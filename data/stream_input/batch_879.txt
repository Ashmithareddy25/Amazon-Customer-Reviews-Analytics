1416599711|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.<br /><br />But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.<br /><br />Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.<br /><br />But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.<br /><br />Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave.will come alive, and never quite leave.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Someone please help me. I first listened to stand by me and I was hooked. What an amazing CD and DVD. I bought 5 of them for my family and friends. I received my 5 copies last week and can't help but listen to it over and over again. I've got my friends all wanting to purchase them a copy. Everyone, and I do mean everyone that hears it loves it. From my youngest grandchildren to my grandkids in college and to my 82 year old mother. I only wished Clarence Bekker would come out with a CD, I would pay $100 for it. What an amazing voice. My hat is off to Mark Johnson what a great idea he had. I hope you sell 50 million copies to help your movement. Peace through music why can't everyone hear the peace.
0471267554|4.0|I really enjoyed this.  The information makes sense to me - not just my brain, but my physical intuition resonates with this way of eating.  I was so grateful when it came out because I had suspected, in recent years, that our genetic history should dictate our diet.  I do think we should have more detailed background on what our specific ancestors ate.<br /><br />For instance, I have a native American friend who, through process of elimination & re-introduction has discovered she can eat beans and corn with no problems whereas I cannot. Her ancestors have had enough time to adapt to a diet including them.  I suspect the grain barley would be OK for me because it was eaten for thousands of years by my Celtic ancestors.  Orientals probably have foods they are genetically predisposed to deal with just fine.<br /><br />But this is a really good start on what I hope will become a more detailed subject for some researcher in the future.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|I love how this movie takes up where Casino Royale leaves off.  It only took a couple of minutes into the movie to realize what was going on.  Lots of Bond action, which I like, and a little more of the sexiness that we all expect from James Bond.

B000I0QM0E|2.0|I think this is a wonderfully entertaining movie, so I just don't understand the negative reviews. However, this review is not about the movie, but about the particular transfer of the first US Blu-Ray edition. It is true, as other reviewers say, that it is grany, and it shouldn't...a BR should not have this grain, because it is not in the original movie, unlike other cases (e.g., \\"The godfather\\", where the grain is an essential part of the original look of the movies). Paramount did not bother to provide anything but the standard Dolby Digital and DTS sound, no improvement at all in the sound department, and there should have been. This said...hey, we're talking about high definition here. The level of detail is really much better than in any DVD edition (I compared it with my DVD in the same player). Backgrounds and CG shots are much more detailed, and the textures of clothes, furniture, and objects are much more realistic and alive. So, it still deserves a better treatment in Blu-Ray, but, for the time being, it is the best version you can watch, specially if you are tired of the pixels in your large TV set.
0312370849|5.0|A hanting, riveting novel of life under the German occupation and why it's still so painful for many Frenchmen to acknowledge this terrible chapter in their history. It's 1942 in Paris when ten-year-old Sarah and her family learn they are to be arrested in the shocking Vel' d' Hiv' roundup of the Jews, the most horrible example of French collaboration with the Nazis. However, Sarah is a bright girl and before the police come she locks her little brother Michel in a cupboard, their favorite hiding place, thinking she will be back in a few hours to get him. But sadly it's not to be as all the Jews in the roundup are sent to concentration camps where most of them die.<br /><br />Sixty years later an American journalist, Julia Jurmond, married to a Frenchman, learns of the notorious roundup of so long ago and is not only horrified but shocked by the government's silence and the ignorance of the general population. Determined to investigate and find the truth she stumbles upon a long-hidden family secret as she traces Sarah's ordeal, which causes her to question not only the validity of her marriage but also her life. A complelling, heart-wrenching novel that really touches the soul and sheds light on a bad chapter in French history.

0618918248|1.0|Can you say dawk-dawk-dawKINS? That's the noise his disciples make as they uncritically parrot their hero. But, for those willing to exercise their brains, think independently and do just a little homework, it quickly becomes obvious that Dawkins' conversational skills are limited to slinging mud and constructing \\"straw man\\" arguments out of his opponents' positions in order to make them easier to refute. That's what losers of a debate do when they've been backed into a corner, and Dawkins plays the part perfectly. You've got to be pretty deep into Dawkins worship to miss that point but, fortunately, there are a few atheists out there who are intellectually honest enough to give this book only \\"average\\" reviews, admitting that it is far from being the best in its class. Not even close.    Dawkins is certainly no newcomer to the debate. In \\"The God Delusion,\\" he presents himself as an \\"expert\\" not just on his own atheistic / evolutionist worldview, but on religion in general and Christianity in particular. However, Dawkins repeatedly gets his facts wrong when discussing the positions of those with whom he disagrees. How could this be? There are only two possibilities:    1) Dawkins misrepresents his opponents' position out of ignorance. Thus, he is a poor researcher, and not worthy of being taken seriously.    OR    2) Dawkins misrepresents his opponents' position intentionally. Thus, he is a liar, and not worthy of being taken seriously.    I don't believe Dawkins reached his level of prominence by being a poor researcher. Therefore, the only choice remaining is that his misrepresentation is intentional. To intentionally misrepresent things requires that one first know the truth, yet choose to ignore it in order to advance one's own agenda. That's called lying.    Why anyone would willingly follow a man who has been exposed as a deceiver is a mystery, but these reviews clearly show that there are a lot of people who will accept whatever they are told without checking the facts for themsleves.    But not everyone is as hypocritical as Dawkins: Witness this quote by the famous Harvard evolutionist Richard Lewontin, who openly admits what really drives the atheist / evolutionist worlview (capitalization and translations added for emphasis):    \\"We take the side of science IN SPITE OF the patent ABSURDITY of some of its constructs, IN SPITE OF its FAILURE to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life, IN SPITE OF the tolerance of the scientific community for UNSUBSTANTIATED just-so stories, because WE HAVE A PRIOR COMMITMENT TO MATERIALISM [translation: not based on evidence, but on faith!] ... We are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, NO MATTER HOW COUNTER-INTUITIVE [translation: even if it's totally illogical!], no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is an ABSOLUTE, for we CANNOT allow a Divine Foot in the door.\\"    In other words, folks, leading atheist evolutionists - the ones you adore - don't CARE what the evidence shows ... they aren't interested in the facts, and they're hoping you won't ask any questions or hold them accountable for what they say. Indeed, their only desire is to cling to the belief that evolution is true and that there is no God, because the alternative ... no matter how strong the evidence ... is simply unacceptable! Let's hear it for Harvard! Quality stuff!    But at least Lewontin was honest enough to admit he was promoting something he knew has no basis in true science. I wish we could say as much for Dawkins. This book is nothing but a diatribe against that which Dawkins himself obviously knows to be true, but arrogantly refuses to admit. His straw man arguments had already been more than adequately refuted long before this book was written, and he knows it.     Not surprisingly, there is nothing original in these pages. But denying reality is Dawkins' means of making a living, so he releases this pile of regurgitated falsehoods. There is no truth here, only agenda. The only delusion evident in these pages is the idea that Dawkins and his book of foolish tirades are somehow scientific. Funny, but that seems to be the underlying theme of all his writing.    In the end, Dawkins is to science what Paris Hilton is to acting. Ultimately, he's only famous for being famous, and his book is merely his latest vehicle for what amounts to nothing more than incoherent and inaccurate ranting and raging against his opponents.    Dawkins remains in the public eye because it is not truth, but attention, that he seeks. And if he can sell a few million books to the ignorant masses, such as the ones who glorify him in their reviews ... well guess who's laughing all the way to the bank? It isn't his disciples!
0141031484|4.0|This book was written before Black Swan, the book that made Taleb famous. It is based on his experience on Wall Street as well as his education in statistics and the math of randomness. It taught me. It has some flaws in its writing, including repetiveness and lack of thorough editing, but it is well worth reading. A very good introduction to the application of a formal understanding of randomness to life.

1892005034|5.0|What began as a search for a better discipline system for our 6 yr old has turned out to be a philosophical approach and communication tool that is transforming how we relate to each other and ourselves.     We originally set out on this journey because our current discipline method with our 6 yr old (a reward/consequence system) was no longer working and we were getting into escalating cycles of defiance/threats/punishment with him. We began with the small booklet Raising Children Compassionately - and I think it helped to have this brief overview before plunging into the NVC book.     Like other things worth doing, this one has taken consistent work and patience on our part. The first week - in which we were letting go of our old ways and clumsily trying out some of the new ways - felt, at times, like being on a turbulent river in a small boat with just a couple of wooden paddles to steer us around the rapids. Our son was acting out (e.g., refusing to do HW, whining, arguing) and instead of punishing, threatening and coercing him we were trying to problem solve using the methods - and more importantly - the goals - of NVC. I am glad we hung in there during that transition period and patiently and imperfectly kept at it. Although it was taking a lot more time and effort, we could tell - even in the beginning - that the approach was working as well as our old \\"1-2-3 you lose a privilege\\" chart - minus the hurt feelings, tantrums, and moping that resulted.    After about 2-3 weeks, we began to notice unexpected side benefits. We still had to work hard to resolve situations every time our needs did not coincide with those of our child - but we were finding that we were not nearly as drained at the end of the day as when we had been exerting our control over him and aiming for obedience. At the same time, as we were applying the system and actively working on the approach, we began to communicate with each other (as a couple) in a more peaceful, respectful, and less blaming manner. Other small benefits followed. A phone call with mom about a difficult subject went surprisingly well. A visit with the in-laws was unusually smooth and light. I was able to re-establish communication with a colleague I had been sort of avoiding at work because of what I had perceived as his caustic ways. Even our 6 yr old began to speak to his 2 yr old sister with more patience and kindness.    Most interestingly of all, I have begun to feel more connected to myself: to what I need, feel, and why.    I want to emphasize that the system has not been a magic wand but more like a road map to a way of being. We have been very imperfect at it, losing our temper and our connections with each other many times since we set out on this journey a month ago. However, unlike other behavioral systems, in which \\"inconsistency\\" seems to erode positive outcomes, every successful effort at connection, using NVC, has been like a paving stone that, once put down, has remained in place patiently waiting for the next one. The result has been a slowly emerging road of consciousness and connection with each other that we are able to walk on even as we build it.

Bascially this just sounds like a Dio album with Black Sabbath backing him up. If you want good Black Sabbath with Dio, get Mob Rules. The others are about the same as well. They shot their wad long ago and are an impotent force in heavy metal. Time to head to Florida guys and hang up the music careers, you'll sell on your names alone, that's always the case with icons. But the music, give it, and yourselves a rest.
B00002ND77|5.0|I grew up in the civil rights era, whose public face for us (in the suburbs) was the reasonable MLKing.  The other side - the violence and militancy, the hate that hate produced - was only dimly heard, seemingly much farther away.  It was a great shock for me to read Haley's autobio, but utterly fascinating and important to understand who we Americans are.<br /><br />Spike Lee has taken the Haley version and grafted almost all of the important incidents into a single long film.  In my viewing, it is almost completely successful in evoking an extraordinary life.  You get the factual outline, and better yet the feeling for what it was like in X's times.<br /><br />From the opening, when he is swaggering in a zoot suit with Shorty, to his seething rage at the memory of how his family was dissolved by race hatred and lynching.  It is superlatively acted by Washington, who is one of the greatest actors alive.  You then follow X into crime, a dissolute life style, prison, redemption, the acceptance of fundamentalist mind programming, to a final stage of questioning it all.  I completely believed the portrait of how he grew into all of these roles with extraordinary ease as well as the mercurial energy of a genius.<br /><br />Lee succeeds in making X a near archetype for the American experience for blacks but also for the entire society, which we must admit to ourselves is intimately inter-related.  These are deep questions, and Lee is content to provoke, in my viewing, leaving the audience vexed and interested in finding out more.  It is positively Brechtian in ambition, and here it truly works here.  And there is a raft of extraordinary personalities who appear and re-appear, enabling us to see where they were able to go and what they could do.<br /><br />There are a few things that mar with the simplifications of the film medium.  For example, there is the fate of the girl Laura, who is in the Haley book.  While in real life she disappears from view though we learn what happened to her,  you see X walk by her in his Moslem guise as she is about to service a client in a doorway.  Other incidents are too succinct, such as his dismissal of the idealistic white girl who asked how she might help (which he later pointedly regretted), but then Lee had only 3 hours and there is so much to tell.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  X tells us all a lot about who we are as Americans and even as humans.  I believe he continues to fascinate because he died at a moment when he was ripe with potential to change.  This film made me weep, once again, as I did in my youth with the book.walk by her in his Moslem guise as she is about to service a client in a doorway.

0307454894|4.0|Fifteen year old Michael Berg gets sick on his way home from school one day and he is helped by Hanna Schmitz.  After he's better, he goes by to thank Hanna and they embark on an affair.  He sees her as often as possible and when Hanna asks Michael what he's studying in school, he begins reading to her.  Their affair continues until Hanna mysteriously leaves town one day.    Michael doesn't see Hanna again until he's a law student attending the trial of Nazi war criminals for a seminar he's taking.  He's shocked to see Hanna is one of the female guards being tried.  He attends the trial every day and slowly comes to the realization that Hanna is illiterate. While he's attending the trial, Michael thinks,        \\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it.  But it was too terrible for that.  When I tried to understand it, I had the feeling I was failing to condemn it as it must be condemned.  When I condemned it as it must be condemned, there was no room for understanding.\\"    Hanna accepts more blame, and a harsher sentence because of it, rather than admit to the shame of being illiterate.  After Hanna is in prison for several years, Michael starts recording books on cassette tapes and mailing them to her, because he can't get her out of his mind.  After several years in prison, Hanna writes Michael and note and he says,        \\"I read the note and was filled with joy and jubilation.  \\"She can write, she can write!\\" In these years I had read everything I could lay my hands on to do with illiteracy.  I knew about the helplessness in everyday activities, finding one's way or finding an address or choosing a meal in a restaurant, about how illiterates anxiously stick to prescribed patterns and familiar routines, about how much energy it takes to conceal one's inability to read and write, energy lost to actual living.  Illiteracy is dependence.\\"    Wow,  The Reader by Bernhard Schlink is a book full of controversial subjects!  If this book doesn't make you think, nothing will.  It would make a great book club pick because there is just so much to talk about in it.  First is the love affair between a minor and a grown woman.  During the war trial, Michael never absolves the guards of guilt, but questions how much of the blame the society that allowed the atrocities to go on should shoulder.  I was struck by how many of the choices in Hanna's life were made because of her shame in being illiterate.  It made me even more thankful that I can read.  This book does contain sexual situations, but I recommend it and the movie that was made from it.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|She's flying underneath the radar right now compared to acts like Leona Lewis or Adele. I think she's definitely better than Leona Lewis, but did not get the credentials she deserved at the Grammys. This album is amazing and sounds very 60s'-70's soul. I didn't think I would like it, but it's one of my favorite albums and she should definitely be getting much more attention compared to acts like Amy Winehouse. The album is so good that you can listen to it from start to finish. Buy this album today, you won't be disappointed.

B000OLGCHA|5.0|Let me say it right off the bat:  I really, really like this score. I have to admit my expectations weren't very high when I found out an unknown composer (to me, at least) named Nicholas Hooper was writing the music.  Like anyone can adequately fill the Hagrid-size shoes of John Williams!  I didn't think Patrick Doyle came anywhere close.  His score for \\"Goblet of Fire\\" was all action, no theme.  So, never having heard of Nicholas Hooper, I figured this would be one less soundtrack I'd be compelled to buy.  Boy, was I wrong.  There's not one cut on the CD I don't look forward to hearing over and over.  Some favorites:  \\"The Hall of Requirements\\", \\"Flight of the Order of the Phoenix\\", \\"Dumbledore's Army\\" and \\"Fireworks\\" (love that electric guitar).    Do I think Hooper is in the same class as Williams?  Probably not, but time will tell.  (And let me confess right now that I've been a huge John Williams fan since \\"The Reivers\\", so I'm a tad biased.) I don't think it's fair to compare the score of \\"Phoenix\\" to the first three Potter compositions.  Whereas the tone of those movies, like the books, is a more lighthearted mix of mystery and fantasy, the storyline of \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" is darker, more serious; the music has to reflect these more foreboding themes.  Hooper is more than up to the task by giving the music a unique voice without straying too far from its predecessors; the brief references to \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" do the trick.      While I respect the opinion of other reviewers, I have to chuckle over the notion that not only does a composer have to create a score that enhances, without detracting from, what's onscreen, and yet is melodic enough to stand apart from the film, it also has to be consistently audible while driving a car.  Yikes.  Like there aren't enough restrictions and requirements for the composer to adhere to.  Face it, some music just has to be heard on land-based sound systems to be appreciated.     My biggest complaint about the soundtrack release, actually my only one, is the same one expressed by many of the other listeners:  the sequencing of tracks is terrible.  Like others, I prefer listening to tracks in the order they appeared in the movie.  If I want to rearrange them on my iTunes playlist I have that option, but I wish all scores would default to the screen sequence.    I'm looking forward to Hooper's score to \\"The Half-Blood Prince\\" and his future endeavors.  And you can bet I won't be previewing any of them on my car speakers!
B001E2JNA6|4.0|My wife loves this mini-series. While the frame-by-frame restoration from 16mm film was good, my wife particularly noticed the improvement in the sound track. She said she could clearly hear dialog that was previously unintelligible. The PCM track is only 2-channel stereo, but it was made for TV. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't surround sound.    If you are a Jane Austen fan, you will like this release. My wife watches this at least two or three times a year, and I confess I often watch it with her. It took me a while to get into the story, but the language is \\"Shakespearesk\\". (Nobody ever talked like that, but it was fun and refreshing to listen to the performance spoken in that manner that is uniquely Jane Austen.)    Picture quality was very good considering that it was an old film to digital transfer. My wife feels that it was worth upgrading from the DVD release.

1416914307|4.0|I continue to be impressed with Clare's ability to combine material from other stories into something quite different.  She's still borrowing heavily from the Buffy and Star Wars canon, but Clare has brought her trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.  The background behind Jace and Clary's supposed siblinghood is revealed, and some explanation is given for the startling abilities Clary exhibits in previous books.  Although some of the explanations and resolutions are fairly predictable, the process of getting to them is enjoyable.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters when it came out and fell in love with Wall-E and EVE and the Axiom. Some people may be hesitant to watch due to the lack of dialogue, but I LOVE IT! The movie just works...it flows smoothly and is adorable - it also has a great message to our bigger-and-better culture.   I loved the three disk copy...it isn't that much more expensive than the one-disk and you get a lot more. It has silly extras from the making of Wall-E and special shorts from Buy-n-Large. I haven't used the Digital Copy yet...I'm waiting to get a better video-playing Mp3 device.      The one thing about this copy that I wasn't impressed with was the packaging. It came in this flimsy, strange cardboard case instead of a normal plastic DVD case. It makes the disks hard to get out and there is nowhere for the instruction (for the digital copy) paper to go. I am careful with my DVDs, but I have a feeling that this particular case is going to wear out very quickly.   All-in-all, this is a great copy to buy if you have seen Wall-E and love it.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I was able to see an early showing of Star Trek on Saturday. Reactions seemed pretty unanimous on the way out.<br /><br />When the USS Kelvin is attacked by Romulans, they are quickly overwhelmed by the massive, enemy vessel. The Romulan leader, Nero, is looking for vengeance, and focuses on Spock. But Nero and his crew are from the future. Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the incredibly young crew of the USS Enterprise must discover Nero's plans and stop him before he takes out his revenge on the entire Federation.<br /><br />From beginning to end, this was a non-stop action-packed revamp to the Star Trek franchise. As a fan of the original Star Trek series, I came in a bit sceptic about other actors playing iconic roles, but wanted to be surprised. J.J. Abrams satisfied all of my worries.<br /><br />The casting was supurb. Chris Pine as Jim Kirk was completely believable as the hot-headed, ladies-man, with a legendary destiny. And Zachary Quinto as Spock was inspired. I was afraid that I'd only be able to picture him as a creepy serial killer, but I never once thought of his Heroes` character. He just became Spock. The banter between Kirk, Spock, and Karl Urban's Dr. McCoy was especially humorous and heart-warming. Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and Scotty (Simon Pegg) all had their scene-stealing moments as well.<br /><br />Eric Bana as Nero was reminiscent of Khan from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. His motive is pure vengeance. And the odds are in his favor with his ship, advanced technology, and knowledge of the future. But when the odds are against them and the situation is grim is when Kirk works best.<br /><br />The special effects were fantastic. The battle scenes in space were particularly incredible. The story was able to pacify a die-hard fan like me, as well as leave room for future installments. But the shining highlight for me, was hearing the familiar, and often beloved, sayings from the Enterprise crew. And being able to accept them from newer, younger actors. It was wonderful seeing Leonard Nimoy as older Spock, and it was great to have his character play an integral role in the story.<br /><br />Star Trek is full of excitement, suspense, and plenty of humor. Life-long fans as well as people with only a passing knowledge of Star Trek will enjoy this all-around excellent film. It's sure to be a summer blockbuster, with a new generation of fans. I can't wait to see it again.tors. It was wonderful seeing Leonard Nimoy as older Spock, and it was great to have his character play an integral role in the story.

B001TOD92C|4.0|I love movies like this, very realistic and full of real dramatic situations. Mick is great, Marisa, wow!    This movie feels like a documentary, camera work, the story, character interactions are all so real.    I'm not a wrestling fan but I enjoyed the movie, it's a rental for me but maybe a keeper for the fans of the sport.
B000FVNX2Q|1.0|I would recommend against buying this model or an HP calculator at this time.  Always a reliable calculator in the past, on the recent 12c model I bought several of the keys no longer work.   HP has a very limited one year warranty (my last one worked steadily for over 10 years), and I can't help but wonder if they're using cheaper parts to get the price down from where it was several years ago.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|The Bottom Line:    There Will Be Blood represents a 160 minutes of dark and brooding themes--it's certainly not a movie for everyone--but P.T. Anderson is such a talented director and Daniel Day-Lewis offers his usual intensity that I hope you will take the time to watch this challenging but rewarding take on American greed.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|I purchased this so that I could project streaming video from my laptop to my HD television via an HDMI cable.  I have a MacBook Pro that I purchased in December of 2008 and this adapter works perfectly.  The video is streamed to the TV which acts as a second monitor that is \\"virtually\\" off to the right of the laptop screen. You have to drag the viewing window to the far right of the laptop screen.  As the window disappears to the right, it will come into view on the TV. The quality is excellent. I found that I had to connect everything together and then turn on the TV so that it would recognize the input.  You may also need to go in and tweak your monitor settings on the laptop.  You will also need an audio cable which you attach to the headphone jack and then the audio in on the TV. This product does what I bought it to do. I have no complaints.
B001WCN232|2.0|One of the more underrated Stones records imho. Sounds marginally better than the Virgin remaster.<br />If you are going to ask a fan/sucker to buy a CD a third time why not give an incentive. An LP sleeve? An insert? And extra track? I feel like a sucker.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This piece is so awesome and moved me to such tears of delight that I just had to leave a little acknowledgment.<br /><br />  Even though I've spent a few $10,000's over the years with Amazon and always been satisfied, until now I have never felt moved to submit a review of anything I have purchased.<br /><br />  In the days of brick and mortar only I almost certainly would have never encountered this music.<br /><br />  Thanks to sites like Vimeo and Amazon my world is so much finer!  Thanks to everyone.
B000JLSM00|5.0|What a beautiful restoration of a classic American film. What the Blu-Ray format is doing for classic films like this is not just visually jaw-dropping but important preservationist work! The price for this Blu-Ray is a steal. Those, including me, who have disparged John Wayne's acting will eat their words after viewing \\"The Searchers.\\" No wonder this film is mandatory viewing in many film study classes.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I liked this movie, as I usually like books & movies that follow characters through extended time.  The special effects were very good, allowing viewers to see how time changes everyone.  Yes it is an unbelievable story, but so are alien movies, and plenty of other films.  This is a long movie, and a sweet as well as heartbreaking story.  Some historical events are portrayed, but again this is a story for the imagination - not a true life biography.  Grab your popcorn and your imagination on a rainy afternoon, enjoy the story...

B000MQ54OO|5.0|People who gave this film less than 3 stars anger me. This was one of the better children's movies released in the past few years. It has great classic messages that are lost in a lot of kids movies these days; themes that are very important and real for kids to learn that aren't fluffy and cute; themes such as sacrifice, danger and death. Children's movies protect our kids too much these days.    Our adult cinema has gone in the polar opposite direction. Most of it is littered with sex and violence. What we really need to learn is that moderation is key. I thought this film was perfect. Sex is a real topic - we needn't flaunt sex around children, but we also mustn't pretend it doesn't exist. This movie handles sex in an appropriate way.    One comment I read docked this film for appealing to multiple audiences. Hmmm. I don't really understand why that is a bad thing. The writer also said that the film lacked focus because it had multiple plot lines (the penguin dealing with his inability to sing, and then with the lack of fish caused by humans). I'd have to disagree there too. This person mustn't have taken any English in college. Many of the world's greatest stories venture away from the dull, slow and steady, up hill clime to the climax,  and then down until the end. This film just follows a less traditional pattern, which is completely fine and refreshing. This movie ties many themes together, and in such an intricate and smooth way, that some of them go unnoticed to the untrained eye. One such, is the spank on religion which I will talk about in the next paragraph. But before I do, I just want to point out that the transition from the first conflict (the penguin not being able to sing) led perfectly into the second (no fish/scarcity and pollution). The factor that tied the plot together was the fact that the elders in the penguin culture were the common opponent. They didn't like that the little penguin couldn't sing and that he was a dancer, and they fought against the little penguin when he tried to solve the fish scarcity problem. The elders are the common element. This was a really well written script, despite what some uneducated people have written in other comments here. Proof in what I say can be found in the cast. Great actors and actresses chose to do this script - that should tell you something.     This film is also amazing because it tackles some, rather, modern themes eg pollution, religion, and the need for humans to become more ecologically aware. First, the pollution references are obvious. Second, this film is AMAZING because it detests the ridiculousness of religion. The movie brings to light the superstition inherent in all religion. You ever find yourself praying to God to help you through a rough time? Well, that sort of activity is just as nonsensical as penguins praying to a penguin-god to deliver fish. Also, this film underscores how religion has been the enemy of progressive thought over the ages. Those in power have used religion as a tool to control the masses. Dancing is a metaphor in this film. It represents breaking away from traditional ways when they prove to be untrue. There are many others little hacks at religion, that I feel are completely necessary for children to be exposed to. Children need to hear both sides of the argument. I am so happy that a film had the guts to take that step.     Last, the film does a wonderful job, again through metaphor, of emphasizing the need for humans to take their place in the circle of life. The scene at the end, where the humans and penguins dance together represents a message: that we can all live together, in harmony, on this earth.    Honorable mention comments: this film was filled with great music, great actors, and amazing animation. AND, it wasn't filled with cheesy one liners like most children's films these days. AND the final message: LOVE = LOVE is something we all need to pay attention to. John Lennon would be proud...
B00006LLNU|5.0|It is not uncommon to invoke the spiritual when describing Sigur Ros' work.  As I have tried to write a review of \\"()\\" that does the recording any justice at all, I have been tempted to follow suit.  Sigur Ros seems to convey an undeniable reverence for music that is difficult to describe using any other term.  \\"()\\" is serious and respectful, giving the impression that for Sigur Ros, music is not to be taken lightly.  It has meaning and significance.  Often, such significance is dictated to the listener by lyric text, but Sigur Ros' deliberate choice to sing in a synthesized language begs the question: what exactly des Sigur Ros' music signify?  What does it point to?<br /><br />Upon listening to \\"(),\\" I would suggest that it points out and away.  It extends and reaches out in ways that can only be suggested musically.  Sound itself extends from well-defined center and in so doing, has the ability to reveal something about the interior of things.  If a person claps inside an empty cathedral, it says something about that space.  I often characterize some styles of music as \\"claustrophobic,\\" as is the case with Tool or Mastodon.  \\"()\\" is not that.  The interiority of \\"()\\" is vast.  It is free of any spatial boundary that might be perceived in the listening experience.<br /><br />Other groups have explored this terrain, most obviously Pink Floyd in their classic composition \\"Echoes.\\"  Vastness creates a reflective, lonely, self-searching aesthetic that can be programmatically interpreted in several subjective ways - open plains of ice, a clear sky, or simply falling through space.  All of these scenarios, however, share a sense of simultaneous isolation from humanity and solidarity with the universe.  As modern humans, we very rarely (if ever) get a chance to experience this sensation in the fullest sense.<br /><br />As a result, \\"()\\" is disquieting, emotionally explosive, musically sparse, and unapologetically organic.  In other words, it is a decidedly human recording.  I seriously doubt that a click track was used at all, and if so very little.  Instead, it seems the band was unleashed in the studio allowing the music to take hold.  As a result, tempos change subtly to fit mood, and song structure is loosely arranged around intuitive avenues rather than strict forms.  Simple melodic figures are often presented and patiently allowed to evolve into hair-raising wails that seem to reverberate to the edges of reality.<br /><br />The Lowdown:  I have found it extremely challenging to write a review of any of Sigur Ros' work, and even more so with \\"().\\"  It is an unbelievably beautiful recording that tugs on my emotions in the most inexplicable way.bt that a click track was used at all, and if so very little.

B00005JN8Z|3.0|Quo Vadis was shot in full aperture 1:33 and from that format, they go dow to the 1:33 Academy aperture. They shot full aperture 1:33 to have a bigger negative, but they had to go down to academy aperture 1:33 to have room to put the sound track.  Resulting in better picture with sound.  Of course, Quo Vadis without Peter Usinov would not be Quo Vadis (the only real stage actor full of emotion and interpretation. A genius) R.Taylor is good in Roman Commander. The production is very hollywood style. Beautiful costumes (Too beautiful to be true !) But I liked the movie. Of course I preffer Gladiator . Better movie and acting (Except for Ustinov in Quo Vadis).   Quo Vadis is a good movie. Too bad that we can notice his age. Too hollywood for me!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The first Godfather was released the year I was born (1972), but I didn't first see it until the mid-80's. Same goes for Part II ('74).     Despite the criticisms when it first came out, I first appreciated the grandioseness of this trilogy when I saw Part III in '91 and I thought it was an amazing and dramatic piece of work (especially the great score and dramatic opera scenes towards the end), which then led me to want to see parts I and II. My parents gave me a great education on them when we watched them together and I realized why these are must-have films for any movie collector.  My parents are retired commercial artists and they and many of their colleagues in the art field all consider the series not just \\"movies\\", but true works of art (particularly parts 1 and 2) and so do I!     A year or two back I bought the DVD trilogy and was particularly impressed with the audio/video quality of the first 2 (part 3 was and is still relatively modern and already looked pretty good and sounded pretty darn great in VHS Hi-Fi.) But of course, the DVD was worlds ahead of the VHS (not just image-wise, but Parts I & II also went from flat mono sound to crisp-sounding 5.1, which really brought them to life) and were surely the best it could look and sound... until I watched my Blu ray last night!    Now, in terms of video/audio quality, what others say here is true. First, it's not a \\"reference\\" Blu ray disc e.g., \\"Iron Man\\" or \\"Transformers\\". They restored the film as best they could without \\"tampering\\" with it. There is a good amount of film grain and a honeyish color tinge throughout that gave the film the \\"sepia\\" look of films from the 30s and 40s. Some will be turned off by that, but that is how Mr. Coppola intended to be.   But having said that, as my headline states, seeing Part I on Blu ray truly was like seeing it for the first time!     First, considering that there are so many dark scenes in the movie (purposely filmed that way and always harder for home video toreproduce) there is still an impressive amount of detail instead of the typical \\"mush\\" you saw in other formats. The outdoor scenes (except for the first outdoor scene at the beginning which I thought looked a tad too over-bright at times) were incredibly crisp, detailed and amazing to look at. (Especially the scenes in Italy where Michael tries to `hide' and gets married... the detail in the scenery and the colors were so amazing, I went back and watched it again!). The Dolby True-HD sound-quality is also stellar. I have a somewhat modest 5.1 home theater in a box and it sounded A-LOT newer than a 1972 film. I was impressed both by the \\"crispiness\\" of the treble and the fullness of the bass as well as the directionality of the sound effects. I think it definitely sounded better than the DVD version. (Imagine if I had a 7.1 HDMI receiver!). As for the special features, all the ones you loved from the DVD are in the Blu ray set, with many in HD!    All in all, this is simply a no-brainer Blu ray purchase. These films could not possibly look or sound any better even if you bought a film projector and a screen! To top it all off, Amazon's unbelievable price of $52.99 for this Blu ray set is LESS than the $60 I paid for the regular DVD set!!! Buy this set right here, right now on Amazon! Other retailers are selling this same set for $85 to over $100...Thanks so much, Amazon, for making so many great Blu ray discs like these very affordable for the rest of us!

B000ULLNDW|5.0|Carole King released TAPESTRY and it suddenly became a classic. Surprise? Of course not. It remained one of the most successful record of all time, and the ultimate reason was that Carole composed, wrote and sang from deep in her heart, and all she did caught the very beat of our hearts. Although SONY/BMG released a CD+DVD edition, but this remastered edition with  bonus tracks will surely be many fans' favourite.  Today, we won't see Carole as just a singer. She's a heroine who brought famale power to a deep impact into music history. Even though she can't be as popular as she was in 1970s. She never changes, it's just we who have changed, but something beautiful always remains.
B00005JPY2|1.0|Watchmen was a mess of a movie with some good points in it. There are some huge logical/philosophical flaws in movie, so I'll start with those.    Dr. Manhattan is supposed to be a brilliant research scientist before his accident, yet he is stupid enough to accidentally walk into ground zero of an experiment that he likely designed and scheduled. The odds that he'd even be leaving the building to go somewhere else while such an important experiment in his department is going is implausible, much less a man of such intelligence being so absent-minded to walk into a dangerzone that he designed and oversees. SECONDLY, where are the security measures to prevent someone from walking in the wrong place and dying or being mutated? I'm willing to suspend my disbelief pretty easily, but this is just stupid. Would you believe Einstein made a weapon, scheduled a test, and then walked in front of it because he forgot his hat? Come on.    The idea of the universe being a clock without a clock maker is the most nonscientific fairytale that could exist. Science involves determining the contents of an object and then determining where those contents came from and how they came together to form the current object, what is keeping them together currently, and lastly what will happen to them in the future. The clock without a maker is more ridiculous than saying a magic fairy came along and went, \\"Poof, here's your clock.\\" At least in the magic fairy scenario, there is a cause and effect theory in place. There is no cause and effect in a clock without a maker, and science is cause and effect. The clock without a clockmaker is effect (existence) without a cause. Is the magic fairy example ridiculous? Sure it is. That's my entire point. It's completely ridiculous, and it's still more scientific than the clock without a clockmaker. The mere idea that one of the smartest scientists who ever lived could believe such nonsense is beyond ludicrous.    The editing is terrible. There is no reason to show The Silk Spectre II making up with her mother in the end. No one cares. Her mother is not on screen enough for anyone to care about her. We barely care about The Silk Spectre II as it is, much less her mother.    Now the nudity. I saw this in a packed IMAX theater on opening night with diehard fans. You won't ever get more of a receptive audience than that. The first 12 times they showed Manhattan's penis, the crowd kept quiet. By the 50th penis flash the entire audience of 400 people or more were laughing and mocking the movie. When your entire audience laughs at your gratuitous nudity that yields nothing to the plot, you failed. Isn't that the same thing that 80s horror movies are ridiculed for? It's not art in the Watchmen and trash in Friday the 13th Part 7. That audience was the ideal one for this movie, and the constant nudity was unanimously labeled ridiculous.    The fact that The Nite Owl II and The Silk Spectre II are so cowardly in the big confrontation scene destroys any sympathy or interest in them. The end result does not justify the means. There is no reason for them to be so spineless and compromising in the end.    There are good things in this mix though.    The acting is pretty solid all around. The problems are not with the execution in making the movie, but the original idea in the first place. Rorschach is an awesome character portrayed perfectly. The scenes with Rorschach are so good that it's a shame there are so many other problems with the film. The decision he makes in the end is awesome. Rorschach is interesting enough to make a movie/graphic novel entirely about him.     The lighting and cinematography made it beautiful to look at. The only problem is sifting through all of the above garbage to get to it is not worth the effort.    I am a comic book fan, and this is the worst movie I've seen this year.

B000VD5I94|5.0|This was a favorite of mine when I was a kid yes it's a violent movie but hey I seen it in 1997 and but was unfortunate enough to see the 2nd movie first infact I was 7 or 8 when I saw it and I also seen Terminator 1&2 when I was 10. But this film is about a cop who is gunned down by a gang lead by crime boss Clearance Bodicker played by Kurtwood Smith he gets away with anythiing becuse he's protected by Dick Jones played by Ronny Cox. He's a corprate head who even kills a corporate VP out of jelousy becuse Ropocop is cleaning up the streets he used to be officer Alex Murphy he is played by Peter Weller his former partner Ann Lewis played by Nancy Allen tries to help him remember he is Alex Murphy he starts to figure out he was once human. This Blu Ray released has the more violent death of Murphy and a more violent death of an OCP employee by ED 209 because he's a piece of Junk that's faulty. Easy 8.5/10
0307346617|4.0|The book wasn't the type of book that you could never put down, but it was very enjoyable. If you are a fan of Zombies or Max Brooks, then i suggest reading this. The way it was written was wonderful and refreshing. It was also a good commentary on modern day politics and society. The book managed to open my mind greatly and made me think. It brings up thing you would not normally think about or ponder when watching a zombie movie, reading a zombie book, or whenever the topic of zombies are brought up.<br /><br />I felt the book could have done without the last chapter, but luckily it was rather short. It was also, sometimes, hard to keep track of certain terms and words that were 'made up' or just out of my knowledge. A lot of astrics *. All-in-all, i am very glad that i read this book.
B0013FSL3E|2.0|Hi I'm an 21 year old autistic adult who sat down and watched this movie Wall-e thinking it would be like any other children's movie not creepy well I was wrong way wrong!  Let me tell you I have never been more creeped out from watching a cartoon movie ever before but this movie is just plain out creepy. I mean totally on the bizarre side the only thing that was cute was the little robot Wall-e besides from that.  I would'nt recommend this movie to anyone.<br /><br />Whatever you do save your money this movie is not worth it.  Do what I do rent movie's from the library then if you like the movie then buy it but other wise don't waste your money on this one.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Yes, this is worth the money. Yes, I was pleased with the dealer -- speedy shipment, packaged well, dvds in excellent condition. Yes, I would purchase again from this dealer.     While the main character appears from time to time in Dr. Who episodes , you don't have to know anything about Dr. Who to enjoy Torchwood. It's so good, and I heartily recommend this dvd collection. For fans of mystery, sci fi, detective movies, Torchwood is that and more.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|Hollywood has made enough big, sweeping 'lifetimes-condensced-in-two to three-hours' movies, that things had better leave a really,really, really powerful and lasting impact or you'll find yourself doing what I did, literally hitting the fast forward button to get to the gist of each the overly staged, overly dramatacized 'life stages' , that started becoming super predictable. It's like, ok, here we're going to see Pitt's father come back into the picture and reconcile, then later die. check. Here we see his tug boat captain, and later we'll see his demise.check. ...here we see Pitt's mother who raised him, who is signifigantly older now, and by then you KNOW it's a matter of time before we see her funeral, check. ...Here we see his wife suddenly have an unannounced out of the blue change of heart and move back to new orleans (but by now, your not surprised), check....Oops , did I give this movie away? Yes, the gravitas of each stage of the movie becomes less and less as literally EVERY scene is overwrought with lifes 'big moment's'...it started to take away from any poignancy it might otherwise have had and made the whole movie feels like a run of the mill hollywood flick, with the typical melodramatic shtick. That was a shame too, because the cinematography is spectacular, and all the little attention to period details made this a great movie to look at. Someone mentioned the great liason scenes between Pitt and Tilda Swinton and that was really a great , intimate part of the movie, both storywise and the beautiful and oozing with atmoshpere hotel lobby where they met each night..But as things move on, your hit two dozen times again, scene to scene with stages in Benjamin's life that shoot for that spectacular grandeur and elegance, and then jump to the next stage, that the whole movie starts to loose something and become sort of typical. Kind of a shame. I also think they could have edited the runtime down, it's a bit too long , and probably would've restored some poignancy. The other thing that I found surprisingly lacking, was it never really felt like Pitt's character was engaging...It's kind of hard to describe, but you never got to see any clever or interesting or unique dialogue that would lead his wife and Swinton's characters to gravitate to him...maybe the idea was they just picked up on his 'specialness'. Pitt just kind of 'low-keyed' it through most of the movie, and it's hard to say if that added any realism. In the end , the visuals are truly fantastic, but the 'start to finish' styled retelling of Benjamins story lost steam as it went on.

On this album he stepped it up a notch, the music is tamer than on ANTICHRIST. I feel personally that this is Manson's led zeppelin 3! I have had this album on cassette since it came out, thought it was time to upgrade. The tape was wearing out. Almost every song is amazing on it, lyrically and musically. I put it at the top of MANSON'S albums. A must have for any Manson fan!!

However the movie is true and honest, even if some people may consider it derogatory for the wrestling business it portrays a reality many wrestlers (and other athletes from other disciplines) face on their lives.<br /><br />I think the best thing about THE WRESTLER is its honesty and the fact that it was made like an indy movie.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are scarce, a Bruce Springsteen video with the theme song, and the excellent documentary Within the Ring which explores how the movie came together in a journal type thing.

B000001FDE|5.0|The Allman Brothers were one of the greatest southern blues/progressive rock bands of the day.  I believe Brothers and Sisters should be remembered more for the classic it really is, and because of the popularity of the two big hits from the album, more people should have reviewed this album here on amazon than what's present so far.    We're talking about an album that feels like it was created to be loved by absolutely everyone, no matter where on the planet you happen to live, which is probably why the album has a slight commercial vibe through most of it.  Of course \\"Ramblin' Man\\" and \\"Jessica\\" have been played on classic rock radio for years, and with good reason- these are classic songs that *never* get old.  My initial feeling when I hear these two classics is that I feel like I'm walking alone beside a field just enjoying life and feeling good while taking a walk and absorbing some sun and great vibes.      What's amazing to me is how, despite the two horrible tragedies the band had to go through back in the early 70's, the one positive that came from all this is that we have an album that's still remembered today, over 35 years later, and I have a strong belief this album will be remembered many more years from now and will be a perfect example to future generations how the blues/southern rock style is supposed to be done- exactly like this.     Remember the great Allman Brothers Band.

B0013BNY2Q|3.0|REM with Michael Stipe have come up with an album that produces a \\"tried and true\\" sound. The group's strength is in its past efforts, however. Any true REM fan should have this in their collection, but I'd personally like to smack the cover artist upside the head. There is nothing attractive about the product, and, if you judge a book by its cover, you will judge this \\"book\\" unworthy.
B00004S367|5.0|What's amazing is that, not only can Stevie Wonder perform music without being able to see, but he can perform music *and* have the ability to write highly enjoyable music while being extremely consistent with his albums.      Another amazing thing about the guy is how he can take pop writing, throw in some funk, great rhythms, melodic vocal melodies and an ability to be original and stand apart from all the other musicians out there, lay all these wonderful ideas down on record, and you have yourself an incredibly talented musician.    Stevie Wonder is just that- very very talented.  As far as Music of My Mind goes, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at the quality of the music he created for this album, and will admire all the high points (which there are many high points).  I think you'll be surprised when you recognize \\"Superwoman\\".  I know I've heard that song somewhere before.  It almost takes my breath away with its beauty and spiritual dreamy feel.  What a classic.    The rest of the album is similar.  It was once said despite being blind Stevie can see more than most people who have perfect vision, and I have to agree with that.  Great album.

With that in mind, pardon any misspellings.

Everything came together and Bella had her family, though the road getting there was not in the least easy.I was very surprised being a senior that I got interested in these books. They were very entertaining and a different idea of vampires and who doesn't enjoy a fun and terrifying love story.

This article is a classic.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This is definately a Vampire Classic.  Twilight was alright and the books are a bit better, but Interview is very well done and the story is great.  If you have any doubts, try finding this in any DVD store.  It sells out faster than any of the other older movies.  I checked almost ALL of San Diego County looking for it and could only get it here.
031606792X|1.0|Everyone who's relative bright cannot completely agree with this book. Sure, maybe you'll enjoy reading it to some extent, but I believe the messages and the overall plot of this book is so transparently just a way for Meyer to put her fantasies of the perfect boyfriend on paper. Her own wantts for a happy ending overrule the personalities of her characters. She controls what her characters do, and her characters have no personality other than what she says for them to have.    Read the longer 1-star reviews. You'll find plenty of reason to loathe this book as well. I have better things to do than talk about how bad this is.
1592332803|5.0|This book is great for both new and experienced bakers.  Having received this book as a gift, I was first impressed with the beautiful color photos (who doesn't love recipe books with photos), then the quality of the recipes. It includes wonderful tips and tricks great for any baking.  Many typically non-vegan standard recipes are included, such as lemon bars (wow), crepes, and baklava - I have had both non-vegans and vegans extremely happy with the baklava!  For the new vegan baker, many of the ingredients are fairly standard and experienced bakers can very easily use alternative sweeteners/flours/oils, et cetera and make the recipe their own.  The recipe ingredients aren't as intimidating as many vegan cookbooks that include ingredients that can only be found in very large cities.      Also, because most of the ingredient measurements are also listed in metric, I was able to bring this book to Italy and impress with vegan baking there.  All around, this book is sure to be a classic on vegan bookshelves with tasty, home-style dishes served with pleasure.

B001TOD92C|4.0|I picked up this film on the strength of Mickey Rourke's presence and Darren Aronofsky's directing. I admit to being ignorant of Professional Wrestling (and titty bars, for that matter), but Aronofsky does a fine job of bringing all the violence and pain that is the stock in trade of this sport to vivid and extremely uncomfortable life.    That Rourke came from these beginnings to ultimately play that which got him started in the first place must feel like coming full-circle for him.     I couldn't believe the size of some of these guys. A couple looked like puffed-up aliens. The hormone and drug cocktails these guys take MUST have detrimental effects, yes?! The life itself is the saddest thing about this film. These men have forsaken everything to be what they are, but being known is not the same as being respected. Rourke's character's private life is evident of that.     While I am not as neurotic as the woman at the deli counter wanting EXACT weight, I darn sure wouldn't take that kind of crap, either! As for his boss, I'd want to pinch his head at the neck and pump his carcass with helium so I could float him out the window (WOW! this film affected me more than I thought!)!    Darren Aronofsky does not do films that require no thought, and \\"The Wrestler\\" does not disappoint here, either. How much is fake and how much is real? Well, you get your answer.  That Rourke was made for this film is unequivocal. Some have said \\"The Wrestler\\" has a docu-drama feel, and they're right, but it doesn't take ANYTHING away from what is presented on-screen. In fact, if it didn't possess that feel, I don't believe it would have been as good as it is.    Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood play the two women in Randy's life, and he just can't seem to make things jell with the two of them. He has the best of intentions, but as they say, sometimes, even that is not enough. What comes across here are people who have been stunted in their growth as human beings. For whatever reasons, they just can't make that leap that would allow them to join the human race. Wood plays conflicted emotion VERY well!    For the few bucks I paid for this film, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. Then again, with Rourke pounding on the hood, and Aronofsky driving, why wouldn't there be?!
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Back in 1991, Barbra Streisand released a four-disc CD set, [[ASIN:B00009VU2M Just for the Record...]], chronicling her first thirty years in show business through rare audio clips, album tracks, recording outtakes, and periodically her bona fide hits. There was talk of a video version that never came to pass, which makes this a particularly fitting consolation prize - especially since now nearly two additional decades have elapsed.<br /><br />This three-disc DVD set captures Streisand at three points in her storied career. Disc One contains the Ft. Lauderdale stop in her mega-successful Fall 2006 tour, which was as much a commemoration of her nearly half-century career as it was a cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre for her renowned liberal causes via her foundation. Disc Two has her last stop in Anaheim during her much-heralded 1994 concert tour - her first in 27 years, while Disc Three documents the recording sessions behind her acclaimed 1985 back-to-her-roots CD, [[ASIN:B00005V3XG The Broadway Album]]. This last one starts with a fast-cut montage of her early-to-mid-career TV and film performances, which lends a nice bookend to her astounding five decades of performing.<br /><br />The centerpiece is the beautifully photographed 2006 concert (*****). I was fortunate to be present at the San Jose stop two weeks later in her tour, and at an impossibly youthful 64, Streisand looked resplendent as proven on this disc. Granted her lower register has developed a burnished throatiness and some of her more precocious high notes escape her now, but the lustrous glow of her voice is still very much in evidence. The melisma and dramatic conviction remain unparalleled, as she remains a willful force of nature based on a most singular persona, and easily the most accomplished song stylist of her generation. This disc represents a wonderful remembrance of that evening, as well as a pristine document of a beautifully turned performance for those who missed it.<br /><br />The event is not the therapeutic exercise in self-introspection like Streisand's previous comebacks. Given how many more audience reaction shots are included here, she is far more relaxed with her stage patter and with her political conscience on relatively limited display. Played by a 58-piece orchestra, the opening is a rousing rendition of the Broadway overture from [[ASIN:B000002SNJ Funny Girl]], which leads to Streisand's enthusiastically greeted entrance as she sonorously sings her long-ago stand-by, \\"Starting Here, Starting Now\\". She makes a comically studied attempt at the piano to re-introduce us to her first composition, the very Gallic-flavored \\"Ma Premiere Chanson\\" (which in hindsight, sounds very much like \\"Lost Inside of You\\" from [[ASIN:B00005V3XL A Star Is Born]]).<br /><br />Many of her fan favorites were expected and are accounted for here by necessity - \\"People\\", \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\", \\"The Way We Were\\", \\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\\" - with the arrangements almost the same as the recorded versions but with her immaculate professionalism still making them sound fresh. There is a decidedly sentimental \\"Funny Girl\\" medley in which she sings the title song and \\"My Man\\" from the film version, as well as the torchy ballad, \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\\", from the Broadway version. The second disc contains welcome additions to her repertoire - Maury Yeston's wistful \\"Unusual Way\\" from the musical [[ASIN:B0000996FQ Nine]]; Harold Arlen's WWII-era chestnut, \\"My Shining Hour\\"; and a galloping take on Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"A Cockeyed Optimist\\" from [[ASIN:B00000DHSL South Pacific]] combined fittingly with an excerpt from William Saroyan's \\"The Time of Your Life\\".<br /><br />Songs from her early performing years are sprinkled throughout - a smoky nightclub version of \\"Down With Love\\", the poignantly evocative \\"(Have I Stayed) Too Long at the Fair?\\" appropriately twirling her chair when she mentioned the merry-go-around, and of course, her signaturesong, the slow-tempo version of \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\". The unsubtle bombast of the stentorian popera group, Il Divo, has been thankfully toned down from the CD on three ensemble tracks, but their scripted patter still comes across as contrived. A nice surprise, however, is the Q&A session where she takes questions on cards submitted by the audience, answers them with her trademark wit and chutzpah, and even sings a truncated version of \\"Stoney End\\". The concert ends appropriately with her touching rendition of Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile\\" with a guest appearance by her much-beloved dog Sammie.<br /><br />There are five bonus performance tracks - a wonderful throwback to Streisand's Bon Soir days with a touching rendition of \\"Nobody's Heart (Belongs to Me)\\" leading to a rousing \\"When the Sun Comes Out\\"; then a condensed version of \\"The Woman in the Moon\\" from \\"A Star Is Born\\" in tribute to House Speaker-elect Nancy Pelosi and Senator Barbara Boxer both in attendance at the final stop in Los Angeles; and two entirely skippable tracks from Il Divo (ah, the beauty of track selection on DVD). A behind-the-scenes featurette is also included consisting of interviews with long-time collaborators like her rarely seen manager, Marty Erlichman; and finally a description of the Streisand Foundation as provided by executive director Marge Tabankin, who speaks glowingly of Streisand's philanthropy.<br /><br />The second disc (*****) is an archive of her classically appointed 1994 concert tour which feels as much like a performance piece as it does a concert - especially with the insertion of film clips, a mock-duet with Marlon Brando from \\"Guys and Dolls\\", and three therapy sessions. Those who already own the previously released DVD, [[ASIN:B0001MDQ30 Barbra Streisand - The Concert Live at the MGM Grand]], which documents her first show of the mini-tour, will not find too many surprises here. Most of the changes occur in the second half with both the Linda Richman/Mike Myers comedy routine and the Disney song selection cut in favor of a [[ASIN:B0000025Y1 Yentl]] medley. Looking elegant on her Jefferson-inspired set, she performs impeccably, although I have to admit in hindsight that I prefer the more relaxed Streisand I see in the later concert.<br /><br />The third disc (****1/2) is a fascinating making-of featurette which really shows Streisand's mastery in the recording studio as well as some of her perfectionism. It's enthralling to see her with the likes of Stephen Sondheim, whose songs she interprets with emotional acuity on \\"The Broadway Album\\". The interview with director William Friedkin is pretty interesting considering the promotional nature of the piece. As a bonus feature, there is an archival performance included from each of her [[ASIN:B000B9PW7G first five TV specials]] (1965-73) for good measure. The entire package provides an impressive retrospective for a performer who has long ago moved into show business mythology.Here Again\\".

0240810961|5.0|[[VIDEOID:34104231]]Drawn to Life is a collection of lectures from long-time Disney animator Walt Stanchfield. He has worked for Disney since the 1950s.<br /><br />There are two volumes, each with over 400 pages. The reason for two volumes is probably to make the books easier to handle. Both are on gesture and life drawing, even though the cover art might suggest otherwise, especially the one with the lion. You can start reading from any book and any lecture. The order isn't important.<br /><br />There are plenty of essays in the books. Each is a lesson relating to drawing and animation. It can be tangent drawings, creating believable characters, learning to observe, understanding gestures, etc. There are tips on almost anything relating to drawing. Loose and sketchy sketches serves as examples to the lessons.<br /><br />These books are more thinking than drawing technique books. For example, the lessons are not about how to draw perspective, the lessons are about how to use perspective. You can view sample pages for volume one and volume two on amazon.com to get an idea.<br /><br />The books represent a tremendous wealth of information and insight into drawing, animation and observation. After all, Walt Stanchfield has more than 50 years of experience in animation.<br /><br />This book is recommended to those who are into animation and drawing.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

1401207529|5.0|Completing his visualization of the alpha (year one) and omega (dark knight returns) of the caped crusader's career, miller's delicate and thoughtful rendition of batman manages to blend the innocence and simplicity of the 1960s character colored by the context of all we've learned about him in the decades since. If you have a place in your heart for batman, and nostalgia for a rememberance perhaps not quite accurate, but nonetheless valid and real, year one will nurture those memories like chicken soup.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna's 2008 album \\"Hard Candy\\" was a welcome return from the pop icon.  Instead of dance-floor grooves like her last two albums she wandered into urban-pop territory.  Madonna can probably be the only woman 50 or older who can get away with the lyrics \\"If someone wants to pimp your style...\\"  Pimp our style she may, but \\"Hard Candy\\" will find the listener being addicted to the track.  Before you know the album will end and you'll want to put your favorites on repeat!  This is better than Mariah Carey's 2008 album because it is less trying to be \\"trendy\\" and more from the heart.  Sure she may have worked with trendy producers like Timbaland and The Neptunes, but they also break out of their shell for a more original sound.  Highlights include the opener \\"Candy Shop\\" and the Timberlake-written/produced \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You.\\"  While it may only take \\"4 Minutes\\" to save the world, it will be a little longer before you finish enjoying the album.
0385338732|1.0|Interesting plot idea, but poorly executed.    (SPOILER)          I hoped that her first fall had triggered a personality change which explained the life she woke up to, and the fact that all her old friends hated her.    But instead we were given a very weak reason why she became a total jerk to friends that she had had for years.    None of the characters evoked any liking, empathy or sympathy (not unlike her horrid shopaholic series)

0767836324|5.0|I love the ironic points in the movie whereby Peter Pan has become his feared nemesis. A pirate who overwhelms weak businesses.  A grownup with absolutely no sense of humor.     I can feel for him, having long left childhood behind, and this movie reminds  me to take those times with the not-so-lost children in my life (my kids) to giggle and be silly, rather than rule-mongering all the time so to keep order.    I enjoy Hook's reaction to seeing Peter for the first time - all bloated and fearful.   And then 3 days hence - his response to seeing him again. Beautiful.    And I love when Peter refers to Hook as \\"Old man\\" only to have Hook use that name on him later on during the fight because then you realize it - both of them are \\"old men\\" from the perspective of the lost boys and Peter's kids.    The only thing I didn't like was Julie Roberts as Tink. I don't particularly like her acting style and she came across as VERY flat in this movie.  Her odd attempt at 'romancing' him when he had forgotten who he was disturbing on a few levels... 1) His kids would die if he didn't go save them  2) His personality had reverted to that of a child.

Only suggestion would be to order more since shipping practically doubled the price of the triggers (and for such a tiny product, they came in a comparitively huge box (and almost entirely empty aside from the packing material).
B000MV90IU|1.0|Better view than the DVD. But only worth renting, or if it can be purchased used or on mark down at $5 or less.<br /><br />A great film with very problematic picture and sound quality on Blu-Ray. The source transfer for \\"Bullit\\" has obviously not been re-done for Blu-Ray, and appears to be the same source transfer used for the older DVD edition of this film. Although the superior medium and capabilities of a 1080p Blu-Ray disc make this an upgraded way to view this material, the limitations of an aging source transfer abound and call attention to themselves. Detail is OK in well lit scenes, much less so on indirectly lit surfaces and shadows. Blacks are unstable and milky, and there is motion judder and blur of in motion detail in shadows. Skin tone and texture show the waxy effect of DNR (digital noise reduction). Surface detail is mediocre at best. Sharpening is obvious and annoying. All in all a better view than the DVD version. But only worth renting, or if it can be purchased used or on mark down at $5 or less.
B001UXJQHE|5.0|Of all the Andre Rieu performances that I have witnessed, going back many years on VHS through the world-wide productions on DVD, this show he gave in Australia is superlative to extremes.  I have no doubt that some will say this is not the classical Rieu, and therefore not so great, but on this occasion, he successfully presented a show that could satisfy all tastes, from those of the \\"general\\" public to those of the \\"exclusive\\"  musical genre.  And that is what real entertainment is all about. I don't think maestro Rieu will beat it, but I'm quite happy to live with all his successes culminating in his great triumph in Melbourne.
0553582445|4.0|When considering the Tawny Man series as a whole, it is an excellent conclusion to the story begun in the Farseer trilogy. However, the Farseer trilogy was the better written half of the story.     The Tawny Man series suffers from a lot of laborious reminiscing and build-up. The pacing of each book is not the best, and you'll find large stretches where the story plods and you find yourself wishing you could skip ahead to the end.     The strength of the Tawny Man story is that it finishes the story of characters you have come to know and love. You find yourself caring enough that you make it through the slow parts and come to a very satisfying conclusion.
B000002UAU|1.0|I agree with that kid. This album is oarful. The Beatles were probably the most mainstream band ever created, and when they were tired of bubblegum pop, they tried to be all trippy when they were given acid by that awful muscian, Bob Dylan. But the only thing they could accomplish is ripping off that song from the Wonder Years, making a bad cover of William Shatner's classic, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, and overall making an album that is barely listenable unless you take some LSD. Plus the title is tl;dr and there are no music videos for MTV.<br /><br />For good bubblegum pop, get the Jonas Brothers.

0061438294|5.0|Joe Navarro, a former FBI agent, shares his insight into the world of body language.  In this book he outlines different \\"tells\\" that can tell you whether someone is feeling nervous or relaxed.  The prime message of this book is to observe what a person's base behavior is like and then to look for changes in those behaviors as you interact with them.  I've found this to be much more useful than other body language books because he teaches you not only what to look for but also how to look for it.    I recommend this to anyone who is working directly with people.  This could be anyone from sales people to HR managers.  You could even apply the things you learn in this book to non-work related situations such as parenting or even playing poker.  If you want the best body language book on the market, then this is it.

With simple economic principles in mind, how can anyone watching this film be convinced of his message?<br /><br />There are many signs of a broken health care system in our country, but there has to be better documentaries or books that provide more facts than this stupid \\"documentary.\\"  Moore states many \\"facts\\" and statistics without citing his sources.  He comes to silly conclusions based on no evidence.  When watching this film, I can't help but wonder how much of his information is made up and how much information on this issue is left out.  The entire movie is made up of him talking to dozens of individuals about how health care is free in other countries but not in America.  Its an emotional film and makes you feel for those in trouble but still doesn't explain just WHY its free in other countries and not here.  Anyone in the right mind knows that nothing is free and you get what you pay for.  Just because someone NEEDS medical assistance doesn't mean that it can be magically available.  This leads me to believe that this film portrays the need for an alternate reality that doesn't exist.<br /><br />If you want to watch a film that successfully investigates the health care system of America, this is not it.  This doesn't even meet the definition of a documentary.  Its just liberal propaganda that supports the illusion of free health care.  I wouldn't even recommend this film for a good laugh.  There is no point in watching it!  If you want to join Moore in his journey to an alternate universe where stuff is free simply because Michael Moore says it should be, than this is just the film for you.  It surprises me how many people and critics gave this movie good ratings.his movie good ratings.
1416594884|4.0|I am always amused by the number of reviewers who feel they must provide their own synopsis of a novel. What we want to know here is whether this is this the hypnotic, intriguing LeCarre that drew us into his world years ago, the world where fully imagined scenarios were descriptively etched into our imaginations, where the characters were also fully fleshed out? Or, is this a LeCarre novel like the Mission Song that left us (certainly myself) just numb?  This book is a worthy read for any LeCarre fan. The Hamburg locale and characters are well described, the characters fleshed out - it's always fun to imagine what actors would play the roles in any LeCarre book (Bob Hoskins for the German operative Bachman anyone?). The moral intrigue of the plot is quite relevant to today as are the somewhat amusing musical chairs being played by the international intelligence agencies as they vie to create relevant indentities for themselves in the modern post-9/11 world. Anyone who has spent any time working on anything with the US Department of Homeland Security is familiar with this situation. Many, many disparate components that were previously independent are now under one umbrella and they are all trying to stake out their own turf.    So, all in all a good read. Yet, the moral decisions facing the characters remain too much the same from too many other LeCarre books and thus only 4 stars. Believability is getting a bit stretched as we meet 2 more characters that are willing to throw their lives and everything they have built away for one brief shot at what they believe is redmeption for a misspent life. Do we really believe Anabel is that naive? An older man in a lost marriage's lust for the young beautiful idealistic liberal is a common theme in many novels. But Brue's willingness to toss it all away seems rather too simple, especially since he seems to know it's a lost cause.    But I did enjoy the fact that Issa remains largely a secret throughout the book. It would have been easy for any other novelist to expose his true character, yet LeCarre leaves that open. The ending however is too abrupt and I agree with the others.    Enjoy. As a lifelong fan who scours print and online waiting for word on every next novel, this one was an enjoyable, absorbing read.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I was head over heels with a-ha in the 1980s and never got over them.  The lyrics, the voices...it all seemed and still does that their songs speak to the heartl  Then a few years ago I found the new stuff that North America never seemed to receive.  This is an amazing album...start to finish.  Morten holds a note for over 20 second in \\"Summer Moved On\\"  talk about award winning.  My favorite group has been and always will be a-ha! Morten, Pal and Magne...come back to North America...PLEASE!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, I really like this workout. There are three workout levels, each 20 minutes long. I've done level 1 a few times and tried level 2 once, and I just love how challenging they are. I'm not ready for level 3 yet, I'm sure. It feels like there isn't a wasted moment, and it really gets me huffing and puffing and sweaty. I like that it incorporates weights to add strength to my arm/shoulder muscles. There's nothing fancy here, and the moves are pretty intuitive. Oftentimes, I hop on the elliptical machine afterwords to keep the sweat going for another 20 minutes or so.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I heard everyone say that they thought it was a dud...well I had to see for myself because this is the music of my childhood.  I LOVED IT!  You might say it is campy, but who cares when it just seems to make a dull winter day seem bright again.  It may sound like a chick flick, but so what!  I enjoyed it and my boys loved to sing and dance with me.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Not since the days of Seinfeld and Arrested Development have I laughed this hard and long over a sitcom.  The Big Bang Theory is a spectacularly written show and the chemistry between the characters is absolutely hilarious.  I was so happy to hear that it had been signed for 2 more seasons.  I cannot get enough.

0553381687|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire has quickly become one of my favorite series.  This first installment is a grand start.  The characters are well-developed and the plot is full of twists and turns.  One of the things I like most about Martin's tale is that there is not a definitive \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" guy.  We are left to choose our favorite characters based on their actions.  I have re-read the first 4 books 3 times and find myself sympathizing with different characters each time.  A literary delight.
B000002JPA|1.0|I am a huge fan of progresive rock if you're talking late 60s, early 70s with bands like Yes, Genesis, Van Der Graaf Generator, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, ELP and Gentle Giant but this stuff is just embarrasing.  I wasn't real familiar with later progresive rock meaning, late 80s, and I knew some people who liked Dream Theater so I decided to give them a try.  I got their first 3 albums and I listened to them and listened to them and listened to them til I realized I couldn't stand them.  These guys are so ridiculous.  It seems that since they are sucj excellent musicians they focus way too much time on showing off on their instruments.  And some of their changes in the music make absolutley no sense.  Their is endless soloing, and playing guitar, bass, keybaords or drums faster just to show off how technicaly good they are.  This is the same reason why I hate Yngvie Malsteem.  This is supposed to be Dream Theater's best album but it just sounds like a bunch of endless noodling and metal riffs to me.  I just can't get into this band or see whats so great about them.  The first album, When Dream And Day Unite, sounds like a cheesy hair band album.  As for me being a prog rock conasuer I'll just stick to the classics that I listed above.  For bands like Dream Theater and Porcupine Tree to me is technical garbage.
B0012QCZ54|3.0|My opinion was that this movie was definitely better than the first. The dance scenes were awesome!!!!!!!!!! The story line was ok but if you are thinking of buying this than it should be just to see the dance scenes.
0061122416|5.0|For the dreamers, the creatives, the brilliant, the unrecognized. I lift my glass to the little voice inside of all of us. I lift my glass higher to those who listen. This book is for them. Conformation that accepted belief is not always for everyone. Beautifully and simply written from the soul. If I am not mistaken, the author, as a young man, was committed to an institution by his father. One day, perhaps, we will not lock up what we don't understand. This book is meant to free our hearts and souls. It does... just listen. Bravo!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I love this movie, got it for a couple dollars and it was in excellent condition.
B000060MWU|4.0|You can't always know what the other guy's thinking, but this seems to be the pivot point upon which David Lynch crafts his essentially noir tale of fractured identity and broken dreams.    Bill Pullman figures prominently in this film as a sax player who, through a particular psychological breakdown finds himself inside another man's world, feeling his feelings, and thinking his thoughts, many of which are of violent actions approaching murder.    To attempt any reductive rationale for the Lynchian style is to do a great injustice to both the director and viewer, since part of the dynamic of the film is based on our own perception of reality and how it is visualized in the film.    Watch the movie with glee, and a decent helping of sugar- it's a wild ride down a lost highway.
B001U0HBPQ|2.0|Hollywood seems to be undergoing a midlife crisis. Indeed the box office seems to be yearning for the day gone by with 'recent' pictures such as 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', 'The Poseidon Adventure', and the upcoming montage of horror flicks including the new 'Friday the 13th'.  The recent Christmas season brought us another Hollywood 'remake' titled \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" which is loosely based on a very intriguing short story by the great F. Scott Fitzgerald. Now for those of you folks that are still eager to see this you may want stop reading now!! Last Warning!!  At the risk of sounding like that pretentious friend that we all have (let's call him Howie) that says \\"Oh the book is so much better!\\", I have to agree with Howie.   The Premise of the story is that a man is born old and ages backward until he passes as an infant. The movie is set at turn of the century in New Orleans where Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is deserted by his father onto the steps of a nursing home with a small wad of cash. Benjamin undergoes all the hardship that may be expected of a young man in his eighties. He naturally has a difficult time relating to 'youngsters' his age. He falls in love with a young girl 6 years his junior (he appeared of course to be much, much older than she). He falls out of love with her, ends up in Europe, and decides to have an affair with the wife of an English diplomat. After a while he goes back to New Orleans looking much younger still and rekindles the love of his youth (enter Cate Blanchet). The movie goes on at a slow and very predictable pace until Benjamin dies as a baby with a keen sense that he has been there before. The film tries to make us sympathise with Benjamin but I felt nothing but complete indifference. The directors try to tug -nay yank at our emotions, but all I felt was boredom.   I've also heard certain 'gushy' critics compare Benjamin Button to Forrest Gump. What is it that we loved about Forrest? We didn't love him for his handicap. We loved him because he overcame his handicap to achieve amazing feats and did so without a touch of malice.   A much better version of \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\" is Mr. Fitzgerald's. The story is hardly recognizable and much more comedic with a touch of whimsy.
B0007KTAU4|4.0|I have never heard of Carla Bruni before but stumbled upon her music throguh Amazon while looking for a good Edith Piaf collection. I purchased this on a whim and I'm not disappointed at all! This is beautifuly relaxing music, her voice is soothing and sexy. My only complaint? The songs tend to get a bit redundent sounding by the end of the album, this makes great dinner music or background, relaxation music.
B001DJ69E8|5.0|OK, I've collected soundtrack scores for years and never realized trailer music is what I should have been searching for.  I've actually purchased soundtrack scores thinking the trailer music was from the movie and then been disappointed.  I'm a writer and use music to inspire and this album, hands down, is the best I've ever heard.  If you are not moved and inspired listening to this album then you need to check for a pulse!
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|Good deal for a good movie.
0446677450|5.0|This is an easy read that was recommended by a friend. The book tells about a child that was influenced by two men, one of which was his father. Even though the book discusses financial issues, it is not complicated to understand. In fact, the underlying message is simply how to think rich. In other words, it tells you how to think like rich people think and act like rich people act. I highly recommend this book for everyone.
1574241451|5.0|Anyone who has ever owned and/or played a Gibson ES-335 guitar needs to read the history of this famous instrument. Packed with facts and photos, it traces the heritage of argueably the best and most popular guitar ever produced by Gibson.
B000005H7D|4.0|Though a lot older jazz has lost  resonance for me, Blue Train is reminder of the purity of standard structure in the hands of such a brilliant soloist and budding leader, taking what is apathetically mundane nowadays and stamping it with brass immortality.
B001HN69AE|3.0|When I first heard several years ago they were going to be doing a movie based on my favorite Anime Series of all time I had high hopes.  Sadly the more info released those hopes fell.   But I decided to go see it any way to help make sales so maybe they will do another film and it will be better.  Turned out there were some good moments in the movie, I had my fair share of geeking out. But they messed up so many things in which makes the series great that it was hard to give it a good view.    I will say I ejoyed the martial arts and such. But it was definantly flawed.  A few decent actors, dumb story line and some of it was just down right silly.  But I encourage you to see it and pick up the disk. But dont expect alot.
B0000028RR|4.0|Rarely had a group debuted, in singles-form no less, with a more potent attack than the last track of their most powerfully raw output, making radio radical if just for a moment. The group might have refined a few songwriting techniques in future releases but never sounded as urgent again, only pulling away from what their moniker and manifesto originally ordained.
1843560267|5.0|This lexicon has been a great asset to me in my third semester of collegiate Greek. Please notice the headline, however: \\"For the Study of Classical Greek and Bible Study.\\" Liddell and Scott's is not for beginning students; a simpler dictionary, like the [[ASIN:0198605129 Pocket Oxford Classical Greek Dictionary]], would better suit them.
B000002IZ4|4.0|Although Core had been consistent enough, STP only came into their own with the follow up, which has a little more fun by adding a little more psychedelics, a little less straightforward power chord crunch, and a lot of subtly effective songwriting enhancements to produce what is rightfully referred to as their best.
B001TODCII|5.0|This movie is a must have for any action dvd collection, but i see it's still rated PG 13. I was hoping for an extended R or un-rated directors cut of this movie.. :-(
B000002I4S|4.0|Up to that point, Coltrane's first for Atlantic began what many consider his definitive reign as accessibly edgy bandleader, providing the launching point for his first true artistic streak which merged his formalized writings with a cultivated soloing which needed to expand outward ever since.
B00003CXB4|2.0|My personal opinion I would not order anything from groundhigher. I ordered the movie, The Lion King for my 7 yr. old grandson. I was told I would recieve it by 4/21/09..Well it is now 5/04/09 and I have not received it as yet..I have sent one email to that person and no response..I just sent another one tonite. Doubt if I get a response on that one either..Very disappointed and I was gonna rate this a one but it came up 2 stars and not even worth that.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|I remember buying the CD when it came out- and seeing him live twice on the We Live Here tour at the Beacon in NYC.  All I kept thinking is that he is a musical genius- technically and creatively.  Each song is great on its own- all stars in an all star lineup.  Everytime I fly, as we approach landing I HAVE to be listening to TO THE END OF THE WORLD- the perfect song as the place is descending- even if the attendants tell you to shut off all electronic devices.  Overall- a great album from PM's experimental period of modern rhythyms, latin/Brazilian, and other electronic experimentation.  One of my all time DIDs.
B000002NFM|4.0|This is a good CD. Some of the songs are somewhat repetitious, but each has its own little complexities when listened to carefully. Volume needs to be turned up a little to hear all the idiosyncrosies. I good buy!
B0018QQQKS|3.0|You certainly learn a lot about financial innovations that have helped economies around the world grow and improved the lot of mankind from this book.  It does, however, get off topic and talk a lot about the DESCENT of money and the spectacular bubbles and calamities that have befallen us in the past.  In short, the book could be about half the size it is, and you can get better information about bubbles, manias and frauds from reading the book \\"Devil Take the Hindmost,\\" by Chancellor Edward.
B001QB9H10|3.0|The movie was very intertaining, yet, it has become somewhat of a repetativeness. They want to kill him and drives around alot. There wasn't much car chasing, more of a story line. Not worth to see in the theaters, yet, if you collect sequels, its a good addition as a DVD.
B001TH16DS|5.0|The picture quality is absolutely amazing - you really have to see it to believe how good it is.  I was a bit worried about the enhanced effects I heard they were doing - I really thought it might alter the \\"feel\\" of the show.  I couldnt have been more wrong!  They really knew what they were doing here.  They enhanced some of the effects and re-did some of them [like shots of the Enterprise] using CGI instead of models to make it look more \\"real\\" and more in line with what we're used to today - BUT they did it totally in line with the look and feel of the original show.  Watching this I really thought THIS is what Gene Roddenberry would have done, if he could have.  This is really the way Gene intended the show to be seen.    I can't imagine anyone who wouldnt be happy with this - as for the price - well, this kind of upgrade doesnt come cheap - but I thought - if you are a ST fan - it's well worth the money.  I cant wait for the second season to come out.

0553385461|4.0|Having just finished the book, I can definitely recommend it. If you're at all interested in the state of modern science, it's an excellent primer on the topic. My only (minor) complaint is that there are parts of the book that appear to leave out appropriate depth for the sake of brevity. Keeping the book short is good, but there were a few times when I found myself really wanting more in-depth information but it wasn't there. But that's really a minor point for an otherwise excellent book.<br /><br />Be warned, though. While the book may seem deceptively short, it's not the type of thing you're going to burn through in an afternoon. (Well, unless you're a physicist, in which case you wouldn't be reading this book in the first place.) There were a number of sections in the book, particularly in the later chapters on quantum theory, where I found myself reading, and re-reading, and re-reading, and thinking about, and re-reading again the same page to try and figure out what he's talking about. I'm sure that the subject matter is presented in the simplest way possible, but some of these topics are real mind-benders. This is, in my opinion, a very good thing though. :)
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I know this film was reviewed as predictable but sometimes you just want to escape and this is the perfect film for that...everyone is pretty, the locales are just perfect and everyone finds lasting happiness in 2 hours (the length of the movie) or 2 weeks (the length of time in the movie).  I was entertained and hope you will be also.

B001232NG8|5.0|I've loved this album since the day I first experienced it as a teen in the early 90s. I gleefully bought the Perception boxed-set, only to be disappointed by an engineering contradiction. Sure, the studio albums were put through a long-deserved remastering process, but there was one thing always bothered me. In the linear notes to the self-titled debut album, it states that the album was actually released on LP at the wrong speed. It was intended to be a couple of steps faster, since this is the way the songs were recorded & performed in concert. They say that the original radio-played versions of the singles were in the correct speed. There was an error in the LP mastering process with the tape machines that cause the tempo & pitch to slightly slow down. Ultimately, this is the same pressing that would find it's way to cassette ,& eventually CD. The linear notes state that the \\"newly remastered\\" Perception boxed-set release was supposed to correct this. When I ripped it out of it's jewel case & first listened to it, to my surprise, I heard no difference in the tempo. While I did appreciate the clarity & remittance of originally censored tidbits, I was let down by the fact that they still neglected to fix the speed issue. If you compare the track clock times, they are the same, if not a second or two longer that the previous CD version that was released in the 80s. When I recently noticed these new 40th anniversary re-mixed & \\"advanced resolution\\" tracks on Amazon & other download sites, I felt a little skeptical. To my surprise, I discovered that they finally got it right! Correct speed, & I really dig the even cleaner re-mix over the previously released re-masters! No elements of this classic recording are muddy or distorted anymore. PERFECTION!!! This is the way the album was originally intended to be heard form the start! It only took 40 years!
B000G6R7B8|4.0|This is an excellent product from Seiko.  Pros:  1) Legible dial where numbers are clearly laid out in WWII bomber format.  2) Luminous markers hold light well  3) Automatic, may not be as accurate as a quartz watch but one can certainly appreciate the continuous sweep of the second hand and the exhibition display.  4) Nato Style nylon strap is comfortable and does its job, although i have plans to replace it with a calfskin brown strap as i am suspecting some threading to occur within 3 to 4 months time.  5) DAY and DATE, often see one or the other but makes the watch much more useful with both of them.    Cons: NONE    Im enjoying this watch and might plan to start a collection.
0385474547|5.0|An insight into traditional Ibo life written by an Ibo.

B001RIY4WE|4.0|I have the ULTIMATE edition of T2 in DVD and I adore it, I really hope the next BluRay edition is at least this good.<br />I've been reading BluRay reviews since the first BluRays came out, I can't help but noticing that complains about transfers, lack of extras and poor quality Blu Rays always come from the very same source; FOX.<br />Examples: DieHard, Predator, The hunt for the red october, Commando and now T2<br />I think there should be some pressure from retailers like Amazon to make FOX put a little more effort in packing quality material into BluRays. Otherwise, what's the point of investing money in BluRays?

0061186473|5.0|Any story collection of the incomparable Neil Gaiman that contains the short story \\"Chivalry\\" ought to be given 5 stars! Every time I read words that Gaiman has written I am in awe and overcome with jealousy that I never thought of this or that incredible idea! As a child, my favorite stories were the legends of King Arthur, and the story \\"Chivalry\\" was not yet around for my enjoyment! How I would have loved to have this collection - as well as his recent Newbery winner, \\"The Graveyard Book\\" as a young, avid reader, who obsessively read Ray Bradbury and Edgar Allan Poe over and over again and couldn't find anything on the same level of quality and bone-chilling enjoyment. Even though many of these are being republished here, it is a great introduction for young adults to the crazy, chilling, creative, vivid world of Neil Gaiman. I find these stories to be perfectly acceptable - and amazing - stories for the young, precocious reader. Neil is perfection.
B001UDYI9K|5.0|I've always loved Eric's vocals and always wondered how come he didn't sing all the songs in the APP albums.  This CD reminds me of all the good times I had while listening to those Alan Parsons Project vynils. My two favorite songs are The Golden Key and Immortal. But the rest are wonderful too! Thanks Eric for sharing your talent. I don't want to wait 20 more years for your next project. You know, time is flowing like a river...
0374139563|1.0|The book is thin, poorly-sourced, and much too breezy to support such a bold menu of policy prescriptions.  There is little new here for anyone familiar with William Easterly's books, except a stronger push for reliance on international capital markets.  I am actually prone to agree with many of her suggestions, but both her critique of a straw-man model of aid and her support for why her ideas might work are much too cursory to be taken very seriously.  Also, although not her fault because of when the book was written, one certainly would question her faith in international capital markets given the massive failure of the banking system in the U.S. and Europe.  I'll be selling mine back as a Used copy.
1400049628|2.0|I had really high hopes for this book. I understand that it is meant to be comical. There are a few laughs in it but honestly the writers style is rather dull and gets old very quick into the book. Maybe this isn't suppose to be read straight through sort of like the SAS survival handbook. That book was very boring trying to read straight through but better to just open up and read.  I do like how the guy has some stories made up for zombie events, but he refers to \\"this incident only happened once\\" or \\"this technique has only been successful once before\\". This became very repetitive. He keeps referring to incidences that are completely made up and it just makes it sound so unrealistic. Now I understand the book is not meant to be taken literally, but if you are going to write a book and make it sound so serious that it's amusing at least don't over-due it by trying to use references every other paragraph.  Another thing is the weapons defense part of the book. I really don't think this guy did more than wikipedia or google different types of weapons. My first argument is the part about blades. He writes that the trench spike is the ultimate weapon. Really? A foot long spike? Better hope your aim is always dead on and that you can maneuver in order to land a blow to the temple and hope you aren't bitten in the process.  He also really underrated a shotgun. The versatility of a shotgun would make it the first weapon I would grab. He writes that shotguns are great for close combat and uses slugs for longer range but why not just use a rifle? Because when zombies actually reach you you're screwed. Slugs can be shot upwards for 100 yard AND expand on impact insuring the there is nothing left of a brain. Carrying a .22 won't do you much good if most of your bullets go straight through the skull. Not to mention the reload time on a rifle (more common ones) will get you killed. Shotguns are just a more economical and versatile choice to me.  It may sound like I have just read to far into all of this but it is for a reason. Honestly it just seems like this guy had an idea and wanted to throw a book together and make money. The subjects that can actually be backed up with information seems to be lacking. It would have been better if it were more real, hard survival knowledge relating to a zombie outbreak and less history of zombies and \\"reported\\" cases.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|This is a beautiful performance, both visually and musically. What a rare treat as Loreena has few perfomances that can be attended. It is also a great value as the DVD is accompanied by 2 CDs of the music. Even the packaging is beautiful. It arrived in less than a week.

0930289528|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much...especially since I hadn't seen or read anything about it. It was amazing.    The book is excellent. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the movie. One must keep in mind the dated-ness of the book (it takes place in a dystopian UK circa 1997), but it is an enjoyable read.
0596009208|4.0|This product is pretty good; however, it's content to length ratio is a little low. You have to read a whole lot to get much, and that's a slight nuisance.    Still, it seems to be one of the best books out there for learning Java, and I'm glad I bought it, and I would suggest it to others who are learning Java.
B001SKB1Y0|1.0|A totally plot-less and pointless movie with shallow characters and ridiculous dialogue.  I rented this to watch with my wife because we love Woody Allen and she loves romantic comedies, but this film was a complete disappointment.  This was nothing more than a tedious \\"art film\\" lacking the art.  It was neither sexy or poignant or sensitive or even fun.    When the movie ended we just looked at each other and said \\"what the hell was that?\\".    One of the worst movies we've seen in many years.

And, surprisingly, even though Peirce can't sing, he did great...thank goodness for those machines they have to make him sound better! haha! Loved it! My daughter watched it 3 or 4 times.
031606792X|5.0|My Twilight Experience - I had heard about the book series, how stores selling Twilight merchandise had met their earnings, but I thought it was a tween book thing.  One night my Wife suggested we watch Twilight on pay-per-view.  I said fine since I had my laptop in front of me I could always get some surfing in.  Well let's just say that in the first 5 minutes, my laptop was closed and I was fully engaged in the movie.  The next day I went and purchased the first book.  In the next couple days I had read the first three books. Before starting the fourth book, Breaking Dawn, I had gone to Amazon and saw some \\"One Star\\" Reviews became a little bummed out and almost didn't want to read it. So I started Breaking Dawn which was a little sad since I had become so wrapped up in these characters I knew that my time with them was limited. After finishing the book I'm SO GLAD I read it.  You learn so much more about these characters, their actions, motivations, and ultimately how they fit together.  Many shocking revelations, suspense, and a nicely tied together ending.  I truly want to thank Stephanie for writing such a wonderful series!

B001PA0FFO|3.0|I'm going to avoid using the obvious puns here (ala `no doubt about it' or `don't doubt it' or really anything with the word `doubt' in it) and just say this as blunt and straightforward as I can.<br /><br />I really expected a lot out of `Doubt', and while it managed to hit the right tone on a few occasions the end result was very uneven.<br /><br />Taking the helm in directing his own stage play for the big screen, John Patrick Shanley had a lot to live up to.  His play was very well received and so getting it onto the big screen was going to be difficult.  You have to be careful not to do your already adored work an injustice.  Getting the goddess known as Meryl Streep and the impressive Philip Seymour Hoffman to sign on to do your film is a step in the right direction.  Filter in `it' girl Amy Adams and veteran supporting player Viola Davis (the type of actress you recognize for her face, not her name) was also a blessing.<br /><br />But, can a writer actually direct his play on the big screen with the right amount restraint and power to make it enjoyable?<br /><br />I am in the minority here when I say that John Patrick Shanley's direction is probably the best thing about this movie; aside from Viola Davis.  Honestly, he really nailed it for me, and all the deemed clich&eacute; tricks he incorporated (ala the burnt out light bulbs and storm sequences) actually elevated the mood for me and really captured the essence of what `Doubt' was all about.  I even thought that his direction was slightly better than his writing.  The screenplay is powerful indeed, and the moral imposed on us is brilliantly developed; but I must admit that adapting a stage play holds varied obstacles; mainly dialog.  A play is very `dialog' reliant, while a film does not have to be such.  Some stage/screen adaptations remain dialog heavy because the story requires it (ala `Long Day's Journey into Night') but for the most part, if done right, the dialog can be trimmed and the surroundings can be used to emote what mere words cannot really convey.  I feel that Shanley's effort to transfer his play was only partially successful in that regard.  There are sequences that are almost boring because the words are not backed up by the needed emotion.  This could be a problem lying mainly in the actors themselves, but I feel that in some instances the dialog could have been trimmed to leave room for the actors to act with more than just their mouths.<br /><br />Take Viola Davis for instance, an actress who has a mere eight minutes or so of screen time and really only a mouthful of words to say and yet she manages to capture every ounce of this woman's state of affairs and dances circles around Streep.<br /><br />Aside from Davis the acting gets a little more hit-or-miss for me.  Amy Adams is serviceable yet nothing spectacular at all.  She hits the right emotional confusion in her final scenes, but it isn't anything truly noteworthy.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good in some scenes, and by that I mean VERY good.  In others though, he almost disappears into the background.  It's not that his performances is bad, because it's not, it's just that he lacks his usual strength in some scenes.  Streep was a surprise to me.  I had heard a lot said about how campy her performance was, but I didn't believe it.  Honestly, it's not wholly campy as much as it is just uneven.  She doesn't seem to have a complete handle on her character, and that's not something I've ever seen out of Streep.  Some scenes she's nearly flawless and yet in others it was almost as if a completely different actress was doing the role; and then to get walked all over like she was by all of her co-stars (Davis stomps all over her, Hoffman dominates her in their final confrontation scene and even Adams steals her thunder in the scenes finale).<br /><br />This is not `prime' Streep.<br /><br />The films subject of faith and morality, of suspicion and pride, of maliciousness and ethics is delicately handled and for the most part effective.  When the film ends the viewer is left with the same feeling of `doubt' Sister Aloysius is left with, so the film is effective.  It's just not as effective as it could have been had all of the elements come together as I expected they would.  I know that this is a raved film that landed on quite a few top ten lists and managed five Oscar nominations, but I'd only give it one (Davis in UNDENIABLE) and leave it at that.  I'd recommend it, sure, for it is not entirely without merit but I would not label it a masterpiece or even a `must see' film at all.he viewer is left with the same feeling of `doubt' Sister Aloysius is left with, so the film is effective.

630542828X|5.0|A voice explains the worth of a person in tort law. A young child is worth the least, a white middle-aged professional is worth the most. A Massachusetts hospital is being sued, the lawyers agree to a settlement after the jury is selected. [Does this match your experience?] Personal injury lawyers are the sole defense against a corporation for the average citizen. The small town of Woburn lost a dozen young children to leukemia. They blame contaminated drinking water, but that may be difficult to prove. Will Jan Schlichtman take this case? It takes a lot of money to bring a case to trial. Fate brings Schlichtman to that industrial site where waste is dumped into the river. The need for a lunch hour is explained (to promote sanity in a hectic environment).    The judge seems biased against personal injury lawyers. Rule 11 is old and ambiguous. Discovery goes on to learn about waster disposal from the industries. One witness knows something. \\"Did you ever eat peanut butter?\\" Silicone and TCE are spilled on leather for waterproofing; where does the waste go? The costs for doctors and geologists are high. They must borrow money from a bank for expenses. One employee tells more to Jan. Another man tells what they did: just dumped it in the ground. Most cases are settled not tried. Jan gives his price for a settlement. Too high?    The trial begins. A civil suit is over money for suffering and damage. The witnesses testify. A phone call brings Jan to the judge's chambers. If they can't prove the chemicals reached the wells there is no case. The jury must decide three questions. Jerry talks about Truth and a Court of Law. Will Jan settle for $20 million? Or less? What is the trial about? Money or Justice? There is a settlement. After costs and fees there is $375,000 per family. Will that site be cleaned?    Jan remembers about spilling that glass of water. Somebody had to clean it up, and there will be records. How could a fire ignite water? Jan would file an appeal, the odds are against it. But he can't afford it so he sends the records to the EPA (they have the resources). The result was the closure of the factories in Woburn. Jan filed for bankruptcy. What happened? After paying off debts Jan took on a similar case in Toms River NJ.

B001TH16DI|3.0|I got an advance copy of this and the first thing I noticed is that ONLY \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\" has been re-mastered in Hi Definition!<br /><br />BEWARE: The other movies are NOT new Hi Definition transfers! Digital Noise Reduction was used to reduce the grain. So why buy Blu-Ray copies of old Hi-Def transfers made for DVD releases? You are only going to buy them again when Paramount re-masters them in new transfers!<br /><br />Some customers may not notice this cheap-out when buying this set. The BIG lettering on the back says \\"DIGITALLY REMASTERED WITH BRILLIANT PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY\\", but if you look closer you will see the small print says \\"The films have been digitally remastered and The Wrath of Khan has been fully restored in high definition picture quality and 7.1 Dolby TrueHD.\\"<br /><br />****CLARIFICATION****<br />Some fans are confused by my review. Let me first say that I am a television engineer, not a novice Blu-Ray owner.  So I want to list some clear facts to help all understand what this set is.<br /><br />1) Are all of these movies 1080p High Definition video presentations?  YES<br />2) Do all of these movies have 7.1 Dolby TrueHD Audio?  YES<br />3) Will all of these movies look better than the older releases?  YES<br /><br />What is the difference?<br />Paramount returned to \\"Khan\\"'s original film negatives to make new high definition transfers and restore the movie.  All of the other movies are the 2001 transfers, digitally enhances using DNR technology was the only attempt at restoration.  This is a form of DIGITAL REMASTERING IN HIGH DEFINITION.  And this is the term that confuses the average Blu-Ray collector.  90 percent of the time when a studio claims \\"digitally remastered\\" on a DVD or Blu-Ray Disc they do NOT mean they went back to the original film negatives to make a new transfer, they just used digital technology to clean up the old transfer.<br /><br />So why the complaint?<br />Because we all believe that Paramount will re-release these again, newly \\"Restored\\" from the original negatives.  If you do not believe that, look back at Paramount's track history of Star Trek releases.hese again, newly \\"Restored\\" from the original negatives.

1440468397|4.0|I started reading this novel years ago, when I was reading all of Jane Austen, and I didn't finish it. It was too tense and agonizing.  The suspense was almost painful:  here is this young woman in her late twenties, still in love with a man she rejected because of family pressure eight years ago, and he comes back into her life.  At first he seems cold and distant, but then she begins to think that maybe he still loves her too.  But in this society, the woman can't speak first. She can't simply say to him, \\"I still love you, and I'm sorry I didn't accept your proposal eight years ago.  I was given bad advice by my family.\\"  No, she has to wait for him to put aside his pride and ask if maybe she's changed her mind about him.  She's on pins and needles the whole time, and there are terrible humiliations, and she's treated very badly by her family, but in the end it all works out.    Still, it's so painful to think that women once lived like this: utterly dependent on marriage for survival; dreading being an old maid; prevented from doing any kind of real work at all; prisoners of a rigid class system; and silenced by rigid gender role conventions.

B001U0HBQ0|5.0|When you watch a film and for several hours, taken away from reality, watching an adventure and almost like a roller coaster, emotional high until that one last dip where you know that the life of Benjamin Button is a film that is not only heartwarming and heartbreaking, but yet you come away feeling that you have just finished watching an epic, brilliant film.<br /><br />Since 1988, the producers of `The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON' have been trying to get this film made.  First in the hands of Steven Spielberg, the director became too busy with \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\" that the script was passed on to a variety of writers, directors including Ron Howard and Spike Jonze and talents that were up for the part such as Tom Cruise.  It took almost 20 years to get this film made but fortunately, everything came together when David Fincher (\\"Zodiac\\", \\"Panic room\\", \\"Fight Club\\", \\"Se7en\\", \\"Alien 3') took on the director's helm for this film.<br /><br />With a unique screenplay by Eric Roth (\\"Ali\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\", etc.) and Robin Swicord (\\"Practical Magic\\", \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", etc.) and the casting of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, these names behind the the 2008 film would prove to be magic, not only in box office sales but also to be nominated for 13 Academy Awards (winner of \\"Best Achievement in Art Direction, \\"Best Achievement in Makeup\\" and \\"Best Achievement in Visual Effects\\") and grossing over $329 million worldwide.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />When it comes to \\"THE CRITERION COLLECTION\\" releases, I have not been disappointed.  The company prides itself in releasing a film with the original director's intention.  Also, making sure that their releases are quality releases.<br /><br />For \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\", there were a few segments shot on 35m film but the majority of the film was created in the digital realm, without ever being output to a film element and transferred.  The film was shot on the Viper FilmStream and Sony F23 Digital cameras and color corrected by Jan Yarbrough on FilmLight's Baselight system.  This High Definition master was converted directly from the Digital Intermediate color space to SMPTE Rec.  709 24 frames-per-seond at 1080p.<br /><br />The video quality is absolutely gorgeous.  Blacks are black.  No signs of scratches, dirt or artifacts.  Having been shot on digital video, \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\" sports magnificent video and just a variety of colors.  You can see the details in every scene and this is just a film that sports stellar picture quality.<br /><br />As for audio, the original theatrical sound mix was optimized by sound engineer Ron Klyce for home-video listening.  The audio is featured in DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless.  Although the film is primarily a dialogue film, everything from the rain and wind (recreating Hurricane Katrina) to the sound of the boat on sea, the crickets, the sounds of Louisianna and hearing the jazz music in the French quarters, the machine guns and tracer rounds during World War II, every channel on your home theater is utilized.  Of course, this is not an action film  but nevertheless, the film sports crystal clear audio and for scenes that utilize background sounds to the action scenes, you're getting the best audio presentation.<br /><br />So, both picture and audio quality are magnificent.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />Now, this is where \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\" continues to shine.  I don't think I have seen the filmmaking process covered so much in detail than what is presented on this Blu-ray disc and because of that, this is one of the best releases in terms of special features that showcase the filmmaking process.<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />Audio commentary featuring Academy Award-nominated David Fincher -  David Fincher is one of those director's that is very detailed on the filmmaking process.  For those who love to hear about the direction and what one wanted to accomplish, thisis where you find out the details on what is behind-the-mind of this director.  David Fincher's commentary was great!  The pacing was good and he kept delivering with details and what he wanted to accomplish.  Very well-done commentary!<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />The second disc features the bulk of the features and this disc is packed!<br /><br />  * The Curious Birth of Benjamin Button - This segment allows you to watch a near 3-hour feature of the making of the film but I highly recommend viewing them separately because there are segments that are separate from the \\"Play All\\" feature.  I will have to say that this is the most detailed special feature I have seen on Blu-ray that covers the filmmaking process.  Each feature is quite lengthy, informative and anyone wanting to get into film or appreciate the filmmaking process is going to love this segment.  Here is what is included:<br /><br />- THE FIRST TRIMESTER<br /><br />  * Preface - (3:08) Director David Fincher discusses his involvement of the film and discussing how the death of his father and the emotions that he had, came to play in directing this film.<br />  * Development & Pre-Production - (28:56) Kathleen Kennedy (Producer) and Josh Donen (Former Executive at Universal) discuss how they have been trying to get this film made since 1988.  How it landed in the hands of Frank Oz to Steven Spielberg, to Ron Howard and then Spike Jonze and rewrite after rewrite and nearly two decades later, having David Fincher directing the film.  Very informative details on the pre-production phase.<br />  * Tech Scouts - (12:21) This segment features the various scouting locations for this film.  \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\" features so many locations and so many time periods, that this was going to be a challenge for the film and crew.  But everything worked out (especially in post-production) in making these locations come alive for the characters.<br />  * Storyboard Gallery - Storyboards of the locations<br />  * Art Direction Gallery - Gallery on the art direction of the film.<br /><br />- SECOND TRIMESTER<br /><br />  * Production Part 1 - (26:09) This featurette includes the casting process and interviews with the cast and behind-the-scenes making of the film.<br />  * Production Part 2 - (29:03) This featurette features interviews with Donald Graham Burt (Production Deisgner) and the creation of external parts of the homes to make things look authentic of that time period, creation of the tug boat to the silicone casts.  As well as creating a feel of winter with ice and snow during the month of May and everyone interacting with the director.<br />  * Costume Design - (7:38) Interview with Jacqueline West (Costume Designer) of recreating the various genres and using actual photos from that time period and the script as a way to come up with ideas.<br />  * Costume Gallery - Gallery of costumes for the film.<br /><br />- THIRD TRIMESTER<br /><br />  * Visual Effects: Performance Capture - (7:41) Interviews with Editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall.  Assembly of the sound and how they interacted with the Director of what worked and what didn't work.<br />  * Visual Effects: Benjamin - (16:55) One of my favorite features on how they did the face replacements.  Interviews with Eric Barba (Visual Effects Supervisor) and the various production meetings they had in getting things right.  Interview with Paul Lambert and Janelle Crenshaw, Compositing Supervisors of Digital Domain.  How they would capture Brad's face, use of silicone masks and how one wanted to quit because what the filmmakers wanted didn't seem possible.  But they managed to make it happen.  Building of a new system to capture the face of the talents and using tracking and High Dynamic Range technology.<br />  * Visual Effects: Youthenization - (6:21) Featuring interviews with Greg Strause, Visual Effects Supervisor for Hydrauls and Edson Williams, Visual Effects Supervisor at Lola and how they would makethe talents look younger using digital facelifts and cosmetic enhancements.  Working with a plastic surgeon who helped make things right with his comments and utilizing software to make the the talent look years younger.<br />  * Visual Effects: The Chelsea - (8:48) Interviews with Nathan McGuiness (Visual Effects Supervisor of Asylum) and Jascon Shugardt (Additional Visual Effects Supervisor of Asylum) who were responsible for the tug boat scenes.  Creating the water and backdrop and make things look real, especially during World War II and everything that relates to the tug boat, the Chelsea.<br />  * Visual Effects: The Simulated World - (12:52) - Craig Barron (Visual Effects Supervisor of Matted World) - How they would make certain locations come alive and feel they are from that genre, such as old Louisianna, New York City and Russia.  Also, how Thomas Buttons home was created via CG and mimicing reality and simulating environments.  Their goal was to create a real world from the virtual world.  Also, to make certain scenes consistent with lighting and sunshine when in reality there were rain clouds or gray clouds, etc.<br />  * Sound Design (16:03) Skywalker Sound in Marin, County featuring an interview with Ran Klyce (Sound Designer) who wanted to capture everything from children playing outdoors, horses walking and utilizing those sounds for a period piece.  From capturing the sound of jazz music at the French Quarters and achieving the quiet dialogue that the Director wanted.  But the challenge was getting Benjamin's voice when he was younger and then using Cate Blanchett's voice for young Elle Fanning (who plays young Daisy).  Very informative and interesting commentary.<br />  * Desplats Instrumentarium - (14:52) Making the music for the film with the direction of David Fincher.  Alexandere Desplat behind the scenes at the studio and with an orchestra.<br /><br />- BIRTH<br /><br />  * The Premiere of the film at the New Orleans Benefit Screening to a live audience - (4:20) Director David Fincher and Brad Pitt talking to the audience.<br />  * Production Stills<br /><br />  * Trailers - The following segment features two theatrical trailers.  One with the duration of 1:44 and the other at 2:42.<br />  * Still Galleries - This segment features the storyboard, art direction, costumes, production stills<br />  * Subtitles<br /><br />Also, included in this release is a three page essay by Kent Jones (author of \\"Physical Evidence: Selected Film Criticism\\") about Director David Fincher and the film \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\" is a fantastic film!<br /><br />The pacing of the film takes its time and thus it is told in 165 minutes but it's the gradual ride of watching Benjamin's life unfold in our very eyes through the various decades.  To watch the people that touched his life and vice versa, but then once you get to the third leg of the film where he and Daisy are now around the same age and fall in love, you just anticipate how things will end.<br /><br />Screenwriter Eric Roth knows how to captivate the audience.  He manages to slowly pace things in a format that many may compare to another film which he wrote, \\"Forrest Gump\\" but is anything but.  The acting of the talents are just amazingly well done and makes every scene come alive.  Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett are both magnificent in this film but the supporting actors, may it be Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abbot for her scene with Benjamin in Russia or Benjamin's mother Queenie played by Taraji P. Henson and even Jarrid Harri as Captain Mike, each of these characters contribute to this movie and have all brought something special.<br /><br />With the direction of David Fincher, screenplay by Eric Roth and the acting sequences to be tremendous, the film continues to marvel with its beautiful cinematography and what was created technically via visual effects.<br /><br />\\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\" has gone farther in technical achievement and pushing veterans in their field to do what was considered impossible.  Every scene featuring an elder Benjamin Button to the ballet dancing Daisy, were all other talents but with technology, the ability to take Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's face and mannerisms and digitally make things come together.  Everything looks realistic.  And nothing looks fake, the virtual world looks realistic.<br /><br />This crew had to capture the 1920's all the way up to the present and everything from scouting locations, visual effects, costume design, set design everything came together fluidly and looks so amazing!  And the fact that nearly everything was created digitally, the high definition transfer of the film was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Great care went to the visuals, the audio and the fact that this is part of the CRITERION COLLECTION, quality is what we got in all levels and I can't imagine why a cinemaphile would not like this Blu-ray.  It's absolutely reaches perfection on all three levels of picture and audio quality and special features.<br /><br />\\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON - THE CRITERION COLLECTION\\" reaches perfection on all levels for this Blu-ray release.  For fans of film and the creation of film, this is the type of release that one can just be happy with.  You definitely get your money's worth.<br /><br />Highly recommended!e to make the the talent look years younger.      * Visual Effects: The Chelsea - (8:48) Interviews with Nathan McGuiness (Visual Effects Supervisor of Asylum) and Jascon Shugardt (Additional Visual Effects Supervisor of Asylum) who were responsible for the tug boat scenes.  Creating the water and backdrop and make things look real, especially during World War II and everything that relates to the tug boat, the Chelsea.      * Visual Effects: The Simulated World - (12:52) - Craig Barron (Visual Effects Supervisor of Matted World) - How they would make certain locations come alive and feel they are from that genre, such as old Louisianna, New York City and Russia.  Also, how Thomas Buttons home was created via CG and mimicing reality and simulating environments.  Their goal was to create a real world from the virtual world.  Also, to make certain scenes consistent with lighting and sunshine when in reality there were rain clouds or gray clouds, etc.      * Sound Design (16:03) Skywalker Sound in Marin, County featuring an interview with Ran Klyce (Sound Designer) who wanted to capture everything from children playing outdoors, horses walking and utilizing those sounds for a period piece.  From capturing the sound of jazz music at the French Quarters and achieving the quiet dialogue that the Director wanted.  But the challenge was getting Benjamin's voice when he was younger and then using Cate Blanchett's voice for young Elle Fanning (who plays young Daisy).  Very informative and interesting commentary.      * Desplats Instrumentarium - (14:52) Making the music for the film with the direction of David Fincher.  Alexandere Desplat behind the scenes at the studio and with an orchestra.    - BIRTH        * The Premiere of the film at the New Orleans Benefit Screening to a live audience - (4:20) Director David Fincher and Brad Pitt talking to the audience.      * Production Stills        * Trailers - The following segment features two theatrical trailers.  One with the duration of 1:44 and the other at 2:42.      * Still Galleries - This segment features the storyboard, art direction, costumes, production stills      * Subtitles    Also, included in this release is a three page essay by Kent Jones (author of \\"Physical Evidence: Selected Film Criticism\\") about Director David Fincher and the film \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\".    JUDGMENT CALL:    \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\" is a fantastic film!    The pacing of the film takes its time and thus it is told in 165 minutes but it's the gradual ride of watching Benjamin's life unfold in our very eyes through the various decades.  To watch the people that touched his life and vice versa, but then once you get to the third leg of the film where he and Daisy are now around the same age and fall in love, you just anticipate how things will end.    Screenwriter Eric Roth knows how to captivate the audience.  He manages to slowly pace things in a format that many may compare to another film which he wrote, \\"Forrest Gump\\" but is anything but.  The acting of the talents are just amazingly well done and makes every scene come alive.  Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett are both magnificent in this film but the supporting actors, may it be Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abbot for her scene with Benjamin in Russia or Benjamin's mother Queenie played by Taraji P. Henson and even Jarrid Harri as Captain Mike, each of these characters contribute to this movie and have all brought something special.    With the direction of David Fincher, screenplay by Eric Roth and the acting sequences to be tremendous, the film continues to marvel with its beautiful cinematography and what was created technically via visual effects.    \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON\\" has gone farther in technical achievement and pushing veterans in their field to do what was considered impossible.  Every scene featuring an elder Benjamin Button to the ballet dancing Daisy, were all other talents but with technology, the ability to take Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's face and mannerisms and digitally make things come together.  Everything looks realistic.  And nothing looks fake, the virtual world looks realistic.    This crew had to capture the 1920's all the way up to the present and everything from scouting locations, visual effects, costume design, set design everything came together fluidly and looks so amazing!  And the fact that nearly everything was created digitally, the high definition transfer of the film was absolutely perfect.    Great care went to the visuals, the audio and the fact that this is part of the CRITERION COLLECTION, quality is what we got in all levels and I can't imagine why a cinemaphile would not like this Blu-ray.  It's absolutely reaches perfection on all three levels of picture and audio quality and special features.    \\"The Curious Case of BENJAMIN BUTTON - THE CRITERION COLLECTION\\" reaches perfection on all levels for this Blu-ray release.  For fans of film and the creation of film, this is the type of release that one can just be happy with.  You definitely get your money's worth.    Highly recommended!
1416550534|5.0|I noticed another review called this book \\"mesmerizing\\" and I agree.  I was drawn into the lives of the main characters from the first sentence and couldn't put it down until Grace revealed the truth at the end of the book.    I highly recommend it and can't wait to read her new book \\"Forgotten Garden.\\"
B001TNGOXY|3.0|\\"It Could Happen to You\\" was the surprise romantic comedy of the Summer of 1994 directed by Andrew Bergman (screenwriter for \\"The Freshman\\", \\"Fletch\\", \\"Striptease\\" and director of \\"Honeymoon in Vegas\\") and a screenplay by Jane Anderson (who has written for television series such as \\"The Facts of Life\\", \\"The Wonder Years\\" and most recently an episode of \\"Mad Men\\").<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />One thing that people may see is the Blu-ray disc cover with photos that looks quite grainy and aged.  Granted it was an artistic decision to use a water color style of filter to give a painted look but by no means should anyone judge the cover for the picture and audio quality of this High Definition transfer of \\"It Could Happen to You\\".<br /><br />The film is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1.  Although, the film does show a slight hint of age and the High Definition transfer does bring out the grain, you do get a bright and colorful look of New York City and overall, picture quality is well-done for a film that is 15-years-old compared to the original DVD.  Like many films that came out in the 90's, many on Blu-ray tend to have some softness or dullness and \\"It Could Happen to You\\" joins that group.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, \\"It Could Happen to You\\" is not a stellar transfer but its a very good transfer compared to the DVD.<br /><br />The audio quality is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 in English, French and Portuguese and in Spanish 5.1.  The film is primarily a dialogue driven film.  Definitely more front channel speaker usage and rarely a need for the rear speakers or subwoofer in this film.  Dialogue is heard clearly and I think that once in awhile, you do hear the sounds of New York and the ambiance but overall, audio quality is very good for a dialogue-driven film.<br /><br />Music also plays a big part in giving us that New York feel but also that romantic sense with Frank Sinatra's \\"Young at Heart\\" playing during a scene at the old Yankee Stadium and of course beautiful classics such as Billie Holiday's \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\", \\"Now It Can Be Told\\" and \\"Always\\" by Tony Bennett and more.<br /><br />Subtitles featured are in English, English SDH, Portuguese, Spanish and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are no special features included. The Blu-ray disc for \\"It Could Happen to You\\" is BD LIVE enabled.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"It Could Happen to You\\" is a romantic comedy that was in theaters in July 1994.  The screenplay fits the \\"fairytale\\" or \\"Happy Ever After\\" storylines that were popping up in the early 90's courtesy of films such as \\"Pretty Woman\\" and \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\".<br /><br />The film was an enjoyable romantic comedy that definitely had that Frank Capra style of being a \\"happily ever after\\" storyline.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda definitely were enjoyable to watch, while Rosie Perez's character really goes out of its way to make you really despise her.  With \\"Pretty Woman\\" about rags-to-riches, \\"It Could Happen to You\\" goes a different way of money changing things but its all about how one responds to it.  Charlie and Yvonne continue to want to live their simple lives, he as a cop and she as a waitress.  Both have extremely kind and caring hearts while Muriel wants the best in life...the expensive clothes, plastic surgery and whatever fame it could bring her.  A selfish attitude that helps drive the final wedge into her marriage with Charlie.<br /><br />With Andrew Bergman in the helm as director, some may have wondered if the film would have been dark since his previous film such as \\"The Freshman\\" and \\"Honeymoon in Vegas\\" were anywhere near happy as this film but overall, Bergman did a good job capturing that New York magic and the emotions of the characters.  While Jane Anderson did a good job in making sure the pacing was just right and giving us that \\"happily ever after\\", \\"feel good\\" type of film.  In other words, the Bergman, Anderson and the entire film play it safe and never gets complicated.<br /><br />Of course, the storyline of a police officer willing to share half his multi-million dollar winnings with a waitress may seem farfetched but according to snopes.com, a similar story really did happen for real in 1984 with NYPD officer Robert Cunningham and Sal's Pizzeria waitress Phyllis Penzo.<br /><br />It's the performances by all three talents that make this film so magical, believable and most of all enjoyable.  And I like how the film would showcase the New York atmosphere from the city skyline to Yankee stadium.<br /><br />Overall, \\"It Could Happen to You\\" is an enjoyable romantic comedy that even in 15-years-later, is given new life through it's new, beautiful Blu-ray transfer.  This is probably the best we will ever see this film get.<br /><br />If there was only one negative that I found with this release is the lack of any trailer, featurette, commentary or anything that would be considered a special feature.  You do get trailers for upcoming films but that's about it.<br /><br />All in all, \\"It Could Happen to You\\" is an enjoyable romantic comedy worth checking out!urse, the storyline of a police officer willing to share half his multi-million dollar winnings with a waitress may seem farfetched but according to snopes.com, a similar story really did happen for real in 1984 with NYPD officer Robert Cunningham and Sal's Pizzeria waitress Phyllis Penzo.

B000GBEWHA|5.0|\\"GREASE\\" is the most successful movie musical ever created.  The 1978 film was based on a musical by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey and eventually caught the attention in the early 70's of producer Allan Carr who purchase the rights to adapt the play into a film.<br /><br />With the popularity of \\"SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER\\" in 1977 which help boost the career of John Travolta, producer Robert Stigwood joined Allan Carr to create a film based on this play.  Tapping director Randal Kleiser who worked with Travolta in the popular 1976 TV film \\"The Boy and his Bubble\\", recruiting \\"GREASE\\" musical choreographer Patricia Birch and hiring Director of Photography Bill Butler (\\"Jaws\\", \\"Stripes\\" and \\"Rocky II & III\\", etc.), this team would create a film that would become a musical ingrained into American pop culture.<br /><br />Despite no respect in supporting the film by the major film studios, \\"GREASE\\" would become the second highest grossing film in 1978 behind \\"Superman\\" bringing in $96 million in the box office, the \\"GREASE\\" soundtrack would achieve #1 status around the world during its release and the film received many award nominations.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"GREASE\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition and I will tell you I was blown away by the picture quality.<br /><br />I've watched this film dozens of times, owned the VHS and both DVD versions and when I started watching the High Definition Blu-ray transfer, I was speechless.  The many colors featured in the film were quite vibrant.  This film is over 30-years-old and Paramount really did a great service in the transfer and remaster of this film.  Closeups, outdoor scenes, you name it, the film looks spectacular!<br /><br />I compared my 25th Anniversary DVD to this Blu-ray and just the opening sequence alone with the two at the beach, the colors are just absolutely stunning on Blu-ray.  I was literally in awe of how beautiful this film looked in High Definition.  The DVD video quality just doesn't compare to the Blu-ray disc and I was quite impressed!<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and also in French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish mono.  Since music is a big part of the film, it was important for me to test this Blu-ray out on my system.  Where the 1977 film \\"SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER\\" was just spectacular for its High Definition audio transfer, I was hoping to have an awesome lossless soundtrack for \\"GREASE\\".<br /><br />Somehow, in the beginning of the film, it seemed as if the audio coming from the center channel was a bit lower than my front speakers. So, dialogue seemed as if it was being overpowered by the music.  I've run a variety of tests and I did have to increase my center channel dB a little bit to compensate for the music coming louder but this may be due to my audio setup for my receiver.  But everything sounded well throughout the film after the adjustment.<br /><br />The dialogue was quite clear but the music really came alive and I did notice certain sounds utilizing my subwoofer during the car and music scenes.  But overall, the music does sound great and clear via Dolby TrueHD 5.1.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"GREASE\\" comes with a good number of special features.  Included on this Blu-ray disc are:<br /><br />* Commentary: Commentary by Director Randal Kleiser and choreographer Patricia Birch - This commentary is quite interesting as Kleiser talked more about the film side of \\"GREASE\\" while Patricia Birch talked about the choreography part of the film.

You learn about the challenge of filming the National Bandstand segment, the finale during 102 degree weather and how Olivia Newton-John had to have her tight clothing sewn on and more.<br />* Introduction by Randal Kleiser - A brief :24 second introduction to the special features.

And many more interesting tidbits on the making of the film.<br />* Additional Scenes: Deleted/Extended/Alternate Scenes with introduction by Randal Kleiser (intro :13 scenes 11:55 - TRT 12:08) - Randal Kleiser explains how footage was recently found in the Paramount vaults.

Both Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta performed live on stage singing a few of their classic songs that sung with each other.<br />* Grease Memories from John & Olivia - (3:23) Both talent at the DVD launch party and discussing how it was like working together and their memories of being on the film and their favorite scenes.<br />* The Moves Behind the Music - (8:14)  Interviews with Patricia Birch and the talent as they discuss how they learned the dance moves and how it important it was for Patricia to work with Director of Photography Bill Butler in capturing the choreography for film.<br />* Thunder Roadsters - (5:21) Interviews with George Barris (King of the Kistomers) and Michael Astamendi (Car Builder/Fabricator) and others in regards to making the cars for \\"GREASE\\".

But I have to be truthful and say how much I was in awe to see the brilliant camerawork but to see how the choreography and just literally everything look quite smooth on film.<br /><br />And surprisingly watching this again 30-years-later and as the Director and even producers have said in the featurette, they were able to pull things off today that probably wouldn't happen now.  Quite a bit of sexual lingo but overall, the lyrics of the songs to the mannerisms of the characters is what made things look genuine.<br /><br />It's interesting to read some of the critical reviews from people who did not grow up with the film but are more familiar with today's musicals and drawing comparisons to \\"High School Musical\\" and making the comment of how HSM utilized real teenagers for high school life and that \\"GREASE\\" utilized 20 to 30-something year olds to play teenagers.  I don't think any of us who watched it back then ever thought about the age being an issue for the film.  What we saw were popular talent at that time in a movie musical and the film became a success.  Even today, I have no reservations of the talents playing their roles.  They did a fantastic job!<br /><br />For me, John Travolta was the hottest star coming off with \\"Welcome Back, Kotter\\" and then doing \\"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\\" in 1977 and Olivia Newton-John was just one of the most beautiful female solo singers at the time.  Both had unique chemistry and the film was well-cast that I felt everything just went smoothly on the final cut.<br /><br />You really have to give a big applause to Allan Carr and Robert Stigwood for taking the chance of bringing a musical to film but making sure its adapted well for the screen.  Sure we see musicals now but during that time, there was no studio support.  And because the film was enjoyed by audiences, the film is definitely ingrained into America's pop culture.<br /><br />Also, I was just amazed through the featurettes and learning how the choreography was done.  Because there were so many people utilized in the dancing segments, Patricia Birchwood wanted to make things come alive but to alter a talent's own personal dance to make it look right on film.  And of course, Bill Butler, to capture what Birchwood wanted on film, the amount of cutting from scene to scene showing opposing points of view on a song like \\"Summer Nights\\" to the ending theme, it was indeed \\"electrifying\\"!<br /><br />Overall, this Blu-ray release of \\"GREASE\\" is just the definitive version to own. To watch this classic film in High Definition and to see the magnificent picture quality really brings out the vibrant colors of the film, the energy and beauty of the beach sunset to showcasing the life of youth of the late 50's.  The DolbyTrueHD 5.1 audio makes the music come alive and last, there are many special features included that will help people remember and celebrate such a wonderful movie musical.<br /><br />Again, this is the true definitive version of \\"GREASE\\" to own!  I was just stunned by how magnificent this film looked and how much clearer and alive the music sounded in High Definition.  I highly recommend this release!Both talent at the DVD launch party and discussing how it was like working together and their memories of being on the film and their favorite scenes.  * The Moves Behind the Music - (8:14)  Interviews with Patricia Birch and the talent as they discuss how they learned the dance moves and how it important it was for Patricia to work with Director of Photography Bill Butler in capturing the choreography for film.  * Thunder Roadsters - (5:21) Interviews with George Barris (King of the Kistomers) and Michael Astamendi (Car Builder/Fabricator) and others in regards to making the cars for \\"GREASE\\".

B0014XCMVM|5.0|I have watched Alanis evolve and develop her style since her commercial debut in the 1990s. This work that took years to produce, is perhaps her best. Is it commercially appealing? Of course! Does radio play this in the USA? No. This is really tragic because this platter is divine.    Citizen of the Planet is bold, driving, revolutionary and if it was 1996, a #1 hit! It remains hidden within this erratic collection of tunes that further illustrate Alanis' hectic emotions. She is a great poet of her time. Her natural talent is augmented by rich melodies, that make the listener think, and laugh out loud. Not As We is a heatbreaker, that one recalls her failed relationship. This is the rebirth of the torchsong. Yet fully liberated. In Praise of the Vulnerable Men is another radio friendly standard that few will get to hear. Perhaps I should move to Canada...
B001S86J1C|4.0|\\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" was definitely a major hit from 1986.  I can remember everyone from high school just in love with the film and many people praising the latest hit from Director (and also writer) John Hughes who has directed many of the top teen hits in the 80's such as \\"The Breakfast Club\\", \\"Pretty in Pink\\" and \\"Weird Science\\".<br /><br />Needless to say, a film in the 80's that was attached to John Hughes was considered as golden and sure enough, \\"FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF\\" was as successful as his previous teen films (the film grossed over $70 million in the box office) and the film is considered (and voted) by many fans as one of the top comedy films of all time.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF\\" is presented for the first time on Blu-ray and with a 1080p High Definition transfer.  The good news is that the picture quality is better than any previous release of the film. Colors are vibrant at times, but with the film nearly 25-years-old, for some reason I felt the video looked a bit soft.<br /><br />Certain scenes show sign of ages with a few spotting and again, video was looking a bit soft.  Having seen the two magnificently looking Paramount releases of \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and \\"GREASE\\" on Blu-ray which comes out on the same day as \\"FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF\\", those films are 30-years old and look incredible and definitely look gorgeous on Blu-ray.  But for \\"FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF\\", it was a good transfer, but not magnificent.<br /><br />You do see a variety of cool colors such as the parade segment or even when the three are at the swimming pool, there is very good vibrancy of colors and part of the positive about this film is that a good chunk of the film is  filmed outdoors.  If anything, this transfer does look way better than its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />As for audio, \\"FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF\\" is a John Hughes film, similar to his other big hits, music plays a big part of his films.  And thus you can hear Yello's \\"Oh, Yeah\\" and the Beatles \\"Twist and Shout\\" in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The film is strong on the dialogue side and thus, the true usage of surround sound and when the film does come alive is during the scenes that showcase the music.<br /><br />Also featured is French 2.0 Dolby Surround and Spanish mono.  Subtitles include English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF\\" on Blu-ray is based on the special \\"Bueller...Bueller...Edition\\" DVD release and features the following in standard definition:<br /><br />  * Getting the Class Together - The Cast of Ferris Bueller's Day Off - (27:45) Interviews with a few of the cast during the time the film was shot and also a few recent interviews as of 2005.  The casting directors selected Matthew Broderick because he was one of the top young stars of the time with films such as \\"War Games\\", Alan Ruck was supposed to be in the original \\"The Breakfast Club\\" but this time gave Ruck a chance in this film (which was turned down by Emilio Estevez).  Also, interesting tidbits such as the real life relationship between the two actors that play Ferris's parents.<br /><br />  * The Making of Ferris Bueller's Day Off - (15:29) We learn about the filming of \\"FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF\\" from the various scouting locations, finding the right car (Ferrari) and how they were going to have it crash out from a window and more.<br /><br />  * Who is Ferris Bueller? - (9:12) Interviews with Matthew Broderick and the mindset of Ferris Bueller and playing the role.<br /><br />  * The World According to Ben Stein - (10:49) Ben Stein is interviewed in the past and the present.

1423101472|5.0|This book had everything. I am always nervous when reading the last in a series because the author has a monumental chance to mess everything up. Riordin didn't. It was great. Had me on the edge of my seat. I stayed up for two hour after I had already been up for 24 hours just to finish. Couldn't put it down.
B001TH16DS|5.0|The trailer for the new Star Trek Movie alone would be reason to buy this set, it looks incredible. The added special efects to the old series add to the Hi Def look and do not detract from it at all. Most of these are improved planet views and an enhanched Enterprise. The sound is somewhat muted as far as the voices go, but the music is very good. If you enjoyed the original series you will be able to relive your youth again this time in Hi Def.    [...]
1400031001|5.0|Not one of the reviewers here mentions my motive for reading this book, the Nat Tate Hoax, famous and infamous in England, but apparently not so here.  Briefly: In the late 90s, Boyd published a journal much like this one - complete with index - by artist \\"Nat Tate\\", who features in this book as well. -  He's the character who paints out of devotion to his idol, Hart Crane, and dies much as he did.  -  There was nothing to indicate that the book was fiction.  Abetted by David Bowie (who was in on the hoax), a lavish reception was given and several of \\"Nat Tate's\\" paintings (actually Boyd's) were on display.  Several big names in the art world went on record as remembering the young man before his tragic end.  So, need I say that a bit of a smash-up ensued after the hoax was revealed?<br /><br />Anyway, I opened the pages expecting something rather hoaxical (Yes, it's a word.) about Mountstuart's journal.  And indeed there is.  Nat Tate - Boyd dreamed up the name by combining England's two most prominent art galleries: The Nation Gallery and The Tate. -  is in the index here as well as if he were an historical personage along with all the other prominent Twentieth Century greats Mountstuart chances across (from Waugh to Picasso etc.) and there are so many lacunae that one feels a bit jolted about, manipulated.<br /><br />But what is Boyd really trying to do here?  If his writing is hoaxical in nature here, then perhaps our lives are somewhat hoaxical.  For, make no mistake, Boyd is an extremely gifted writer, and Mountstuart's journals are quite persuasively crafted, as well as insightful.  He is also very droll in putting on display how quickly our cultural icons have changed in the past century.  In Mountstuart's New York journal, for instance, he is reunited with his son Lionel.  In his January 1, 1961 entry, he writes:<br /><br />\\"He thinks he's found his new band - the Cicadas, a folk group, a trio.  He wants to rename them the Dead Souls.  What, I said, after the Gogol novel?  What novel?  Gogol's great novel, one of the greatest ever written, Dead Souls.  You mean there's already a novel called Dead Souls? (Expletive deleted!)\\"<br /><br />But this recurrent drollness only gets one so far.  Where Boyd really hits home, where his art resonates with life is in moments where Mountstuart realises that he's been tricked or duped in some way, as when he finds out that his beloved wife has been having an affair for two years.  Mountstuart writes:<br /><br />\\"This is the knowledge that really burns - twists the gut.  Again and again you go back over that time, charting and logging the lies and duplicities that you missed; acknowledging and realizing that those moments of fun, of peace, of happiness, of sex, were feigned and fraudulent...\\"<br /><br />How many significant actions or words on your part, in your life, honest (for a moment) reader, have been at least partly feigned and have their share of fraudulence when viewed in hindsight?  Does your gut twist when thinking on them?  This is the question that this fluent, convincing work of fiction ultimately forces on one.vel?

0441013597|5.0|Everyone kept telling me for years to read this book.  I've always thought it to be deep science fiction so I held out.  I finally finished this book and I was flabbergasted at how good it is.  Excellent and exciting read.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Great album! this version of systematic chaos is incredible!!   the cd is in excellent conditions (new) and the shipments was as agreed!  I'm really happy!
B001TOD92C|2.0|This is an uneven film.  The editing is very choppy in parts and some of the writing is almost unbearably cliché and weak.  I really expected more from Mickey Rourke and the director, but was delighted by Marisa Tomei's nuanced performance.  In the end, it seemed like a big budget student film.
1582701709|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read.  Thank God I borrowed it from a friend and didn't spend a cent on this money-making plot.  Save yourself the money and the wasted time.  Here is the secret: whatever you think about will happen to you.  Think good things, get good things.  Think bad things get bad things.  The end.  The book has no structure, no real chapters, just weird paragraph after weird paragraph saying the same thing over and over.  Was there an editor involved?  It doesn't appear that there was.  It is completely incoherent.  Does anyone quoted have a college degree? It sure doesn't seem like it.      Law of Nature? What are you talking about?     The sad thing is that people are buying this book and the author has become rich.  Wait, maybe there is something to this \\"secret\\".  All she had to do was think \\"I will write the world's worst book and people will buy it and I will become rich\\" and it happened!
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Thank goodness this movie was set in gorgeous Barcelona and gave us something interesting to look at while suffering through this lame story (it has been too, too long since Allen has told a compelling one).  Penelope Cruz out-acted everyone else, stealing every scene she was in and dwarfing the usually wonderful Scarlett Johansson.  The best moment in the film was the expressions on Vicky and Cristina's faces as they left Spain.
6303011012|5.0|The Acropolis concert is a truly spectacular performance. Yanni's genius is on display as he teams with the Philharmonic Orchestra and the music is grand. Although not a recent event, this is a collectors item for all Yanni fans. You can also catch a glempse of Linda Evans (his girlfriend at the time). Although the VCR was good, I am also purchasing the DVD.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Just got my set this week. So far it's awesome and I'm looking forward to the other seasons coming out. The people who remastered these and those in the orchestra did a great job making this transition. Now please work on the movies so we can buy them in a remastered. I've already purchased them in dvd, I'll wait until you finish the rest. But worth the cost in my book. But then I didn't buy the series on dvd, just the movies. Now TNG that's a different story. Unfortunately most of them are on Laserdisc.
1423101472|4.0|As an adult (I'm 42) I have found this series quite entertaining, along with my son (now 11).  It might be a function of how I read the book, standing up while waiting to have it signed by the author at the release party, instead of more leisurely at home, but I thought it lacked (especially in the early going) some of the trademark fun of previous entries.  I was well over halfway in before it really began to feel like a Percy Jackson book.  Perhaps it was the near instantly dire quality of the situations the characters faced -- usually there is a lot more time for the reader to relax and enjoy the setups.    But in the end this is a pretty minor complaint.  The book is action-packed and full of the snarkiness we are used to seeing from Percy and his friends, despite the seriousness of the situation they face.  There are several \\"Woo-hoo!\\" moments as gods and demigods get a chance to particularly shine.  And it would take a cold heart indeed not to smile at the ending chapters.    I for one am looking forward to the next series from Mr. Riordan including one at Camp Half-Blood and another dealing with...the Egyptian gods!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana Krall's \\"Quiet Nights\\" CD is absolutely beautiful. Diana's very sensual voice comes through repeatedly along with the equally sensuous piano, bass and percussion accompaniment. Many of the tracks I have on other albums but Diana and her Group's interpretations on this album make it the pinnacle of this style of music in my collection obtained over more than 40 years. I'm eagerly awaiting the Music DVD entitled, \\"Live In Rio\\", due to be released in Australia later this month.    Greg DEW  ADELAIDE, South Australia.
B001GCUO1G|5.0|Like most people, my favorite X-Man was Wolverine. The guy doesn't know how he got his claws, can heal superfast, and he can cut people up with a little bit of Tarrantino's edge. For example: The jump lunge at the mansion, 2 soldier stab, and 2 soldier throw over shoulders, and retracting claws when lowering arms in X2. I don't know if I could understand Logan's whole story if I asked Stan Lee himself.<br /><br />As for the movie: I like it. I went to see it opening day at high noon and I was very pleased. I liked how they introduced Jimmy Logan as a feverish child and then a soldier in so many battles. I'm not gonna spoil anything but I was surprised a tiny bit as to how Logan lost his memory. And one more thing, don't leave when the credits start. There's a surprise addition.
B00000AFWW|5.0|To cut to the chase...this is a a very good album with a lot of hooks and is very upbeat.  Every song is listenable.  This and the Red Hot Chili Peppers' Californication are my two favorite albums from the 1998-1999 period.  I highly recommend it.  I still listen to it from time to time and originally purchased it shortly after it came out.
1416914307|5.0|It was Awesome. Very easy read!  Cant wait for the pre-quel to be released.
B000VI70WM|1.0|...But I'll say it anyway: WTF?? I'm hesitant to join the mass chorus of fans ready to dance on Duran Duran's grave with this obnoxious release, but come on, \\"Flicky Flicky Flicky\\"?  Say it, Seth Meyer:  Really?!?
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Really love this Bond movie, certainly one of the best. Craig is surprisingly great as Bond and Dench as M. Loved the action sequences, the script, and the sports car. It's great on blu-ray, video/audio quality - EXCELLENT !!!. Every Bond fans should own this movie. Highly recommend it. ENJOY !!!
B0017ANAZO|2.0|I saw the original film recently, of which this is a remake, and I have to say that it's way better than this, to the extent that I can't see why they bothered to make this. This version pays lip service to every issue contemporary women have to contend with, but the whole thing comes off as disengenuous. What it does portray is that every actress in this movie has had work done and it shows! The only person who distinguishes herself, acting wise and appearance wise (because she looks authentic) is Annette Benning. I can't remember a time when I've seen her in a film when she doesn't do a great job. This might be worth getting just to see her act. Overall, I wanted to like this but I was disappointed.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|One of the best movies ever made in my opinion. Great cast, script, & special effects. Really enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance as the JOKER. Very happy he won Best Supporting Actor, the movie should have been nominated for Best Picture, at least. A must own on blu-ray. The picture & sound will blow anyone away, it's EXCELLENT! A must have in everyone's blu-ray library, highly recommend it. Enjoy Folks!
B0000549B0|5.0|This is one of the best classic movies on the market today.  Everyone, no matter the age will fall in love with Harvey.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|The best KingKong movie ever made in my opinion, thanks to Peter Jackson. It's long but that did not bother me. Loved the casts (Black & Watts), and of course, the special effects, WOW! Love the scene when the King of the jungle fought the T-REX, that scene alone is worth the price of admission. Excellent on blu-ray, both video & audio, it's a treat to your senses. A great addition to your movie library. Highly recommend it. ENJOY!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|You have to see this if you are a new Dr. who fan or not. Its just plain great stuff for everyone to watch.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This movie started the summer with a BANG, one of my favorite all time comic book movie. Robert Downey, Jr. is great playing Ironman, didn't think he could pull it off. Great cast & special effects. It is a must have in everyone's blu-ray library. Video/Audio quality - EXCELLENT!!!, it will blow everyone's sight & hearing away. Highly recommend it. Enjoy Folks!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show is definitely one of the best on TV today. Nathan Fillion does a stellar job, adding his signature wit and snark into the series.
014241011X|5.0|I LOOOOOOOOVE this book.  It was very good.  There was a lot of magic.  There also was a lot of mice.  \\"Eeeeeek!\\" they would say.  I would say this would be my favorite book in the world.  I want everyone to read it.  Again, I LOVE THIS BOOK!
0385335997|2.0|I have to keep reading, because I started and have to know what happens.  Like the 2nd book, I will skip through pages. How many more to go?
014241039X|5.0|The Twits is a very funny book.  It's about a wife and a husband who are really mean.  But I can't say more because the rest is a spoiler.  It was really, really, really funny.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I like this version of Pride and Prejudice because it is so unlike the BBC version and also the book.    In a word, it's wilder.    Also earthier.    Lizzie is much more interesting as a fey gamin who loves to tease people--and this is exactly what Kiera Knightley supplies.  Her shock at Mr. Collins's proposal is palpable.    But the real revelation is Darcy.  Instead of the prig he usually seems, here he seems a smoldering, volcanic presence more like Mr. Rochester.    Also the setting is smashing--Romantic lush outdoor scenes, very untypical of Austen.    Also the earthiness is sublime.  Pigs cavort in the Bennets' house--reminding us WHY Mrs. B. is trying to marry her daughters off: the rigid class system that prevents them from owning land, and prevents them from working.
0743454537|3.0|The premise of this book - one sister dying of a terminal disease and the other a 'designer baby' donor - pretty much guarantees that there is no win-win happy ending. And I suppose it should come as no surprise to find that ALL the characters are messed up. I was hoping for some redemption for the characters at the end, but felt the ending was a bit rushed (like the author had already maxed out her page count) and too contrived in some ways.<br /><br />I've heard good things about Jodi Piccoult, and medical-related fiction is my favorite (not to mention, what I write!). But this book had two flaws: it was written from too many points of view (seven if you count the epilogue) and had too many flashbacks.<br /><br />I applaud Piccoult's willingness to delve into how one child's illness affects the whole family (not just the child with the disease). And I understand the need to create a sense of this family's life and relationship before this point in the story, but the multiple points of review result in characters that are not as authentic and developed as they could be. And the flashbacks from so many characters become just plain confusing.<br /><br />That said, when you find yourself empathizing with a character the way I did the mother (probably because I have young children of my own), you know it's a good book. The hospital scene when Kate is two and Sara says, \\"I learn from my own daughter that you don't have to be awake to cry\\" hit me like a ton of bricks.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were set too high, but based on the hype, I was expecting a bit more from this author. Still - I'll read more of Piccoult.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|The transfer to Blu ray is perfect. What an ideal movie to watch on blu ray
B0018LX9T4|4.0|If you enjoyed Sex, Lies & Videotape and the like, give Secretary a go. Even love finds a way with these two, messed up souls portrayed by Gyllenhaal and Spader. The subtleties of the performances are what get to me and under my skin, in a good way! The bond in which this unlikely pair forms is endearing and inspiring. The S&M angle, to me, is a lighthearted one, not necessarily to be taken seriously as it is more of a tool used to connect these two fragile souls. An honest reflection of overcoming one's demons.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I really liked this book.  I read Water for Elephants immediately before this one.  Both books had a similar structure: the story of the narrator in the present day at the end of his/her life juxtaposed with a life-altering story from their youth.    The House at Riverton is far superior to the other book.  I was hooked from the beginning and was not disappointed with the ending.
B001TODCII|5.0|As of May 6 2009 This is easily the best flick that came out in 2009.  I saw it four times in the theater, and each time it is riveting.  Liam Neeson is as brilliant as ever.  The pace, cinematography, writing and acting...all top notch.  This one is sure to go down in history like the other films associated with Luc Besson, The professional, and Fifth Element
0439023483|5.0|I loved sitting down to this book.  I knew very little about Hunger Games before purchasing but haven't regretted my order or reading time.  In a way, I think the less you know, the more you can enjoy the story.  It may have been aimed at a slightly younger crowd, but as a young adult reader I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Very easy reading.  A great transitional book if you're going from heavy to light material or vice versa because you get a little of everything.    I'll be purchasing the sequel!
B001PR0Y4Y|5.0|It is 1987, and James Brennan (Eisenberg) is a college graduate looking to get away to Europe for the summer before heading on to graduate school.  Things fall through not only for the summer plans, but for graduate school as well.  James gets a job at Adventureland, making minimum wage and running a game booth.  While there, he meets a wide variety of people, and becomes particularly close to Em (Stewart).  Their relationship is complicated, not the least of which is due to Em's relationship with handyman/rock star Mike Connell (Reynolds).  As the end of summer draws near, they must decide the paths their lives will take, and no option is the easy choice.<br /><br />\\"Adventureland\\" is a great movie.  Evoking nostalgia for the 1980's, and providing great character development, \\"Adventureland\\" succeeds in almost every way.  While funny, the movie is not a comedy, but rather the humor of everyday life.  The actors all make their characters real in their own way.  Acting-wise, the one minor quibble is that Eisenberg at times seems like he is channeling his inner Michael Cera.  \\"Adventureland\\" left me with a warm, fuzzy feeling, and is definitely worth giving a shot.  I highly recommend it.
B001GCUO1G|3.0|I came out of this one feeling pretty much flat. One issue I had was that the recitative in the beginning is somewhat rushed. If the intent was for the audience to feel a connection between Logan and Victor then the connection just didn't happen for me. Nor did the love story evoke much of a reaction for me. By the time Logan is standing over the body of his ol' lady, my feelings were neutral. And since these two elements inspire Logan's motivation for the rest of the movie, I had an equally vapid reaction as he went about bulldozing his way for some kind of closure.    As far as popcorn movies go, this one was alright. These days I consider that to be another mark in the win column for film going. Considering the rarity of memorable movies, and the abundance of awful one's that I fight to put out of my mind; I consider myself unscathed by a quickly digestible and forgettable flick.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|My husband is a therapist, and we both find this series highly compelling and fascinating to watch.  This is an extremely well done production, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD next year!
B000V5TV22|5.0|I previously purchased a cheap (about $10) GPS receiver from another site, what a mistake. Took 5+ minutes to get a fix, and it would loose the fix going under overpasses on the freeway. Thought I'd actually do some research and find a decent receiver this time. Bought the GlobalSat BU-353, and it's been great! Usually gets a fix from a cold start in less then a minute, and have even had it get a fix while the car's still in the garage! I've only had it loose a fix one time, but it was because I was going through a tunnel, even still, the receiver picked up the fix up on the other side in just a few seconds.    The only issue I've ever had with it is that the base is a bit too slippery (since I try to keep it on the dash) and under hard cornering or acceleration, it'll slide down the dashboard. The magnet on the base is really strong though, and if you were putting it on the roof, I don't think it'd have a problem holding on.
0765356147|5.0|I am a scifi/fantasy & military scifi fan. I need my stories to fit together. I don't need to have everything explained to believe and enjoy, just make it work. Sanderson does this. Too many of the new releases are very empty for me. I forget them sometimes as soon as I put them down. This guy is good.<br /><br />Very good series. Original and well written. I wanted to find out what happened to them.<br /><br />There were no pointless journeys killing a few things along the way to take up pages here. This fault is getting very common lately.  Condensed interesting story arc. A fresh lack of bizarre no vowel names to struggle over. Good world building.<br /><br />This last book of the trilogy has a few more parallel story lines running but works well and fits/needed for the story. The pace of the ending was clipping right along and the conclusion worked for me.<br /><br />I started to give this 4 stars (series a solid 5) but I realize I really liked it and the ending was right. After all it's his ending. That being said books 1 & 2 were better somehow. Maybe it's me lol. Not an issue though, these are good books.
0312360266|1.0|I picked up Marked while looking for a good vampire type series. I have recently read the Mercy Thompson series by Patricia Briggs, as well as the Twilight series, and thought that this one might be another great take on vampires.<br /><br />The book was amusing and I moved through it quickly, finding myself thinking about the characters and what happened next on a regular basis. However, there were a few things about the book that bothered me a good deal. One was the utter lack of writing style that the Casts had. The book came off as the inane chatter inside a quite vapid teenager's head. There were huge plot holes that screamed regularly at me from the side lines and distracted me from the story. And there was a very one sided feel to all the interactions between \\"Christians\\" and \\"Pagans\\", the book makes it clear that Pagans are feeling loving individuals and Christians are judging domineering psychopaths. There really is no other portrayal which is sad. There was also a distinct sexual feel to the book as well as minor swearing.<br /><br />Though there was much that distracted me from the actual story being told, it was a quick and amusing read and only took me a few hours to finish. The characters are cute and the story is amusing, but the book comes down to \\"very pretty drivel\\".
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|A new spin on a cop show, funny, smart and the cast has excellent chemistry!!! Definitely one of the best shows on tv!
B00005JKL8|2.0|The hero is a reckless fool, and the villians are all incompetent. This movie is somewhat entertaining, but is just not in any kind of reality.<br /><br />When he's being shot at hundreds of times, and goes through a minefield, he wouldn't have made it. It's called shrapnel.<br /><br />Even forgetting about shrapnel, the darn explosions hit him directly half a dozen times and he keeps running.<br /><br />Gene Hackman, and the jet plane scene were the highpoint. You might squeeze 2 1/2 stars out of me because I was atleast entertained. Not a keeper for my collection.
0312539517|4.0|I thought the story in general was well articulated.  It brings the readers through the life of George Mallory from birth to his schooling days and finally climbing experience and along the way there are interesting anecdotes that keep the pages turning.    I would say the book really picks up during the last couple of chapters where George Mallory starts his attempts of the summit. Although the truth remains a mystery till this day, Jeffery almost made you believe that it actually happened and I am glad to be part of that journey and in the process made a believer too.
0240810961|5.0|I know little of the personalities and figures involved behind the scenes in the animation world, but it is obvious that Mr. Stanchfield has had much influence throughtout the field.  Browsing through this book, it will remind you of many other drawing books on the market, probably because many of todays authors learned from Stanchfield.     The book is a series of short chapters, each drawn form the lectures of Stanchfield.  They don't seem to be ordered specifically for following chapter 1 to the end.  I have been soending a few moments each day randomly reading a chapter or two and applying what I learn to my work.      The lessons are of course, mostly about gesture and how to add life to drawings, but other themes come up as well, some of them show the author's understanding of the artist's psychology.    No matter how many other drawing books you have, I strongly reccomend this one.  Keep it on your desktop and pick it up whenever you have some spare time.
0061537934|5.0|This was a DEEPLY SATISFYING, yet fairly quick read.  Touching, funny, philosophical...I predict there will be a rash of future dog owners naming their dog \\"Enzo\\" after the wonderful narrator/protagonist dog in this book.  (I may be one of them myself!)  It is not necessary to know anything about or even care about car racing to appreciate this book.  Well written and structured with the super-short chapters I love.  I just finished reading it and I am all a-glow.  You will be, too!

B0013D8LOK|4.0|I first came across the story of Sweeney Todd several years ago when my wandering eyes fell across the 1982 Broadway production with George Hearn and Angela Lansbury.  I was absolutely floored by it.  :)  So when I heard that Tim Burton (oh, how I love your work) and Johnny Depp were getting together to remake it, I nearly fainted in joy.      Sadly, I was expecting them to out do the 1982 version I had loved for so long, but just didn't feel they had accomplished it.      On the other hand, I did enjoy the film and was surprised at Depp's singing ability despite his voice not carrying the desperation of George Hearn.  And I would like to salute Helena Bonham Carter for her excellent portrayal of Mrs. Lovett.
B000HWZ4A2|1.0|Wow, this movie was so, so very campy.  Too think that dialogue this bad actually exists is truly amazing.  It only makes you wonder what people ever saw in Ayn Rand in the first place.  I guess those were much simpler times.  I mean, compare the objectivism of Ayn Rand with a philosopher of today like Eckart Tolle.  It's like comparing black and white to color.  It is nice to know that we have evolved in our notions and beliefs over the past 60 years.  Now back to the movie.  Gary Cooper walks through this movie like he's a zombie.  Patricia Neal over acts as Dominic so badly it's painful.  The other characters are so over the top, omg. The music score by Max Steiner famous for Gone with the Wind is pretty good however.  The set design was also pretty cool to behold.  All in all, this is a very overrated movie.  I mean, even Rotten Tomatoes gave it I think an 82%.  I would have given it a 45% and most of that for the musical score, set design, and direction by King Vidor.  See it if you want some High Camp in your life and some real over the top melodrama of days gone by.  Otherwise, skip it and go rent Citizen Kane.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Ms. Krall has an abundance of talent, first as a jazz pianist and secondly as a vocalist.  But neither is on display here.  In a word, this CD is a mess.      What is the obsession with the string arrangements?  They are so syrupy with little harmonic content to speak of you instantly think \\"elevator music\\".  And that interminably breathy singing style of hers has got to stop.  On \\"Where or When\\" the pedal point string arrangement is really boring.  She should have done a trio/quartet format here with flashy harmonic chords, a strong voice, and some piano improvisation.  Whoever is advising her should be fired.    I'm thinking of returning this CD - its really that bad.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic make this show what it is. It may appear, on the surface, to be a procedural, cop drama but when you dig a bit deeper there is constant tension in each episode and a twist that you won't see coming until at least 3/4 into the show. What other show could boast surprising their viewer week after week with a truly original story and a twist ending that makes you question everything you just witnessed. It's a beautiful combination of storytelling and great acting.     The writing in Castle is top notch. Each story, no matter how similar, always ends up going into a completely different place. Each case brings out something new within each of the characters. Castle has a good life but he seems to be missing something. Beckett is damaged inside but can't show it because she needs to remain as the strong female figure. Only in a recent episode have we found out that she does have a vulnerable aspect to her. It makes for an amazing relationship between the two characters.     If you are tired of shows like CSI, Cold Case or Law & Order but are still interesting in watching a show with interesting crimes and even more interesting solutions then Castle is for you. If you enjoy your drama with a large slice of realistic and comedic banter, then Castle is for you. If you want smart television with good writing that doesn't have the word \\"Reality\\" in it, then Castle is the show for you. I highly recommend it. 5 out of 5 stars and as much hyperbole as I can muster.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|Playing for Change is something special. It is marked by the fusion of an incredibly diverse range of musical styles and artists into one coherent package. I never would have imagined that so many diverse instruments, musical styles, and voices could be put together to make music so beautiful.    The main strength of Playing for Change is the emphasis on the so-called street musicians and artists most people have never heard of. Sure, some of the artists are well-known within their genres (Bono, Keb' Mo', etc.), but the vast majority of the musicians on the album are not recognizable by most folks.    In fact, it's frustrating because some of the performers on the album are so compelling that I immediately wanted to buy their albums. The problem is that many of them do not have albums since they are street performers or virtual unknowns. For example, Grandpa Elliott, a Louisiana street musician, has to have one of the most inspiring voices I have ever heard. It was disappointing to find out that there are no readily available albums by this amazing talent.    The album is so good that it is ashamed there are only ten tracks. It would have been really nice to have more tracks, maybe perhaps a second disc of music. Yeah, that is probably greed on my part, but heck, this stuff is so good I want more.    The DVD that is included with the CD is a must-watch. Having a visual of the many performers and their instruments, in their native countries, definitely adds context and meaning to the music. Watching Rajhesh Vaidhya play the veena or seeing Clarence Bekker belting out his vocals enhances the overall listening experience. It was a great move to package the DVD with the CD.    Since receiving Playing for Change it has been playing virtually nonstop in my CD player. I literally cannot hear these songs enough. They illustrate that music is the ultimate universal language.
B001GCUO1G|3.0|Well, I thought I might, but as the credits rolled on the first official summer film of '09, I realized I really didn't.  The way the origin was set up or rather alluded to in the previous X-Men installments was far more interesting then this film's blow by blow of the specific events that created the Logan we all know and love.  Sure, I used to read X-Men comics as a middle schooler so I already knew how Wolverine became Wolverine, but I never realized how much  the mystery of Wolverine was more entertaining without the details until I saw this film.<br /><br />No plot synopsis...there's not much plot to this film anyway.<br /><br />The plot to this current Marvel film is very small and uninspired.  The majority of the film is made up of the relationships or rather the meloncholy melodrama Wolverine has with his half brother, his wife, and General Stryker.  The plot doesn't kick in until about the forty minute mark.  Honestly, once the plot wheels get greased and rolling the film becomes less and less involving.  Even the action sequences were ho-hum.  Which is surprising, because so much dark conflict is built into them they should have severe impact similar to that of The Dark Knight, but they just ring hollow and routine.  I really, for the life of me, can't pull a single memorable image from any of the pyrotechnics involved in this film's story.  Considering that where the majority of the budget goes on these films, that's not a good thing.<br /><br />The acting is all fine.  Liev Shrieber brings an adequetely menacing presence as Wolverine's half brother Victor.  How we're supposed to believe that this well-spoken and sadistic maniac turns into the lumbering oaf that was Sabertooth in X-Men part one maybe the next film's major mystery.  Ryan Reynolds shows up briefly to play the character of Wade.  It's so brief that when he(or rather a stuntman under heavy prosthetics) returns in the finale you have to take a few seconds to realise it's him, or at least listen very closely to some dubbed dialogue to further drive the point home.  Which is another problem.  The whole film sets up this major conflict between Logan and Victor and then drops it in favor of a mega showdown with Deadpool.  A character whose creation is rushed into the narrative at the last hour, and holds no emotional ties to Wolverine and ends up being a big, but hollow, special effects light show.  Bummer.  With all the pathos this film contains the ending really could've sealed the deal for this film.<br /><br />Marvel now oversees the productions of all its characters' film adaptions.  Sometimes this is a good thing(Iron-Man), sometimes not so much(The Incredible Hulk).  Did we really need to be introduced to Deadpool, Gambit and Cyclops in this film?  Nope!  Sure, the fanboys had joygasms in unisen when they showed up, but the rest of us who put their comics away years ago, got nothing out of it but a slight crinkle in the upper left side of the cheek.  The actor who plays Gambi, can't think of his name, does an admirable job of hinting at the type of character he may be or become in future installments.  Nothing outrageously speical, but that has more to do with the writing and less to do with the acting.  He's adequetly charming for the part.  We also get some scraps in the form of other Marvel characters, none of us average Joes give a crap about like The Blob, The Wraith and Silverfox and others....<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was born to play this role.  Yes, fanboys will go on and on about how he's too tall and not squat like a wolverine(lol), but he embodies the pathos and physicality and strength of character I remember from my comic years.  I want more Jackman Wolverine but I want a better written film to go with it.<br /><br />The bottom line is, the film is passable or better yet servicable fluff fair.  You won't remember much about it after its over and it's about equal to the first X-Men film, but not quite up to par with the second or third film, or other Marvel Universe films released.  It's a good companion piece with Ghost Rider and The Incredible Hulk, good enough but nothing special.<br /><br />PS: Is anyone else out there sad that the first major films of the summer are sequels(Terminator:Salvation), re-boots AKA remakes(Star Trek) and spin-offs(Wolverine)?  It's starting to depress me.  I've heard great things about the upcoming Terminator and Star Trek and hopefully I'll like them, but damn, could we get something original in the E.R. stat!?!?!?!?'s a good companion piece with Ghost Rider and The Incredible Hulk, good enough but nothing special.

B001U0HBPG|4.0|You know the story: a baby is born old, and grows younger as he matures.  It's a strange story to bring to the big screen, though with some special effects, director David Fincher (and ain't this an odd movie for him to man the helm of) manages to pull it off.  The script does a fairly adequate job of tackling the issues that go with such a story: the old man falling for the young girl; the numerous awkward encounters and amusing-yet-touching \\"growing pains.\\"  The love story, too (which becomes central to the film during the second half) is rendered effectively.<br /><br />The problem is that the film lingers; it's a bit too long for it's own good.  This is a major error, of course, but it's at least partially forgivable: the film is beautiful to look at, from the ballets to the war scenes.  It's just a bit regrettable that there is so much of it...it becomes a bit overwhelming after a while, a bit too much of an emotional impact.  Still, note the 4 Stars in the review.  That's largely due to the caliber of acting presented here.  Pitt is the central figure, of course, and he's as riveting as he's been in most of his recent movies.  Cate Blanchett is a marvel as always, carrying herself with poise and dignity.  Tilda Swinton has a good few scenes as the uptight British woman Pitt falls for in a hotel; Jason Flemying, as Button's father, is another standout; and Jared Harris, as the captain of a tugboat, is simply fun.  The real scene-stealer here, though, is Taraji P. Henson, as Button's adoptive mother.  She shines, definitely deserving that Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress.<br /><br />It's a bit too long for the plot, and very indulgent on the part of the filmmakers, but THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is definitely worth a look or two.  It's moving, emotional, and definitely a sight to behold.

B001TH16DS|4.0|The video footage has been well restored and I really enjoyed the enhanced versions. Purists will also be pleased as each episode includes the original, unaltered version as well. Overall the restored footage made this worth purchasing.    However, here are the shortcomings, in my opinion  1. The menu system is awkward and a little over styled  2. The sound on my discs is irregular. The dialogue seems significantly lower than the music. I'm constantly raising and lowing the volume  3. No scene selection option  4. In memory of Majel Barrett-Roddenberry should have been more prominent considering her contribution to Star Trek. It's buried after \\"The Naked Time\\" episode. It pops up after the credits, the \\"CBS Media clip\\", and then a black screen that lasts several seconds. I only saw it by accident. This should have loaded at the beginning of the disc instead of a trailer you might watch once.  6. Disc one always starts with the movie trailer. The trailer should have been embedded in the special features menu. At the very least they could have used something more the \\"stock\\" trailer

B0018QCXGY|5.0|Being half way through six months of chemotherapy, I thought I would challenge the anti-nausea medicine they give me with each treatment cycle by watching Cloverfield - famous for its hand held camera technique.  I didn't get sick, and I loved the movie!  It is entirely realistic, entirely believable.  It has the intimate character-driven feel of an indie film, within the immense epic adventure of a major studio production.  The opening party sequence in which you get to know the characters looks like every wedding reception video ever shot.  When the mayhem starts, you are riveted to the screen, peering through the chaos trying to make out what is happening right along with everyone on screen.  This intense connection with what is going on is never broken right up to the end.  A really well done, tightly constructed film that is really fun to watch.
B00005JPY2|5.0|Seeing this in the theater on opening day was probably one of the greatest movie experiences in a lifetime. It's unfortunate that this movie had a 75% drop in its theatrical run after a successful opening, but not every movie is #1 5 weeks in a row, right?<br /><br />Watchmen is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It's a very well done adaptation. I've read the graphic novel twice, so I was excited to see this movie.<br /><br />And what an awesome movie it was!<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical about the almost 3-hour length (I don't have A.D.D), but in the end I was completely satisfied. I saw it with 3 people who hadn't read the graphic novel, and they even loved it too. I was very shocked though that there were kids at this movie, as if the rating 18A for \\"Gory Scenes, Brutal Violence\\" wasn't enough of a warning?<br /><br />The year is 1985. Nuclear War is a high threat. The doomsday clock has been set to 5 minutes to midnight. And an ex-superhero has been murdered. The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been thrown out a window to his death. Upon this happening, the minutemen, now called the Watchmen, a washed-up ex-ensemble of superheroes has reunited to to one thing- save the world from nuclear threat.<br /><br />Watchmen is a brilliant movie. At 2 hours and 43 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. In fact I actually didn't want it to end. The entire cast was brilliant. The movie isn't as humorless as everyone says it is, there's lots of dry humor where appropriate, there is lots of action, and another thing is that it fits the \\"problems of society\\" feel that the comic created. Also the omissions were not as bad as people are exaggerating it to be- I must admit I liked the changed ending a lot better than the book ending. It's more realistic, and I must admit the book ending made me go \\"WTF\\".<br /><br />I shall warn you though, this movie is very violent and gory. I am a gorehound, and I found myself cringing and going \\"Ewwwwww\\" at a few bits. Do not see this if you are squeamish, because it IS very brutal and gruesome stuff.<br /><br />So overall, I have not one single complaint about this film, because it's an amazing work of art. This is brutal and and gruesome stuff that if hard to watch, and I love it. Consider it Snyder's masterpiece! I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray when it comes out!eamish, because it IS very brutal and gruesome stuff.    So overall, I have not one single complaint about this film, because it's an amazing work of art. This is brutal and and gruesome stuff that if hard to watch, and I love it.

B001KNUQ64|3.0|There are some good and bad aspects of this release.    Good:  - The sound is much better than the official CD and marginally better than the bass-heavy DCC.  If you like the DCC's sound, then save your $30.  If you think the DCC is a little bottom-heavy, then splurge on this.  It is more open and present, though one should keep in perspective the fact that we're talking about a mono recording from the '60s.  It's no sonic marvel.  - That's about it.  Try before you buy on your local BitTorrent tracker to see whether the sound is for you.    Bad:  - A weird tape drop-out at the beginning of \\"I'm Waiting for the Day\\" that is not present in the DCC or any other CD versions.  - A huge gap between \\"Sloop John B\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\" that supposedly mimics the time in between flipping a record.  One of the nice things about listening to CDs is that you don't have to take time to get up and change sides.  I have never noticed this on any other digital release and think it's annoying.  Others may disagree.  - Why and how does this sound different from the DCC?  Both of them say they were from the original master tapes, which is obviously false information as noted in previous reviews.  I don't buy this stuff about the so-called Kensei Audio Transformer--there has been EQ tweaking on the DCC, the AF, or both.  This is either a good or bad thing depending on your opinion of the results.  - The packaging, advertised as \\"deluxe,\\" is embarrassing.  The slipcase looks like it was printed on grandma's 10-year-old inkjet and my copy has little bubbles under the sticker on top of the CD.  I have read a lot about broken teeth and cracking, which is not surprising given the flimsiness of the case.  Audio Fidelity is clearly a slapdash operation skating by on Hoffman's name recognition.  - The price.  Then again, it's cheaper than a used copy of the DCC.    All in all, I don't regret my purchase but I'm close.  The 1970s C&TP vinyl reissue is better, but this is probably the best available digital version.

0446677450|3.0|First half of this book is a great read.  Then the rest goes on and on about real estate.  He even says don't do real estate unless you love it and then rambles on about all the real estate he has bought or helped friends bought.  I have no interest in real estate and if I had I would most likely be bankrupt at this point considering the housing market in Michigan.  This was all probably sound advice in the 90's, but with the housing and credit markets the way they are now, only a few with enough cash put away could benefit from his real estate tips.  I say either borrow a copy of Rich Dad Poor Dad or buy it used.  I won't be bothering with the many other spinoffs from this book either as I'm sure they're just filled with the same stuff.  And seriously, almost $200 for the Cashflow game?
B001PA0FFO|1.0|Doubt (2008) tries to pass itself off as being about a morally ambiguous situation in which a conflict arises between an old nun and a young priest and there is simply insufficient information to determine who is the real wrongdoer.  However, what this film is really about is such questions as those of faith and certainty and doubt - the kinds of questions that plague philosophers.    For a movie about a moral problem with insufficient information the movie fails for failing to take a clear unequivocal stance in comdemning a clear wrong - either the clear wrong of a man preying on young children or the clear wrong of gossiping about those you know and damaging their reputations.  There is no \\"doubt\\" about this matter.  Both are clear wrongs and it must be one or the other.    As a philosophical movie that calls into question the nature of faith, the movie also fails in providing no termination point to the endless succession of generating doubts other than the apparent fact that absolute skepticism is self-refuting.  As such, the movie ends up wallowing in doubt which ultimately will lead to despair.  The movie does nothing to rectify this situation, offers no way out of this dreaded impasse, and leaves us in the midst of the mental meltdown of the old nun afflicted with this disease.  For failing to offer us hope and a foundation upon which one can build one's faith, this movie fails as well choosing instead to leave us dangling right over the abyss.    The movie also tries to address Catholic issues, showing the apparent conflict between the old-pre-Vatican II church and the changes made post-Vatican II.  The movie considers the \\"old church\\" to be one based on discipline and ethically rooted in the notion of virtue, which the modernist priest seeks to replace with \\"kindness\\".  The well-meaning and idealistic young nun is certainly a likeable character in her innocence; however, it causes her to become so naïve that she cannot even recognize that members of her own class are not listening or misbehaving until the old nun tips her off.  (Also, she thinks that FDR, Lincoln, and JFK were the three greatest presidents and states this pronouncement ex-cathedra coming straight from the chair of the self-appointed historical experts we all apparently know and look up to.)  Fortunately, the young nun learns that in order to control her class she must enforce some form of discipline, although she is not a harsh disciplinarian and apologizes once for being too harsh.  The old nun supposedly represents the pre-Vatican II church and places a portrait of Pope Pius XII above the board.  What is odd in this movie is how much power this woman has over a priest.  Further, she does not go to the proper channels, legal and hierarchical, but rather confronts the man himself, making a very awkward situation.  Ultimately however we simply do not have enough information to make a proper judgment as to who the guilty party is.  But we do know that we must unequivocally condemn them for either preying on young boys or for ruining the reputation of a good man.  The old nun appears to suffer from scrupulosity and is haunted by doubts and fears of sin in her own life and the lives of others.  She is a sympathetic character once we begin to understand the illness that afflicts her.  Unfortunately, the movie gives us nowhere to go from here.  It offers this woman no way to make redress, no way to ease her fears, no way to quash her doubts, and no foundation on which to build her faith.  As such, the movie creates a deplorable situation where everything becomes ambiguous and then wallows in its own doubt and moral relativism.  The movie of course will say that it is designed to make one think and that it is not meant to be \\"anti-Catholic\\", but ultimately it does neither and seems to serve largely as the all-too-familiar charges leveled against the church concerning pedophile priests, intolerant and strict old nuns, and a failing faith plagued by nagging doubts in a society in which doubt has been turned into a virtue.  As such, I feel that this film is positively harmful and its message is extremely negative and dissatisfying.  In the last scene, one searches for some hope but finds none.  Only further and further doubt persists.  Much as today's culture finds itself in.  A lack of fundamental trust where paranoia, fear, and mistrust run rampant.  A situation where it is possible to denounce those you know and work with for various crimes, real and imaginary.  And a general cloud of ambiguity that covers the whole thing making us believe that there are no moral absolutes anymore.  Thus, we see the real rot that has sank in as moral relativism inflicts its harm upon our culture and society and as doubt develops and lack of trust and paranoia ensues.    --  a Catholic reviewer.
0671015206|5.0|The only book I've read about money that's worth the paper its printed on.  Changed the way I look at money and what I spend it on.  Makes you feel better about driving your pedestrian passenger car and living in your middle class neighborhood.  My favorite part of the book is the study that shows the top two credit cards owned by millionaires are JCPenny and Sears!  Who would have guessed?  The book does get a little repetitive, but it really drives the point home.  The only way to become wealthy is to be thrifty and invest!  If you haven't ordered this book yet do it now, it will probably change your life.
055380684X|3.0|In spite of the cringe-inducing title,(it seems, after Dan Brown, any hack wanting to get a book published names it The '_____' Code), I mostly liked this book.<br /><br />Coyle's premise is brilliant in it's simplicity, explore places which generate a disproportionate amount of greatness in arts, athletics or scholarship and figure out what, if anything, they have in common.<br /><br />His conclusions regarding the importance of specific practice habits, motivational experiences and coaching techniques seem bang-on, and, in hindsight, obvious once you've read about his insights while visiting an assortment of young over-acheivers.<br /><br />It's a fun read, but he loses me on two points.<br />Firstly, Coyle is too eager to dismiss the idea of inborn talent.<br />While he rightly points out that the acquisition of skill is the result of deep practice, the degree of improvement still varies between individuals who share the same practice habits. Something more must be going on.<br /><br />Secondly in his giddy enthusiasm over myelin building, he potentially paints himself in a corner should we discover that the ability to build myelin has any genetic correlation,(which a recent UCLA study seems to suggest).<br /><br />In the end, he succeeds in winning me back by making satisfying digs against two of my most despised modern parenting practices, namely, Baby Einstein videos and the tendency to dish out un-earned praise in the name of esteem building.<br /><br />good read.
B001D2AYCI|5.0|A while back I reviewed the double cd Black Sabbath \\"Best of\\" and gave it weak score...something like 2.5 stars out of 5 or something. The reason I gave it such a low score was that I only liked a few of the songs on it, and on a double cd compilation, that is poor strike rate. Anyway, the other week, I reviewed the band's debut album and found that a more rewarding experience than finding out about them via a compilation album. What made it easier to buy \\"Paranoid\\" was that it has ALL of the songs I liked from their compilation. Which made a high score on this review as close to a certainty as you can get...a few terrific songs, on one cd...excellent strike rate.       So, if you've never checked out Black Sabbath before, speaking from personal experience I'd now recommend buying their first two cds. The first gives you an 'album' feel for their music, whilst \\"Paranoid\\" is pretty much a \\"Greatest Hits\\" experience. Will check out two or three more of their albums in the future, probably chronologically as well.       Anyway, quite a few months back I nominated Australian synth pop act The Flowers' debut album, \\"Icehouse\\", as the greatest debut in pop/rock history (well, at least for the debut albums that I've heard!). In similar vein, I am now nominating \\"Paranoid\\" as the greatest second album in pop/rock history. Their debut album really does not make you feel that they will explode on the scene with highly commercial and mainstream music. \\"Paranoid\\" makes you feel as if they have the song writing chops to keep on keeping on (my experience of their \\"Best of\\" suggests that this belief was unfounded).        Of the early rock records that I have recently explored, \\"Paranoid\\" seems to be the birth of what is recognisably popular heavy metal. I'm more comfortable calling this album \\"heavy metal\\" than their debut album. Here's what makes this album an all time classic (not just of heavy metal):    War pigs: running at just under 8 minutest in length, this is a passionate denouncement of those political and military leaders who insist on taking us to war. Written over a handful of years after Bob Dylan's immortal \\"Masters of war\\" (from the album \\"The times they are a changin'\\", which I've reviewed here recently), it's not quite in the same class as Dylan's stripped back polemic, but it is a close cousin to it. This is the era of cold wars (between the US and USSR, as it was then known), and hot wars (the US in Vietnam) and people feared the possible destruction of humanit on the nuclear mushroom cloud. \\"War pigs\\" is a classic of era, along with \\"Masters of war\\" (1964)and Barry McGuire's  classic from the following year, \\"Eve of destruction\\" (1965). Featuring an air raid siren in the introduction, \\"War pigs\\" seems to be the first heavy metal protest song, with its distorted riffs (the guitars practically ring out in this song) and melodic lead guitar. As usual, Bill Ward's drumming is interesting (his style seems similar to his contemporary, Led Zeppelin's John Bonham, it seems to me).     Paranoid: has a driving rhythm, distorted riff and melodic lead guitar. \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne's vocal delivery is interestingly done.     Planet Caravan: a lovely, wonderfully trippy song. Thought that maybe another band member took the lead on vocals here, but wikipedia states that Ozzy achieves his vocal effect on it with a \\"Leslie speaker\\".  A genteel song, with a New Agey vibe to it...has synthesiser, some piano, bass, and what sounds like bongos. A great song to have a hot bath to on a cold night!    Iron Man: my pick as the best song off the album. Has an ominous drum intro with groaning guitars. Then, one of the catchiest riffs in rock breaks out. Ward is not immune from walloping the drums on this track. In this song, the bass guitar is very lucid, which is what I like. Apart from the riff, there is some lead guitar work happening too.    Electric funeral: not sure if this song featured in \\"Best of\\", but I seem to have found the experiencemore rewarding on this album than that, if it was on that. Has a gloomy riff, which the bass shadows. The lyrics are, once again, towards the nursery rhyme end of the scale, but not in a bad way. The bass is interesting in this song but the backing singing is a bit cheesy...fortunately it doesn't go on for too long. Another Apocalyptic themed song...a product of the era from which it emerged. I suppose today's equivalents would not be so much concerned with the mushroom cloud, but with a environmental catastrophe (a nice example of that would the Midnight Oil's song \\"River runs red\\" from a good album of theirs called \\"Blue Sky Mining\\", which I've reviewed here).    Hand of doom: the last song on this album that I think is quite good (I've basically discussed the first five tracks in a row up until this one). Another epic song, runnng at just over 7 minutes in length. My favourite part of this song are the bookends to it...a slow, bassy groove. The middle part is more rock orientated and features a word picture of human decay. I could class this song as 'heavy metal'...more so than the songs from their debut album.    Other songs of interest(well, the album only has two more songs on it!):    Rat salad: Structured similarly too Led Zeppelin's \\"Moby Dick\\", this is an instrumental by the band, with a long drum solo in the middle. Led Zeppelin are argued by some critics to have invented heavy metal. Others attribute this to Black Sabbath. Led Zeppelin perhaps the catchier band jam on \\"Moby Dick\\", but if you like the spotlight on the drummer, you should like \\"Rat salad\\". In the mid 60's, Cream's debut album, \\"Fresh cream\\", also gave way for an instrumental, in \\"Toad\\". The drum solo on that is way longer than either Led Zeppelin's or Black Sabbaths...however, Led Zeppelin's John Bonham could make his drum solo stretch to over ten minutes, if he wanted to! My favourite drum solo instrumentals are \\"Dance with the Devil\\" by Cozy Powell, and Cozy Cole's \\"Topsy turvy (part 1)\\". Cozy Powell took his moniker from Cozy Cole.    Fairies wear boots: features a heavy boogie groove and good lead guitar at the start and the end. Has a chunky rhythm guitar too.    This album is getting 5/5 stars from me. The band is tight, and the bass is always there or there abouts. Rhythm guitar is chunky, the drums are interesting and the lead guitar does solo at times. Ozzy's vocals are glassy and always promising to break, without ever doing so. Not sure, but the sound mix in this album seems way better than on my \\"Best of\\" compilation...can't remember, but maybe I marked that compilation down for its sound quality. On this album, the sound is fresh, and you can isolate whatever instrument you care to listen to.     Have not had a chance to watch the \\"Quadrophenic\\" mix on dvd from this version, as I don't have the right equipment to do this justice. Did listen to the alternative version of \\"Paranoid\\" which comes with this version. It's the kind of version that you could either take it or leave it. I listened to it once, which is probably enough for me, but others may prefer to listen to it frequently. On that, \\"War pigs\\" is meant to be an instrumental, but you can very feintly here Ozzy's singing, occasionally, in the background. \\"Paranoid\\" has some incoherent lyrics on it, and the lyrics that you can make out, are not as good as the final product. \\"Planet caravan\\" also lacks the soothing vocal quality of the original...not sure, but maybe it is the original vocal, but just without the Leslie speaker working its magic on the song.    My favourite heavy metal albums, or albums by heavy metal acts are:    AC/DC: Back in black  Metallica: Reload; Master of puppets  Slayer: Undisputed attitude (album of punk covers)  Megadeth: Risk  Coldseed: Completion makes the tragedy (a great debut album)
B00288KNLS|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of \\"Coraline,\\" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed \\"other mother\\" (Teri Hatcher) and matching \\"other father,\\" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book \\"Coraline\\" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures.

B00026WU7I|4.0|Recently I've had the misfortune to buy cheap Bob Dylan cds only to go to a different store about a week later and see that there is a remastered version of the album (usually double the price of the older cd I'd bought). This seems to have happened again. I probably don't have the remastered version of \\"Blood on the tracks\\", but seeing as the older version is discontinued, I might as well post my review for the current edition.       I've taken to buying Dylan albums recently as I wanted to properly hear songs that I was unaware of, but sounded interesting on documentaries on the man (great songs like \\"Masters of war\\" or \\"Pawn in their game\\"). Then I started a poll on the top 3 Bob Dylan cds, which made me want to have a reasonable sample to choose from, to give my top 3. At the moment, I've given 1st place to \\"The freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". 2nd place is held by \\"The times they are a changin'\\". Both of those albums are reviewed at this site by me. Initially, I gave my 3rd pick to \\"Blonde on blonde\\". Currently, I'm giving that spot to \\"Blood on the track\\". Reasons? Well, I'm not a huge fan of Dylan and folk...sure, I like some of it. Even consider some songs to be masterpieces (like \\"Masters of war\\" and \\"The times they are a changin'\\"). So, it's not a simple matter of tallying up all the great and good songs on albums and ranking them, like I can do for pop/rock records. My method has to change. With that in mind, I vote \\"Freewheelin'\\" as a great, up-beat, accoustic folk album. \\"The times they are a changin'\\" is a terrific album for more down-beat, accoustic folk. \\"Blood on the tracks\\" is my third pick because it offers up something different, again...mellow, gentle songs.                  My picks as the best songs from this album:    Tangled up in blue: features delicate sounding accoustic guitars. Has a harmonica outro. Dylan's lyrics are rambling in this song, but not to any great detriment. Compared to his earliest albums, you get a very good stereo sound-stage on this song.    Meet me in the morning: steel string guitar features in this song. In fact, the guitar has an interesting sound to it in this song. An electric guitar also features, giving the song a country feel to it. The lyrical style takes a bluesy form to it. Song has bass and drums.    If you see her say hello: features delicate sounding steel string accoustic guitars, as well as a weird sounding string instrument (not sure what kind...perhaps of Russian or Greek origin?). Song also features an organ. Nice and mellow feel to this song. My cd seems to have a glitch around the 2:47 mark...a nice melodic progression seems to skip a few steps. Not sure if that is a problem with my cd or the master tape.    Shelter from the storm: more delicate, accoustic, steel string guitar. Bass features too. Did find the lyrics work better in this song than Dylan's more rambling songs. He returns to the title often, like a chorus.    Buckets of rain: although this song has delicate, accoustic guitar, steel string guitar, the strings seem high tensile, giving the guitar an interesting sound in this song. This song does seem to have some distortion in it, which I'm guessing is unintentional.        This album does have, for the most part, a uniformity of sound (delicate, accoustic guitar), which makes it mellow and easy-listening. The lyrics tend to the \\"slice of life\\" range, and focus on themes such as relationships.        Lyrically, the songs are more narrative in style. This can veer to being more a shaggy dog story than a narrative, as for songs like \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\". Whereas the other songs on this album don't really go for verse,chorus,verse structure of modern pop, they can wash over you pleasantly nonetheless. However, songs like \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" and \\"Idiot wind\\" are more demanding to listen to. For that reason, I'd say that those two songs are really out of step with the rest of the album. In fact, I'd call them 'expendable'. Both of these songs are epic (\\"Idiot wind\\" runs at 7:45 and \\"Lily...\\" runs at just under 9 minutes). They give the album its longish running time (at just over 50 minutes). Two shorter songs to replace them, in keeping with the tone of the rest of the album would have been preferable. However, if you like Dylan's more demanding to listen to songs (especially the pinnacle of that oevre, in \\"Hurricane\\"), you may get more out of those two songs than I did.        The attraction of this album is that it offers up something different from Dylan-apart from his upbeat, or downbeat albums. It's gentle and relaxing...accoustic guitars, delicate drumming, organ (Hammond?).
1439102813|5.0|I enjoyed reading this sensitive and knowledgeable account of EOAD (Early Onset Alzheimzers Disease).  It's a very good read.  One of those books that makes you care so much about the character that you continue thinking about her when the book is finished.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|As a kid in the '60s, I used to watch the old sci-fi serials from my parents childhoods. Buck Rogers Flash Gordon etc, they were hokey even by that time, but still a lot of fun.<br /><br />This week I had some time to kill, so I put in my DVD of [[ASIN:B0006IIPIK Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)]] and like those old serials it was fun, and corny, but unlike those old movie shorts it has Angelina Jolie, and Gwyneth Paltro (playing strong women), and some very cool CG animations that the old movies couldn't even imagine.<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is not what we expect in modern sci-fi, but if you are in the mood for something fun with some old time flavor, Sky Captain should do just fine!
0143038419|5.0|This is one of my favorites.  Written with great humor and irony, yet it's an emotional, sensitive and loving account of the author's life during a difficult but ultimately insightful time in her life.  It's great adventure and travel log too!
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Virtually everyone who's opinion I usually can trust just loved this movie last summer, but I couldn't get interested enough to go see it. However, when the Dark Knight came out on DVD, I bought it the day it came out and still... I never watched it until this week.<br /><br />So... I watched it and it was good, but I found it so dark and brooding that for me, it less than pleasant even while being amazed at the visual experience, and awed by some of the performances.<br /><br />So, if you are a Batman fan you will love it, if not...
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This product shipped before the expected date and it was a great suprise.  The product was in perfect condition.  Thank you.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|This movie was so predictable; I don't know why it had so much acclaim. First of all the subtitles were all over the screen and small. It was more violent than I expected. The acting was mediocre at best; even the \\"love\\" aspect wasn't believable. Very disappointing, sure glad I rented it for five dollars because that's how much you'll see these in a mark down bin very soon.
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|I can honestly say that this is the worst film I've seen in this decade.    And I like musicals. I was open to the ABBA music. But the directing and cinematography looked like an afterthought to a home-made video of some vacation in Greece. I actually looked away from the screen several times because I was so embarrassed for the participants in this film. The acting was horrendous; similar quality might not bother you if you paid $2 admission to a small town high school stage production, but this is supposed to be a professional film. Even Streep's performance was embarrassing, though she at least surprised me as a much more competent singer than her peers. Some of the actors' singing was jaw-droppingly bad. I found it almost unbelievable that the producers would release this in its current form.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I remember when this story hit the news. Alexander Supertramp was judged harshly by the media when his life met it's tragic end. This book and the DVD show the true heart of this young man who set out in search of what life was really all about.    Though depicted very differently at the time, he was really no different than those who climb Everest, go to the moon or explore the depths of the ocean. He was an adventurer and died doing what he loved to do.     This DVD was wonderfully done and brings out the truth of who he really was. I highly recommend it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I've enjoyed this show -- check it out!  It has fun interplay between the main characters and I like the plot lines and character development.  It's on ABC and this is the 1st season on DVD.
0374139563|3.0|As an international development person currently working in Africa, I think about donor dependency, corruption, and the value of aid daily. I was happy to see this book come out for some more perspective. I see in my own work much of what Dambisa talks about in the first half of her book (the aid critique) - how we prop up failing governments, and disempower the local people, since the government becomes more responsive to donors than to their own people. I have also become, over the years, a fan of free markets, particularly as a way to strengthen the middle class, which I believe is the primary driver of development in any country. I applaud the bold statements in the first part of this book. However, I was disappointd with the second half - her solutions. While many are good - there should certainly be more investment, and fewer subsidies/tarrifs on trade, I personally think that governance is a key issue here - alongside economics - and it is largely ignored. For every solution, be it bonds, FDI, remittances, or trade, Africa scores badly relative to other countries or regions. It's not \\"the West's\\" fault. Why don't African governments themselves feel accountable to their own people enough to make the right decisions? It is not for lack of knowledge and opportunity. Yes, aid is an easy choice for them to make, but greed and corruption, lack of respect for rule of law, and a disempowered citizenship - these things keep the powers that be in power, and most African leaders don't want to change that. So it is laregely their choice to take an opportunity or not. And while Chinese investment may be a boon - they are harldy the utopic partner that Dambisa makes them out to be. Their funds - given without contingency (even if the road gets built) fuels corruption, which does Africa no favors. In short, this is an interesting and thought-provoking read that I am recommending colleagues to read, as I believe the debate is important. However, I think the conclusions are abit facile, and other dimensions need to also be explored.

B0012C4CU4|4.0|This is a classic album. It's simply mad as a Hatter. It's as if they took all the sweet-greasy-tasty bits of techno, big beat, industrial and punk and smashed it down into one real trip of an album. Plus, how about the videos for the songs? Totally mental!<br /><br />After listening to it so many times in the 1990s, I finally got burnt out on it, and sold it for beer money. 10 years later, I had to buy it again and it's fresh as ever. It isn't as if anything new or original as happened since the time this album came out, right? Hint: if you every burn out on an album, put it in storage and don't sell it -- a time will come when you want to here it again.
0316017922|4.0|Like his best seller, The Tipping Point, Gladwell's new book, Outliers, examines a social phenomenon from a different point of view.  In Tipping Point Gladwell explained how fads become trends that become common cultural currency.  In Outliers, he asks a seemingly simple question: what factors empirically lead to an individual becoming extraordinarily successful?  His answer both reinforces and challenges western cultural myths of personal success.<br /><br />Americans have long worshipped at Horatio Alger's alter, extolling individual traits (intelligence and personal charm) and individual effort (hard work and risk taking) as the sources of great individual success.  Gladwell concurs that individual traits and efforts are necessary for extraordinary individual success.  But these are not sufficient to explain why some smart, charming, hard working, risk takers end up at the top of the world while other equally or even better endowed end up in the middle.<br /><br />Gladwell weaves examples of extraordinarily successful people, his outliers, and equally talented people living ordinary lives with empirical explanations of cause and effect.  He identifies two key external factors allowing outliers to achieve their extraordinary levels of success.  Gladwell's storytelling turns personal biographies into light-bulb moments illuminating the science underpinning his discussion.<br /><br />Outliers is a pretty fast read that gives general readers new insight into the phenomenon of success.  This book is not a self-help guide to achieving extraordinary success--very few of us will ever be outliers.  But Gladwell's clear presentation of the factors that propel particular individuals to achieve that level of success fascinated me.

B001TH16DI|3.0|Bare minimum that Paramount had to do to get these films out on Blu-Ray.  Disappointing actually considering how loyal Trek fans are with their dollars.  Why not include the Directors Cuts?  They have already been released in SD!  One can only assume that Paramount wants to double dip the hardcore fans.  Yes, fans will rush out to buy these movies on BR with the new movie coming out.  Then, in about a year from now, I am sure they will release the directors cuts.      I for one will save my $$ (especially these days) and wait to see if a true definitive version comes out...

B00008WT5C|4.0|AC/DC were a band that got better and better as the albums kept coming, and by \\"Let There Be Rock,\\" they were in their prime. Bon Scott and Angus Young were now a lean and mean machine, ripping their rock from the depths of depravity, making every song a straight shot from the amps to the ears. There's not a dud in the bunch.<br /><br />This was also were a couple of AC/DC anthems can be found, like \\"Whole Lotta Rosie,\\" the title track and (carried over from the Australian release of [[ASIN:B00008BXJ4 Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]) \\"Problem Child.\\" The songs surrounding them were almost as snappy, like \\"Dog Eat Dog\\" and \\"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be.\\" You could feel the intensity as the album builds.<br /><br />That build up was about to drop two incredible albums, [[ASIN:B00008BXJG Highway to Hell]] and [[ASIN:B00008WT5E Powerage]]. But for \\"Let There Be Rock,\\" there was every indication that AC/DC were on the march to world domination. Classic stuff.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|Mumbai, a frenetic metropolis and home to 14 or 15 million inhabitants, certainly boasts its share of glitz and glitter. It is the entertainment and commercial capital of India. It is home to Bollywood. But flip that coin over and you'll find the less glamourous side, that Mumbai also happens to be the site of some pretty deplorable living conditions. The poverty and squalor - and the quality of life attached to that - are horrific. And I guess it makes the ideal backdrop for SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, a film of seemingly relentless bleakness but a film which ultimately champions hope, love, destiny, and the tenacity of the human spirit.<br /><br />The plot is this: Improbably, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), an uneducated young chai wallah (tea server) from the slums of Mumbai, is one correct answer away from winning it all on the Indian version of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? But time runs out for that evening's episode and the flabbergasted audience must wait one more evening to see if Jamal can win the big prize. But Jamal is arrested and tortured, on the suspicion of cheating. Because how can a mere slumdog advance so far in the quiz show when even scholars before him have all failed ignominiously?<br /><br />The conceit of the movie lies in that each of Jamal's responses to the game show questions ties into a significant moment in his past. As Jamal reluctantly explains to the Mumbai police, the film flashes back to his painful childhood in the Mumbai slums. In the past, we meet his older brother Salim, a bully and avaricious and who soon becomes jealous of Jamal's close friendship with the young orphaned girl Latika. We see these three endure tragic life-changing experiences, as Jamal, Salim, and Latika claw out an existence by begging, stealing, and hustling naive tourists. Down the years, the three separate and reunite several times. Yet one thing never changes. Jamal keeps faith, believing that he and Latika are destined to be together. And that is the heart of the film.<br /><br />Based on Vikas Swarup's novel [[ASIN:0743267486 Q & A: A Novel]], SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is graced with dazzling technical mastery. Danny Boyle directs it and makes the thing accessible for western eyes. And, yet, the film does still feature a few of the core elements so favored by Indian cinema. Most notable is the gulf between classes, with the lead character so lowborn that when he achieves something seemingly beyond his capability, his integrity is promptly doubted and he is brutalized. Also regard the sweeping, star-crossed romance, that theme of love surmounting all odds, most definitely a staple of Bollywood's. And, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is by no means a musical, Danny Boyle couldn't resist putting in an exuberant dance number \\"Jai Ho,\\" staged during the closing credits.<br /><br />The story is solid, the hook is good. The film looks visually charged. It's sharply edited, with awesome cinematography, with the cameras capturing the bustle and energy and vibrancy of Mumbai, whether the focus is on the slums or on the city's rapid phases of globalization. The pulsating soundtrack contributes to the emotional texture of the thing (although I laughed when \\"Aaj Ki Raat\\" from DON came out, since I just saw DON again very recently). The actors are marvelous, with Dev Patel strong as the central character. The film covers three stages in Jamal's life, when he was roughly 7, 13, and 18. The children who play Jamal, Salim, and Latika are terrific, particularly Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Rubina Ali, who are very moving as Jamal and Latika at seven years of age. There is one moment which crystallizes Jamal's personality to the audience and young Ayush pulls it off perfectly, this being the outhouse scene and what Jamal goes thru to nab an autograph from his Bollywood idol Amitabh Bachchan. Really, from that point on, you're totally on this kid's side. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is essentially a flashback film, with the game show sequences used as aframing device. And, ultimately, it's the honest performances of the children which hooks you in. Fair warning, there are some very disturbing scenes played out during these kids' time on screen.<br /><br />Two other actors make an impact. One is veteran Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor and his trademark mustache. He plays the smug game show host, himself born out of the slums and who doesn't want Jamal to win the game and upstage him. Meanwhile, Freida Pinto makes an auspicious debut as the present-day Latika. She doesn't really have a lot of scenes or a lot of lines, compared to Dev Patel, but she makes them count. Freida Pinto is stunning. She has a presence and flashes such an utterly winning smile that the film flashes back to it several times. With her as Latika, I get how Jamal just never wavers in his efforts to reunite with her. Although, to be fair, Jamal fell in love with Latika before she grew up to look like Freida Pinto.<br /><br />What I have is the single disc version, with the following special features: the Making of the Film featurette (23 minutes long); 12 deleted scenes, all worth watching and key to filling in several gaps in the film - definitely check out \\"The Folder,\\" which reveals why the Police Inspector dealt with Jamal in the way he did; two audio commentaries, one with Director Danny Byole & actor Dev Patel, the other with producer Christian Colson & screenplay writer Simon Beaufoy; and the \\"Slumdog Cutdown\\" segment, which basically is a series of scenes from the film serving as a synopsis and set to the exhilarating song \\"Jai Ho.\\"<br /><br />As someone who's watched Indian cinema for a few years now, I'm so happy this film came out and I hope that it'll whet the appetites of more westerners, intrigue them enough so that they dip their toe into Bollywood films or Tamil films or Telugu. But if you're not sure yet and you're looking for a more accessible intro to Indian cinema, you should probably check out frothier films like [[ASIN:B00094AS9U Bride and Prejudice]] and [[ASIN:B001RP974C Other End of the Line (Widescreen)]]. Word to the wise, the Indian film industries tend to produce films which lean towards the more colorful, exuberant, and unabashedly over-the-top and sentimental, so prep yourself if you want to indulge in the real thing. I also recommend [[ASIN:B00078JZ74 Swades]], an awesome film which attempts to make a telling statement about the state of poverty and the lack of education in India. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE ended up winning a busload of Oscar awards, and justifiably so. In this film's depiction of the state of things with the poorer masses, I quote from a slumdog in the film as he is about to get trounced by the Indian constabulary in front of American tourists: \\"You wanted to see a bit of the real India - here it is!\\" SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE shows not all, but only a bit of the real India.

B001UREJWM|4.0|With a critically-acclaimed world tour in the rear-view mirror, the early 1980s Black Sabbath lineup revved it up in the studio and demonstrated that there was high-octane in the artistic engine.<br /><br />The epic tale in Bible Black is the centerpiece for the band - Ronnie James Dio (v), Tony Iommi (g), Geezer Butler (b), Vinny Appice (d) -  as the heavy metal is loud and proud. Atom and Evil, Double the Pain and Neverwhere keeps the motor running at high revolutions per minute.<br /><br />As much of a celebration as it is a return to recording new material, the fearsome foursome are clearly enjoying themselves, while delivering a sonic sound on an album that is a real live one.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Though not many agreed with me, I thought \\"Worrisome Heart\\" was the best disc of 2008, and one of the finest debut recordings in recent jazz history.  I marvelled at Melody Gardot's heart and soul, and her ability to craft simultaneously simple and complex melodies.<br /><br />But when someone starts off with something that good, then follows up with a sophomore release a year later, I worry.  The last time I saw that happen was with Peter Cincotti, and the result wasn't good at all.  I was worried:  could the same thing happen to Melody Gardot?<br /><br />Hints:  the producer on this one is Larry Klein.  The musical director is Kenneth Pendergrast.  The strings were arranged and conducted by Vince Mendoza.  The recording is mixed by Al Schmitt and mastered by Bernie Grundman.  A \\"sophomore slump\\" is probably not possible with that lineup!<br /><br />Though the disc sounds glorious, the glory enhances, rather than hides, the wonderful Melody Gardot.  \\"Heart\\" was endearingly quirky; \\"Thrill\\" is lush.<br /><br />\\"If the Stars Were Mine,\\" track #2, is the catchy tune on this set, and for good measure she reprises it at set's end.  And for good measure, Ms. Gardot does a French chanson, \\"Les Etoiles,\\" that sandwiches the tune(s).  These ought to be standards someday.<br /><br />But they are far from the only delights on this album.  Ms. Gardot displays a lot of heart and soul on the bluesy \\"Who Will Comfort Me\\" and \\"Your Heart is as Black as Night.\\"  And she swings whimsically on \\"Our Love Is Easy.\\"  The title track is haunting.  And Melody Gardot wrote all of these songs.  Except one:<br /><br />There's one standard on this set, \\"Over the Rainbow.\\"  I counsel singers not to sing this song, since inviting comparisons to Judy Garland is generally a bad idea.  But nothing in that counsel assumes a \\"country shuffle\\" version with a straightened out melody over the chord changes.  This is the most anti-Garland version of the song ever - and I love it for that!<br /><br />Recently, Jazz Times posited the question:  could Melody Gardot end up as big as Norah Jones?  Here's my answer:  in a perfect world, bigger.  In this world, let's just be thankful for her and pray that her health and her creativity stay with her for a long time, for our sake.  This young artist is a gem.  RC<br /><br />p.s. -12/30/09:  This and Jackie Ryan's \\"Doozy\\" are my favorite c.d.'s of 2009.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, in the theater, my reaction to it was pretty strong. I kind of felt overwhelmed by everything in the movie, the subject matter, the graphic violence against the children, the fact that so many things we take for granted, are not even imaginable for many people, and the \\"goodness\\" that moves the main character throughout the film. Added to this the brilliant cinematography, the super fast editing and the amazing soundtrack and you have a sensory overload, but I wanted to see it again, because I figured once I knew what came next, I could concentrate in appreciating the film. I was right. It gets better. The performances are wonderful,especially Dev Patel, who draws you in and makes you feel for Jamal (his character). I can truly say that it is a simple story that will give you pause and will stay with you long after you see it.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|There she stands against a wide horizon shielding her eyes against a glaring sun, a woman out of her element in a strange and savage new land. There behind her stands the big house of a western ranch, or tea or rubber plantation. A stoic strong man challenges her and their mutual attraction grows against a sweeping Technicolor canvas as the stereophonic lush romantic score swells to overwhelm our senses and pluck the quivering strings of our hearts. Sounds good doesn't it? This is the stuff of the silver age of Hollywood; the 1950's epics abound in these kinds of films. And now it is back in a BIG way.<br /><br />  Yes, we have seen this before, and unfortunately done with more conviction and brilliance. And when it is done right it is pure movie magic. For instance the incomparable George Steven's \\"Giant\\", or the lesser \\"Elephant Walk\\", or even the soapy yet very exciting \\"Naked Jungle\\" these are the fathers of inspiration for Baz Lurhman's \\"Australia\\".<br /><br />  This film is an ambitious effort that falls on its face under the weight of its director's choices to go way over the top too many times. Now don't get me wrong. I love over the top in my sweeping epics but in good and timely measures. Not from start to finish. It is just too much and becomes self-conscious and takes one out of the film experience.<br /><br />  The most indulgent of these choices is the casting of Nicole Kidman in the lead. She is too old and her face has changed by some sort of strange process over the last few years as to become hard and well, a little scary. But that aside her performance is not an honest one, she plays the comedy at the begining of the film straight for laughs and that rings false. Comedy in this kind of film and with this kind of character should be played dead serious to make it work. You just don't believe her and her acting is showing all over the place.<br /><br />  But there were some good things about the film. The boy who the story is really about is just a natural wonder, a pure old acting soul in a child that the camera loves. Hugh Jackman delivers all that is required in the male lead and in the process is natural and believable in the \\"Rock Hudson - Charlton Heston\\" mode.  The images of Australia are indeed stunning to behold and the cinematography is at times thrilling. But then she pops up in the shot with those puff lips and gives you a start.<br /><br />  There are those things to recommend \\"Australia\\" and on a purely visual level you might give it a try. Perhaps if you go in not excepting to love it, the film might work better for you than it did for me. On the other hand, I recommend seeing \\"Giant\\" instead to see how this genre of film can sing, zing and fly on the wings of &eacute;lan.pure old acting soul in a child that the camera loves.

He sounds like a used car salesman desperate to make a sale at the end of a slow month.  He'd be a lot more likely to close the deal if he toned down the superlatives about how great the stereo is and the new paint job and told me how to make the car actually run.

It adds a lot to the music and the whole idea that drives this organization, to see the musicians in this video.   -The values that this production embrace are another reason why I would recommend it. The main goal of this program is to create peace through music. Since music is indeed the universal language, all cultures, ethnic groups, etc. can enjoy the gift of music and also contribute to the music in the style that they particularly enjoy.   -The product is also high quality. I was surprised at the awesome sound, considering the locations of the recording, all the mixing,etc. And not only is it high quality, but it is well priced.   These are a few of the reason why I enjoyed this production, I hope you will enjoy it as well. I can't wait to see where Playing For Change will go next. -Arlyn

Gilbert's ability to draw the reader into her life in a way that causes you feel like you're right there with her, makes for an amazing journey. I meditate, but nothing like Elizabeth did during her four months in India. She threw herself into the experience and came out of it more whole and at home with herself than she ever had been. I was ready to pack my bag and take a sabbatical just to do what she did...and maybe I will before too long! This book taught me a lot about giving myself the opportunity to deeply experience the self through meditation...and maybe through food, too.

Obama gives us a glimpse of a leader in the making as he writes about his journey to pursue a life of meaning and passion in the world.

0545128285|4.0|I'm a Harry Potter fan to the point that if J.K. Rowling wrote a Hogwarts Cookbook, I'd probably read it. So naturally I snatched this book up just a couple of days after it came out, and I read it in one sitting (not saying much, considering its relative brevity). That being said, I felt a little disappointed. While the humorously academic voice of Albus Dumbledore is one of the high points of the book, none of the individuals stories has sufficient length for appreciable character development.    Overall, I would recommend this book, either for introducing another generation to the magic of Harry Potter or providing additional background for the most diehard fan. It's not an eighth Harry Potter book, but it's just as cool as the \\"textbooks\\" that were released a few years back. Don't waste your money on the \\"collector's edition\\" unless you've got a lot to spare; a decorative jacket just isn't worth it in most cases.    Possibly objectionable content: borderline graphic violence, somewhat depressing storyline in the Warlock's Hairy Heart (not as bad as Grimm's Fairytales though)    Recommendation: buy the cheaper version or check it out of your local library

B00005JPUN|3.0|The Bottom Line:    By far the worst of the Body Snatchers films, and the only one to not offer anything new or interesting, this version should only be seen by people who feel they need to complete the quartet.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I've had this watch for a week and I absolutely LOVE it.  If you like watches that are big, heavy, solid, eye catching, then THIS IS THE WATCH FOR YOU.  I'd read many of the reviews on Amazon, and  even watched a scathing review of Invicta on youtube regarding their poor customer service offerings.  I'd even read about some of the complaints related to this watch.      My experience was different and positive.  It was absolutely HUGE coming out of the box, but if you have built forearms or hands, it looks great.  The build quality on my watch was solid.  Everything worked as promised and it has exceeded all my expectations for what a nice watch should be. It's easily my favorite watch in my collection.  I hope your experience was as good as mine.      Oh...i almost forgot, the downsides to the watch, all those shiny, polished bits of stainless steel in the band scratch easily.  I'm meticulous about my watches, but already i can see minute scratches.  It's not knock against the watch, just a fact of life regarding polished finishes.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'll start by way of giving some background, I am not an expert, but I am an amateur audiophile.  I have owned the MDR7506 Professionals for 3 days, and can say that they are clear, pure, and comfortable.  My first pair of high-end head phones was a pair of Denons I bought in the 90's. I can't bear to listen to music on my Apple earbuds, though they are fine for podcasts.  I also own a pair of Sennheiser PX100s which are pretty good, but are open and disturb those around me, and they simply can't compete with these Sony's (though they are much more portable).<br /><br />The Sony's produce beautiful clear sound, and allow me to hear every detail of the music I am listening to, whether it is Hip-Hop, Classical, Latin or Soft music.  The bass is clean and warm, but not too boomy, and the mids and highs are pure and clear and not muddy.  They fold up reasonably well, allowing me to take them traveling, though it can still be difficult to fit them in a laptop bag.  The MDR7506s fit nicely on my head, though a little tight at first, they loosen up over time (I tested a well worn pair at a store), they are over-the-ear, and create a nice seal keeping the sound in, while keeping most ambient sound out.  I can certainly wear these next to someone sleeping without waking them up.<br /><br />The earcups are of leatherette and do warm up a bit with use, I haven't had a problem yet, but I haven't worn them for extended periods.<br /><br />The ONLY possible downsides with these headphones are that they may feel sweaty with extended use, and that the backs of the earcups are made of metal so when they are folded up, they tend to scuff the black paint from the first day.<br /><br />I recently tried the Sennheiser HD 555s and the HD-280s, though both produced beautiful sound, the 555s are open and so loud as to feel like they are playing for the person next to you.  The 280s, sounded delicious and were a bit cheaper in price but a bit bigger (it was a tough call between the 280s andthe Sonys).  But as I wanted these for traveling as well as for home, the 280s were bigger and didn't seem to fold up at all.  Also, they were tighter on the head and gave me the feeling that they would be uncomfortable for long sittings.<br /><br />I am very happy with these, and would recommend them wholeheartedly to anyone.
B000002N2P|5.0|This album is truly Green Day's best and most punk album ever.  This album has more bratty punk attitude than even their indie releases.  I bought this album originally on cassette when it came out in 1995 and wore it out.  I eventually purchased the cd when I got a cd player and still have and listen to it today (proof that cds really don't wear out if you take good care of them).  Altogether, I have been listening to this album for 14 years and it still sounds just as good as the day I bought it.  We've all heard Brainstew/Jaded and Geek Stink Breath, but other great songs include Brat, No Pride, Stuart and the Ave., Stuck With Me, hell, the whole album is great.  This album is a far cry from American Idiot/21st Century Breakdown.  It includes none of the rock 'n roll opera shtick, just good, old-fashioned sing along punk anthems with tons of swearing and no parental advisory label.  As a side note, the cover art is really cool too and folds out as a poster, revealing that the chick on the cover is really not playing guitar at all, but is actually holding a gun to a sleeping man's head.
6305428050|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Adventures in Babysitting is the type of movie that 13 year-olds will enjoy, but if you desire something a little bit more than cute adventures after dark you might be better off seeking Martin Scorsese's similarly-themed but far darker and better After Hours.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This movie is absolutely incredible.  You feel like you're in the room, directly communicating with McNamara.  Its really amazing to observe him relate his experiences; even in his 80s, his incredible intelligence, arrogance and colored memory of past events shines through brilliantly.  I especially enjoyed the way the movie wove through history chronologically.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Fantastic chemistry between the two leads, the daughter and mom are a riot and the supporting cops are more than just extra's.  The cast is a stand out, the writing is quite sharp.  This is a fun show.  Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic, just crackle on screen, they are electric on screen.  Fillion is too charming and Katic is a perfect foil.  Wonderful!
1423101472|5.0|I think this book cements my feeling that this is the greatest book series ever. The Last Olympian was a great book, the most action packed yet. The battles never ended!! Until the end of course........  Loose ends were tied up nicely, though I'm always sad when a series ends. It's like saying goodbye to family. Definetly get this book! Five stars for sure!
B001RTP48G|5.0|If you love the Pet Shop Boys then you are going to love this new album.  It is full of great songs.  Some of my favorites are Love etc., Did you see me coming?, Vulnerable, More than a dream, Pandemonium and The way it used to be. It's rare that you can find an album these days that has more than a couple of great songs on it.  Usually it's just the one song you hear on the radio. This one is full of great songs. I enjoy all of the songs and listen to it non-stop!  Great buy.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I typically hate comic books and really hate comic book movies.  This one, though, is the absolute exception.  The story is incredible, the acting is amazing, the special effects and action are great.  And the Blu Ray copy is absolute reference quality material.  Can't recommend it enough.
B001UE276A|5.0|I am a long time devoted Depeche Mode fan. So I purchased this box set initially out of respect for Depeche and their creativity. But I was really impressed by how much content I discovered on CDs and DVDs. Also, in case you haven't heard, this album doesn't sound as well in mp3 format due to high complexity of the sound effects. So having all these extra songs in CD quality helps me enjoy them much more. Books and pictures included are very nice. Anton Corbijn took the photos for the book and they really remind me of 80s and 90s music videos Anton filmed for Depeche. If you've seen short films Strange and Strange Too, you'll know what I'm talking about. To summarize: usually I don't see a lot of value in collector's box sets, but this one really stands out! If you love DM, please buy it, you won't be sorry.
6305308659|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. I think anyone that enjoys Art will find something to appreciate in watching this. This is one of my favorite DVD's -- now bring on the Blu-ray release! This film deserves it.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is a great movie, and very family friendly.  It involves one of the most socially awkward people ever to grace the screens (Napoleon); the best part is that he's so awkward, but he has absolutely no idea that he is, and readily assumes that's he's a dude, particularly as exemplified by his prom outfit choice.  Sadly, he completely reminds me of practically every classmate I had at college, gasp.
0312323867|5.0|I was so happy that there was another book following up after Something Borrowed. It wasn't quite as good as the first book but I definitely recommend it. If you aren't going to read it because you didn't like Darcy in the first book, think again. This book will really change your mind and it ties in well with Something Borrowed but is not too similar that it is boring. I usually am not a fan of sequels but I loved this one.
1932100660|5.0|This is an excellent book, I've already purchased many copies of it to give to other people. Well researched, well documented, and well presented.  A life changing book for sure.
B00005JLK1|3.0|This is an entertaining movie, particularly if you're a fan of horror movies including water/boats as a thematic element.  In a very broadstroke overview, a team of boat salvagers are led to salvage an otherwise illusively unmanned cruise ship...which happens to be haunted.  The acting is generally pretty good, the story is acceptable, and the production values are good.  In fact, the video quality is particularly good.  As usual, the ending starts to meander toward absurdity, but the rest is entertaining.
B00000F169|5.0|Whoduh thunk that Sergeant Pinback would oneday go on to help write and create one of the greatest sci-fi- franchises still going strong today - of course, I'm talking about the Alien franchise.  Which pretty much comes from the same structure played out in this movie.  An excellent low-budget \\"student film\\"...And John Carpenter helped a great deal too!    Still hilarious, still quoted and certainly still re-watchable!  Well done boys.
B00005V9HH|5.0|SPOILER:  Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors of my generation, IMHO, and his performance in this movie is no less than overwhelming.  He masterfully pulls off a gimp role, only to be masking an evil mastermind.  And the stories he yarns while under interrogation are very creative diversions from the ego maniac cop.  The final scene where he walks away is the best part of the film.
B000063UR1|5.0|This is one of the better science-fiction films out there. Long before modern-day Greeneer-than-green tree-huggers came along, Bruce Dern's character said it all with just a couple of robots.  Definitely a keeper.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I understand that this movie may be very loosely based on real events, but if you accept (for the purposes of furthering your own enjoyment) that this movie is based on real events, and you believe in ghosts/demons, etc., this movie rocks.  I would have enjoyed it more if it focused more on the girl's experiences (as opposed to the trial), but I suppose that that is one of the creative aspects of the movie. However, I found the horror very highly effective, and it is scary.
0132350882|5.0|Found myself laughing many times when reading some of these examples of horrific code and practices.  I'm currently in a project that has every bad example in it.  This book has given me hope for the future and the motivation to make my situation better.
B000G0O5N2|3.0|This movie is a classic, but the Blu Ray isn't necessarily so.  Its only a mild improvement over the SD version.  If you already own the SD version, I might recommend you not upgrade, unless you find a good deal.
1423101472|4.0|So here it is.  The final chapter in the \\"Olympians\\" series.    Sometimes I wonder whether a more in-depth knowledge of Greek mythology would enhance or diminish my fondness for these books.  I admit that the concept of the half-god children, usually identified through their dyslexia (god-based vision an' all), and ADHD (in-born battle awareness) is just...well....COOL!    And yet I wonder if the ancient Greek scholars, when they were struggling to explain natural disasters, the moving sun, and so many other things, knew that one day I'd be sitting in my home reading a book where the illegitimate son of Posiedon sat chatting with his father (who wears a Hawaiian shirt and Bermuda shorts) on the beach while fishing up sea monsters the size of skyscrapers (\\"Too small for eating, the game wardens would through a fit if I didn't throw that one back.\\"), would have looked at each other and decided \\"You know what...let's NOT try to explain this stuff.\\"    I get the feeling that serious Greek theology scholars in the world would cluck their tongues and grumble about inaccuracies in the gods' personalities.  Thankfully though, I don't know if that particular crowd is prone to perusing the childrens section at bookstores.    But I digress.    I shall assume that those of you who are reading this, or are ordering the book, will have read the first four installments.  You know where the story will pick up.  Percy and friends will face off against the Titan Kronos and his horde.  Which in some ways makes this review a little silly.  You've already made your choice.    So I give you only this: get the book and finish the story.    This is by far the most action-packed of the series.  The story begins with a lightning strike on one of the Titan strongholds and then simply doesn't let up.  Battles, battles, battles.  There's a mix-up in Hades along the banks of the River Styx, a standoff on the bridges of Manhattan, a throwdown between an array of the greatest of the gods and the mightiest of the Titans, and the epic last stand in the lobby of the Empire State Building.  And if that list doesn't make you giggle on the inside, this isn't the book for you.    Oh sure, there are a few chapters between battles, but they exist simply to allow the characters -- or maybe just the readers -- to catch their breath, mourn the inevitable death of a character, or try to tell Percy something without actually telling him anything.      That last point is actually mildly annoying, but I suppose I must concede to the idea that any story involving prophecies will be frustrating in that regard.  Since the characters aren't supposed to understand them, neither are we readers.  The story even ends with a prophecy that we also aren't supposed to understand, unless it's hinting at a sequal series.    Stupid prophecies.    That aside, this is a worthy series.  If you haven't read any of the others, pick up \\"The Lightning Thief\\" and get started.  It is well written, quite enjoyable, and hey -- if it gets kids interested in learning something about ancient Greek mythology...I'm ok with that too.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This movie is clearly one of the best horrors of all time.  Consistent with Carpenter direction, it starts of a little slowly, but really amps up near the end.  Keep in mind this is over 20 years old, so modern concepts of special effects are glaringly absent, but it still does a great job without being cheesy.
190669415X|5.0|This book was a very enjoyable read.  It is not hard to see how Stieg Larson's first book has become quite popular in America.  This second book will not disappoint when it is released here in the summer.  Larson keeps you guessing the whole time, moving the plot through various twists and turns.  I can't wait for the third!
B00009L1TA|3.0|I really like this movie.  I tend to get into military type films, especially modern day ones, even more so on the special forces kind, and even most so on jungle-ish settings (Tears of the Sun).  This falls very well in that category, supposedly set in Panama.  There are some neat action scenes, but you must be prepared for the fact that this movie will make no sense at all. And that's OK.  Its about the scenery, the cool acting, the cool action, etc.  Its not that the movie has any David Lynch-esque surreal plots, its just that once you understand what is going on (and the plot twists are a big part of the movie), you'll likely say a very noncomittal, \\"oh.\\"  So enjoy the eye scenery and avoid temptations to treat this like a real movie and make sense of a stupid plot.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|A riveting, thought-provoking film.  Winslet's character Hannah is numb, sleep-walking through life and Michael Berg brings her back to life, at least for a little while. Then we learn all the \\"why's\\" and become emotionally as torn-up as the characters by all the shades of gray.
B0012GVKW8|1.0|Being a die hard Predator (not Predator II of course) fan, I considered myself lucky to find the Blu Ray version on sale at target for $15.00, and I bought it to replace my SD version.  It is OMG terrible, could even be worse quality than the SD disc.  If you're considering upgrading to Blu Ray - DON'T!!!
B001B71NOI|5.0|i'm just starting to get into nine inch nails (i know i'm really late and i don't care).  i started with downward spiral which i loved.  then i downloaded this for free.  this one is more \\"rocky\\" than downward spiral it sounds similar to year zero alot of great industrail drum machine jamz and some really cool ambiant tracks.  most of the songs seem to have a really solid rock foundation with spacey dissonant synths parts floating in the distance, and it's a really great combo. i've been listening to it non-stop for three days now and haven't skipped a track. the song discipline is great, there's some cool \\"vocal fake outs\\" in it(listen to the song and you'll know what i mean). trent reznor is seriously a talented dude and i can't wait to see what he has in store for us next.
B0017APPSE|4.0|This is a good movie, good, not great.  The Blu Ray transfer is very good, not necessarily reference quality, but worth the upgrade.  I understand this movie has taken significant historical liberties, so if you're expect strict historical interpretation (and you actually know the story), you'll probably not enjoy.  However, that notwithstanding, its an entertaining movie, but you must enjoy the period depicted.  The acting is generally good (I especially enjoy Natalie Portman, but think that Scarlett Johansson is a very highly overrated buffoon), the sets are well done, and the story/dialog is not painful to sit through.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|You've heard it all. Dark. Brooding. Expansive. Heath Ledger rocks the house. Gary Oldman rules as a good guy for once. Aaron Eckhart is surprisingly competent.<br /><br />This is an impressive movie. It will have a lasting effect on you, trust me. It's extremely ambitious in both its visual and thematic conception. It hits the target on the former. It has qualified successes in the latter.<br /><br />But, again, you've heard all the raves. Why am I giving it four stars?<br /><br />Three reasons, and they all involve Batman himself. All are character issues and two figure significantly in the plot.<br /><br />First of all, Batman seems to exist in the story mainly as a contrived counterpoint to The Joker. He's not developed much and he's not really that important to the movie if you step back and break it down. Eckhart's Harvey Dent is.<br /><br />**SPOILERS** (For the twenty-three of you who haven't seen it.)<br /><br />Second, he faces a false dilemma in this movie that drove me nuts as I watched him grapple with it. Essentially, The Joker announces that he will start killing people until Batman reveals himself. Batman/Bruce Wayne agonizes over this. \\"It's all my fault! People are dying because of me! He won't stop until I turn myself in!\\" He then shuts down the Batcave and destroys all his Batstuff.<br /><br />Huh? Dude, the Joker was killing people BEFORE he made this little ultimatum. He will go on killing AFTER you turn yourself in. What's to agonize about? He's the bad guy, not you. Go catch him. Problem solved.<br /><br />I hated that gimmick and rolled my eyes as it played out. I didn't believe a minute of it. The only possible explanation I can come up with was that he was looking for an excuse to \\"retire\\" and The Joker gave him one. Like he'd calmly ride off into the sunset with Rachel Dawes as the Joker took over the city? Right. That ended up being a moot point, anyway. (And, btw, he sure didn't grieve very much over THAT development).<br /><br />**END SPOILERS**<br /><br />Thirdly (and I'm with Robert Downey, Jr. on this one), the epilogue makes no sense. Why does it have to end that way? Can't we just blame The Joker for turning Dent into Two-Face?SPOILERS**<br /><br />Thirdly (and I'm with Robert Downey, Jr. on this one), the epilogue makes no sense.

B000I0QM0E|1.0|Given that this is one of my absolute favs, I upgraded when the Blu Ray became available, only to my frustration.  The video quality is very poor.  Stick with the SD version.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This movie is my most favorite movie.  It's Beatles songs with a twist in meaning and the actors pulled it off well!  MUST SEE!!!
B00004RF9I|5.0|A must see picture that works on every level - it is superbly written, acted and directed. In spite of the industry it condemns, it IS entertaining in a way that occasionally raises the hairs on your neck.     \\"We're all you know! You're beginning to beleive the illusions we're spinning here.    You're beginning to think the tube is reality and your own lives are unreal.  You DO whatever the tube tells you!  You dress like the tube, you eat like the tube..  you raise your children like the tube, you even think like the tube.  This is mass madness, you maniacs!    In God's name, you people are the real thing!  WE are the illusion!  So turn off your television sets.  Turn them off right now.  Turn them off and leave them off.  Turn them off right in the middle of this sentence I'm speaking to you now! Turn them off!\\"    But before you do, watch this movie.  It can have the effect of confirming what you know about TV already - that it influences everyone deeply and no one seems to notice.      Great flick.  Entertaining and enlightening.
B000O75F7C|3.0|Porcupine Tree: excellent musicianship, vocals, etc.  It's just not my cup-of-tea so to speak, a shade too negative for me.  I love dark but negative is something totally different.  I rated it three stars to be as neutral as possible since the work itself is excellent but just not my taste.
0802136834|5.0|I love the book.  Me and my mother are into history, and this is a great book to add to all the others.  Very good book.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I have a confession to make: the first time I heard a song by Coldplay, I thought U2 had just released a new album. It was just after 'Clocks' hit the airwaves, and for me, it was the beginning of hearing a slightly different take on a familiar sound. Fast forward a few years to the band's \\"Viva la Vida\\" album and the U2 vibe still rings true; with the help of U2 producer Brian Eno, the album has brought Coldplay out of a musical rut and into the light.    Upon listening to the album, several images remain. It truly feels like London, full of darkness, light, history, and modern times. The record opens with 'Life in Technicolor', a vibrant instrumental. However, it quickly changes mood to 'Cemeteries of London', a more haunting song that evokes the mythology of London's darker side. 'Violet Hill' is a bit more rock than we've heard from the band in quite awhile; 'Death and All His Friends' starts out tender and then moves to a near-instrumental. And hit single 'Viva la Vida' uses strings to create a driving beat that is at once addictive and refreshing.    While the last record may have been flat, \\"Viva la Vida\\" is an album full of life - color, sound, and imagery. It's impossible to listen to it and not feel that the sun is breaking through the clouds to a new era. It's truly Life in Technicolor.
1577314808|5.0|I've read through several of the reviews here(both negative and positive), and I am no expert when it comes to religion, spirituality and the like.  I came to a crossroads in my life where all I cried out for was \\"Truth\\" and out of the blue I come across this book in the strangest way.  I had no idea who Tolle was, nor did I know anything about Zen or Eastern Philosophy to make a comparison...hell, I don't even watch TV..much less Oprah..but the contents of the book shook me to my core and I have never known the peace that I know now.      I know many of you are saying \\"but there is nothing new here!\\" but that's NOT the point.  The many religions and doctrines of the world have twisted the truth and made \\"God\\" into an image that fits our lifestyles.  You know the truth when you hear it(read it)and in my opinion this book speaks volumes of truth.      Nevermind the man.  It's the content of the message that is important to me.  I highly recommend this book.  Thanks to this book, my life has completely changed for the better and there's no looking back now.
0393327345|5.0|Fight Club the novel is a totally engrossing read right from the opening page. It unravels at a perfect pace and I enjoyed it more than I did the movie. This is the first book of Chuck Palahniuk's that I have read. It certainly won't be the last.  It's not a particularly long story, but it doesn't matter when a book is this good.
0618918248|1.0|Dawkins skillfully exploits America's post 9-11 stress disorder.      He directs all self-righteous wrath on brainwashed religious retarded fanatics blaming them in all the sins and troubles of America.      But he misses the point since religious does not mean religious fanatic or even somebody rejecting science and evolution. I do wholeheartedly accept both science and the theory of evolution and even despite all your skepticism in my ability to face your \\"immaculate argumentation\\", I do carefully read your book and will do it again six-seven times to able to expose all the paucity, narrow-mindedness  and aggressiveness of your atheistic worldview.      My God is a god of my heart, it is an Archetype of culture or spirituality which has nothing to do with science or even the outside reality in general.  Trying to prove or disprove God scientifically is like trying to prove Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  And I go to the synagogue and sorry for my fanaticism, I am ready to die for this privilege. Ready to die because it saved me from killing people in Afghanistan when I was sent to there by Soviet government. And my spiritual and moral convictions gave me power to defeat the Soviet army (disobey the orders and survive) and I'm proud of it.      And don't tell me which ideals I should carry in my heart: sorry, I have very high IQ in order to decide: as we say it in Hebrew I have been in your movie once. All your arguments are word by word repeating the theory of scientific atheism I was forced to listen in the country where my granny was imprisoned for just being a daughter of a rabbi.      You totally reveal yourself in your counting Einstein and other scientist as atheists Mr. Dawkins, though they have never ever considered themselves as such.  You say they were ashamed to tell the world their truth, but you know it better. How smart for you!!! Maybe absolutely opposite is true: as an educated Jew from the secularizing German society Einstein was ashamed of hisreligiosity?     Only two kinds of people were assured in their right to talk on behalf of others without any cast on doubt: communists and fascists. Only they knew the final truth and the way to make everybody happy.  Now point me to the concentration camp I should go, Parteigenosse!    Is it too far fetched, insulting and intolerant? But that is the only natural reaction on the insults and intolerance of your book.  By the way, in 60-ies so called fundamental Islam was virtually non-existing - it's rise is a reaction on what is perceived as thread and intolerant attack on traditional values, so next time you will give a lecture, please think about it: who contributes to further rise of it and future 9-11, Mr. Dawkin.
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse-Five is one of the greatest books I have ever read. Kurt Vonnegut narrates the partially autobiographical account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a fictional World War 2 veteran, as he struggles to make a life for himself after returning from bondage in Dresden, Germany. Vonnegut, known for his unconventional style of writing, fractures the story's time-line claiming that Billy Pilgrim has \\"come unstuck\\" and is traveling through time, showing us Billy's life as he sees it, not as we would. Using his overlapping time-line to effortlessly juxtapose civilian life after the war with serving as a prisoner in the soon to be incinerated Dresden and life in a zoo of the extraterrestrial plunger-like Tralflamadoreans, Kurt Vonnegut creates a literary masterpiece.   In World War 2 Billy Pilgrim finds himself friendless and lost behind enemy lines. Eventually taken as a prisoner of war, Billy finds himself working in a slaughterhouse in Dresden Germany making syrup to nourish pregnant women while he and his fellow soldiers starve to death. In the sixties Billy has returned to the general populous, become a successful optometrist, and after a brief stint in an asylum, married and started a family. Interrupting his life, Billy is abducted by the Tralflamadoreans, a satire of the univocal absurdity of war and human apathy, placed in a zoo, and mated with the movie star Montana Wildhack. As the order of events swirls seemingly capricious, these three plot lines, representative of past, present, and future, all confluence to the eventual climax of the fire bombing of Dresden.   Kurt Vonnegut plays with the readers emotions throughout the book forcing the reader's ruminate between laughing out loud and wanting to cry their eyes out. The three main story lines of the book, the war, life after the war, and Tralflamador, each invoke different emotional responses. After bombarding the reader with images of pain and suffering caused by the war, the time-line jumps and replaces the downcast imagery with the ironic story of Pilgrim's life as an optometrist or the ridiculous story of Tralflamador, eviscerating laughter and denying the cathartic reaction of crying just as the reader is about to breakdown. While this may seem hectic and sound cacophonous, Vonnegut pieces the story together in such a way that the ironies of a \\"normal\\" life and the satirical Tralflamadoreans blend together to heighten the sorrow evoked by the tragic plight of the American prisoners of war as they become emaciated echoes of the men they once were.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I couldn't believe that a 20 minute workout could kick my butt but this one proves it.  The only downside is that Jillian does not suggest what weight to use. I have been using 3 pound hand weights and that's about the max I would suggest.

You won't be able to look at a web page in the same way after reading this book. Krug gives you the reasoning behind putting things in certain places on a web page.  It's not random.

0345495004|5.0|Everyone wonders how Maymah (may-muh) Cheney could have left her husband and children to run away with Frank Lloyd Wright.  The answer is that she wanted to be a \\"person\\".  A married woman of that time entered into a role that was prescribed by the church and by the patriarchy.  She could not be herself, and she most certainly had to play the \\"role\\" of dutiful wife.  For a woman who was educated and intelligent enough to question the ruling paradigms, it was immensely suffocating.    Maymuh is like the main character of =The French Lieutenant's Woman=.  Once you do something big that is a serious break with convention, such as leave your husband and children or get pregnant out of wedlock, then you are shunned by the patriarchy and the church and the women who support patriarchy.  Then, since you are now in a wasteland, outside of mainstream society, you are finally free to make your own decisions and grow as a person.    Nothing has changed.  It is the same way now, especially during the ascendancy of evangelical fundamentalism during the Bush administration.  Women are still put into the same \\"roles\\" that Maymah was in, they are discouraged from making their own reproductive decisions, and premarital sex for women is stigmatized.  Women are still regarded as sexual objects and caretakers only, virgins or whores, and they are discouraged from questioning the patriarchy.      These attitudes hurt all of us, not just women.  They warp children and women, and they keep men from experiencing the love of a woman that is freely given, not coerced.    Maymah loved her children.  She wanted them to have, as an example, a mother who was living an authentic life.  Still, the book addressed the \\"cost\\" of Loving Frank:  not being able to see her children whenever she wanted, being shunned by society, and finding out that Frank had some flaws that were hard for her to live with.    Maymah is interesting only because she refused to follow the rules that kept her from being a person.  If she had stayed in the role that the culture assigned, we wouldn't be reading about her at all.

B000LC4TJ0|2.0|Seldom has such stellar talent taken such glorious source material and produced such unconvincing results. As an admirer of Netrebko, Schafer, Harnoncourt and \\"concept\\" productions in general, I looked forward to this DVD with much anticipation, and I find it hard to overstate my disappointment. Productions that add new insights by taking calculated risks are to be welcomed, but this one is too clever by half, misses the point and ends up compromising one of the greatest operas.    The main culprits are Harnoncourt and Guth, who have decided to turn this edgy and brilliant comedy into a dreary and often pretentious bore.     The set is a depressing over-scaled turn-of-the century interior gone to seed. Dead crows, feathers, leaves and other detritus litter the stage. This sets the tone, as the opera's extraordinary subtlety, inference, pace and wit are overshadowed by heavy-handed symbolism, occasional nastiness, and depressing, ponderous tempos. An unscripted teenager dressed as a cherub flounces on stage every now and then to remind us that the protagonists' love-interests are complex and intertwined, on one occasion providing us with a PowerPoint presentation in case we are too dim to get the point. Every time this ludicrous figure enters, the protagonists go into slow motion, which would be merely silly if the entire production wasn't already in slow motion, Harnoncourt having decided to linger over every phrase, in the process losing most of the sparkle and tension in the score.     Guth takes an outstanding cast and wastes them. Christine Schafer would have been wonderful as Cherubino had she not been forced into agonizingly slow tempi and ridiculous situations. In one memorable moment, when Cherubino says to the Countess \\". . . perhaps these lips would dare . . .\\" she does so after both the Countess and Susanna have been sucking Cherubino's lips off his (her) face. And then the unscripted cherub drifts in, symbolically dispensing feathers over the protagonists.     As for the rest, Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is a dour Figaro, Bo Skovhus a nasty Count, Patrick Henckens a bizarre Basilio in a wheelchair (on one offensive occasion, falling out of it). Dorothea Roschmann a pathetic Countess. Anna Netrebko tries her best as Susanna, but not even she can inject enough levity to redeem this humourless and pretentious show.      Not recommended.

B000NQPZCO|5.0|Usually when one thinks of Mafia movies, only the name of Scorsese and Coppola come up, but not this movie directed by the Brit Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire; The Awakening). Once again Pacino plays a mob figure but still it's quite different from Michael Corleone and Tony Montana--he's Lefty Ruggero, a small time loser/hood who hasn't quite achieved status in the mob, who has a girlfriend and a son who is a junkie.  Into his world comes Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) who poses as a jewel dealer but is in reality an FBI informer who insinuates himself into the mob when Lefty vouches for him.  Not only that but Lefty in sense adopts him as his surrogate son by protecting and coaching him in the ways of the mob.  More than just a gangland saga like \\"Goodfellows\\" or \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Donnie Brasco\\" is a intimate love story between two men which ends in tragedy and torment for both.  For Pistone as \\"Donnie\\", it is that sooner or later he will betray Lefty and for Lefty, it's only a matter of time before he knows he'll be whacked. There are also solid portrayals by Michael Madsen, the late Bruno Kirby and James Russo as the wise guys.  Also the Blu-ray is excellent in sound and visuals.  Do pick this one up--you won't forgetabout it!!
B001EOQWF8|4.0|In terms of its visuals this film deserves more than five stars, because it is amazing to see. Plot-wise...I know I am not in step with most people who have seen Wall-E, but to be honest I found the actual storyline to be a little slow moving, even boring a time or two. I think overall we have a winner here and it's worth buying, it's just that I don't join with anyone who places this atop Pixar's releases.<br /><br />The best moment in the movie? When Wall-E asks Eve about her \\"directive\\" and Eve first helps him pronounce the word and then takes a step sideways and announces, \\"CLASSIFIED!\\" An endearing little scene within a scene! A funny moment!
0385736002|5.0|Sophie Newman is at work when the world changes forever. Across the street from her, a sleek black car pulls up outside the book shop where her twin brother Josh is working over summer for Nick and Perry Fleming. Moments later the shop appears to explode, sending Sophie racing across the road to her brother and directly into the pages of history. For the owner of the shop isn't Nick Fleming but Nicholas Flamel, better known as the Alchemyst, and the Codex he has been guarding for centuries has been stolen by Dr John Dee, former magician to Queen Elizabeth the First.    Except this is happening in modern day San Francisco and Sophie and Josh have never dealt with magic before.     The Alchemyst doesn't stop, right from the very first pages the characters are given no opportunity to rest and neither is the reader. From meeting a 2000 year old Warrior Maiden who looks like a 17 year old girl to meeting the Goddess Hekate living inside the World Tree, the book keeps going and every page bring an ever increasing sense of danger and urgency to the storyline.     Characters from mythology and history are bought to life and fleshed out and set loose on the modern world, some hell bent on bringing about the destruction of humanity and some desperate to save it. Could Josh and Sophie be the twins of legend, the two that are one and the one that is all? Could these two teenaged humans have enough magical power within them to prevent Armageddon? Only time will tell, but the next instalments of this book will not come out soon enough.     It's rare to find a book that sucks you in so completely, even stranger to find one that sends you racing into other books to find out everything you can about the people in it. Every single character in The Alchemyst is real, apart from the Twins. From millennia ago to the recent past, names you've heard, names you'll know will leap out at you.     If you like mythology, history, danger, drama, death, sadness, love and above all, magic, you need this book in your life. Now.
B0010X745K|1.0|This otherwise creative and intriguing author has created his worst movie ever. The main plot was a bit corny, somewhat scary...I suppose, and a bit boring. Then comes the ending...I was so disgusted and dissapointed, I wanted to vomit. Tsk, tsk  This author has a created a great number of movies (and books) over the years that are interesting, unique, and that exceed expectations that are well worth watching. So, do youself a favor, and choose one of his other DVDs, you'll be happy you did :)
B00007BK2N|4.0|You might not like this film if you love [[ASIN:B000VZC4CQ Joy Division]]. I know it made me queasy the first time I saw it. There is something very callous about the way Ian Curtis' suicide is soon followed by a lengthy scene depicting [[ASIN:B000005IS7 Shaun Ryder]] gleefully slaughtering hundreds of pigeons. And there's no way that a Joy Division fan can tolerate the way Tony Wilson always puts Ryder on the same level as Curtis when talking about music.    However, the film suggests that the Manchester scene wasn't really for visionary poets and unknowable suicides. Yes, they were stars; they inspired fans; they thrilled audiences. But the audiences could be just as thrilled by Ryder's off-key holler, or by anyone else, for that matter.    It would be unfair to say that the scene was about the money. In fact, [[ASIN:075222025X Tony Wilson]] (at least, the way he is shown here) is hopelessly incompetent as a businessman. He is not a cynic. In a way, he really does believe in the music. But he believes in all music, or in the idea of music, without really paying attention to its content. Styles don't matter to him, he's just as happy with techno as with post-punk. He has a priceless line where he explains why he signed the middling band [[ASIN:B00080N5C2 A Certain Ratio]] (he wanted a post-punk band that would be less unpredictable than Joy Division). He says, \\"They had all the talent and energy of Joy Division, but they looked better!\\" And this is why he actually makes the ideal protagonist for a film about rock music (and also why the Happy Mondays are featured so prominently in it).    Wilson is bursting with vivacity. He somehow combines his day job as a TV news reporter with managing a record label and making cameo appearances on other TV shows, while still finding the time to do copious amounts of drugs. He praises every musical performance that he sees, no matter how bad it is. The film shows that the Manchester scene (and, by extension, every rock music scene) was really for people like him: energetic, charming, youthful, out to watch cool shows, get laid and have a good time. Everyone is really out for the experience, not the music. And if you weren't sharp or outgoing enough to be there, well, I suppose then you can start listening to the albums.    Yes, Tony Wilson is a vacuous (but appealing) con man. Shaun Ryder lounges around doing drugs right in the studio, ignoring [[ASIN:B000EJ9KJE Martin Hannett's]] pleas to get to work, with seemingly little interest in his own music aside from the fame it provides. The lesson here is that rock and roll is for people who choose life over art, while still being able to make engaging, dilettantish speeches about art.    Despite all that, 24 Hour Party People still manages to do Joy Division a lot better than [[ASIN:B00104AYGU Control]], Anton Corbijn's film about Joy Division. The musical performances, which subtly use actual footage of Joy Division concerts, are electrifying. The scene in which a group of skinheads starts a riot at a show (after Wilson's voice-over summarizes the social troubles of the day, with the deathless thunder of \\"Transmission\\" in the background), while Ian has an epileptic fit onstage, is aggressive and powerful. Those adjectives are not applicable to Corbijn's film.    The members of Joy Division are much more believable here than in Control. Ian is made to look more like an ordinary young man -- he's got youthful arrogance and ambition (his tirade against [[ASIN:B00001OH7W Bowie]] is great), but he's not Corbijn's Wordsworth-quoting gloom machine. His despair is more low-key, he is closer to the other band members (Bernard Sumner seems especially sympathetic). The scene in which Ian sings \\"Louie Louie\\" together with \\"the postman\\" and some other Factory guys pokes another hole in his black-marble romantic image, but it's kind of sweet. Yes, even the Joy Division guys liked to have a good time and were excited about their music. Sean Harris looks much better than Sam Riley in the role -- Harris' Ian is a skinny, introverted kid with a tightly drawn face, not a dream-boat with a chiseled chin and pouty lips -- and he also does a far better job of depicting Ian's theatrical intensity onstage.    The film is as tremendously energetic as its protagonist. It masterfully recreates the atmosphere of excitement surrounding the music, and fills out the more \\"informative\\" scenes with clever dialogue. The historical scenes are supplemented with actual footage from that time, which is spliced right in there with the actors. Tony Wilson gets his groove on at the famed [[ASIN:B000002KIE Sex Pistols]] concert while the real Sex Pistols play in the background. A shot of Sean Harris seamlessly changes into archive footage of Ian Curtis; they look completely identical. The film even deliberately shows Harris in black and white, until it becomes impossible to tell him apart from Curtis.    The narrative style is unorthodox. The archive footage sits comfortably next to absurdist scenes of [[ASIN:B000046QAA Bez]] encountering an obviously fake UFO, or Wilson breaking character to address the audience directly and list the real Manchester musicians who make cameo appearances in the film. This style of story-telling is so creative that perhaps we might consider this film to be, not just another pseudo-documentary, but rather the final great work to come out of Manchester's music scene. It was a fun party, if you were one of those invited.

B001AQR39O|4.0|Having absolutely loved Season One it was with a bit of concern I sat down to watch Season Two.. No need to worry however - it was a great watch and had it not been for Season One being just a tad better due to higher score for originality it lived up to and surpassed all expectations...<br /><br />The writing is again the pillar and the new characters being brought in add well to the cast.<br /><br />It of course begs the question if there is original material for yet another Season or two... but I for one certainly hope for at least one more season. If you loved Season One it is a must buy - if you disliked it I would strongly recommend you to stay far away!
1423101472|5.0|If your'e wondering what I mean by that title, at the acknowledgments, Riordan says \\"As the first camp-half blood series draws to a close,I must thank all who have stayed with me.\\" So,I sincerely hope that he does write more books, and that they are as good as these. So, any ways, down to the pros and cons.  Pros:  *The whole idea of the series that the Olympians are alive in the twenty-first century.  *The fact that there is not a super corny, lame ending like in Harry Potter( J.K.Rowling, you could have just killed ron instead of lupin!)  *There are many funny and serious moments,but not too much of either.  Cons:  *Not really anything.    So,in short, here I am, an 11 year old who has hopefully convinced you to READ THIS SERIES!
0060557818|4.0|This was a great book.  It was highly imaginative with some very unforgettable characters.  Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar come to mind. Very scary people! This book had quite a bit to offer although some images were rather disturbing.  It even had it's comical moments (funny to me anyway) such as near the end of the book where Richard Mayhew is in the back of his apartment building at Newton Mansions and is caught by neighbors while he is crouched down talking quite seriously to a rat.  I thought that was extremely funny.    I also enjoyed the concept of the \\"Floating Markets\\" and \\"Down Street\\" as well as all of the strange characters that made this novel so unforgettable.    I will never forget the \\"surface of the marsh\\" either (Ha ha! subtle sarcasm here). Who could? I was reminded of it so many times! For some reason the author thought it was necessary to repeat the phrase \\"the surface of the marsh\\" three times in a nine sentence paragraph and then once more in the very next paragraph for good measure.  He must have been tired when he wrote that part!      However, aside from that little blip, this was a really wonderful book and I enjoyed it very much as you will too if you read it.  I hope Neil Gaiman writes a sequel to this. It deserves a sequel.    Blue Lotus
B000F1IQNM|5.0|One sugar plum of a movie!  Very funny and a pleasure for kids and parents.  I much prefer this to Mary Poppins.
B000002H2H|1.0|How did this awful crap get 5 stars? I was a big big fan of their albums Load, Reload, and the awesome St. Anger, so I decided to give this one a try.<br /><br />First off, the bass is awful! I'm so glad that Cliff died, because he tried to play bass like Limp Bizkit and failed. Also, the songs are abysmal. In For Whom the Bell Tolls, they try to emulate St. Anger and put no solos in it, but it fails. And Fade to Black is an obvious attempt to be emo, but it did not make me want to cut my wrists. All the other tracks on the album are bad as well, and James' voice sounds prepubescent.<br /><br />Get St. Anger instead.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I didn't know what to expect from this album, but as a Cornell fan, the price was hard to pass up. On first listen, it almost made me think that the master of grunge had gone strait mainstream club music. However subsequent listens reveal excellent production by Timbaland which weaves textures through the album and creates something that is more than the sum of its parts. Props to Timbaland. And hell yeah Chris Cornell, for doing something unexpected yet amazing and proving that you are still relevant.<br /> -Much love
0316017922|5.0|This is a great book with big ideas. No one should expect to find hard \\"scientific\\" truths in this book because, in spite of Marx and Freud, man and culture are not very amenable to scientific study. Sociologist and psychologists conduct studies, make observations and attempt to reach conclusions. But that's not the same as proving Poincare's conjecture or discovering the graviton. Social science is a \\"weak\\" science and in my opinion, Gladwell makes sense in that context. It provokes discussion and makes people think. Not everyone has the time or disposition to read Chomsky or Gould or Foucault.  But most everyone has time to read Gladwell and time that most will enjoy.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|A lot of people said this was not as good a movie as Craig's first stint as Bond, but I think they are both good.  This one had a little more action, and the locations were closer to older Bond movies.  If you like Bond and Craig as Bond, this is a great film.
0380715430|4.0|This book is completely enthralling. It may not be completely accurate, as some other reviewers have pointed out, but as a layman's text it does what it's meant to do: hook the reader on the subject matter. For someone interested in linguistics, there is nothing boring in this book. It will definitely make you want to know more. In this case, I think it's more important that the text be interesting than completely accurate, especially as it's largely anecdotal: no one should be using it for a research paper. Once the reader's interest is captured, they'll go on to bigger, better books and have the facts straightened out. And if they don't, does it really matter if they're stuck thinking that Finnish has only one swear word? It's a fun book, and I highly recommend it to anyone even mildly curious about language and linguistics. It'll definitely pique your interest.
B0000AUHQF|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. GREAT that it is a true story. The real Rudy is behind the dad in the bleachers at the end of the movie.
0060926317|1.0|Mutant Message Down Under is a work of bizaare fantasy. Marlos original claims that this book was based on fact are highly offensive to Indigenous Australians. The author romanticises an ideal of the 'noble savage'. It is precisely this type of book that perpeptuates neo-colonialism. I suggest the author was suffering a 'mid life crisis', in which she attempted to use and invent a fictional notion of Indigenous culture for her own self satisfaction. Not worth reading! If you are interested in the topic, try one of Henry Reynolds book, or Richard Broomes. There are many credible sources that detail the cultures of Indigenous Australians. But Mutant Message Down Under is not one of them!
B001TAJGO6|5.0|I just rented this.<br />Simply put, this is a great movie.<br />It is very strange but you will love it.<br />I would categorize it as a Surrealistic Romantic Comedy.<br />When it was over we wanted to watch it again but we had no time.<br />Great Movie!

A must see for any batman fan.
044024367X|2.0|What a disappointment, even if you are only expecting another Jack Reacher formulaic book.  These are usually fun and light, and Lee still has the ability to tell a story, but this is really starting to feel like the last episode of E.R. or something.  Lee's last book, Bad Luck and Trouble, was a very good, if not great, read.  Nothing to Lose is not worth your time, I barely got through it.  Still, if you haven't read his first two Reacher novels, Killing Floor and Die Trying, do yourself a favor and start there: they are Lee Child at his best.
0007284764|5.0|I am a sucker for dogs, and especially books where we have some insight into what a dog thinks, and this book is that and more. The narrator is Enzo, the most loyal and wonderful dog, and the book deals with his devotion to his owner, Denny. Denny is a race car driver who not only has perfected the \\"Art of Racing in the Rain\\" but also has shown how that ability is also a life philosophy. It's a beautiful, touching book that I recommend.
B0000A118M|4.0|4 1/2    Often considered this legendary player's best and generally cited as one of the overall greatest recordings of all time, ALS undoubtedly represents Coltrane and his excellent crew at their early avant-garde best (easily argued as a favorite period), of which this blisteringly brief output suggested a spiritual threshold, compositionally crossed, that could never be rescinded. It's not quite perfect although at only three taut tracks the quartet seems at a precise alignment between excess and restraint to promote such holy themes, parlaying the album into an experience unique to his dense catalog.
0307277887|3.0|As a huge fan of the show, I decided to check out the first book in the series, and it's a testament to the show, really, that I much prefer that version. The problem is, for someone who's seen Season 1, that the book is pretty much exactly the same, MINUS a lot. I have more faith in enjoying the second and third books in the series as I know they veer off from the storylines on the show. However, this is not to say this is a bad book - it's interesting and well written - it's just not as good as the show.
B0018RWD5O|3.0|3 1/2    Crescent starts to peak early on, hinting at becoming one of Coltrane's most powerful ballad collections, but the second side feels underwritten in comparison, offering extended minimalist jamming instead of fully fleshed work.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Easy, fast read.  It was interesting to find out the reasons why the woman's character made the choices that she did. The book is better than the movie.  The movie follows the book closely, but moves a little slow.
0743243153|5.0|\\"The Road Less Traveled\\" will make you realize that you CAN take charge of your life and your destiny. It is a journey toward self-acceptance that will affirm that life is worth living. It is one of the best books I have ever read.     I was introduced to the book when I first began 12-step recovery over twenty years ago. I have had a long road to travel in coming to terms with my past and learning to accept myself. This is a powerful book for anyone who has come from a troubled background and who wants to achieve self-esteem.    I have built a wonderful new life for myself and I can thank the author for providing practical insights that have led toward my self transformation. I am now an author myself. [...]    My life journey has been one of discovering and affirming my spirit. The Road Less Traveled was an important stepping stone for me. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is on a spiritual quest.    Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\"
B000MQ54OY|5.0|This is a great movie for several reasons. It appeals to kids because of the dancing, music, and penguins. It appeals to adults because there are paths in the story that adults can appreciate (it goes over kids' heads most of the time). It is visually stunning and the acting is very good. Yes some characters are stereotypes but they are meant to be like that so the actors should not be criticized for what they were told to do. The story is not just a simple one-dimensional path from beginning to climax to end. There are several themes that are intertwined throughout the whole movie from discrimination, how environmental changes put stresses on animal populations, and how music and dance are both very deep forms of communication (Well... human communication but that's why it's a kid's film!). People unfairly criticize this film because they were not expecting such a detailed plot coming into a kid's movie. Don't be chained to your expectations and accept it for what it is--a very detailed movie that's really more for adults to understand than kids.     On this note--the rating systems for movies and video games are there for a reason. They give a parent or guardian a general idea what age group can handle it. Now I think that separation by age is not the answer, that it has to do with maturity which varies from child to child. But if your child is 4 YEARS OLD what the heck are you doing showing them a movie that's designed for kids at least 7 and older?! Wow... Give yourself a bad rating for ignoring ratings and not doing your research as a parent! On the other hand, kids under age ten probably have no idea that all this stuff is going on until you make a big deal about it. But the problem is that kids will see this material sooner or later so exposure with a parent is better than none but the movie is not offensive at all! If you watch any non-fiction tv channel like discovery or history channel you will see WAY worse stuff like, HEAVEN FORBID, animals mating or something. LOL. Even commercials on any channel are much worse than this stuff so it's really all exaggerated by really sheltering parents. I still don't know how the whole thing about penguins trying to find mates with absolutely no \\"bad\\" images and with lyrics that barely allude to sex (which kids hear EVERYWHERE unless you chain them to their bedroom door with no tv or radio or internet...or ANYTHING to do) is so bad... Maybe it made the parents uncomfortable!    Watch it and appreciate it for being a more mature kids' movie that breaks the mold to satisfy adults' need for a good story anyone can relate to.
B001TCAT9U|2.0|I was looking forward to this album as i love Depeche Mode. as soon as i got it i put it into my CD player.  The first thing i noticed was a re-emergance of the classic Depeche Mode Insturmental sound,  then the lyrics started.  The Lyrics clash with the acoustic intrumentals, at the moment I dont know where to rank it compaired with the previous albums.  It has some musical hint of Speak and Spell but clashes like Exciter.  Given some time i will most likely warm up to it.
044024367X|5.0|OK, first with the book.  I enjoyed this one more than the last couple.  It's a stronger outing and seems to be written with a little more care.  The story was strong, as was the other main character, Vaughn the Sheriff deputy.  Now for the kooks.  I can only imagine that they are either completely unhinged, or they were directed here by some ultra right wing group(s) to crap on the book because Reacher dares to speak out against the Iraq war.  Reacher has ALWAYS been his own man, and one of the main points of the stories has always been the duality of a guy that is now a complete loaner, drifter, etc.. who once spent the bulk of his adult life living by the very strict rules of the Army.  He loves his country, and therefore questions the actions that he sees are wrong.  Wow, how terrible.  Maybe Limbaugh sent you all here to make a stink, maybe you are all just a little nuts.  I think you all lean more to the latter..  I read NOTHING in the way he spoke that was different from other statements that he has made in other books, particularly later ones.
1595141979|5.0|Shadow Kiss, the third and best book in the Vampire Academy Series starts and ends with a bang. Though the entire series (so far) has taken place within the span of only a few months, I feel as if the characters have advanced and progressed so much during that time.     The tone of Shadow Kiss is a bit more somber than the prior 2. It also crosses into the supernatural, if you disregard the fact that it deals with vampires...    Rose keeps seeing things she knows shouldn't be there. Is she really going crazy? Is someone seeking revenge on her? She must unravel the mystery, all the while trying to deal with her friend Lissa's strange powers, her growing desire for her mentor, and her own instability. On top of that, her graduation from the Academy looms, as does the major Guardian Test which she must pass in order to officially be able to Guard Lissa, the last Royal in her bloodline.     I loved this book because the plot was more intricate and suspenseful than in the other two books, and even though I should have predicted it, the ending took me slightly by surprise. It sort of made me angry, not at the book, but how some things just happen, and you have no control over them. Now, all I can think about is reading the next book. I will certainly pick it up and devour every page when it comes out, and hopefully, there will be some sort of satisfactory conclusion.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Well I grew up a huge Star Trek fan so when I seen they came out with a 20th anniversary complete series box set I knew that I would like to own it.  After reading the reviews on here I was a little worried that the package would not survive very well because I am currently on deployment in Iraq.  That being said though I still took the chance and I couldn't be happier.  Not only did I get it in the mail extremely fast there was also no damage to the trays or anything when I openned it up. I of course was prepared so had bought a cd case in advance just in case so overall I am very satisfied with this product.
B001DHXT20|3.0|Ang Lee's version was unwatchable so I was cautiously optimistic regarding this version. I've always liked Ed Norton and while the casting may be strange, I figured he would try something different and interesting with the role.     I had a hard time trying to rate this film. I think without a doubt the first half of the film is the strongest, while the latter half was sort of ridiculous and over the top in a bad way. The plot is somewhat mangled, the characters range from uninteresting to downright annoying and the 'bad guy' Hulk was pretty stupid.     Ed Norton brought some personality to the title role but even he couldn't save this film. He has a specific look that works so well in most of the films he does, but here, well, it was sometimes odd to see him in character. Liv Tyler did the best she could with her boring role. Her and Norton's character couldn't be more different and trying to picture them together in anyway just didn't work.     The climax of the film, as I mentioned earlier is shockingly ridiculous. It is unintentionally funny and just loud and annoying. My 3 star rating is generous-it would be more like 2.5, but like I said, the first half of the film is respectable and had great potential. It's just too bad about the rest of it.
B000ZK4T98|5.0|The original was the best no argument there. But I disagree that Die Hard 2 and 3 were worth buying for a video collection. I regret not seeing Die Hard 4 in the movies on the big screen. I was one of the few who missed out on a truly great film similar and as exciting as Die Hard 1. The cool silver metal case with the extra disc was well worth the $12.00 dollars I paid which included S&H. This movie had some really far fetched happenings. Those scenes although unrealistic were still very enjoyable. If Die hard 1 and Live free or Die Hard was really die hard 2 and no other die hards existed I would have said those two series were my favorite action duo. Sure they went over the top in some scenes with the special effects. I have to admit they were still very cool. Buy this DVD, buy a good 5.1 system and sit back and let the bullets and metal fly around, just don't forget to duck. ENJOY!

B001NXBRJG|5.0|I won't go into detail in regards to the movie plot, as we all know just what the Matrix is all about. I will say this, though, The Matrix is an instant classic, which will be looked upon for many years to come. It brought not only a sense of \\"cool\\" and \\"style\\" to the action genre, but it bended the very though of cinema with \\"bullet time.\\" Great movie.   Now, unto the Blu-Ray.  The video is wonderful. Though you will mainly be seeing many shades of green and earthy colors on your display, the BD still strikes as demo-worthy. Color representation is great, with those greens looking very vivid, the blacks are just wonderful, very bold and inky. Detail is also top-notch, making sure you get ingest every single pixel in the Matrix. Great transfer, WB.  The audio is another great TrueHD track by WB. Bass is wonderfully strong, dynamics are strong throughout, and the clarity of the dialogue is on target. Pans are seamless, and even though the mix is 10 years old, it will still impress. Jump to the chapter where Morpheus is being held by the agents, and you will hear some great HD sound.   Overall, a package that is worth the money, specially if one disliked the other two dissapointing sequels. Take the red pill, and see the Matrix in HD.  5 out of 5.

0142000663|5.0|The crime and the sorrow that the subject sentences refer to was aptly characterized by Steinbeck in a previous paragraph: \\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten.\\" I first read those words some 40 years ago, have carried them with me, along with the intervening image that Steinbeck described, that of hungry people not being able to eat the oranges that had been dumped, and squirted with kerosene in order to destroy them, essentially because the \\"market\\" demanded it. The hunger that Steinbeck described in America has been attenuated, but not eliminated over the years, and there is still a vast operation here in ABQ, involving thousands of volunteers, to \\"feed the hungry.\\" I live only four miles from the old Route 66, and each day one can still witness America's \\"lumpenproletariat,\\" although they would certainly never use that word, wandering up and down the street, on their way to California, where their life will be different, or returning, after it proved not to be.<br /><br />With the \\"new hard times\\" upon us, and \\"the market\\" has again proven to be \\"a god that failed,\\"  I thought Steinbeck's book worthy of a re-read. It has lost none of its power over the intervening years; unfortunately the issues described resonate today. Only a few days ago there was a picture in the NYT of new homes being demolished in Victorville, CA, again, because \\"the market\\" demanded it.<br /><br />Steinbeck is a master storyteller. The epic of \\"those dustbowl days,\\" when large swaths of American farmers in the Mid-West were driven off their land, and turned into migrants, is told in microcosm, personified by the Joad family, trying to stay together in adversity, with the centrifugal forces pulling them apart. Ma Joad, in particular, is a stoic, heroic figure. And Tom was famously played by a young Henry Fonda in the movie. Steinbeck alternates these chapters with short, pithy descriptive chapters of the macrocosm, the overall social and economic forces that produced this tragedy. Steinbeck is a master of dialogue, capturing the rural patois of the heartland. His characterization of the members of the Joad family, and people they meet along \\"the mother road,\\" Rt. 66 is likewise strong. There are some charming vignettes, like the waitress in the diner, dealing with the nasty, economically affluent, and the kindness of truck drivers, the \\"knights of the road.\\" Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for this book; modestly he claimed he did not deserve it, but no other book has so successfully captured the anguish of that era.<br /><br />Lessons for today abound: \\"And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away.\\" (p324).  It didn't really work out that way. World War II was to finally provide the \\"meaningful employment\\" that ended the depression, and dealt with the issue of surplus production far more dramatically that kerosene on oranges. Essentially nothing has changed, save for the more global dimension of the issue, since Steinbeck wrote: \\"And money that might have gone to wages went for gas, for guns, for agents and spies, for blacklists, for drilling.\\" (p388)<br /><br />Later in life Steinbeck seemed to have forgotten: \\"...and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad, as a man must do before he fights\\" (p 386).  Steinbeck supported the Vietnam War!<br /><br />I was surprised and sadden by the number of 1-star reviews, mainly by high school students, \\"forced\\" to read the book, \\"irrelevant ancient history\\" that they might start re-living. One even said that Steinbeck was a communist, apparently not having read: \\"A red is any SOB that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five\\"! (p 407). Unlike some books that I had to read in high school, it is a good, solid, easy-to-read book.  Alas, many of these students will become adults, who never read a book again, though they might now have the time standing in the unemployment lines.<br /><br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was excellent the first time around, and equally so, and even more relevant today.that I had to read in high school, it is a good, solid, easy-to-read book.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|Charles Dickens' novel \\"Oliver Twist,\\" with its child protagonist and portrayal of criminals - their sordid lives in London's Victorian slums, and their exploitation of children, was made into a very successful musical motion picture, \\"Oliver.\\" Slumdog Millionaire\\" reminds me of a British-Bollywood version of \\"Oliver.\\" Like \\"Oliver\\" it romanticizes the terrible poverty of children who are left alone to live and die by their wits. Just as \\"Oliver\\" had more than a few extremely dramatic moments, some difficult to watch, \\"Slumdog\\" follows suit. Primarily, however, both films are made to be more entertainment than social commentary.<br /><br />Eighteen year-old Jamal Malik, (Dev Patel), is a \\"chai wallah,\\"  who serves tea to employees at a Bombay call center. Unbelievably, he manages to get himself on the popular game show, \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,\\" as a contestant. Although literate, Jamal has no formal education. However he mysteriously manages to answer all the difficult questions put to him by the show's egocentric host, Prem Kumar, (Anil Kapoor). It seems like all of India is watching to see if the young man, originally from the slums of Darvi, will answer the final question correctly, an answer which would net him 20 million rupees. The show ends with the promise of an even greater audience and more tension the following evening, when Jamal makes his final, and hopefully winning, appearance.<br /><br />The film begins with a scene of a Mumbai policeman torturing Jamal. The young man is beaten, waterboarded, shocked with electricity, you name it. Superimposed on the screen is a multiple choice question with four possible answers. \\"Jamal Malik is one question away from winning the jackpot. How did he do it? (A) He cheated, (B) He's lucky, (C) He's a genius, (D) It is written.\\" This is the same format as the \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\" questions. Mr. Kumar reported Jamal to the police on suspicion of cheating. After all, how could a slumdog know the answers to questions which have stumped doctors, lawyers, even Ph.Ds?  Finally, after an exhaustive interrogation, the police chief believes that Jamal may be legit, and asks him to tell how he acquired his knowledge.<br /><br />Thus, Jamal takes the viewer on an adventure...on many, many exhilarating, terrifying adventures. For every question asked on the show, Jamal has experienced a life event which gives him the wisdom needed to respond correctly. There are frequent flashbacks to his childhood, and these flashbacks are what I most enjoyed about the film. These scenes include the vast, colorful, impoverished hell of the Darvi slums, where he and his older brother, Salim, were born and try to survive. Adorable scamps, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, as young Jamal, and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, as older brother Salim, run with a crowd of children who inflict mayhem on their surroundings. Their energy is so contagious, that one focuses more on the baby hooligans' activities, mostly illegal,  than on their terrible way of life. In one instance, the camera pans out, and from high above the filthy slums look like a colorful patchwork quilt.<br /><br />The boys witness their mother's murder by a group of marauding, anti-Muslim hating fanatics. Left on their own, they meet another orphan in similar straights, Latika, a shy and lovely girl. (Rubina Ali plays the child, Freida Pinto the teenager). They call themselves the \\"Three Musketeers.\\" Together they hitch a ride on a train and are thrown off in Agra India, the home of the Taj Mahal. The boys, after a few days listening to guides, improvise an improbable history of the fabulous monument, and show gullible European tourists around, earning enough money to live on.<br /><br />The three children are eventually discovered by a Fagin-like character, the brutal gangster Maman, (Ankur Vikal). He and his cronies tell Jamal, Salim and Latika that they run a comfortable orphanage  and convince the kids to go with them. In fact, Maman collects street children and trains them to beg for money. He cruelly has some of them blinded and crippled so they can earn more money on the streets. Salim, who is being groomed for bigger things, sees one of the children being deformed and he and Jamal escape before Jamal can be treated in a similar manner. Through an \\"accident,\\" as Jamal is led to believe, Latika is left behind. Jamal never forgets her. He loved her as a child and will continue to love her as a man. His obsession is to find her. It is his destiny. Salim's destiny is quite different.<br /><br />To avoid spoilers, I won't continue to summarize the plot. I will say that I loved the extraordinary energy of the film and the wonderfully lavish colors, of the clothing, landscapes and characters. There are so many rags to riches fairytales out there, but this one is special. The last musical number, \\"Jai Ho\\" is outstanding - a great song and memorable choreography! The acting, by a relatively unknown cast, is usually excellent and the pace is fast.<br /><br />Screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy adapted the story from the novel \\"Q & A,\\" (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup. Beaufoy has expressed his joy at developing and introducing so many different genres and mini-tales within the overall story. Director Danny Boyle earned himself a 2008 Academy Award for Best Director and \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" won for best picture.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the adult characters of Jamal and Latika seem flat and detached. I also think the movie could be improved upon by eliminating the romance, which I felt was a bit cliched and confused.

0312370849|4.0|Two beautifully written, interesting tales entwined from past to present made this an \\"I can't put it down\\", memorable tale for me.  Here's the upsides and minor flaws I found to help you decide if it's for you.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Sarah and her family are torn from their apartment in the French 1940 round-up of Jews for deportation during the Holocaust. Julia, an American wife of a Parisian and journalist, searches for the true tale of what became of Sarah, while she also wrestles with a middle-age crisis of her marriage, and what she wants from it and life.<br /><br />UPSIDES:<br />Oh, there's so many! The drama of Sarah's story captures this painful period with grace and intrigue. Julia's story is engrossing in a different way - with interesting family dynamics and characters all around. (Though Julia's tale will no doubt have less appeal to those that can't relate or don't generally like tales of a middle-age crisis in a marriage.)<br /><br />MINOR FLAWS:<br />- About half-way through, what had been alternating chapters between Sarah's voice and Julia's - turn to Julia's voice only.  I missed Sarah's, as it was a nice balance to Julia's own daily angst.<br /><br />-The ending romance is the only place in the book that I felt was contrived or \\"taking the easy road out\\" to bring it to a finale.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Minor flaws aside, this is one of the best books I've read this year! A wonderful woman's book - just perfect for those that like to escape into another world with well-crafted words, characters and page-turning action.
B00150W1K6|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite NIN albums. Trent manages to change with each album and deliver a new concept and message with each one.  The first disc is the classic album with all of your favorites. My personal favorites are \\"Ruiner\\", \\"March of the Pigs\\", and \\"A Warm Place\\".  This album is a nice mix of his rock and industrial style. It also has some unadulterated guitar which you almost never hear in his music. The second disc is great as well. It has instrumental pieces and a couple of extra songs. My favorite part though has got to be the songs that are remixed. I have loved hearing the different ways songs like \\"Closer\\" and \\"Ruiner\\" can be portrayed. Highly recommend this album for any NIN fan.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The visual splendor alone captivated me, but the outstanding performances by the two leads, and a mind-bending/heart-wrenching story added together easily launched this movie into my top 10 all time favorites.  Some have sought to classify this movie as a fantasy, but that's not quite accurate.  It is a fantastical story with brilliant imagery, closer to allegory with its story-within-a story approach.  And in reality it is a story of loss and sadness, of trying to adjust, and of a struggle for hope that leads to redemption.  Multi-layered yet simple, and blessed with a beautiful musical score on top of everything else, this is a movie that demands to be viewed over and over again, rendering more and more of its treasures with each viewing.    An advisory note: the movie is rated R by the MPAA; it has several brief but graphic moments of violence, and involves intense emotional scenes of a mature nature. It may not be appropriate for pre-teens.

I was forced to Rip the songs, losing quality in the process, to another format to save them to my computer so that I could use the CD in my car. I wish this album had been released in both the enhanced and the regular format. I gave it five stars because of the incredible songs on the album. If I were asked about the \\"enhanced CD\\" experience I would have only given it a rating of two stars.
B000S0GYRU|4.0|Dario Argento's Suspiria has been called the horror auteur's best film, alongside [[ASIN:B000KRNG4U Deep Red]]. The first film in his \\"Three Mothers\\" trilogy and the last film to be processed in Technicolor, Suspiria showed Argento moving in a slightly different direction from the giallo subgenre. Suspiria is not a murder mystery nor is it technically a giallo, although many of the defining elements are present. Suspiria is more supernatural than any of his previous films and includes one of his most legendary death scenes.    Filmed in English, the film stars Jessica Harper as Suzy Banyon, an American who leaves New York to attend a prestigious ballet school in Germany. When Suzy arrives, she sees a young girl fleeing the school and Suzy herself is denied entry into the school. After Suzy leaves, the girl returns only to be brutally murdered in one of the most lauded death scenes ever filmed. It deserves the praise, as it's well-staged, well-shot, and quite memorable. Once Suzy returns the academy she meets Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), one of the instructors and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the headmistress. There's talk of a mysterious directress who's apparently \\"traveling abroad.\\" As bizarre events occur (a seeing eye dog attacking people, maggot infestation, etc.) and bodies pile up, Suzy finds that something more sinister may be happening at the school.    Suspiria is a slow build, despite that first death scene occurring only a few minutes into the film. I didn't find the film boring, but I could see why some viewer's do. The pace does lag and it doesn't jump right into the \\"mystery\\" of the story like Deep Red did in its opening scene. Argento co-wrote the script with his then-girlfriend and Deep Red star Daria Nicolodi. The script, apparently based on \\"true\\" stories told to Nicolodi by her grandmother, is possibly the weakest element of the film, with tacky dialogue marred even further by unconvincing delivery. With lines like \\"I once read that names which begin with the letter `s' are the names of snakes (hiss),\\" the actors can hardly be blamed for not sounding thrilled.    On that note; many of the European actors weren't comfortable with the English language and their lines were dubbed. The dubbing is noticeable, but as annoying as it could be due to Argento's stylistic ability.    Suspiria does have masterful set design and cinematography. The sets (the school in particular) are wonderful. The school is beautifully colored and exquisitely crafted, looking more like an elaborate painting than movie architecture. The cinematography by Luciano Tovoli is splendid and rather complicated. Tovoli works with constantly changing light and effortlessly makes the colors onscreen seem either vibrant or frightening.    Goblin, with the assistant of Argento, delivers a brilliantly creepy musical score that compliments each scene and has become almost as famous as the film itself.    Despite all these brilliant qualities the film has, I didn't fall in love with it the way I fell in love with previous Argento efforts. It's commonly called Argento's masterpiece and a masterpiece of horror cinema, but it's got those who've seen it pretty divided...I think this is due to the script. People who like their horror quick and to the point will find things they like here, but the film does plod along. Those who call it a masterpiece and are devout lovers of this film likely factor the film's style and creativity into their opinion. Suspiria is a well made film of any genre and, as a horror film, it is a masterpiece. It's got creative, memorable, and suspenseful death scenes and, unlike most horror films, it's made by people who know what they're doing but the plot lacks a central hook and didn't draw me in completely.    I won't remember the film for its plot, but for its style and imagery. Argento clearly possesses such a visual creativity he could've easily worked outside the horror genre and joined the ranks of Italian filmmakers like Fellini and Antonioni. Since Argento found his calling in this genre, he did provide audiences with some of the best examples of horror filmmaking out there. Suspiria does prove, even more so than Deep Red did, that horror can be both beautiful and scary...It can be art. I don't believe Suspiria is Argento's masterpiece, but it should satisfy many horror fans and certainly fans of Argento. It really is an impressive effort of any genre.    GRADE: B    NOTE-The lack of subtitles on the DVD is maddening, as some of the dialogue (especially when whispered) is difficult to understand at times.
B000QFBW6K|4.0|This is IMHO the best sounding Ring since Solti.  Barenboim's conducting is wonderfully engaging throughout and the cast, especially Tomlinson as Wotan, equals or bests any other.    One big warning:  the Wagner haters who seem to be in charge of all things Wagner, including Bayreuth, other than the actual poems and music, have here taken one small step further in their campaign to de-Wagnerize Wagner.  The English subtitles do not always honestly portray Wagner's poem as being sung by the characters.  Sometimes this is just to fit in some cheesy, unfunny double-entendre. But elsewhere they actually interfere with the plot and time-line of Wagner's drama.  So be warned.    Kupfer's production is typical Euro-silliness that for the most part doesn't get too much in the way of the music.  But the video director- one Horant H. Hohlfeld- seems to take delight in distracting us at some of the most sublime moments to cut to a close-up of some Kupfer silliness or other.  For example, in Act I of Siegfried just when Tomlinson reaches the climax of the gorgeous \\"Auf wolkigen Hoehn wohnen die Goetter\\" we cut to a close-up of Mime mouthing the word \\"Wotan\\".  Wagner makes it clear a few minutes later that Mime has identified the \\"Wanderer\\" so we really don't need all this childishly over-clever clutter.    And Kupfer often has the characters behave in a way that is the direct opposite of the way Wagner is portraying them musically.  For example, in Rheingold the gods are being portrayed musically as noble and dignified while Kupfer has them ineffectually running back and forth on the stage with no motive either in the Wagner-drama or the Kupfer-drama.  This kind of thing forces the singers to make some choices vocally and interpretively that they would not otherwise, and explains some of the oddities if you've listened to the CD set or the DVD one without watching (not a bad choice).    To show what this is bringing us to, when at the end of the tetrology (or trilogy-plus, if you like) Kupfer does some little schtick with a little boy escorting a little girl across the stage and off I found myself thinking, \\"That's kind of touching.\\"  The thing is, Wagner's original was more than a little \\"touching\\".    Still, this is the DVD set to get.  The music is superior and all the other productions are even worse- including the Met's, which by at first appearing to follow Wagner's intentions and then failing to do so becomes a fraud as well as a travesty.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I was depressed when I heard Leonard was touring again, but wasn't going to play where (and when) I could make it. When I saw this DVD on Amazon, I jumped at it and wasn't disappointed...  I loved it so much, I ordered the CD so I could listen to the music in my car...  Great songs, the backup players are superb, and he is just as amazing at 75 as he's been his whole carreer.  If you like Leonard Cohen, buy this DVD. If you love him, get the CD at the same time...
006135323X|3.0|This book covers an important topic -- humans seem to make systematic and therefore predictable errors and Dan Ariely attempts to flesh out some of these types of errors.  Most of this will be things you know intuitively but it's all VERY interesting -- I promise.<br /><br />The book loses stars for the authors exceptionally poor understanding of economics.  Ariely claims economics assumes all actors are perfectly rational -- simply not true.  One chapter discusses problems of will power and saving money.  Ariely proceeds with the notion that saving money is in fact the most rational thing to do.  He fails to account for the pervasive monetary inflation in the United States which makes the most rational course of action to trade your declining-in-value assets (dollars) for hard goods which (hopefully) will not decline in value (like real estate).  People do not sit down and make rational decisions about inflation -- but they *DO* understand intuitively that a dollar today is worth 90c in a few years, and 50cents in 20 years.  Spending every penny you can get your hands on *IN FACT* is the most rational thing to do in an inflationary economy.<br /><br />I also found this book to be lacking in scientific rigor, but do not let me dissuade you, its a good read and well worth the price.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This was a very well done film.  I knew to expect a shocking ending, but it still was not what I expected. The ending was so poweful!  We never need to forget the past and the terrible consequences of hate, prejudice and war.  This movie does a great job of portraying all of those.
B001U7FW1O|5.0|The Very Best Of Ultravox<br />CD & DVD (this is NOT a DualDisc release as stated)<br />2009 Chrysalis/EMI release<br />CD ~ 75 minutes.  Audio remastered by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road Studios in 2008 & 2009.<br />DVD ~ 73 minutes.  Region 0 (all regions).  NTSC format (not PAL format as stated on Amazon).  Aspect ratio: 4:3.  Audio:  Dolby Digital Stereo.  Produced by Abbey Road Interactive.  Steve Rooke 2008/2009 digitally remastered audio re-synced by Andrew Walter.<br />UPC:  5 099926 672229.  Made in the EU.<br /><br />I love when record labels put out these kind of sight and sound packages! The 2009 'The Very Best Of Ultravox' CD/DVD package gathers 18 U.K. hit singles on CD and 17 promo videos on DVD spanning the '80s incarnation of Ultravox -- Midge Ure, Chris Cross, Billy Currie, and Warren Cann. All four of these members reunited in early 2009 for the first time since 'Live Aid' in 1985 in order to tour the U.K. and celebrate their 30th anniversary, releasing this special collection in order to coincide with the occasion!<br /><br />The Ultravox '80s reissue campaign started in late 2008 with the 2-CD re-mastered definitive edition of 'Vienna', following with additional 2-disc editions of 'Rage In Eden', 'Quartet', and 'Monument' in early 2009. Sliding in during this campaign is this excellent sight and sound package from Chrysalis/EMI, released in April 2009. Of the 18 tracks featured on the CD a whopping 15 of them placed in the U.K. Top 40!<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this kind of package from Ultravox for quite a while now since I`m not really that familiar with their hits and back catalogue and have been curious to discover more.  One can imagine my excitement when I first read about this release.  It's not often that record companies combine stunning audio and video in one package!<br /><br />All audio tracks have been digitally re-mastered by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road Studios in 2008 and 2009. Seven-inch/single versions, mixes, and edits have been used whenever possible as well (see the tracklisting provided by Amazon), giving fans the chance to hear them as originally played on the radio and issued on 7\\" vinyl.  It's worth noting, too, for those picky about sound quality, that the music has not been brick-walled to death, meaning that the audio is not overly loud. While everyone has different preferences when it comes to audio compression, and frankly I'm fine with brick-walled sound most of the time, the audio restoration is impeccable!<br /><br />I don't think that these recordings have ever sounded this crisp and clean.  One can hear that painstaking work went in to transferring and re-mastering this music from the original master tapes.  I really appreciate it!  The clarity of tracks like \\"All Stood Still\\", \\"Lament\\", and \\"The Thin Wall\\" have left me \\"dancing with tears in my eyes\\".<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the DVD as well since Abbey Road Interactive, the studio which produced this DVD and has compiled other music DVDs for the EMI branch, can be hit and miss.  While the work from this studio is almost always good sometimes videos are not all presented in their best audio and visual form.  Fortunately, all promo videos have been re-synced with the 2008/2009 digitally re-mastered audio, and video quality, considering the age, is good as well.<br /><br />On another note, this DVD is actually NTSC format, not PAL format as stated by Amazon (thanks to Brendan for pointing this out to me!)  I had the privilege of watching these promos on a big screen plasma tv and was quite surprised at how grainy some of the earlier videos are.  It's different watching them on a huge screen versus a laptop screen.  Maybe the quality has something to do with the conversion to NTSC from PAL, the standard format in which these videos were recorded.  I would be curious to know what kind of, if any, effect that this conversion had on the quality. For a European release why weren't these presented in PALanyway?  That's the standard format!<br /><br />I am no visual expert, but based on other promos that I've viewed on similar releases of this era they all still look about as good as I have expected them to be.  I am not expecting the clear and vibrant picture of today's standards because it is simply not present on the original tapes.  Having these promos, including the uncut clip of \\"Vienna\\" and the uncensored cut of \\"Visions In Blue\\", on DVD for the first time is enticing enough!<br /><br />I must admit that I only really discovered Ultravox about 5 or 6 years ago after hearing a handful of their tracks on '80s Internet radio stations and `80s compilations that I`ve added to my own music collection. \\"Vienna\\", their biggest hit -- #2 in the U.K. for 4 weeks and #1 in Belgium, Ireland, and Holland -- amazingly never charted on the U.S. Hot 100. In Europe and around the world it is often cited as a masterpiece and classic, even ranking #1 on the countdown of the Top 75 songs of  the 1980s by BJMA in 2008.  It's amazing how many songs never made the charts in the U.S. yet are regarded as iconic recordings elsewhere. No matter how many more times \\"Vienna\\" will be licensed for future collections I will still never tire of it!  It never gets old!<br /><br />In the U.S., however, Ultravox are probably best known for the lone Hot 100 chart single, \\"Reap The Wild Wind\\", #71 in 1983, and managing to chart most of their albums in the lower half of the Billboard 200 Albums tally despite only gathering scattered radio airplay. Elsewhere, \\"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\\", a #3 U.K. smash and massive single throughout Europe in 1984, is probably the band's second most familiar cut after \\"Vienna\\".  However, these guys have so much more to offer than these best-known hits.  Want to discover more of their Top 40 placements?

I love her gentle approach.. she completely disagrees with letting a baby cry it out, and in truth, I noticed a dramatic DECREASE in the amount of crying from my boy (he was 2 mths when I read the book). He's much more independent and happy overall. When I tried to follow the cry-it-out theories from other books (like Babywise), he only got more fussy and clingy, not to mention it will break your heart to listen!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|On Death Magnetic Metallica turns back the clock in terms of their sound and musical approach and it serves them well.  Thankfully, gone are production oddities like the gargbage can drum sound of St. Anger.  The first half of this disc is solid metallic thrash, but the band really hits it stride on the last five songs.  The three song stretch of The Judas Kiss, Suicide & Redemption and My Apocalypse is the band's best in a long time, and is a flash of the band's brilliance in its prime.  Crank it up and enjoy!

B000OCXMAE|4.0|This is Linkin Park's third original studio album. First of all I am tired of all the people who hate this album and compare it to Hybrid Theory. Hybrid Theory was a long time ago. Every band has a right to go through musical changes. Not every album is goin to be a carbon copy of Hybrid Theory. Now that thats's out of the way, this albuim felt very new and less rap centered like their older stuff. I don't like rap. It just doesn't sound like music. I was able to enjoy Linkin Park a lot more with Minutes to Midnight. The opening track Wake is an intro with great guitar that leads into Given Up. The track order gives a rise and fall feel to the album where one song is very aggressive and the next is sad and slow. My favorite song is Valentine's Day, a sad very poetic song in which the singer must spend Valentine's Day after the loss of his lover. In summary this is a great album that every Linkin Park fan should try.

B000094HMU|5.0|Turandot is the one Puccini Opera that lends itself to the most opulent of settings. Franco Zefferelli is one of the few producer/directors who could fill the expanse of the Met stage with jewels in a setting. Domingo is at the height of his career and Marton is perfect as the icy princess. Kudos especially to Leona Mitchell as Liu and Paul Plishka as Calaf's father, Timur. Incidentally, there are the best Ping, Pang and Pong I've ever heard or seen. Grab your copy before it disappears from any profferings or gets a price like Julia Migenes' \\"Carmen\\" of $1,500.00. This production is a must-have for any listener of opera.

B000ZM1MGE|5.0|A young american man in on vacation in Istanbul, Turkey.  He has idea to smuggle 4 kilos of hashish and sell it to his friends in US.  Before even boarding the plane, he is caught smuggling drugs and taken to Turkish prison.  It all goes downhill from there.<br /><br />One month before completing his 4 year prison sentence, he is called into a court where it is announced by a judge that his sentence is extended to life in prison.  Without anything to loose, he creates bond with other westerners in prison in attempt to escape.  Depictions of torture, humiliation, emotional infliction of pain are so breathtaking that main character's descent into a rage is a natural progression of the conditions he is forced to live in.<br /><br />It has been almost 30 years since this movie was originally released.  I have seen it before, but as I grow older, film becomes more powerful.  Events are based on a true story.  It is remarkable story about man's instinct, desire to live and survive at any price.

I would highly recommend that you purchase this Grammy-worthy double album and save it for a solo drive or quiet evening at home when you can really listen to and appreciate its humor, humility, poetry, and musicianship.  They will blow you away!

1401207138|5.0|Oh, jeez.  Where do I begin?<br />Understandably, I can begin pretty much anywhere--what are the chances that anyone will even see this review, what with the 846 reviews (as of 12:44P.M., 5/7/09) that are already posted?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I must make an effort.<br /><br />There is a reason that this graphic novel is so dang popular, and a reason it has garnered 4.5/5 stars from over 800 reviews.  Not only does this book debunk what comics have become to be regarded as (action-packed, supernatural bang-'em-up books), but it also gets a seat next to the greatest and most influential novels of the 20th century.  And it case you haven't heard, it made Time Magazine's 100 Greatest Novels list.<br /><br />Now that's sayin' somethin'.<br /><br />Right from the get-go, Moore pulls us into his fictional parallel of the mid-'80s where superheroes/-ines have been banned from public crime-fighting activity, save for a select few but on the terms that they serve the U.S. government (how convenient).<br />The story begins with the murder of one of the superheroes--don't worry, this isn't a spoiler; the first page literally starts off with the homicidal investigation--and carries on to Rorschach's (another \\"superhero\\") curiosity about the murder.  From there, the story grows into a much bigger, darker, and more shocking plot than initially expected.<br /><br />The \\"superheroes\\" in this story are nothing more than average citizens who felt the need to eliminate the crime that the law enforcements weren't bothering with.  The only true \\"superhero\\" here is Dr. Manhattan, and even he can care less for the world.  The psychological balances and imbalances in this book are probably what draw most people into the story, as they deal with people struggling with common, internal battles on normal, everyday Earth.  (Rorschach's, to me, was especially the most interesting.)<br /><br />From Moore's brilliant story-work--including his inserts from essays written by the fictionalized superheroes, and the comic tale of the Black Freighter (ghastly, by the way)--to Gibbons' powerful illustrations, Watchmen is a real treat for comic enthusiasts and literary nerds (such as myself) alike.  I'm not sure how far Moore directed Gibbons in each of the panels, but even in the panels where there are no words, Gibbons' mastery of illustration does away with the necessity of words at all.  His animation is enough to tell the story.<br /><br />But what about Higgins?  People talk about Moore and Gibbons, but what about the colorist Higgins?  His brights and darks and everything in between are what really help Gibbons and Moore bring the story to life.  Without this trio, Watchmen wouldn't be nearly as powerful as it is.<br /><br />And so, I leave you with my opinion of Watchmen.  Who knows how many people, if any at all, will actually read this, but I felt it necessary anyway to write a review about this fantastic novel.<br /><br />Watchmen is must-read for any kind of reader (except maybe the young, as it contains some pretty graphic material (no pun intended)).  This story is a true delight, whether for its aesthetic appeal or its powerful literature.<br /><br />PS<br />I forgot I was reviewing the Absolute Edition!

Yes, it's about $30 or so more than the standard version, but you really do get a \\"deluxe\\" version of the book.

B00006879E|5.0|With their brilliant fusion of pop, funk and rock, Maroon 5 burst onto the music scene with a distinct sound and pretty much the complete package.  Whether he's barking to funk filled rhythms on tracks like `Harder to Breathe' or crooning on melodic ballads like `She Will Be Loved', Adam Levine always stands out as interesting and vocally gifted.  The smooth tone in his voice is perfectly crafted for this style of music, and it's that voice (and of course the band's commitment to Levine's style) that makes `Songs About Jane' one of the best albums to be released in a long time.<br /><br />The quartet of singles that came off this album (`Harder to Breathe', `This Love, `She Will Be Loved' and `Sunday Morning') are all defining moments on the album.  `Harder to Breathe' may very well be the song they will always be remembered for, their debut single and one of the most infectiously entertaining songs ever.  Who doesn't just love singing along to this song every time it comes on the radio.  `This Love' has such a funky cool vibe to it, totally into itself and it drips with this sweet sensuality.  `She Will Be Loved' was one of those songs I LOVED the first time I heard it but quickly got tired of.  Thankfully I haven't heard it in a long time, so now that I'm revisiting the album I find myself in love with the song again.  It is so sweet and charming, and it has this mellow tone that separates itself from the album.  `Sunday Morning' was one of my favorite parts of the album when I first heard it, and I was so delighted when it was made a single.  To me, of the four singles, it is the most definitive of the band as a whole.  It has such a smooth texture to it, just silky smooth tones and it just melts all over the listener.<br /><br />Beautifully done.<br /><br />The great thing about `Songs About Jane' is that the ENTIRE album is just as good as the tracks that got radio play.  It really is a complete album, without an ounce of apparent filler going on anywhere.  Every song feels like it was meant to be there.<br /><br />`Shiver' and `Not Coming Home' have a special `POP' to them that sets them apart from the album.  `Shiver' is just flawless, so much fun and it just has this vibe to it that reminds me a lot of Justin Timberlake; that undeniable coolness that makes you desire to hear it again and again.  `Not Coming Home' is very similar in style but it's not mere copycat; it is just as fresh and enticing.  Adam's vocals reign supreme on both these tracks, but especially on `Not Coming Home'.<br /><br />Tracks like `Tangled', `The Sun' and `Through with You' carry the smooth funk vibe, nothing vibrant like `Shiver' but it has musical arrangements and vocals that just caress you.  This is the kind of music that feels almost comforting; soft and warm.  `Must Get Out' has an old soul, and I like that about it.  It feels almost vintage to me, but it works for it maintains the freshness that the album has.  I absolutely adore everything about `Secret', a track that is soft and delicate and reminds me of Incubus almost, the softer `Drive' like side of Incubus.  This is seriously one of the best tracks on an album full of `best' tracks.<br /><br />And then there is the closing song, `Sweetest Goodbye', and how sweet it is.  It's a very gentle song, nothing overpowering but it sums up nicely why this band is so remarkable; for even in their subtlest moments they make a lasting impression.  So, when the album closes we cannot wait to listen to it from the very beginning.  From that funky freshness of `Harder to Breathe' all the way down to the serene flow of `Sweetest Goodbye', `Songs About Jane' never disappoints.s meant to be there.    `Shiver' and `Not Coming Home' have a special `POP' to them that sets them apart from the album.  `Shiver' is just flawless, so much fun and it just has this vibe to it that reminds me a lot of Justin Timberlake; that undeniable coolness that makes you desire to hear it again and again.  `Not Coming Home' is very similar in style but it's not mere copycat; it is just as fresh and enticing.

1932907009|5.0|I have something to admit from the start:  I hate industry books.  Whether it be acting, writing, directing, craft servicing, whatever - they usually tend to be a lot of \\"rules\\" that one must \\"follow\\" for \\"success.\\"  Having worked in the entertainment industry, I know there are no steadfast \\"rules\\" that one must \\"follow\\" for \\"success\\" (OK, a few, like don't punch a casting director at an audition, don't copy scripts word-for-word, etc.).  I do enjoy show business-related books that give a different perspective on how to find success in entertainment - from people that have, you know, found success.  What \\"Save The Cat\\" does is present a tried-and-true style of getting your idea to script-form that has worked a number of times for Mr. Snyder and can easily work for you.  Don't believe it?  No problem, as Mr. Snyder presents example after example of how it does actually work.  However, he never says it MUST be done like this or this is INDUSTRY STANDARD or DON'T DO IT ANY OTHER WAY!!  He simply states:  I've done this and it's worked for me.  Should work for you.  It's a brisk, entertaining read and the concept of his style of screenwriting is so basic in it's lay-out and so well-explained, there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't put the book down and hop right on Final Draft.  It's not a cure-all, and it's not going to make everybody a great writer (thank God, we don't need the competition), but it's just \\"a way.\\"  And it's worth trying.  As I mentioned, the book itself is so well-written in it's presentation of his method that it is flat-out entertaining as well.  There are behind-the-scenes tidbits, industry analysis and educating anecdotes from a writer that's been in the game for a while.  Heck, if you're up against a wall in your career, the last chapter alone is worth the read, if for nothing else than to help you pick yourself up by your boot-straps, shake off the dust and get to work.  (Then go back and read the rest of the book to find a great method for doing just that!)

There are plenty of reviews here to read about Shane but I just wanted to let any younger people out there know that old movies are still just as enjoyable to watch.

This review relates to the latter. I've been reading in most blogs and review for this DVD that it doesn't have or comes with any Special Features? If you purchase the 2006 \\"Everything Duckie Edition\\" it does indeed come with:   Audio Commentary from Director: Howard Deutch and includes Featurettes: ·   1. \\"The First Time: The Making of Pretty in Pink\\"  2. \\"Zoids and Richies\\"   3. \\"Prom Queen: All About Molly\\"   4. \\"Volcanic Ensembles\\"   5. \\"Prom Stories\\"   6. \\"The Lost Dance: The Original Ending\\"   7. \\"Wrap Up: The Epilogue\\"   Text/Photo Galleries:  Photo Gallery:    Unlike the 2002 DVD which only featured the movie and nothing else.

B00006ADD5|5.0|Since there are countless reviews of the film (which is amazing, gorgeous, and thrilling beyond compare!) this will be a review of the single disc DVD version of this fine film.      This DVD had all the features I was looking for...... complete opening, intermission, and closing music... all provided in digitally mastered 5.1 Dolby Digital and Anamorphic Widescreen. No other special features to speak of.... but it does provide subtitles in a variety of languages which I think is always a nice addition... as well as scene selection.     This DVD was beautiful to watch and listen to.  If you are a fan of the film and are looking for something to hold you over until the 4k version is released (in my dreams!)..... then this will do quite nicely.
B00005JO20|4.0|My gosh, can Peter Jackson make a movie.  The creator of the epic, magnificent [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 Lord of the Rings Trilogy]], easily the most ambitious endeavor in cinematic history, Jackson knows something about letting visuals tell a story.  And in this respect his remake of KING KONG doesn't disappoint; this is a feast for the eyes--an enticing visual thriller packed with enough special effects/CGI to keep you in your seat (for almost four hours, which is saying something).<br /><br />No need to rehash the plot; what I will say is watching Kong unleashed in Manhattan, circa 1933, is fabulous and wondrous viewing.  Jackson spares nothing, from the gaudy neon lights, to the hot dog wagons.  And the climactic scene, atop the Empire State Building?  I suffer from acute acrophobia, so for me this scene was both excruciating, and spellbinding, to watch (which means Jackson made it all look so very real).  Once this scene concluded I literally felt physically drained.<br /><br />So why the four stars?  Well, the film takes much too long to get going, and it doesn't really start to move until Skull Island.  I love Jack Black, but here he is hopelessly miscast as an ethically-challenged filmmaker/promoter.  And Adrien Brody looks more like Napolean Dynamite than a leading man, but that's just me.  I will say Naomi Watts looks right at home resting in Kong's paw, yet the \\"love story\\" in this respect definitely tweaked the \\"ick\\" factor.  But to heck with all that.  Peter Jackson's got the chops to make a great cinematic product, and KING KONG squarely fits the bill.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B00000251N|5.0|When I was in my teens I went to see the movie and fell in love with the music. You wonder how they can make a movie about seagulls? I'm sure it was not easy, but with the music, the story was touching and memorable. I immediately bought the album (yes, album) and though I eventually got rid of all the others, this one I kept. Problem was I did not have a record player and decided to get the CD. Inside the album cover there's a message from Neil Diamond to the director of the movie which said, \\"I don't want to be Jonathan's voice, I want to be his heart,\\" and he did just that in this soundtrack. It's what got me hooked onto Neil Diamond and from that time on I went to his concert every time he came to town. During his concert he would go off stage and on the screens a laser dot would appear. This dot grew bigger and suddenly wings would emerge. The audience would yell \\"Jonathan\\" all at once. Simply amazing. I honestly think this is one of the best soundtracks ever made.

B001SN78JO|3.0|Essentially a cock-eyed variation on \\"Liar Liar,\\" \\"Yes Man\\" presents Jim Carrey as a bank loan officer who spends most of his off-duty hours actively avoiding social engagements with his friends and co-workers.  A \\"lonely guy\\" by choice, Carl undergoes a life-altering experience when he attends a self-help seminar dedicated to the proposition that one can get a whole lot more out of life by saying \\"yes\\" when opportunity comes a-knockin' than by saying \\"no.\\"  Soon, Carl is agreeing to virtually every offer that comes his way, often to surprising and hilarious results.<br /><br />As a generally generic Carrey vehicle, \\"Yes Man\\" doesn't provide much in the way of a thespian stretch for the actor, who could toss one of these roles off in his sleep if he wanted to.  On the positive side, the movie feels less contrived than some of his previous efforts, thanks to the fact that it doesn't rely on some cheap gimmick like a magic spell or a knock on the head to get the plot rolling.  The decision to become compulsively agreeable remains an act of volition on the part of the character, thus making the tale more relatable and grounded in the long run.  Nobody is better than Carrey when it comes to over-the-top mugging and he is frequently in prime form here.  Moreover, there are quite a few genuine belly laughs that are alone worth the price of admission (with a randy encounter between Carl and his aged landlady achieving the movie's high point of hilarity).<br /><br />On the downside, \\"Yes Man\\" does have a whiff of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about it that it is never entirely able to shake.  Moreover, there is a certain threadbare quality that is almost inevitable when a movie's premise is built, as this one is, on the repetition of a single note.  And there are some definite dull patches when the comic ideas seem to be withering on the vine.  The compensation, beyond Carrey of course, comes in the form of two noteworthy supporting players: the likable Bradley Cooper as Carl's best buddy, and the winsome and charming Zooey Deschanel as the slightly offbeat motorcycle-riding band singer Carl meets and falls in love with during the course of the story.and charming Zooey Deschanel as the slightly offbeat motorcycle-riding band singer Carl meets and falls in love with during the course of the story.
1933771690|1.0|I'm very interested in the subject matter, and I am fascinated by the underlying question (\\"Does it make sense to describe a universe as \\"real\\" if there is no sentient life in it?\\").  But this book simply doesn't deliver anything substantial.<br /><br />The author derides \\"new-age\\" idealists who want to claim that \\"quantum theory\\" supports their beliefs without explaining *how* in any significant detail -- then proceeds to do exactly that.  Over and over, Biocentrism appeals to the same kind of false dichotomy that creationists use -- \\"Conventional science doesn't answer all the questions so that means that our ideas are better\\" -- but without making any kind of necessary connection between quantum theory and the author's \\"principles of biocentrism\\".<br /><br />Yes, they are *answers*, but they're not sufficiently defined or tested, so they're no better than the appeal to intelligent design as an explanation for why the universe looks complex.  He describes how the extraction of information from quantum-entangled particles causes the wave function to collapse and the particles to exhibit behavior in strange ways.  It's something of a leap in judgment to say that it's \\"consciousness\\" that causes this, but there are no ways to formulate the experiments without the involvement of consciousness at some point.  Biocentrism goes even a further step beyond and states that consciousness *creates* reality, rather than merely saying that consciousness *constructs* the picture of reality that we carry around in our heads and write books about -- which was a \\"new\\" idea in the 18th century (Kant's \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\").<br /><br />There is something here worth investigating, and the author is right in pointing out that consciousness appears to play a role in some pretty astounding ways.  Ultimately, he goes way too far without providing anything beyond \\"heck, it *could* be this way\\".

I wanted to add strength training to my weekly routine so I could work on toning.  This video is perfect for that - 3 levels of 20-minute workouts that kick your butt.  I am really noticing results, and it is hard to find excuses not to fit in a 20-minute workout.  I am also pretty uncoordinated and this is not hard to follow.
B000PC0U1W|2.0|I love this movie for its modern Orwellian tale and wonderful performances. I give it a low rating simply because when I compare it to other Blu-Ray transfers, it amazes me that a 2006 film would have glare as if the telecine was not light tight. For 75% of the film the sharpness and blacks look good, but for about 25% (especially dark scenes) there's what looks like a light leak in areas that should be pitch black. The studio should really think about stopping production on this disc and take it back in to remaster it. Then they can send coupons to the owners of the first release for exchanges to what should have been done right the first time.  Why does this transfer have issues that Donnie Brasco, 3:10 to Yuma, and Casino Royale don't have? If they want us to pay more for the Blu-Ray format, the studios really need to make sure they are providing the best product; otherwise people like myself will be out there to tell everyone to hold off until they hear that there has been an improved version released.
0446677450|5.0|The life changing book that has been a personal finance best seller for over a decade written by author Robert T.Kiyosaki. This little book has changed the lives of many people and their perspective on money, who are in misery, not knowing how to make ends meet due to lack of financial education. The contents of this book, tells the story of a young man, who is the author himself, being brought up by his natural father the conventional way of getting a job, saving every penny, working hard and climbing the corporate ladder. At the same time, he also had a \\"second father\\" who taught him a different way to view things and how to start from scratch and build his business into an empire.    I am sure many of us can relate to the story on the part where we were being brought up the conventional way to become workers. As much as we don't wish it to be that way, ironically, the education system plays a very big part in educating our fathers and their fathers to be trained into workers instead of educating them and inspire them to become business owners. Ignorance of other available choices, we are trapped in a eternal cycle of working for money, saving up and spending on wasting assets that constantly drains our finances and loses value over time. Welcome to the rat race! Unless we learn and educate ourselves on personal finance, we will be unknowingly stuck with only one way of thinking, and passing that knowledge on to the next generation. Talk about vicious cycle!    The main point of this book is to educate yourself on personal finance, which is to learn how to become financially independent by making money work hard for you and not you working hard to earn every single penny. It teaches you that you do not have to be a slave to money and to turn the situation to your advantage. There is no need for you to work for another person if you do not want to, in order to fulfill what you want in life. You are in control of your situation and you no longer need to take ordersfrom anyone.  You decide how much work you need. You are your own boss!

B001IBIQU6|5.0|Ahhhhh, the wait is over...<br /><br />You cannot go \\"wrong\\" here. These are truly songs of the universe at its best: powerful, strongly written and performed aural delicacies that spirit the mind and expand the soul. Martin Gore has always been a premier songwriter and master showman. Dave Gahan's voice is like a fine wine that has aged to near pop perfection (I tremble at the thought that he almost didn't survive the nineties).<br /><br />The majority of the songs on this brilliant and fulfilling disc are hypnotic, stimulating, and certainly addictive, as they satisfyingly wind their way into your brain cells for ongoing bliss. I thought the instrumental was quirky, and weak (compared to their other instrumentals, which are usually highly soothing and intriguing: remember Christmas Island and others), and I would have liked more Gore solos; but all-in-all it's a fantastic album!<br /><br />I have followed DM for close to three decades and have never been disappointed. They always exceed my expectations. They are musical pioneers who have wonderfully endured and consistently set the bar higher and higher.

0307346617|5.0|World War Z is a surprisingly mature look into zombies. Not a phase I ever thought I'd use, but, in the case of Max Brooks' excellent 'oral history', it is surprisingly accurate.    Brooks has essentially written the definitive collection of zombie-related short stories - exploring the walking (shambling, crawling, etc) dead in a variety of scenarios - different places, different times, different protagonists. You name it, Brooks has chucked a zombie into it.    His unusual - and successful - authorial decision is to frame the book as an oral history. Kind of like Studs Terkel or even Garrison Keillor, except with more devouring-of-brains. As a result, what should be a collection of cheesy, set-piece tales becomes something surprisingly insightful and character-driven. Although his set-ups are magnificently imaginative, it is the consistent use of empathetic narrators that really makes the book a success.    This is an excellent, ground-breaking, must-read addition - not only to the popular zombie sub-genre, but to horror as a whole. Brooks successfully uses characters to drive great story-telling - a lesson from which many authors could learn.
B001TWT0AE|4.0|On the surface, this black-and-white western from director John Ford looks like a \\"B\\" movie.  It's long, often overacted and the direction is sloppy.  Yet, because of its storyline and the forthright message that it conveys, the 1962 release  is one of the most memorable films of Ford's illustrious career.<br /><br />James Stewart plays a well-meaning, albeit naive, lawyer from the East, who arrives in the small western town of Shinbone and immediately comes up against nefarious gunman Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin).  Valance has been terrorizing the community with nobody around to stop him.  In fact, the only man around capable of standing up to him is rancher John Wayne, but Valance has wisely avoided this confrontation.<br /><br />Stewart, however, pushes for justice.  With the encouragement of waitress Vera Miles, who Wayne is also courting, and the help of newspaper editor Edmond O'Brien, he campaigns for statehood, which Valance opposes.  Then, on one fateful night, violence erupts in Shinbone, and the non-violent Stewart must meet Valance in the street with a gun in his hand.<br /><br />This is the sort of moment from which legends are born, but if the true facts and the legend disagree, then as John Ford tells us, \\"Print the legend.\\"<br /><br />It makes one wonder how much of the world's \\"official\\" history is more legend than fact.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B000P12LWY|4.0|Okay so this is junk TV at its best.  It's like those gossip magazines that I love reading while I'm waiting in the grocery store line.  I know the stories are probably false but I still read them for the entertainment value.  The writers intended this series to be loosely based on historical references, but some of the scandals, major background events, and characters are fact.  In real life, Henry VIII was already in his 40s when he met Anne who was just in her teens.  He wasn't the hot and steamy Jonathan Rhys Meyers which I won't argue against.  People who are complaining about the historical inaccuracy of this show, go watch PBS or the History Channel instead.  The ads for this show have cleavages and sex plastered all over, so it's clearly expected that the storyline needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The script is still very well written despite all the fabrications and sexcapades.  Season 2 and 3 are even better!

I can tell where the retro-thrash bands get their inspiration to do long solos. all in all a combination of brutality and melody.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This four-hour Masterpiece Theater production is an excellent adaptation of a great story.  It is written, directed, and acted exceptionally well.  The cinematography is beautiful and very evocative of what I'd pictured when I first read the novel.  The miniseries is especially well-cast.  Ruth Wilson is the perfect Jane Eyre--smart, funny, self-reliant--and had me rooting for her character throughout the entire movie.  Toby Stephens is fantastic at showing Mr. Rochester's charming side, as well as his gruffness and loneliness.  The story is gripping, and this production had me seeing images of it in my mind long after I first watched it.

0452286751|5.0|This book is not a joy to read.  It isn't fun, happy, or uplifting.  Indeed, most of it is oppressively dark and disturbing.  It is however, masterfully written and very rewarding.  Not as captivating or inspiring as [[ASIN:0525948929 Atlas Shrugged]], this book still ranks as one of my all time favorites.  Definitely recommended to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />THE FOUNTAINHEAD follows a central cast of extremely memorable (but not generally likeable) characters through a story that's main purpose is to highlight and demonstrate Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophies.  All of the characters represent extreme personalities (and are thus rather one-dimensional).  The self-confidant, unreliant, productive man (Howard Roark) battles the worst of society's altruistic and self-sacrificing demands.  The socialist progressive movement is the enemy, excusing weakness, stupidity, and laziness; while demagoguing production, achievement, and individualism.  This book actually provides a mastermind antagonist in Ellsworth Toohey that knowingly strives for the downfall of civilization by promoting liberalism, and is one of the most intriguing, but unlikely, characters in Rand's novels.  Dominique Francon, Peter Keating, and Gail Wynand all contribute to make this story truly unforgettable.<br /><br />IMO, Rand is one of the most ill-represented and misunderstood philosophers of all time.  Rather than being radical, I believe that she would fit right in with current day Libertarians.  She was not heartless or without compassion, she just understood that living for yourself is the way to peace.  She didn't dislike charities, she disliked the government forcing people to give up their property for the benefit of others.  Paying welfare taxes does not equate to kindness or charitable giving when it is done under coercion.  Stating that no man has a right to others' property does not reflect selfishness, but an understanding of natural law.<br /><br />Rand was a huge believer in America, and its promise to the future.  She wrote these books and developed her philosophies to combat what she saw as the liberalization of America and the world.  Many of us today see and fear the same things even now.  A couple of my favorite quotes demonstrating Rand's love of this country and nicely summarizing the theme of her two best books:<br /><br />\\".. built on the principle of individualism.  This, our country.  The noblest country in the history of men.  The country of greatest achievement, greatest prosperity, greatest freedom.  This country was not based on selfless service, sacrifice, renunciation or any precept of altruism.  It was based on man's right to the pursuit of happiness.  His own happiness.  Not anyone else's.

142312166X|4.0|Prologue and Disclaimer:  Having read books 1-4 of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, with the final book 5 ([[ASIN:1423101472 The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson & the Olympians, Book 5)]], which I just received and am reading now, YAY!) on order, and being a completist at heart (yes, I also bought the Tales of Beetle the bard (both versions! [[ASIN:0956010903 The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Collector's Edition (Offered Exclusively by Amazon)]] and [[ASIN:0545128285 The Tales of Beedle the Bard, Standard Edition]]) and the Artemis Fowl Files [[ASIN:078683675X Artemis Fowl Files, The]], I knew that I had to get this companion book for the Percy Jackson series as well.  And since I also bought the other short story books, I knew going in that I'd be paying a premium for a hardcover book with less than 200 pages.  But hey, it costs about as much as a ticket for a 2 hour movie, and lasted at least that long, so I'm not complaining!    So, the book comes with 3 short stories, a few 2-3 page \\"interviews\\", 8 color portraits of characters from the book, a crossword puzzle and a wordsearch puzzle, plus about one-third of chapter 1 of book 5.    Timelinewise, all 3 short stories occur between books 4 and 5, based on the age and knowledge of the characters involved.    The first story involves Clarissa and Percy (a unique pairing, compared with the other books).  I liked the dynamic between the two, but wasn't crazy about the way Clarissa seemed so depending on Percy, instead of being able to carry her own weight more.    The second story was with Beckendorf (of Camp Haephestus) and Percy, later joined by Annabeth and Selina of Camp Aphrodite.  Without going into too much detail, I wasn't crazy about the plausiblity of this story.  I know, it's a fantasy book about greek gods, but the story had one of the characters reattach a mechanical head that was chewed off, back onto it's body, without tools, and get the robot working again, all in about an hour and a half.  The third short story was the best of the bunch, and seemed almost like a missing chapter of book 4, since the repercussions of that story may affect book 5 (I haven't finished book 5 yet, so I don't know if it will).  The story revolves around Percy, Thalia, and Nico, so if you know about those characters, you definitely know the significance of those three to the storyline.    The interviews, color portraits, and puzzles were filler material, interesting to those who look for that stuff.    The excerpt of book 5, namely, the part of Chapter 1, was short but tantalizingly informative.  A budding potential romance, a prelude to war, and a bag of greek fire, what more can you wish for?    I still have to say something about the price point for this book.  The MSRP of this is a bit steep, even for a hardcover, when you compare it to the other companion/short story books (namely the Tales of Beetle the Bard and Artemis Fowl Files as comparison).    Overall, 4 out of 5 stars.  I recommend buying it if you are a completist and need to read it before reading book 5 (like me).      UPDATE: 05/11/09  I've since read book 5 ([[ASIN:1423101472 The Last Olympian (Percy Jackson & the Olympians, Book 5)]]), and can unfortunately confirm that the final book makes no reference to the 3 short stories in this book.  It's as if these short stories never existed.  A shame, really, makes me have to think of the short stories as \\"what if\\" scenarios, as opposed to including them into the whole Percy Jackson timeline.
0062502182|1.0|I'm a modern spiritual person.  I read, I meditate, even chant.  But I listened to this unabridged book during lunch breaks, and kept thinking how shallow and repetitious it is.  How many cliches can a person put on a single page without embarrassment?  \\"Follow Your Personal Legend,\\" \\"Listen to your Heart,\\" et al.  Maybe the original Spanish is more artful, but it came off like a cartoon on the Christian channel.
B001FB4W02|5.0|In my opinion season eight is one of the best seasons of the smallville series.  Lana bites the dust   Kara departs forever  Lex gets blown to bits  Oliver is discovered having difficulties in deciphering the dichotomy of good and evil  Jimmy tries to take on doomsday single handedly  Chloe finds herself in a very precarious position with the doomsday character  Clark faces a new threat in Doomsday. Smallville does an excellent job of the doomsday character
B001FBSMW6|1.0|I purposely did not listen to the songs from the 3rd CD online because I wanted it to be a suprise. I felt I knew it would be amazing like the first 2. Under the Iron Sea is one of my favorite CDs of all time. I only like 2 or 3 tracks on Perfect Symmetry but I wouldn't even say like.. more like I can tolerate 2 or 3 songs. Wow... what a huge letdown. I hate it when a band tries to make a \\"new sound\\" and fail miserably. I think maybe they switched audiences or something.. because I'm just not feeling this 3rd album AT ALL.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|Really wanted to like this. But after watching it, I can only say this:<br /><br />It's looooooooooong.<br /><br />It's Forrest Gump in reverse, only without the grand spectacle or sense of historical involvement or human connection. It has no soul. The reverse aging is a gimmick with no real purpose or meaning.<br /><br />At the end, you get the feeling that not much has happened, and slowly.<br /><br />I admit it has great visuals and effects and sense of period, but to what end? Each event and encounter left me wondering, so what? Who cares?<br /><br />Forrest Gump's adventures and interactions showed us how silly we are, or how shallow, or how much better we could be, or what was important in life. Benjamin's, on the other hand, don't seem to point to anything at all - it's empty. In the end, nothing has been accomplished apart from an expensive exercise in backwards-aging Brad Pitt; you feel that you have gained nothing and experienced nothing.<br /><br />No, wait. There is one thing to be gained, near the end, when he's a kid again, demanding his breakfast. He uses a vulgarity but the scene - all of 4 seconds - is hilarious (and sad at the same time). But that hardly makes up for 3 hours of nothing.
B001TOD92C|3.0|I like Rourke (showing some rough miles in the face, but built like a bull) and Tomei (getting older, but still a hottie) and they do great with what they have to work with.  I think the script could have been better and the storyline drags throughout the first half of the film, with the exception of the graphic wrestling scenes, of which there are too few. You want this character to turn things around and just as he starts to see a bit of light on the horizon, life and/or his own irresponsible behavior takes away his chance to succeed in his effort to connect with the three loves of his life: wrestling, Tomei (the \\"girlfriend\\"), and Wood (the daughter), and in that order. The movie is good, even without a Hollywood ending, but it could have been great with a little more meat in the script and storyline.
1423101472|5.0|Rick Riordan's final book in the Percy Jackson series does not disappoint. The Last Olympian is a tour de force of battles, intrigue, love and ???     Don't worry, no spoilers here.    As he has done in his other books in the series, Mr. Riordan combines his knowledge of Greek mythology with a fine understanding of young people to create a book that will draw you in, hold your attention to the last and leave you begging for more.     Percy again battles the forces of the ancient Lord Kronos along with his friends from past adventures. For a time, enemies become allies; and, just like in any \\"mortal\\" family, everyone must work together to bring the story to its satisfying conclusion.     Boy-oneder's favorite character is Tyson. Sonshine's favorite is Mrs. O'Leary. As always, I am drawn to Annabeth. However, all of the characters are so well drawn as to seem real in the moment. Riordan's writing makes them jump off the page straight into our imaginations. He made me laugh out loud. He made us cheer. And the best part is: There's more to come!    Go buy this book. Buy lots of them and give them to every kid you know. That recommendation that says this is for ages 10 and up ... phooey. Give them to everyone. Read them with your kids. Give them to libraries. Read them with other peoples' kids. ENJOY!

B000002J09|1.0|Let me start by stating what an absolute waste of time and brain cells it would be to review this album track by track. The only other exercise I can conceive of that would be as gratuitous a task would be of course to actually listen to it track by track. This one is, as we all know, Led Zeppelin's masterpiece. It has nearly 1,000 total reviews and over 750 5 star ratings, which begs the obvious question: How can 750+ people all be this stupid? Well I have noticed an inordinate number of spelling errors amongst the Zep fans here, even when it comes to the group's own songs. Lots of \\"Immagrant Song\\"'s for example, which is particularly embarrassing given that it's written before them both on Amazon and on the cd. But this isn't about the fans or belittling their intellectual credentials or lack there of. This would have to be a five part essay bare minimum if it were.<br /><br />I want to take the opportunity to sum up every momentous aspect of what makes up the venerable and fierce Led Zeppelin. I will put it in a nutshell because that's where it belongs.<br /><br />In October 1967 a child named Rob Van Winkle was born. Undoubtedly, no one knew that great things lay ahead for this wee lad. 22 years later, Mr. Van Winkle is all grown up and has become a pop star, or rather more accurately a rap star. If the name doesn't sound familiar to you, he is perhaps better known as his rap stage name, \\"Vanilla Ice\\". I'll wager that even Zeppelin fans, notoriously elderly and likely approaching the advanced stages of senility, have heard of hip-hopper extraordinaire \\"Vanilla Ice\\". Now, I'm not Vanilla's biographer and I don't claim to know much about the sad man other than the obvious. He was a talentless hack influenced by a style of music that he had no ability to build upon, only mimick very badly and he caught the attention of some puppeteer in the music business. To make a short story (his career) even shorter, he proceeded to greedily devour every common rap lyrical theme and musical idea and then regurgitate this pilfered material to a white, middle class audience. He was watered down. He was a fraud. He was a hack, but he was white and so the music that he stole had a ready made audience. At the time, white rappers were a novelty and also probably more user friendly to a white, suburban audience. We all know Vanilla bit the dust hard and has had his face kicked in it ever since, but his mentor, the man at whose feet he must have studied, is still a revered rock God. Why?<br /><br />Now I don't know personally what Mr. Ice's feelings about Led Zeppelin are. I'm merely speculating that as a young man he must have taken notes at Robert Plant's masterful ability to imitate black musicians and churn out third rate, derivative material to a musically uninformed, white audience. Robert Plant was Vanilla Ice before there was Vanilla Ice. This is your legacy.<br /><br />\\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is consistently voted greatest rock song on virtually any \\"classic rock\\" radio station under the sun. This is a problem for anyone who recoils at the words \\"classic rock\\" because it's invariably linked with the worst aspects of 70's masturbatory rock. This is a point no doubt lost on Zeppelin fans, but having such a \\"great band\\" played inbetween hacks like Foreigner and Whitesnake would make me re-evaluate the way I thought of them. Maybe that's the problem. Led Zeppelin gave birth to heavy metal in all it's various and sad guises. It also gave birth to the uninspired corporate rock of acts like Foreigner (lyrical preoccupations much like Robert Plant, always on women and sex). This is your legacy!<br /><br />I couldn't help but notice that the most helpful review on this disgrace of an album was written by someone who actually referred to the opening lines of \\"Black Dog\\" as \\"immortal\\". Truly awe-inspiring is the fan's ability to go beyond forgiving lyrical ineptitude and actually attempt to dress it up as something masterful. \\"Black Dog\\" is everythingthat's absolute rubbish about Zep and more. A Blues pilfered piece of music with by now obligatory guitar tinkering from Page. It of course features the customary wailing and blues 101 lyrics from Robert Plant. An example: \\"hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby, dubi dubi dubi dubi wah\\". Brilliant. Plant, who was working himself up to near orgasmic frenzy throughout the song must have decided to let the listener know what it sounds like when he finally climaxes. Much of Zep's music was that way. Plant apparently simulating masturbation as he screeches and squeals like a mangy alleycat in heat. This is your legacy?ore.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|i love every song on this album it is so touching and Avril is one of the best.and the words are perfect very rocky punky i like all of them.
B000002J03|1.0|I've heard it said before. If there was a rock and roll equivalent of Mount Rushmore then surely four lads from the United Kingdom known collectively as Led Zeppelin would  have their faces (for better or worse) gracing the mighty rock. I can even sort of picture it now. Jimmy Page, perhaps chiseled into the rock with a slightly sallow, greenish complexion compliments of some condition picked up from another misspent night with another misplaced hypodermic. Bonzo Bonham, bloated, face like a bowling ball to reflect the many pounds his poor frame endured from chronic alcohol abuse. Robert Plant, head full of dirty blonde, unruly hair, and perhaps the goatee he's taken to sporting in recent days which makes him look like an even lamer version of Sammy Hagar. John Paul Jones, can anyone even remember what John Paul Jones looks like? Neither can I.    It is with not a little awe and certainly a handful of piety that one should gaze upon this collection of washed up ex-junkies, ex-boozers, ex-hippies. Unfortunately the only thing that hasn't been \\"ex-ed\\" out yet is the fact that they still insist on trying to make new music. They are for some inexplicable reason, venerated as the Gods of Rock by sundry music lovers. Sadly, unlike most people's more traditional personal gods, whether it be Yahweh, Allah, Christ, or whatever, they refuse to stay out of sight and more importantly, out of sound.     40 years ago, this ragged, unkempt parade of wanna-be's unleashed their second effort in which they successfully exported someone else's ideas to a mass audience. In the case of their particular passion, the blues, they offered absolutely nothing of consequence to a style that had been performed decades before by Black American musicians. I wish to compare and contrast a terrible, shameless band of no depth or orgnality like Led Zeppelin and their treatment of the blues (perhaps better said, their thievery of the blues) with someone who also took as his foundation, blues music, but unlike Zep, he made it his own. I apologize in advance because I'm going to be referring to a very literary and intelligent songwriter and this is anathema to Zeppelin fans. Not to mention it will likely strain their comprehension skills to breaking point.    If we compare Led Zeppelin's embarrassing plundering of the blues style on their first two albums, it should strike any informed fan as the pathetic meanderings of a talentless gang of rip-offs inundating the senses with something that is derived 100% from a sound and style that was decades old at the time. One cannot over-emphasize the word \\"derivative\\" enough. It conjures up images of exactly what they are and excel in, hack job replicas, completely second rate, but much more commercial than the original articles they have plundered. The very first track on here was partially nicked from a blues player born in the 1910's called Willie Dixon. As a person who is not fond of the blues played either by the orginal generators of it or their sad rip-off's, I find it uninspiring lyrically and usually dull muscially. The lengthy wailing guitar solo's are simply tedious. However, compare Zep's copycat act with Australian singer/songwriter Nick Cave's first two albums and you will see that they weren't only separated physically by miles and miles, but that Cave is light years beyond them in terms of orginality, intellect, and just simple talent.     Now I'm sure that Zep fans are arduously scratching their heads at the name Nick Cave and aside from the reverberation of the usual empty clinging sound, are at a loss. Cave's first two albums came out in 1984 and 1985. Several years after Zeppelin and he is several years younger as well. It may seem unfair to compare artists that far apart in time, but if it was possible to use the blues as your starting point and still manage to create your own style, it would have been easier to do it in Zep's time. By 1984, the blues was even older, even more plundered by Zep and their sad acolytes. Cave managed to do it then simply because he had something Page and company never will. Brains, talent, skill, ingenuity, creativity, artistry, etc.    Musically Cave and the Bad Seeds entailed four musicians like Led Zeppelin. Unlike Zep however, this quartet who did use blues as their starting point, created something unique and original in spite of the fact. While Jimmy Page abuses his instrument with more frustration and indulgence than a pimply geek on prom night on virtually every song, you'll find not a single guitar solo on either of Cave's first two albums. Not one. Why? Because it's dull, because it's derivative, because it means **** all to anyone who isn't themselves a pretentious white flop trying to ape the blues. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is ripped off from blues man Wille Dixon, and it's clear. It has about as much uniqueness as any other Zep song on the first two albums, which is to say, none. Lengthy, mind numbingly dull guitar solos and a drummer likely in an alcoholic haze struggling to keep the beat. Cave's \\"Tupelo\\" employs minimal instrumentation, it is virtually the bass alone that propels the song along eerily as Cave prophesies the doom that lay ahead for the inhabitants of the birthplace of the King. I'd love to see the hacks in Zeppelin create a song that is driven by little else but the bass guitar, but at this point I'd settle for a Zep song that didn't have a pathetic pseudo-bluesy guitar solo. \\"Saint Huck\\" is another that is propelled largely by an eerie bass line and again a demented Cave detailing the doomed Huck's venture from the river to the city. \\"From her To Eternity\\" most prominently contains crashing keyboards as well as a rivetting bass. Throughout, the guitar is hardly noticeable, much less aped to the point of fawning adulation as Jimmy Page excels in.    Music aside, perhaps the biggest contradiction is in the lyrics. Whereas Robert Plant appears to have the mind of a petulant child perpetually p*ssing and moaning over matters of the libido (matters one suspects he lacks the maturity to even understand) Cave expands in a unique and original way on elements of blues that were always there. Plant takes elements that were always there in blues lyrics and pretty much regurgitates them verbatim to a white audience (with cutomary orgasmic yelp of course). Cave takes the themes common in blues music, melancholia, despair, hopelessness, bad luck, and then precedes to elevate them to a higher, more literary, adult level. Cave's lyrics explore religion and God and those that they have condemned. They explore dirty death row floors, the psychosis of a broken and jilted lover, the mythology of evil symbols and figures and what it is claimed they foretell. Loneliness, isolation, despair, abandonment by God and/or man, all elevated to a level that is then crammed down the listener's throat with violent assaults of voice and sparse instrumentation. There's not a lot of electric guitar on those first two Cave albums and there's many tracks when the drums are either absent or tame, but this combination contains within it approximately 1000 times more force and power than the \\"pedal to the medal\\" pseudo-energy of Led Zeppelin. Perhaps Zep had to be harder and faster in an effort to conceal how truly unoriginal and derivative these guys are. Perhaps it had to be harder and faster to conceal that the Emperor indeed has no clothes on.

Please think very seriously about your choices, because God is watching us all, and while He DOES give us freedom of choice, He's still in charge, and we'll all have to answer to Him one day.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|OK, so this band had potential for a killer CD based on their prior recordings, but it falls short.  There are maybe 3 songs that are good to great and the rest just sound like rip offs of those same songs.  This CD is boring and I just cant listen to the whole things without taking it out with a yawn.  Good band that needs to work a little more on making an ENTIRE CD filled with great songs.  I really dont get how this is dubbed Southern Rock?  Its just soft, EMO music that would have Lynard Skynard kill themselves if they were told they were in the same genre.

We sat together and picked which one we would draw, and we painted for one full hour. He liked it, so did I.     The book uses very basic shapes that kids can understand and control, such as shape of letter, squre etc... It was easy enough for my 5 years old to understand and follow. However, if your kids have great sense of art, let them go free drawing.

B001S86J1C|5.0|This review is for the Blu-Ray edition.     Ferris Bueller's Day Off is directed by John Hughes. The film stars Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jeffrey Jones, Jennifer Grey, Charlie Sheen, Ben Stein, Richard Edson, and Edie McClurg. Contributors to the musical score include Ira Newborn, Arthur Baker, and John Robie.    Ferris Bueller is a Chicago high school student who, like so many others, is sick and tired of long, boring school days. So he comes up with the ultimate plan - fake an illness to get out of going to school, and use that day to get together with his friend s, and do everything fun the city has to offer. Once he is up and about, he teams up with his girlfriend and his reluctant, constantly depressed and nervous buddy. And borrowing the latter's father's priceless sports car, the trio heads downtown to partake of numerous activities. But what Ferris doesn't know is that the school's dean is aware of his less-than-stellar attendance habits, and is out to bust him by any means necessary.    The movie is a classic - one of those few eighties movies that really stands the test of time, and never manages to feel dated. Prior to shifting over to the world of family-friendly cinema, John Hughes was the master of teenage angst films. And perhaps no movie he ever participated in demonstrates that more than this one. There are laughs to be experienced around every corner, and yet the film is never raunchy or explicit. It's a success on every level.    Ferris Bueller's Day Off's cast is one of the greatest assets the film has going for it. Matthew Broderick brilliantly portrays the title character. Always entertaining and always lovable, Brod erick's performance here is arguably the finest of his career. The other stand-out is Alan Ruck as Cameron, Ferris' always-fearful companion from a broken home. Other great performances include Jennifer Grey as the title-character's uptight sister, Jeffrey Jones as the high school's over-the-top dean who will stop atnothing to bring Ferris down, and Edie McClurg as the dean's goofy secretary. Some brief (but no less memorable) performances include Ben Stein as the boring, monotone economics instructor, Charlie Sheen as a drug addict in a police station, and former Sonic Youth member Richard Edson as a crooked parking attendant. The movie is filled with excellent performances.     Alongside its cast, another great thing the film has going for it is the storyline, and the way the film explores it. It's a simple, to-the-point storyline so many people can relate to - who among us all hasn't wanted to ditch school for the sake of having a great day? The trio goes all across the city, and the comical scenes never stop. The tone of the film is perfect - always comical and entertaining, yet never raunchy or explicit.     Music for the film is composed by multiple composers. Amongst them is Ira Newborn, who would also compose the music for numerous other films/shows/artists/etc, including the Naked Gun films. The songs featured in the film come from a variety of sources and cover numerous genres - each one of which always suiting a certain scene in the film perfectly. Sadly though, John Hughes refused to release a soundtrack album, as he felt the songs wouldn't work well together as an album. As such, many songs featured prominently in the film, including the Flowerpot Men classic Beat City, are now highly sought after. Great music.... I only wish there was a soundtrack that had it all together!     This is one of those movies where I'd been waiting for the Blu-Ray for a long time - after all, it's one of the greatest films of the eighties. And let me be the first to tell you this Blu-Ray transfer does not disappoint. It's not the best vintage film transfer I've seen in HD, but it's certainly above average, given what I've seen for other films of the same era. Detail throughout the presentation is sharp, and there is an enhanced amount of detail I couldn't see in any old DVD presentation of the film. The grain level is consistent, and never interferes with the viewing process. My only real complaint image-wise is that a few shots look too soft , and some facial textures lack depth. Still, a small complaint. A lossless audio track only sweetens the deal, bringing the dialogue and widely-diverse musical score to life like never before. All in all, Ferris Bueller's Day Off on Blu-Ray shouldn't disappoint.     Special Features: This is a straight-up port of the Bueller Bueller Edition DVD, so all of the same features are present here. There are various making-of and other vintage featurettes detailing the creation of this classic film, as well as a photo gallery. Disappointingly, everything is presented in standard definition. Still, it is a nice variety of bonus material and I'm grateful we got anything on the disc at all. I wasn't expecting all the features from the previous DVD release, so this actually comes as a pleasant surprise.     One complaint I must make, however - like the Bueller Bueller edition DVD, this version of the movie DOES NOT include the John Hughes commentary from the original DVD release. I don't see how hard it would have been to slap it on the Blu-Ray port.      All in all, Ferris Bueller's Day Off stands the test of time, and this Blu-Ray is the new definitive version of the movie on the market. The movie itself doesn't fail to please, and a great transfer makes this package all the more appealing. If you've got a Blu-Ray player, steal your dad's prized Ferrari, rush to the nearest store, and pick up this disc.

B001R10BM8|4.0|Never Say Never Again is an unofficial, non-EON Bond film that was released in 1983, directed by Irvin Kershner. The film stars Sean Connery, Kim Basinger, Edward Fox, Max Von Sydow, Alec McCowan, Bernie Casey, and Klaus Maria Brandauer. The musical score is composed by Michel LeGrand, and the title tune is sung by Lani Hall.     A little history lesson for the unfamiliar. In the late 50s, Ian Fleming had written several James Bond novels, and was desperately trying to make a film out of one of them. These attempts never quite worked and were met with skepticism, so Fleming teamed up with Kevin McClory, a brilliant writer. The two created a screenplay, but Fleming had it turned into the next Bond Novel (Thunderball) at the=2 0insistence of his publishers. This caused McClory to start a series of legal battles that continued well after Fleming's death, and even rambled on in some shape or form until McClory's death in 2006. McClory won the rights to make his own Bond film after ten years from Thunderball's theatrical release had elapsed. What resulted was 1983's Never Say Never Again, an unofficial, non-EON film that brought Sean Connery back to the role. The title was a joke on Connery saying he would \\"Never Again\\" play Bond (this story may not be a hundred percent accurate and may omit some major details, but it should give you a general idea of how this film came to be.)    It is also due to McClory's owning the rights to the SPECTRE organization and the Blofeld character that they never appeared in most of the post-60s Bond films.     As you probably guessed, the plot is more-or-less identical to Thunderball. Bond heads down to the islands to foil a SPECTRE plot, which involves the terror organization hijacking nuclear weapons and holding the world hostage. Bond has aged, and is more of an instructor than anything now - but following a health spa visit, he finds some intriguing details that lead him straight into the fire. Teaming up with long-time CIA buddy Felix Leiter, Bond sets out to deal with SPECTRE by any means necessary.    This film gets a bad reputation for no good reason. Just because it's not an official EON production doesn't make it an inferior work. Hell, it's better than at least half of the EON movies. Sean Connery plays Bond here very well, despite his age, and actually puts a new and interesting spin on the character, making him more human. He seems to want to retire and even (gasp!) eventually settle down with his leading lady. There are some g reat performances here, and it's great to see that this take on the Thunderball story makes Felix Leiter, played brilliantly here by Bernie Casey, a more important character (see? Casino Royale wasn't the first film to feature an African-American Felix Leiter!) Yes, some scenes do feel a bit dated, and in a few areas it lacks the classic Bond touch only EON could do.    But all in all, this is a more-than-worthy Bond title. Doesn't quite rise to the heights of the sixties Bonds, or even the original Thunderball, but it's better than just about anything that came after, including nearly every Roger Moore film. The film came out the same year as Octopussy, and while that film grossed more, Never Say Never Again is by far the superior movie. It was great to see Connery get one last shot at glory, and he does it nicely. Strongly recommended, Never Say Never Again gets 4 stars out of 5 (though I wouldn't put this one quite as high on the Bond pedestal as most the EON films I give 4 stars to. Do esn't mean it's not great though.)    Let me start by saying that Never Say Never Again, as an unofficial film, never got the Lowry Digital Images treatment that the official movies did. As such, home video releases of the movie have always been hit-and-miss affairs. This marks the first attempt to actually make the movie look decent, and for the most part, it succeeds. There's some print damage and dirt here and there, and grain does spike heavily in a few scenes. Likewise, the increased definition makes blue screen a nd rear projection work all the more obvious. But as a whole, this is the best Never Say Never Again has ever looked and sounded, and given its nature and history, it isn't likely it will ever get a better transfer than this. There's more good than bad points about the transfer, though.      Again, not an abundance of material here since it's not an official film and has never been given the Ultimate Edition treatment. But unlike older versions of the film, at least there is SOME bonus content here. Director Irvin Kershner (you may remember him as the director of The Empire Strikes Back, the finest film in the Star Wars series) and a Bond historian team up for a commentary, which is an enlightening listen. Four featurettes are included, while short they re a worthwhile view for the film. Topping it all off is a photo gallery. No, not a great collection of features, but I'm glad they bothered putting anything on here. It's at least an improvement over the bare-bones releases of the movie we've endured for so long.      Don't say \\"Never\\" to when you'll watch this film. Official or unofficial, it's a damn good classic Bond picture. Connery's last outing as 007 is an underrated classic that is waiting to be discovered, or in some cases, rediscovered. Don't pass this one by.

0812550757|5.0|\\"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.\\"     Speaker for the Dead is an unusual novel--it crosses lines back and forth between fantasy, science fiction, spirituality, psychology, philosophy, history--there is no genre for this book. While Ender's Game is an intense work, it is clearly what it is. As much as I enjoyed Ender's Game, I like Speaker for the Dead more because it is undefinable; and yet, it is clear as day.    Orson Scott Card must be an incredible person, because when I read his introductions to both Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, I felt like he was inviting me into his home. We had a fantastic conversation through these introductions as he explained to me the genesis of the works and issued me a blanket invitation to make the stories my own!    Imagine my astonishment when I realized--more than 24 hours after having finished Speaker for the Dead--that I actually accepted his invitation. I identified so completely with Ender in his struggles and his pain that I marvelled--I don't usually empathize with a character so completely, so wholeheartedly.    I can see how a million separate, individual stories can be spun from these works--they are profoundly introspective. Underneath it all, however, is the desire for healing from brokenness. In some way, we are each broken, and in some capacity, our Creator has enabled us to have the ability to soothe, and through His ability, to even heal each other's brokenness. After reading Speaker for the Dead it crystallized for me in a new way that there exists a Christian mandate to speak healing for others' hurts.     Card explained in his introduction Ender's desire to move beyond his personal adolescent stage and to step into a role of anchoring, but I think Card overachieved his goal, and gave us a glimpse into the potential that adults have as heroesin stories--as anchors. We see many, many novels about brokenness, but rarely do we see stories of healing. I doubt there are many skilled authors capable of presenting this kind of reversal. However, it is so much more interesting as a story, and much more fulfilling for the reader.    Of course, I only touched on one small aspect of the story. The creativity is teeming over, but it never gets *weird.* It is refreshing without getting bizarre. Cliches are avoided, but I recognized how completely Card was an influence on Stephenie Meyer's writing.     This is not a work for everyone, but it is a work for anyone who wants to read it. I do recommend that Ender's Game is read first, as it is the first part of the story. Highly recommended.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|Depeche Mode is a survivor and has kept creating full studio albums long after many of their peer bands dissolved. This album and the last (Playing the Angel) are a continuation of the journey and reflects the entry into middle-age. Those people looking for songs like \\"Lie to Me\\" and other very sexually charged songs need to go back and listen to DM's earlier work when these men were much younger and compelled to write those kinds of songs. Sounds of the Universe has a lot of steady patterns with the feeling of deep movement (example: \\"Come Back\\") and going somewhere with the patience (and weariness) of age. Its a bold stare into the void which can develop (much akin to outer space) when one looks at the other side of the life cycle. To do it right you can't have the young more energetic and poppy DM without the darker, slower, more mature DM, it gives the band/project a life of its own and more purpose and meaning. I personally thank DM for continuing to make work and offer up such great songs for the enjoyment of us all.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Short answer: Yes! Longer answer: I was 13 on the day this was released as a 2 record set,I got it and \\"Mark, Don, & Mel\\" together,and the only thing on my turntable for the next 2 months were they. Decades later,the cassette for my car. Then my son bought his own CD copy in the 90s. After researching DSD, I decided to let my ears decide for themselves.  On a Harmon Kardon receiver,Sony SACD player, with Yamaha home theater speakers I sat back...Wow ! Crystal clear,like I was in the studio. I'm 50 now so I can't take this technology for granted,I'm in awe of it, and more importantly,am grateful for it. Waiting 16 years for the RIGHT way to remaster was the right move ABKCO !
1423101472|5.0|What can I say, Rick Riordan has yet to disappoint. This last book was an excellent read and just as entertaining and clever as the previous books of the series. While Riordan definitely leaves the opportunity at the end to continue this story in some way (new and/or old characters being the focus) I feel that everything he had left hanging throughout the series was definitely concluded in some reasonable way as to satisfy even the most dedicated fans. I highly recommend this book (and the entire series) to anyone who enjoys fantasy, is into Greek mythology, or just needs a good laugh. Excellent work, Riordan!!
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|Time passes smoothly with this long, uniquely premised movie which is a testament to the directors, actors, script writers and editors. But, for the audience it's a roller coaster ride viewing experience. It vacillates between being profound with it's (Fitzgerald's) thoughts on life & death and being wearisomely mundane (long journeys on tugboats & motorcycles) and unbelievable (souls becoming hummingbirds at sea). So, I give it an average of 3 stars.
0894803123|5.0|What a great ice cream book!  I have several other ice cream cookbooks (williams/sonoma, etc) and this is by far the best.  THe ice cream is delicious, instructions are clear, recipies have basic ingredients. I have used both my kitchen aid & cuisinart 2 quart makers and they both work well.  Great chocolate & vanilla base recipies to add what ever to your heart's content!  No leeche nut/ tofu/ low fat stuff in here...butterfat at it's best...Enjoy!
0316044695|5.0|So when it comes to books, I'm always the first to start one and the first to put it down for good about 30 pages in.  I'm well educated, but I guess I have that adult attention deficit disorder or something.  This ensures two things.  I won't finish a book unless it's very good and I don't have any chance of ever becoming a Navy SEAL.  This book not only takes you through Mr. Luttrell's terrible ordeal, but also gives you the detailed journey of the 1 percenter and the special type of person it takes to become a SEAL.  That is a very rare person.  If you are fascinated by these unique soldiers, this book will not disappoint.      This book also describes not only the people \\"over there\\", but how the political decisions made from desks over here can affect the lives of our brave men and women willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.    I am sure this review didn't do this book enough justice.  It took me four days to read this book.  I couldn't put it down.  That says a lot, given my history of finishing books.    Lastly, a big thank you to all of the soldiers who have allowed me the opportunity to write this review.  Freedom isn't free and I know it.    Buy the book!
B0015AARJI|4.0|I bought this control as a gift for my boyfriend because of his Gran Turismo game.

And as far as I can tell, he enjoys using it.
0671799320|5.0|Mr. Yergin's book is a superbly written account of the impact of oil upon our global economy and way of life.         I never knew oil would be so essential towards economic and strategic concerns.  The one fact that burned into my brain is the energy content of oil versus coal for warships during World War I.  Ships burning oil instead of coal had more powerful engines while saving space and man-power.  I don't recollect the figure, but it was staggering to realize an oil-fueled ship, say a British cruiser, could have as much firepower  (after deducting weight and space for the bigger ship) as a coal-fueled German battleship.  Oil is the stuff of victory.  Akin to Frank Herbert's literary object \\"Spice\\" in his Dune series, alliances and treaties mean nothing to nations when struggling for a secure source of oil.        To understand the importance of oil is to also understand how vulnerable oil-dependent countries are against suppliers, dwindling supply, and the politics involved in protecting the flow of oil products.          Realizing the implications of oil-dependency should be an important part of our future public education cirriculum.

0316010669|5.0|As I read this book, I could not help but feeling a sense of deja vu.  Many of the concepts and examples that Gladwell presents have parallels in my own experiences.  The knowledge that something is the right choice even before being able to consider all the circumstances can be both liberating and troubling in that you can spend as much effort second-guessing yourself as plodding through the decision process.  In that manner, I really enjoyed the book as it seemed to reinforce that one could indeed experience effective thinking without thinking about it.  However, I can also understand the negative reviews as well.  The experience and enjoyment of the book can really be related in the old saw, \\"for those that have, no explanation is required - for those that can not, no explanation is possible.\\"

0061684384|5.0|\\"Celebrities\\" often have ghost writers create books to cash-in on their fame. The books often lack substance or purpose -- neither is the case with this entertaining, well-constructed book. Clearly she did not delegate the task to anyone else, and this book screams Kat Von D on each and every page.<br /><br />I imagine she fought more than a few battles to have an end product of such uniqueness and quality. The book looks great and surprisingly feels great with its embossed padded cover.  The artwork, like her tattoos, is stunning. The book is a light history of her art and touches on recognized tattoo artists in the past and the heroes of today. She explains tattoo equipment and briefly shows old and new machines. There are detailed pages of her tattoos and the art on friends and celebrities. She explores popular tattoo styles and designs and touches on their classic appeal.<br /><br />This is not my world. I have no tattoos and if not for LA Ink would never have heard of her, but make no mistake, this is a fascinating woman and a terrific book. If you've never heard of her but are curious about the art and history of tattoos this book is perfect.<br /><br />High Voltage is an accurate reflection of the person we see on her show -- a feat in and of itself. Kat Von D defines the word genuine and that honesty about who she is comes through every page of this book.  High Voltage is worth the time to read and is money well-spent.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|I ordered this movie for my daughter. She watched it a couple of times on TV and was fascinated with the story.

It is one of the best family movies we have seen.
0765342294|5.0|As a 6th grade teacher, it's very typical to have to battle with students to get them to read.  This book was the exception.  I actually had students upset when I wouldn't let them take the book home so that they could read it on their own!         I highly recommend this book to show students, rather than tell them, that reading can be an \\"experience,\\" and not just work.  I had the students write for 10 minutes after each chapter.  They were to explain why Ender felt the way he did and why.  They also needed to write how they would have felt, and why, as well.           I don't know if it was all the book, or partly the bonding of thinking about how the main character felt, or both, but EVERY student in my class was fully enveloped in this book.  When I asked them to read in groups, they read.  When I told them it was time to stop, they were upset.  When I asked a student to read for the class, they ALWAYS knew exactly where we were.  It was amazing!         The plot of the book has been described over and over, so there's no need for me to repeat it, but there are a couple things to note.  This book is not for an immature class.  The story takes place in an almost all-boy's school.  Boys from all ages attend the school, so there are things said and done that can be expected.  There are a few cuss words said throughout the book, and the mention of boys walking around naked.  However, the students get over it very quickly.  There are a few chuckles during the first couple reading sessions, but then it's no big deal to them anymore.  Actually, it may even pull them further into the book, since they feel that they're being treated unlike children during the reading.         I will read this book with a class every year I am able.  Order a class set of these.  You won't regret it!  It's the best book I've ever read with students...EVER!
B0013FYTA8|4.0|I thought that I would maybe only like 4 or 7 songs, but I like them all except Bad Girlfriend... I know all the words to it, I just don't like the lyrics that much, but every other song is awsome.
0316017922|5.0|I picked up this book in an airport for reading on a flight and immediately found it engaging and entertaining. Better, i found it informative and validating.    I have been reading a string of books in an effort to improve my business. Investing, to quadrants, to e-myths, to internet and ice cream. All very good books about making more success out of a business. But this book focuses more narrowly on the individual. This book, pleasantly not about money and business, enlightens on the underlying chance that is built into the aptitudes of successful people.    This book has given validation to the fact that I work nearly 10 hours a day, relentlessly in pursuit of success. While Kyosaki's Quadrant book and Gerber's E-Myth highlight the fact that overworking is the second most poisonous aspect of a self-employed person, Gladwell gives support to the notion that dues must be paid. Any task which most others would consider is addictive is one where there is a substantial propensity for mastery.    If you are a business person who is addicted to their business, I suggest reading all three books. Quardants for a destination focus, E-myth for a roadmap, and Outliers as encouragement that gives your self the validation you need to keep going.
B001N26GFC|1.0|We fell in love with Sally Hawkins in Jane Austin's Persuasion.  We read a review in People magazine about this movie and just couldn't wait for it to come out.  We knew we just had to have it in our video library.  We weren't five minutes into this movie when we both realized we had made a major mistake.  All I can say is that it was so awful we didn't keep it or even donate it.  It went in the trash.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Martyrs is one of the best horrors I have watched in a few years. The French have been surpassing the Americans with this particular genre lately. Although I prefer Inside to Martyrs it is right up there in the greatness factor. Some individuals feel as though you have to be sick or twisted to watch movies like these I feel completely different on the subject.I do not enjoy watching others get tortured. It just seems to bring out emotions and senses that we do not get to use in everyday life. The first part was highly intense and very frightening while the second part was just extremely brutal and over the top disturbing with a high amount of gore. Fortunately I love all horror so as long as it's great I can watch anything. Martyrs is definitely not for everyone. This is only for people who can with stand anything and I mean anything. It pushed far beyond the envelope and should not be taken lightly when going into it. If you don't like Torture Porn at it's finest then stay away from this one. In my opinion this is what Saw should have been like, even though this probably wouldn't have been made without Saw. I am not usually a fan of these types. However Martyrs is an exception to the genre. With a very small plot they still made this film very interesting. The main characters were outstanding in their roles. They never over or under acted throughout the entire film. I actually think that I can't find one thing wrong with this. Overall it was perfect. I might have toned down the severity of the kills and torture, but then again it might have made it less then it was. Sometimes over the top works well and sometimes it doesn't. In this case it worked very well.<br /><br /> A young girl by the name of Lucie gets kidnapped and tortured but somehow manages to escape the hell physically but never mentally. She befriends another young girl Anna in an orphanage who takes her under her wing. Fifteen years years later they go to pay revenge on Lucies perpetrators not realizing what hell is in store for them. You learn what it really means to suffer mentally and physically. What extreme measures people will go to to get answers.<br /><br /> I highly recommend Martyrs. Only to those who can handle extreme and over the top gore. Do not try and watch this if your not a fan of these types of films, because I guarantee you won't like it.ell is in store for them. You learn what it really means to suffer mentally and physically.

B001UREJWM|5.0|I've been reading over some of the negative reviews and if some of you are unfamiliar with Black Sabbath history you will not know that there has been a VERY longstanding rivalry between those who prefer Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne as singer and those who like Ronnie James Dio.    I enjoy both- I do have a preference for RJD but in the world of Sabbath it's all good. My point is, I would very much be willing to bet that the people who are giving this album bad reviews are the same bunch of ballyhoos who always prefer Ozzy.     This album is a great selection of tunes-very solid and catchy. Sure I could nic-pic and find something about I don't like but all in all the album is very solid. Definitely worth every penny!     My Favorite songs:  Atom and Evil  Bible Black  Double The Pain  Fear   Follow The Tears  Breaking Into Heaven
B000BZ99WY|2.0|This is a tragic story that needed to be told. Unfortunately, Dallaire should have used a ghost writer or someone like Mark Bowden to tell it. This reads just like a diary and is so burdened with needless details that the accounts of the genocide get lost in the mix. I found myself skimming whole chapters, and would put the book down for days before picking it up again. I'm capable of reading a 500 page book in 3-4 days, but it took me a month to get through this. If not for the subject matter, I wouldn't have finished it.
0316017922|3.0|This book is a pretty quick read and not necessarily worth buying.  After 30-40 minutes of skimming in your neighborhood bookstore, you will get the idea.  The author's research is not the best, I believe he cites wikipedia at some point, but his points are interesting, although somewhat obvious.  The general thesis is success requires not only some talent and some work, but a whole lot of luck, which seems pretty obvious to me, but in this world many people give themselves way too much credit.      The book is not a complete waste of time. The stories of success that the author highlights are interesting, but don't expect to read something life changing.
159448385X|5.0|This is the best book I have read in several years. Truly gripping and evokes a wide range of emotions. This is a must read for all lovers of literature. The Kite Runner was good, but Husseini takes it to another level wih Suns. I've lent this book to several friends and they all finished it in 2-3 days. What's next?
B001EN71CW|5.0|As a proviso: I'm a died in the wool Browncoat. Having said that, anyone familiar with this series will know ahead of time where this review is going.    So I'm not going to explore at length why this sci-fi series was one of the best, most engaging, plot driven, character evolved, intriguing, cross genre, series of its type of all time.  Browncoats will already know this and newbies interested enough to take the bait will discover it on their own to their delight as well as consternation that it was prematurely cancelled.  At least a follow up movie, \\"Serenity\\", was made to tie up the loose ends.    Regarding the quality of the new format, Blu-ray, I couldn't be more pleased.  Whedon purposely shot the original in 35mm film and widescreen instead of the usual 4:3 format as demanded by his short sighted overseers at Fox.  Although it was originally broadcast in 4:3 with crucial scenes composed to one side of the screen or the other, Whedon framed scenes in such a way that they could eventually be broadcast in HD.    Also, Whedon shot scenes in available light thus lending a certain grittiness to the scene in keeping with the story line.  Therefore, scenes are sometimes dark and \\"atmospheric\\" by design.  This overall effect isn't lost in HD but enhanced somehow, which sounds contradictory.  The colors are vibrant, details are rich, sound is beyond belief, without distracting from the cinema verite, film noir story itself.      I own 5 boxed sets of the Firefly series which I lend out on a regular basis to friends who've never heard of it.  At any given time, they're all lent out at once.  I will not be lending my Blu-ray version out.  It will be our \\"master copy\\" which we will continually go back to for viewing whenever there's nothing on TV or when we're waiting for our next Netflix movie to arrive.  Firefly and its followup movie \\"Serenity\\" will be our default \\"movies\\" for the duration or until a movie studio realizes the potential profits to be made from revivingit.    If enough Browncoats weigh in, then maybe we'll get more.  Thus this review.
0316017922|5.0|Reading this book made so many things in my life clearer.  I enjoyed the way it started - talking about birthdays and hockey players - then moving on to honors students.  So much of my adolescent academic issues were explained in this text.    Throughout my life big successes - the ones that provide substantial income - were always seen as being lucky.  However, the book shows me that this is not the case.  As with Bill Gates, having proper planning as well as being in the right place at the right time is what matters.  Luck is where hard work and opportunity meets.    I like the way the author writes.  It is linear and easy to follow.  The book ends with a personal touch, he speaks about how his mother paved the road for his success.  It was nice to read, almost a tribue to those who have came before him.       Its a good book - well worth the read.
0446402397|4.0|for a debut novel, \\"child 44\\" deserves every ounce of the critical acclaim it has received. it's hands-down one of the most fascinating novels i've read in a couple of years, and i'm going to be first in line to pick up smith's sophomore novel \\"the secret speech\\" due out in a couple of weeks. it's an amazing read that i simply couldn't put down...until around page 400.<br /><br />\\"child 44\\" for the most part drives with a smoothness and grace that makes it one of coolest things around, until it runs out of gas during the final 100 pages or so. at this point, it just gets plain bazaar. the story collapses from a sophisticated socio-political thriller into a cheesy, cliched screenplay-quality work with little in the way of redeemable writing. the otherwise tense action of the first 400 pages becomes little more than a series of impossibly convenient episodes (dare i say absurd) during the final push. the last fifth of the novel reads like a hurried, jumbled mess, and a tout literary debut falls out of overdrive and into a stalled-out, sputtering jalopy. i read somewhere that this novel was originally intended to be written as a film screenplay, but was later re-worked into a novel. perhaps this is the faulty mechanism.<br /><br />i only criticize it because it had true potential. despite it's major flaws, this novel is a grand debut. i have yet to form an opinion about tom rob smith. the potential for greatness is undeniably there, but the ability to follow through with a strong finish has yet to be demonstrated. i have high hopes for \\"the secret speech,\\" but another fatal flaw in the final 100 could permanently ruin this author for me.
B001GMH8RO|4.0|Patrick Swayze is convincing, even if a little too brash, but watch this film for Demi Moore, who is absolutely delicious.
B001MYIXAW|2.0|I was recently informed about how the translation done for the DVD release of this film was changed from a narrative translation to more of a literal translation, taking away some important aspects of characterization from the poetry of the language.  There are some points where the translations have characters saying things that don't even make sense the way that the wording is done.  Apparently, the distributor cheapskated out when it came to buying the translation that was shown in theaters (which was fantastic; as I saw earlier this year).  I hate to downgrade a movie that I loved so much, and the reviews on the cover are true as far as how great the film is.  This is what true horror films should all strive for.  However, the distributor really dropped the ball when a little bit of money might have gotten them much better reviews.

B00000FC5H|5.0|Earth Wind & Fire: Greatest Hits has many hits that I remember from when I was a kid in school; it brings back a lot of memories for me. This is a strong single CD compilation although as others have noted it doesn't give you every last one of their hits. However, what we do get is very high quality control music from Earth Wind & Fire; and that's great. The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that artwork, too.<br /><br />\\"Shining Star\\" rocks! This came out and hit the airwaves big time! Earth Wind & Fire simply never sounded better. They really handle this well; they never skip a beat nor do they ever let go of a superfluous note. The tempo and key changes make the number strong; and they sing this very well. \\"That's The Way Of The World\\" quickly shifts gears for a much more mellow sounding tune; this features the group squarely in the spotlight--right where they belonged and still belong! \\"That's The Way Of The World\\" was always one of my very favorite Earth Wind & Fire tunes; and I think just one listen will tell you why--this is all THAT good.<br /><br />\\"September\\" has an awesome beat that would even get the dead tapping their feet to the rhythm; \\"September\\" was yet another huge hit that got a lot of airplay when it was originally released. I still hear it sometimes on an \\"oldies\\" radio station in my area; and that's grand. \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" is one heck of a snazzy tune; they make this a masterpiece and they deliver this with a lot of feeling. In addition, \\"Sing A Song\\" has them harmonizing to perfection--and beyond! \\"Sing A Song\\" is another major hit on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Serpentine Fire\\" uses the percussion to great advantage; and of course another big hit for this group is \\"Fantasy.\\" \\"Fantasy\\" charms me with its beauty and it's truly a stand-out on this album--how could they ever get better than this? I'm amazed. \\"Mighty Mighty\\" has quite a beat that gets you up and dancing nearly wherever you are; and listen for \\"Reasons.\\" \\"Reasons\\" has a mellow, pensive flavor to it that is absolutely stunning--and the backup singers harmonize well.<br /><br />\\"Let's Groove\\" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later; and I really like \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions. \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today. \\"After The Love Has Gone\\" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing \\"Getaway.\\" \\"Getaway\\" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance; and it also leaves me wanting so much more!<br /><br />This is a great album for fans of Earth Wind & Fire, but if truth be told they would need other CDs to have all of the hits from this fantastic group. This album is particularly good for the casual fan who wants most of their hits on one single CD; and it makes an excellent starter CD for people just discovering the fine talents of Earth Wind & Fire.lavor to it that is absolutely stunning--and the backup singers harmonize well.    \\"Let's Groove\\" is another tune that still sounds good all these years later; and I really like \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" which Earth Wind & Fire performs with The Emotions. \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" was a huge success for these artists and I still love to hear it today. \\"After The Love Has Gone\\" again showcases Earth Wind & Fire at their mellow best; and the album ends strong with Earth Wind & Fire performing \\"Getaway.\\" \\"Getaway\\" has a strong beat that makes me want to dance; and it also leaves me wanting so much more!

0316067598|5.0|This is such an eye opener and gives you a first hand look at what these Wonderful soldiers have to go thru. I couldn't put the book down, and I'm a woman who you would think wouldn't like this kind of book, not true. The very fact that this is a true story keeps you on the edge of your seat thru-out the book.  I have such admiration for Marcus Luttrell and what a courageous man he is. Keep it up Marcus, I'm ready for the next book, I'm sure you have more stories in you. Give us more !  T.Williams
B001HUHBAE|4.0|This movie starts out a bit grisly,  with a couple of random murders, then transforms into a journalist/detective flic.  It has plenty of twists and turns (as expected), but because it is based upon a true story, the ending is somewhat anticlimactic.
6305744793|4.0|I think \\"fun\\" is the adjective most people would use in describing this film, which appealed to kids and adults. Of course, many adults remember the television series, and probably checked this out, too.     Angelica Huston certainly didn't match Carolyn Jones' beauty but she, along with Raul Julia, Christopher Lloyd and Christina Ricci all were entertaining to watch. There certainly were no end to the colorful characters, unique scenes and dialog, special-effects and active surround sound. It all made for an entertaining and fast-moving film.    I didn't find a lot of laugh-out-loud moments but it did bring a lot of smiles to my face. A lot of this is dark humor, so it helps to appreciate that type of comedy.
159668139X|5.0|Learning to Weave is the best book to use for learning to weave.  The instructions are clear and understandable even to a first time weaver.  I have been weaving for over 10 years and I still refer to this book whenever I start a new project.  If you are interested in learning to weave, do not hesitant - purchase this book!

I have a B3 clone and have really benefitted from this text. The book also covered many differnent styles of organ playing which was an added bonus.
1423101472|5.0|I've read this series since it first came out. It generated the same buzz as the Harry Potter series, and in some ways it was better. Certainly it has a coherent mythology, is believable and is well written. This last book truly brings the series to a well rounded end, but we lose a lot of characters. This is not a good series for an eight or nine year old. There is too much loss and some scary images. This is an ideal series for the teen and adult. I would strongly recommend the series.
B0000844M8|5.0|I showed this video to a group of high school students and it was \\"new\\" for all of them. They were all entranced with it and it is just so nice to view a great movie without worring about language or other inappropriate content.

B000WC39XQ|5.0|This movie is very creepy. A teenaged girl named Carrie White is always being picked on and made fun by the sexy teenaged girls. (Her psycho God-crazed mom doesn't help.) The girls even threw towels at her while she was crying and having her period. When the gym teacher; Miss Collins sees this happening, she forbids them to go to the prom. Sue Snell, who was throwing towels felt bad and told her boyfriend, Tommy Ross to take Carrie to the prom. Chris Hargensen, one of the girls who hates Carrie plans a terrible revenge that involves pig's blood and asks her boyfriend Billy Nolan to help her. Prom night; Carrie and Tommy are having a wonderful time and (for some reason) win prom King and Queen. After they celebrate, the blood is dropped on Carrie, and the bucket drops on Tommy's head and kills him. Soon, everybody laughs. What Chris and Billy didn't know was that Carrie had telekinesis and uses her powers to kill just about everyone in the gym. Later, Carrie's mom tries to kill her, but Carrie kills her mom and their house falls in and kills Carrie also. The very end with Sue putting the flowers on Carrie's grave and a bloody hand pops up is awesome. Hell, the whole movie is awesome. I would love to take Carrie to the prom. If you love horror, revenge, and proms, you'll love CARRIE!!!
1416979174|1.0|I am a big Eric Carle fan, and am stunned and saddened that he would put his name on this book.      1.) It does not portray the life cycle of a seed correctly at all. I would definitely not use this in the classroom, or as a tool to teach my child about seeds/plants.  (Seeds don't catch on fire by flying too close to the sun, and flowers don't grow taller than houses in my neighborhood.) 2.) It is not good for pre-schoolers.  Don't laugh, but it's too violent.  All these seeds are killed off one by one -- frozen, burned, eaten, drowned.  3.) The lackluster illustrations are not up to the standard we expect from Eric Carle. 4.) Lastly, I'm not sure how more adequately I can describe this book than by just saying, \\"This is one really weird book.\\"      It appears to have gotten some good reviews, so it might be a fit for some people out there.  But, in my own opinion, it seems to me as though it was slapped together on a tight deadline, and with the thinking that by simply putting the Eric Carle name on it, people would buy it.  (Unfortunate people like me.)  Stick with the tried-and-true \\"Hungry Caterpillar\\" and \\"Brown Bear\\" classics if you want Eric Carle.  And look elsewhere if you want a book that teaches kids about the life cycle of plants, like \\"This is the Sunflower\\" or \\"Bob and Otto.\\"
0131103628|4.0|I am reading this book, becasue it is a computer programming classic. It has good examples and it does not hold your hand too much. That being said it is some what dated. The second edition is over 20 years old. So do not use it as the gospel, especially if you are using C 99. Good book and a must read classic if you are into UNIX and C.
B000002INR|5.0|Had this album in tape but wanted to listen to it so I looked for cd.  I got a great deal it came nice and in great fast shipping.
B0013USZHG|5.0|I love this disk, but the title and jacket may mislead. This is not a CD full of salsa/samba/mambo music. It has some elements of those, but most of the music selections have more European influence (think Villa-Lobos, although he is not represented on this disk). The opening number is very evocative of modern Amazonian music (Uakti in particular) and is both engaging and disturbing at the same time. Considering that it based on a poem entitled \\"Chant to Kill A Snake\\", the music is indeed a tone poem straight from the jungle. It made my cats, who are otherwise blase about music, run around the living room and act crazy. The other selections, as noted, have more European influence, with nods to Gershwin, Ravel and Debussy. I'm not being ethnocentric here, but just trying to present some comparisons that will be familiar to American listeners. All of these selections made me want to hear more from these composers and the orchestra.The concluding number is a live performance of the dance \\"Mambo\\" from West Side Story. It made what's left of my hair stand on end; Somewhere,(pun intended) I know Bernstein is smiling in appreciation. Highly, highly recommended!

B001NESPHC|5.0|I randomly discovered Melody Gardot through the Rhapsody music service, and boy am I glad! To my simple taste, she is superior to Norah Jones, Madeleine Peyroux, and even Diana Krall (whose latest efforts have been disappointing). Just so you know my bias, I am a die hard Diana Krall fan. If you like Diana Krall's earlier work, you will probably like this album.    \\"My One and Only Thrill\\" is a very warm, poetic and lyrical album, with a level of originality and sophistication you rarely hear in vocal jazz. There is also a refreshing hint of youthfulness in her voice. Even \\"Over the Rainbow\\" sounds fresh.    Melody Gardot is now one of my favorite artists, and I just wish she had more albums! Her earlier album is also wonderful, do check it out! She does live up to her name :)
B001N44BVQ|3.0|Enjoyable romp, if somewhat unbelieveable at times, hard to think the Jordanian secret service is more effective than the CIA, but may be it is! Russell Crowe is brilliant at the seedy off the wall CIA controller, Leo is a bit over the top and basically appears to be reprising his Blood Diamond role.
0553381407|5.0|I thought that I was the only person in the world who had suffered this kind of abuse, indignity, pain & humiliation; all at the hands of my parents. And of course later at the hands of many, many, many, many different persons. I kept trying to figure out why everyone was so mean to me--why that world was filled with so many horrible people and then this book helped me to realize that I was choosing the types of people that I had been surrounding myself with. I was attracted to the same types of people that possesed my parents qualities!     This book opened my eyes and showed me that I am not alone. It is truly a God-Send for me.    Toxic Parents helped me to recognize the destructive patterns that I had exhibited for years and years and offered tangible, hands-on solutions that helped me to re-program my thinking and way of life. What I love most about this book is that it does not blame and shame abused persons rather, it offers ways to empower ourselves by letting us know that whatever we need to do to become healthy and happy (short of physically hurting ourselves or others) is okay.    This book helped to give me a voice and the courage to take an honest look and my life and change it for the better. I no longer have to spend my life running away from what happened to me instead, I am empowered with tools and the courage to look at it square in that face and move forward.    I originally purched this book a few years ago via a recommendation from a friend and am now in the process of re-reading it. I'm going to purchase a copy of it for someone I love today and hope that it helps her the way that it has helped me.     I recommend this book to anyone who is sick and tired of being sick and tired. Even if you don't consider yourself \\"abused\\" I belive that reading this book would be beneficial.
0385339682|4.0|This was a great book!  Although very different than Grisham's other novels, it was a terrific, quick and insightful read that I highly recommend.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|This album sounds way too generic and lacks liveliness and energy. Especially when compared with \\"Live in Paris\\" which to me is Diana Krall's best work.<br /><br />Her last 2-3 albums have been larger arrangements or experiments away from the \\"great American songbook\\" which, alas, are not successful. Diana Krall is best when working with a smaller set of musicians or solo piano. She has been kind of going downhill to the point where a hard core fan like me no longer anticipates new albums eagerly. This album is completely skippable.<br /><br />If you like Diana Krall (especially the older records), try Melody Gardot, who is a rising star at least on par with Diana if not better.
B001P9KR94|4.0|Not sure i would have voted this film to win the Oscar, but a good movie all the same, the scenes in the Mumbai slums with the younger kids are very real and believeable, the relationship between the two brothers later on, less so. But overall an interesting ang enjoyable film to watch.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural is a terrific show. Creepy, funny, and always entertaining. Sometimes the writing leaves something to be desired, but most of the wrinkles have been ironed out by the third season and the acting is excellent. Highly recommended!
B00005JLEX|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the dumbest most overrated shows in the history of television.  All the characters do is repeat the same lines over+over again.  Larry David needs massive amounts of serious therapy.  Michael Richards is 20th rate Robin Williams+the rest of the cast is just as bad.  Basically the 4 main characters are narcissistic,self absorbed whiners who the planet would be better without.  I would give this 0 stars if I could
B0007GAEGC|2.0|Maybe it isn't their fault are the problems I have with their presentation and singing voices a problem I have with this group specifically or the way in which music is headed in general?  Wailing into the microphone with the same inflection doesn't remind me of good Irish/Celtic music it reminds me of an Irish Springs commercial.       Its not that the group can't sing its just that they don't sing very well in comparison to at least 5 other better Celtic groups.  Their rendition of whatever song they are singing is fine but the Chieftains sang it better and if they didn't the Dubliners did.  Maybe at some point this group will improve but I rather doubt it.        The difference is a question of media machines; too much of their presentation is just preaching to the choir with something like PBS behind you there is no need to improve your performance because the people who are watching you or buying your CDs would have done so anyway.  They will also stay on your side until the next new thing comes along anyway.
B001NFNFNA|4.0|A rivetting and absorbing film, made all the more effective by the fact that it is a true story. It kept my attention throughout. Jolie is really impressive as a vulnerable, but ultimately determined mother and is entirely believeable.  How did they hide the tatoos????
0930289234|3.0|I could say I love Watchmen. I love the story, the characters, Moore is indeed a great writer.<br />I COULD say it. But I will not, because of one detail...<br />I started flinching in the Mars chapter. It was too much pseudo-science and cheap philosophy for me.<br />They say it's easy to create an overwhelmingly powerful character ,what is hard is to create an amusing, quirky, appealing one.<br />I agree to a certain extent. It's very hard to roleplay a very smart character, whose intelligence far exceeds the writer's. And Moore had an epic failure here. I could buy the cliche explanation for Manhattan's origins (accidents, as always), but I would never buy an almost omniscient being fighting in Vietnam - specially NOT as a giant blue godzilla - or being unable to automatically win the Cold War. Come on, he could teleport to Russia and kill soviet leaderships.<br />If he cared about all this (and he ceases caring at a certain point, which i appreciated), he would, instead of playing Mr US Military Puppet, self-declare world leader and unite the world, materializing food out of thin air and using his powers to aid humanity.<br />When you want to create a godlike persona in a realistic world, you must be able to convince the reader. And Manhattan's science, philophy, intelligence, and, most important, motivations, are dull and unbuyable.<br />The God Ex Machina gran finale, then, is a complete shame.<br />Despite all this, I liked Watchmen. I would give it 5/5, if there were no blue smurf to spoil all the fun.

I haven't enjoyed a book this much in months!  It's definitely on par with other great fantasy books I've read from George Martin and Scott Lynch.  If you enjoy those authors, I predict you'll like Joe Abercrombie just as much!  This is the first book in the trilogy, and the other two are just as good!  BUY THIS if you're looking for a great series of books to lose yourself in!
B000087HXN|5.0|This was the bomb back in the day.  When it came out in 1977 everyone was playing it and I mean everyone.  You could hear on boom boxes in black hoods, white hoods, hispanic, german, italian, and so on.  Trans Europe Express exploded on African American radio stations.  It was the coolest thing back then even though we weren't very familiar with techno music back then.  It still sounds great even today.  This album brings back great memories.  You must have this in your collection especially if you collect old school music.

1934030198|3.0|I am a regular 3 a week gym workout kind of guy (4 years now) who recently decided to get into endurance sports. Unfortunately I received minimal information from this book. I was looking for insider information on technique and multisport workout do's and don't, but ended up reading mostly about theory. The 1st 40 pages or so were purely on attitude, commitment and what it takes or something of the kind. Barely anything concrete on multisports. I did find a couple of useful pages on different training theories and technique itself, but only minimal. Don't mean to trash this book, but it just did not meet my expectations.
015206057X|2.0|I want to love this book. The pictures are adorable, the babies are multi-cultural, the text flows beautifully, and the message about babies being basically the same wherever they are born is important. But I can't love this book, because apparently \\"everyone\\" is not aware that limb abnormalities occur in 2.6 out of 10,000 births in the U.S. In a nation of 300 million, that adds up to plenty of people, myself included. When the hook of this text is that \\"everyone knows\\" that \\"ALL of these babies\\" are born with 10 fingers and 10 toes, a refrain used repeatedly, that is not a book I want to share with my 4-yr-old. I don't want to confuse him, because HE knows someone without 10 fingers, and this book will give the impression that I am the only one in the entire world for whom that is true.    I feel similarly about books that teach kids that \\"we ALL\\" see with our eyes and hear with our ears. No, not ALL of us do. I wish the authors could have found something else that all of these babies had in common, because \\"everyone knows\\" that it's difficult enough to teach kids about the differences in people without books like this making those differences seem even more strange and abnormal.
1439138311|3.0|This is a well paced story about a young woman from Ireland trying to make a life for herself in Brooklyn leaving behind her beloved sister Rose and her mother. Eilis Lacey is smart and hard working and has an unflagging advocate in Father Flood, the priest who sponsored her and found her a job and a room in a boarding house for single women.<br /><br />Eilis is initially homesick in this new environment. Her landlady is bossy and meddlesome, and she has little in common with the other boarders - a couple of uptight spinsters and some party girls. She eventually adjusts to life on her own as she starts taking night classes and meets a young man at one of the parish's Friday night socials. Though happier than she was during those first days, Eilis still finds her new life tedious as she works long hours on the sales floor of a department store. Also, things are proceeding faster than she would like with her new boyfriend, Tony, who is already talking about marriage and children after only a few months. She likes him but doesn't know that she wants that kind of commitment so soon.<br /><br />The story alludes to the racial tensions of the times as Eilis works in a department store that makes a controversial decision to start serving Black customers. Also, the characters briefly discuss some of the prevailing stereotypes about Irish and Italian people.<br /><br />Things come to a head after a tragedy occurs back home and Eilis is unable to return in time for a funeral. She decides to go home for a visit and realizes how much she's changed and considers staying there instead of going back to Brooklyn. Her mother wants her to stay. She's been offered a job, and there is a young man who is suddenly very interested in the new Americanized Eilis. Though she is tempted to stay, Eilis made an impulsive decision before she left and will have to deal with that should she decide to remain in Ireland.<br /><br />Like many young women, Eilis does not want to disappoint anyone and spends a great deal of time trying to make other people happy from her sister Rose, to her annoying landlady to her boyfriend Tony who seems to have their life all planned out and later her demanding mother. In the end the decision to return to America is made for her after a local gossip confronts her about her relationship with Tony who she'd kept secret from her mother. The ending of the novel is a bit unsatisfying because it's rather abrupt. but this was a good book overall.trying to make other people happy from her sister Rose, to her annoying landlady to her boyfriend Tony who seems to have their life all planned out and later her demanding mother.

076781326X|3.0|I love this movie, but cannot understand why it has to be broken into two segments. You have to turn the disc over to watch the second half. I understand the need to do this in the early days of DVD - but now with dual layer discs, this is no longer needed. This disc is marketd as remastered, but is basically the same as the original release.

B0012IX38K|5.0|Jason Bourne is the man in the middle without the perks of a James Bond.  Matt Damon brings the character to life.  Movie magic also helps, but Matt Damon really helps the movie come to life.  With no thought for his safety or future, Jason Bourne is the Good Soldier.  He follows orders.  And then, his life is reborn, The Bourne Identity, and he begins to learn the truth of his life.  Would that each of us could discover who we are and be able to rewrite our history.  A great portrayal by a great actor.  A must see and must have movie for any action buff.  Highly recommended.

0786162678|4.0|I have fairly recently read Pride & Prejudice and Sense & Sensibility and really enjoyed those two books and decided to give Emma a try.  As with Austen's other major characters, Emma has many wonderful characteristics, but she also has some flaws that are the cause of most of her problems.  It was fun to see how she got herself into trouble time and again due to some pride and a tendency to meddle in others lives.<br /><br />Austen has a very good ability to bring out peoples strengths and weaknesses without sounding preachy.  This is one of the things I enjoy about great literature; I am able to learn from the characters and see how I may have some of their weaknesses and resolve to do better.<br /><br />The audio book was read by Nadia May.  I thought she did a good job, but I do wish the characterizations were a bit more distinct.  I had a hard time telling which character was speaking during portions of the dialog.  I've been spoiled listening to other audio books where the characters voices are so distinct that it is very easy to tell them apart.  This is the reason I gave 4 stars for this audio book instead of 5.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book, though I would search for another reader who did more distinct characterizations.

Enjoy!!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|A great movie for Matt Damon.  Jason Bourne is best seen by acquiring the whole set.  This is part two of three.  Get the set.  Learn the secret behind the program that Jason Bourne was the initial start of.  The invisible government has soldiers.  This is the \\"fictional\\" story of one of them.  I recommend this, but get the set.
0345441184|5.0|Amazing that I haven't read this book long before.  I really enjoyed the re-telling of King Arthur, Mordred and all that.  I like that it's from a woman's point of view.  I can understand why people say this book is a classic.
B00229NGYY|5.0|The Last of the Mohicans is a grand, sweeping epic romantic adventure that - in the original theatrical version at least - deserves its reputation as a modern classic.     Openly based as much on the now rarely seen Randolph Scott version from 1936 as on James Fenimore Cooper's novel, the scale is genuinely spectacular and the pacing spot-on, making for one of the most exciting and well-crafted pictures of the 90s. Despite the surface absurdity of casting and English actor and an American actress as respectively American and English characters (though in the novel Cora was actually Scottish, Madeline Stowe thankfully doesn't try the accent), the performances are well drawn. Daniel Day Lewis makes a classical hero in every sense of the word, but the supporting cast also manage to bring surprising depth to their roles. Steve Waddington, as the fiancé uneasily caught between loyalty to his country and to his own code of honour and Maurice Roeves' Colonel Munro are never duplicitous stereotypes, and, like Wes Studi's vengeful Magua and French director Patrice Chereau's outwardly humane yet slightly ambiguous French General Montcalm, never feel like mere ciphers there only to advance the story. Even Jodhi May, most of whose part got lost during the famously unpleasant shoot, manages to convey more with a single look than many actors can with a monologue. Everyone has their own valid reasons for their actions.     There is for once a real sense of time and place around the characters. The historical subtext of a nation moving towards revolution through the callous indifference of its distant government is woven into the narrative without overpowering it. The seeds of the American War of Independence and the end of Empire are hinted at and the complexity of the Colonial wars is used to add to the central drama rather than detract from it.     Unlike the empty stylistics of Miami Vice or the spectacularly self-conscious botched job of The Keep, here Michael Mann adopts a classical style that serves the story well. His use of long shots and long takes rather than close-ups and rapid-fire cutting combines with excellent production and costume design to not only create a convincing world but give you the time to get drawn into it.     The Scope composition is outstanding, using every inch and aspect of the frame to stunning effect. This is a film you really do need to see in widescreen, true CINEMA-Scope with no compensations made to the small screen. Scenes like the parlay between the English and French armies are not only robbed of their epic scale in fullframe but also of their sense of pace - with the peripheral action lost, the huge crowd scene is reduced to four men talking in a field. Dane Spinotti and Doug Milsome's photography is so sumptuous it makes the cold, flat, grainy look of Mann's recent digitally shot features look all the more disappointing, its use of reds and earth tones creating a vivid frontier world that is both visually and dramatically satisfying.     The only caveat is that some of the scoring (by no fewer than four composers) seems badly spotted and in the wrong place: despite strong work from Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman's underappreciated contribution, it is tempting to imagine cues being switched to different scenes to greater effect. Certainly the inclusion of a Clannad song actively works against the scene it accompanies and feels like a half-hearted commercial move.     A work of intelligence and emotion, if you love adventure movies this definitely deserves a place in your collection. However, be warned that while the UK PAL edition is the original and superior theatrical version of the film (with isolated score and theatrical trailer the only extras), the NTSC version is Michael Mann's director's cut - and quite a mess he's made of it, hacking away at sections that worked beautifully to make room for scenes that add little and losing much of the flavour and character of the original. Although the cut has a bit more action, it has a lot less heart and becomes rather a chore to sit through, so stick to the UK release.

0312370849|1.0|I am about 2/3 of the way through this book...I've only read thus far because so many people recommended it to me.  The writing is so simplistic, so juvenile...maybe aimed at a 6th 7th grade level?  I've just gotten to the part where the French farm couple decide to accompany Sarah to Paris to help her find the brother she left hiding in the secret cupboard.  So, let's go back...Sarah and her family are caught in the round-up in Paris, held in atrocious conditions in the Vel D'Hiv, taken to the camps and separated...all very tragic events that were all too real.  BUT THEN, she escapes the camp with the help of a kindly(are you kidding me?) French policeman (the same one who shaved her head AFTER he enforced the round-up)...oh, and he also gives her a fistful of money.  She is taken in by a wonderful French couple who clean her in a hot, soapy bath, put her to sleep in a soft, warm bed covered with thick comforters, feed her hot, delicious, nourishing food, cry over her (even though they've only known her for hours), risk their own lives by lying to the Nazis AND then finally decide to accompany her to Paris. Yes, history shows that there were many \\"righteous Gentiles\\" who aided and abetted the escape of so many Jewish children but PUH-Leeze...how could so many wonderful opportunities appear for this young woman? Even though I detest reading this far into a book and NOT finishing, that's what I'm going to do.  This is a waste of my reading time!  Its just not believable at all!  Read Nemirovsky's books or Mila 18 or Eva or the classic Diary of Ann Frank but don't expect to have a literary experience of the Holocaust in this book.
B0018PH3L0|3.0|Conventional wisdom had it that the Western was dead when after years of false starts, Lonesome Dove finally made it to the screen. Starting life as a 1971 screenplay for John Wayne, James Stewart and Henry Fonda before becoming a best-selling Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, it was even briefly mooted as a possible vehicle for Redford and Newman as the two former Texas Rangers who go on one last cattle drive, but was deemed too risky for the big screen. The end result was certainly worth the long wait, earning huge ratings and a well-deserved reputation as one of the finest television Westerns ever made.     True, the first episode is a bit slow as the characters mull over the wisdom of a cattle drive at their time of life, but the time spent getting to know the large ensemble pays off: by the time they leave the dead-end town of Lonesome Dove we know enough about them to genuinely care about their fate over the long and dangerous journey, giving us a Western that's not only thrilling but often genuinely touching. It's a beautifully produced saga, with fine performances from most of the cast - particularly Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones - strikingly directed, often breathtakingly shot and boasting one of Basil Poledouris' most beautiful scores.     So why only three stars? Well, unfortunately though the original DVD release needed remastering, this new edition rather botches the job. The picture quality is better, but unforgiveably the image has been cropped from its original fullframe to widescreen, making a travesty of the original framing and often losing detail in several scenes. So, for the time being at least, the choice is between a poor older edition in the right ratio or a clearer image but less of it on this new edition. A real crying shame...

074325144X|1.0|I thought this book was pretty much a waste of time. A good friend of mine who is a practitioner of Chinese medicine recommended the book to me because he knows I'm a runner. He told me a little bit of what the book talks about before I bought it. Honestly, I got more out of that conversation about the book than I got out of the book itself. Turns out, I already practice \\"chi-running.\\" The basic idea is to be aware of your breathing and your body while you run and work on having good form. Yeah, thanks, I learned that in high school cross country, except without the unnecessary baggage of eastern philosophy that Dreyer packages with the obvious running advice he gives.
074325144X|5.0|I love this book as a running companion!  It has great incite on the bio-mechanics of running and teaches people to run more efficiently and how to run injury free for life.  I personally learned a lot from this book and having suffered from shin-splints in previous years, I have been running pain free after adopting the Chi Running Method.    The only thing I didn't like about this book was his chapter on nutrition.  As an endurance runner, you need to fuel yourself properly before, during, and after any run.  I found Danny Dreyer's advice to be quite lacking and impractical.  Use this book to improve your running and not your diet.  Performance Nutrition for Runners by Matt Fitzgerald is a great choice for nutrition advice.

0061438294|4.0|This book is a great introduction in the study of NonVerbal Communication. The book is clearly organized and is able to communicate the intendend message. This book sell's its ideas quite well. It was also to see the author's sources cited in the back of the book.    The biggest issue I had with this book is that the author seems to show boat his previous work experence. I understand that being able to prove one's self is important but it seems that the author choose to keep referring back to how he saw such and such reaction out of a single individual and that it ended up being the only thing to break a case. The reader believes the author to be authoritative when he or she buys the book.     This book is not a complete work but an introduction to the field. The book will not tell you how to perfect your communication skills with your partner, or how to win everything in your wildest dreams. This book will help you understand potential physical clues into what the person you are communicating with actually be thinking.
006135323X|5.0|This is a great book and fun to read even if your idea of fun is not reading a book on behavioral economics. This is a great book for anyone interested in business or success. Ariely has some valuable insights into how behavioral economics influences our lives.  We all prefer an offer that is free or has something free attached, even if the other offer is actually better. He also did a very interesting study in which people's behavior when aroused sexually does not relate well to their stated values in a non-aroused state.  Another study I found enlightening is that we overvalue the things we own and as anyone who has \\"downsized\\" their home can tell you it is very hard to go back. Lastly, when you present an offer it is great for the customer to have options that are easily comparable and put the one you really want people to select in the middle.

B001U0HBQ0|5.0|\\"I was born under unusual circumstances...\\"  The curious case of Benjamin Button is something very different, very surreal. Told from the perspective of an old child, who becomes a young man, the story is about life and, most importantly, death. Exposing the viewer to the different views that people have on others who are \\"different,\\" one can see how Benjamin (Bradd Pitt) is affected by all of the events surrounding his unusual birth. Living in an elderly retirement home, Benjamin is shown how death is constantly affecting the life of many people. People come, and they go. Of course, this film is not only about the glooms of life, but also about love. In the eyes of Benjamin, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) is his perfect damsel. The intriguing part of the story-telling is how the couple come to meet in different points of their lives. Seeing their relationship grow is certainly peculiar, an old man, who is a child, falling in love with those gorgeous blue eyes. This film is not just that, but rather a fusion of art and movie making. The cinematography, the editing, the pacing, the music, it all comes together, woven in perfection, creating a world where there is bad, but plenty of goodness and love. Director David Fincher knows how to get his audience what they want, an amazing story with incredible acting and pacing. By the time the credits roll, we realize that we were taken on a journey, full of life, death, love, and most importantly, that no matter who you are, life treats you the same. This is a film for the ages, one that will be studied for many years to come.   5 out of 5.  The Blu-Ray:  Whoa! As soon as I saw those buttons falling, forming the Paramount and WB logos, I was stunned. From the get-go, this film is reference material on Blu-Ray. All of the special effects, CGI or prosthetic, looked impeccable, and this Blu-Ray helps boast these effects at home. There are no artifacts or any blemishes, considering the films was shot on digital cameras. Perfect picturequality!  The audio is another great aspect of this BD. A talky film, dialogue is always prioritized, but when the rears need to kick in, they do. Bass is powerful, when need be, and the subtle atmospheric effects are always present. A wonderful DTS-HD MA mix. Overall, a solid, demo-worthy disc, courtesy of Criterion. This is easily a contender for Blu-Ray disc of the year. Kudos to the team of Benjamin Button.
B001AQO46E|5.0|I agree with the 2 reviews on True Lies. Fox should be ashamed because all it really tells us is A MARKETING PLOT to make fans wait to long for a great movie like this to be released on Blu Ray. Why is it that from all the big companies Fox has many titles that are not (Anamorphic: Enhanced for widescreen TV's)    Are they laughing at us? Come on get real. Take a look at many low budget or crappy titles out there that get released anamorphic or on blu ray faster than the big titles. We don't want to wait until we get grey hair to enjoy the new technology available. FOX you disappoint us big time!  IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP.

0452289963|3.0|At first I found A New Earth ponderous and dense. I tried on several occasions to get through the first chapter and then gave up and did a bit of spot reading. That helped, but still it was tough going. Determined to find out what so many erudite people found so enlightening about it, I downloaded it to my iPod and listened to it while traveling back and forth to work. That's when the light came on.<br /><br />While I still found the work to be a bit dense and somewhat of a compilation of repackaged ideas from spiritual leaders and their followers, I was able to find much food for thought. For instance, I found the comparison between clock time and psychological time to be interesting. I even picked up a new phrase, the isness of the present moment. Tolle's reminder that \\"this too will pass\\" struck a responsive chord, not because it was a new idea to me but because of his emphasis on the transience of even positive, joyful, ecstatic present moments.<br /><br />While I didn't agree with every concept in the book, I must admit that they were attention-grabbing. For instance, the pain body as a \\"semiautonomous energy-form that lives within most human beings\\" is interesting. To think that this entity made primarily of emotion can renew itself, feed on our thoughts, be affected by the media, and can sometimes go into hibernation is mind boggling.<br /><br />If you want to become free of the pain-body, be reminded of many teachings from Christ and Buddha, come across quotations from such greats as Emerson and Jung, or learn to live more fully in the \\"now,\\" then read this book. While I don't agree with everything Tolle wrote, there are pearls there for everyone who takes the time to read...or to listen.

0312539517|3.0|Mallory versus Chomolungma (Everest)  I am ambivalent about Mr. Jeffery Archer's Paths of Glory.  As a docu-novel biography of Everest mountaineer George Mallory, I found it difficult at times to separate fact from fiction.  Written in the typical easy flowing Archer style, much of the first half of the book was turgid and I found myself skimming from either lack of interest or boredom coupled with wondering what was fact, extrapolated fact, and what was fiction.  The second half of the \\"novel\\" was more engrossing and captured my interest as Mr. Archer built to an interesting conclusion.  Was George Mallory the first to climb Mt Everest before falling to his death?  We may never know, but according to Jeffery Archer, Mallory and Sandy Irvine did for one brief moment stand on top of the world, June 8th 1924.  How they accomplished this incredible feat is the true mystery that Archer attempts to unravel in Paths of Glory.  Interesting biographical character development.  Only cursorily familiar with George Mallory, I found it hard to separate fact from fiction but nevertheless learned a great deal about the man and the times he lived in.  I also enjoyed reading about George Mallory's major competitor the irascible Australian mountaineer George Finch.  Both men were fast friends although at times Finch tested that friendship.  Mallory's devoted marriage was also of interest.  A lukewarm recommend.  Best to wait for the paperback or get the hardback at your local library unless of course you are a devotee of Jeffery Archer.  Not one of his best books but interesting nonetheless.

B001TOD92C|5.0|I saw \\"THE WRESTLER\\" twice in theaters and bought it the day of release on DVD. I am always blown away every time I put it on. Having been and still am a HUGE wrestling fan for over twenty years, I'm in my thirties now and my dad took me to my first matches at the age of three or four I believe that qualifys me to be somewhat of an expert on this subject. I have seen first hand the majority of the situations in this movie, I've had the chance to meet some of the greatest wrestlers in the world, and they have always spoken candidly when asked the right questions, names such as Booker T, RVD and the late great Eddie Guerrero and Owen Hart (RIP, you are missed) They all shared the same feelings..\\"we love our fans and miss our families.\\"  On behalf of all the fans around the world, I thank you and your families for the sacrifices made to entertain the masses..     On to the movie...    SACRIFICE, for my money, there is not a single human being that CANNOT identify with this story.  Have you ever missed you kid's birthday? Hated your boss or job? Been too out of it to go to work or said, \\"Man, I wish I had the chance to do it over again?\\" There are definitely similarities in the Randy/Cassidy/Stephanie relationship to the Rocky/Adrian/Robert characters ( See Rocky III and Rocky Balboa respectively) One more shot at glory, how bad do you want it? As far as wrestling being \\"fake\\", take a chance and watch these people train, for real and you'll walk away with a new appreciation for it. I did. Its like boot camp! You wouldn't believe the physical abuse the go through to \\"pretend\\" they're hurting each other, why do you think every week they say \\"DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME?\\"     Watch the movie, then ask yourself \\"Is it all fake?\\" To quote the words of a very famous wrestler: \\"IT'S REAL..IT'S DAMN REAL!\\"     P.S. I strongly suggest at some point, you view Barry Blaustein's \\"Beyond The Mat\\" as well, it will be a real eye-opener![[ASIN:B000189DZE Beyond the Mat (Unrated Director's Cut) (Ringside Special Edition)]]
B00004T9VY|5.0|This obviously great album is even greater with the remastered Deluxe Edition that came out in 2008. The extra tracks are worthwhile, consisting of live performances, demos and outtakes on a second dic. The sound also received a new 24 bit remaster and is more open and clear than this single disc 2000 remaster. Note: The same comments apply to Teaser and the Firecat, Steven's other great masterpiece from this era.

B001G0LBZ6|5.0|Keeping this review short and stout, like the film itself, this doubly disc CD to Juno is just as quirky and as funny as the film.    Everything you expect plus a few extra surprises are here.  If you are a fan of the film (like myself) you will easily find yourself Karaoke singing to the tracks.    What more to love, than to easily find all the quirkiness of the movie, that you are left wanting more.

B001TI9N7I|4.0|Mikael Bloomkvist, a Swedish financial journalist, is convicted of committing libel against a powerful and manipulating businessman, Hans-Eric Wennerstr&ouml;m.  As he awaits the start of his jail sentence, Bloomkvist is approached by Henrik Vanger, an aging industrialist and is hired to investigate the disappearance of Vagner's niece, Harriet.  Harriet went missing forty years ago from the family's small island village. Teamed up with Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric and tattooed computer hacker, Bloomkvist begins to delve into the Vanger family history.  They uncover a horrid past littered with abuse, lies, and murder. The storyline of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO was a little slow at first, but it quickly reveals itself to be an amazing story that any fan of mystery would love. The characters are powerful and the story line, once it picked up, was faced paced and thrilling. Fortunately, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is the first of a Millennium trilogy. Unfortunately,THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE (2009 release), and CASTLES IN THE SKY (2010 release) are the last books written before Larsson died of a heart attack in 2004. All three have become international best sellers. I anxiously and impatiently await the release of the rest of the trilogy here in the U.S.
1416549447|5.0|I was lucky enough to discover ChiRunning in 2004, shortly after the first edition of the book was published.  Learning to run with more efficent form ended 25 years of knee pain for me known as Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITB). With ChiRunning, I learned to engage my core properly which reduced the side-to-side motion of my hips.  This in turn relieved the extra stress on my ITB and eliminated the rubbing on the outer part of my knee.  In the new edition of ChiRunning, Danny Dreyer has added an in depth section on running injuries called \\"Troubleshooting: Injury Prevention and Recovery.\\" All common running injuries and their related form issues are addressed including ITB syndrome, shin splints, achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, groin pulls, hamstring pain, calf pulls and soreness, and other knee, ankle and foot pain.  Chapter four on the \\"Basic Components of Technique\\" and Chapter five on \\"How to Learn ChiRunning\\" are also greatly expanded in the new edition.  Step by step lessons and additional pictures clearly explain and illustrate the ChiRunning technique.

I've watched the concert several times already to admire every details; the fabulous lighting and camera angles and of course the wonderful orchestra. I don't have surround sound but I hear the DTS is out of this world. It makes me want to spend money to upgrade :-)  I also bought a boxset for my mother for Mother's Day.

B001HN697M|4.0|The only people who seemed to be upset with this movie are the ones who obviously hadn't seen the previews. It was advertised as the prequel to the Underworld movies. It was advertised as the movie about the events before the other two Underworld movies. So there was obviously no real surprises if you have seen the other two movies. But that wasn't the point. It was meant to bring the story around full circle and give you a personal view of Sonja and Lucien. I loved it, personally. It was visually stunning and it did have a good plot and characters development and I was very pleased that they got the same actor to do Lucien. I was very impressed how they made events and timeline the same because it would have been noticeable if they hadn't (if you've seen the first two movies). I liked the actress that played Sonja and to those who complain that Selene wasn't in the movie...duh. It's a prequel, BEFORE Selene. BEFORE Michael. The only reason I gave this movie four stars instead of five is that the one sex scene in the movie was horrible cheesy and that Sonja wasn't blonde (like in Lucien's memories in the other two films). Small things, I know, but I am picky with particulars.  But all in all, I think it is a movie worth seeing. But I suggest not seeing it first. You should see the other two films before this one or else there are no surprises and the \\"first\\" Underworld movie, the one released first, would seem highly boring. This movie is made to be seen last as to supplement the other films. I enjoyed it immenesly and will be proud to add it to my collection.
0385736002|5.0|I am a Potter fan and was having geek withdrawals and needed a new adventure type series to get into and I found these on Amazon and I love them.

1591841992|5.0|Dan Roam absolutely rocked my world!  (I would draw a picture, but Amazon reviews don't allow an etch-a-sketch option yet.)    After reading this book for myself, I purchased 4 additional copies to share with friends (a couple entrepreneurs, senior executive, and a backup for me).    The heart of this book is summarized on page 141 -- the Visual Thinking Codex.  This is a master list of problem solving pictures identified by situation, depending on which framework (who/what, how much, where, when, how, & why) and S.Q.V.I.D. (simple/elaborate, quality/quantity, vision/execution, individual/competition, change/as-is).  This previous sentence doesn't make much sense right now... but it will!    Have you been in board stiff in a presentation?  are group meetings the bane of your existence?  probably!    When you talk to others are they excited?  inspired?  do they viscerally react to your initial thoughts and share onpoint brainstorms and feedback?  Unlikely.    Our education system focuses on the building blocks without consideration for the packaging.  This book does a great job of improving our communication skills so we can become much more effective working with others.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|It is a good movie mostly about a troubled teen getting back on the right track with her life. All she needed was someone to believe in her. I would recommend this film to parents with teenagers. The dancing in the film keeps it interesting and fun.
B0019CSXAM|3.0|To put it very shortly, it's pretty good, but not as good as seasons 1 and 2.  To put it lengthy, Ted starts to act a bit like Barney, but isn't anywhere near as funny about it or as good at it as Niel Patrick Harris.  On the plus side, Marshal and Lily are still as enjoyable as ever, except that Lily's hair looks kinda funny.  Robin is pretty much just typical Robin.  Regardless, get it if you enjoy the show, just be warned that this season is most definitely not its strong point.
0060557818|5.0|Style: A+<br />Plot: A<br />Character Development: A-<br />Uniqueness: A+<br />Enjoyment: A+<br />Read 6-12 months ago<br />First off, I haven't read fantasy in ages and prefer futuristic or non-fictions novels.  I have to admit that this was one of the most difficult books to put down.  The style is akin to Douglas Adams (both main characters are also reminiscent of one another), but with a darker tone.  This book changed the way that I view fantasy fiction and has reignited my interest in the genre!  I find myself obsessing over the sequel that he hinted will come sooner than later.<br /><br />If you are looking for a novel that has British humor that is dark (not depressing) mixed with a fantastical world far removed from whimsical fairies and elves, this is the book for you.  I would hazard the suggestion that this is a fantasy book for cyberpunk people.
1401216676|5.0|I loved this book, even if it was just a book of pictures, that alone would be worth buying it, the artist is greeeaaaat! I got this book because of the hype that surrounds it and was not let down. The story at first is a bit slow but boy does it gain momentum quick. And before you know it it is over, but the specials at the end are still fun to read after the comic is finished. Please add to your library!!

B001D8W7CW|5.0|Quite simply, Carrie is one of the finest masterpieces to hit the motion picture screen.  No other than Sissy Spacek could have played the downtrodden, bullied young girl with telekentic powers who is the brunt of everyone's jokes.  To make matters worse, she lives with her crazed, religious mother who complicates life for her bullied daughter.  Piper Laurie is superb in this role and should have received co-top billing, rather than John Travolta.  He was actually the weak link in the whole story, yet he received co-billing.  But that aside, Carrie gets her revenge and those who tormented her pay a terrible price!  The prom scene is one of the most gripping I've ever seen.  Acting, photography and Brian de Palmas expert directing make Carrie one great film!
6304498969|5.0|There is nothing like a live performance to test the mettle of a musician.  As a mentor of mine once said, \\"you do your best and worst in rehearsal and your average in concert.\\"  A musician of Clapton's caliber proves his ability and musicianship time and time again, in every performance he gives, and this recording is no exception.  He and his band produced a marvelous work!  The only drawback was that this seems to be an analog recording shunted over to a dvd without remastering, so the video quality leaves a little to be desired.  Of course, this does not reflect on the quality of the music.  I have owned the CD and the VHS of this for many years - it is good to have it in a newer medium.
1881273156|5.0|This book changed the way I look at relationships.  First off, I'm single and I read it anyway.  While I admit, the information in this book doesn't provide any earth-shattering concepts, I found was that it organized common sense.   By understanding your primary need, you can accept that it's valid and not just being \\"needy\\" because you like to spend time together or too \\"emotional\\" because you like to express your feelings or you are a \\"gold digger\\" because you like gifts, etc.  The idea in this book is that you have one main \\"language\\" that makes you feel the most loved.  It's completely acceptable and your partner just needs to know what it is.   In turn, you need to understand what your partner needs to feel loved and then do it!  When your partner feels loved, you reap the benefits of feeling connected and he/she will want you to feel loved too.  It's a great concept.   As far as what I got out of it by reading it while single, I was able to identify with some of my past failed relationships and understand more why they didn't work.  Whether you are single, newly married, about to be married, (about to be divorced), I recommend this book. I think it can apply it to all relationships and is a good tool for understanding the people in your life as well as yourself.
0307277453|5.0|For those of you who look at this book and are afraid it will be too complex or technical, fear not. Neil Shubin has taken the subject of evolution and made it interesting and engrossing while keeping it accessible to all ages. It is nice to see there is a scientist who can integrate the fossil record, comparitive anatomy and embryology as well as genetic information to show how human organs such as the ear, eye and limbs have developed from fish and/or amphibian predecessors. So much funding now goes to genetics, molecular biology, bioinformatics and computer modeling it is nice to know there are still scientists who crack open rocks or peer through a microscope for a living and make valuable contributions to science. The power of this story is not in the narrative, though it is humorous at times (not laugh out loud funny like Bill Bryson, nor as witty as Michael Pollan) and it is not written in the overly descriptive prose of a novel (think Cormac McCarthy describing a susnset in one of the border trilogy). This book takes a subject matter we can all relate to, our own bodies, and uses great examples and comparisons to show us how we have evolved to become the only bipedal mammals on the planet. Give this book to a friend or a child you know in Junior High School or High School who is interested in science, they will not be disappointed.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Wonderfully creative story mixing modern times with Austen's Pride and Prejudice characters.  Well acted, lots of fun to watch !   Highly recommended !!
B00004RJ74|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this in the theater quite a few years ago, and very distinctly remember the experience, particularly at the halfway point when I asked if they switched movies on us.  The movie starts out as a traditional bank robber chase, then completely mutates into a far different film.  You probably need to be a guy to enjoy (and not just because of the bikini work in the 2nd half.  I really enjoyed the sets though; very creative ti**y bar in its use of lights, construction, etc.
1423101472|5.0|Let's just admit it from the start: Percy Jackson and the Olympians is the perfect book series for both kids and adults. It's perfect for kids because it's full of things children love to read about- mystery, adventure, really bad villains, humor, and of course, a likeable hero for a main character. It's perfect for adults because, even though it meshes Greek myths together, it gets kids interested in hearing the real story, making them really learn something. Which makes their parents very happy. Plus, the parents can pretend to \\"just be reading it to my kid,\\" while enjoying it as much as their son or daughter does! As a teenage girl, I've seen this happen with my parents. And I'm sure I'm not the only one. But back on the subject--the book itself.    Firstly, there are major spoilers coming. So unless you want to know the entire plot of the book, uhh, please don't read the rest of this. Don't say I didn't warn you!     The book, naturally enough, begins with a bang- in this case, whatever sort of a bang Blackjack's hooves make when they land on Percy's stepdad's new car. Percy barely has time to wave good-bye to one of my favorite side characters, Rachel, before he's whisked off with Blackjack and Beckendorf (Hephaestus's son and one of the lodestones of Camp Half-Blood) on a mission to destroy the Princess Andromeda. Luckily, their mission is successful: the demon cruise ship is no more. Unluckily, they have to pay a price for their victory. Only around thirty pages into the book comes the first death of a well-known character. And he's not the only one to die. Poor Beckendorf--he doesn't get to see the happy ending!    Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood, where he breaks the sad news about his fellow camper's demise. Everyone, not unnaturally, is pretty upset--especially Beckendorf's girlfriend, Silena Beauregard. However, with no time to waste, Chiron and Annabeth manage to show Percy the infamous prophecy in the fourth chapter of the book. I must admit--it was alittle dissapointing to have it unveiled so soon. I'm a great fan of drama. But what a prophecy it turns out to be! And what a reaction it gets out of Percy! \\"I don't want to have my soul reaped!!\\" Priceless! However, it's not all fun and games--the prophecy hints that Percy will die shortly after he turns 16. Which is is 5 days. Not exactly an optimistic beginning...    Percy ends up in the woods, where he runs into both Mrs. O'Leary the friendly hellhound and Nico Di Angelo, another of my favorite supporting characters. Nico takes Percy on an incredibly dangerous journey involving Luke's dysfunctional family, Nico's not-much-better family, and the underworld itself. To make about 50 pages short, Percy goes through the same thing that Achilles went through and that Luke went through in order to be able to host Kronos. He's virtually invincible except for one spot on his body-- his own personal Achilles' heel, if you will.    Soon enough, though, Percy finds himself back in New York City, defending his home turf from an enormous monster attack with only about 40 half-bloods. Although reinforcements keep arriving, many deaths of beloved characters occur, with only brief pauses in the action to mourn them. The knowledge of a spy among the campers keeps the suspicion surging forward until a shocking truth is revealed, and a side plot involving Luke's mom, the Oracle mummy, Hades, and Rachel will keep readers guessing what Rachel's true place is. But although the giant, flying pigs and huge drakons are exciting, possibly the most gripping scene in the entire book takes place with just Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Kronos. On Mount Olympus. In the gods' throne room, to be precise.    Just as it was predicted many years ago, Percy makes the choice that will save Olympus--with an extremely unexpected twist added. Yes, the prophecy comes true...but the hero who dies is not Percy. And the reason why he doesn't die is thanks to none other than the almost-forgotten Annabeth. Idon't want to give this part away, because it's possibly the most important and touching scene in the entire series. But I have to say--it almost made me cry.    Yes, Percy Jackson saved Olympus. And yes, the ending was perfect. Everything was neatly sewn up; everyone was happy; everything turned out great. But. There's a new prophecy on the loose. And I have more than just a feeling that another Camp Half-Blood series is in the works. Most of the time, I hate it when an author just keeps writing books for money. But since I believe that this series has only gotten better with time? Well, bring it on, Rick Riordan!!
B001B7CNXI|3.0|I think Michael Mann is one of the best directors out today.  Consider Heat, Last of the Mohicans, Collateral, etc.  Great stuff.  And I particularly enjoy his style; I'm not sure if I'm right, but he seems to shoot a lot with handheld cameras and natural light (as opposed to well lit scenes w/ artificial lights).  It makes for a very distinctive feel that I enjoy.  This movie is in that vein, but with some challenges.  The overall story is pretty decent, and certainly consistent with the brazenly neon miami vice of yesterday.  The problem is the dialog and lines.  A lot of it is incredibly artificial and downright awful.  I actually laughed quite a few times in the theater while listening to colin farrell's lines.  I surprised myself and bought the dvd, only to realize that i really enjoy a select few scenes.  The opening boat race scene is good, but i especially enjoy the scene where they cigarette boat-it to cuba.  very good music, the engine revving sounds great in surround sound, etc.  So this is one most appreciated by enjoying scenes in isolation, and, IMHO, that's OK.
076790382X|2.0|Someone in my book club selected this book for the group to read.  It is a compilation of articles written for a weekly newspaper.  While I'm sure the articles worked as a weekly supplement, the compilation is... boring.  While certainly a talented writer, article after article seemed the same style - flat - and eventually boring.  Perhaps more selectivity should have been exercised in picking those articles to be used, rather than just slapping them together into a book.  Also - the author's wife is correct - he complains alot!
0385333846|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five was written in 1969, in the middle of the Vietnam War.  However, his story is not directly about Vietnam, but about his own war experience during World War II.  Although it is an anti-war book its purpose is not to stop war, but to expose it and its terrible effects.  His style both aids and hinders in creating the effects of frustration and understanding he wants from his readers.    Vonnegut always wanted to write a book about his experience of the Dresden bombings.  He was finally able to write this story during the Vietnam War.  Vonnegut was always frustrated with the fact that people named World War II the \\"Good War\\" and he makes this point in his sardonic account of the war.  His purpose is not to try and stop the war in Vietnam; he simply wants people to understand that no war is good.  As Tim O'Brien says, \\"war is just another name for death\\". Obvious right? Not always.  Some people's perceptions of war are that it is a glamorous experience full of brave, strong, and morally driven soldiers.    Vonnegut stabs all common war misconceptions through the heart as he reveals the ridiculous nature of war.  He introduces his main character Billy Pilgrim as a ribald.  Before the war he studies to be an optometrist and is then shipped off to war and proves useless.  He is opiated by his war experiences and is ready to die, but his fellow soldier, Roland Weary, will not give up on this pathetic excuse for a soldier.  They are then captured by Germans and ironically Weary dies, but Pilgrim lives.  When Billy returns home after the war he says that he is abducted by Tralfamdorians (a group of aliens) and he begins to be able to travel fluidly throughout time.  The book is comprised of flashes forward and backward in time in no apparent pattern.  Billy is obviously experiencing the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which was and is a huge problem for anyone who experiences the atrocities of war.  This ridiculous person that Billy becomes shows the terrible effects war can have.  Other such examples of the ludicrous nature of war are seen throughout the book and with the characterization of the soldiers.  Vonnegut depicts the Germans as the most sophisticated and \\"good\\" group out of all the other soldiers from different nations.  The Allies are either depicted as weak and diffident(Americans) or pompous(British).  Ironically, the one American soldier who is consistently seen as a good and strong man is shot by a firing squad in Dresden for taking an abandoned teapot in the middle of all the destruction.  You can almost hear Vonnegut saying something along the lines of, \\"That's war for you!\\"  This shockingly blasé style is one of the ways that Vonnegut makes his readers understand the preposterous tendencies of war.  Vonnegut constantly repeats certain key phrases throughout the book.  The most striking one is, \\"so it goes\\".  This is a phrase and idea that Billy Pilgrim learned from the Trafalmadorians.  Whenever someone dies this phrase is repeated, which turns out to be quite a lot in a war story.  By the end of the book the reader just wants to yell \\"No! People dying matters! It is not a \\"so it goes\\" kind of thing\\".  Vonnegut's purposeful use of litotes in order to get the reader angry is very effective, while some of his other strategies are not.  The constant time travel that Billy Pilgrim experiences throughout the book is very distracting.  Although it is supposed to exemplify the confusion and PTSD of the soldiers, it often makes the reader feel nonplussed.  Vonnegut is also very anticlimactic.  This whole story is leading up to the bombing of Dresden and it really only takes up a very short portion of the book, like a side note to the real story.  His purpose here is to again make the reader understand that nothing can really be said about tragedy.  However he tends to lose his message along the way.
031606792X|5.0|Great book! Loved the Edward and Bella parts! Not as much action as the other three books, but it is still a great read!
B0015ABRE2|3.0|Dexter is one of the best shows on TV, and one of the few I would admit to watching on a regular basic, frankly.  For me, it's all about Michael C. Hall.  Or mostly about him.  The side players have strengthened from season 1 to season 2, as did all elements of the show.  But going to season 3, it's hard to wonder if the creative team wasn't a bit burnt out and dry for ideas.  Don't misunderstand.  It's still a good show and certainly worth your time if you are a Dexter fan.  However, I felt like the writers and actors struggled to give the characters things to do to justify their presence this year as well as falling a little flat for me giving Dexter a moral dilemma about friendship and connection that I felt like was already covered excellently in season 2.  That being said, Jimmy Smits does a good job, providing some of the seasons most memorable scenes, such as his incognito disguise in one of the later episodes and his \\"COUNT ON IT!\\" outburst on a Miami rooftop.  Another complaint.  The showrunners like to talk about Dexter as being a character who the audience likes but who eventually repels the audience when his Dark Passenger reveals itself.  I disagree.  I don't get this sense at all.  Dexter the killer feels more and more like Dexter the superhero to me, defending truth and justice and the American way, haha.  Yeah, something isn't right here.  For a character who likes to believe he has no conscience, why does the show increasingly motivate his character by giving him one?  Of all the far fetched plots on the show, I think the rehabilitation of a serial killer as we're watching as the series goes on (his lesser evil murders to protect his family and sister, etc) is perhaps the least believable.           I hope season 4 delves into deeper moral conflict.  Like what if the Dark Passenger begins feeling compelled to go after Dexter's own family?  In other words, I'm hoping the show goes back to mining its dark premise for what it's worth.  What a rare opportunity to do so.

B0012GMXA6|5.0|On this of her many albums, Gloria Estefan truly excels.  She had long since proven herself the master of creative, exciting and extremely catchy numbers, as well as more than a few great and memorable love songs, but this collection shows without question that she has amazing cultural and familial depth as well. A fascinating, \\"pegajoso\\" and beautiful line-up of upbeat material--no fan of the Miami Sound Machine should be unaware of this side of its moving force.  My wife and I have listened to the album countless times now, and we have yet to tire of it.  Viva la Gloria!

0061544493|5.0|[[ASIN:0061544493 That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between]]  This book is beautiful and she must have put a lot of care into it. It is posh by all means. The color, weight, design, and feel are quite rich. I never knew much about Victoria Beckham other than she was in a successful UK girl band and married to David Beckham, the soccer player. After reading this I could see why he is so in love with her. She is so candid and shares helpful tips and is a total girly-girl. I was always a tomboy with sex appeal, but Victoria helped me to step up my feminine beauty and go the extra half an inch. With a few simple steps of hers I went out feeling and looking so much more sexier, yet still comfortable. Nowadays, women need a galfriend like Victoria to help them shop and style and find their own sense of fashion in a more upgraded appeal because, face it, we have become LAZY. Victoria shows us how to not give up the comfort, and still look hot! She is a mother of two, a wife of an icon and an artist and business woman. She is extremely practical in her approach and doesn't have time to be stuffy, phony or just a trophy. Victoria has earned my total respect and awe as a woman. This book is for you if you're into the posh fashion scene and it is also for you if you are not. It is also for you if you are a man (to get a clue & they love the photos). She also gives extensive shopping resources that fit every budget and economical station. \\"That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between\\" by Victoria Beckham is worth every penny.

031606792X|4.0|I teach English literature, so I read a lot.  This book could have been broken into two, I believe.  The first part of the book is well-written and interesting - we all want to know if Bella and Edward consummate their relationship.  The last part of the book is well-written, too . . .I think that it was ended decently.  Seriously, how can an author please everyone with the perfect ending?  Not everyone is going to be happy about it.  The middle part is where I got lost, in a sense.  The author seems to be rushing through, trying to get the story to the point where the Volturi challenge the Cullens and Quileutes.    I would have suggested to the author that a whole other book be largely devoted to Bella and Edward,their new relationship, the birth of Reneesmee, and Bella's becoming a part of the Cullen family.  As a reader, we get just a glossing over of their complete infatuation and true love for each other.  Even after she is changed, the story is glossed.  An entire other book could have been about the Volturi, the idea of the immortal child and the battle.  I think that would have satisfied me as a reader much more.  The whole idea of Bella and Edward is that of star-crossed lovers, and then the star-crossed lovers actually get married, survive great change in their relationship and themselves, and get to have a child.  This is hardly even discussed in Breaking Dawn.

I couldn't decide whether the real star here was Tokyo itself or the movie's magnificently sketched characters.

Hats off to everyone involved in making this delightful film!
B000IJ79WU|3.0|You might like this version of the classic Superman film, but I didn't.  I liked the original.  I can't explain why, really, other than to say that certain scenes did not appear dramatic at all even though you knew they should be.  Since Superman is such a favorite of mine from many years ago, I got so used to the way I first saw it.  This jarred me a bit.    Then again, when I saw Amadeus the first time, it was the director's cut with extra scenes.  I loved it!!  I went out to buy more of Mozart's music right away... yet what would happen if I saw the original version?  Would I like that as much as the longer version?    Either way, these are great movies depending on which versions you like best.    And yes, I do recommend Amadeus very highly!!

0425221806|4.0|The title of this short review says it all really. I just finished reading Watchers last night and, though it is the first Dean R. Koontz novel I've ever read, it has definitely put me on track to read more of his work.    The writing style is smooth, flows very naturally, and has all the pace and intrigue you'd expect from a bestseller. The characters are likable and detestable exactly when and how they're supposed to be, and I guarantee that, if you've any humanity in you, you'll care a hell of a lot about Einstein before you're even halfway through the book.    Some elements seem a little convenient (like Travis having served in Delta Force - how many elite special forces guys have you met? Probably not even one, right?), but, if you can look past these occasional bits and pieces, you'll find a tale that will keep you awake and reading long after the bedside lamp should have been switched off.    Enjoy!

1423101472|5.0|I had it on reserve at the bookstore. And then I got the e-mail that it was there, waiting for me to come and get it and read it. I rushed over and grabbed my copy of THE LAST OLYMPIAN, the final book in the PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS series, and that night I went home and devoured the thing. I went into it thinking, \\"Okay, I know this is the last one, and Rick Riordan has been amazing with his plot twists and characters, how can this one really live up to everything and just blast it all out of the water? Maybe he'll have lost his touch after five books.\\" And then, as I was reading, I was not disappointed. Riordan delivered. And he delivered good. THE LAST OLYMPIAN was a blasting ride into one of the most inventive uses of Greek mythology ever.<br /><br />The story picks up right where THE BATTLE FOR THE LABYRINTH stopped, and I must say, you've got to read the first four books before you come to this. I would even say you need to read the short story about Percy Jackson and Hades in THE DEMIGOD FILES to really get the full picture of everything. All that said, this, the fifth book jumps right in and gets going. The world is at the edge of its civilization. Kronos has mobilized his plans and his forces, and now everything is going to come down to a battle to the finish to see whether the Great Prophecy about Percy Jackson is fulfilled: Will he save Mount Olympus? Or will he end up helping it be destroyed? Either way, Percy Jackson is dead.<br /><br />This had to be the most action-packed book in the series. The whole thing was an amazingly huge battle with all different kinds of monsters, demigods, titans, and gods fighting it out over Olympus. Riordan is at his top form here -- he always excels at action scenes, and things run along so smoothly here, it's hard to keep up sometimes. I kept flipping pages so fast I didn't even check the page count (as I usually do). The plot twists kept coming, and I kept finding myself gasping out loud at each new turn. And, my ultimate test for any book: I got goosebumps twice during THE LAST OLYMPIAN.<br /><br />And Riordan doesn't leave off on characterization. Percy Jackson still has ways to grow -- and the themes that Riordan pulls out are amazing. All of his characters grow in different ways this book, and you finally find out the mysteries surrounding so many of them: Luke, Percy, Annabeth, Thalia, Nico, and even Rachel Elizabeth Dare.<br /><br />The one thing I am glad to say is that even though these books have ended, at the very end of the book, in the Acknowledgments, Riordan says, \\"As the first Camp Half-Blood series draws to a close...\\" which makes me believe that there will be more to come from Riordan based on this world he's created and revamped.<br /><br />All in all, there couldn't be a better series of books to spend time on. (It rivals Harry for sure... I might even like Percy Jackson better...) Don't miss out. Read these books. You won't be sorry. And if you are... well... there are special places in the Underworld for you.for any book: I got goosebumps twice during THE LAST OLYMPIAN.    And Riordan doesn't leave off on characterization.

B001WCN23W|5.0|Sticky Fingers is a no-brainer if you like your hard rock served with dabs of blues, r&b, soul, country, and jazz. Great songwriting. Superb playing. Non-PC cover and lyrics. If you don't have it, go for it, you won't be disappointed. For what it's worth, I've read quite a few reviews on fan sites regarding the sound quality of these 2009 Universal remasters and the general consensus is that they are louder but not necessarily better - It's Only Rock 'n' Roll being the most improved. I'll stick to my 1994 Virgin remasters for now - those sound good enough to my ears - maybe come next remaster the Stones will get with it and throw in some rarities as bonus tracks to sweeten the deal.

B001PA0FFO|3.0|Doubt is probably a good play rendered banal by the movie screen. There's just not enough of the play, which is a series of dialogues, to fit a feature film. Nonetheless, the substance of the work packs something of a wallop, emphasizing how moral certainty does very little to serve a relentlessly relativistic universe.     You will probably not be bowled over by Doubt because of its vehicle, but the theme has resonance and the content will not leave you until you have sorted it out. I guess this could be seen as anti-religious in a way, but I think that the characters are just useful platforms for a truth that transcends faith and churchgoing and whatnot.     Judge ye not. A hard lesson to learn, but hey, that's the stuff of theatre. See it, and be patient with the movie itself because it's not all that great.

I was sooo excited about knowing what the future held for Edward and Bella, but now I wish I would have never found out. It's almost as if the author forgot where she wanted to go with the rest of the series. This book was much too over the top. I felt like this book got mixed up in some excerpts from an x-men comic or something. Reading minds, and seeing the future, I can deal with, but rubber invisible shields, manipulating the elements, electric shock, that is way over the top. Even after all those super powers, there was still not a fight to the finish involved. What the fu... dge??? I don't even want to know what happens to Reneseme and Jacob when they decide to have children, their gonna have to get Marvel Comics to battle against such a child considering all of the possibilities of power they could acquire from each side of the family...

B001KOFH2G|5.0|As a person who initially committed to the HD DVD format, partly in order to view this wonderful movie in a high-definition print, I must say this is not the review I expected to be writing. Bottom line: the HD DVD was beautiful; the Blu-ray is even better.<br /><br />For context, I'm evaluating these on a 50\\" Pioneer Elite Kuro TV through very good electronics, but without the newer HDMI 1.3 ability to pass a lossless, true DTS HD sound signal by means of that connection.  So when I say that the sound on the Blu-ray is much more dynamic than on the HD DVD, I am comparing apples-to-apples the converted digital signal as processed by my 3-year old Pioneer Elite AVR.  Not only does the Blu-ray deliver a far greater dynamic range, but the center channel dialogue is much clearer than I have ever heard it, including in any theater.  The directionality and clarity of the surround effects are simply awesome, putting this disc in the demonstration-quality range for the sound alone.<br /><br />But it doesn't stop there. The picture is also the most vibrant I have seen it: vivid color saturation, and accurate reproduction of the visuals I remember from the theater, not to mention it being the first time I have ever experienced the computer-generated special effects scenes as looking truely high-def themselves.  All in all, a recommended purchase for Serenity fans; lovers of that type of sci-fi film that, like the original Day the Earth Stood Still, assays a rarified level of artistry and social commentary; and (yeah, I admit it) an incredible Blu-ray experience.  The differences are worth it.

Having run the majority of their set over the past week I believe Songs of Faith and Devotion is their best, or at least my favorite.  Perhaps the strife within the band led to this brooding, dynamic set of tunes. The atmosphere of this album is incredible.  It's an amazing listen, especially the remastered edition.  It's been 16 years since it was first released and has stood the test of time. Play it on a good hi-fi system in the evening while enjoying a red wine- heaven on earth.

B001VLXNLU|3.0|Marked is the first in the series of books called 'House Of Night' which is a vampire finishing school. In my opinion, an absolutely fabulous concept, no sarcasm there. Where it goes all wrong is with the lead character.      Meet Zoey Redbird. Your 'average' American teenager. Except she's anything but. She is Marked by a Tracker, which makes her a vampire fledgling, and means she must get to the House Of Night as soon as possible. Except she doesn't. She runs home, hoping her mother will comfort her. In the pages before this moment, its clear that Zoey's mother has forsaken her daughter for her controlling new husband. I have to say, that as someone who's had to deal with awful step parents herself, Zoey's emotions...they were stereotypical, and not well written.       After discovering that her parents won't help or accept her now because she's been Marked, Zoey turns to her Grandma, but before she can explain what's happened, she falls unconscious and her spirit or subconscious is whisked away where she meets the Goddess Nyx. Nyx is revered by all vampires, and Nyx blesses Zoey, telling her she is special and gifted. When Zoey wakes, she finds herself at the House Of Night, under the care of a powerful High Priestess of Nyx.       Zoey is indeed special, but just to special, especially for someone who's going out of her way to be so ordinary. The dynamics between Zoey and the other teenage vampires was, in my opinion, poorly written. Someone completely new, and quite honestly a threat to the status of the other kids at the school, is not just immediately accepted by four other people. I'm sorry. It just does not happen. Nor would an upper class man who could have any one in the school he wanted be immediately attracted to Zoey.       The villain of the book is not much of a villain. Just a bully. Perhaps she will grow into something else, but, for now, she's just a bully who Zoey manages to take down in about 48 hours. I'm sorry, but the bully was in place for years before Zoey arrived at the House Of Night. That kind of power is not shifted in just a short 48 hours, I don't care what kind of sequence of events occurs to bring it about.     All in all, a very interesting spin on an old concept. I like the characters all except for Zoey and the villain. The verbal interaction between them is nicely written, but, the development of character, particularly Zoey's is...its enough to make any seasoned writer twitch. Those of you who cannot read a book simply for concept, and need to have good characters, don't read this, or you will be disgusted. Those of you who enjoy a story purely for its story, and not its characters, will love this book. In my opinion, its good enough to be checked out of the library, but not good enough to buy.

My family knows that if I am really in a book, nothing can pull me away from it.    And so, as I desperately waited for my classes to get out, having bought The Last Olympian early that moment the doors opened at a local borders. I couldnt wait to start reading, having finished rereading book four during my lunch hour.    And I was not disappointed. Riordan has a wonderful sense of humor with a snarky edge to it. Though I usually do not enjoy books written in first person, because most authors dont get just how dangerous writing first person can be, Rick has shown a nack for choosing his words carefully, showing up a world in vivid detail, and emotional clarity. The Last Olympian is a wonderful ending to a series that had much promise, and never broke it.    To those who might be afraid I will spoil anything, I wont. I will only say this; Many twists and turns await you. In the final book of the Percy Jackson series, Rick Riordan has woven a tale, pulling all the threads together into a tapestry, with everything he had done before coming together in a epic, emotional ending... a ending that stirred my emotions in a way only one other writer, and concluding book had done, and that was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by J. K. Rowling.    While their story telling and writing styles are vastly different, what they share is a thirst for a good story, red herrings to throw you off, and a ending that you couldnt fully see coming, but cant help but be moved by in the end.    I am saddened that this story has drawn to a end, but all good stories must reach their conclusions, otherwise they stop being good.    But we can hope for Rick Riordan, for I have no doubt his gift from weaving a good story has not come to a close. I will continue to look forward to his future books.
1400082773|5.0|Would you want to read the biography of my life up to my late twenties?  Didn't think so.  What if you knew I was going to be elected Senator?  What if you knew I was going to become President?<br /><br />\\"Dreams of my Father\\" is a fascinating book.  I didn't read it ten years ago, when his claim to fame was that he was the first African-American to become President of Harvard's Law Review.  I didn't read it when he was elected by the largest margin in Illinois history to the United States Senate, only the third African-American to be elected Senator.  No - I read it recently, after the author had spent 100 days as the Leader of the Free World.<br /><br />Although the book was written prior to his national political activities, today I can't help but read the book with the perspective of what the man was to become.<br /><br />The book is a fascinating history of a multi-cultural man.  We learn that his white mother was fascinating by the beautiful dark Brazilians she saw in the film \\"Black Orpheus\\", and that many, including his mother, were impressed by the charismatic Kenyan, Barack Obama.<br /><br />We learn about his mother's caring second husband and their move to the Philippines. We also hear how his mother wants a better chance for young Barry, so she sends him to live with her parents, now living in Hawaii.<br /><br />The book has a crystalline clarity addressing issues such as the future President's mixed feelings growing up with one foot in the culture of his white grandparents while also being drawn to his African roots.<br /><br />We learn about his time in college - at Occidental in Los Angeles, prior to transferring to Columbia in New York.  After graduation he is hired in Chicago as a community organizer, where he learns about the particular pride that the black community took in Mayor Harold Washington, elected after two generations of Daleys.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a fascinating look into the life and insights of the man who would ascend to the highest office in the world.

020161622X|5.0|This is a great book full of good ideas and advice. Too much to take in all in one go, it's a book to keep on your shelf as you dip into time and again. For me, I loved the discussion on code orthogonality. I can imagine each programmer in an n-dimensional programming space proceeding along their own axis. The authors note that code orthogonality can lead to productivity gains. Code orthogonality equals programming power. You can almost think of it as similar to the AC power-factor. Power is all real power when the code is orthogonal; power is a combination of real power and apparent power when the code is not orthogonal. Apparent power is taking the same effort to produce but does no useful work. Anyway, I could go on, but orthogonality is just one section of one chapter and there is so many more ideas I like in this book. Highly recommended.
B000IJ79V6|4.0|Being perfectly honest, I didn't much care for the 1st \\"Superman.\\" It was alright, but nothing I would watch over and over. Well, this 2nd chapter raised the stakes and the improvements were most certainly there.<br /><br />At the start, Superman has to rescue Lois from terrorists in France. As he throws the terrorist's bomb into space, it explodes freeing 3 prisoners from the planet Krypton. (We of course met them briefly in Part 1. Superman's father Marlon Brando sentenced them to imprisonment.) So, we can suspect they will want revenge if they run into Superman. Of course, if they find their way to planet earth, they will have the same powers as Superman. Great suspense.<br /><br />Back on earth, Clark Kent/Superman is having his own struggles with Lois Lane. The double life is starting to wear him down. (Lois loves Superman, but only likes Clark Kent as a friend.) He is then faced with the reality that if he wants to live a normal life with Lois Lane, he can no longer function as Superman.<br /><br />Lex Luthor (captured in part 1) escapes from prison, and wonders if he can make some negotiations with the 3 villains from Krypton. (Well, we can't deny that Luthor has guts in this 2nd chapter.)<br /><br />After certain personal struggles, Clark Kent/Superman realizes his true calling. He may of wanted a normal life with Lois, but realizes he can't let these villains (with his powers) take over the world. There is a climactic showdown, and we can see that even Superman is going to have trouble fighting 3 opponents with his powers.<br /><br />Even if you didn't care much for Part 1, you should really give this 2nd chapter a chance.
B000001EAQ|3.0|3 1/2    Pop was considered poop by many fans disarmed by pseudo-vapid uncomfortable dancey experimentations- call it the Zooropa syndrome... though I would advise them to reconsider; it remains in my ears U2's last album I could also graciously acknowledge with me-too.
6305882592|5.0|\\"Harold and Maude\\" is one of the BEST films ever made. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon give such brillant and believable performances. As you watch the film you entirely forget the age difference and find yourself believing that yes, \\"Harold loves Maude\\". The music of Cat Stevens adds an undercurrent that not only is this Romeo and Juliet of the early 1970's but also an extension of the counterculture movement of the 1960's. Maude, though old enough to be Harold's Grandmother, is a free spirit that decries the materialism and rigid social conventions of the day and personifies the counterculture movement. I only wish that a sequel could have been made; something like \\"Life After Maude\\" where we would find Harold making a profound and beneficial change in American culture.
B000000OSE|3.0|Strangely in many ways these dated quicker than what made GnR in the 80's. While epic balladry clearly is the strong point, it falls few and far between raucous rockers that seldom highlight what eroded Slash-n-Axl synergy was left.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|If I could love a killer, it would have to be Dexter. He's the bad boys', bad boy. I have never seen a show quite like this.

You just can't hate Dexter; he's weird, strange and killer beware.
B00004TA41|3.0|3 1/2    Though essentially variations on a theme...what a warped theme it is, and with duo attacks this intense yet subtly effective, even conservatives would do well to take notes.

B001U0HBPG|2.0|Just throwing stars at what's a great story is counter-productive here.  It's not surprising or unexpected.  It's a short story that is stretched unimaginably into an unengrossoing overlength movie.  They could have easily dispatched with a whole segment where Cate Blanchett simply fails to look both ways before crossing an intersection.  The story THE CONFESSIONS OF MAX TIVOLI is more flushed out than BENJAMIN BUTTON and might have more meat for a movie.  But all the same, this movie didn't need the Hollywood effect that was applied overthickly.
B000024D4R|4.0|Animals is another powerful, cohesive work during their best stretch in the mid-late 70's, sometimes overlooked in favor of surrounding material. It does lack some of the profound production power inherent in Floyd's more unforgettable sonic landscapes, but was always trying to be a different beast altogether, coming across in may ways as the most down to earth (in a good way) output they've offered.. Consider it the first one to grab after you've polished off the obligatory must-owns.

0743297334|3.0|That was my second novel of Hemingway.<br />It is very easy read and there is no question about his unique way of writing in short dialogue style that was considered at that time as a new great prose.<br /><br />The story itself ,I think,is boring and has no goal.It depicts the meaningless lives of different characters,especially Jake Barnes, middle aged man,impotent and alcoholic,who is in love with Brett Ashley,seductive and pretty woman.<br /><br />Everybody in the book is lost ,is seeking peace in alcohol and sex to the point of somebody is drinking and trying to have a \\"swell time\\" in every page of the book. Alcohol seemed like an escape from a rotten hopeless life and a cure of great depression for all characters.<br /><br />Jake ,through his hidden sexual inferiority complex,sounds like a real nice man who tries his best in making Brett happy. He even arranges for her  date with the bull fighter,Pedro Romero,who is half her age.<br /><br />There is nothing in the story that you could describe as suspense,unexpected,exciting,optimistic or even natural. Everything is focused on bitter depressed melancholy that doesn't make you sympathize with anyone,including the civil and courteous Robert Cohn who sounds from another planet.<br /><br />This might be a book telling the real life of a lost generation,the aimless confusing state of punch of Americans who ran to Europe for better homeland and security after world war I.<br /><br />This short novel has many similarities to Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" or \\"Babbitt\\" of Sinclair Lewis but of lower literal value.

B001UREJWM|5.0|This work, no matter what name it's under, is a fine bit of metal.  I contacted the sight and told them I'm surprised they didn't write a track with the title The Devil You Know, as it would have fit right in.  The guitar work is great, the bass is heavy, the drums steady, and Dio, well, what can you say, he's a metal poet.  Despite what others might say, it's a nice work.  Five \\"horn\\" salutes. Oh, and one more thing, whoever trashed \\"Sweet Leaf\\" from the Ozzy era, doesn't know what he's talking about.

1401203078|1.0|This book should have been marked better.  My 11 year old loved the movie and the 1st 2 books.  However this one showed up and it was porno.  OK for an adult, but rather crude and quite graphic for anyone who is under 18!  Quite graphic sex on every page.  Don't get me wrong, as the artistic side portrays the female form and oral sex quite well, but for my kid???  Now I am stuck with this and can't give it to my kid, as I did the first 2 books, but who do I sell it to???????  I learned a lesson here I guess.
B001UE27X8|5.0|Not simply a rehash of \\"The Best of.....\\" this album plays two alternate cuts of the same song at the same recording session.  While the differences are at times subtle, it's terrific to hear them side by side.

B001PK3M1S|5.0|The international version of the album includes 3 new extra songs, which are very nice. Course they may not be hit single material, as it usually is with bonuses, but they are good quality. It is worth the extra money, especially as lonely planet managed to import an inexpensive version - what I got was a Malaysian printing - top quality both booklet and CD, booklet in English not Malay. The version of \\"Love Story\\" is exacly the same as on the American edition - some rumors have surfaced that the international one is different, but they aren't true.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie is for people who like to know the cold, hard truth. This movie captures the innocence of two eight year old boys: German and Jew. During the holocaust. How wrong the whole thing was. How people were suffering, adult and child alike. But the great thing is is that the little boys friendship doesnt suffer. It stays strong even though it is forbibben. To these little boys it didn't matter what they believed in, they would always be friends.     A great movie. I cried everytime I watched it, no matter how many times. You will not be disapointed. I promise!
1577311523|4.0|I have read many books based on the theory of 'now'.  This one by Mr. Tolle is decent, but in my opinion, not the best book on the subject.  He lays more of an outline and tells more of a personal story which some people might actually find helpful.  To me, the concept of 'now' is a more personal journey that you need to find for yourself.  Following an outline will not get you there alone.  Overall this book says plenty of things that have all been said before, just in a different way.  It is worth a read.
0099429799|4.0|I often walk away from an Ian McEwan novel shaken by the fear that a seemingly innocuous moment can become a catalyst for tragic consequences.      In `Atonement', 13-year-old Briony Tallis bears false testimony in a state of misguided self-righteousness, which sends an innocent man into prison, and estranges her from her sister, Cecilia, whom she had thought she was protecting in the first place.    What is chilling in the narrative is McEwan's convincing portrayal of how a precocious child witnesses more than she understands, comes to a brash conclusion, and armed with what she passionately believes to be legitimate motives, chooses to propagate her interpretation of events.     A significant portion of the novel traces the central characters separately in the midst of war-strewn England and France during WWII. However, Briony learns that the collective pain and suffering meted by the carnage of war can never displace her more personal act of betrayal.  Neither time nor distance, not even her attempts to rewrite what has happened, are able to let her gain atonement to her very last days.
B00009V7P8|5.0|i bought this cd years ago, when i was living abroad. i was in a pub in scotland the first time i heard one of the songs (amie) and finally bought the album right before i was due to come back to the states. though a little depressing at times, the album is wonderful. i might be slightly biased, as the cd reminds me of an amazing time in my life, but i still listen to it, at the very least, once a week. there is so much emotion in every bit of every song. i love how the music takes me to another place, and makes me feel some sort of connection to others and to the human condition. just a side note...i was a little dissapointed in his sophomore album \\"9\\". i knew immediately that something was different. turned out to be the producer. some guy in LA. broke my heart! oh well, i guess i'll always have \\"O\\".
B000007ODY|5.0|Jeez!  I'm listening to it even as I type! Herbert Von Karajan seems to understand Brahms well enough to make this two CD set well worth the listen!  Brahms is great and his Symphonies are suberb.  I'm not quite sure which one I like best.  The Second is the most famous, but I'm a broody Scorpio so I lean toward number Three.  But the number Four keeps surprising me in delightful ways as well.  And of course, the First was good enough to egg him on to compose more, so there you have it in a nutshell.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Lady GaGa has surprisingly put a fresh spin into current pop music. You can obviously see her pulling inspiration from the likes of David Bowie and Madonna. She has an amazing way of putting a new twist on things that have already been done in the music world. The album is a very theatrical piece of work. Many of the songs have a dark 80s synthesizer feel to them, but the lyrics are able to take us to much happier places. Lady GaGa also manages to add humor to the music in the way that she delivers each song. \\"Just Dance\\" was the perfect lead single to pull from this collection. It proved itself by reaching #1 on the Billboard Charts. It's a non-stop dance single that is sure to get any party going. \\"LoveGame\\" and \\"Poker Face\\" showcase GaGa satisfying her sexual appetite with tongue-n-cheek lyrics and thick beats. She also offers up a softer side with \\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) and the somber \\"Brown Eyes.\\" The Fame is able to come across as a very enjoyable dance record. I do feel that the album should be shortened by two songs. It does tend to feel a tad bit lengthy with 14 tracks on the disc. It's all just a matter of opinion.     The Fame is probably one of the greatest pop/dance records within the last 10 years. It allows the audience to take a glimpse into Lady GaGa's world of fashion, art, money, sex, and fame. She oozes sex appeal, has a great voice, and even writes her own material. Pick this one up.

B001PL4HZW|4.0|I already had the Twilight Soundtrack and wondered if it would be worth the money to purchase this edition.  I really have enjoyed the remixes of the MuteMath and Black Ghost songs. The DVD items are interesting, especially for Twilight fans.I really like the Paramore clips.  Overall, I would say that Yes it was worth buying a second copy of the soundtrack.  What would have made it better? If they had added \\"Let Me Sign\\" by Rob Pattinson.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|J.J. Abrams has done the impossible by making a Star Trek film for everyone. It will appeal to long time fans (most anyways) and the unintiated alike. What really surprised me is how this is more of a character driven film than one relying just on action and SFX. The casting is outstanding, especially Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. Pine manages to get the essence of Kirk, but not being a parody of William Shatner. He is cocky, yet you know there is intelligence that goes along with his recklessness. Before watching this movie I couldn't think of anyone who combines the looks and smarts to play Spock other than Leonard Nimoy, but Quinto manages to pull it off brilliantly. Karl Urban made a very good Dr. McCoy early on, but they seemed to forget about his character as the movie progressed. The rest of the cast is good, but they are not given that much to do. I just heard on the news that most have signed on for two more movies, so perhaps they will all get their due in future installments. Eric Bana was the weak link here for me. He just wasn't a very intimidating villain. Maybe it was more of the character than his actual acting, but he is not even close to the legend that is Khan. Leonard Nimoy's role was pivotal and not just some cheap cameo, so that was nice.<br /><br />The story, while not mind blowing, is clever enough. For a time travel plot, it is rather easy to follow and I like how they made it an alternate reality to cover up any inconsistencies with the past series.<br /><br />The music (loved how they used the old theme music over the end credits) and SFX are very good as expected. There is also quite a bit of humor that works most of the time. My theater was pretty much full and everyone seemed to be having a good time during and after the movie ended. Star Trek is a well made summer blockbuster that has wide appeal and will likely spawn at least two sequels. So beam up to your local theater and prepare to boldy go where no man has gone before.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 starsnd 1/2 out of 5 stars
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|ABC would be loosing a winning move to cancel the season old Castle. The show is appealing to mystery, romance, and action seekers, all in one. The characters are witty, and the chemistry between Nathan Fillion & Stana Katic is electric in it's under toned innocents. It is a smart, fast, and (reasonably) family friendly show. Castle could easily corner the nitch market of second generation Murder She Wrote and Matlock lovers with it's new kid banter and revved up forensics. Careful not to be overly gory like some of the show's contemporary crime busters Castle is one that is clean enough for even viewers with the highest of TV scruples to bend to as a guilty pleasure. Keep your Castle ABC it may be the best move you make among conservative viewers who still want to find something worth playing with on TV.
0385333846|5.0|At first it is difficult to imagine that a story about a phlegmatic man who experiences a horrific firestorm attack in Dresden, while a POW, and communes with aliens can have any literary significance.  Its value is even more questionable by the seemingly haphazard lack of sequencing of the protagonist's, Billy Pilgrim, experiences and encounters.  Part way through the story, there is a sense that Billy and the aliens colluded to confuse the reader, and that the author's errant mind wandered to the point of grouping a series of chaotic, non-sequential  events for the purpose of filling up the pages.  However, the vigilant reader will observe and glean that the author has an intended message delivered by a circuitous route.  Therefore, this book merits a five star rating for literary importance.  Through the somewhat quixotic life of Billy Pilgrim, the author addresses the fundamental notion of survival - whether it is physical or mental continued existence.  Billy Pilgrim from the beginning is thrown into a world in which he senses and is aware of people's disapprobation of him.  He is painted as a weakling, who is ill-fitting, unprepared, naïve and hardly an errant hero.  However, Billy Pilgrim has unwittingly learned a profound and valuable ability; he has mastered a coping mechanism that is essential to his survival.  There is a certain degree of irony in the story, because Billy Pilgrim's life is convoluted and bizarre, yet this outrageous crazy-like behavior gives him a sense of sanity.  One can't help but to laugh aloud when reading about Billy Pilgrim's encounter with the aliens, his sexual mating at the aliens' zoo with a movie star, and his insightful understanding of the Tralfamadorians'  concept and belief in a fourth dimension.  However, a sense of pride is developed for Billy Pilgrim as he uses this new understanding of time, believing that events repeatedly occur at a different time and place, in order to accept the difficult, sad and horrific eventsin his life; he is coping.  Occasionally, he struggles with the overwhelming impact of his life experiences and he has a nervous breakdown.  However, those breakdowns are used to illustrate the value of the belief in the fourth dimension and his acute sense of survival.    The author's seemingly jumbled delivery of Billy Pilgrim's experiences and significant life events serves to illustrate the insanity that provoks the protagonist to give up.  Throughout the story there are snapshots of both the author's and Billy Pilgrim's lives.  They are like small swatches of fabric, with different patterns, and no connections.  However, when pieced together they create a purposeful quilt that recounts difficult events in both Billy Pilgrim's and the author's lives, their apparent struggles, and their resolve to cope and survive.
1400063515|3.0|The basic premise, that future events are unknowable and consequently unpredictable, is not a new one.  We humans are stuck in the neverending rut of trying to prepare for future events by relying on the past, wasting time and money on creating narratives that deceive us into believing we have some false security or that we hold the key to success.  The governments spending dump in the wake of 9/11 on measures that are supposed to keep us safe is a prime example.  Although this book does a good job, if a bit flawed in prose, of articulating this point, it should be mentioned that this is not a novel argument.  Taleb's book held my attention but was wanting in the detail and research that I really desired.

0143038419|1.0|If I could give this book negative stars I would. I can read just about anything and like many of the other dissatisfied readers TRIED my darndest to enjoy this book. I too was unable to read past mid India. The breaking point for me was when she heard a story from her \\"dear friend\\" the Nat Geo photographer who had met men and women who had climbed Everest among other mind boggling and over achieving feats - and OF COURSE her response was to make it about HERSELF and how her spiritual enlightenment was far more impressive and superior. I threw the book down in disgust and never looked back. In no way do I admire this woman. As another reviewer said she is the type of woman you see at a cocktail party and run the other way. I don't at all pity or sympathize with her. It is truly sad that we, the reader are expected to.
B000P6XU5G|4.0|***THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY VERSION of \\"RIO BRAVO\\"***<br /><br />Apart from the fact that Ricky Nelson couldn't act to save his life (he plays the fast gun Colorado), the big revelation in Howard Hawks' High Noon rerun is Dean Martin who is just superb as the drink-obsessed Dutch - sidekick to sheriff John Wayne and his trusty buddy Walter Brennnan.<br /><br />The Blu Ray version is disappointing print wise for the opening credits - there's blocking, speckles on the print etc, but thankfully it doesn't stay that way for long. Although there are other weak points in the transfer later on in the movie, for about 90 % of the time I'd say it looks really good - not great - but certainly better than any other version of it that I've ever seen.<br /><br />There's a nighttime sequence where one of the bad guys hiding out in a barn near the prison tries to shoot John Wayne - it cuts to Dutch outside worried about his friend inside - the clarity of sweat and dirt on Dean Martin is wonderful to see - and startling. When Angie Dickenson is stopped by John Wayne at her bedroom door suspected of card shark tricks in the saloon she's just left below, her face and clothing look sensational too (what a beauiful woman she was). But then in other places there's a disappointing feeling of the focus being slightly off or the print's vibrancy being washed out.<br /><br />It might just be that in 1959 the colour process was not quite there yet, but you can't help but feel that if this negative had been given real care and effort - the print would have been a genuine joy to look at - rather than being something that just ellicits the word 'good' out of you every now and then.<br /><br />\\"Rio Bravo\\" is a very good transfer to Blu Ray, but like so many oldies that aren't treated to proper restoration, you can't help but feel that an opportunity was missed here - because it's a Western that's stood the test of time.

B000RZGIQ8|2.0|I bought Top Gun on Blu-Ray as my first BD disc, in part because it was relatively inexpensive, but also because I was excited to see the dogfight sequences in high def.    Unfortunately, it looks to me like only the dialog sequences were improved by the change in format.  The dogfights, the carrier take-offs and landings, and the other scenes with the (still cool and exciting F14 Tomcat) look like they are in standard def.    With that disappointment, it was hard to get excited by this movie.  The dialog is so painfully cheesy that unless you are are teenager, there was no real reason to watch it in the first place.
0071120009|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it was written by luminaries of the field, such as Kandel, Jessell, and Schwartz.<br />(If you do not recognize those names, just know that they are famous neuroscientists)<br /><br />As an introductory textbook, it might be a little bit overwhelming, but it is very useful if you just want to read about something a little bit more specific, such as audition (which was, incidentally, written by AJ Hudspeth- another luminary in the field of neuroscience).<br /><br />My complaints with the book are as follows:<br />1. Outdated- it has been nearly 10 years since it was last published; needless to say, a lot of new facts have been discovered. I would wait for the new version, which is due in 2010.<br />2. Not very well organized.<br />3. It seems to be a little bit geared towards medical students.<br /><br />Overall, every neuroscientist should probably have a copy on his shelf and it might be worth it for med students as well.<br />However, most undergrads will probably find it too dense and interested laypersons will not find it useful.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I have not read the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald the movie is based off but if it is as good as the movie, it's sure to be an American classic. To be honest I was expecting to be bored with this movie, I enjoy a good drama but prefer it with some suspense or even some action. That said, after sitting through the movie twice I can honestly say this is easily one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />The plot runs smoothly and never drags and keeps the plot flowing at a moderate pace. The plot itself is so simplistic, it is the basic story of one man's life, but told not only by told himself but the love of his life and her daughter. Don't expect any crazy twists that Brad Pitt's movies are known for just solid storytelling from start to finish.<br /><br />The cast is superb and never miss a beat. Whether it be the rather charming Brad Pitt as Benjamin or Taraji Henson as his well-to-do mother or even Cate Blanchett portraying the love of Benjamin's life, they all shine brightly. The amazing cast is also backed by some extremely intelligent dialog, by far some of the best in years. You find yourself drawn to the characters as they interact in Benjamin's life and when all is said and done they are as close to you as your closest friend.<br /><br />Their is some light humor added to the mix, such as a man randomly being hit by lightning, or Benjamin getting drunk for the first time and it is approached in a charming manner. Their is also a couple parts that have some action including several extremely moody pieces shot on water. The visuals are amazing and the wardrobes and sets truly make you feel as though you have stepped back in time.<br /><br />Well without chattering on and on I just would like to say that this is a movie that I believe even people whom aren't so interested in the more serious side of Drama's can enjoy. I highly recommend any one even slightly interested to get their hands on the movie at once. In my opinion there are no other movies to compare to this as it's tale is one of utterly undeniable originality. Thank you for reading and I hope that my review interested you and ultimately encouraged you to see the movie.this as it's tale is one of utterly undeniable originality.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|\\"What do you do when you're not sure?\\" asks Father Flynn of his congregation at the inception of \\"Doubt\\", a film that centers on the doubt of the truth, doubt of faith, doubt of the nature of man and doubt of self while delving into the controversial dilemma of child molestation within the Catholic church and the church's efforts to cover it up.  Winner of four Tony awards including Best Play in 2005, author John Patrick Shanley's superb story is one of the more smooth and succinct Broadway-to-Hollywood transitions to come along in a great while.<br /><br />It is a blustery winter in 1964 at the St. Nicholas Catholic Church.  Sister Aloysius (Streep), the principal of St. Nicholas Catholic primary school, presides over her students with fear and intimidation.  Though stern and seemingly mirthless on the surface, Aloysius is empowered by the grace of God and believes in the saving of her student's minds and souls through discipline and contrition.  Father Flynn (Hoffman), the new parish priest, views things differently, his friendly and newfangled approach bristling the staunchly traditional Sister Aloysius to a curious degree.  She views him from the beginning with a critical gaze, his aim to change things rustling her old feathers considerably, but it isn't until he takes a special interest in Donald Miller (the school's one and only black student) that the seeds of doubt are planted in her mind.  Sister James (Adams), a novice in her profession as well as in the ways of the world, thinks Flynn charming and believes his interest in Donald is with good intention.  But time and experience have Sister Aloysius believing otherwise and she begins digging deeper for the truth, those seeds of doubt now taking root in her heart.  All  the while Flynn rebukes her interrogations but oddly enough does everything except proclaim his innocence.  The peripatetic winds that Sister Aloysius complains of begin to mount in their intensity the further she prods into the situation, and when she and Flynn finally confront one another, a literal and figural storm has brewed, their fury towards one another brilliantly underscored by the blinding flash of lightning and the menacing roll of thunder from the heavens above them.<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\", much like its title, creeps into the subconscious, festering, and it is a masterpiece in all its subtleties, particularly its use of visual metaphor.  Whereas other films practically beat you over the head with suspense, \\"Doubt\\" whispers it in your ear, its calm, hushed tone provoking a more attentive eye and ear to its proceedings.  With John Patrick Shanley serving as writer and director for the adaptation of his successful stage play, \\"Doubt\\" remains nearly 100% intact and fully realized according to Shanley's vision.  Foregoing visual effects and tricky camera angles, the play's impact and presence on a stage comes through on screen, the simplistic beauty of its cinematography and the focus on its small but superior cast making it an exquisite film that centers solely on its deeply dramatic story.<br /><br />Each of the four roles is a labyrinthine ship commanded only by the best captain, and each actor navigates and mans their vessel with power and precision.  It comes as no surprise that all four actors were nominated for Oscars (though none of them won) as well as a nomination for Shanley for his screenplay (which lost out to \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", a HUGE upset in my humble opinion).  Adams nails the wide-eyed innocence of Sister James and offers a quiet intensity while Streep glowers, smirks and steadfastly barrels through as Sister Aloysius.  Hoffman imbues Flynn with an intriguing mixture of mischief and tenderness while at the same time suggesting with a glint of his eye a covertness that Sister Aloysius immediately detects.  Though Davis is only present for two scenes in the film's 104-minute runtime (one in which she doesn't even have any lines), her small role as Mrs. Miller is sublime, made memorable in her capable hands; she even manages to make one forget that a powerhouse like Streep is standing right there with her.<br /><br />This single disc DVD edition comes with some interesting extras, the most intriguing being a featurette entitled \\"Doubt: From Stage to Screen\\" in which Shanley shares his own thoughts and feelings about the play, its transition from stage to screen, commentary from its actors and an impromptu interview he conducted with Streep.  Shanley chose to shoot the film in the neighborhood he himself grew up in, centering his outdoor shots on the very intersection where he attended Catholic school in the Bronx.  He also managed to come into contact with Sister Margaret James (the very woman on whom the character Sister James is based) from the school he attended and she served as a technical advisor on the film, helping Streep and Adams with the application of their habits and rosaries.  \\"The Cast of Doubt\\" is a casual sit down with the four main actors, \\"Scoring Doubt\\" reviews composer Howard Shore's inspiration for the film's music and \\"The Sisters of Charity\\" offers an enlightening background on the origin of the Sisters of Charity of New York and the humbling, often thankless work of the nuns.<br /><br />Bottom line: Truly one of the best films of 2008, \\"Doubt\\" will leave a lasting impression on viewers who crave a good, absorbing drama that offers them the opportunity to form many different interpretations from its complex story.le hands; she even manages to make one forget that a powerhouse like Streep is standing right there with her.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|I enjoy Austen and most of the movie adpatations including Clueless and Bride and Prejudice, but this was just too much!  Little things bothered me a lot.  For all that the main character was an Austen fan, she had little or no concept of how to handle herself in that time.  Her clothes were way off the hook and the families acceptance of some strange, oddly  dressed stranger just appearing was unbeleiveable.  Plus her hair bothered me.  I am sorry but young unmarried women in that time did not go about with their hair down!  I couldn't even watch the whole movie, just got p$^&ed off and advanced through the scene selections to the end.  Kind of a cool idea, lost a lot in the reality!

0321544080|5.0|I highly recommend Joe McNally's book. Lots of practical lighting tips and a look at what it means to be an assignment photographer who reports to editors and directors of photography. Joes describes in detail about each photo presented and what was involved to make the photo. Many of the stories are quite funny too. All of the photos are excellent. Joe displays and lists all of his camera and lighting gear. Finally, if you buy the book and register it with the publisher, you can download for free an extra chapter as a PDF. That chapter is equally good. Overall, one of the best photo books I've read over the last 40 years.
B00110K62U|1.0|My wife and I both share a love of Les Mis - the story, the staging and the music.  We have had a VHS copy of the 1995 Anniversary Concert for some time and just jumped at the opportunity to get a digitally produced DVD to view on our new wide screen set.    We jumped too fast - believing that the other reviewers were perhaps too critical of the DVD quality.  The worst is true - they may have been too kind.    Not only does the DVD version lack the enhanced clarity we have come to expect from digital recordings - it also has technical flaws in the recording which causes occasional gaps and jumps in the video and audio.  It very honestly provides no better quality than our VHS version and has the additional technical flaws mentioned - on all DVD players I have tried it on.    I am disappointed in BBC for the quality - and disappointed in Amazon for continuing to distribute an article of such poor quality that it seems to have been poorly dubbed like a quick ripoff!    I would gladly pay BBC several times the current purchase price for a high quality reproduction of the original concert.  I am sure I am not alone.  C'mon Amazon - don't you have any influence on your suppliers?    BBC could make this right by replacing our terrible concert DVD.

None that I have ever read, not all of them combined, have been as useful as this one. In fact, I have recommended it to several people who have since bought copies and are having the same reaction that I had. I don't even remember how I happened to find this book, but it was a godsend. This book offers the absolute best handling of dialogue that I have ever read. Amazing stuff especially if you're writing fiction.

B0000042H4|3.0|Despite its legendary status based largely, I would imagine, on the presence of the peerless Nilsson at her prime and various other outstanding cast members, Culshaw's perplexing decision to use Hotter as the Wotan and Solti as conductor were casting disasters which mar much of the cycle.  In his book, Ring Resounding, Culshaw admits that Hotter was a compromise and felt he would be critized by one faction or the other if he did or didn't use Hotter.  The guy may have much experience and dramatic insight concerning the role, but his voice per se (never that great, even in its prime) is in such bad shape it's virtually unlistenable and even at times unbearable.  (Like hearing a bass baritone Gwyneth Jones)  I believe Joseph Metternich was still active at the time and would have been an ideal Wotan as evident on many recordings,  I don't know if he was under contract with Decca, but since EMI was (foolishly) not planning on a complete Ring at the time, perhaps they might have released him.      Solti's conducting is pretty mediocre (lacking in insight and clarity and articulation in the string writing due to overly rapid tempi, projects various pivotal orchestral sonorities poorly, narrow dynamic range, sameness of attacts and tonal quality within the orchestral choirs...etc...etc..) Most of the electronic tricks and sound effects seem either dated, obtrusive, unrealistic or just lacking in dramatic and/or musical taste.      The Leinsdorf Walkure initially on RCA is so far superior in every respect (Nilsson, London, Gorr, Vickers!) except maybe for some awkward edits, that it easily demonstrates Leinsdorf would have been the legitimate choice and I believe he was under contract with London Decca at the time!  His conducting can be best described as the exact opposite of the earlier description of Solti.  His interpretation contains all the hallmarks of first class Wagner conducting.  He was initially Bodansky's assistant at the Met as Bodansky was initially Mahler'sassistant in Vienna.  He was part a great tradition of Wagner conductor.  You figure it.  Solti did work with Toscanini for a short while, I think, at Salzburg, but he seems to have inherited most of Toscanini's worst characteristics rather than his best.      I was lucky enough to get my hands on the Bensar release of a complete uncut Met Ring from the early 60's (before their plug was pulled) with Leinsdorf conducting an excellent cast to boot (also including Nilsson).  Even though the sound isn't perfect, it's more than listenable and the musical quality of this great and unique work is audibly present.  Parts of this Ring are broadcast occasionally on the Sirius Met Network.  I can easily rate it among the best of my two dozen or so complete Ring cycles on CD...along with the Furtwangler (RAI early 50's), Janowsky (first digital on Eurodisc and like Furtwangler, follows all of Wagner's musical details such as the entrance of the male chorus in Gotterdammerung beginning with one then two choristers growing over several measures into the full chorus and not concerting various Walkure's lines in their big scene.)  Other great Rings are the Knappertsbusch (several are available from mid 50's, casts vary in quality), Moralt (late 40's excellent cast with suprisingly good sound), Bohm (also, in general great cast, mid 60's Bayreuth).  The Met Ring (Schenk production) on DVD is also excellent in nearly every respect.  (Biggest outright failure: the effect for Fafner in Siegfried.)  Levine is at his best.      I place the Solti Ring somewhere in the lower middle.      In closing I should mention that the Bensar release contains much of the original intermission features.  One of which was a great tongue in cheek discussion-argument between Boris Goldowsky and an equally adept opponent over whether Gotterdammerung is a Wagner music drams or a old fashioned bigger than life romantic grand opera a la Meyerbeer.  Of course, as we all know, it turns out to be both!!  (Siegfried's and Brunnhilde's immolation is the ultimate auto-de-fe!)
0441013597|2.0|Herbert has masterfully written a deep, fleshed-out, utterly unappealing world and filled it with complex characters who are impossible to relate to. Now that I have read it I will check the box on the back of my geek credentials and never pick this book up again.
1423101472|5.0|Riordan does not disappoint with his final conclusion to the series.  Packed with action, familiar characters, interesting plot twists, and creative mythological references, the book is worth a read for any Percy fan.  Though it's hard to say goodbye to Percy and friends, we can only wait for the next Camp Half-Blood series (and hope that the old characters get some appearances in there as well).
B001UE276A|5.0|Sounds of the Universe is Depeche's best album since Ultra, in my opinion of course. Exciter didn't excite me much...there was certainly an element or two missing there. And Playing the Angel is great, except the producer (same producer as SOTU) got a little too experimental and over-saturated the sound.     SOTU however, is very exciting, both creatively and audibly, and very well produced! From the SOTU session photos and blogs I've seen, Martin went a bit ape-crazy with the vintage gear and filled every nook & cranny he could find with it. So then, one *might* expect to hear early DM synth-pop? Not quite. SOTU progresses onward in the 21st century. But the soundscape is definitely remmeniscent of 70's and 80's electronica. You'll get a good taste of this with the opening track, \\"In Chains\\", as it opens much like an analogue synth version of an orchestral warm-up session. There is quite a bit less acoustical elements (ala Exciter), and more vintage analogue soundscapes, albeit, Martins guitars are still a main ingredient. Daves vocals couldn't be any better, he just get's better with age. Martin sings lead vocals for one song, Jezebel, for which he does in flawless fashion.     Recently, since writing my initial review, I bought this Deluxe Box set from Amazon for $72. This contains 3 discs, and 1 dvd (along with a bunch of other goodies). Disc 2 contains some bonus tracks, not found on the album. All sound great! My favorites are \\"Esque\\", a very ambient sounding track, unlike any DM song I've heard before. And \\"Oh Well\\" is also like no other DM song I've heard before - very EBM inspired. Also on disc #2 are six remixes from SOTU. Disc #3 contains 14 tracks of unadultrated demo tracks (quite interesting). The DVD blew my mind! In addition to SOTU and extra tracks mixed in 5.1 surround, there are session videos of the making of SOTU. Included are 5 complete session recordings (on video) of Martin, Dave, Fletch, and engineers/producers playing various songs, mostlyfrom SOTU. I almost like these recordings over the album versions especially \\"Come Back\\". I highly recommend buying the box version of SOTU over any other.     I can't say enough good things about SOTU, it's already a timeless favorite of mine! It stirs the spirit, and gets you in a good groove from start to finish. As with any symbious five-star Depeche album, it will take a few listens to really appreciate and discover The Sounds of the Universe.

B00079ZACM|5.0|A truly wonderful old-time movie, with epic battle scenes, top-tier actors, and with the restored color the movie looks great too. Based on the A.P. Mason novel, it retells the events of one of Britain's Sudan actions through the lives of four friends and soldiers, one of whom redeems himself by becoming a belated rescuer and hero to his friends, who are captured by the enemy. Sir Ralph Richardson looks like a teenager he's so young. The range of actors and extras is remarkable. They used real \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzies,\\" with their amazing hair, as extras. I thought it was just a nickname before. The camel infantry charges are breathtaking. At the beginning of the movie, stuffy, old British officers recount their exploits for the edification of the four young officer friends.  Ralph Richardson steals every scene he's in, although John Clements is ostensibly the star of the movie. It's a story of old-fashioned chivalry, bravery, and military values from a bygone era. They don't make 'em like this anymore.

0743243315|4.0|This was the first book that I read by Ms. Ali and she instantly became one of my favorite authors. I love to read and learn about different cultures and countries. Ms. Ali did not let me down. From her descriptive prose, I have been able to create an image of Bangladesh (and later London) - one that feels very real, including the sights, smells, dusty roads, etc.... As the characters developed, we were given glimpses into Bangladeshi and Muslim beliefs along with the Bengali people. It presented a nice introduction for the sheltered American. The story was simple: girl enters into arranged marriage, leaves her family behind, becomes the submissive partner, realizes her own self worth and finally stands on her own.  Unlike some readers, I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read. I recommend to those interested in immigrant life and those wishing to expose themselves to different cultures.

B001N26GFM|5.0|I read this book twice and did not shed a single tear. About a month after reading it a second time, I went on a study abroad trip entitled World War II and Its Aftermath in varies places in Europe. Of course a stop to Auschwitz was part of the program. This movie came out a few months after my trip. I went to see it and sobbed through the entire movie. I sobbed for two hours straight after the movie and anytime I thought about it.<br /><br />The heartwarming tale of Bruno and Shmuel is in their childhood innocence. No one really thinks about the child perspective of the time (for both parties) and I found the book (and the movie) to be innovative in that sense. Their friendship made a constant smile on my face through my tears.<br /><br />The heart wrenching, of course, is all the other events happening throughout the film.<br /><br />While the story is of course hard to handle because it is such a tragedy, the movie adaption was done well and I would encourage anyone to watch this film. It makes you think of things you never thought before when it comes to the darkest moment in human history
B00000292K|5.0|I don't even KNOW if I understand jazz.  Many times I sit there and wonder to myself if much of the jazz being played is nothing but saxophone noodling that carries on for WAY too long.  Sometimes I can't quite see the appeal of the musical genre, to be honest.      But other times, while sitting alone in the dark in my living room rocking chair with the CD player blasting (like tonight) I can REALLY get caught up in the feel, the beauty, the delightfully haunting atmosphere, and sometimes loving jazz to the point where I might even find myself wanting to memorize each sequence of notes that plays (which is probably more complicated than it sounds).  So I guess all this adds up to me possibly being on the verge of understanding jazz more as I get older BUT still struggling to know where I stand with jazz at the moment.    But I know one thing- Miles Davis \\"On the Corner\\" is REALLY darn good.  So good in fact, that it's amazing only 80-some people have reviewed the album here on amazon so far.      I STRONGLY recommend this album to all jazz AND rock fans.  I honestly think I hear some grooves on this album that remind me of those groundbreaking Jeff Beck albums he made in the mid 70's.  Maybe it's a coincidence, I don't know.  Rock fans would be able to appreciate this album I bet.      How can someone who doesn't have the same kind of knowledge, passion or understanding of jazz possibly convince you \\"On the Corner\\" is a masterpiece?  Well I can't.  I just don't know how to put into words how brilliant this album is.     I know one thing- ever since I discovered the Mahavishnu Orchestra back in the summer of 2007, my eyes have opened REAL wide to the possibilities of combining rock with jazz.  Talk about a perfect winning formula.  At least, when the right musicians are attempting to combine the two.    \\"On the Corner\\" is not all about jazz either- there's some really good guitar work near the beginning of the album that is *terrific* because it sounds so good.  Doesn't just SOUND good I mean- the notes that are playing actually ARE really good.  The same can be said for most of the music on the album.    I feel a couple of the songs linger a few minutes too long, and this might indicate I'm not yet ready to fully appreciate jazz at this moment in time, because a serious jazz fan would probably have NO complaints about the length of these pieces.  Still, I can't really complain about it, because there's a good chance the musical parts that feel overlong will eventually grow on me one day anyway.  Also, never underestimate sitting alone and absorbing the music as much as you possibly can, because this works too.    Another thing I want to mention is that I actually heard this album back in the summer of 2003 and, with a big head, I thought I was ready to dive into jazz.  HA!   I was *nowhere* near ready, so after attempting to listen to this album several times I just gave up and said to myself \\"Well that's it- I'm not ready for jazz yet, but at least I gave it a chance\\".    Well, six years later, I feel more focused and ready to explore jazz now that I've heard this fantastic album with a better understanding of Miles Davis intentions.   I wasn't ABOUT to give up on exploring a musical genre that can be rewarding to me just because I had (and sometimes continue to have) trouble understanding it.      Oh, and just so you know, I have the older CD version that was released in 1990, and the sound quality is AMAZINGLY good for its age.  Honestly, a lot of CDs that are ready to enter their 20th birthday pretty soon don't sound very good to me, but \\"On the Corner\\" surprisingly features really good sound quality.  Maybe the guitars are slightly pushed in the back so the funky rhythm can shine in the light, but it's not really noticeable enough for me to complain about it.  You can still make out the guitar and saxophone playing throughout the album.    So if you happen to be in the same boat as me (someone who doesn't know if they really like jazz or not and want to settle for buying a jazz album that's not very expensive just to be cautious) I can honestly say this older version of \\"On the Corner\\" really holds its own despite its age.    As for the music, early 70's jazz apparently ages with dignity as well.  I LOVE this album and I highly recommend it.

0345495004|3.0|I found the personality of Mamah Borthwick to be somewhat elusive in this fictional portrait of her, probably due to the paucity of historical information. I wanted to know Mamah and like her but couldn't quite grasp what Frank Lloyd Wright found so compelling about her. Was she warm, animated, brilliant? What were her faults? Was she tortured by guilt? Certainly in this novel she was, as exemplified by her reaction to the Faustian opera. Wright, on the other hand, was more vivid, with his arrogant charm and nonchalance with regard to bill paying. Also, the line between fact and fiction was blurred here, and I was curious as to whether Mattie's fate and even Mamah's visit to Boulder were based on fact. We know that Mamah followed her heart to the detriment of her family and had to wear a virtual scarlet letter for her behavior, skewered by the press and acquaintances alike. For me, though, this love story did not jump off the page. I expected an unfortunate outcome, but the super-tragic ending shocked and saddened me, just the same.

B000002UAO|1.0|The songs are all in a different order and I've just seen a face\\" is not even on it.  I don't know if it was a different release but the cover is the same.  Very disappointing because the order of the songs on the album told a story, and this is just a mixed-mesh of Beatles songs.
0140272658|4.0|The author writes in a clever and amusing style, his abrupt and unexpected changes in thought making for good belly laughs.  The book, while engaging, was written by a Brit, traveling in India, so many of the words, phrases and basic ideas may not communicate with the American reader. Its a good book to read intermittently since it is his writing voice, not the plot (which tends to drag out), that makes the book a fun read.
0525478183|4.0|Let my bias be known: John Green writes the books that I longed for as an adolescent, and that I would love my own (yet to be written) novels to be compared to one day.    Green certainly has prototypical female leads and male bonds, but the dynamics ring so true that one can hardly hold any pattern against him.        If you enjoy Paper Towns, try Thirteen Reasons Why (Jay Asher), and Star Girl (Jerry Spinelli).  The similarities make them no less enthralling, and all three will grasp your attention until the end.      This book, as with his others, will appeal to smart kids of either gender. (Go nerdfighters!)    The quotation in my review title is from Leonard Cohen's song Anthem.  The concept is a pivot point for Quentin, the main character of Paper Towns, though Cohen gets no credit.  (I merely find this surprising considering his careful attention to crediting other lyrics and poems.)
B000006OS2|1.0|This is a horrible copy of the original.  The color is bad throughout the movie.  There are lines in the picture like you would see if you were watching an old home movie.  The widescreen version is much better than this one.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Star Trek is back with a vengence. Seeing it last night at a Paramount Screening in Holywood was a treat for the mind and soul of all the Star Trek fans out there. You will not be dissappointed.<br />What suprised me the most? - Was it's humor and compassion for the characters. What a great story - bending and remolding the origional Star Trek lore - it still kept true to what is the best of STAR TREK.<br />You would think because of the advertising that Eric Banna and Winnona Ryder were major players in this film - if they are anything, they are more like guest stars.<br />Zachary Quinto, Chris Pine, Karl Urban, Bruce Greenwood and - Leonard Nimoy are MAJOR players in this movie. Yes Spock Prime as he is referred to - is pivital to this entire film. ANd there is an amazing paradox that you will see! Between Spock  - and --well I'll let you be surprised.<br />Even Sulu, Chekov and Scotty have major saving moments that you'll long remember after you leave the theatre.<br />And Uhura - she has a relationship - and you'll never guess with who...? There is a great backs tory - although short - about very young Kirk and very young Spock that will explain much of who they became to be.<br />Of course the effects are state of the art, the uniform and ship designs are sharp and refined - although the Bridge looks like they stopped off in Las Vegas and picked up a few pointers. The Bridge is so bright and colorful. And everything from Phasers to the Transporters got a new sleek look.<br />A very family film and a much needed  'reboot' or Star Trek! Great job J.J.! I was pleasantly surprised. When's the next one? 5-8-09am
0525421033|5.0|17 year-old Mia has a great life. Her parents are understanding former punks, she's a talented cellist and her boyfriend completely gets her. Then, one seemingly-innocent snow day changes Mia's life. With her day off from school, Mia, her brother and her parents go on a drive.    The next thing Mia knows, she's watching the paramedics pull her beaten body out of the car.    The accident has taken the lives of her family and Mia feels as if she won't be able to handle the pain. In her strange state where she can go anywhere but not be seen, Mia learns that it is her choice if she wants to fight to leave or die.    Throughout the novel, we see Mia as she contemplates her choice, a difficult one to make. Family and friends come in and out of her hospital and everything they say and do affects Mia's choice.    Finally, the day after her accident, Mia finally decides what she wants. That is, until one final person speaks who completely alters Mia's decision. The question is, is it best for her to stay or is it really her time to let go?    While topics like this have been explored before, I've never read a single book like If I Stay. It was heartrending and the method that Gayle Forman used was truly innovative. I love how the book went from present to past; it fully developed the characters and defined the relationships between them    The entire story is captivating, even though it simply revolves around one decision. I love how everything that mattered to Mia's decision was explored in the novel. Past experiences, the way the future would be...just everything.    The most important part, I think, is the way love is explored. The people who love Mia and the people who Mia loves are the ones that are the focus of Mia's decision. With her parents and brother gone, can everyone else's love be enough?    Everything about everyday life becomes important in If I Stay. Things that you might never have considered important may be the points that make or break a death-or-life decision.    *spoiler*    I think one of the most moving moments(for me, besides the ending) was the part where Mia's grandpa tells Mia that he understand if she chooses to die. It makes Mia's loss all the more evident. Her parents are gone, her brother is gone. Really, is there enough left for Mia to hold on to? If it were me...would it be enough for me to stay back for?    *Spoiler End*    If I Stay is a beautiful and sincere story of an ordinary girl who must make the hardest decision that she will ever have to face.    If I haven't made it obvious enough, I completely adored If I Stay. Make sure you pick this one up right away! .I've also read Gayle Forman's other book Sisters in Sanity and while it's not quite up to the par of If I Stay, if you need some extra reading, check that one out too :)
1423101499|4.0|Whilst I enjoyed the previous book, some elements left me a little dissatisfied.<br /><br />The Battle of the Labyrinth, however, entertains consistently throughout.<br /><br />The plot moves along quickly, new characters are introduced, old ones re-appear, and some surprisingly touching and thoughtful moments occur.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next one!
0141321008|4.0|Jim Hawkins is living a quiet life, helping his parents run an inn.  When an old pirate captain checks in, though, things change dramatically in Jim's life.  Soon there are dangerous men coming to visit and threaten the captain, and the man decides that Jim is the only one he can trust.<br /><br />When the captain dies, Jim finds himself with a map to treasure, and sets off with some old friends from town to follow the map.  On the high seas, they discover the treachery of much of their crew, and must decide how to escape the island with the treasure and their lives.<br /><br />This is a great adventure story, and Jim is a spunky and smart protagonist to narrate it.
B001RTP48G|5.0|This is by far the best from the PSB in a longtime. This is the kind of album you play really loud. Every track is a winner and on this expanded edition the dub mixes are even more exciting. This is not to be missed being placed in your collection. The one thing about PSB is they are consistent with their music and every release they have they just better the previous release. Get this now before the limited expanded edition is gone.
0061020680|4.0|Mort is a pretty ordinary awkward teen.  A liability on his family's farm, he is sent to seek an apprenticeship elsewhere.  Just when Mort thinks he is completely unwanted by anyone, he receives an offer--by Death.<br /><br />Working for Death actually isn't too bad.  Mort simply has to be there when someone's time has run out, to sever their ties to life.  In his off time, Mort lives at Death's home with his daughter and his servant.<br /><br />Death decides that Mort is ready to try the job on his own, while Death spends awhile exploring his own humanity.  But when Mort is sent to kill someone he really doesn't want dead, he takes action--an action that has ramifications for his world.<br /><br />This was a very amusing story, with great characters.  It managed to get across some of the important features of Discworld without being overwhelming or confusing.  I enjoyed reading this book.
B000000OQY|1.0|It's often overlooked that G'n'R was for all intents and purposes, just another hair band. What separates them from the avergage hair band in the vein of Posion, Whitesnake, Cinderella, and all of those other fallen heroes of 1980's power balladry is that their handlers carved for them an image that was a little bit more serious than the likes of Dave Coverdale or Bret Michaels. They had a bad boy, biker kind of image, perhaps a little more musical depth than the average hair band, and a penchant (most likely the result of managerial machinations) to court controversy. All of this combines to make them somewhat better than the average 80's hair band, but still worse than virtually everything else.    This isn't really an album. It's more of a stop gap in between AFD and its real follow up, UYI. This was probably another managerial machination to ensure that the band's newfound commercial success didn't languish in the four year space between the real albums. Still though it is a shining example of the steaming pound of feces that William \\"Axl\\" Bailey and company churned out with apparently little effort and even less intelligence.    The first part of this disc can best be viewed as a tour of Axl and company's roots. These tracks are musically dull and lyrically vapid. The boys break no new ground and the listener finds himself hoping against hope that they will if only so they may fall through the cracks.  Probably the most embarrassing track is \\"Mama Kin\\", but then anyone who willingly covers an Aerosmith song has clearly run out of self respect.    The real triumph of this brief eight track affair is the second half. All original material, all stripped down and performed mostly acoustically, and all very lame and stupid.     \\"Patience\\"- It takes more than a little patience to sit through this painfully dull and dreary paean to troubled relationships. William assures whoever the subject of the song is, whichever unfortunate woman was with him at the time (for themoney no doubt) '\\"sad woman take it slow and things will be just fine.\\" He is the image of the sensitive, enlightened male. In the midst of his own pain and torment, he is intuitively aware of the heart wrenching troubles for the other party as well. What a lad. Of course, many other lyrics throughout G'N'R's brief career would reveal him as an archetypal chauvinist, misogynist (not to mention his penchant for beating up women that he's engaged or married to). Indeed, what a lad. We must take his posturing as an emotionally mature, caring, and intelligent man with a pinch of salt and instead regard him as the snotty little pissant the rest of the album suggests him to be.     \\"Used To Love Her\\"- I think this one is just embarrassing. A sort of countryish rock ditty that at least in musical terms would not sound out of place on an Eagles album. Needless to say, it is trite and achingly lame musically, but the real measure of its egregious idiocy is in the lyrics. This was done for a laugh obviously and will appeal to anyone who finds the humor in all things sexist and cliched, as William evidently does. I can imagine middle aged beer swigging janitors or mechanics listening to this track and laughing uproariously when Bailey explains that she \\"b*tched so much, she drove me nuts\\" and \\"I can still her here complain\\". We also get a chance to hear one of Bailey's unique talents in that ultra annoying, moronic way he has of dragging out the last syllables of a word like some sort of Buddy Holly on smack; \\"complaiiiiin-aaaa-aaaain\\".    \\"You're Crazy\\"- Blues derivative in music and lyrics. Bailey sings about, what else? An unruly woman that's breaking his heart and causing him grief as the boys strum a blues derived, uninspiring, unmoving background noise.     \\"One in A Million\\"- To understand this one, we must first understand what Axl and company's handlers had devised as a basic modus operandi for marketing a group that wasn't really very talented and had the combined IQ's of a herd of sheep. Every G'N'R album contained about three or four very commercial and MTV friendly songs that were predictably promoted as singles. It was more often than not, really vacuous, sentimental ballads about lost love, tough love, love unrequited, blah, blah, blah. \\"Patience\\" was obviously like that. But to keep the rumors at bay that the boys were in reality just a bunch of limp wristed, sensitive balladeers (and probably also to distract from the peculiar juxtaposition of Axl the musical romantic and Axl the real time woman abuser) most of the rest of the album was filled with heavier, harder, and usually more aggressive and dark lyrics. This track is of note only for its lyrics. It is on the basis of its music, wholly unmemorable. In one, six minute song, William reveals himself as not only a very poor singer fronting a group of musicians who bring about as much depth and originality to guitar based rock as Journey does, but also as a bigot of multiple prejudices. Now he has already time and again unconsciously revealed himself as a likely misogynist so women are spared on this one. Instead William name checks all those other types (that ain't white and therefore not right) he despises in true imbecilic, apallingly ignorant fashion. From \\"immigrants and \\"f*aggots\\" to \\"police and n*ggers\\", one gets the feeling that no page of Mein Kampf was left unturned as our hero delved deep into his putrid soul for the inspiration to pen this homage to blatant generalizations, racial stereotypes, and just plain stupidity. Were they serious? Probably. Was it at least in part an attempt to generate controversy and raise some eyebrows, but shouldn't be taken literally? Maybe, but far from attempting (and failing) to absolve the band with this kind of logic, fans should ask themselves what kind of sad, desperate baffoons descend so low for the sake of publicity and attention? I'm susprised that didn't follow up with \\"One In Million Part 2\\" in which they could maybemock cancer patients or talk about pushing people out of wheelchairs. Maybe it's in the works given Chinese Democracy's poor showing. William must surely be in need of another desperate \\"look at us, we're so un-pc and naughty, it's like cool, man\\" ploy for attention now.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I went into this with an open mind and I was rewarded with one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've ever had. I have loved Star Trek since I was a kid and was more than a little apprehensive about this \\"reboot,\\" with different characters and a plot that didn't exactly fit the canon that has been built on for the last 40 years. I had faith though, because I like Fringe and LOST, and now I know it's true - everything J.J. Abrams touches turns to gold. The actors and writers did an incredible job of paying homage to the characters that we know and love, and yet the new things we hadn't seen before were totally believable. Yes, the story went in a new direction - but it built on everything that makes Star Trek enjoyable. The references to other series made me smile - \\"Admiral\\" Archer's dog, for example - these guys definitely did their homework. I was surprised by a few things, but definitely not disappointed. I think Gene and Majel would be impressed, and all of the original actors should feel honored with the respect paid to them. In some cases, the new actors (dare I say it?) played the characters better than we've seen before. McCoy was his crusty self, Kirk hit on just about every female but showed the utmost concern for the mission, his crew and his ship, Spock was eminently logical yet conflicted, Scotty was the miracle-worker. Sulu and Uhura were way more interesting than their original counterparts. Yet nothing was overdone...well maybe Chekov's accent (lol). The action sequences were incredible, the sound was so intense it felt like I was there - and the picture, wow... definitely see this in IMAX. The Enterprise never looked so good, and when all was said and done, I was left with something else that I haven't felt for a long time, if ever - I am PROUD to be a Star Trek fan. Mad props to everyone who was involved with this film. I was left speechless, and all I can say now is \\"More!\\"

Some of the slang used in the book gives it a distinctly dated English tone, but still very readable nevertheless. The book is a pure escapist fun, frivolous read for everyone!
B0018KSB5C|4.0|The Spiderman series has been consistent is producing good films with each one showing the growth of Peter Parker as he comes to terms with love, life and his responsibility attached with his super powers.

1400063515|5.0|The Black Swan is brilliant for a variety of reasons. Author Nassim Nicholas Taleb (NNT) voices many thoughts about the way the world works (and doesn't work) that lurk in the back of all of our minds. Taleb's worldview is unique, well informed, and in many respects shockingly accurate. Highly improbable events are what shape our world. The fact that they are unpredictable is frightening, but what makes Black Swans that much scarier is that after the fact, experts concoct \\"logical\\" explanations to make sense of it all.<br /><br />And Taleb is well positioned to say that the world is unpredictable, having been a highly paid \\"quant\\" or quantitative analyst, graduating from Wharton business school at a young age, and all the while modestly (and humorously) insisting to anyone that asks, that his job is a limo driver.<br /><br />NNT has a variety of unique perspectives that make this work well worth reading and continuing to ponder long after the book has been put down and completed:<br />- Taleb has a deep distrust of experts; \\"empty suits\\" that he feels in fact are no more capable in their predictions of the future than cabdrivers. They are just more eloquent in fooling themselves and their audiences.<br />- NNT is a sharp critic of \\"hotel journalism,\\" where reporters don't actually go out to get the story. He finds that there is so much overlap between newspapers that one actually decreases world knowledge the more one reads them.<br />- The author's command of such a variety of fields is remarkable and his description of the unread books on his shelf haunting him is inspirational.<br />- Taleb, like Thomas Friedman, interestingly feels that the United States is by far the most creative nation in the world and that this is the source of great competitive advantage.<br />- Experience can make you little prepared for the future; Taleb's Thanksgiving turkey analogy is mind-blowing and so true.<br />- Human beings tend to oversimplify the facts and tell stories following events in order to explain the truth, which then isn't the truth at all. We need narrative in our lives.<br /><br />And so on. I wasn't even able to get to the part where Taleb blasts the bell curve here, but other reviewers have more than adequately covered that aspect. I can't say enough about this book. If you want your eyes opened and your mind expanded, read The Black Swan.hich then isn't the truth at all. We need narrative in our lives.    And so on.

0767805712|5.0|This great science fiction story is both thought-provoking and entertaining. It is an update of the themes from earlier science fiction stories: \\"Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley and \\"Player Piano\\" by Kurt Vonnegut.  Genetic engineering leads to societal engineering which brings about alienation for those of us who are unfortunate mishaps.  The musical score is haunting, the acting hits the mark, the dialogue is clever and the sets are convicing.  The events in the story are frighteningly plausible with credible characters.  i am happy to have this as part of my DVD collection so I can view it again and share it with friends.

They gave Azzaro Pour Home 5 stars and called it an \\"all-time great.\\"  I am a fan of Azzaro Chrome, which they oddly gave a 2 star rating to, so I went ahead and purchased a 3.4 oz bottle of the original Azzaro. I hated it. It is for older men and these experts did not mention that. They also did not include any Banana Republic colognes which is ridiculous. Slate is one the best colognes I have ever smelled and while it is new, it still should have been listed. So for anyone out there, do not take their word and buy cologne or perfume. Test them out first.

It will leave a long lasting impression on you.I highly recommend it.
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|The new Star Trek movie was billed as not being your father's Star Trek, it's not. Due to the villain, Nero's (Eric Bana) entering a black hole and going back in time altering the time line and the destinies and relationships of the characters (one major relationship that goes unexplained) that hadn't existed before, now exists. Every generation reinterprets its myths and that's what Paramount is trying to do here, reboot Star Trek for a more action oriented younger audience.<br /><br />The essence of all the major characters are here, Chris Pine has the swagger, and at times seems to channel William Shatner without resorting to parody. Zachary Quinto is exemplary as Spock, Karl Urban playing McCoy is dead on, although, the repeated \\"damn it Jim, I'm a Doctor not a ....,\\" seems campy, but the backstory about why Kirk calls him Bones is excellent and funny. Zoe Saladana is given more to do as Uhura than usually is in Star Trek, John Cho seems like he could age to be George Takei. While I'm talking about the actors, Eric Bana turns in another bland performance, he doesn't seem very dangerous or threatening.<br /><br />Here is a couple of things to quibble over. The Kobahsi Maru simulation seems better in The Wrath of Khan. And would you really build a starship on earth?<br /><br />This Star Trek is high adventure, but Star Trek was also about substance within the adventure, that's what made it special and after you learn that the destinies these characters are leading is different from the destinies of the characters we've grown to know and love over the years, I lost a bit of interest, it wasn't what I bargained for, I was interested in seeing how those characters got together and created the crew of the Enterprise. It seems to me that from the original series there was enough outlining information that was vague enough to create an equally appealing adventure without discounting and destroying the histories of the characters we know. I hope that the future adventures of the Enterprise manage to get more substance into the adventure. If you're a Star Trek fan like I am, you're probably going to see this movie over the weekend. If you're a borderline fan and want to see it at the theaters, a matinee is probably the right price for this, and if you're on the fringes, you can probably wait for the DVD.ge to get more substance into the adventure.

B001P9KR8U|1.0|God, what an awful waste of time. I can't even say that this movie is bad. A bad movie gives you something to talk about. You can at least discuss with your friends just how much it sucked and why. You can analyze the particularly bad parts. Slumdog Millionaire, however, does not even allow for this harmless kind of fun. It is boring, repetitive, the characters are as dead as the story. And please don't tell me it's Bollywood. I know Bollywood films and I really like them. This feat of boredom has nothing to do with Bollywood. It's nothing but a silly attempt to gratify Westerners by exploring every stupid prejudice about India.<br /><br />It is self-evident, of course, that the current recession is the biggest reason behind this film's popularity. People enjoy watching this kind of desperate poverty because it makes them feel better about their own economic situation. Also, the whole \\"it's fate/destiny/kismet\\" rubbish always becomes popular during economically tough times. When people feel powerless, they turn fatalistic.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is one of the most exciting Trek films since Wrath of Khan and the Search for Spock. Years after a Romulan attack that killed his father, a thrill seeking farm boy, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) joins Star Fleet. He doesn't take it seriously and cheats on a test. Which doesn't impress Spock (Zachary Quinto) much since he's all for going by the rules. They don't get along, but a Romulan attack on the Enterprise they're on might just be enough to force them to work together.<br /><br />  I really enjoyed this movie. The cast was a lot of fun and everyone did a good job in their roles. I was surprised how well Karl Urban played Bones. He wouldn't have been my first choice for the role either. Zachary Quinto comfortably plays Spock as well and plays the part perfectly. While Chris Pine is more of a gun-ho Kirk than I'm used to,. He is perfectly cocky as him though. Zoe Saldana wasn't bad as Uhura but my only problem with the movie is how she was used. I mean, I don't remember a Spock, Kirk and Uhura love triangle in the original series or movies lol. Spock making-out with her just felt wrong. But I was still entertained by the look on Kirk's face witnessing it.<br /><br />  I'm not used to a Star Trek film where Spock is a stud or one with some bad language either. While  the space battles were a bit better in previous films. I still found a lot of the film exciting and fun though. Which is something I haven't felt watching a Star Trek film in awhile.

Bossa Nova type of music is something I've long enjoyed without really knowing what it was.<br /><br />Based on the one song I heard on the radio (A Ra) I purchased the CD and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />I saw mention that 'Girl from Ipanema\\" has been over done, but honestly I don't tire of hearing any version of that song.<br /><br />I've let this CD run many night as I fall asleep as well I've let it run in the background during dinner.  It's such as easy and pleasant CD to listen to over and again.
0441013597|5.0|Any genuine understanding of science fiction begins with Dune.  It is not only a quantum leap ahead of anything from its time, it is arguably still today rarely equaled and even more seldom surpassed, in spite of the fact that Frank Herbert's successors have his own work (and all of the ensuing derivative work from the intervening decades) to guide them.    Although Herbert originally wrote six Dune novels, I have come to think of the first three as a single work, simply because I never feel like I am done reading if I stop at the end of the first or even the second book.  So this review should be considered to regard Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune.  If you are not willing to read at least those three (and the second three, while worthwhile, are much less contiguous and less indispensable), you are missing a good deal of what is great about this work.    The first word that comes to mind to describe Dune is \\"smart.\\"  Herbert's main writing innovation is the amount that he leaves out.  Although the POV is omniscient, it is still the POV of an omniscient in Herbert's world and not in ours.  So, there is much that could have been written to acclimate a visitor from our world to the world of Dune.  Herbert's mastery is in leaving it all out, and still leaving you totally aware (at least, if you are paying careful attention) of what you didn't read explicitly.  The author never underestimates his readers, instead making leaps in narrative, character arc, and history, and expecting you to follow.  You find yourself rising to the challenge, and feel smarter just by virtue of having read and understood.    The characters are also \\"smart.\\"  I have read science fiction from childhood on, and the more I read, the more I am amazed at how intelligent the characters in Dune are.  There are factions within factions, schemes within schemes, bitterly opposed and fully developed characters locked in truly epic struggles for their own survival, the survival of their respective dynasties, and the success of plans whose maturity is measured in millennia.  And the best part is, none of these characters need to be described as geniuses--we already know that just by reading.    There is an old political joke that a candidate, when asked how he will address a given problem, answers \\"I'll just imagine a guy smarter than me, then do what he would do.\\"  Obviously, it's not that easy.  The same concept holds in writing fiction--it is impossible for a character to be both well developed and smarter than the author.  This is doubly true in science fiction, where the myriad plot and character threads must intertwine with a society truly alien from our own, which nonetheless has a dazzling array of strictures in its religious, political, economic, and metaphysical aspects, all of which must be consistent and believable.  Herbert set an extremely ambitious goal in creating the world of Dune, and the cast of characters with which to populate it.  And he accomplishes that goal in grand style.  It is the literary equivalent of knocking one out of the park, in the bottom of the ninth of World Series game 7.    If you like science fiction and have not read Dune, you will be astounded at what you have been missing.  If you do not (yet) like science fiction, you may find it both too dense and too vague, as a certain amount of literacy in the genre is required before you can confidently fill in the blanks and make the leaps required by the text.  It is the book equivalent of a movie where you can't miss a moment, for fear of not understanding something later on.  That said, you shouldn't let the book intimidate you, as it is a real pleasure to read.  If I got more out of it in my 30's than I did in my teens, that is only to be expected.  But whenever I have read it, I have been not only entertained, but broadened, awakened--in a word, edified.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|I have been in love with this mini-series since Tom Hanks first put it on HBO. Being former NASA, I love the look back at a time when the United States was the best in space. All the more poignant when you consider how far this nation has declined in the decades since Apollo.    This should be in your DVD library; a reminder of those times long gone when the USA could still accomplish whatever we put our minds to.

0375707972|5.0|Bernhard Schlink's The Reader is a storyteller's masterpiece, featuring Homeric similes, profound psychological insights, memorable and fully developed and motivated characters who struggle with difficult ethical dilemmas, and unforgettable vignettes of the Holocaust, all told in simple, direct, unadorned prose. It is much more complex and nuanced than the movie that it inspired, and the fact that its author is a German professor of law dealing with Teutonic generational guilt renders its success all the more stunning.

I just think she needed to be inspired by Celine, Whitney, and Early Mariah's music. They are known to make great ballads because they put more passion into to it to make the songs more lively. She could even do songs like Anita Baker. She did well performing \\"Sweet Love\\" on her tour. If she had done this, her songs would have came out to be superb and she would have gotten better reviews on this cd. However, the songs on the Sasha Fierce side were more fun to listen to. Single Ladies is my favorite and addicting. I love Diva. Ego and Video Phone are good songs. If it wasn't for the Sasha Fierce side, I would probably have given this cd a 2 or 1. But i think it's great that she decided to take risk to do one cd that consist mostly of pop ballads, she just needed better inspirations.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|There seem to be two films here:  The first half is a lovely exploration of the relationship between a very young boy and an older woman, beautifully captured by its two actors.  Newcomer David Kross turns in a fine performance that fully captures the confusion and abundant sexuality of adolescence, and Kate Winslet surely earned her Oscar®.  Alas, the story loses its grip on us in the second half, wherein the author begins to manipulate us with serial improbabilities, utterly false plot turns, and shallow moralizing.  Worse, we are made to endure yet another brooding portrait of misery from actor Ralph Fiennes.  No actor in my experience has ever become so tedious and predictable.  By the time we get to the war crimes trial, I, for one, refuse to believe that the young man just happened upon the trial of his former lover, or that he just happened to be a law student, or that she would refuse to confess her illiteracy to avoid a life sentence, or that he would likewise refuse to reveal her secret.  The author has created a most improbable straw woman in furtherance of his shallow moralizing.  What we have here is the kind of story designed to make Book Club members (Oprah!) feel that they have grappled with a very difficult subject, when, in truth, they have merely experienced a pale and shallow version of a very large and difficult subject - that of German war guilt.  So it is with this film, which is content to exploit the Holocaust as a plot device (always a sure way to get noticed at Oscar® season).  For example, our hero is seen in one sequence touring one of the concentration camps:  Gazing forlornly through the barbed wire; walking down a long hall full of empty shoes; meditating in front of the ovens, etc.  Aside from the fact that a real camp would be thronged with tourists, not empty as it is here, these scenes are merely cheap shorthand meant to manipulate us and instill a generic sense of guilt.  In the penultimate scene (surely meant to drip with irony and meaning), the author of a Holocaust memoir who had testified at the original trial, now a very wealthy woman in a fabulous art-filled apartment (Holocaust memoirs, it seems, can be very lucrative), sanctimoniously refuses the few dollars willed to her by the guilty woman:  All possibility of redemption and innocence is forbidden.  Poor Ralph Fiennes' character must carry his guilt a little longer, until he finally confesses his story to his daughter.  The mantra \\"confession is good for the soul\\" has become the chief cliché of our age.    The film itself is very nicely made and photographed, with excellent period detail.  Both the director and the screenwriter are very talented people - it is quite difficult to successfully translate a literary first-person narrative into a film narrative, and it is nicely done here.  One only wishes that they had better taste in books.

B001CTDH76|5.0|The Mentalist is one of those shows where you can kind of miss one episode and still be caught up. It's kind of the same in every episode, like Scooby-Doo, but the tricks Patrick Jane uses, are different. See Patrick Jane(Simon Baker) used to be a fake Psychic, but after he insulted a serial killer on television, the serial killer basically slayed his wife and his daughter. He gave up that life to help out the CBI solve cases with his extraordinary abilities to read deep into a situation. He can hypnotize people, and he also tricks people into telling him what he wants to know. He can do things that no ordinary person can do. While he's helping the CBI, he's on his own search for Red John, the serial killer. Patrick is very tortured and he protects his inner self with much difficulty. He puts up a front, to protect people from seeing the pain he's under. Simon Baker plays the part well, having a similar part with The Guardian. Simon Baker is amazing, and Robin Tunney (Agent Lisbon) and the others, help support the roles excellent. If you want a good detective type show, without all the flashbacks and gore like CSI, this is great for you.   Enjoy!
B0026PA05M|5.0|We saw Halestorm open the 98RockFest in Tampa this year, talk about an attention getter! When her voice blasted thru the system I was amazed, Who is this? I had to know! They were exceptional live, rocked hard and full of energy, one of those bands that is made to play live without losing anything from their music. The cd compiles fast rock hard tracks with catchy riffs and lyrics with some slower ballad type songs that are worthy. Very clear cut lyrics, you actually understand them when she sings, the band is fantastic too, well played. We likened the drummer to ANIMAL from the muppets when we saw them, dude roked it hard! GET THIS ALBUM, support true musicians.

0375831002|5.0|I don't know that I have thought this about a book before, but it felt like an absolute privilege to be able to read \\"The Book Thief\\" by Markus Zusak. It was the first selection of our new book group, and I think it will be a hard act to follow. The book is so imaginative and lyrical--just amazing when you consider it is narrated by Death and takes place in Nazi Germany. The author is so inventive in his style and narration--he tells you almost from the beginning what is going to happen, and it still catches you by surprise. The characters are unforgettable. I also don't remember ever learning so much from a work of fiction--not about history so much as human nature. Also, for anyone who loves reading, this is a book about the power of words.

1401307957|5.0|This book was required for a typography class I entered this Spring.  While I thought it seemed like an interesting read, I wasn't sure what to expect.  This is a very spirited book that encourages the artist in all of us.  It also is wonderful to see art as therapy in a tragic event, and see it helping someone to come out of the mire, discovering the beauty in the new.  A colorful meld of philosophy and art, coupled with the everyday \\"Joe\\" we can all relate to with a good sense of humor, and humanistic tendencies of emotion, this book gets a big thumbs up from me.

B000YI7MRM|2.0|Spain's most expensive film to date, Alatriste is the kind of film that, in theory at least, is right up my alley: a historical epic about a professional soldier in the various Spanish Wars of the 17th century. Unfortunately rather than pick one of the five books with the character written at the time, the producers and writer-director Agustin Diaz Yanes bizarrely try to fill all of them into a 145-minute film, which strangely enough doesn't result in a fast-paced film that races from one half-realized scene to the next but rather results in lots of rather slow and sedate scenes that just happen without too much regard for what comes before or after them - they're just there before the film moves on to the next bit they've decided to use,  rather like the way early silent movies would bill themselves as Scenes From Ben-Hur or Scenes from MacBeth. It doesn't help that Viggo Mortensen underplays to the point of semi-comatose, leaving the film with no panache and no-one to really interest you: it's hard to shake the feeling that original choice Antonio Banderas could have put some much-needed fire into the part. It's very handsomely produced even if the budget constraints mean it's the kind of film where you never even see the cities its armies besiege, but when you're an hour into the film and the only moment that particularly impresses is a brief scene of tunnel-fighting in the trenches, you know this isn't going to get much better.    The film sort of picks up around the middle with a fairly good ambush on board a galleon, and there's an okay battle scene before the film finishes (it doesn't really have a climax, it just sort of... stops), but it's one of those films where nothing really comes of it all. Plots are set in motion yet never resolved, conspiracies partially uncovered and then forgotten and characters reappear and disappear without ever leaving you that much the wiser or more entertained. There's absolutely no sense of momentum and not much of a story orcharacter to compensate. You know about as much about the hero at the end as you did five minutes into the film, and nothing he does ever ultimately matters - indeed, for all the throat-cutting on display he doesn't even despatch his arch-enemy himself (though quite why the man is his arch-enemy is never really gone into either). With a better script and a more charismatic lead the film could have made something out of a hero who fights his way through life on the sidelines of history without ever making a real difference, but sadly this one leaves wondering why he merited a movie of his own. A TV series along the same lines as Sharpe would have been a much better idea than this rather dull outing. And casting a woman as a plotting member of the Inquisition was an especially silly idea...
068987474X|3.0|The basic point of this book is true. Trouble is, it's not hard to guess why this book was written.     It was written for girls who are out there wondering \\"Why does he ignore me?\\" etc.     The answer is often that women tend to always want guys who don't want them.     I'm sure other guys reading this have had this experience:     1. Go out with a girl.   2. She stops  returning your calls messages etc.  3. Guy thinks she's playing hard to get, so persists  4. Persistence doesn't work.  5. Guy says \\"the hell with it\\" and looses interest. This chick is frustrating, and a loser. He's less attracted to her than ever.   6. Suddenly, now that the guy has truly lost interest,  the girl starts texting and calling him.  Now that he could care less, she's interested!     What does a guy take away from this experience?     The more interested you act, the less interested she will be in him.  He regards his past feelings for this woman, and any other women, as dumb.     So aloofness becomes a regular part of his life.     Not the kind of thing people like to hear, but it's true.     Why is he not into you? Because you don't want him to be. Chances every woman who reads this book had a guy in her past that WAS into her that she kicked to the ditch.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I was somewhat skeptical when I ordered the triggers but, with so many glowing reviews, I decided that ordering them was a small risk worth taking.<br /><br />Well... now I'm a believer :)<br /><br />I fully agree with all who stated that the 'real triggers' should have been part of the controller's design to begin with. It's almost incredible how much better grip you can get with the triggers on top of the '2' buttons and how much quicker the reflexes appear to be. Now, that the triggers are in place, I don't believe I could ever want to play a shooting game without them on.<br /><br />I first thought of taking off one star for the price - it's really 10 cents worth of plastic - but, then, someone was creative enough to fix what is clearly a design error and whomever did it deserves a fair reward. So it's five-stars in spite of the rather inflated price.

0312117337|5.0|I used to use a set of Rider Waite cards but always found that they answered in a slightly group orientated way that always talked about people and their relationship to each other. I never felt that they were showing the behind the scenes reasons, just the people reasons. I looked and looked and found only tarot decks that spoke of people's problems with we each other.<br /><br />A few years ago I purchased a set of your Osho Zen Tarot cards. On opening the pack I was immediately surprised to see that none of the cards spoke of blame, just the reader and situations. The cards show moments of stillness and honestly with myself, where the attention is not on other people and how they do things to me (as in other packs) but more of a 'me and my behind the scenes'. Your product has gently guided me to take responsibility for areas in my life for the better.<br /><br />The artwork communicates where other packs have to be interpreted.

B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I also have just finished watching Star Trek XI and I must say that I am very satisfied with the film. The cast fit the roles of the characters perfectly and it almost felt like I had to take a second glance when Quinto was on screen as Spock. He did a remarkable job and was like watching a young Nimoy all over again! Everyone else in the cast was great, but like in the original series, the characters of Chekov and Sulu are used very little. I would have liked to have seen more of them in the film. I brag about Quinto's Spock, but I would almost say that Urban's McCoy really stole the show. He really nails down Bones' accent and mannerisms perfectly.<br /><br />The story was written well and had a lot of references for Trekkies to pick up on, and even had a Tribble thrown in for good measure. I especially liked the mention of a particular person and his pet from the TV series Enterprise. That was a nice little line for the fans of ENT.<br /><br />I couldn't help but be impressed with Nero's monster ship which he uses to get around in the movie. It is actually quite a beast on the big theater screen. It is easy to tell that you are definitely helpless against a ship that big. The Enterprise (with all of the new changes) looked really good inside and out. In my short review of the film, I would say that it is very much worth seeing. By the end of the film, it definitely felt like Trek. With all of the changes that happen by the end of the movie, I can't wait to see where the story goes from here! The slate is practically clean to write some new storylines that can be just as interest and probably even better.

B001U0HBPQ|4.0|C'mon, you know the plot!  Do you really need a synopsis?<br /><br />Benjamin Button was last year's ultimate Oscar bate film.  It has everything the Academy loves: epic scope, movie stars doing drama, a gimmicky concept, and a bitter sweet conclusion.  Plus, it was directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of the modern era, David Fincher.  Like previous Fincher outtings we get great photography, and extreme attention to detail, whether it be period or character beats.  The film's ultimate problem, at least for me, was that the whole concept of physically aging in reverse doesn't have as much of a theme impact as I had hoped.<br /><br />The acting is all top notch.  Though I would question how one would gage Brad Pitt's performance considering he's playing something totally unnatural to any living thing in the whole world.  But, based on emotional and charismatic charm he gets an A plus.  Cate Blanchett has been one my of all time favorite actors for a really long time now.  She's like the modern Meryll Streep, no matter if the film is bad or good, she's always on her game.  My only gripe with these two comes towards the center of the film's narrative, when they're both roughly the same age in literal terms and looks.  The film fizzles a bit.  The romance just doesn't ignite the screen and things get a bit water-logged until the next conflict, which should be obvious, finally arrives.<br /><br />I really can't stand framing devices in any film.  How much better would Saving Private Ryan have been if we didn't open and end the film with the old man version of Ryan?  I think a bunch.  This film has two framing devices.  One involving the death bed ridden Blanchet character and an old clock maker who lost his son in WWI.  I instantly groaned, but as the film went on both framing devices held some surprises that made them more emotionally relevant then usual, especially the clock maker.  The final image explains its reason for being, as well as why the modern part of the film takes place during Hurricane Katrina.  It's not spoon fed folks, so turn your brains up to eleven.  Or don't, I heard they made another Street Fighter film for you to check out.<br /><br />Besides Fincher's extreme attention for detail he is also well loved for his use of special effects.  He always uses the most cutting edge visual effects and then hides them, and always uses them to tell the story better.  This film finally in a long while brings us visual effects that A). We haven't seen before and B). Aren't the point for the film's existance.  The effects, make-up and visual, in this film are so fantastic and seamless that it's worth picking up the Criterion 2 disc special edtion just for the second disc's in depth breakdowns of how they did it.  Plus, the first disc has a Fincher running commentary, and for me that's the special feature I care the most about.<br /><br />The major problem with this film is that the idea of Benjamin aging in reverse comes off more like a gimmick then a necessity to the story.  Would it have changed the story that much if Benjamin was born normal?  Sure, I get what the film is going for.  It's one of the few big Hollywood films I've seen that was all about death, was obsessed with the art of dying and aging and the natural course of life.  I just don't feel the gimmick and theme have as much connectivity as they should or could've.<br /><br />I can't not recommend the film though.  It's very entertaining and never drags, even though it runs two hours and forty minutes.  The visuals are breathtaking and the aging gimmick is truly intriguing.  It's a very somberly toned film, so don't go expecting a bubbley romp of the likes of Forrest Gump.  Its Fincher, so if you've seen his previous works you know the man likes to paint his pictures in the dark.  This is the litest film he's ever made, but the tone poem contained is still as somber as anything he's ever directed.<br /><br />I for one hold this film up with The Game, Alien 3 and Panic Room in the Fincher canon.  It's good but nothing brilliant.  He's done brillaint already with Seven, Fight Club, and the truly masterful and unfortunately overlooked masterpiece Zodiac.  That's probably his greatest cinematic achievment and Benjamin Button hasn't changed that.nothing brilliant.

The book is a compelling documentary written from a personal and realistic point of view.  The author expertly details the devastating effects of foreign aid to the countries in Africa and why alternative measures, i.e., self-sustaining government rule, would provide more positive, long-lasting outcomes.
1401923119|5.0|This is a book that needs to be read over and over. A lay person can read it and understand nearly everything written. The message can be life changing - if you are looking - because it gives very concrete reasons for the 'new' paradigm. It raises your awareness to the most unseen, and thereby gives a solid reason to be positive.

B00005JLPK|5.0|This was truly a remarkable movie for me.  Loved it and each time I watch it I learn a little more about \\"human nature\\".  Selma was magnificent in this movie.    Based on a real life character and her ambitions.... \\"not\\" to give up and to be her own person.  I loved this movie, but some may not approve of all the subject matter.  Recommended for open-minded viewer.

It is impressive, and Every Catholic Should be sure to Get A **Catholic Bible** The Real Thing, with all The books in it, which Catholic bible to choose is hard to say, I have heard the RSV is one to get, As long as it is The Original And Not KJV**protestant** then it is okay.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button deals with life and interpersonal relationships with a degree of sophistication and artistic quality that few films ever accomplish. It moved me very deeply and I am extremely impressed by this film. At first blush it would appear to be a somewhat bizarre or even silly story about a man who ages backward and the people he meets in life; but it is so much more than that. The issues of life and death, love, compassion, loss, joy and suffering are all explored quite well in this movie; and the plot moves along at a very good pace. I was never once bored despite the fact that it runs roughly 2 and ¾ hours. The acting is superlative; Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett turn in stunning performances that prove they have the talent to be superstars for quite some while to come.<br /><br />When the action starts, a young boy is born to a mother who dies after giving birth. The father is horrified at the infant's appearance of being elderly despite being the size of an infant; and he dumps the baby on the doorstep of a home for elderly people run by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). Queenie has a heart of gold; she accepts the infant into her home and raises him as her own--she even names him Benjamin. As time passes, we see Benjamin grow younger; and at age 7 he is finally able to get out of his wheelchair and take his first few steps during a gospel-style church meeting.<br /><br />Benjamin soon meets the very young Daisy, who captures his attention and becomes the love of his life. When he appears elderly he is in fact quite young so they even play together; but when he gets older (and a bit younger in appearance) he leaves home and writes to Daisy regularly as he sails on a tugboat with Captain Mike (Jared Harris) and Mike's crew. Mike and Benjamin form a true bond and when the Second World War erupts there's they see quite a bit of action that results in very tragic consequences. From time to time Benjamin's life intersects with Daisy's although they never seem to meet quite under the right set of circumstances--at least, that is, until the 1960s when he (Brad Pitt) is getting younger and she (Cate Blanchett) is getting older. But enough of that--I won't give away too many spoilers here!<br /><br />Benjamin meets several interesting people along the way--there's his affair with Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton), the wife of a British spy in the former Soviet Union; and he eventually meets his father who leaves the family button business to Benjamin after he dies. However, Benjamin refuses to recognize him as his real father; he still refers to Queenie as his mother.<br /><br />What about Daisy and Benjamin? When they do meet halfway through life, what comes of it? Do they marry and stay together; or do problems crop up? Will Benjamin take to the family's button business or will he remain a somewhat free and innocent spirit? And the film opens with an elderly woman on her deathbed in a hospital--who is she? Who is her daughter? Why do they matter in this film? Watch and find out!<br /><br />The 2 DVD Criterion Collection of this film has a plethora of extras on the second DVD. The DVD that has the film on it includes an optional running commentary with director David Fincher. The 2nd DVD has extras including featurettes about the production, visual effects and makeup; stills galleries; a good look at costume design and the costume gallery for the movie; a featurette about the musical score and another featurette about the premiere of the film. You won't be at a loss for things to watch!<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for anyone who appreciates artistic films exploring the meaningful issues of life, death, hope, joy, compassion, love and loss; and of course this is a must-have movie for fans of the actors in this movie.m to meet quite under the right set of circumstances--at least, that is, until the 1960s when he (Brad Pitt) is getting younger and she (Cate Blanchett) is getting older.

B00280LYHS|5.0|I can't describe in words how awesomme this series is. the only bad part was the fact that it ended.
B00004XMV6|3.0|This was far better than Wild Orchid, but along the same line.  Done in better taste but still had no real story line.  This was a very popular movie in the day.  Years later...I can only say it was popular for it's light \\"erotica\\" scenes.  But...it's probably still a \\"classic\\" for it's day.
B001QB9H1K|3.0|I think Statham can act, but with martial arts skills and a ripped bod like that, no one really cares. He is what he is and apart from the really annoying girl, this was a fun ride. The films are even able to poke fun at themselves and the fight scenes always manage to be that little bit different. The end was super if a bit silly on the bridge, the train was terrific. Frank Martin rocks! And the scenery was all gorgeous. Go figure that in an action film.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Worrisome Heart by Melody Gardot showcases Melody's extraordinary ability to sing write, and play piano with a great deal of sensitivity and she doesn't let us down a single time on this album. Melody has an abundance of talent and the thrilling part is that she's still really just getting started. The quality of the sound on this album is excellent; and I love that artwork.<br /><br />The album opens with the title track, a jazzy, bluesy number that has Melody singing with all her heart and soul. Melody's voice is absolutely beautiful to hear; she sounds as clear as a bell and her vocal range is very good. The musical arrangement makes good use of the piano, horn, guitar and percussion. I love it! When Melody sings that she \\"(needs) a hand with (her) worrisome heart,\\" I want to reach out to her as if I could touch her right there and sooth her pain--she makes this all THAT good. What a chanteuse! In addition, \\"All That I Need Is Love\\" has Melody handling complex tempo and key changes like the pro she is--and that guitar work is very easy on the ear. \\"All That I Need Is Love\\" explores the feelings of a woman who wants a man to truly love her instead of having a superficial relationship; this ballad strikes me with its beauty--wow!<br /><br />\\"Gone\\" makes good use of the string instruments and Melody sings this somewhat melancholy song to perfection--and beyond. Melody never skips a beat and she doesn't let go of a superfluous note, either! I'm very impressed; this gal deserves a spotlight, to say the least. \\"Sweet Memory\\" is another fine number; Melody's singing is front and center but the music that plays complements her vocals faultlessly. \\"Sweet Memory\\" is another very sophisticated number; Melody sings of a woman who remembers a past love even though she knows that she'll want another love soon.<br /><br />\\"Some Lessons\\" has Melody pouring her heart and soul into this rather bluesy ballad; and it creates quite an emotional effect. \\"Quiet Fire\\" has a terrific musical arrangement and when Melody Gardot performs on \\"Quiet Fire\\" you can really see her star beginning to shine very brightly! Melody is not going away anytime soon.<br /><br />\\"One Day\\" again features the wonderful talents of Melody Gardot; she delivers this like a champ and \\"One Day\\" is easily another major highlight of this album. Will the person Melody sings of become her partner? Maybe so--we can certainly hope! \\"Love Me Like A River Does\\" again has a fine piano arrangement while Melody sings this number with great feeling. \\"Goodnite\\" is a tender ballad that charms me with its natural beauty. Melody Gardot sounds terrific on \\"Goodnite\\" and I could never tire of hearing her sing this tune. The CD also ends well with Melody performing \\"Twilight.\\" \\"Twilight' has a somewhat exotic musical arrangement that is rather pretty and it leaves me wanting more.<br /><br />Melody Gardot is clearly going places fast. This album, along with her latest CD, points to truly legendary stardom. I highly recommend this album for fans of Melody Gardot; and people who enjoy jazzy numbers with some blues mixed in will not be disappointed.hen Melody Gardot performs on \\"Quiet Fire\\" you can really see her star beginning to shine very brightly!

B0002CHIJW|1.0|After no word for three weeks I was sent a message that I had been sent notice that the product was unavailable.  Not true.  The message arrived the day after the last day that I was to expect it.  I would have appreciated a timely message so I could look somewhere else.  Instead the import CD wasted three weeks of my time.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|I truly loved this movie.  The story was great even if it was \\"beefed\\" up in places.    They couldn't have picked two greater performer's as a match, than these two.  Of course I have been an avid admirer of Joaquin's acting since I first saw him.      Reese shows you that she is \\"much more\\" than a \\"dumb blone\\" and she's adorable.  Great...a must have for your Library.
0307408833|2.0|I preordered this book because the bakery has such a great reputation. As soon as it came I read it cover to cover. I was so excited to have a vegan gluten free baking book. That was yesterday. I was soon very disappointed because 13 of the recipes in this book are not gluten free. That's about a third of the recipes total, not counting the few drink recipes in the back.     The recipes are actually vegan and mainly sugar free. Many of the recipes call for a cup or more of agave nectar. Very little evaporated cane juice is listed.    A book that is advertised as gluten free and even says it in the subtitle should be gluten free. Spelt flour, which is called for in the gluten containing recipes, is given it's own page description and even the author warns against using spelt if you are gluten sensitive or celiac. In Chapter 2 none of the recipes are gluten free.     The base flour used in the gluten free recipes is Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Flour Mix. No special tips on mixing your own flours. Just buy the mix. I think most of use on gluten free diets have already tried Bob's mix. It's fine, but from a specialty bakery I'd expect something a little more, well, special.     If I had been in the bookstore browsing this book I would never have bought it. I haven't had the time yet to make any of the recipes that are gluten free, and my enthusiasm has waned.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|This review is for the Director's Cut Blu-ray version of Daredevil which you may have read elsewhere is an improvement over the 103 minute theatrical cut. There is more background to Daredevil's character which really helps the story along, although the movie's script is far from ideal. The dts Master Audio really shines and the video is solid but not quite demo material. For around $15 with free Prime shipping it was too good of a bargain to pass up.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|Some, like my wife, will have a problem (small or large) with the makers of this hot summer release for playing fast and loose with the fabric of the original but I think the majority will love this new and extremely well made blockbuster. It's perfectly cast. Its script is fast and funny and it does a fine job avoiding the lameness that marred many of its predecessors. For me, this is the best ST movie since The Voyage Home and I look forward to another. Maybe they'll even put back what they took apart.<br /><br />Anyway, from Taxi Driver up to Alien III I could always tell by the previews whether a movie was going to be good or bad. I thought Alien III was going to be good. Since then I've been fooled time and time again. This movie is no exception. Its trailer belied it quality. I thought for sure it would be no better than Insurrection or Nemesis but I couldn't have been more wrong. So, as long as you're not a fervent Trekker purist, you will have a great time. For the details, read the excellent review by the Joelmeister (first review posted).<br /><br />Most highly recommended.
B0002KPIQY|3.0|I have to give this an \\"A\\" for the acting...especially Angelina.  As for the movie's story...well...not so much impressed with that.  Thought they used the story to show more \\"skin\\"...so to speak.  Personally thought the story line was hyped..but I have \\"no\\" real insight into this sort of world.    The acting was superb...just didn't care for the story so this didn't get a 5 star in my mind's eye.
032147404X|5.0|I found this book very helpful for someone who has just decided to pick up a camera and start taking pictures. The language is casual and easy to understand. The advice on equipment was practical and much appreciated. If you have much experience with photography you might want something more advanced or technical. I read some people say you should just read the manual and go play, which sounds fun, but I wouldn't recommend doing that. If you want to take really nice photos this book is a nice companion to your manual. It even directs you to areas of your manual to show you how to adjust certain features for different effects. If you are able to read the manual all the way through, good on you, but I think most beginners will find this book helpful. Just try not to get annoyed by the jokes on the first couple of pages, they are bad. Don't let that stop you from getting a lot out of this book.
0930289234|5.0|In an alternate dimension in the year 1985, Richard Nixon is still president of the united states and superheros that have existed have been outlawed since the 70's. A former super soldier named The Comedian was brutally murdered mysteriously as he worked for a superhero group called CrimeBusters as his friends Roschach who is a mysterious avenger with a weird blank mask, Dr. Manhattan a glowing nude radioactive superhero of god-like powers, sexy Silk Spectre and the NightOwl who is wise smart and heroic all join together to solve the mystery of the Comedian's death. They must also find out what is behind an upcoming doomsday project that would lead to world war III or else it's too late.<br /><br />This is the Godfather of all graphic novels! Created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons (who also did the artwork), this is one of the most original and provocative graphic novels of all time. Ever since 1985 when DC Comics disturbuted the comics they became an instant classic, comic fanboys have raved by this novel since it came out yet it still is a memorable masterpiece. The artwork by Dave Gibbons is superb and has a nice complex storyline that borders the story as Sci-fi/mystery/fantasy/action all combined. This definitely ain't kid stuff for it's basically for mature readers due to some violence, language and some sexuality but done in a tasteful kind of manner, Zack Sydner's movie was also awesome but doesn't have the brilliance of this graphic novel for it's a must have for any library.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|The story opens as the Federation Starship Kelvin encounters a lightning storm in space and a tentacled alien ship. Their Captain takes a shuttle craft over to negotiate with Nero (Eric Bana) a Romulan, leaving George Kirk in charge. When the situation gets dire, George Kirk evacuates the ship including his wife who is delivering their child. George Kirk hears his son's cries as he fights to keep his crew alive.    Next, we follow the early life of a very rebellious young James Tiberius Kirk alternating with young half Vulcan-half human Spock. From stealing a classic sportscar and getting caught to engaging in bar fights, we can definitely see what events shaped the Captain's life. Spock's life took a very different tack, as he attempted to abandon his early anger at Vulcan rejection and embrace logic.    Then Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) challenges Jim Kirk to step up just as the Starfleet academy recruits are leaving. He tells Kirk about his father, George: \\"He was Captain for 12 minutes and saved an 800 person crew,\\" and challenges his son to live up to the legend.    We follow Jim Kirk's (played by Chris Pine) career from there, introducing him to the various crew members at key points in the plot. His meeting with \\"Bones\\" McCoy (Karl Urban) is classic! Most of us were cheering at their interactions throughout the film. JJ Abrams and the actors had their humor down pat. We also see what happened with the famed Kobayashi Maru Trial. This is where Kirk meets up with Spock (Zachary Quinto) for the first time and they naturally clash. Then, it's time for their first assignment to a starship--and the eventual run-in with Nero and his Romulan ship.    While the actors are (save for Leonard Nimoy as an older Spock) not the original cast, JJ Abrams did a very credible job finding actors with both strong resemblance and characteristics to the originals. Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) as Engineer Montgomery Scott was a stroke of genius. He played the role with the exact amount of humor and bombast. Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy was also another real winner. At last, we find out what propelled the good doctor off solid ground and into space.    The special effects were excellent. Recalling the original episodes from my elementary school days, I can definitely say they have come a long way from using adapted salt and pepper shakers as communication devices. Battle scenes were so good, I found myself holding my breath.    Both my husband and I gave the film an enthusiastic thumbs up. We're going back to see it again this weekend and are buying the Blu-Ray disk. I genuinely hope that this ST franchise continues. Both my spouse and I agree this is the best of the spinoffs.    Rebecca Kyle, May 2009

0545128285|5.0|I loved this book! I am 25 years old but I've kept up with every book and movie in the Harry Potter series. If you are a Harry Potter fan I recommend this book or even if you've never read a Harry Potter book before! You don't have to be familiar with the history of Harry Potter because J.K Rowling does a great job of explaining where Beedle the Bard came from and you even get a small taste of Harry Potter characters in this book. Great for kids!!
B001U0HBPG|4.0|There are some decent performances here from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, as well as some lovely period design on the sets, and a great soundtrack to boot.  The concept of a man who ages in reverse is a fascinating one.  I only wish that more had been done with the possible implications of it.  The movie doesn't delve very deeply into this aspect.  Also, the entire middle section of the film sags under its own weight. The earlier part, with Benjamin being born as a little old man, and the later part, with him growing back into a child and then a baby, are more interesting.  Quibble:  hummingbirds do not fly during category 5 hurricanes, nor do they fly out to sea, as far as I know.  I'm just saying.  It's worth viewing, but I recommend taking breaks and not trying to watch the whole thing at once, as it does run nearly 3 hours.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Los Angeles, California. Present Day.<br /><br />Max (Jamie Foxx) is one of a thousand cab drivers in the city. He keeps his cab squeaky clean during his night shift, he knows his streets and his signals, and he always reaches his passengers' destinations in time. He's been driving a cab for 12 years, but he's got some big dreams. He wants to own a limo company, and is only comfortable talking about it to those who look like they would never laugh their butts off at him. One of these people is a prosecutor named Annie Farrell (Jada Pinkett Smith). She gives him her card after a drive to the Justice Department, and Max can't decide at the moment if he wants to call her later or not. What comes next is something that is completely unexpected.<br /><br />The next passenger in Max's cab is a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise). He looks to be a business man, with a clean gray suit and a luxurious-looking briefcase. Vincent makes a deal with Max: make five stops for the night and he'll give the driver 600 dollars total. Max hesitates, and slowly accepts the offer. At the first stop, the cab is parked in the alley of an apartment building where the first stop is located. Vincent enters the building, while Max takes his time eating a deli sandwich and examining photos of automobiles, which probably gives him motivation for his \\"big dream\\". With the exception of the radio, everything is silent . . . until a dead body crashes on the top of the taxi. Seeing the broken window on top of the apartment building, and Vincent returning with no look of shock on his face, Max discovers . . .<br /><br />Max: \\"You killed him?!\\"<br />Vincent: \\"No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.\\"<br /><br />Max has become the driver for a hitman who has been contracted to kill five people in one night.<br /><br />\\"Collateral\\" is a movie that focuses on these two men of extreme differences. Vincent is a cold-blooded killer who does what he sets out to do, and if something happens, he decides to \\"improvise\\" and \\"adapt\\" if the change is either unstoppable or too abrupt. Max, on the other hand, does not use improvisation. He plans everything from the start with no distractions, hoping to fulfill his dreams of owning his own limo company that he's puting up. Vincent never loved L.A.; Max is comfortable living in the city. Vincent loves Jazz; Max does not. And so on. These two men find themselves questioning each other's motives and beliefs, which leads to an ultimate confrontation in the end.<br /><br />The city of Los Angeles becomes an important \\"character\\" in the film. The foggy nights, the city lights, the unavoidable crime, the towering skyline, everything looks beautiful. Director Michael Mann has really captured the look and feel of L.A. in an almost perfect way. The digital cinematography makes it all worthwhile.<br /><br />Cruise, Foxx, Pinket Smith, and Ruffalo make a fine acting ensemble. Even though I'm not a big fan of Cruise, I'd say that this is a big surprise. Here he is not seen as a hero, but a villain. He is a cold-blooded contract killer who knows how to properly use a gun. But the truth is, you don't know if you should love or hate Vincent. Aside from the story of his parents, we don't know much about his past, and what drove him to this path. I could say that he does have a heart, but his job is what shatters that statement. Foxx manages to play the part of the average guy very well. He finds himself in a hazardous situation, and he doesn't know what will happen to him when it's over. He should've won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but his win for \\"Ray\\" clearly makes up for it. Pinkett Smith's role is smaller in the film, but it is influential in that she becomes part of Vincent's questioning of Max's life. She is a fine actress, and she never misses a beat here. Ruffalo may be a bit off at times, but he is still believable as the Detective who starts to see that the killings may be linked to something more serious. I never realized it was Javier Bardem who played Felix until I saw \\"No Country for Old Men.\\" He looks and sounds creepy here, but not as creepy as Chigurh.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies in general. The atmosphere of Los Angeles, the acting of Cruise and Foxx, and the music (kudos to Audioslave, Paul Oakenfold, and James Newton Howard) are just few of the reasons for the admiration. This is yet another film (along with The Godfather 1 & 2, No Country for Old Men, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.) that I'll never get tired of watching repeatedly.<br /><br />Grade: ACountry for Old Men.\\" He looks and sounds creepy here, but not as creepy as Chigurh.

0061537934|4.0|Wow--what an unusual and original book.  I highly recommend this one.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away.  The story is told by Enzo--a dog, and he is very sensitive and wonderful--probably one of the most memorable characters I've encountered in a long while.  He is an intelligent and caring soul, trapped in the body of a dog.  Just read it.<br /><br />This book should appeal to just about anyone, male or female.  It is a quick read.<br /><br />4 stars

1400064287|5.0|I've read many management books that go into dry concepts, or simplistic ideas that everyone should know (make priority lists), but this book was really inspirational.

B0024F08RO|5.0|Sure, season 4 didn't always follow the rules of logic but since when do we expext that rollercoaster-high-octane entertainment should live up to intense scientific scrutiny?  Prison Break 4 has been one of the most exciting, thrilling and shout-out-loud-in-front-of-your-telly series that I have ever seen. Add to that the fact that season 4 also brought us one of the coolest characters living through an intense emotional storyline (I am off course talking about Mr. Alexander Mahone) played by an actor who performs so intense it makes you gasp for breath...and you have perfect television. I have loved watching 4 years of PB, it's been a great ride!
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Madonna's elventh album was a hot mess it was ok, but we all know that Madonna can do better. It seems she was trying to be young again. this album was a big departure from the formula that made Confessions on a Dancefloor such an great ablum. Ok, let edit this review shall in retrospect this album has actually grown on me. But what I said before I still believe but its still an enjoyable record, one the sounds incredibly dated. The tracks that Pharrell produced sounds like older Neptunes songs and should be avoided, Timbaland does fair better and 4 Minutes is still a hot track. This album shines it more downtempo moments with Voices and the Devil Wouldn't Recognize You. The More upbeat tracks that I would recommend are Dance 2nite and Beat Goes On.

0439023483|5.0|The phone rang.<br /><br />\\"Are you ill?\\" my friend asked me with alarm.  \\"You don't sound well.\\"<br /><br />\\"Just sitting here with tears streaming down my face,\\" I assured her,  \\"finishing one of the best books I ever read.\\"<br /><br />In fact, the only book I've ever read that got me out of bed in the middle of the night to read the next chapter.  Haunting, unforgettable, an amazing tale about the resourcefulness and resiliency of the human spirit, with twists and turns through the meaning of courage, integrity, and the complexity of love.<br /><br />Book 2's debut this coming September seems a long time to wait.  Hurry up and order Book 1, however, so you have time to ponder this one awhile before the sequel arrives.  Also you'll have time to let your teen take a crack at it too.
B000AMUU94|5.0|Artist Dimthingshineon recently did a cover of David Bowie songs: \\"She Shook Me Cold\\", \\"All The Young Dudes\\", and \\"Something In The Air\\" on his latest 4 CD project called \\"Nostalgia\\" released in 2009. Check out  [...]   or [...]
B000ELJBAA|2.0|This was supposed to be a re-mastered version of this cd, but to be honest after listening to it I couldn't tell the difference from the original release. I love this album despite some of the negativity I've read from Floyd fans, but this purchase was a disappointment for me. I recommend this cd for novice Floyd fans, but if you already have the original 1984 release, don't waste your money trying to upgrade to the re-master.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Let me start by saying: 1) I've never watched The Biggest Loser; 2) I've never been overweight; and 3) I'm in great shape, a gym and workout addict who definitely never \\"phones it in.\\" Before I got pregnant last year, I was hooked on long, hard workouts -- kill-myself cardio and serious weights. I kept in good shape throughout my pregnancy, too, with regular 45 minute sessions on the arc-trainer, and as much strength training as I could handle. But after my daughter was born, I suddenly found that I didn't have time to get to the gym any more -- much less for 2 hours like I used to do! (Who would've guessed?) 3-1/2 months later, I can still pound out a good 5 mile run when my husband hangs with baby on the weekends, but I'm not able to get my every day fix...and I've still got 15 pounds of baby weight to lose.    I didn't think it was possible for a 20-minute workout to challenge me, but this one DOES. I was able to do everything on Level 1 with no serious problems, and felt exhilarated (and sweaty) afterwards...and I was SHOCKED by how sore I was the day after -- every muscle hurt, in a good way. After 2 days of Level 1, I tried Level 2, and found myself grunting with exertion and swearing at the screen.    Make no mistake -- this is a tough workout. It's not FUN, or FANCY. The moves are very basic, they're just HARD. After trying a bunch of workout videos filled with fluffy, impossible-to-follow \\"dance moves\\" that barely get my heart rate up, this is just what I need. Planning on buying all the other Jillian videos immediately!
B000002KK2|5.0|This is one of the best under rated of all times she was ahead of her time alot of young artist took on her format like Nora Jones every song on this C.D is good I Love this C.D.
B0001VQJDA|5.0|These replaced an older version of these binoculars. The new ones are much lighter and the view seems to be brighter. While I do wish the IS button would toggle, it really is not much of an issue. However for the price it would be nice if Canon would include a hard case and some type of protection for the eyepeices, I wear glasses and with the rubber eye cups folded down the eyepeice lenses are very exposed. Overall I give these binoculars 5 stars.
0307450570|4.0|This book is great, but doesn't cover as much as I thought it would. It is great for any adult or teen who wants to do crafts, and is tired of searching the internet only to come up with tons of crafts that are meant for small children.    As always, Martha presents the info. very clearly and concisely, and a great bonus is that there are detailed pictures for every project.     I would recommend this book to anyone who likes polished crafts or who is looking to perk up their home decorating for cheap!
0375507256|4.0|I admit, I wasn't sure how I would like this book at first, but ended up thinking it was pretty fantastic. I got bogged down on one section later in the first half (saying it just didn't hold my interest at all would be an understatement), but in the end I got through it and loved the rest of it. The writing and language is wonderful, and very evocative, and at the end of the book, I found that I really took the time to think back over it rather than just moving on to the next book as I often do.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|Blue ray edition excellent.  I am sure that it would really be noticed using a larger than 50 inch display
0374531269|4.0|This book was heart-wrenching and enlightening at the same time. A very moving look at a very bad childhood, from Ishmael's escape from the rebels, to his stint in the government army of Sierra Leone, to the transition back to normality. My one quibble, and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is that it ended very abruptly, and I kept looking for the pages my copy of the book was clearly missing. But for the most part, I found myself grateful for my own life and that Beah would share his story, the horrific stories of the war mingling with the beautiful memories of his young childhood with his family.
1416914307|5.0|To reawaken her mother, Clary must seek out a certain warlock in Idris, the land of the Shadowhunters, because only he can concoct the potion to counter the draught Jocelyn has taken and save her. But Jace is completely set against Clary's entrance into Alicante, the City of Glass, and will do anything to thwart her plans to get there, keeping faith that the illegality of entrance without permissions will curtail Clary's willful desire to travel there. But Clary, harnessing her newly found powers, defies the Law for the sake of love only to find herself in a worsening situation in the most beautiful and unforgettable city, Alicante: tensions between traditionally thinking and more modern Shadowhunters arise, her best from Simon has been imprisoned for his unusual vampiric qualities, and Valentine's ever present threat keeps everyone on edge. Limits of endurance will be met and surpassed, truth will be horribly twisted with lie, and unexpected foes and allies will alter this epic struggle. But who will triumph, pure love or pure evil?    In City of Glass, Clare ends her unforgettable Mortal Instruments trilogy with an epic resounding boom. It is so difficult for authors to create such original continuations of an already amazing story without becoming boring and repetitive, and so I must commend Clare for her exquisite work in City of Glass. As in the first two installments of this trilogy, City of Bones and City of Ashes, the story in City of Glass is completely attention consuming and extremely difficult to put down. The plot is just so suspenseful and interesting with totally unpredictable twists and turns, and the reader will want to remember every exciting detail. The characters as well are realistic; I've come to know and love Clary, Jace, and Simon, among others, and was glad that they stayed true to themselves. I was also delighted with the several new characters because Clare still manages to familiarize the reader with these new people through just glimpsesof their lives. Lastly, I would just like to remark that even though the Mortal Instruments trilogy's primary greatness comes from the dangerous and alluring world within it, these novels also show what it's like to be human and the never ending struggle between good and evil: no one is born innately one or the other, but it is our choices in life that define us as more of one over the other.    City of Glass is a satisfying end on a perfect note to an incredible trilogy. Fans of the first two, City of Bones and City of Ashes, will quickly devour this one, and those who have finished reading the trilogy won't be able to wait for the upcoming prequel trilogy, The Infernal Devices. Readers who love the Mortal Instruments trilogy may also like The Abhorsen Chronicles by Garth Nix, Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, Tithe by Holly Black, Wicked Lovely by Melissa Marr, and The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien.
0060531053|3.0|I am new to home brewing, and while I found this book useful and fun, I found the book, \\"How to Brew\\" by John Palmer, much more helpful. Make no mistake, it belongs in your collection if you are a brewer, but if you are new to it all, I definitely recommend, John Palmer's book.
0446402397|5.0|I agree with most of the other reviews.  As a big fan of Martin Cruz Smith, I was totally absorbed by Tom Rob's similar approach to Russian fiction.  Atmospheric with well thought-out characters wrapped up in a compelling mystery.  Yes, the final 100 pages were weak, but I still assign it 5 stars.  Well done Tom Rob- I hope your follow up is on a par with Child 44.  The last time I had high hopes for a follow up was after Alan Folsom's Day after tomorrow- a stellar debut- but what a clunker he came up with in Day of confession.  Let's hope Mr. Smith really is the real deal.
0937381888|5.0|I am very glad I got this book before I read, Complete Joy of Homebrewing...even though I have both I think this book is a must have for beginners. The walk through is a lot more precise and it just seems to be more current as well. Highest recommend!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Jamal's journey would be a better title for this film, which is interesting but by no means perfect or Best Picture material except insofar as I think it touched liberal hearts as to the plight of the poor in Bombay-so they will hand out gold statuettes and forget all about them.      Jamal goes from child to man, and still manages to remain pure and idealistic, despite all of the temptations.    When he is being tortured (interrogated) and asked 'What does a slumdog know', he said, the answers. It is more like, he knows the value of love and clings to it, even in the slums. From the episode in the crapper, where he will do anything to earn a living, and also get the autograph of his favorite Bollywood star, to the way his mother sacrifices herself, to the way he repays the little girl for helping them by making her a third 'Musketeer', he holds on to love no matter what.    By contrast we have Salim, his brother, only out for himself, and selfdestructive with it. He is the true slumdog, not willing to work an honest job, acting as a pimp to the poor girl Jamal tries to rescue because he has always loved her, and so full of hate he kills without compunction.  Only at the end does he show he is able to love but by then it is too late.    This film has layers like an onion and some great performances by young actors, but it is not jolly happy viewing, with rape, torture, maiming, and every other crime and inhumanity to man you can think of. It is also a predictable ending, a kind of modern morality play, so while it is a compelling narrative, and I would recommend it, I do have my reservations as above.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana Krall may well be the First Lady of jazz these days, both for her extraordinary piano playing and for a voice that seems almost accidentally beautiful.  Then there's her face! A high degree of taste coupled with a sincere humility about the inspiration of her idols makes her the epitome of the growing artist in line with those who came long before her.  She also shows the resilience of the American Song Book, and here she works herself into the bossa nova music that has served so many artists so well for so long.  The arrangements are superb, her piano playing impeccable, and those who would criticize her for \\"returning\\" to the lush sound of ten years ago should realize that a style is something one evolves, not something merely to fall back on. Her combo is, as ever, sensitive to her every nuance.
B00009L1TA|5.0|the movie is a must see...I would have liked to know in advance what regional code it was in.
B00280LYHS|5.0|this book pretty much rocked ! it was a lot more intense than the other books. intense action, and even a little love tiangles going on. it sums up the series pretty well and answers all the questions and stuff. you also learn a lot about luke's and nico's families. my only tiny complaint is that it could have described the planning of the battles a little more.(there are lots of battle sequences!) but all in all it was amzingly awesome!
B00008EYA5|5.0|Seen it at the movies and on television....finally own it on dvd.  Like the dvd better.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I clearly remembered when this album was released.  I bought it the day of its release and listened to it over and over again.  For some reason, I eventually shelved it.  But I recently pulled it back out.  The test for a great album is whether it stands up after a decade. I must say I actually believe this cd is even better now.  Its a real tragedy that u2 took to heart the criticsm they recieved after the release of this album and the subsequent tour.  In the 2000's, they have become a band afraid to take risks and really \\"f#@$ up the mainstream\\".    \\"POP\\" is an album addressing the stench of consumerism and fame and at the same time celebrating it.  The lyrics find Bono desperately searching for salvation, sometimes in very dark places while in the music, you can almost see neon lights flickering on a sleazy street corner. In \\"Mofo\\", Bono screams for love, acceptance, and emotional embrace from his deceased mother.  It may be the most gut wrenchingly personal song he ever wrote.  The anger you hear in the techno pop drive of the song is almost unnerving.    Other glimpses into Bono's inner pysche are revealed.  In \\"Gone\\", he reveals the weariness associated with being an icon.  He almost sounds like he wishes it would all go away.  Had they not released another album, it wouldnt have been surprising after hearing this song.    Even anger at God is heard.  \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" sounds at first like a pleasant song.  But the message of the song is that we are so screwed up, even God cant help us.  According to \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\", perhaps God is too preoccupied to help us.  This isnt sacreligous; even David himself wrote of this kind of anger in Psalms.      \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" is really almost a joke.  The subject of the song dismays at the world around him and pines for some type of paradise. The song seems to have a gospel feel and if one hadnt seen the title, the gates of the mansion could be mistaken for heaven.  But then the singer reveals at the endhe believes paradise is found at Hugh's house.  Its really a metaphor for our misplaced conception of what paradise and salvation really is.    Its too bad that since the release of this horribly underrated album that u2 hasnt come close to this type of artistic risk again.  They tried to recapture the sonic and thematic sense this album has when they wrote and recorded \\"No Line on the Horizon\\".  While \\"No Line\\" has its moments and is more risky than their other releases of the 2000's, \\"Pop\\" is U2's last great record.
B000QGEB12|5.0|Great Movie. Arrived on time and was in perfect condition. This is a classic for the collection. My wife ,who is chinese,says that the dialoge is slightly different on the version than the one we saw earlier. I don't know if it was edited for the version or not. But this was a great buy.
B000000OF6|4.0|This set has all the Queen music you want.  Great value for the price.
0930289234|5.0|The novel's scenario is an alternate world where much of our present fears coexist along with some sort of picture of our mind's state around simple questions as \\"where do i come from?\\", \\"do we need to be protected from ourselves no matter the cost?\\", and many more. The characters deal with concerning revelations about the future being endangered by humans's stupid pursue of self-indulgence and comfort at any cost, and discover themselves humane. Yuo will experience mixed emotions and a strong tought-provoking plot. Are we so different from people from that fictional world?
0975991477|5.0|This book rocks!  I greatly enjoyed it and the information was wonderful!  Thanks again!
0446615625|4.0|David Baldacci's Camel Club introduces us to the quirky fun characters that give the book its title. The fact that the \\"club\\" lives on through 3 subsequent books illustrates that this is a winning formula.  The Camel Club is a group of eccentric middle aged men who enjoy meeting and investigating conspiracy theories.  They happen upon a murder and are quickly thrown into the middle of the biggest conspiracy theory of them all.<br /><br />The author introduces a lot of characters to the mix, but he does a good job of bringing everyone together for the finale.  My only complaint about the book is that much of the dialogue between the club members sounds like something out of Scooby-Doo.  At the end, I was expecting someone like Velma to pull off the bad guy's mask.  However, don't let that discourage you from reading this fine novel.
B001RTP48G|5.0|Got the album today on special order at my local HMV in Montreal, after discovering the domestic instore release of it in Quebec & probably most of Canada too, has been delayed twice. No word as to when the stores will actually have it. My CD is the glossy black limited edition digipak, which was made in Holland.<br /><br />The album is beautiful, sexy and is exactly what I was expecting. \\"Release\\" and \\"Fundamental\\" didn't work well with my likes, although, at times, there were some good moments. Where have these guys been? I'm glad they're back with a new album instead of remixing & re-releasing old stuff. Am I right?<br /><br />The fresh new sound, mixed with many remnants of their fabulous orchestral arrangements, sexy, sweeping & rolling sound...is presented in a brilliant double album. What a treat! \\"Yes, etc\\" is definitely NOT a waste of money. Neil's voice is crystal clear and he sounds good as ever.<br />Chris Lowe's keyboard & programming is and always be outstanding. This album is definitely an Essential gem & addition to your PSB collection, hands down. Glad to know Johnny Marr is back with them, on guitars. Goes to show how excellent work can be created when collaborating with the right minds.<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent and the Xenomania remixes are perfect. I'm familiar with some of Xenomania's work when they remixed Sarah Brightman's \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\". Of course, since then, his remixing has progressed, and it's a real treat to see how well PSB's sexy sound has been integrated into his remixing brilliance.<br /><br />As for the packaging....well, the discs are subject to scratches & wear, for there aren't any sleeves to put them in prior to sliding 'em in and out of the digipak. So, just be careful & find some way of protecting them without marking the playing surfaces beyond playability. With that said, I still think this special edition digipak is much more attractive than the standard 1-disc, white jewel-case version. Regardless which edition you get, buy the album and you'll enjoy it without a doubt.m and you'll enjoy it without a doubt.
B001NLKXK2|2.0|I wanted this story to delve deeply into the characters' skin, to find out how each person felt about how this disease was affecting their lives.  What I got was a paint-by-numbers disease-of-the-week Lifetime Movie script.   The changing dynamic of Alice and John's relationship could have been explored in much more detail, and would have made for a compelling story, but that story line (like all the others), was very surface-level.    Given that the author has a scientific background in Alzheimer's, and is not primarily a writer, I'm really not surprised at the lack of depth, but still disappointed how predictable it was.
B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|Where to start?<br /><br />1. I was 7-9 years old when the Original Series was on television.  I was hooked.<br /><br />2. I was 20 when the \\"Star Trek\\" (the movies) were in the theatres.  I was hooked. (Loved \\"The Movie\\", 2, 4!  3, 5, 6 were okay...)<br /><br />3. I was 28 when Star Trek (The Next Generation) was on television.  I was hooked.<br /><br />4. At 50, I've been treated to a new release.  Not bad!  Different!  But not bad, at all!<br /><br />For those of you, who, like me grew up with the series, keep an open mind (difficult for Trekkies, I know!), just go with this picture and enjoy it for what it is, and let it stand on it's own merits!  I think you'll like it!  My rating: 4 stars!
B00007KLJJ|4.0|Four Feathers was overlooked in the theatres, but for fans of Heath Ledger, it's a must see. It shows his versatility, and the story is interesting and intriguing.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Excellent series !!
B000NJVWU0|5.0|EVE is a highly misunderstood Alan Parsons Project CD. At first, after I had a number of bad experiences with women, including a day program instructor who bunked out on my YMCA trip to observe a religious occasion and a rec group staffer who got on my case for talking about one subject nonstop, I though that this album was a much-needed attempt to put these people and others like them in their place. However, I now realize that the album is actually about the effect women have on men in general, especially women like Maxine Aston, a psychologist who claims that long-term exposure to autism-spectrum individuals can lead to symptoms ranging from stress-related acne to suicidal depression, and isn't attacking anyone I know, as I'm now going to be making over $200 per month working for a female boss. I also feel that, as uncomfortable as the album's lyrics may seem, it really needs to be evaluated on its musical merits, as Andrew Powell did some incredible orchestrations, which the warm, thick remastering only makes more obvious. Finally, the album does give a female perspective as well as a male one, which mitigates the somewhat nasty tone of some of the lyrics.
B0013NAP2G|4.0|From a concert standpoint, it isn't Mariah's best but she still puts on a good show. The voice isn't quite what it was years ago but she can still outsing a lot of these so-called pop stars these days!    She sings many of her best hits from \\"Its Like That\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Dreamlover\\" and \\"Butterfly.\\" She even gets together with members of Boyz II Men for \\"One Sweet Day.\\" Overall, a good (not great) concert. Short of 5 stars but is a 3 1/2 star concert (had to give her 4 since the star system doesn't allow half-stars).    As a man personally though, I'll admit that Mariah isn't in the shape she used to be but what's up with all these \\"fat\\" comments! Quite frankly, for almost 40, she looks great! She isn't toned like she used to be (and to me if you are going to wear those kinds of outfits, you should be) but come on! She's hardly \\"fat.\\"    Anyway, back to this concert. It's worth a look but I'd find it cheaper than what it is being sold for.
B000NJVWUA|5.0|AMMONIA AVENUE, the last Top 20 album by the Alan Parsons Project, is an album about the breakdown of communication between people. It's a theme with which I'm quite familiar myself, as I've been hindered by lack of communication among staff, as well as between staff and those served, at various agencies I've been with. At times, this state of affairs has kept things that would help me look good for young women I had crushes on from coming together. This CD could also be seen as a protest against such things as pseudo-scientific research claiming that long-term relationships with people on the autism spectrum can cause symptoms both physical and mental, ranging from simple adult-onset acne to suicidal depression. It could also be seen as an indictment of how people see name-calling as fun and games, and how people with high-functioning autism and people who are very smart are often misunderstood and not respected. If you've ever been through any of these things, this is a CD you must own, especially with its warm, thick remastering.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I am 25 years old and I like to listen to call kinds of music, nothing is off limits. I'm mad my parents and others never made me listen to this album! Pretty much every song on this album has been sampled. Imagine my shame to discover Coolio did not write the hook for Gangsta's Paradise (Pastime paradise)among others. Thanks a lot guys! I could've been listening to awesome and classicly modern music ages ago!
B001AVEJ1Y|3.0|First, the movie was entertaining and fast-paced -- mindless fun really since the movie made no real sense (let's just throw in a Black Hole, a Giant Drill, and Red Matter to make it Sci-Fi).  However, it makes no sense unless you take it forward as a new crew to explore under conditions of an alternate reality...    Since Spock from the future is in the present of the \\"original ENTERPRISE crew\\" (which, by the way, Chekov was NOT a part of) as they make headway in their first film, this is just Star Trek taking off on new adventures in another alternate universe where Vulcan is destroyed, Spock's mother is dead, Kirk's father is deceased (and he is promoted to to Captain before he ever graduates the academy), Spock and Uhura are lovers, the ship is more technically advanced than the Enterprise D, and more importantly Scotty is a renegade with a new cute sidekick!    ARE YOU KIDDING ME?    Even if you take into account that history was changed by the Romulans going back in time, It doesn't account for all of the changes. The franchise has been changed to appeal to teenagers while betraying 40 years of dedicated fans.     Since Spock exists and has disrupted time, the adventures that we know of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc., can NEVER and WILL NEVER exist due to all historical events being changed.  Great move to move the franchise forward with new movies, but it destroys the concept of the Crew of the Enterprise that we know and love, since they are in a past alternate universe that has now been destroyed.      So, to heck with all with know about Star Trek.  May the older Spock live and mentor the new Spock, who will father Uhura's Love-Child, which will infuriate Nurse Chapel who may go on a jealous rampage and may very well not decide to mother Deanna Troi (this is a joke, but why not, and for good measure let's add Data to the next movie while the iron is hot!).    C'mon.  This movie could have been really fun if it focused on true origins and not some cockamamie alternate time story that will now lead the future of the franchise.    Be thankful you were not involved Bill Shatner, as the REAL Captain Kirk did die on a planet fighting Malcolm McDowell with Captain Picard.  Btw, the real Kirk got knocked down, but he never lost fights!  This Kirk got his butt kicked over and over again.  It really is not your Father's Kirk (or in my case, MY Kirk).    Just Sad. Perhaps the solution would have been to resurrect the original Animated Series and present the crew in a full-length story in that movie medium instead of what I sat through just about an hour ago?

0374139563|4.0|Dambisa Moyo is not the first to make the argument that the direct-to-government model of foreign aid has been a dismal failure over the last 50 years. She is one of the first African women that has done so in a highly visible way. The former Goldman-Sachs economist has taken a bit of heat for her willingness to question whether the Bob Geldof's and Bono's of the world, while well-intentioned, have helped to perpetuate a sense that Africa is a basket case and is (and will continue to be) a charity case that relies on the willingness and compassion of the developed world. Moyo asserts that Africa is capable of economic development only after the aid that has lined the pockets of dozens of despots, is cut off. She does make exception for NGO's and emergency relief, but believes that Africa's future lies in its ability to raise capital investment and function in a competitive market.

0441009425|5.0|I never thought I'd ever see really good hard SF again, and here comes Alastair Reynolds (a real working rocket scientist) to blow my little brain cells out of their computerized rut.  What all the other 4- and 5-star reviewers said.  Also IMO his prolific use of female protagonists is both refreshing and totally apt for the 21st century.  His women are smart and proactive, in fact one might say they have all the best parts.  His aliens are appropriately mysterious, so hard to understand and communicate with they're nearly invisible -- not humans with forehead bumps or pointy ears.  Also, his worlds are worlds, with different ecosystems on different parts of the planet.  Chase scene?  Count 'em: 99.9% of all SF has chase scenes.  He's got 3 ships chasing each other in and out of a gas giant atmosphere (not in Revelation Space, and no, I'm not going to spoil by telling you which one).  May Alastair have a long, long, very long life with plenty of time to write more of this excellent SF!
0316010669|1.0|I didn't finish blink, made it two-thirds of the way through. The whole premise is stupid to me, and the most bothersome part is that while the author tosses around buzz terms like thin slicing and this so-called built in ability to laser through the troublesome act of actually reflecting on a comprehensive picture, he never really touches on the fact that 9 out of 10 of his examples are the result of expert ability based on 20+ years of dedication to the respective discipline, or riding on the shoulders of the equally applied efforts of someone else. And what really bothers me is how many people flock to this *&% as this wonderful new way of thinking. I made it as far as I did because the anecdotes are entertaining, but c'mon gimme a break, and jeesh.

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|After \\"Halloween\\" became the biggest independent thriller of all-time in 1978, producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill set out to see if lightning could strike twice with \\"The Fog\\". Hitting theatres in 1979, the film wasn't as big a hit as its predecessor, but nevertheless \\"The Fog\\" has lived on as being one of the scariest films of the 1970's. \\"The Fog\\" is about a seaside town called Antonio Bay that is blanketed by a huge fogbank one cool summer night. People are murdered and all hell breaks loose as this small coastal town tries to survive the evil that lurks around them. Jamie Lee Curtis, who starred in \\"Halloween\\", also stars in this blockbuster, along with her mother, one of the screen's greatest stars Janet Leigh. Adrienne Barbeau, who became a TV star in \\"Maude\\", also stars as a disc jockey working in a lighthouse who witnesses the fog descending on the town and its inhabitants. The film is really scary, not in the sense that its filled with a lot of gore, but in the fact that not knowing what is in the fog makes things that more terrifying.<br /> This DVD contains a ton of bonuses, including a documentary on the film with its stars, outtakes, audio commentary by the producers, and much more.<br /> \\"Newsweek\\" calls the film \\"crisply chilling\\" and \\"The Film Journal\\" says, \\"The Fog\\" is \\"a tale of nocturnal terror\\".<br /> Columbia released a remake of \\"The Fog\\" in 2006, and it is a great film worth of owning.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|This was a fitting way to finish the trifecta of action-packed, dry humored, British comedy films that Guy Ritchie put forth.  If you enjoyed Lock, Stock, and two smoking barrels, as well as Snatch, this movie is for you.  I'm interested in the sequel to this, if any.  Don't miss out on this instant classic.
B000W1V5OC|4.0|This is a fantastic, wonderful concert as others have mentioned. I won't spend a lot of time on that except to agree with most of the comments about the performance. Never having had the chance to see Tarja perform, it was great to be able to watch this.    That said, I was quite disappointed by this DVD technically. I can't believe that, given the year and what this is, the \\"end of an era\\" document that this represents, that more care was not taken to have this DVD meet a better standard. 1) The DVD is letterboxed and not anamorphic (if you have a widescreen TV, it still shows as letterboxed instead of filling the screen - that means quality is lost), and 2) the sound is available in only Dolby Digital, not a higher quality version. I can't help but contrast this to Within Temptation's \\"Black Symphony\\" DVD which I bought simultaneous to this - it has a beautifully shot widescreen presentation, and DTS 96/24 sound which on a quality audio system is much better than Dolby Digital. I haven't seen any comments about this for End Of An Era so wanted to mention it. I really wish a better effort had been made technically for this otherwise wonderful document of a special event.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is a great book for thos times when you want to enjoy a purely recreational reading experience. It's very fun and enjoyable, but ultimately lacks depth and creativity.<br /><br />Someone, suggested that this book is a plagarization, but I tend to disagree. While, a great deal of the plot has been borrowed from several popular sources the same is also true of much of the current scifi/fantasy genre.<br /><br />If you like twilight then you'll probably will like this one as well.<br />I like the characters in this one, much better than in the Twilight series.  The protagonist, even though a bit of a Mary Sue is more confident than Bella and much less of a pushover, while the love interest has more personality than Edward. However Stephanie Meyers writing style is a bit richer than Cassandra's, except for Breaking Dawn, which was just awful beyond words. However, I like that Cassandra doesn't get as sickly sweet with her romance and love prose as Stephanie did in Twilight.<br /><br />However, you won't find anything original or thought provoking in this novel. It's all pretty much been done and the writing style is light and airy, rather than deep and complex. Ultimately this is a series to read, just for the fun of it.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|There are already lots of great reviews here for Advent Children, so let me add my review for the half-hour OVA \\"Last Order,\\" which is bundled in as an extra in this release and makes it more than worth buying:    Let me start by saying this OVA... was perfect. Tetsuya Nomura has proved himself fifty times over as a fantastic director with this brief, poignant, and unbelievably powerful little 30-minute OVA. No overt sappiness, no slow-motion tears flying about, none of that. Cloud doesn't even comprehend what has happened. Nothing but grim reality with its edge of grittiness--and it is utterly devastating. I'm sitting here typing in tears and I think, even if I hadn't had the special fascination for this obscure, long-dead side character that I have had since playing FFVII, I still would have been moved to tears by this OVA's plaintive look at the last few hours of this man's life.    It would have been so much easier for Zack to escape on his own; slowed down and strength sapped from carrying the nearly comatose Cloud, Zack could have traveled so much faster and less-conspicuously if he'd just abandoned him. With his strength and wits, he would have made it. It's a mark of what a wonderful person he is that he went so far as to shield Cloud with his own body---Cloud, this random, low-ranking soldier who was probably only an acquaintance before the Nibelheim incident, if at all (SOLDIER first class, the highest of the high, and Cloud, a common, faceless foot soldier!). He didn't owe him a thing, but he still valued this poor kid's life enough to protect him all the way to the end. That's why I'm so happy we have this OVA touching on the truly tragic and unfair fate dealt to such a wonderful person. Zack is such a minor character in the grand scheme of the original game (he's even dead long before it begins!), but still---if you're watching closely---you see, little by little, how much his deeds have effected the story.    He starts out just as shock factor--you seethe photo taken at Nibelheim the day Tifa led Sephiroth's party up to the Mako Reactor, and instead of our familiar, blonde-haired Cloud standing there as we expect, it is a taller, dark-haired stranger. From here, little by little, Zack's influence grows and discover slowly, rather painfully since you know of his sad fate, what sort of person it was who lost his life (and even identity) so that Cloud could take it. You discover that he was the wonderful boyfriend of Aerith's whom Cloud reminded her of, that he was the elite SOLDIER 1st class who was friendly even with the foot soldiers, that he went on his own to try to stop Sephiroth during the Nibelheim massacre, that he suffered side by side with Cloud in Hojo's laboratory for those five, long years of their imprisonment, and it was he, alone, who managed to break free and literally CARRIED Cloud back across two continents and was finally killed defending him when he fought alone against an entire squadron of Shinra soldiers. It hurts, doesn't it? And he did all that never knowing that his actions would give Cloud the strength, motivation, and will to save the world someday.     That's why I love this OVA so much. Just like the cool, unassuming guy that Zack was, it doesn't come at you with this, \\"look at me, this is such a tragedy!!!\\" sort of \\"tragic epic\\" attitude. It's just \\"there was this cool guy, and this is what he did. He fought simply for a chance to live in freely, and died trying.\\" It's just the way Zack would've wanted it, I think.    Directiorally, it was very nice how the movie begins with Cloud (as we expect, Cloud being our cherished hero of FFVII). But all we see is his clouded, green, mako-tinged vision, and all we hear is his gasping breath. He doesn't actually speak a coherent line until much later in the story. In this way, we make the transition from Cloud, who IS FFVII, to Zack, who is (just as in the original game) our \\"hidden\\" hero. You realize long after the fact that Zack is the one we're actually focusing on (every time he enters a scene, it's in a rather unassuming way--the opening, and in the Nibelheim flashback, when he wanders in from the background in the midst of the disaster). All the things you wanted to see most happen--from some of the most AMAZING animated fight scenes I have ever seen (when Sephiroth elegantly slashed away Zack's sword strike, did your heart stop for a moment? Mine did...), to that beautiful moment when Tifa discovered that Cloud did keep his promise (though she later thinks she just hallucinated it... ^^; ), to the perfection that is animated Sephiroth whispering \\"Mother, come with me,\\" to Cloud's truly incredible moment in the fight against Sephiroth. Wow, the power of this animation! (I love you, Mad House!!!!!) And let's not forget that quiet, last scene. Our esteem and affection for Zack is just growing and growing as he cheerfully (and somehow, fatalistically) expounds on the fortunes and adventures he'll have hereafter and then, his famous and haunting line, \\"We're friends, right?\\" to the man who will steal his entire life and identity later on... wow.     Ah, the Turks. Now that was a truly clever touch! I love how they become a sort of sympathetic third party. Tseng's quiet sadness and contemplation of the pitiful fate that Zack and Cloud were dealt, even as he hunts them down, gives the audience solace. We know (as the Turks know) that their escape is futile, but the fact that the people who are actually tracking them down feel sorry for them as well is somehow soothing for us. I love how Tseng's sympathy, and his order to try to take them alive, gave me this wild, completely irrational hope that maybe--just maybe--they would make it through this impossible situation alive. In particular, that last scene when the Turks' helicopter is right there, rushing toward the scene and offering some sort of salvation (at least for their lives) for Zack and Cloud just at their fateful hour. But of course, they don't make it in time. History has already laid down its cold order, hasn't it? And anyway, Zack says it all in that one line--\\"I don't want assurances that my life will be spared. All I want is FREEDOM!\\" I guess for him, it was better to have died fighting of his own will than to return to Hojo's lab of horrors to live as a test subject to the end of his days, ne? But still... ;__;    I love that we see the last moments of Zack's life back in Cloud's point of view. It is satisfying to know that, whatever he forgets or blocks out of his memory later on, he did bear witness to Zack's final sacrifice for him. But that grieving is for later. For now, I love that Cloud has no reaction, no sappy screaming, etc. Just silence and the haunting echo of the gunshot that ends it all. That shot is so devastating, so inevitable... just as we know from the moment we began watching this OVA that Zack would soon die despite all his efforts, that shot is so inevitable and heavy, and we (like Cloud) are so helpless to stop it. We don't even get to see it happen--just the sound signalling that it has been done somewhere beyond our reach and we are only hearing the declaration of its completion after the fact. It's wonderful and SO painful.     Really, truly, hats off to Nomura-sensei and his entire crew. This OVA was everything I had hoped for. Thank you so much for it and for this incredibly well-deserved tribute to that nameless soldier who gave Cloud his life, his sword, and even his memories--and gave us one of the most memorable video game stories of all time.
B001GCUO1G|3.0|Didn't have big expectation for the X-men spin off at all. Don't take me wrongly, I love X-men but the thing is most of the time prequels and spin offs really came together badly. So when I heard that Fox is cashing in on Wolvie with Hugh Jackman, my heart sank and tanked.<br /><br />The movie told us where Wolverine came from and how things led up to the first X-men movie. It is a pretty big parameter to deal with. The movie did come along nicely - nicely means no major disappointment. If you love Wolverine and Hugh, you will be able to sit through the two hours without a problem. The major issue with the movie is the story of Wolverine in the comics was so rich and yet the movie story itself was so thin. The back-story changed here and there and was sprinkled with lots of actions. There is no problem with the actions because Wolverine is all about actions, but then the story failed to back it up with a strong line.  Major scripting flaws included if Wolverine could track down Sabertooth miles away with his super senses, how could he not sense the existence of his girlfriend when he first arrived the lab? That is something beyond comprehension. Also how could he not sense the presence of Zero just up the hill too?<br /><br />In order to tell the audience that it is an X-men movie, there are other few well recognised icons in the movie - Scott Summers (aka Cyclops), Gambit, Blob, Deadpool are all in there. But then because it is a Wolverine movie, they are more like cameos,  and not even supporting characters, which is a pity cos some of them have so much potential. The lack of real interactions of these characters with Wolverine failed to enrich the story further.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is great as Wolverine as always but then how many more time can we see him playing the same character again and again? Wolverine as a character is an outstanding character when you see how different he is compared to other X-men, but Fox and Seed Productions failed to capitalise on this very important aspect. Gambit is very cool although I think a lot of Gambit fans would want to see more of him.<br /><br />In terms of production values, there are some awkward moments in the movie that you wonder how could they spent so much money and yet failed to check their cgi's before releasing it. The most notable scenes are the farmhouse bathroom scene and the Professor X scene, which is so obvious that they were incomplete or over-polished. I think that is something quite unforgivable when it comes to a Sci-Fi / X-men movie.<br /><br />All in all, X-men Origins: Wolverine is an enjoyable movie without dull moments. However, how much more can Fox and Marvel bank in on this character will depend on how they approach this character in the future. They wouldn't want to kill the character like Warner Brothers did with Batman or it will go down the history as a joke. The movie is full of actions and great fighting, but it does need a stronger and richer story with stronger and richer characters to support it.pect.

1416550542|5.0|Wow. What an incredible journey I've been on reading this book. When I read the last few pages, I just burst into tears, the book was that good. What a beautiful storyteller the author is, I've never seen anything quite like it. The recurring themes in the book are beautifully woven and meaningful and you are left breathless and spent, your mind revisiting the characters (and the themes) over and over again. This has officially become my top favorite book of all time...

B00171NZE4|4.0|I found this DVD to be amazing! A pretty solid setlist, a nice running show and it's always nice to see the original members together and rocking the show. My only complaint is that the audio mixing didn't seem up to par. That is just my picky opinion, it still sounds great.   An example of what I mean by mixing is, Jonathan Davis' singing is sometimes drowned out from the guitars, sometimes David's drumming is lower than it should be and doesn't really blend well with the loud bass. It seems to be fixed throughout the DVD but is not consistent. I would still recommend this buy, it was in no means a waste of my money.
0061565407|5.0|My book club read this book and we all loved it! The story of a family going through difficult times as seen through the eyes of their beloved dog was poignant, funny and much more spiritual than I would have expected. The difficult issues (especially death) are handled in a thoughtful but unsentimental way, so that I did not feel my emotions were being manipulated as I often do with other books.  And the end is so uplifting and wonderful.    I immediately gave this book to my husband and he truly enjoyed it too; and he tends to be much more critical of books and movies than I am.

B001TOVZYQ|5.0|This movie is great on many levels. Great story, interesting history, great characters and the best martial movie I have seen in years. Wing Chun is a widely practiced martial art, but few people have every seen it presented in such a powerful and vivid manner.  If you have every studied Wing Chun or wanted to, this is a must see/have film.  The chain punching sequences alone are worth the price of this DVD set.

B000BB1MI2|4.0|Okay, let me get this straight.  Here are pros and cons of the film:  Pro:  -It's more like the book than the 1971 version (for example, the scene where Veruca goes down the garbage chute, in the book there are squirrals, not geese that lay golden eggs! How stupid can one be?!)  -It actually shown where the Oompaa Loompas lived at  -It shows the toothpaste factory where Charlie's dad worked at.  -Two words: Tim Burton.  -It showed what Willy Wonka's childhood was like (I would hate having those braces and a psychopathic dentist for a father)  -It's actually called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, not Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (it makes it sound like Willy found a golden ticket)  -The visuals were amazing.  -The songs were right.  Cons:  -Veruca wasn't bratty enough (to tell you truth, I prefer the 1971 version of Veruca)  -Mike Teavee didn't play video games (I guess they wanted to make it more modern)  -Stupid people think that Willy Wonka is based off of Michael Jackson.  It is not, you brainless people!    Other then that, I'm fine with this movie.  I saw this twice when it came out in theaters.  I can't wait what he does to Alice in Wonderland (which is btw, my favorite book).

B001H68KG2|5.0|Believe it or not I had never even heard of Tom Waits until 1995 and I'm now 37!! Hard to believe someone never heard of dear Tom! Closing Time was one of my first attempts at Tom's music...and easily one of my favorites. He has the touching and wistful \\"Martha\\" along with my favorite, Grapefruit Moon, which I could listen to forever. I much prefer Tom's earlier music...he actually sings more instead of grovels on...either talking or attempting to grovel on and sing. That groveling, although it's signature Tom, can be really grating and depressing if you're noting in the right mood for it. The songs on Closing Time are a brilliant start from Tom who has gone on to make many more of my favorites, particularly \\"Songbird\\" while, although not on \\"Closing Time\\", is just beautifully relaxing straight music with no lyrics at all. Tom is that talented where he can pull off a song with just music!! It says alot about him as an artist.  If you're interested in starting a \\"Tom\\" collection this would be a wonderful first buy!

6304539290|5.0|These are the 1997 Special Editions in Widescreen. Most people hate these versions with a passion, but that is because they do not realize that the 2004 DVDs are different from these. These are the versions seen during the grand 1997 theatrical rerelease. The set consists of the silver Vader slipcase with three tapes housed inside. They have about 5 minutes of behind the scenes stuff at the beginning. These versions are only available on VHS and Laserdisc. I have a feeling that these 97 versions will never see the light of day on DVD.

031606792X|2.0|While readers of the Twilight Series can take the third book as a sign of what the fourth book will offer to the reader. This is by far the most disappointing book of the series. The writing is slow and the story really seems to be reaching for anything. When reading this novel I felt that Meyer was rushing to the end that we all new was coming from the first book but not sure how to actually get there. There are also uncomfortable parts of this novel that I would think should be inappropiate for people under 18 years old. There is much more violence, incest and sex in this novel than the three before them.     There are some moments of beautiful writing which seems to surround the character of Jacob and the werewolves in this novel. But it is not enough to pick this book up and read it if you are not reading through the series. I will not give anything away as to plot in this review, well for two reasons if you read any of the books or seen the movie you already know the plot and two there is not much plot to give away. I have to admit though the last chapters of the novel made me laugh out loud, but I am positive that it was not Meyer's intention.     [...]

J.J.Abrams of TV's LOST & the Mission Impossible series shows how the famous crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise first comes aboard to explore strange new worlds. Talk about \\"no win scenario\\"...the big question in the minds of fans and non-fans alike: can younger actors fill these enormous space boots.The answer is yes, but with a major role for the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, time traveling of course, there's no need to worry about the absence of the original crew.<br /><br />Chris Pine's take on impulsive space cowboy James T. Kirk is no SNL parody of Shatner's portrayal but recognizable (although as the climax draws near he scores some very Capt. Kirk classic moments \\"I've got your gun.\\"). Zachary Quinto a.k.a Sylar-Spock is perfect as a young Vulcan (with a girlfriend!). Karl Urban is dead on a Leonard \\"Bones\\" Mcoy with maybe the coolest intro in the film. Uhura is played by Zoe Saldana who is a great likeness of young Nichelle Nichols, but with so much more to do, than poor Nichelle. The same can't be said for Chekov, Sulu and Scott who had less important places in the big picture, but were each well played, Simon Pegg's Scotty was great fun.<br /><br />Without given too, much away, some answers....Does a \\"Red Shirt\\" die? Ho yeah...Does Kirk tear his shirt? Nah...Does Bones declare someone \\"Dead, Jim?\\" Sorta...Nerve Pinch? Got `em....Warp Speed?  The Best ever!!!....Beam ins and outs? Yes and much more (can you say space-dive?)...How about the KOBAYASHI MARU test? I prequel has to have it right? Yes, it is in there and may even live up to expectations, too!<br /><br />Due to interference by a future Romulian, Nero, play brilliantly by Eric Bana, an alternate timeline is created. While strikingly similar to the original Trek, the movie ends with many things already clearly different from the series (like Capt. Pike's final fate).

0307408833|3.0|Ok I was very excited for this cookbook to come out. I will say however, that I have been to the actual bakery and was not overly impressed by the product. The cupcake I tried was very dry, almost stale tasting, The crumbcake and chocolate chip cookie were both pretty good. I felt that if I purchased the cookbook and made the items at home I would have better results. I will tell you that I have not made any of the recipes yet. I know, I also hate when someone reviews a cookbook without trying the recipes first but I have reasons for hesitating...First the author claims that these are \\"good for you\\" and \\"healthy recipes\\". Take a look at the bakery's website, you can check out the nutritional value for each item..some have over 26g of fat!! Not really sure about this. Maybe she means that because the ingredients are all-natural, they are healthy. Also if you go to Gourmet magazines website you will find a review for the cookbook. It is mostly a positive review however the reviewer said that the frosting recipe looks and smells like cement..Come on. They are famous for cupcakes. Why publish a recipe that does not work? So what do I do? The ingredients that the author suggests are very expensive. Please post  if you actually have tried the recipes and know from experience..yeah,being the authors relative does not count.
B001TOD92C|5.0|There's a scene in THE WRESTLER where Mickey Rourke, the once mighty \\"Ram\\" who fought the villainous \\"Ayatollah\\" in a classic bout at Madison Square Garden twenty years previously, is walking from the \\"backstage area\\" at a big suburban supermarket to the deli counter where he now works. We've seen him take a similar walk earlier in the movie, at the end of which he parts the curtains and hears the roar of an excited crowd.  At the deli, all that awaits are customers likely to be persnickety about how much potato salad he puts into their containers.  Darren Aronofksy's movie features incredible, heartbreaking performances from Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. The film itself offers a poignant look at the price of fame, the world of wrestling, the complexities of life, the emotional simplicity of fan adoration, and the punishment a performer is willing to put himself -- and his family -- through in a desperate attempt to make the cheering last forever.
1401200605|4.0|Since the beggining Hush was a story full of hype and expectation. And of course, if you read it with that much expectation, you won't like it. It's Batman's, it's Loeb's and Jim Lee's, but certainly it's not definitive.    Ok, ok, let's go easy, from there it looks like i didn't liked the story, and I did. Seriously. I really like Jim Lee's art and Loeb's stories may be goos sometimes. But that's the thing: it's Jim Lee and Jeph Loeb, so you should read expecting lots of - amazing - splash pages and cliffhangers all over the series.    I think it's better if I don't tell anything about the plot because I read it all once in a paperback edition here in Brazil, but it deals with Batman's past, a love case involving he and a women, some famous characters and villains. So if you like Gotham City's wolrd, you probably will like the story.    Hush may not be what you're looking for if you are wanting a classic, but if you want e cool and exciting Blockbuster and a few hours of fun, then you got it.

The way Jillian's set the system up helps me to get through the workout.  You only do each move 30-60 seconds.  When you feel you can't make it, it's time to switch to something else.

B001AVEJ1Y|4.0|So much action, humor, and genuine adventure permeates J.J. Abrams' Star Trek that those unfamiliar with the ground-breaking television series will undoubtedly find entertainment in the sheer excitement of the renowned space travelers' re-envisioned maiden voyage. For those well versed in the annals of Star Trek lore, every inspired casting choice, catch phrase, and brilliantly re-imagined staple of the original universe will likely bring accolades of approval and nostalgic revelry. And for those on middle ground, even the troublesome time-shattering paradoxes at the heart of the story's conflict can't diminish the enjoyment derived from witnessing such a worthy - and much needed - serious rejuvenation of an integral part of science fiction's canon.<br /><br />James T. Kirk's brash, rebellious, and authority-opposed nature has always guided him into formidable predicaments. However, his extreme intelligence and aversion to defeat has found him enrolled in the Federation Starfleet- a path his father also chose long ago. When a distress signal is sent out by the planet Vulcan, Kirk finds his way onto the USS Enterprise to join fellow graduates McCoy (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho), and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), as well as the stone-faced and logic-driven Spock (Zachary Quinto), to engage in a colossal mission to save Earth - and the universe - from a maniacal renegade warlord (Eric Bana).<br /><br />2009 seems to be the summer of prequels, starting with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, followed by Star Trek then Angels & Demons. What's most inspired about Trek is its amazing cast - they've somehow managed to get actors who look surprisingly like their older counterparts and have a familiar chemistry that makes them believable as younger versions of the famous starship crew. Like all of the reinventions of popular franchises flooding cinemas in the last few years, Star Trek tops its predecessors with stunning special effects, riveting adventure, legendary catch phrases, an intense plot that remains generally serious even with a satisfying blend of humor, and origins scenes that provoke generous applaud from longtime fans. So it hardly matters if the ice monsters of Delta Vega reek of Star Wars (both The Empire Strikes Back and The Phantom Menace).<br /><br />The plot itself is a mixture of complex alternate realities, supernovas, black holes, red matter and science-fiction jargon, but the pacing is keen. With intimidating starship designs, unmatched space battle CG, stirring music, and the classic crew inheriting their positions to create a perfectly balanced camaraderie, Star Trek goes to great lengths to appeal to both diehard Trekkies and the curious but uneducated. Many previous films catered too much to familiar audiences, making this updated, contemporary, shiny new Trek movie a great place to jump aboard and become a fan.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsintense plot that remains generally serious even with a satisfying blend of humor, and origins scenes that provoke generous applaud from longtime fans.

B000000Y2R|4.0|It was still at least a decade later that Jazz would expand its vocabulary to keep things consistently fresh, but as far as old-time, live bebop is concerned, it's hard to think of a better starting, and finishing, point than this.
B001AVEJ1Y|1.0|In the theatre, this film was preceded by a trailer for the new Transformers movie. Watching the film, I thought 1) that it was oddly similar to the Transformers trailer, and 2) actually, the Transformers movie would probably have been more fun.    The original Star Trek [[ASIN:B001DHXT6G series]] had two primary strengths. The first was the theme of friendship between the main characters (especially Kirk, Spock and McCoy). This went beyond Starfleet loyalty. Kirk could be assailed by powerful bad guys, but he was also surrounded by people in whom he could place complete trust.    This film takes its cues from superhero flicks like [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight]], where the hero is a paranoid loner who can't trust anyone with his secrets. Like the superhero flicks, the film requires an [[ASIN:B00005JNJV origin story]], so when it starts, the characters don't know each other yet. So Kirk doesn't yet have any friends, and furthermore the writers want him to come in conflict with Spock because that's what's supposed to happen in these types of things. But that conflict goes to ludicrous extremes. The motivation for the scene where Kirk goes to the ice planet is insane. From the point of view of any normal person, no matter how annoying Kirk was being, Spock's response constitutes a psychopathic abuse of power, making him totally unfit for service. The non-insane thing to do would have been to put Kirk in the brig. I realize that the only reason the writers used this setup was because they needed a plot device that would get Kirk to meet the visitor down on the planet without Spock knowing. But if this was the best the writers could do, they should have been fired in the early stages of the screenwriting.    The second main strength of the Trek franchise was the particular acting style it attracted. Star Trek was the last refuge of an old-fashioned style of acting, more commonly seen in old black-and-white Hollywood movies. It was fake, but it was classy. All the best Star Trek actors -- Ricardo Montalban, Christopher Plummer, Mark Lenard, Patrick Stewart, Marc Alaimo, and yes, William Shatner -- were able to use Star Trek to give masterful performances in this style. There is a reason why many Star Trek actors did Shakespeare at some point in their lives.    But here, let's just say that this line of thought never entered into anybody's mind. Here, the character of Kirk is shown as a type common to many contemporary films -- the unpleasant [[ASIN:B001ECQ75A slacker]] who nonetheless succeeds at everything just because of his innate greatness, which requires no effort to develop. Words cannot describe how irritating his simpering, sneering face is in this film. This was actually not the way Kirk did things in the original series, despite his reputation for rashness. Even in the sixties TV show, where he was supposed to be a man's man, he always showed great concern for his crew. Whenever a red-shirt died, Kirk would always make at least a token display of sorrow. It showed that he understood the risks involved, and it also implied that he put at least some care into his plans. But here, Kirk's primary concerns are to satisfy his ego and impress girls. This leads to one admittedly funny scene in the dorm room, but it is extremely unsympathetic motivation for a starship captain.    Kirk's characterization in this film is not merely different from the original series. It's actually worse. It gives Kirk no redeeming qualities.    Some of the supporting characters are better, but they get very little screen time. The guy doing McCoy is quite good. Unsurprisingly, this is because he sticks more closely to the original character than anybody else (he does the voice well). His lines are almost entirely recycled from McCoy's catch-phrases. The best character overall is, unexpectedly, Uhura, who squeezes something out of the hack screenplay by expressing some sexy compassion for Spock. This is the only likeable emotion in the film.    The film is extremely hyperactive. The set design looks like it might be visually interesting, but the camera cuts through each shot before you can see what's going on. For this reason, the action sequences create the impression of confusion instead of action. You don't have time to thrill over Sulu's swordfight because you don't see most of the moves. You don't see the actual feats of dexterity.    At the end, I wondered why the film took so much time. It's more than two hours long, the second [[ASIN:B00005JKHP longest]] Trek film ever. But what takes up those two hours? Aside from Kirk's pouty-lipped pretty-boy, is there a character that the film spends a lot of time on? The villain in Star Trek is usually good for exaggerated drama, but Nero only gets a couple of lines of exposition when he talks to Christopher Pike. The Romulans here are like grungy barbarian versions of the Romulans in [[ASIN:B000A6T1KE Nemesis]] (formerly the worst Star Trek film, until now), with the same dank atmosphere in their ship.    No, really, why is the thing so long? It doesn't even contain a bona fide space battle. It flies through so many things so frenetically (Kirk's father's dramatic farewell to his wife! Spock's dramatic farewell to his mother! the Kobayashi Maru test!) that it ends up showing absolutely nothing.    Do not give these people your money. If you want Star Trek, watch [[ASIN:B0000683DH The Wrath Of Khan]]. If you want an action flick, watch [[ASIN:B000VR0570 Transformers]].    Oh, one more thing. The only explanation of the Federation (the society in which humans live) in the film is the one given by Christopher Pike: \\"The Federation is a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada.\\" Not once does anybody mention exploring the galaxy. It does not enter into Kirk's motivation at all. There is something deeply wrong about that.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|I've owned copies of this classic science fiction movie since the '80s.  I've upgraded my copy from VCR tape to Director's Cut and now to the final version.  I like the movie as it stands now and the little tweaks that Ridley Scott put in to correct past mistakes now makes it more enjoyable.  I would have liked it if he had put in some of the scenes that were left out described in the out takes and documentary on the DVD, but this film is what it is and I will enjoy it for many years to come.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I've been a die hard Star Trek fan for all of my life. I was raised on Star Trek. I love every aspect of it. Even the movies that didn't do so well, I still love those. When I saw this movie, it blew my mind. I loved the action and the humor that they put throughout the movie. While it did create its own nitch it still had the same good feeling of Star Trek behind it. The same familiar characters. I was so pleased with it I couldn't stop smiling. The redesign of the Enterprise was amazing. First I wasn't sure, still love the old, but I love this one too.     Personally I feel that it actually is the best Star Trek film in quite a while. It also has a more approachable feel to it for those that aren't or haven't been Star Trek fans. It doesn't stick to the old formula. It has diversity in its locations, amazing action scenes. From hand-to-hand weaponry to the large ship battles. Beautiful in every way. Even though it messes with the original sequence of events its still great. It might even help because now it makes this new era of movies somewhat unpredictable which is always interesting.     I wouldn't change a thing about this movie. In the future I hope to see at least another Star Trek movie with the exact cast(which was perfectly cast), the same director, same music composer, and the same special effects team. I'll be there to see this movie and the next again and again. I would recommend this movie for anyone who's looking to have a great movie experience, not just Star Trek fans.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Listened to this on cassette in my friends truck, I think we wore it out. Cruising the beach in the summertime. The girls, underage drinking, all those rites of passage from the 70's(and now-who knows). Van Halens first album is still my favorite. Nobody had it all layed out for them more than these guys, then the differences like so many others. It's a shame.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|The quality of this season 1 of Mad Men on Blu-ray is very good.  Which is fitting for the very good production of this series.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|Just like many of the reviewers here have mentioned the plastic casing for the DVDs looks extremely cheap and filmsy. A corner in one of the DVD trays in my copy have been chipped off, but luckily there aren't any major damage (as some have reported of cracked/severely damaged trays). I paid $250 for mine (coz it's on sale) and it's pretty worth it compared to buying the whole thing on itunes or in independent seasons. I won't say that this is the ultimate deal if you're a ST:TNG fan but i'ts a pretty good deal for those that wishes to collect the whole series and is budget conscious. DVD are in SD (Standard DVD) quality and are in full screen. I wish they are available in HD and Widescreen versions as well, maybe the producers of the show will make those versions available in the future (remastered?).

0553807048|5.0|Whether you like or dislike Jordan Belfort, this is an entertaining book that is very funny at parts. The nicknames that he gives to each person in his life makes it enjoyable. A funny part is when he talks about the father that gets angry whenever the phone rings. He is upset that someone is calling on a Tuesday afternoon. Who would call at such a time? Although Jordan probably doesn't realize it, a very important part of the book talks about how wasteful some of his spending was and what it means now. He unintentionally gets the reader to realize money is not important if you have your kid's love. I personally like this style of writing. Totally different than the first book, because I think that he must have brushed up his writing skills and studied \\"entertainment writing\\" if there was such a subject. Although expensive, this book was a good investment on laughter and interest. I absolutely loved it!!
B00005V9IJ|5.0|I think it's sad that the movie industry is all about money and the public gets treated like ADD nation. They don't think anyone can possibly sit through a whole movie without violence or sex in it and still be interested enough to watch it. I'll lump the 42 reviewers here into ADD nation as not having an attention span longer than 3 minutes. No one seems to care about being able to educate anyone or move anyone emotionally. Movies can mean so much to us. They can educate, change opinions, or move a person to do something positive in there lives. The last great movie I've seen in the theater was this one. Tom Hanks deserved an Oscar for this one.

I know every word by heart...and if I'm feeling sad, or happy I can pop it in the DVD player to make my day.  I think that says something about a movie, most of us don't know why we pick it, just how it makes us feel.  And this movie does it for me!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|One of the better Star Trek movies, after the Undiscovered Country. I went with mixed expectations. But left the theater with a great feeling, this film has completely revamped the series. It might just spark another TV series...    If you're a Trek fan and you don't mind a little messing with the story line, it's well worth the money you spend to see it on the silver screen.

B000003TA4|5.0|For all those doubters, it has been nearly 20 years since the release of Nevermind, and it is still more important that any music made since. This album has the staying power of The Beatles, with all the credibility of The Ramones. Essential recording from the last great band in the so called \\"rock and roll\\" genre.
B001LMU182|2.0|Had a chance to look at this Blu-ray release of what is arguably the greatest Anime movie ever created.  After the thoroughly disappointing Pioneer release on DVD, I was hoping somebody would have gotten a clue and included the original English audio track (as the Region 4 DVD release does).    Alas, this version only provides the \\"new\\" English audio track -- the politically correct version made just for America.  What's the point of having 50GB of room if you can't even include the original English track?  I don't recommend this for anybody who really cares about the film.  5 stars for the improved picture, but minus 3 for the horrible \\"new\\" English audio track being the only option.  Wanna produce dubs for repressed Americans?  Then start making your own animated movies!

Picked up two Micro SD 16 gig memory sticks...followed instructions and formatted both cards in device with PSP. Worked perfectly right from word go. After formatting...29 gigs free. Immediately downloaded my blu ray ripped mp4's...over a dozen, stuck about fifteen of my cd's ripped to wave files and had room left over for Einhander and Killzone(no lag time for games different from pro duo cards)....with over 9 gigs left over!        No problems with the device...the micro sd chips are now permanent residents of the device. It fits perfectly in the pro duo slot...and I rarely remove it. A great buy for me. And when the micro sd 32 gigs come available...(its available only in asia only) I will pick up another device. No transplanting sd cards. A separate device I will purchase for each new set of cards. I won't be going back to Pro Duos. I have my eyes on the new sdxc cards. I will expect a new photo flash adapter specially configured to take the new sdxc format...if necessary.
1416550542|5.0|Oh my gosh, I loved this one. Such an epic story, filled with fairy tales and mystery. A four year old child is found on a boat dock in Australia in the early 1900's. She does not know her name or where she came from. All she has with her is a small white case and a book of fairy tales. She spends her adult life trying to find out who she really is and when she passes, her granddaughter picks up the trail. This book was so good and everything a good mystery should be. Usually I have mysteries figured out halfway through, but this one had me guessing until the end.

It's still fun to watch........Just Keep Swimming!!
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Jason Statham is well on his way to becoming typecast. It seems like he's in a ton of these kind of action films lately, although this movie is a bit more subdued and complicated than some of them. At least in this heist flick, there are several twists and turns and you have to stay alert to follow who is exactly on the up-and-up and who isn't, and Statham isn't punching out 10 people at once.    This is another one of these modern-day films in which the crooks, the thieves, the bandits - whatever - are the \\"good guys\\" and the police and the government officials are the bad guys. This seems to be a big favorite of the anti-authority filmmakers world in the last 40 years whether it's in Hollywood or London.     Regardless, it's a very entertaining film and Statham and company are fun to watch. That's also nothing new as the tough \\"Transporter\\" star has become a regular at playing these kind of nice guy/macho/thug roles.    Actually, everyone is pretty much a creep in this film, just to varying degrees. They are all interesting, too, and several of the minor characters have a good sense of humor, too.  Add some very tense robbery scenes, some sex early on, some double-crosses later and you have a very serious Keystone Cops type story where you're never quite sure what crazy thing is going to happen next.

0307454894|1.0|I read this book in under 3 hours, simply because I just wanted to get it finished. I don't give up on a  book, even one as awful as this.       Truly, I sensed no emotion and very little depth. The story is not remotely interesting and the characters are nothing but names. It is completely dull and did not make me wonder once what was going to happen next. I could not have cared less.       The people who find this book amazing and thought provoking and worthy of deep discussion are reading into things just aren't there, or even hinted at. There's just nothing to this story.        Schlink, on pg 118, has the narrator referencing another book. Of it, he says, \\"It does not invite one to identify with it and makes no one sympathetic...\\" I smiled as soon as I read those words because he had just described his own book perfectly.    Don't bother with this one.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|I think this dvd is awesome. It really shows how much goes into a concert really. Not to mention the things that go on tour. Living in a bus isn't easy and these guys are living proof of that. I mean one girl with all guys? jeez. I love the emotion that goes into some of these songs too. And I was impressed at how good they are live. They barely sound anything different from the record. Definitely worth it. Not to mention you can listen to the whole tour on the cd that comes with it. Cheers to this.
B001HN697M|4.0|Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans, is an action packed and exciting prequel. Though, some of the scenes are very dark, overall the video is good.    The sound is good during the action sequences. During scenes where there is dialog, the dialog is whispered. Overall, audio is fair.    I thought the story was good, yet the ending was disappointing. They should have come up with an ending that offered something new. Instead, they chose to bridge the ending (adding overdubbed dialog) with the first movie, Underworld, regarding Viktor and Selene's relationship. This comes off as treating the audience as forgetful simpletons, who need to be spoon fed plot points.    I am looking forward to a fourth installment that hopefully will offer something new and will not take the audience for granted.
4883191028|1.0|I had to use this series during my study abroad semesters in Japan. Having already found great success with the Genki series, Minna no Nihongo was highly irritating. The English explanations of the grammar points were written in very ambiguous language that could be taken to mean anything. They were obviously written by a Japanese person who is trying to sound more intelligent than they actually are, which just sounds deranged. Furthermore, all the grammatical changes are taught starting from the -masu verb form! If you do this it's almost impossible to find any pattern in Japanese verb changes, therefore learning the grammar doesn't come about through understanding but from rote memorization. Grammar is too complex to learn this way, it needs to be understood not memorized. The authors act as though there is no such thing as the plain form of a verb, which is just crazy. No I'm sorry they bring it up in the second book and treat it like a special grammar point. They make you memorize how to construct the plain form FROM the -masu form! This is clearly backward and, well, crazy. That's the only word for it. The idea that some schools have the audacity to require you to learn Japanese this way brings back old memories of \\"indescribable frustration\\". The only explanation for this incompetence is the underlying truth that many Japanese people deep down don't believe that it is possible for foreigners to learn their language. Don't believe me? Try speaking Japanese in Japan. You'll see what I mean. On top of all its flaws, to use this book effectively you will need both the main text and the translation book with you at all times and you have to coordinate between the two, knowing full well that you are doing things in an inefficient manner. Now I want you to imagine yourself sitting there juggling these two nonsensical texts, are you doing that? good. Now try to visualize a future where you are able to function effectively in everyday life using Japanese. Careful, yourhead might explode. Do yourself a favor, start with Genki I and II, then move onto An Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese, and start learning kanji as soon as possible.

B00011KHTM|4.0|I bought this for my new aluminum MacBook to connect to a flat panel VGA monitor.  I read the Amazon reviews about this product, which said that people bought it for their \\"MacBook,\\" but didn't realize that they were written for the earlier generation MacBooks, which use the mini-DVI.  The new aluminum MacBooks now use a different port, the MiniDisplay port, which is much smaller than the mini-DVI slot and looks kinda like a mini-USB port, except with rounded corners on the bottom.      Luckily, I was able to exchange this product with no problems.  I contacted the seller, CE Compass, who very professionally just allowed me to exchange it and I only ended up paying $5.95 shipping, which is much better than having to buy a new one and keep an adaptor I couldn't use.  I even had already opened the packaging, and they didn't charge me any sort of \\"restocking\\" fee for that.      So, if you have the new Aluminum MacBook 13-inch, don't get this one!  Get the mini-Display port to VGA adaptor, also available on Amazon.  I can't really speak for MacBook Pro.  I think the MacBook Pro came with the aluminum body earlier than the MacBook.  I think the miniDisplay port is only on the newest generation of MacBook Pro's with the unibody aluminum body.  (Note: this review was written in May 2009)    By the way, I do like the mini-Display port to VGA adaptor just fine.  It worked immediately and it's just great to be able to have that second monitor there so you can stretch out your workspace and windows across two monitors.
006135323X|5.0|Warning: this book is as difficult to put down as it is to forget! A fascinating read, _Predictably Irrational_ shows how we are not as rational in our decision-making and behaviors as we may think. As the author Dan Ariely points out \\"We are all pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend\\" and are susceptible to a myriad of (often hidden) irrelevant contextual influences. The good news is that our errors in judgment are often systematic and predictable, and can be dramatically reduced with awareness, insight, and the right tools, methods, and policies to help us make better decisions. An irresistible (and constantly entertaining!) synthesis of research, explanations, and tools, _Predictably Irrational_ helps bridge the gap between the irrational and the desirable.
