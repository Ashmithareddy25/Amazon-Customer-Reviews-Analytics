B008Q09K2U|2.0|Sometimes I think Nelson DeMille has two personalities.  One writes on adrenaline and focuses on twists and excitement. The other personality gets bogged down in detail and long winded descriptions.<br />The latter personality is responsible for The Panther.<br />This book seems to move at the slowest pace.  The opening chapter was intriguing and from there it's painful until the last few chapters.  Whilst there's a few funny points along the way, this book is far from DeMille's best.  If you enjoy action and books that keep you hooked all the way through give this one a swerve, it doesn't deliver.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is one of my favs. I love how you can choose all kinds of different blades. I think its a fun challenge for anyone of any age. Warning: This game is highly addicting.<br />Stay awesome.<br />Hawkflight of Riverclan
B0034DGPEU|2.0|A story that must be told, but written better, and with more development of the characters. I have read a lot about slavery, so the details were not new to me. I am glad so many people are reading this book, but I feel the subject matter deserved more.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Darren breaks it down into simple, easy steps to accomplish anything! Highly recommend this book. If you ever have a chance to hear this man speak...do it! Very motivating!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|This movie surprised me by being quite a bit better than I thought it would be.  The special effects were good and Charlize Theron was excellent as the Queen.

B0011ZWKDS|5.0|This is the best Tarja Nightwish to me but you can almost hear that the band was ready for a different singer. Weird. I love it though. Tarja sounds amazing. The band is better than any other cd up to this point. The next two are better though. Imaginaerum is the bomb.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Easy read, I love the casual 80's references and characterization. Description isn't overbearing, and has some interesting future components. Enjoyable, especially if you know or you are a gamer.
B002RCEBBI|5.0|I love it all. I like them even more than Nightwish. The singer is great. The music has dynamics and depth. Buy them all.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Haven't seen the movie because I wanted to read the book first. If you like apocalyptic-themed books, this one is a must.
B009GX6600|5.0|worth every penny, but then I've watched this show from the start. Who doesn't love watching Mark Harmon in anything he's in.
0312576463|4.0|I agree with some of the criticisms about less than realistic dialogue, but came to understand and sympathize with the characters because they found something or someone to which to be devoted. I think this plays well with families from the Midwest (or in John Irving's case, families from the northeast) who find some escape from the coastal cynicism that also appears in this work. The first 50 pages are pretty slow, but the characters' lives begin to be woven together and one finds that devotion to one another and above all, the love of Walter as a pure being, are the central themes here. Even after letting Joey go live with obnoxious republicans, Patty supports him as he becomes part of the mercenary republican machine (yes, the politics are pretty superficial and expressed without subtlety here). There is also a lot of irony woven in as Patty escapes from a woman who is obsessed with her only to later nearly die for her obsession with Walter. This all brings up the bigger questions of what our individual lives really mean without our family members and loved ones by our side. The inevitable comparison is to the John Irving novels, which are much more beautifully and realistically written but Franzen is a powerful writer. The individual stories are amusing and touching. The scheme to destroy huge tracts of land in the name of environmentalism is a hilarious commentary on the corporatization of everything including \\"big environmentalism.\\" Walter's drug-addled speech to West Virginia's new additions to the \\"middle class\\" is the high point of political narrative. His purity as a character is a bit too over the top and he needs some more flaws, but he was certainly fun to read. As a middle aged male, it is also fun to fantasize about a beautiful idealistic 27 year old falling in love with him! Believable? Not so much. Enjoyable, sad, funny and special in places, definitely.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great Book was good from start to finish was not hard to get into would HIGHLY recommend. Now just waiting for the last one to come out so can't wait.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I wish it wouldn't end so quickly I love the way the characters developed, they are getting older and so are the readers and I like the way riordan  is doing this.

B009YU6FJM|5.0|I have been a Deftones fan since day one and I still listen to Adrenaline on a frequent basis.  I love this band and have enjoyed all of their previous albums.  After giving Koi No Yokan a few play throughs I can honestly say that this is, far and away, the best Deftones album to be released since White Pony!  I think I'll probably end up enjoying Koi No Yokan more than White Pony when all is said and done because of the flow.  This album moves seamlessly from one track to the next and is masterfully produced.  There isn't a weak track on the album, unlike White Pony, which had a couple that were less-than-stellar.  Koi No Yokan is an album that I could listen to over and over again, no matter what my mood...the music on this album is just that good.  This is the most mature Deftones album to-date and it shows the true progression of this band through the years.  If you are a true Deftones fan you already have the album, but if you are a sceptic of another mid-grade Deftones release, or are new to the band than this is an album that you simply have to purchase.  Give it a listen and you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Happy listening!!! :D
B004FP1WX0|1.0|I'm spoiling parts of this movie, although spoil is a strong term for this horrible film.<br /><br />The movie was billed as some sort of thriller and I even had friends tell me the ending was amazing and would be nothing like what I expected.  Nothing could have been farther from the truth.  If you were to tell me that you were making a documentary about someone who started an online relationship and asked me how you think that might end, I would have suggested the same thing that happened in this movie.  A lonely housewife pretends to be a younger girl and gets involved with a young guy?  Half the people on online dating sites are doing the same thing, absolutely nothing at all is shocking or unbelievable about this, it's the most pedestrian thing in the world.  She may have gone further than some people by creating 15 different Facebook profiles and having 2 separate phones, but the only unbelievable part is that after finding out she's a pathological liar, Nev doesn't de-friend her on Facebook (although anyone with 700+ friends on Facebook is obviously not the discriminating type).  It's not sad or poignant or any of the other things people are trying to make it.  Just about everybody has a friend who has a story about an online date gone wrong, and usually you laugh about it.  If you dug into the liar's back story about why they were lonely and lied you might feel sad for them, but more than likely you and your friends didn't bother because you were too busy joking about it.  And if you had revelations about how you go about your online activities because of this movie, well, please send me $100 for my miracle chocolate that helps you actually lose weight.  It's delicious AND slimming!

B008RC72G8|5.0|I originally saw the film at the theatre and was kind of indifferent about it.  But I got such a deal on the Blu-ray I couldn't pass it up.  Watching it a second time, even knowing what would happen, was much better than the first time.  Odd, but maybe the anticipation added to it.  It's a fun flick.

B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Spaceballs, the movie!  Merchandizing!  Just love this film and had to get it on Blu-ray for the better sound and the additional extras.  Do watch the movie and then watch it again with Mel's commentary.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|One of the best books I have read recently. At its heart it is a love story but with lots of unexpected twists to the plot. Especially towards the end.
B009ESIGHI|5.0|This is on the top of my Christmas movie list. The music is great. My kids love it. They did take a song out from the original DVD release but I did not even notice until the end of the movie.

B009VB97EY|1.0|This movie was horrible.  No real plot and horrible acting.  The guys were hot, but it did not live up to all the hype.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire; however I have not been able to invite friends through Facebook.  Very frustrating!
B000063JZQ|3.0|I teach \\"Macbeth\\" to remedial-level seniors.  It wasn't my choice of play and I don't enjoy the story much.  That said, this film does help to get the students through--more because it gives them something to laugh at than anything else.<br /><br />The film isn't a straight adaptation.  It takes some liberties with the order of the scenes, removes some scenes/characters, and moves some dialogue around, especially when it comes to converting spoken lines to voice-overs.  The acting is average at best, as are the sets and costumes.  The fight scenes are laughably slow.  More than anything, some of the dialogue is obviously overdubbed, especially with MacDuff.  Much like the play itself, it doesn't do much to convey the passage of time and its effects on Macbeth's mindset.  Over than a little make-up to make him older, that is.<br /><br />When I show this, I don't censor the nudity of the witches or of MacDuff's son.  It's truly gratuitous nudity--and not in the way most filmmakers would do it.  My students are 18-19, so I let them watch it.  I wouldn't do that if you have younger students.<br /><br />Because I use this while teaching the play, I only watch part of the film at a time, as the students read it.  For this, it serves well enough to help students understand the gist of the action.  It's not great, by any means.  But, I poke fun of the film (I also teach a Film class that most of my students have to take) and we get some laughs (probably inappropriate ones) out of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is addictive and a fun way to pass the time. I would give it 5 stars if the prices for a new game didn't increase each level. Don't worry this isn't a pay to play game for each game you pass you earn money to purchase new games.
B0042UEU8M|4.0|I thought the story was very good and kept your interest throughout the movie.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this product because it is so easy to use.  I am a teacher and this app makes grading a breeze.  Never buying a calculator ever again.

1594202249|5.0|Some reviewers have dismissed \\"Inherent Vice\\" as a sort of \\"Pynchon Lite\\". I don't agree.<br /><br />I think his \\"oeuvre\\" can be (sort of) classified in two different threads: a complex world of characters, situations and thoughts (\\"V\\", \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\", \\"Mason & Dixon\\", \\"Against the Day\\") and the \\"other\\" books which on the surface are lighter (and also shorter): \\"The Crying of Lot 49\\", \\"Vineland\\", \\"Inherent Vice\\".<br /><br />But lighter (less weight) does not mean \\"diet literature\\". In all the \\"light\\" books there is a common thread which is very insightful and deep. Its the case with \\"Inherent Vice\\".<br /><br />Also with \\"Vineland\\". Most reviewers have been very dismissive about this work, however I found it engrossing and *very* perceptive. In fact it presages the \\"secret\\" CIA \\"rendition\\" flights by about 15 or 20 years.<br /><br />So think of Pynchon as an author that has two paralell threads, one of very wide scope (the traditional, and heavier books\\") and another that is more focused.<br /><br />Try both threads and you won't be dissapointed...
1444710338|3.0|I bought book because many co-workers  have been  on the diet and have been successful.  I have not applied diet to my life.<br />I thought it would be straight foward information. Too much reading for me.
B00139XTG4|5.0|This book is not simple to read. One has to really dig in to start appreciating its insights, humor and very exact insights. Basically: one has to be skeptical (not gullible), even though our very nature tends that we accept \\"Tall Tales\\" (which are in our genes). Also that complex systems have redundancy built into them and that nature (and life) is a constant experiment.<br /><br />Thus \\"models\\" have only very limited usefullnes, and help (normally) in \\"dull\\" systems.<br /><br />This is the first time I've read an understandable explanation of fractal systems. And it also confirmed what I thought probable: Econometrics and economic systems analysis is either hot air or (as Nicholas Taleb puts it): Bull***t.<br /><br />Combine liberal dollops of humour, deep thought and you have an engrossing book.<br /><br />In the Second Edition there are great insghts into the 2008 Meltdown. This \\"crisis\\" doesn't fit in with a *real* Black Swan, since the people who thought about it saw it coming, but is a perfect example of how we need to totally rethink on how we manage risk in real systems. Basically, you can't predict risk, son you have to prepare yourself as best as possible (hedge your bets).<br /><br />Great reading!
B0010V5SW8|4.0|Again, Good movie but is a &#34;cartoon&#34; not real people. Sometimes can tell sometimes looks real. Watch it and see for yourself and make up your own mind

B000VUVGAW|4.0|Good movie. Not good at writing reviews so its a good movie and watch it for yourself and make up your own mind
1400067820|4.0|This is the first book I have read by Taleb. The man has brilliant ideas. He plays with a great triad throughout the book:<br />1. Fragility (things and people that fall prey to entropy)<br />2. Robustness (things and people that maintain the status quo in response to stress)<br />3. Anti-fragility (things and people that require volatility, disruption, and chaos to function best)<br /><br />If you are into psychology or the military, you can view post-traumatic stress disorder as fragility, resilience as robustness, and post-traumatic growth as anti-fragility.<br /><br />One of the strengths is the large number of domains that are covered. Expect a treatise that spans philosophy, economics, psychology, sociology, history, literature, etc. Taleb is excellent at creating short examples to transform abstract ideas into concrete, memorable tips for better living.<br /><br />I personally find his narcissism and need to create words to be entertaining. Taleb loves himself...a lot. He loves to let you know that he is smarter than every businessperson and economist on the planet. He loves to tell you that 100 years of social science are useless except for a few lone discoveries in cognitive science. He loves to tell you how he intimidates fans with his body builder physique. He loves to tell you how he is one of a handful of people that predicted the 2008 economic collapse (and everyone else who makes predictions is blatantly horrible). He loves to tell you that he wrote this 400+ page book without doing any library research. He loves to add tangential diatribes against people who wrote bad reviews of his book, challenged him in a symposium, or refused to accept his prior work as profound. And the list goes on. If you can treat Taleb as a playful, angry, hyper-intelligent character than you will gain access to a great array of ideas.<br /><br />A strength and weakness of the book is the sheer number of ideas. They are scattered. A bit of organization would have done wonders for making opinions/suggestions memorable. For instance, there is a great page in the first half of the book defending Stoicism and challenging the impractical ideas of Plato. Great stuff that is buried in thoughts about Scandinavian government, the stock market, airlines, the problem with academic professors, etc. The editor should have cut the book by 25% and this smaller version would have been more potent.<br /><br />That being said, for a 400 page theoretical book, this is an incredibly easy, enjoyable read. I will leave it to other reviewers to point out the substance. My aim is to let you know this a powerful, important book. Perhaps Taleb has earned his inflated ego. I know that I am grateful that there are bold writers like him out there.<br /><br />cheers,<br />Todds for making opinions/suggestions memorable.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|My daughter came along a little later in life than her siblings. I was 46 when she was born. She has made it to Middle School, now. Sometimes it feels awfully hard to find something that she and I really enjoy together. I want to watch my macho TV shows while she plays on the laptop.<br />\\"Brave\\" come out and I thought it looked cute. I bought it sight-unseen for my daughter. The movie arrived the night my daughter had planned a sleepover with a couple of friends. I popped the movie in and soon all three girls, myself, and my wife were enthralled.<br />The movie is clever with a message to be yourself but also be responsible. There are some really fun situations. Billy Connelly is, of course, great.<br />I will watch the movie, again and again. I hope it is a thing my daughter and I can share with hot chocolate, popcorn, and a lot of laughs.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I am not sure what I expected from this book but it has certainly been a surprise. Spanning a strange divergent time period with a number of loosely linked characters and storylines it takes a little time and effort to get through the first few sequences but after that it all starts to come together.<br /><br />I have found the book to entertaining and in my opinion extremely well written.
1401937519|4.0|Many of these stories are not that convincing, but this one is straight forward, not preaching anything, and it invites the reader to open up to a deeper awareness of the many dimensions of our lives.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|A little violent and surrealistic for children under 12 in my opinion. Well written and entertaining but the third leg drags a bit and it is a little too predictable for my taste but for kids...probably not.
0375507256|5.0|I consider myself to be pretty well read. I read bestsellers and classics, fiction and nonfiction, well-known and obscure. In all honesty, I picked up Cloud Atlas because I saw it was being made into a movie. I had never heard of it or David Mitchell. When I first started reading, it was a little difficult, because the author wrote using the vernacular of the period for which he was writing and the story didn't seem to be going anywhere. I stuck with it because Mitchell was such a good story-teller. The reading was enjoyable for its own sake. I'm glad I did. This book was amazing. There were two things I found impressive: First, the subtle way he tied the multiple stories together going forward then filled in the blanks on the backside--when you read you'll understand what I mean; the second was his ability to write in different styles and voices. If it tells you anything, once I finished Cloud Atlas I immediatley started another book from David Mitchell. That's very rare for me. I have a short attention span and like to bounce around between authors and subjects
B00A7CI82I|5.0|we have been bourne fans for a long time and wondered if this bourne legacy would measure up without matt damon whom we have always loved playing jason.  we saw this in the theatre first and loved it and thought jeremy did an outstanding performance.  he reminded us of 007 sometimes. funny being daniel craig's wife plays his friend in this movie.  hope we see more of them together and more bourne episodes. we are wondering if jason bourne will emerge at some time somewhere again ...?????
B009SQQRH2|4.0|We rented this from Amazon Instant Video on Saturday on a whim and my 8 year old daughter, my wife and I really enjoyed it.  It's well paced, never got boring.  The story is clever: a family of Santa's passing on the name sake from one generation to the next, with some friendly family rivalry over the generations, and the dorky brother who really knows the true meaning of Christmas and wants to save Christmas for one little girl.  The characters are a lot of fun, there are some pretty funny scenes, and a little tension that might have your kiddos wanting mom or dad close to snuggle with (but nothing too bad - though you might need to read the closing bits at the end to show that all of the reindeer make it home ok).<br /><br />For the three of us, definitely a good modern Christmas tale, something I'm sure we'll rent again in years to come.

I don't have time to read all 60+ reviews, but those that I did read did not answer an important question.  What if any are the differences in story content between the U.S. and U.K. versions?

0307463745|3.0|I really liked this book and found it a fast read.  However, now that several months have passed since reading it, I believe the \\"avoid planning\\" philosophy misses a crucial opportunity to align what the company is working on, and why, with employee goals, etc.  Getting everyone on the same page is essential to efficiency and is a foundation of good management.  In my experience, participation in planning exercises and hearing different perspectives on what we should be working on and why is worthwhile for everyone in the organization.  More communication is better than less communication!

B002PEP4SC|5.0|My first Richard Castle novel and I wasn't disappointed!!  I love a &#34;really good&#34; mystery and this book was just that good!!  The characters were so enjoyable and the banter between them was as enjoyable.  The only problem is, I enjoyed the author so much and he has written so many books, which one do I pick next??  Please, do yourself a favor and make this one a &#34;must read&#34;.....
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Wow what a movie. Great plot, action, actors and special effects. I can't wait to see more of this type of Incredible Hulk reflected on future movies. Black Widow and Hawkeye come out looking bad to the bone with no super powers. Thanos is a character that I have always wanted to see on the big screen - part 2 can't come any sooner. Fantastic Four - The Rise of The Silver Surfer ruined the Galactus character comic book readers deserve.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Just a great show. Just a great story on human perserverance and confrontation plus Zombies. Five stars for this great show
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I have always loved the Alien movies and this is no exception to the rule. Great story and the acting was very well performed.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The cinematography was good, but the storyline needs more development at the beginning.  I disagree with the selection of Theron and even more so in the case of Stewart.  Neither one was very convincing.  The end of the movie with Stewart's coronation was anti-climatic and her speech to rally the troops was weakly delivered.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I liked the way they approached the bad witch character. Snow White was well performed by the Twilight fox. I like the dark forest portrayal.
B00914JWSW|5.0|it is just mindboggling  to see a woman sing over decades without any loss whatsoever of her absolutely incredible voice
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I have always enjoyed Disney Movies - animated or not. This was well written and fun to watch, I would highly recommend.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thought this was a great opportunity to put myself in the shoes of those who have to do our dirty work, sacrifycing a lot of things for the good of their country!
B00AA7O22U|1.0|I love action movies but come on man. Kind of sad I had drink a lot of beer to somehow endure this movie.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This is a great game. That is undeniable. However, the only thing keeping my from giving it 5 stars is for several problems. Number one, which, for me, is pretty major, is I can't seem to start up the game without access to wi-fi. I can keep plqying, but whenever I start it up, it says &quot;Dungeon Hunter 3 has stopped&quot;. Another problem is in the various batlefields. Occasionaly, although not the often, I can't move on to the next wave, even though I killed every enemy. The third and final glitch is that I can't actually wear the various hats. (I only tested this with Trickster.) However, if you have the space, and are willing to put up with the bugs/wi-fi only problems, then this is a fantastic game.<br />(Any and all glitches were tested on a Kindle Fire HD.They are not guaranted to occur on a other device.)
B009HEJXFS|4.0|A lot better than the 2nd one, but the original was fresh, so hard to compare to it. Good story and plot. Enjoyed watching it.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Was not sure I would like this series because of the graphic nature but I can get past the gorey stuff because of all the warmth and humor interjected into the characters.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter and son watched this movie in a friend's house.  They want me to rent this movie and convinced me to watch with them.  I fall in love with this move too.  I will buy the Blue Ray/DVD/Digital copy version when it becomes available.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|A pretty entertaining spin on one of our past presidents, i enjoyed the story, the action was thrilling, good old Lincoln more to him then i believed. :)
B009A87X80|2.0|I'm a jazz DJ, huge lover of great singers, especially Eva.  I have her entire non-bootleg catalog and have listened to every tune many times over the years. I made my own Best of Eva compilation last year.  Though they call \\"Songbird\\" a compilation, it really isn't what I'd call a Best Of, more like a sampler. Eva badly needed a Best of compilation that does her justice. Sure, it's all subjective, but I am truly shocked by what's included here and what's not. No \\"Wayfaring Stranger,\\" unbelievable! And possibly her best overall album, \\"Live At Blues Alley,\\" is WAY under-represented here.  I love all the genres Eva covers equally well, no prejudices at all. I think this alleged Best Of Eva disc is a huge disappointment. I think first time Eva buyers would get the most banging great Eva music for the buck by purchasing \\"Songbird\\" and \\"Live At Blues Alley\\" and go from there if you want to dig deeper.  But her other albums are uneven compared to the 2 I just mentioned, though there are fine moments there, as well.  Or maybe you could talk me into making you a copy of my 2-disc Best Of Eva if you're nice!  Eva really grabs your heart and soul, doesn't she? Wish you could hear the phone calls I got during my jazz shows when listeners heard Eva the first time in my shows.  Just like what happened at the BBC and Nightline.  I cannot recommend this disc because it should have been SO much better.  Here's the track listing, in sequence, for my own 2-disc compilation \\"Best Of Eva,\\" compiled from all her non-bootleg discs: DISC 1 1.Wayfaring Stranger 2.Honeysuckle Rose 3.I Can Only Be Me 4.I Could Have Told You So 5.At Last 6.Take Me To The River 7.Natural Woman 8.Dark End Of The Street 9.Stormy Monday 10.I'll Go Crazy 11.Blue Skies 12.I Wish I Was A Single Girl Again 13.Let The Good Times Roll 14.Songbird 15.Fever 16.Getting Out 17.Wade In The Water 18.You've Changed 19.Hallelujah, I Love Him So 20.Tennessee Waltz 21.Somewhere -- DISC 2: 1.Fine & Mellow 2. Easy Street Dream 3.Over The Rainbow 4.Penny To My Name 5.Cheek To Cheek 6.Natural Woman (Traditional) 7.Ain't Doin' Too Bad 8.Fields Of Gold 9.Blues In The Night 10.Little Children 11.Won't Be Long 12.Danny Boy 13.Chain Of Fools 14.San Francisco Bay Blues 15.Drowning In The Sea Of Love 16.God Bless The Child 17.People Get Ready 18.Oh, Had I A Golden Thread 19.How Can I Keep From Singing?  If I were to make a 1-disc \\"Best Of Eva,\\" it would contain the following tunes, though, since I haven't timed it out, this many tunes may not fit on one disc, and the sequence would vary some. 1.Wayfaring Stranger 2.Dark End Of The Street 3.I'll Go Crazy 4.Blue Skies 5.I Wish I Was A Single Girl Again 6.Let The Good Times Roll 7.Getting Out 8.Wade In The Water 9.Hallelujah, I Love Him So 10.Somewhere 11.Fine & Mellow 12.Over The Rainbow 13.Cheek To Cheek 14.Ain't Doin' Too Bad 15.Blues In The Night 16.Little Children 17.Won't Be Long 18.Chain Of Fools 19.San Francisco Bay Blues 20.Drowning In The Sea Of Love 21.God Bless The Child 22.Oh, Had I A Golden Thread 23.How Can I Keep From Singing.

B009GEAPYW|5.0|A must watch for batman fans! i enjoyed it so much i watched it three times and this batman is no joke he is tough, he is brave and he has never met anyone he can't outwit.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I had seen the PBS program of this recording,which was great, so I ordered this CD which was even better because I could hear the instruments even better. Just when you think you know all there is to know about Sir Paul, you find out that he isn't even thinking about slowing down. The program on PBS (which is available on DVD) shows why he chose the musicians and who they are (Diana Krall with her group, Stevie Wonder and Eric Clapton, to name a few, plus an entire string orchestra), the particular songs and what they mean to him, showed the insides of McCartney. He didn't do the American standards a better way, just a fantastic different way. This CD shows that McCartney is like Tony Bennett in that, the older he gets, the better he is.
B00756GKBA|5.0|It's a little weird thing to be reviewing Madonna's album. I am beyond average fan and anyone like that will just be grateful that Madonna puts record out. Madonna's albums were always some kind of staple or measure-stick in pop music where all other current top 40 hits were spinning around. For years Madonna has been changing her sound very successfully as an artist. She kept delivering great albums for her fans, one after another. In this world of new, innovated, over-produced MUSIC, Madonna still manages to deliver an out-standing album. She is still Queen of PoP and no other artist comes anywhere close to her. Public life of this super-famous megastar has its ups and downs but the MUSIC is still undeniable.<br /><br />By now album has been out for a 9-10 months and I keep going back and forth from it. I liked it from the very first listen but it was a lot to take in. Madonna's ALL albums have their own flow and they all seem to have some kind of concept. In that respect, MDNA is no different. I listened to album a lot and I don't find any weak spots. \\"Gang Bang\\", \\"Some Girls\\" and \\"Love Spent\\" are HIGH points of this album. These three songs are so different from each other, lyrically and sound-wise. I'd say that \\"Gang Bang\\" is the ultimate highlight. It's un-like anything else Madonna has done in the past. It has too many people credited for it. But it comes down to Madonna in the end and somehow it's all her. \\"Some Girls\\" to me is the greatest sounding song here - lyrics are really dark, but if you blast this one really loud, it will be very up-lifting. I love that contrast. \\"Love Spent\\" is just a great pop creation. \\"I'm Addicted\\" and \\"Falling Free\\" are also great songs - I love both. Singles \\"Give Me All Your Luvin' \\", \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" and \\"Turn Up The Radio\\" are radio friendly and are SOLID singles. Classic Madonna moment is \\"Masterpiece\\". I wish that sometime in the future Madonna would make whole album of songs like that. It seems effortless and Madonna shows her softer side. To me this is ultimate stand-out but I look at it like W. E. soundtrack, rather than part of MDNA. It works but in my mind is attached to the film. \\"Superstar\\", \\"I Don't Give A\\" and \\"I'm A Sinner\\" are also solid songs.<br /><br />Over-all MDNA is another great album by Madonna. Normally I wouldn't bother giving Madonna extra compliments, but this time I was really irritated by severe criticism. I really can't see why. Also, some people that posted positive reviews were just saying that in-spite of negative reviews. MDNA is very dark. I think that`s what separates MDNA from all other Madonna`s albums and makes people un-comfortable. Most songs are about heartbreak and some kind of picking yourself up from the \\"bottom\\". It really shows some dark emotions and anger. But it still gives some kind of solution to it all. Maybe next Madonna album will be sunny-happy album, but for now MDNA does its job as expression of human dark side. It's still authentic and \\"envelope pushing\\" as Madonna likes to say ...ows her softer side. To me this is ultimate stand-out but I look at it like W. E. soundtrack, rather than part of MDNA.

B0086700CM|4.0|love this game but only gave it four stars Cu's its really glittchy.wish there were some instructions for the objectevis as well.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Full of extras including deleted scenes plus interviews.  The story on the USS Indy really strikes a cord. Transfer is amazing.  One of the best Blu-rays of 2012.  You realize how darn challenging making this movie really was for everyone involved.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Beyond the title, pretty much all I knew about Summer Wars before watching it was that it's by the same director as The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.  The cover showed a cast that appeared to be of the fantastical sort and led by an anthropomorphic rabbit.  Based on this limited information (and determined not to gather more since I enjoy going into movies \\"blind\\"), I put off watching this until I was in the mood for what I thought be an offbeat magical adventure.<br /><br />I was way off track.  Summer Wars not only isn't what I expected, but is a refreshingly unique, equal blend of abstract elements with those grounded in reality.  The animation is wonderful, both in the subdued qualities of Natsuki's countryside home and the stark vibrancy of Oz.<br /><br />I'm going to avoid any plot details or summary for the sake of anyone who'd like to watch Summer Wars unfold with the same curiosity and wonder I did (and others can simply read the product description).  Simply put: it's a fun, multi-layered, character driven movie.<br /><br />While comparisons to The Girl Who Leapt Through Time would be unfair since the movies are so different in pace, scope and feel, Summer Wars achieves the same level of quality and both are practically \\"must-watch\\" for any fan of anime.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004RL9T50|5.0|Good choice for a family movie night. The kids (7 and 2yrs) loved it and it even kept us adults entertained throughout!
B005DVJQHY|2.0|I downloaded several Master Key System ebooks. This one DEFINATELY isn't complete. It's more put together quickly with concern of making the author money, then presenting original text with good easy formatting. This edition doesn't fit either of the two. I went with another edition on amazon and happy.
0891419063|5.0|Best war book ever written.  I had just finished the Manchester trilogy on Churchill--to read this was a stark contrast to the political machinations during WW2.  And I say that knowing well that Churchill was no slouch when it came to combat and war-time danger.  I am interested to read the lesser known Sledge book about his experiences after the war.
B007Y6DUHI|4.0|I downloaded several versions of Master Key System. This one DEFINATELY is the real deal I'd trust and read. 4 stars because formatting can be much better. Feels like no care was taken to have proper paragraph spaces.  End of the day what matters is the content. And it gets 5/5 for that.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|Good price, good quality, strong fashion design, looks like classic and sport as well. It has mechanism from the left side for left-handers.
B009GESJH2|3.0|It's OK. I was a little disappointed. I really like his last CD and was hoping this one would have been just as good but I won't be listening to it much nor recommending it.
B002ZG976U|4.0|HUGE fan of this movie! Didn't know it was for sale until I was looking for other movies. MUST BUY
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Acurate reproduction of the classic arcade game. Looks great, plays great. I find myself playing it multiple times a day. Worth the download.
B007NMN2US|5.0|Show your support for your favorite superhero and your favorite toy!  What better way than through superhero Legos! Perfect size for your keychain or just to add to a collection on the wall.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|played all day with my son would be better if captions were they had sound options for kids.Other than that it gets a thumbs up
B009VB97EY|3.0|Fairly entertaining. With all the hype I thought it would be better than it was. Magic Mike wasn't very magical.
B005SZAEYO|1.0|Great acting, but terrible story...<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />A few examples of why this show sucks...<br /><br />How do you have sex with a fully latexed man and not question who he is?  The kid who is the latex man has a much different body type than her husband.  Her husband is tall and muscular.  This teenage kid is skinny and looks shorter.  All those years of sleeping with her husband and she can't tell?<br /><br />How does a ghost impregnate a human being?  Not only did he have sex with the mom, but he took her daughter's virginity as well.<br /><br />I had to laugh when the one armed burnt guy started digging a grave.  How absurd is that?<br /><br />Overall, I really hate all the characters, especially the family.  We got a sex crazed husband who is weak and hardly does the right thing.  We got a wife who is weaker and just plain stupid.  How do you not know what your daughter is up to? She's wishy washy, one day she wants to keep the house, another day she wants to sale.  She doesn't think it's strange that people just show up at her house at anytime of the day.  We also have a daughter who is angry at the world and is in love with a ghost.  How the heck do you fall in love with a ghost who is a murderer, and she knows!!  Aren't dead people supposed to be \\"cold\\"?<br /><br />I thought only the people who died at the house can become half ghosts and half living, I guess.  How did those teenagers become ghosts when they died in the library?<br /><br />Awful TV...I'll stick with The Walking Dead.
B0002U4A9K|4.0|One of Jackman's best. He personifies a real action movie hero in this one. It's amazing what one can do to try and kill the king of all vampires.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this author's series of Greek myth based stories. The characters are great and the portrayal of the Gods is always interesting.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I thought the first one was original, upbeat, and fancy ... but this one took it to a whole new level. :) &#34;Resident Evil: Damnation&#34; is the little brother that the video game series should've had. If you took the love of the whole zombie genre and the love of action horror in general, then this movie would be its love child. If this game was in jail for committing a serious crime, the other video game inmates would be its ... well, you know. :) Gotta keep it classy for the massy. Anyway, now back to your regularly scheduled programming: &#34;Resident Evil: Damnation&#34; came out at the right time when the gapping in the franchise was widening. Luckily we have the home and theatrical movies to contend with.<br />Go get this film. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Use it almost every day. It is great on my tablet. Ease of use and fun to play.  Love it.
B004QL7K6Q|3.0|I (wander) wonder where the talent went? I don't know. Jennifer Aniston could have chosen a better way to express how sad she is when she makes a movie like this. Rudd too. Honestly, I haven't even watched it yet but from what I hear it's not the role for either Aniston or Rudd to be in. Especially together. Now if it was Aniston and Jack Black, of Rudd and Cameron Diaz, then I might feel differently about it. I think there was supposed to be a scene that was cut out with Aniston and another girl having sex when Rudd's character came in the room with the door closed but I forgot who it was supposed to be with. I'm not sure. Maybe I have to watch the movie to make sure (maybe it's in the deleted scenes section (I hope)). :) Anyway, good luck next time Jennifer and Paul. the sequel may be better. Or not.  I say not. Let's go with that, shall we.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|If you like the Muppets and like Christmas then this is the best mix for you! I would look into the Muppet Family Christmas too!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Very enjoyable movie! Keeps your attention! At times a little gory, but great gangster type flick. Well worth the bucks.
B00336C3EY|3.0|It is an okay movie, I think. It is an okay movie, I think. It is an okay movie, I think.
B007I2BYX0|4.0|Too bad there's only 3 new songs in this EP. Can't stop listenning to it ! I highly recommend it.
B000T433CO|5.0|Watching the characters grow stronger as they experience heart break and then new love is just very heart warming for me. Definitely a feel good film!
B007R21JJK|3.0|It's like pulling teeth getting a stable linux network driver for this motherboard otherwise it's solid.<br /><br />Maybe with the new experimental kernel the driver might work, until then stuck with windows8
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This CD is all over the place. The guitar is fantastic and Gary can sing as well. I can listen to the whole thing.
B009IQG5LK|3.0|Since so many aren't reviewing the film, using Amazon as a platform/soapbox, I won't feel guilty for doing the same.  DICK TRACY was right at the top of my to see list in 1990.  My mother never let us have more than one theatre experience (if we were even allowed that due to our strapped finances) per year, and 1990 had a lot of interesting movies coming out.  Forget the hindsight.  Just forget about knowing what we know now.  Never mind that you know that almost 10 out of 10 films coming out by the big studios that summer were complete garbage.  Just think what we had coming coming down the pike and how exciting that would have been to an unsuspecting populace (following on the heels of the summer of '89 that delivered admittedly weak but still curiously satisfying - AND blockbuster - titles like Batman, Ghostbusters 2, Indy 3, the Little Mermaid, Karate Kid 3 and whatever else).  This time in 1990, also following a GREAT spring time with Hunt for Red October, Miami Blues, Pretty Woman and the first TMNT film, we had Total Recall, Goodfellas, Die Hard 2, Back to the Future 3, Cry Baby, GHOST, Days of Thunder, Bird on a Wire, Another 48hrs, Gremlins 2, Young Guns 2, Darkman, Navy Seals, Neverending Story 2, Tremors, Revenge, Quick Change, Grifters, Q&A, Pump Up the Volume, The Two Jakes (I'm a supporter), Millers Crossing, After Dark My Sweet, Desperate Hours, King of New York, and on.  (Let me revise my previous comments...8 of 10 sucked, not 10 of 10, apologies.)<br /><br />  Guess what I saw.  Dick f'n Tracy.<br /><br />  I just caught it on HBO and I actually dug it.  But at the time, it was more than I could handle at 12yrs old.  It wasn't a kid's movie.  It was kind of an art house thing.  Depressing for a kid.  BORING.  And left me shamefaced with a lot of DT swag I suddenly felt alienated by.  A lesson on materialism for me, haha.<br /><br />  Anyway.  All these years later, Warren Beatty was at some sort of screening of the film maybe like four years ago.He admitted he shot the movie to be a HARD PG-13, if not an R.  Bloody violence.  Disney made him cut it, I assume, when it sought to imitate the Batman over saturation thing (which I loved...it was like a new holiday except for a movie).  It just wasn't the right one for kids.  And it totally gutted the movie, I think.<br /><br />My point is this.  At that time, Beatty said he had always been interested in taking advantage of the DVD wave and digging BACK into the old footage and assembling the cut he had always intended.  Making it DARK, like the comics were (I guess...I don't know them...apparently the comics were find with violence and portrayed brutal crime - so I hear).  Obviously Beatty had NOT done that.  And THAT is my point.  The reason we are not flooded with Dick Tracy discs is because there is nobody going to bat for the movie.  There are no voices in power who are pushing for it.  So unless Beatty gets nostalgic for his Madonna days, don't hold your breath for the LOST masterpiece or even the simplest special feature.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I started watching this one afternoon and could not stop. The sound is fantastic and these guys are as tight as ever. These old men can blow away half the bands today.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|A bit slow for me but I ordered it for my wife; she and other's in my family have always given the original with Jimmy Stweart and Donna Reed RAVE REVIEWS.......I prefer the colorized updated (new actors) version and DID watch the colorized version...thus 5 STARS +<br /><br />Yes, the story line is old but the values will always be important; anyone in WASHINGTON, D.C. listening?????
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I have liked this cover on Amazon for a long time, but only recently purchased it. I love it. It's beautiful, feels solid and well made, and the straps seems to hold my Kindle Fire firmly in place. If you're looking for heavy duty protection though, you'll want something else. I've had cases that offered more protection and found the lack of usability to be annoying after using them for a period of time. For my needs, it is exactly what I've been looking for and I can't emphasize enough how much I adore the look of it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|amazing just amazing cant say much more its just fabulous if it costed 500000$i would get it I love this game and always will
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King never disappoints! Amazing detail that invokes interest in the actual event and circumstances surrounding Kennedy's assassination. Add in an unexpected love story, suspense and characters you feel as if you know, and we have a story that grabs the reader from page 1. This was one of those books that I wished could go on forever. I actually started reading slower at the end--in a feeble attempt to make it last longer! Thanks again S.K. for another great one!
B007SGM084|5.0|Ohhhh fifty fifty fifty!!!! All I was thinking, and talking... was about Christian Grey! I really enjoy reading theses 3 books...they were VERY addicting, I just can't stop reading!!! At the end, I feel like I was a part of the book, like they were familly to me...like it was real!
B002ZG974M|4.0|I had my college students, who are taking a course in Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE), watch the DVD and then answer five questions on the film.  From what I'm reading in their responses, it made a real impression on them and I highly recommend it for showing to ECSE majors!  Also, I didn't want it to end, so that's a good sign too!
B00846REIS|5.0|I already read Fifty Shades of Gey... so at the beginning I was... oh my god, it's really a copy of Fifty! Eva is Ana, Gideon is Christian. I really love the story, I can't wait for the third one!!! For everyone that enjoy fifty... this is the ONE too read!!!!
B009SQQRH2|5.0|This movie was so well done ~ cute story, excellent characters, and a great ending. The whole family loved it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Where is the third one?!!!! I just can't wait!!!! This book is full of things that's you don't expect. A really nice story... addicting, like fifty shades. There's so much resemblance in the story, but we love it...!!!
B009SQQRH2|4.0|This was a good Christmas movie for the kids. Always a lesson to be learned even while having a good time.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I am very pleased with my LifeProff Case.  I recommend it to anyone looking for good protection for their phone.
0876391277|5.0|This book is a good fit for saxophone players, composers and arrangers, it explores the wide sound palette that is usually left out of the conventional text books.<br />From a teaching stand point, every topic is explained in a very clear manner also, various audio examples are shown in the useful CD, where you can listen and also play-along on pre recorded music.<br />As a saxophone player /teacher I encourage everyone to check out this book because it is a great vehicle to improve your knowledge and expression on the instrument.
B007704HO6|5.0|Really lovely story. You will read this in a weekend. I found it really enjoyable. Happy to recommend this book.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The DVD arrived on time, and the price was great. I'm very happy with the quality of service that was provided.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Its really cool to see all the heroes in one movie. They need to follow up with another wild sequel.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|Pete Sandoval the driving force behind Morbid Angel refused to have anything to do with this album and rightly so. After almost a decade playing without Dave Vincent, he finally returns to the band and this is the watered-down techno junk that they release as a new album? The fans have been cheated out of a decent record. Yes, there are 2 or 3 good songs on this album but the rest of the material on this record is just plain horse dung to say the least. If Morbid Angel wants to experiment with different styles of music that's fine go play that music under a different band name. Don't tarnish the Morbid Angel name and legacy putting out garbage like this. Pete Sandoval was so embarrassed with the material on this record that he declined to be part of the recording sessions and left to go play real deathmetal. I dont blame him. Hopefully Trey Azagaboth will wake up and realize that for the next Morbid Angel album they need to get back to the basics and loose the dance beats and techno nonsense because that stuff does not belong on a deathmetal release.
B008YMHORI|5.0|I love the music and chemistry between players. I am impressed with sensitivity and understanding of the music. Helen Grimaud is playing like she plaid when she yang again.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thought this book was very intriguing, I could'nt figure out the plot until the very end. I read a lot and can usually see where the story is going, but I did'nt with this one. I think it is one of Grishams better stories, like the Firm.
B00190KZUU|5.0|I could so relate to this movie when it came out.  I had lost my Dad a few years earlier, he died of a stroke.  I was going through an extremely hard time in my life.  An all time low, with absolutely no support whatever.  I won't dwell on that, but I will say that this movie brought me to tears, and no other movie has ever done that.  I feel the need to watch it every now and again.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Smiling's my favorite! A must have movie for Christmas. Will Ferrell is hilarious and Zoey Deschanel is just so  adorable!
B008J040RC|5.0|This album leaves a few of my personal favorites off, but makes up for it with the added bonus live tracks. They played the majority of these songs on the Mayhem tour this past year. Best live show ever!
0307346617|4.0|This was my first Zombie book and I was pleasantly surprised.  Not sure how they will make the movie but the book was pretty good.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i loved it.easy to use and understand. Great app. I reccomend it to everyone. Awesome experience. everyone should try this.
B007SY3CEW|2.0|I love this app I got the free version and played it on my galaxy s3 and loved it.  I bought the full version and downloaded it to my kindle fire a dam so disappointed.  any song that requires u to play a 3 note chord ( which is any song over the easy level) will only register 2 of the 3 notes pushed.  so during game play you cant get high scores or even have the song sound good.  totally ruins the game play.  if this app worked as good on the fire as it did on my smart phone id give it 5 starts but because of this glitch pass on this for the kindle fire
B009FRG8IW|5.0|buy the deluxe version, the 10 extra tracks are definitely worth it! Amazon has better deals over Google Play and iTunes so don't think it twice and buy this record!! Swedish House Mafia makes me happy while working out!!
0525478817|5.0|I pre-ordered a signed copy and loved it. this book is amazing i highly recommend it! all of John Greens books are great
0875847706|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect as I heard about this book from a friend. It lead me through a path of discovery that I will revisit, often. I believe rule number 6 can solve many of our problems. Thank you, Zanders.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|ponyfection /)(\ Hoofup every barony! I loved the voicing any graphics!  this game is perfect for those who don't like the idle wait for the timer to get to zero (mini games)
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|It will not add my city at all, I even tried other bigger cities and it will not add them.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Many people bought the PSP Vita on Black Friday that came with AC Liberation.  I was one of those.  But instead of buying solely for those games, I was aiming at P4G.  I have finished P4 on my PS3 in PS2 mode years ago, but the way this JRPG plays out pushed me to play it again to see some of the upgrades.<br /><br />After about 12 hours of playing, I'm still nowhere close to the end.  If i remember correctly i spent around 120 or so on the PS2 version.  Possibly more.  The story itself is engaging, the new characters make the game feel a bit more polished and the world \\"fuller\\".  And the epic fights are still fantastic.<br /><br />In terms of using the Vita, i've gotta say the port is fantastic.  The controls are smoother than on ps2 though i do sometimes think i run to fast and mess up on sneak attacks.  The square button to port around is great.  The environment just looks fantastic and makes you believe you're truly in a game that FF7 wishes it could be.<br /><br />All in all, an easy 5*.
0805092447|5.0|My kids love this book. They will read it or ask me to read it over and over again every day. It was my son's favorite book from about 1 up and is my daughter's favorite book now at 18 months. My nanny's son, who is roughly the same age as my daughter, liked it so much we got him a copy too! This is my second time buying this book for my kids because they read it so much it fell apart.
0786962984|4.0|This is a mass market game that is slightly better than many roll and move mass market games (you don't even roll to move!) It's cheap, it has lots of D&D theme, and plays quickly. This isn't going to get play in your gaming group but could be a fun romp with younger kids who can handle the vagrancies of dice-based combat.  Yes, this is a remake of the classic from the early 80's if you're into nostalgia.
0071766588|5.0|Well packed, no damage. Price is cheap and the book is great. I recommend this book for new TOEFL tester.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Works well and smoothly. the keys are easy to use - I never had a problem with hitting the wrong key accidentally (which has happened on other apps) . Plus it's free - the adds were not distracting,  but I might still buy the app.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|I bough this for my wife.<br />Certainly not my cup of tea.<br />She enjoys a wide variety of music and she likes the quality of this CD.
B008VNIBFO|5.0|This is in my top 5 movies of all time.  The blu ray edition is stunning.  I already own copies of this film, but I just had to have it in this version.  Some of the extras are the same ones available on the last DVD version.  The other extras are fantastic.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|A damn fine story that virtually anyone can relate too, even if you think you know Clint Eastwood, this movie will amaze you!
B009LDD54K|4.0|This season of Boardwalk - in which Jimmy's warning comes back to haunt him - recounts a very bad year for Nucky while also developing the organized crime mythology of the time.<br /><br />After Margaret's stunt at the end of Season 2, the Thompson's marriage goes on the rocks, with both eventually guilty of extramarital affairs, Nucky indulging first and most blatantly and Margaret's situation undoubtedly complicated by her daughter's polio diagnosis adding another hurdle to her easily leaving Nucky.  That is soon the least of Nucky's problems, however, with deranged Gyp Rosetti - played with scenery chewing relish by Bobby Cannavale - making a play for AC and sending Nucky into a battle for not only his power, but his life.<br /><br />The series begins the process of developing historical figures like Meyer Lansky, Al Capone (Stephen Graham in a performance that has some fans making noises about wanting him to headline a series about Capone's Eliot Ness years after Boardwalk is over) and Charles Luciano (not so lucky yet) into the legendary figures that many people have at least a passing knowledge of.  It also does equally well with it's fictional characters, notably Michael Kenneth Williams' winning Chalky White and Gretchen Mol's increasingly disturbing Gillian Darmody.  Van Alden takes a bit of a backburner, but finds himself in the most deliciously ironic situation of the entire cast when he is around.  The heart of the series, however, is undoubtedly Jack Huston's magnificent Richard Harrow, who's the closest thing the story has to a hero in a world where everyone's morally ambiguous.  Mourning the loss of his dear friends the Darmodys, Richard couldn't care two cents for the gangland wars going down, but is rather focused on saving his friends' son, Tommy, from the influence of his psycho Grandma.  With the purest motive of any character in the story, it's Richard who we're rooting for all the way.  It says something about the twisted world of Boardwalk that the thing we most desperately want to see this season is a sniper getting custody of a little boy from his last remaining blood relative.<br /><br />We also get a look at social issues such as the treatment of minorities as seen through the glass ceiling Chalky faces, what life was like for women before legal birth control (let alone abortions), and even - in some surprisingly heartbreaking scenes involving Capone and his little boy - the lack of resources for parents of special needs children.  The 20's might look fun on paper, but they probably still weren't a great time to live in for alot of people.<br /><br />Finally, of course, there's Nucky himself, who this season finds himself at his most brutal but also doing some real self-assesment when he sees who stands by him at his lowest ebb.<br /><br />Those who have been following Boardwalk Empire will find no reason to stop now.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I got this free as app of the day and enjoyed it a lot.  Played on Kindle Fire (older model).  Definately worth the 99&cent; it costs now.  Enjoyed so much I bought Grisly Manor made by the same folks; but didn't like it as much.  They are definately improving as they develop and I will buy the next one they come out with.  (Note:  saw lots of complaints about not working on the HD kindles; so if that is your device you may want to steer clear )
B0009DBXXG|5.0|It was wonderful to see Bernstein working with the performers to produce this recording.  What a musical genius.  The candid interactions are fascinating.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for something new to read and picked this after reading some of the reviews. I could hardly put it down. Excellent read, suspense,drama, romance, sci fi all in one book. Don't pass this one up.
B005T87QCI|5.0|real steel hd  is a very fun game where you are a robot and you face an oppontent robot great job jumpgames pvt. ltd
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Julianne was wonderful ... the rest were SO fake that it was funny.  Loved the music from my era ... listened to the movie but did not watch.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|First I appreciated the openness of this family to talk about their feelings good and bad as much as they did. The psychological impact of war and the situations faced at various times. There was no way to turn it off and in a firefight you continue to stuff it down until it was over. The training that was endless, preparing for this and for that. It kept the soldier's mind busy, but even when not in a war zone, it was still dangerous.<br />The wife's imagination could run wild. The not knowing can be torture. How she was able to control her thoughts was phenomenal. Chris gave real insight to how the Seals worked with other branches of the military. The team work and respect that he had for other soldiers was very uplifting. The discussion of weapons was extremely good. It was a good read and took about two days.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|So, I'm a huge superhero fan, and Batman is right up my alley. His story is a little bit darker than most, but Christian Bale makes an excellent performance of the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. I had not really heard of the villan in this story before I had seen the movie however. But the story is excellent. Would definitely recommend this dvd.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|O the tension! The sexual tension between the protagonists! Was handled very well. The story was told from the perspectives of both the hero and heroine. I found the book to be the most delicious of all treats with memorable, likable, relatable and quite normal characters and a story line that does not border on melodrama but was handled very tastefully.<br /><br />References were made about the tragedy in their lives which shaped the characters behaviour but I was glad that the author didn't dwell on it. Both characters were your everyday people, quite sensible, who handled their emotions maturely. I fell in love with the book because the story line was very sweet and it avoided all the excesses that make books difficult to read. A five star in my opinion and definitely a keeper.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|So, I'm definitely a twihard! However, this movie has something to offer for people that aren't necessarily just into the Twilight series. The movie has romance, and definitely more action than previous twilight movies. Lol, I'm definitely Team Edward, but sometimes Jacob shirtless makes me doubt my decision lol.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read every single book she has written, the only thing bad about them is I never want to put them down, but then I never want them to end...
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight is an excellence movie. Especially enjoyed Heath Ledger, he was an amazing actor. I do have to say, however, that his joker role is a bit dark. There are times when I want to turn my head, but I just don't really like violent scenes to begin with. Aside from that, action at every turn and definitely suspense. Would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an awesome game it very fun. So if you like tricky games you should get it. Believe me it's. fun
B0044XV3R8|5.0|The special effects in the movie are absolutely stunning James Cameron brings to life this incredible world and Avatar has all the ingredients for an awesome movie: Romance, adventure, drama, action, and some funny scenes. Would definitely rate this movie as a MUST SEE!
B00846REIS|4.0|Very good book but too similar to fifty shades of gray. I still enjoyed it though and will be reading the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|exciting and rivitting! couldn't put it down. Wished the ending was happier but it was the perfect one for this novel.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was expecting more sci-fi since this is a sci-fi best seller, but it's lacking robots, spaceships and other outlandish technology.  A great read regardless, totally addicting. I'll be downloading the next book in the series now, thanks Howey :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Very enjoyable way to pass the time. I had fun discovering each new level and smiled often at the way the Star Wars characters were portrayed. Fun for kids and adults
030746363X|5.0|I am overweight.  No I am fat.  To lose weight I have had a gastric by-pass and tried many different routines.  The 4 hour body is not a miracle cure, it is not a panacea.  It is highly motivating and I find that following a few of its principles during my forget it I am going to eat like a horse periods I can reduce the damage I do to my weight loss.<br /><br />I think there are a couple of key elements that will make this book better:<br /><br />1) Never forget the 20/80 rule.  For those of us who are not trying to get under 2% body fat but are trying to get down to a manageable weight and who have the will power of a famished dog looking a bowl of bacon it is our key to success.  When I fall off the health nut wagon I can still eat a high protein breakfast, avoid carbs especially in the mornings, and still maintain a stable weight.  Little or no change during bad boy times is a good change for those of us who have played with diets a lot.<br /><br />2) The day off is a blessing but for those in my category it is often stretched too easily so I refer you to number 1.  If you follow the 20% rules even on cheat days or weeks [just being honest here] then you minimize the overall damage.<br /><br />3) The little tricks that yield big results are my starting and focal points in the book.  I read the entire book but many chapters don't currently pertain to my situation and probably never will.  Many of them however are perfect for people like me.  Get 80% of the benefit with 20% of the max effort and then, as you feel healthier add to it.<br /><br />Since I have been working with this diet when I am faithful my weight loss and body change is pretty impressive averaging 4-6 lbs per week and a nice reduction in waist and butt inches with a slight increase in arm and thigh inches.  During 3 months of non-adherence aside from protein breakfasts I gained back only 5 of the 25 lbs I had lost (1 month on and 3 months off and still down 20lbs).  This also coincided with a return to a fairly sedentary lifestyle.<br /><br />Every few months I get my mojo back and want to start losing weight again (I love cold weather it actually motivates me) and when that happens I can easily kick in more aspects of the four hour body to take advantage and lose a little more.<br /><br />So don't be discouraged by his discussion of getting the last couple of % off.  If you really analyze the 20/80 rules and apply his book accordingly it is a tome of encouragement to us less than motivated, short cut seeking, beautiful on the inside people too.<br /><br />Read the book, don't put yourself in a category you don't fit.  If you are overweight like me focus on the weight loss and body sculpting and just read the other parts to laugh at what a nut case the author is.  There is so much encouragement to get the most from the least and that is the gold mined from this book.  The rest may be very useful and good advice but for most of us the focus on the core message is what is truly revolutionary from what we have been taught.  More is not better, most return on investment is.<br /><br />One last comment.  The kettlebell swing is a killer.  He says 10-15 minutes twice a week, I applied the 20% rule my first time and got in about 3 minutes and two days on disability as my muscles recovered.  I am looking forward to building up to a better workout but don't let the light weight fool you when you first start.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Super fast shipping. And The Weeknd is even more amazing! Great great music! I've been a fan of him when he had less than 300 likes on Facebook. I'm a true original fan. And still till this day i can listen to all these songs and not get tired of them! LOVE him :D
B003O86FMW|5.0|You won't be able to put this one down either. I can't wait to see how is all going to end
B000059GEH|5.0|Can't believe how beautiful Marilyn is. Especially in this movie. The outfits, the way they talk, and how ladies used to be! Amazing movie!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|an excellent movie, loved by all fans of firefly;  we only wish there were more episodes, and additional movies like it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is such a nifty app.... very helpful.... we installed on all of our kindles!! I highly recommend this app to all users.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|many, many viewings of this to come. firefly fans just wish that there were many more episodes that we could watch, over and over again.
B000BYA4JM|5.0|This has always been my favorite movie! My daugthers lovedthe movie as well :)<br />Great for a family to watch together,
030759565X|5.0|I am a great fan of the blog and could hardly wait to support the author and her wonderful ideas. Thanks so much for the lovely cookbook and blog.
B008VKNEJU|5.0|I started following her since this summer and I don't regret it. Her CD is well done. I love the production and lyrics to the songs. She's going to be performing in DC in January which I will be getting tickets for her. I even won over two more fans. If there was a combination of her to compare her to, it would be a cross of Sade and Adele. That is good company to be with if I should say so myself. You can't go wrong with this CD.
0786838655|4.0|Don't Stop Reading my Review!<br /><br /> Are you looking for a book that will capture your attention? Then I highly recommend the book, The Lightning Thief.  In this book, Percy Jackson is offered a quest to save the world from a huge war of the gods.  Along the way Percy finds out what matters the most.<br /> First and foremost, you should read this book because it can help you visualize what's going on.  In this book, there was this hairy thing with horns and cruel black eyes.  That helped me visualize what that thing was.  Second of all, you should read this book because it can help you make connections.  In this book it said how Percy ruined a bus.  I made the connection to the movie, I Am Number 4.  Lastly, you should read this book because it will make you crack up all day and night. In this book, Nancy Bobofit threw a sandwich at this boy.<br /> So if you want a page turning book, get The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan. Trust me.  If you get this awesome book, you won't stop reading.
B008469DGY|4.0|It's something you wouldn't mind having on your device when you don't feel like playing that free solitaire you have on there. A lot of replay value because you want to try and beat your score. I am wondering if there is like additional places you can get upon updates. Since we already paid for the app, I think that would be a nice gesture from the makers. The difficulty gets retched up with the winds. You would have to be on your A game or just get mentally frustrated. That's where the 4 stars come in. The difficulty level might get too hard to fast for some. If you like golf, please take the time to get this app. I would have thought it was going to be more traditional like a power meter with different types of clubs, but in this you don't need any of that, just a good flick of the finger. I do recommend this on a tablet than a phone. You are going to need all the space you can get to adjust the golf ball while it is in the air.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great Movie, great quality. This was  a great buy and we watch it all the time, the extra features are fun too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the animation, the colors, the stunts. Different from games I played. I would recommend this game to all.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|It came in great condition and it is a great movie. the director commentary is a bit of a let down, He LOVES to talk about how he expanded the sets more then the grey areas in the plot -_-.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Best Taylor Swift album yet! I always love her music, but this album has the potential to reach even more people. Get it and you won't be disappointed.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|This movie was TOTALLY not what we expected. O.O  it was still good, but in a totally different way. This is a serious/ sad movie, not an action/ sexy girls fun movie.. It is neat to have two disks though, so we can let people barrow the DVD and be surprised like us.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is so unpredictable from front to back and I love that about most of John's books.  The ending was a total surprise!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is not a Bruce Willis or Bill Murray movie.  The stars go to the young performers in this funny tale, although Edward Norton and Cate Blanchett are pretty memorable.<br /><br />A must see for the entire family, and quite possibly the best first kiss ever in film!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Doesnt everyone live on Facebook? I know I do, its great to keep in touch and/or reconnect with friends & family.
B00004TS0E|4.0|I know many fans prefer the original Miracle with Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood, Edmund Gwenn and John Payne, but I find this version equally good and cleverly brought up to date. I'd rate Richard Attenborough's performance ahead of Edmund Gwenn and Mara Wilson the equal of Natalie and more worldly wise with good dialogue to boot. This one is on my must-see Xmas movie list.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My favorite way to waste time! I get sucked in & end up playing & pinning all sorts of stuff for hours! Love this app! Super addictive & really fun!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Every year my dad and I have many Christmas traditions. My favorite one: watching this movie on Christmas Eve. It's a classic, and no matter how many times we watch it, it never gets old.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I am totally addicted to this show....Claire Danes is an amazing actress... the subplots and twists in the show keep my head spinning....SAD I dont have showtime to watch the 2nd season, but I know I will catch up as soon as I can buy it.... LOVE LOVE LOVE, anyone thinking of buying this should definitely cop it cause it is worth it!!!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I have purchased each of Carrie Underwood's albums and \\"Blown Away\\" is her best yet. There is a wide variety with something for everyone. From uptempo rocking Country, to fun and sassy songs, to uplifting and inspirational songs and powerful ballads, Carrie sings them all superbly. She has one of the purest voices in music and on her fourth album she exhibits more nuances to her voice than ever before. Carrie has also grown immensely as a songwriter as some of the best tracks are Carrie's Co-writes. Some standouts for me are: Blown Away, Two Black Cadillacs, See You Again, Cupid's Got a Shotgun, Wine after Whiskey, Good in Goodbye and Forever Changed. I can honestly say that every song is well worth a listen. There is not one song I bypass on this album. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves good music.
B008OIQYTG|4.0|Between the students and big time musicians, Lee has a nice mix going on here.<br />Something not done as much. Much better than The Voice or any of the talent shows. These kids perform well with the Big Timers. Take a listen, and you will buy.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Was fun to play, the hints were cumbersome and would have been better is they returned to the last open hint when returning to that screen during play.and it would have been better if it offered additional quests.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Awesome app.... Can't imagine needing any more features than this app has. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a weather channel for their tablet.
B00338QENI|3.0|I read this book for a book club.  I had no idea it would delve so deeply into the history of cell research!  Those parts were a bit too deep for my brain.  I enjoyed the human interest parts of the book more.  There was too much bouncing around from the past to the present and back again, which made it confusing.  And it would have been nice to have more in the way of time references.  Good story, but may have been more effective if done a little differently.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was very interesting , me and my son enjoyed reading it,  i highly recommend it,  go out and get your copy !!
B005JZBP8W|5.0|The remake was more enjoyable than the original after all those years. The music, on modern equipment, as well as the colours was unbelievable!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you are looking for a delightful exciting drama, this fictional British-American television series depicts the lives of the aristocrat Crawley family and their servants in the post-Edwardian era with many great events of history effecting their lives, such as the sinking of the Titanic, WWI etc.  It is full of excitement and romance taking place in Downton Abbey a huge estate filmed in and around the actual Highclere Castle in Hampshire, with breath-taking beauty!  The cast is most oustanding and believeable with fabulous costumes of the period!  You feel as if you know the Crawley family and their servants as you follow their lives in each of the series.  The servants are very much a part of the family with many interesting events and conversations taking place in the kitchen of this estate!<br />The author and producer of this Great Production are outstanding!  Would love more such Masterpieces produced by these great writers and producers!<br />We can't wait to get Season 3 that is coming soon!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I just finished listening to the whole album. There are chills and thrills aplenty in this magnificent production. Every song is perfect. I wish I could say that about many albums where I find a mere few songs I want to hear again. Susan, keep putting out your annual album and I'll be a happy camper.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I wish I had read other reviews about the app on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" prior to getting the app. Similar to everybody else, it crashes after the second intro screen. I have not been able to play the game. If the creators produce an update that works on the latest version of the Kindle Fire -- which is the one people seem to be buying for Christmas -- I will come back and update my review. For now, it's just taking up space on my app shelf.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Anybody who has watched the HBO show will really enjoy this series.  It adds depth that can't be matched on the TV screen - and that's just the first book.  I have four more to go!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Prometheus was ok,in my opinon it was a little overated by the critics, but streaming was excellent and hd picture quailtiy excellent.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game plays great on my Droid 4. The only complaint I have is I wish it was longer. The graphics are great and it is simple to navigate. The puzzles are challenging, ( I had to use the hints once or twice.). I would definitely recommend this one!
B005ORVMCY|4.0|I love Rush, and have been seeing them since Moving Pictures Tour.<br /><br />The drawback of these box sets is the lack of extras. Simple.<br /><br />We are fans! We want to hear the out-takes, the alternate takes, the unused tracks. I own box sets from artists from the 1950s that contain almost every TAKE of their studio output, a band like Rush can offer more to the rabid fan. And we are rabid fans.<br /><br />As good as the band is, they didnt get everything on take one, and didnt use every song. Give us the extras if you want us to buy the same CD for the 5th time.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|Powerful songs, and excellent lyrics, from a performer who seems wise way beyond her years.<br />This album is one that I listen to when I am riding the train, and it never seems to get old or boring.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|At first I was surprised at how this one had eluded me all these years.  I've worn out every copy I had of &#34;Fillmore East.&#34;  Reviews seemed to be good, so I took a chance.  What a party!  Sound and acoustics are great, yet different from FE.  I love playing it and comparing it to the Brothers' FE treatments of the same songs.  Check it out!
B008GXHOFW|3.0|this game can do a better job on graphics.everything else looks pretty good. so not so bad kuzman out peace
034580404X|5.0|I love these books.  I was able to feel what Ana was feeling, but yet understand where Christian was coming from. Very good story from start to finish with lots of twist and surprises in betweeen.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a typical Vince Flynn thriller!! A real page turner! What will Mitch Rapp encounter next?? And I hope Flynn is not a prophet!

B008NB0SQO|4.0|This is one of my favorite holiday movies so I would rate it 5 stars if it were only about the movie.  I had to dock it one because of the missing &#34;When Love is Gone&#34; song.  I realize that the song wasn't in the original theatrical version (which this DVD is) but the home release is the version I've come to love so this DVD seems incomplete.  I hope that Disney eventually comes out with a Blu-ray that has both versions on it - and yes I will probably buy it.
0316044695|3.0|I picked up this book which was recommended from a respected fellow reader.<br />After finishing the book, I find it hard to criticize the writing style, but, I found it unnecessarily repetitive and simple.<br />The story of Marcus Luttrell and his Seal team is compelling and timely:  We are still engaged in a war in Afghanistan, under conditions which preclude victory.<br />The descriptions of the Seal training made me very thankful for these warriors who fight for me.
B00881VLCE|5.0|love puzzles they need more selections of puzzles so the player has a good variety to chose from.  I hope they do add more puzzles
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Such an addicting series. If you like Walking Dead or Lost you will love this show. It is so good!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Movie had great casting and acting.  It was funny and excellent at demonstrating some of the anxiety and growth in attitude in a group of people facing the realities of growing older.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|I love Rush, and have been seeing them since Moving Pictures Tour.<br /><br />The drawback of these box sets is the lack of extras. Simple.<br /><br />We are fans! We want to hear the out-takes, the alternate takes, the unused tracks. I own box sets from artists from the 1950s that contain almost every TAKE of their studio output, a band like Rush can offer more to the rabid fan. And we are rabid fans.<br /><br />The DVD &#34;Taking Center Stage&#34; has EVERY Song on the tour played in isolation live, and in a studio, live, and at Half-Speed. Now THAT is what Rush Fans Want!<br /><br />As good as the band is, they didnt get everything on take one, and didnt use every song. Give us the extras if you want us to buy the same CD for the 5th time.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I'm generally a bond fan and I really like this new bond.  He's smart.  He's sexy.  But we went to see this new movie and, when it was finished, we all just looked at one another and shrugged.  None of us liked it.  Boom - boom - bang - bang - boom - boom - hey, you're getting old - boom - boom.  That's about the plot and the dialog.  Seems that a lot of people liked it.  Shrug.  Maybe they are programmed by the telly to want to watch violence in movies.  I guess it helps them to be complacent when they see innocent people in other countries being murdered so we can steal their oil.  Like I say, I really like bond movies, but I cannot recommend this one.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Got this as the FAOTD. Took me back to playing games like Myst 15 years ago. Finished the game in a couple hours but would have been well worth a buck. Great way to fill a few hours on a flight or a boring conference. :-)
B008ODZNLG|4.0|This is well worth watching, excellent production value, very little hand-held footage.  A compelling story of a master sushi chef in Japan who now 85, still relishes going to work everyday while passing on his skills to his sons who will eventually take over his business.  The only thing missing is the real answer as to what it is about this art that takes so many years to learn.  Beautifully shot in HD, easy to watch.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was my first book to read on my iPad, and I really liked the experience.  John Grisham is one of my favorite authors, and can't wait for his next book!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well I like this gave but it should cost like 5 or 6 dollars maybe even 4 if those were the prices 5 stars
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Another amazing book about Anne, the Duke of Warwick's youngest daughter. Tells of the manipulation the Duke did in order to get his daughters on the throne (he didn't care which daughter). Displays the regard men had for women and how they had to be creative in order to protect their own interests. Can't wait for the next one!
B009AMAMF2|5.0|I went to this movie mostly based on a Roger Ebert 4 star review, noting that it had otherwise received mixed reviews. He mentioned that it needed to be seen more than once to understand the story better, and I completely agree. I had not read the book at the time of going to the movie, so I had no preconceptions. At first viewing, the movie was quite confusing as it jumped around between stories, tho I eventually settled into the thread of each. Being madly in love myself, I found that the more these love stories developed, the more I was drawn in, and the more it reached my heart. By the end of the first viewing, I was sobbing uncontrollably....and I rarely cry in movies. Both the sadder endings and the happier ones had the same effect...<br /><br />I went the next night for my second viewing, and was able to follow the story lines much more clearly. Whatever the magic was, as the end drew near, I was again crying my eyes out, starting at a much earlier point than the first viewing! I had always pretty much poopooed the idea of reincarnation, but the beauty of these souls finding each other time after time was so touching....is so touching...I'm crying right now as I write this! The thought that I knew my lover in a different life actually makes sense of why we seemed to connect instantly, and go on deeper than I have ever been in my life. That we might meet again would be so precious! I know that wishing doesn't make it so, but it's a beautiful thought, and this is one of the most, if not the most beautiful films I have ever seen.<br /><br />I then read the book, which I found interesting, tho a little hard to follow at first. In a way, I wish I had read it before seeing the movie. It did fill in a lot of gaps, as the book always does. After the incredible emotional impact of the movie, I was a little disappointed in the book, as it just didn't take me to the same place the movie had.<br /><br />Anyway, see the movie!
B005LAII1C|5.0|If you want a movie just for laughs and nothing more, look no further. Ted is a typical comical production by Seth MacFarlane. If you currently enjoy watching Family Guy, American Dad, The Cleveland Show, or any other production by Seth Macfarlane, you will not be disappointed. Please be aware that this movie is NOT for kids. For parents out there looking for a 'clean' movie, steer clear of this and stick with Pixar. The last thing a kid needs to memorize is the Thunderbuddies Song. Nonetheless, the word play in the movie just makes you laugh at every point along the story. When watching this film in the theater, I was careful when drinking my Sprite in fear of coughing it up on the people in front of me. So don't forget your napkins.<br /><br />I also do not condone the negative reviews for this movie. While it might not have the definitive story that even the basic comedy movies contain, Ted isn't so much about story. The goal of Seth Macfarlane was to make us laugh at every turn of the picture without recourse. For me, he accomplished this goal. I admit the crude humour is not for everybody, but do not let that detract that this is a terrible movie in the slightest respect. So please, watch or rent before you buy and make your final decision. Just remember we all have a pot-smoking, drunk cuddly teddy bear somewhere in us. Enjoy the movie mates! ;)
B00002IJ48|5.0|I cannot be considered a hardcore Alice in Chains fan, but I have always appreciated their music and was very sad when Layne Staley died in 2002 and then Mike Starr last year (2011).  I don't care how many incarnations there are of Alice in Chains, it's not the same without them.<br /><br />With that said, I picked this up because I loved their music and it brings me back to better times, but what pleasantly surprised me was that I liked every minute of this video (yes, even the shots of the atrocious kitchen sink).  Their dedication to their music was obvious, the devotion of their core fans crystal clear, and that passion came through in every video.<br /><br />I was used to hearing many of these songs on the radio as a teen, but watching these videos all these years later was a pleasant experience.  It's always interesting listening to music with older ears because you have a tendency to regret not appreciating it more at the time it came out.  That's what happened to me with \\"Video Bank.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, I fell into that category of labeling Alice in Chains as just another grunge/alternative band from Seattle, but that was a huge mistake.  In reality, they put out some damned good music (along with the rest of the Seattle supergroups) that fails to sound dated over 20 years later.<br /><br />This is one of the best video compilations I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few).  I like the way there are two videos, then concert footage or home video, then one or two more videos, etc.  The whole thing was very well put together and I'd recommend it to anyone who's either a hardcore Alice in Chains buff or someone just discovering their music.  - Donna Di Giacomo
0545265355|5.0|A very good presentation, easy to read font size and format. I recommend it for older teens and adults alike -
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This was ok, but I did get a little fed up because the levels are quite hard and I had to buy those expensive things to complete most of the levels. It hasn't been a problem with the earlier games, but I would not recommend this one as it's a little too gimmicky for my liking.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Red is a fresh new taylor swift album and i loved it. She incorporated more pop this time around! AWESOME
B008XBASVY|5.0|This book was a very funny read for me but it definitely brought some memories of how high school can suck in a small town.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|When I began this book, I thought it was sooo boring that I was going to stop reading it, but I continued to read and boy, what a shocker of an ending.  Great book.  The movie was okay.  The kids who played Kevin did a very good job of acting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a plain calculator to add up simple daily home addition s and this calculator was perfect forthat and free !!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is my first year watching this series and I'm inlove with it! I want to get the first season!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This movie is beautifully done.  I very seldom give a 5 star review for any movie but this one deserves it.  I have stayed away from a lot of  the musicals that are now being offered to the public but I would recommend this one.
1607886197|5.0|a very good book could hardly put it down it was so good but it was long so had to
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My family and I are a huge Disney movie fans and all things Disney. I was a little sceptical of Brave but my wife talked me into it and we rented it for my son's third birthday with the entire family over to watch. I along with my kids, wife in-laws and thensome truly enjoyed it. I recommend it whether or not you're a Disney fan.
B008VBYN80|4.0|this is a fun little distraction to play if you have the time.<br />I would recommend this to any town builder
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor Swift is a phenomenal instance of huge talent.  She was the angel of country and has moved or has been moved by excellent handling into the cutthroat world of pop where she continues to excel.  Her videos are lovely, her voice perfect, her look is from Botticelli and is quite indescribable.  She is simply an amazing phenom and her next move will probably blow minds yet again.  Someone to admire and watch as she grows!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Tom Cruise should do more villain roles.  I find him inherently unlikable to begin with, so being the heavy in a story should be second nature to him.  And playing ice-cold hitman Vincent in Michael Mann's stunning thriller COLLATERAL, Cruise is at his gruesome best.  The story is original, and it's a beaut:  For one dark night in LA, Vincent \\"borrows\\" a cab and its driver, Max (one of Jamie Foxx's best roles, in my humble opine), to make five different stops to kill four thugs and one prosecutor (Jada Pinkett Smith) who have sold out the mob.  The dialogue inside the cab makes this movie, as Vincent's no-nonsense style forces Max to come to grips with the facade that is his life--and forces Max to make a life-or-death decision that will have lasting consequences.<br /><br />Mann is a sensational director, and he brings to the screen a gritty, brutal tale, with a seedy LA becoming a character all its own.  The action sequences, particularly in the nightclub, are nothing short of stellar.  Cruise is in serious physical shape to play this role, and it shows; Vincent is one nasty hombre.  Mark Ruffalo turns in a solid performance playing a cop who ultimately ends up a day late and a dollar short.  The climactic sequences at the prosecutor's office that move to the public transit are also well done, but this is where the movie stumbles just a bit; it's way, way over the top.  Yet that aspect didn't take away from my total enjoyment of COLLATERAL.  This shoot-'em-up is one grand white-knuckle seat squirmer.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B00992CF6W|5.0|plz make it the free app of the day I know ill love it but I cant buy it my parents wont let me :(
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|I love the heroes of olympus series...but this one just wasnt the same. Didnt quite click for me. Still awesome.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so much fun!!! when I cant complete a level I go crazy:) its fun and addictive you should get this game!!!!!!:)
B007MDB548|5.0|Very pleased with the speed of the delivery. And the DVD case itself, it so cool. It's 3d image. My five year old granddaughter is going to be happy.
3864070570|5.0|Don't get confused: In the title is only the Spanish language mentioned but in fact it is translated to EIGHT languages: English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Swedish. This opulent editorial coffeetable book is made for a world wide fan audience! It is not an encyclopedia but a personal and clever selection of the most thrilling and emotional moments of this special era when the large marques and (many missed) great idols battled on the tarmac. 'One word: MAGIC!', Jacky Ickx said by phone after receiving his copy.<br />In case you are more after Formula 1 (historic and modern) I suggest this heavy editorial book: [[ASIN:3864070562 Schlegelmilch 50 Years of Formula 1 photography (Spanish Edition)]]
B002PEXMVI|1.0|CD was scratched could not listen to cd was disappointed but will look for cd from different sight price was good
B008JAGZDE|1.0|Wasn't as good as I hoped. Commercials made it sous a lot funnier. Didn't deliver and some funny scenes were just korny.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The ending of the book was fantastic. The only problem is that the 3rd book doesn't come out until next years. I almost cried when I saw the release day .This series is fun and erotic. If you are like me and absolutely loved 50 shades that this is a MOST read!!!!!!!!
0525952926|4.0|This series really grabs a reader.  Following several families through the first half of the 20th century (so far) the book weaves a tapestry through the politics, and brutality of war while maintaining interest.  I don't think it is as engaging as the first book, but it is still recommended.  Somehow the first book had more approachable characters.
0670022411|5.0|I'm rarely so excited and enticed after reading a book. But \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" had too many aspects of my favorite topics in it: Clearly recognizable and differentiated historical facts and fiction (I like to be entertained while learning something useful), surprising new interpretation of vampires, witches and demons, superb story telling, fast action, Science (Bio-)Chemistry and Genetics, Oxford University, strong women, magic, Massachusetts, Salem, medieval castle in France.<br /> \\"Who dunnit\\" suspense on multiple levels - so many secrets and twists and turns that you're breathlessly seeking for more explanations (and you won't be disappointed)<br />I can easily forget that some things are moving forward too quickly - like change of prejudices or long cultivated resentments. Since it is about magical creatures: Who knows - maybe they change feelings more quickly than humans :-)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The premise of this game is simple,  but it's very addictive.  I have the free version but will probably buy the extra levels so I can keep playing.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|it's not Christmas until I see this movie can't wait to watch it over and over any time I want!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|As a Sherlock Holmes fan from way back I appreciate the new Holmes & Watson combo.  The movie is entertaining from start to finish.  I highly recommend the movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved loved this book. I couldn't put it down. My only regret was that I read it to fast. I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.
B009SIE6AA|2.0|James Taylor's odd renditions of old Christmas favorites was disappointing.  I wanted to here his soothing baritone voice bring classic Holiday songs into my home.  Instead I got this.  The addition of the Beatles Here Comes the Sun doesn't fit well with the other song choices either.  I just took most of this record out of my Christmas music mix.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|As someone involved in transport modelling and forecasting for many years, I really appreciated the insights in Nate Silver's book, and also the plain English way in which he explains his ideas. This book should be a must-read for all graduate students involved in modelling and forecasting, although it is also a great read for anyone wanting to understand the strengths and limitations of the forecasts we all see around us in daily life.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like the game and the mini games it provides. I just don't like how social interaction is a must and how you must buy more coins to achieve quests.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Started reading with mixed feelings because this is not the type of book that I normally read but was hooked from page 1
B005HEVBGG|5.0|It was easy to go through the steps to be able to view the show.  Always liked this particular Star Trek.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades of Freed was my favorite out of all 3 books. But I can't lie. I absolutely loved all 3 books. I loved them so much I read them 3 times. These books were addicting. Reading them!!!!!!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|great puzzle game with awesome graphics and characters. i would recommend this for kids and adults. kind of addictive and has a story line.
B003TH14H4|2.0|It's no fun to watch a show  that freezes up. I had to forward ahead and skip a scene to finish the show.
8866130923|2.0|This will be my sixth year using this planner, and sadly may be the last. The front calendar is now lines instead of blocks, which makes it difficult to have an overview of 2013.<br /><br />Please bring back the block calendar!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Very good movie i liked that after watching this movie you could watch MIB 1 and feel like it just loops around.<br />Very solid to me.
B000I9WW4U|5.0|Just as I remembered -<br />The review?..........<br />Despite the &#34;sameness&#34; (ha. ha),  this will........ as always......... be - one of the best &#34;feel good' movies of the decade!
B0086700CM|2.0|just love this app. truely amazing . good job done by the developers really . you should offer free coins occassionally . that will be cool really.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|The book was slow moving in the beginning, picked up a bit in the middle and lasted a little too long
078322804X|4.0|The big problem that the film encountered upon its release was that it puzzled people who really weren't quite sure what they should make of it? I look upon it more as a descendent of Vaudeville or the Music Hall as it was known in Britain than anything else. A show on Vaudeville was a series of acts which were unrelated. The Blues Brothers is a series of acts held together by the story of Jake and Elwood who progress from act to act in the scenes through the film. Really what do you do when the whole world is after you? The stunts in the film are quite good. Then the boys are constantly running into some of the big names in soul and the blues on their quest for the money that will save the orphanage. It's definitely a good film. Something that you can watch on numerous occasions. John Belushi and Dan Akroyd do a fantastic job from start to finish.
1401235417|5.0|All the reviews pretty much say it all, this comic is great. Im mainly putting this review to add another number to the 5 star slot encouraging people to buy this well done comic.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This is a great movie for movie goers and people who like the prohibition era.  Good movie for SURE!  Gotta see!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the moment i started i could not stop reading it is the best book i ever read!! I cant wait to read the second book!!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My husband and I missed a couple episodes on TV, so it's nice to know we can watch them here. Not a bad price, and Amazon is always offering good deals.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Fantastic series. By far one of the best shows on Tv. Definitely worth watching. Can not wait to watch season two and three.
B0058A119G|5.0|I love any thing Barbra Streisand does and this was no different. Shipping was quick and the product was as described in original packaging and in perfect condition.
1423136802|3.0|I do not know what this is about but if not with a Biblical story, I do not care for this.  The child requested it for a gift.
B009NOVCTM|2.0|Everything about this album is just bad. From the atrocious cover and title to the ridiculous tracklisting. It's terrible.<br /><br />Ok, let's start it with the obvious... how do they forget the Ya-Ya's version of Midnight Rambler AGAIN!? Hell, even the album version would be acceptable. That song is undeniably a Stones classic, in every single sense of the word. It was bad enough to miss it on 40 Licks, but its omission here is indefensible. That alone would stop me from buying it or recommending it.<br /><br />You could make a full CD of songs that don't deserve to be here. More than half the third disc is garbage from their worst years of songwriting. Then some \\"classics\\" that don't really deserve the title appear again in place of true hidden gems. Are Not Fade Away, Have You Seen Your Mother, Fool to Cry, Respectable, and The Last Time really better songs than Can't You Hear Me Knocking, Moonlight Mile, Let It Bleed, and All Down the Line?<br /><br />And come on... Streets of Love, Harlem Shuffle, Highwire, Love is Strong, Anybody Seen My Baby, Don't Stop?? Over album cuts like Sway, Bitch, and Monkey Man? I get you want to have a collection that spans their entire career, but they should really focus on the golden years, rather than equal time allowed for these awful 90s cuts. Hell, I mean even We Love You, Little Red Rooster, and Heart of Stone are bad choices.<br /><br />Look, I know I have a bias. I LOVE these boys. Disregarding whatever category The Beatles might fall into, they are inarguably the single greatest rock `n' roll band of all time. But even as a major major fan, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone interested in getting into the Stones. I cut my teeth on this band with 40 Licks. It was a good intro to the band... or should I say disc one was a good intro to the band. It's basically the same story here, although they were smart enough to add She Was Hot (even though the Shine a Light version is much better) and the killer, kick-ass, powerhouse Rocks Off. Other than that, there is no difference between them.<br /><br />5 stars for the music, obviously. I mean some of these songs still bring a tear to my eye when I listen to `em. Insanely, absurdly, unbelievably great stuff. But don't get this album. It's not worth the price. Find a friend who loves the Stones (if you're smart, you'll have a few) and ask them to make you a mix. Or get 40 Licks, used, for a couple bucks. Just stay away from this nonsense.<br /><br />No Midnight Rambler!?<br />The title \\"GRRR!\\"!??<br />...a gorilla!?<br /><br />I give up... I'm going to my room and putting on Sticky Fingers.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I really love the way these 5 people make such a big sound with their voices. And how innovative they are with their sound. This album doesn't disappoint in either of these respects. I especially like Carol of the Bells but I'm enjoying all the songs.
0525953728|5.0|I was hooked off the get go and I didn't want to lay the book down until I was finish reading it.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Love jason segel but this movie was not as funny as I thought it would be. Slightly disappointing and the previews for the movie give away the real funny scenes.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I Love this bag. It's a great size and it is good quality.I can easily fit my camera, external flash, and 5-6 lenses in it.<br /><br />Update after using this for over four years.<br />I have been using this item for long time now and have even been abusing it, yet it is still standing strong. What a great bag for my camera. I am so happy I got this and I recommend it. It is worth every penny you pay.
1419705849|4.0|Miguel thought this book was funny.  It is about a Valentine dance.  Miguel thinks eight year olds will be entertained by this book.
0374533571|2.0|I got this book because of the trailer alone, with Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. I was expecting the same witty dialogue going back and forth between the two, which is almost non-existant in the book. Also, the concept of the narrator being mentally incapacitated in some way seems to be a trend these days, and I'm starting to think that it's a cover for the author to be able to write in very simple, and quite frankly, easy to write language. There are a few funny moments, but for the most part the book is monotonous, repetitive, and predictable. The characters don't go deep enough for me. If not for the movie, which I am still looking forward to because I think they've added where the book is lacking, I wouldn't have read it.
B000ICXQS8|5.0|Between the writing, the acting, the emotion of the story and the breathtaking scenery &#34;beautiful&#34; is the best description of this film. The emotional range of the film goes from sweet to sad to frustrating to heartbreaking but in the end, even if you are bawling like a baby after the credits roll you'll still be glad you watched it.
B0091VTNZC|5.0|We (kids 3,5 and 7) love this movie and watch it every year. It is now a permanent part of our holiday traditions.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I couldn't wait to get back to this book every time I set it down.  I loved how the author described the changing world in the two continents and how he manged to intertwine all the characters.  I can't wait for Book Three
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is a typical Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' novel - fantastic!!<br />I love this character and only wish I could write one like it.  The pace is excellent and the ending well thought out.<br />don't miss it. buy it on Kindle.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|Each of the stories in this collection is good but each leaves you wanting more.  Sort of like smelling a fresh baked apple pie that you will never get a taste of.  Each story would make a great first chapter of a larger book, but not enough to make it worth the effort.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|This is an adorable movie about a rat in Paris who wants to be a chef.<br />It is a great gift for anyone who is a &#34;foodie&#34; or has small children, or is inlove with cooking or france.<br />The soundtrack is also very good. this movie is all age appropriate.
B006O6F932|4.0|as with most items you have to put together, it was a bit tedious clicking the doors/windows in...need a lil elbow grease  ;)  and one of the windows keeps coming off...  otherwise, my 9 year old put it together and is having a great time with it!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|50 Shades of Grey with different names for their characters.  Very entertaining to read.  These books are fun and spicy!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The movie is fantastic, and I love watching it.  But I didn't like the packaging of it.  They stack the discs on top of each other, 2 per side.
B008H5J510|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites, the packaging is fun, it comes with 3 dvd's and even in 3D. I highly reccomend this movie pack. It is great fun for the whole family!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This book was more investigation than brute force so it was nice to see Reacher uncover the facts. Plus a little love affair with an older woman to spice things up.  Never a dull moment.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next one! This one brought back a lot of the original characters that were missed in the last book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|great book...couldn't put it down..this was a page Turner for me!!  Didn't know what to expect with this book..loved it!

I hear it at least 6 times a day...BUT I NEVER TIRE OF IT :)  I'm not even a huge Tony Bennett fan but have to say it's one of the best holiday recordings ever made.  There's variety in terms of up-tempo and slower songs and All I Want For Christmas Is You is my favorite...definitely one you can slow dance to and very romantic!  It's a great marriage of vocalist and arrangements.  I highly recommend this album!!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Animation is awesome, plot pretty decent, 'acting' pretty decent, comic relief is very entertaining. Its a solid animated film, but not as good as the Incredibles.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love love this BBC production. The idea of giving the traditional character of Sherlock Holmes access to the width and breadth of the Internet and instantaneous communication has given birth to a loveable/hateable reincarnation of Holmes that no one can resist. This series is very strong at the beginning and end but I have my hypotheses on the necessity of the middle episode that seems weak by comparison but that may prove the key to the cliffhanger at the end of episode 3. Trust me, you need to watch this series. You won't be sorry.
B006JTS5OO|1.0|Package came and totally smelt of cigarette smoke.  Movie was new and unopened, but the inside of the package and movie has a horrible stale smoke smell.  Totally nasty.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|I loved this book.  Filled with simple and easy to understand concepts.  The book contained great examples to back up the words written.  I gave it 5 stars because it deserved it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie was very funny and had my grandson and husband laughing all through it.It was well priced and  came quickly.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Great follow up to Matched.  Could not put this one down.  Even more exciting. Very good storytelling.  I went straight to Reached the moment I finished.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This movie has the tone of the other films (ie. Iron Man, Thor), which is great. They do a surpirsing good job of stitching all the characters together for this film. And the finally do the Hulk right---&#62;stupendous
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|For a bunch of old guys they put together an interesting and entertaining story. The one liners really appeal to the Baby boomer generation. Funny stuff from our past.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Wow! I really enjoyed the last man I couldnt put it down, very fast moving great charactors and plot to this story
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a good love story but I wouldn't call it great 50% of the book was him convincing her why they should stay married and then her trying to figure out if his reasons were good enough. Then she agreed and 20% more was of her trying to convince him that it wasn't  \\" I can't cook, I wear face mask, I get caught up in my work....etc.\\" the book was very well written and the characters well rounded. They sex scenes were good but seemed unfinished or rushed not really that spicy. But I gave the book 4 stars because even though it wasn't quite my kind of book it still was a good book and still worth the read!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My family and I have been fans of the show since it started. We bought the first season, so when I asked my child what she wanted for Christmas this year, this was one of the first items on her list, so we got it for her. There was no question or hesistation.  I know when she opens it, she will love it.  Items shipped quickly, it came when I was told, and packaging was perfect.
0062127241|4.0|I just finished Pete Townsend's autobiography, Who Am I. Kind of engrossing. I would suggest plowing through the early family years as fast as possible: they are not nearly as interesting as he thinks they are. You can slow down, or even start at the point just as he meets his future musical partners. Most of the book is like a series of car wrecks, sometimes literally. The temperature changes, to mix metaphors, after the high point of The Who's career. He becomes incredibly wealthy. No matter what he does from then on out he just makes more money. I am also slogging my way through Walter Issacson's Ben Franklin bio, which is pretty workmanlike. Every time I would jump over to Pete Townsend, and I know what a jump that is, I was always surprised at how enjoyable it was. I'd recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I honestly think the raving reviews are from people who have never read erotica before. This reads like it was written by a talented high school student (style-wise) and there's better erotica authors out there. The love scenes get repetative and I found the main female character to be naive to the point of being annoying.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|a girl who had a plan went to her cousin's wedding and got married to a guy one very blurry night. she wakes up and agrees after much persuasion to do a trial period. the first month, she tested him with everything possible. the second, she fell hard for him. then reality hit and she broke it off. a few months later, she is trying to piece together her heart and he is finally facing his past emotions. she then sees him at the door and he tells her what he found out, kissed her,  and tells her that he loves her. this book is a very light read and was very enjoyable.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|I bought this for my nephew.  He loves Legos, but he's 13 and most builds are too easy for him now.  I can't wait to give him this for Christmas. Impressive box and I'm sure this will take him some time!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved this book, if you like Kate Mortons forgotten garden you will enjoy this one. I takes me in and eats me alive. I didn't sleep for a week, considering I had to work as well. The book paint a picture of WW1 that I have never thought about. I know it's fiction but it gives the people, the star crossed lovers of that time a story.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|This movie has taken multiple sittings to struggle through.<br /><br />The cast is all-star, best Hollywood has had in years for the genre. The old action heroes still look good, and are in fact still believable (or no less so than they ever were).<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that it's basically garbage. It feels a dishonor not to watch it because of the cast, but the action is so absurd it would make an 80's action movie blush. I enjoyed the first Expendables but this one piles on the nonsense, and the action scenes are so over the top that they are not even enjoyable. Example: driving with one hand and with the other machine-gunning enemies with near-perfect accuracy. Sniping people half a mile or more out as they cruise along at 30-40+ knots on a boat. Never missing.<br /><br />The Chuck Norris cameo was stupid and just put in place because Chuck Norris was free for a day of shooting.<br /><br />Boring cliches done a thousand times before: men abducted to work as slaves and when one slave complains of fatigue he's shot, followed up with the request to other works if any of them are tired. Arnold told that if he fails to return a guy's weapon that he'll be \\"terminated\\". ad tedium
B003QSS2VW|5.0|This movie never gets old. So cute and fun. Makes me all kinds of happy. I'd recommend everyone watch this.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Some may say they saw the end coming, but I read a lot of mystery novels and this one caught me off guard. I knew there was going to be a twist from the first couple of chapters, but the actual plot changes weren't at all what I expected. Good pace and easy, fun read.
1451695195|3.0|good book although not exactly what i expected. Would reccommend to people with medical background. Rate it 3 stars out of 5
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My husband thinks it's cheesy, but I love fairy tales and being able to still watch them as an adult! The writers smoothly incorporate characters that you would never think would fit together!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Can't wait for the movie! Very similar to the other 2 books and sometimes was a little boring, but I couldn't wait to finish it and find out what the &#34;ending&#34; was...
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I purchased this book because the movie version seemed very interesting. I am pleased to say that the book is far better than the movie.
B005YVTHT0|5.0|The wheel is great. Steering is very accurate and the adjustments available make for easy customization. One thing I miss is force feedback, but for a sub-C note wheel - this is a great product.
B001KZG99A|5.0|No matter how often I see this movie, I always enjoy it.  One of the best superhero movies I've seen!  And the convenience of Amazon instant is great.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It works just like I need it to. Also, I did not know that it came with labelling stickers included!
B001S86J2Q|5.0|This picture in blu-ray looks so stunning and almost too realistic.  I really enjoyed watching this again and am glad I have it on blu-ray.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|This is by far one of his best, he paints such an awesome picture with words it leaves you craving more. If there is one complaint it's that I finished the book to soon and now I'm fiending for more.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I love leps world because it is fun cool amazing and well just out out of this world. I think the best level is level three.
0345495004|4.0|Read this for our book club and really enjoyed it. Mamah's ideas regarding priorities - worthy of much discussion. Interesting background info on FLR, his family and his love of nature. And the ending . . . WOW!
B000HF0IIC|3.0|The older Batman movies just can't compare to the new ones.  So long as you recognize that fact, then the movie is fun but there is no comparison with the Christian Bale ones.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Very well put together. Can't wait to start the next one! Hope it is just as good, or better!
B0043EV774|5.0|Wow, how beautiful, I was so taken aback but the 3d features that I caught myself  occasionally not paying attention to the story line, love it.
0440419514|2.0|First book great....I think by the end of the second book I began being disappointed...the 3rd book ended pretty lousy.  The central part regarding if there is nor is not a God is something to think about.
0767903862|4.0|If you like Bill Bryson as an author, I am sure you will enjoy this description of Australia.  He adds funny little quips, which make the book a good read.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great but slow to rebuild energy. I love to play at work. I love gaming. I love space monkies. I love...
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie. It's funny, entertaining and clever. I bought a copy to share with others.  I enjoyed it each time I watched it.
B005PK553C|5.0|I normally don't watch this genre but the story was so compelling it just drew me in.  Now I have season 2 set up on my DVR and am still amazed that the same guy who does Glee is responsible for this show which is the complete opposite!
B00540G3G6|5.0|I never actually seen this movie, my daughters have it in VHS and now blu-ray but I wanted to spoil myself and purchased the 3d version and loved it.  Great addition to my collection.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Soo much fun.  I'm glad it's on DVD because I don't have cable.  Can't wait for the next season. Wish they made more episodes each year.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|wow. The first book was good but this one is better. Cannot wait for Entwined with you to come out!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I purchased the original Halloween movie -- love watching this around Halloween time and each time I go to rent it, it's out and not available for weeks -- so now I have my own copy!  Love it -- this is one of the only movies that frightens me and can't watch it alone.
1845767055|5.0|Having come across Paul's work in Games Workshop's game series and Mutant Chronicles I was always impressed by his vivid life like scenes, the emotion on the faces of his subjects and the fantastical settings. This incredible book shows off a great selection of his works covering most areas including some I had never come across. The paper and print quality are excellent and the layout is well thought through. Highly recommended!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|By now we are so used to Johnny in these types of character roles, great job as usual but the story dragged on a bit.
B007L5KT76|5.0|What can I say other then it is a stunning picture, the picture quality is gorgeous.  Have both part 1 and now 2.
1451695195|5.0|I am hoping to buy this book for a number of friends. The implications of Eben's story are truly astonishing,and leave you feeling better for having read it.  If a near death experience was going to happen to anyone, it had to be him. He is the perfect emissary of the world beyond.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|This documentary gives a person a look in to what could be on the other side of on line dating. Very intertaining as well .I thought it was well done . The show to follow is great too.
0547884591|5.0|The recipes are not only amazing, but are presented in a groundbreaking way--these are recipes you can actually MAKE, and with limited ingredients, time, and fuss. The price is worth the recipe/process for \\"Osso Buko\\" alone!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This a great game to add to your collection for a quick something to do while waiting at the doctor's office or just winding down at night.
B009KHCT94|3.0|Nazi's on the dark side of the moon? Why not? Entertaining but not much else can be said if given another chance I wouldn't have rented it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|The game play is simple, but your greed for braiiiiins will be your downfall. This is probably a better game for a smaller crowd, as you have nothing to do while waiting for the other players' turns to be over.
1401937519|5.0|the book is well written, from the heart and I found it difficult to put down. If only we could all act on the lessons that are within this book.
B008ELUEQC|1.0|.....go back to rock, where the guitars can drown out your voice. He used to be a great rock singer, but this is just terrible. It's like listening to Frank Sinatra singing classic Christmas tunes, only if Frank Sinatra was a parrot with laryngitis.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I give it five stars because it's the best free office app I have found for the android operating system.  The only draw back I found when using when trying to print to my Kodak printer I have to use google cloud instead of using the WI-FI option on the printer. This is a Kodak problem though and not that of Kingsoft. It is easy to use and the price is right so if you are looking for an office app you want to check this one out.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This makes my Kindle worth even more when I need to take a quick note and can't place my hand on paper and pen.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Really excellent feel good movie that would love to see turned into a mini series. More of this PLEASE! Pretty PLEASE!
0547569653|3.0|I was thrilled with Scot Jurek since I have read Born to run and I was looking forward to read this guy's book. It has great stories and it seems that Scott had tough childhood, one that makes you own look even brighter. Races he won are out of mind and it is hard not to get inspired for your lousy 5k run after reading this.<br />I am sorry to say that sometimes he gets really boring with this &#34;eating plants makes me Superman&#34; approach. It is nice to take care of diet beacuse I also try to but I am not going around telling everyone how that changed me as a person and improved my life. Book is not written with passion and not interesting as Born to run; sorry but I have to make comparison between two of these. Only last few chapters bring true emotions in this book.<br />All in all, book is worth reading beacuse of this incredible guy but it is too bad it was not written better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this program.  Works well comes up quickly on my Kindle.  The colors are good and the play is fun.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very cool to hear kind of a different view on after life experiences.  He was a science guy and not very religious yet still had an amazing experience! Great read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Unexpected twists and turns kept me reading. I thought the ending fit the story. I am planning on reading the other novels by this author.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Another one of those quick additions for your Kindle making it just that much more useful for the person on the go.
B005GVF95O|4.0|I got this game so my little neices and nephews can play it on my Kindle.  I tried it out and had no problems.  I love puzzles and want to get the kids to love them too.  Should help them learn shapes and use their brains.  Graphics are nice and its easy to use.  I think the little ones (ages 3 and up) will enjoy it.  Great value for 99 cents!
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|What really can I say. You know that that movie is awesome otherwise you would not be looking at this review. Just but it already.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Really enjoyed the twist and the humor. Great idea in making this movie again and I love the chemistry these two have together.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Kids loved this movie and so did mommy and daddy!  Wish they had movies like this when I was a little kid!
1451695195|4.0|I chose the rating rather than the four stars because of my shortcomings.  I am not a scientist and had difficulty with that part of the book.  I almost think Dr. Alexander should write two books: one for the scientist and one for the rest of us.<br />As stated above the science was over my head but I really liked the fact that the book brings hope.  At lease it brought hope to me.  I have always been a believer but this makes it easier to be comfortable in my own dying.<br />I would recommend the book to anyone with an open mind.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|\\"The morning after the election, I woke up...thinking about you.\\"    Background    I must admit: somehow I \\"missed\\" this movie when it originally played in theaters. In fact, I had never even heard of it until I was at the department store, back in the summer, and the film's dvd caught my eye. My initial thought was, \\"How was this a straight-to-dvd film considering the star power headlining it?\\"    That just goes to show you how much (or not so much) I know.    As I stated, the dvd case/film poster caught my eye. I liked the shot of the two leads, hand in hand, on the run from...well, I had no idea...but I wanted to find out. I also could not get over just how gorgeous Emily Blunt looked. Now, please do not misunderstand me, I have been well aware of her ever since first seeing her in The Devil Wears Prada, and more recently in The Young Victoria (a very good film you also should check out). But, I had never seen her look this stunning. I was like, wow....    I hope thalia989 doesn't read that.    Ironically, however, as anxious as I was to check out the movie (yes, I purchased it on the spot), I didn't get around to viewing it until recently...and am only now getting around to reviewing it. It is a great movie, and one you should definitely check out.    The Adjustment Bureau    Directed by George Nolfi, and based on the short story, Adjustment Team, by science-fiction author Phillip K. Dick (whose literary works have been \\"converted\\" into theatrical films such as Total Recall, and the incomparable science-fiction masterpiece, Blade Runner), The Adjustment Bureau is, on its surface, a romantic, roller-coaster ride of an action thriller featuring two young lovers who want, more than anything else in the world, to be together...they just happen to have everything...and I do mean everything, working against them.    Going a bit deeper, ok, a lot more deeper, themes such as pre-destination, free will, and The Enlightenment permeate the entire movie...which is about a young, \\"rock-star\\" New York Congressman, David Norris (Matt Damon), and his current bid to run for the United States Senate (a not-so-coincedental parallel to President Barack Obama in 2004). At a speech/fund-raiser, David steps into the men's room to catch a breather and gather his thoughts. Unbeknownst to David (but not for long) also hiding in the bathroom...for ostensibly the same reasons is Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). David, immediately attracted to her (and vice-versa) asks her what she is doing in he men's room. She replies that she is \\"hiding\\" from security because \\"I just crashed a wedding.\\" David says that \\"I didn't know people still did that,\\" and quickly, all of the small talk leads to a passionate, lingering  kiss. It is \\"out-of-the-blue,\\" yet works beautifully. As a viewer, not only did it not surprise me, it made perfect sense (more on this later). Elise, however, abruptly states she has to go and David, disappointed but inspired, goes back out to the floor and makes a speech that all but guarantees his election.    A few weeks later, he has a chance encounter with Elise on an AM  bus and gets her phone number. However, David has to commit her number to memory as the feisty Elise accidentally (or, on purpose?) drops his cell phone into his cup of coffee.    This is where things really start to get weird.    David arrives at his office, and, well...I refuse to tell you what happens here, but let's just say that there are a group of men, splendidly sartorially attired--which includes hats (hint, hint)--and they have the ability to transport themselves through time and space. It may sound silly, but trust me, it isn't. They also have a message for David: he is--very soon--going to be President of the United States, and a great president at that.    One more thing: he also better stay away from Elise and have no more contact with her. Even worse, if he tells her--or anyone else--about this meeting, and its revelations, they will....    ....I am not givingaway anything else about this movie's plot. It would be a crime if I spoiled it for you...so I won't. I will tell you that from this point forward you will have completely, as the movie's viewer, entered a mad, alternate fantasy world that will take you on a frantically-paced run as you follow David and Elise's story, all throughout it. You will also stay on the edge of your seat rooting for these two characters to somehow find a way to be together...all the time hoping that, by the movie's end, that you won't be disappointed.    So, go see the movie to find out how all of this is going to play out! I am not saying anything else about its story. However, I will talk about...    ...A Few More Things That I Liked    * The chemistry between the two leads, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. I still cannot get over just how strong their said chemistry was. Going into this, I had no idea what the movie was about or what to even  expect...but, from their first encounter on, these two actors equally radiate the screen--and show us exactly what great acting is all about. I am not usually interested in strictly romantic films--however, from their aforementioned first \\"chance\\" meeting in the men's room, and all throughout the film, I found myself strongly wanting the two to be together by movie's end in a way that reminded me of James Stewart and Kim Novak in Vertigo. Just two great performances.    * Emily Blunt. She completely radiates the screen as Elise. Now granted, I am attracted to \\"arty-type\\" girls to begin with, but wow...her role as a feisty, completely self-assured, free-spirited ballet dancer just captivated me. And, did I mention she looks gorgeous?    Side note: I have wondered if my \\"captivation\\" is due to the fact I also (big mrroland secret here) would like to dance, myself, if I could (being a 6'4\\", 220 lbs. klutz doesn't lend itself very well to dancing).    * The movie's supporting cast. No matter how good a movie's leads are, it cannot be a great film unless theyare surrounding by an exceptional cast. This is certainly the case here as Michael Kelly, Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and (another \\"incomparable\\") Terence Stamp all turn in their usual fine performances. There is one scene in particular with Mr. Stamp that I especially noted: After a romantic interlude between David and Elise, they lie in bed asleep...with Terence Stamp's character, Thompson, unbeknownst to them, gazing down hauntingly at them. A great, yet (more than a bit) eerie, visual.    * The movie's pacing. What can I say about this...other than everything is done right. Director George Nolfi expertly sets up the first meeting between our two leads, then continues to let the movie play out at a perfect pace...right up to the film's climax. The movie's action never feels rushed, yet the suspense level is on \\"High\\" throughout the film. It never lets up. Another great job.    * I also very much enjoyed the movie's score. It is composed by Thomas Newman (The Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty) and lends itself well to the movie's suspense, haunting visuals and pacing. In short, it does what it is supposed to do: it helps make the movie great.    * Finally, I appreciate the fact that, despite Matt Damon's character being a politician, the movie mostly avoids politics and agenda and instead concentrates on storytelling. I watch movies purely for entertainment and escapism, and do not want to be \\"preached\\" to--even if I agree with what they are \\"preaching.\\" This movie, thankfully--and to its credit, leaves the politics \\"at home.\\"    The DVD    Extras include:    * Deleted and Extended Scenes. There is no \\"special edition\\" present where these extra scenes are inserted seamlessly into the actual movie, but they do add to your viewing enjoyment and better understanding of this movie's story--and just what exactly the film's director and producers were trying to say.    * Three Featurettes: Leaping Through New York, Destined To Be and Becoming Elise.    Leaping Through New York is a brief (7:37) look at the making of the film, in particular, how they achieved the \\"teleporting\\" special effects. Lots of making-of footage--shot on location in The City--is also shown, with Matt Damon summing it all up by saying visually, \\"the movie is a love letter to New York.\\"    Destined To Be is a short (4:52) featurette that discusses the movie's theme of fate versus free will, with both leads discussing how far (are) their characters willing to go to be together--and what happens when you defy fate, itself.    Becoming Elise (7:07)--yes, this was of great interest to me. It discusses Emily Blunt's preparation for her role of Elise (as a dancer) and describes the dance training (and diet) she underwent as she \\"became\\" the character of Elise. I was amazed at just how much dance training she went through, especially considering that her on-screen \\"dance time,\\" by comparison, is not very long at all.    * Lastly, we get an excellent commentary from Director George Nolfi. This, as film commentaries go, is outstanding. He discusses special effects; the movie's shooting in and around NYC; the chemistry between the film's two leads; (and) the movie's themes. This is arguably the best film commentary I have ever heard (definitely on my short list) and a \\"must-listen\\" for all fans of this movie.    So, in conclusion    I (easily) rate this film with five very strong stars. Along with The Avengers, this was the best movie I have seen this year (2012). It is so strange: I had never heard of this movie when it was in development, nor when it was playing in the theaters. It was only sheer chance that I happened upon it on a lazy Friday afternoon. I am just so very glad I did finally see it--and I have to ask myself two questions:    * How did I not notice--considering it grossed $127,869,379 dollars worldwide--this film (much) earlier?    * Considering my ignorance of this film's existence, how exactly did I ever manage to notice this film at all--couldit have been...fate?    Thank you for reading.

B00A77II0U|5.0|Another Phenominal Game by Alawar! Definitely worth the $,I wish every game was like this! Great on Kindle Fire! Way more then just a hidden object game!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I really liked this book.  Sometimes in a series, the second book disappoints, but not in this case.  The character development continued to be as good as in the first, and the linkages between the characters and next generation were done well.  I am looking forward to book three!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book because it was one of the Amazon Daily Deals. I look at the daily deals that are rated with 4 stars, but automatically buy the 5 star ones (except for Romance or Horror). I generally like Mysteries the best, but read a few top sellers and Science Fiction or Fantasy when my kids recommend it. This is a book that surprised me. The writing was great, the story line was excellent, and the pace was good. I especially liked that a young female was such a strong character in the story. I highly recommend this book.
0470913029|2.0|Good book but wish it had more recipies; not a book i'm probably going to sit and read cover to cover

1400067820|4.0|I happened to notice that Nicholas Taleb was speaking at my public library last night. He seems to live in my town.  I hope folks mind that I haven't read the book - but I feel I got the gist of where he is coming from.  I also hope people don't mind a bit of my personal story in here - I feel it will  help folks see how I'm assessing the guy.<br />In my old Wall Street style ( I haven't worked there for years but every so often...) I went up to him and said both forcefully/seriously and humorously (so as always to leave people with a way to back away, \\"Could you give me a 30 second preview.?\\"  He didn't seem to understand me or didn't want to.  He might have understood me if I had told him I hadn't read any of his books but I felt that would be rude!<br />I bristled during the first part of his speech, noticing that I felt jealous of his success (!)  - he seemed to be making sweeping conclusions about the 2008 crash. I'm all for blaming Greenspan for keeping interest rates low too long , but I'm not sure that the  Fed was trying to manage stability so much as growth - in the absence of tech growth after the 2000 dot com and telecom crash.<br />But I started to warm up to him during his talk. He made a self deprecating comment about how he was a professor of risk engineering at NYU, as if to say how absurd that title is. He only talked for 20 minutes and then opened things up for Q&A for the rest of the hour. He knows several languages and speaks Hebrew - I liked that as I am involved in Torah study. He sometimes had trouble expressing himself in English. He didn't seem to want to talk much about financial markets , and especially wanted to avoid the `what do we do now' conversation. He wanted to talk about medicine. And that was a good thing, because my gut tells me that his thesis is much stronger on medicine (and there is much more data to validate it) than it is on finance.  His discussion of overtreatment of hypertension, cholesterol  seemed right on.<br />Reviewers have found him sarcastic, condescending and bombastic. He did seem to delight in shocking people but in a respectful and friendly way. During the Q&A one elderly gentleman stood up and said `I was a bit shocked if not stressed by your thesis that technology precedes science and not the other way around'.  I dont really remember his answer that well except to say it sounded plausible but probably wrong :)<br />During the Q&A, a surgeon stood up and said ` I wonder whether people know who is treating them. Surgery is taught now the way pilots are taught. Errors are not tolerated. Surgery has become completely bureaucratized.'<br />After the session I spoke for a few minutes to a very smart guy who was originally from Israel and ran a shipping business -he told me that young people he hires comes to them with spreadsheets and `I can find 25 problems with them in a minute'.  This for me  validating and illustrated Taleb's idea that theory today too often trumps the practical , that analysts in finance and the military etc  use analytic models like video games, and that tinkering and trial and error. I mentioned the failure of the quants in 2008 to a woman who just happened to be a fixed income trader, and she told me she really valued how early in her career, when things were slow on the trading desk her boss would rapid fire questions at them which they were supposed to try to answer without a calculator or knowing the duration of the bonds - (duration is similar to maturity and measures price sensitivity to interest rates) - suppose the market goes down 50 basis points in an hour, what would you do? Where would these bonds go? She agreed when I said `I guess you can approximate duration in your head.'<br />Several people were standing around talking to him. Since when my wife is mad at me she tries to make me take antidepressants, I took a 5 sec pause as an opportunity to say `what do you think about Prozac'. He said it shouldn't exist.  I asked him about numbers to treat in antidepressants but he was distracted by an email from a geneticist.<br />On the whole a well spent hour - I liked the man although i found him a bit inaccessible (what should i expect with people crowding around him?) I just ordered the book and will add more after i've read it.

1451695195|5.0|This book was highly recommended and I was not disappointed!  Although I've read a lot about NDEs, this account is different, but oh, so believable.  Dr. Alexander wasn't even a spiritual man before he had this experience.  Now he hopes to share his message with others.  Sometimes his descriptions of brain activity got a bit technical, but oh so necessary for all the scientific readers out there!  I bought extra books to give as gifts.  Everyone that reads it loves it.
B0090O07RS|5.0|One of the greatest bands. One of the greatest performances. And in high-definition. What else can anybody want? Every fan of classic rock n' roll should have a copie of this.
B000CNE092|2.0|Both discs are considerably scratched up, much more than I had expected, and freezes about 7 minutes in, so that the whole movie cannot be watched.
B004G600A4|5.0|If anyone is interested in a good romantic comedy -- forget &#34;good&#34;, &#34;hilarious&#34; would be a better term, this movie has it all!  I'm a guy, male, and I don't normally like romantic comedies.  There are very few I would watch more than once.  But this one, I've seen 3x in the three weeks since I first bought it.  Something I DO enjoy in movies is humor.  I'm less into romance, but I do like humor.  And this movie does well with the romance and very well with the humor, in my estimation, so I'm very happy.<br /><br />Now enough of this gushing review.<br /><br />I normally don't review movies either, but this one is special.
B003MUSV9W|5.0|My daughter will love this!  Especially the Italian scenes and language will be cool  since she's learning the language. Cia!

B009AMALGM|2.0|Since its inception in 2007, the Paranormal Activity series has led the pack of<br /><br />suspenseful horror films. Paranormal Activity, the first installation of the series, was a<br /><br />huge success and considered one of the scariest movies to date. This brought on a huge<br /><br />surge of knock offs and wanna-bes. However, the Paranormal Activity series continued to<br /><br />distinguish its self from the crowd, until now.<br /><br />I personally have been a huge fan of the Paranormal Activity series, and have even<br /><br />been satisfied by some of the spin offs that spawned from it. However, Paranormal Activity<br /><br />4 has thoroughly disappointed me. As with many other genres, there are only so many<br /><br />different types of stories to make a film from. This is certainly true for supernatural horror<br /><br />films. Paranormal Activity 4 marks the end of new ideas in this genre.<br /><br />The film is a sequel to the second movie of the series and picks up with seemingly all<br /><br />new characters. The movie focuses around Alex (Kathryn Newton), her boyfriend Ben<br /><br />(Matt Shively) and Alex's little brother Wyatt. The movie starts to take the expected turn<br /><br />when Alex's family lets the strange child from across the street stay at their house for a few<br /><br />days. From here on the plot starts unfolding and strange things start happening around the<br /><br />house as Robbie and Wyatt start talking to an imaginary friend. Of course, Alex's parents<br /><br />try to explain everything with logic and child's play.<br /><br />As in the other three movies of the series, stationary cameras, equipped with night<br /><br />vision, are mounted around the house to catch any evidence of unexplained happenings.<br /><br />Luxon<br />The director, Henry Joost, does a good job in wowing the viewers with a cool effect on one<br /><br />of the stationary cameras. Ben shows Alex and the boys a cool trick using the Xbox Kinect<br /><br/>and the infrared night vision. The Xbox device emits thousands of little infrared dots to<br /><br />capture motion, and the night vision camera sees all these dots making for a very cool high<br /><br />tech effect. This effect allows for the imaginary friend to be seen in a blurry human-like<br /><br />figure of dots.<br /><br />Although, the movie has the added Kinect effect, they dropped a seemingly<br /><br />insignificant part of the stationary camera aspect that made the first three movies great. In<br /><br />the other three films, while nothing spooky was going on in the footage from the cameras<br /><br />was fast-forwarded, as shown by a time stamp. When something was about to happen,<br /><br />it would play at a normal speed, indicating you needed to pay close attention. This little<br /><br />detail was not present in the fourth movie as a result a feeling of suspense and hyper focus<br /><br />was lost. The movie further deviated from its predecessors with less actual paranormal<br /><br />activity and too much focus on Robbie and Wyatt talking to a wall. While disturbing and<br /><br />unsettling it doesn't have a scare factor that the other movies had.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 4 does have some good jump frights though. One of the first<br /><br />is when Alex wanders into Robbie's house to find Wyatt. Alex is startled as Robbie's<br /><br />mother, Katie (Katie Featherston) appears behind her out of nowhere. Fans of the series<br /><br />recognize Katie as the star of the first movie, with significant appearances in the other two<br /><br />as well. Her arrival in the fourth movie was cleverly done and made the light bulb go off in<br /><br />viewer's heads. This loose connection between movies is a strong suit of the series and is<br /><br />maintained in the number four. As the story unfolds, it allows for all the pieces to be put<br /><br />together and the series takes shape as a whole.<br /><br />Luxon<br />Shortly after Katie's appearance, the movie starts speeding up; I would say too<br /><br />fast. Knifes are thrown by invisible forces, chandeliers break, chairs move around, toys<br /><br />malfunction. Alex becomes extremely concerned and fears for her life. Katie and Robbie<br /><br />show strange interest in Wyatt and even start to call him by a different name. By the time,<br /><br />Alex and her parents catch on things have escalated beyond their control.<br /><br />The final scenes and ending seem rather quick and abrupt but still yield many<br /><br />screams from the crowd. The ending has little or no ties to the rest of the story that I could<br /><br />tell. As the final scene faded to black and the credits rolled, my viewing partner both had<br /><br />the feeling of \\"that's it?\\" The build up and action all went by so quickly you feel like there<br /><br />should be something left to watch.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with high hopes of a decent ending to<br /><br />the story. This movie will still get you to jump and scream, but doesn't have you on the<br /><br />edge of your seat for 90 minutes like the other three. This movie struck disappointment in<br /><br />me, but it is still much better than most of the supernatural movies out today. My advice:<br /><br />wait for it to come to Netflix.
0385535147|3.0|I'm still waiting for a read as good as his early books, still The Racketeer is a good story told by a great story teller. Always have loved Grisham's character development. You have to like Mal and what's not to like about a lawyer in jail?
0425263908|3.0|First off, I am not sure who wrote their book first - E.L. James or Sylvia Day. I am ok with the intimate parts being the same, but Gideon and Christian are way too similar. It's seems like this story is a tweek from Fifty Shades - which is not so creative in my opinion. The writing is fine, the scenes steamy and the flow of the story easy to understand and follow. I guess if I didn't read Fifty Shades of Grey first, I would have liked this book more.<br /><br />But, I did purchase Reflected to You. It was still similar, but the story was shifting a bit. I found it more enjoyable and exciting. I will still read Entwined to You when it comes out in May.  I have a thing for Gideon now :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, couldn't put it down.  Purchased this book for my iPad as soon as I finished reading Hunger Games.  Excellent series.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|Great music to just have on as background music.  This is kind of &#34;new agey&#34; type stuff but the vocalist is quite good.  The songs are catchy and fun to listen to.  I'm happy with this purchase.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I read all the reviews prior to purchasing this case and I have not had any of the problems the negative reviews cited. Yes, I mounted the device in &#34;upside down&#34; in order to have access to the charging port while the cover is closed, but that has not affected it's use. This case came as advertised and I am satisfied with my purchase.
1423101502|4.0|When I began reading the Percy Jackson series, I found it to be inventive, engaging, and delightful. It was wonderfully imaginative, and the implementation of Greek mythology in a modern setting worked very well. But as the series continued, I felt that it was slowly losing all the positive attributes that had previously made it such joy to read. It began to drag on and take itself far too seriously for a series that had previously been so fun. At times, I almost felt that the author and publisher were simply trying to milk the initial success of the series for as much as they could, by bloating the content of Percy's adventures.<br /><br />But with Book Five, Riordan has redeemed himself, and brought the story arc to an exciting, satisfying end. It was nonstop action from the very beginning, which could be a bit silly at times, but for the most part works great to move the story along at a breakneck pace. Riordan threw the kitchen sink into this one, summoning a cornucopia of gods, titans, monsters, and downright strange critters (like a giant, rampaging cow, for instance). It's hardly one of the best books I've ever read (it still takes itself far too seriously for a story with such absurd and wild concepts), but it was enjoyable, and I was very happy to see Riordan rescue Percy's tale from the depths of mediocrity, and restore him to a respectable conclusion.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Read Bared to You and didn't find it very original. It was too close to Fifty Shades of Grey....<br /><br />Reflected to You was still similar in certain areas, but the twist and turns this book took made it more exciting to read. I am now hooked onto Gideon and am looking forward to Entwined By You in May.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the final book.  Overall this was an excellent series.  Could not put any of these books down.  I wish there were more.

B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Bought my wife the d5000 kit and was surprised that one of the lenses didn't come with a shade. Bought this shade, fit her lens. Works great. Fits facing outward or backward on the lens. She can shoot either way. It's a little tricky getting it on and off but you get used to it and eventually it's a non-issue.<br /><br />Great Nikon product

B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I received this book from Simon & Schuster through NetGalley and rated it 4.5 stars.<br /><br />In the summer of 1961 Laurel is sixteen years old and hiding out in a tree-house while her family is having a birthday picnic near by. She is dreaming about a boy she's met, her plans for the future and reluctant to interrupt her private thoughts in order to join her family in the festivities. Her peace and quiet come to a shocking end though when an unknown man walks up to their house, where he encounters Laurel's mother who is carrying both her two year old son and a knife to slice the birthday cake with. The next thing Laurel sees is the man reaching for her brother followed by her mother raising the knife and stabbing the man. Although Laurel gives evidence to the police, the shocking killing is never revealed to her siblings and not mentioned again. And soon Laurel leaves home to pursue her dreams and although she never forgets what she saw, the memories fade into the background.<br />Fifty years later Laurel's mother, Dorothy, is ninety years old and dying. The realisation that she will soon lose the last of her parents and any opportunity she ever had of discovering what exactly happened that day in the past and why, Laurel sets out on a quest to uncover her mother's past and the events that lead to the killing. Because Laurel has always known more about the incident than she revealed to the police at the time. She knows that her mother knew the man she killed. And now she needs to know who the man was, why he scared her mother enough for her to raise that knife and, most importantly, if her mother really is the wonderful woman she has always known or some stranger with a secret and possibly horrible past. Laurel's quest will take her to the first years of World War II, a young woman with big dreams and even bigger disappointments and a remarkable revelation.<br /><br />This book was pretty much what I expected it to be. A very well written exploration of a secret past. As in Morton's previous books she takes a mysterious and secret event that has happened a long time ago and has one character slowly but carefully uncover the threads that lead to a solution that is both credible and completely unexpected. And as always, she does it very well.<br /><br />The same can be said for Kate Morton's characters. There are no one-dimensional characters in her books. All of them have their good and their bad qualities, none of them are completely likable or hateful and quite a few of them are not at all what they at first seem to be. This makes for both a more believable story and a very satisfying reading experience. With the characters as well as the story-line being unpredictable the reader is kept guessing until the very end. They may think they know what happened and what the final revelation will look like, but they are almost certainly going to be wrong. Just when everything appears to have been revealed, the author has one or two further surprises in store for her readers. Surprises that bring the story to a, for me, very satisfying conclusion; one that brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />I know I will continue to read Kate Morton's books as long as she keeps on writing them.past.

B002N4DZ08|5.0|What a performance. Why I waited so long to have it is beyond me, because it is a revelation. Recorded when her voice no longer could hit the stratosphere, her artistry had only deepened. Just listen to the seduction scene in Act Two (with the castanets). Other sopranos take the erotically curling &#34;la la la la la ......&#34; line seamlessly, all in the same flowing color. Not Callas. She breaks up every phrase, all to dramatic effect. One part can be light, the next phrase smoky, the next a different tone, all suggesting facets of sexuality and momentum. Astonishing.<br /><br />She occupies the part from start to finish. Her profound musical intelligence never fails. And Georges Pretre's conducting nails every rhythm, every phrase. All in the cast are up to the challenge.<br /><br />It is not for nothing that Maria Callas, with that problematic yet compelling voice, is considered a genius. She is never 'background' music. If it's 'pretty' you're after, go elsewhere. If you want the truth, here it it. Callas demands that you listen, as she said, with your soul and ears.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Entertaining - I would rate it second to the original with Men in Black II coming in last in the ranking.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I reed every Grisham book and usually cannot put it down until finished. This book enjoyable was not that gripping and I felt lost in the middle. The end tied together the entire book, but left me disappointed and confused how all fit together.
B00006AW2G|1.0|This album is generally insufferable, how lazy could the boys be ripping off the title from the Beatles. Only ever gave this a listen after the Stones got big around 1990 when I decided to go back and dig up some of their early indie stuff. Steel Wheels rolls this one over anyday.
B008GANNIC|4.0|there is a lot of preaching in this album, lots of good music but the lyrics make me cringe a bit.

B00267QOEQ|5.0|Another great Adam Sandler movie! Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh! We watch it a lot!
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I give this movie a 4 1/2 stars, but I'll round up to 5 because of the all the bandwagon haters that are giving this movie ONE star just because they're pretentious hipsters that whine \\"BUT THE ORIGINAL WAS BETTER!!!\\". Really?! The original was better? Even so, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS MOVIE WAS A ONE STAR PRODUCTION YOU IMBECILES!<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that the demographic they were trying to market to seem to have this irrational grudge against the new Total Recall. I believe this movie is NOT a remake. This movie is a RE-IMAGINING. One LARGE piece of evidence that supports my claim is that the story is TOTALLY different from the original. So you can't really call it a remake. It's a re-imagining. Sure, it's the same basic premise, but the two movies are so different you can't compare them which is what many of the bad reviewers seem to be doing.<br /><br />In all the reviews giving this movie below 3 stars are all whining about the same thing: \\"the original was better.\\" That's the fatal flaw in their review. They set themselves up for failure when watching this movie if they were expecting a 1990's Total Recall with better graphics.<br /><br />There is NO WAY in hell this movie deserves ONE star. I mean just LOOK at it. This is NOT a one star film. It's AT LEAST a 3 star film. It's a clean production. Good graphics, gripping story, good acting, nice twist =! one star. Sure, the plot is a little shallow but that doesn't make the movie one star.<br /><br />Anyone that gives this movie one star is just a butthurt idiot that is oblivious to their hipster jealousy by saying \\"the original was better\\". Get over yourself and just enjoy the movie for what it is: a graphically spectacular straight forward sci-fi movie.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|Must watch; great movie! I really thought it was about a woman who seduces married men but it's so much more than that. There is a secret that the woman holds and as you continue to watch the movie, you'll really do see more than just a seductress!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never been so moved by a book before. I started rereading it as soon as I finished because I already missed the characters. It's just as good the second time around.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not a bad book.  The only complaint I had was the first person point of view.  I haven't read many books in that point of view.

0345803485|4.0|What I can write about this book that hasn't already been written? The sheer volume of reviews is an example that the book affects the reader and it has had an impact on our society whether it is a positive or negative reaction. I admit that I understood Readers who pan the book and found it hard to give it even one star yet I am also on board with Readers who like the book and were happy to score it five stars.<br /><br />For those readers who found the book unbelievable, how can you possible disagree? Christian Grey is a college dropout who by the age of 26 is a billionaire who speaks two languages, pilots his own helicopter, plays the piano like a professional and he is so physically perfect that women can barely string a sentence together in his presence. Then, we add his goal to end world hunger and develop solar-powered tools to be used in third world countries and he doesn't even patent this new technology. He may own dozens of businesses and achieve his lofty goals but he has all the time in the world for the woman, Ana, who has captured his heart.<br /><br />Christian Grey is pure fantasy but who says he cannot exist within the pages of book? Can't we chose to read to escape reality?  Yes, there is the annoying downside by the author's need to repeat certain phases over and over throughout the book.  I'm surprised a talented editor didn't manage to improve on that flaw.  Of course,  this book isn't a classical masterpiece but I'm not ashamed to admit I enjoyed reading the entire trilogy. I compare it to buying a lottery ticket. For the one dollar price of a ticket until the lottery drawing, I have earned the right to dream of life where I have millions of dollars and my imagination can go on overdrive. For the price of buying Fifty of Shades of Grey, you can temporarily live in a world where love is the first and only priority but as a result of Christian's demons the currency between Christian and Ana is sex and that never truly ever changes.<br /><br />I suspect a movie made based on this book will be a disappointment. I don't think it possible to find a male actor who could portray all the sides of the almost perfect Christian Grey so I think it is a mistake to even try.suspect a movie made based on this book will be a disappointment.

B009YU62H2|5.0|When I heard Soundgarden released their first new studio album in 16 years, I admit I cringed at first. I wondered it Chris Cornell's voice would sound \\"old and tired\\". I wondered if it would be even remotely close to the quality of \\"[[ASIN:B000VZX8J4 Badmotorfinger]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B000002G2B Superunknown]]\\". I'm excited to say that I believe \\"King Animal\\" is on par with both of these classic albums, and easily surpasses \\"Down on the Upside\\" in overall rock energy and creative melody and harmony. One of the things I always loved about Soundgarden is their ability to create LONG albums full of great material that made you want to listen all the way through, and that's exactly what they've done here. Oh yeah - Chris Cornell's voice sounds AMAZING. If you're a Soundgarden fan, trust me - you won't be disappointed. Or if you're just looking for an excellent album that ROCKS (something VERY rare these days), you'll love it. One of the best rock albums of 2012 - period.

B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. Released in June 1967, Rolling Stone called it \\"the most important rock & roll album ever made ... by the greatest rock & roll group of all time.\\" ~Wikipedia<br /><br />This CD is absolutely one of the most fun, relaxing, beautiful, happy-making and lovely albums that I've ever bought. Without fail, sorrow flies out the window when the songs are played. The music itself is melodic and beautiful and the especially interesting sounds flow from the use of an assortment of really wild instruments: rhythm and acoustic guitars; piano and Hammond organ; harmonica, tape loops, sound effects and comb and tissue paper; handclaps, tambourine and maracas, harpsichord, harmonium, Lowry organ and glockenspiel; sitar and more (if you can believe it). You will either love it (like most people) or dislike it (there is a minority who just don't like the album). Almost every song on this album is lyrical and tells a beautiful, albeit sometimes disjointed, dreamy, or sad, story. Happy listening~*

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I was given a copy of this book for review by the publisher:<br /><br />I held onto my hat with every turn of the page, trying to will Harold Fry with all my might towards his destination in this beautiful novel by Rachel Joyce. Tender and funny, this book was a wonderful read. Joyce crafted characters who will stay with long after you read the final chapter. Lovely!

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|The Movie was clean, perfect condition and came early! Love this movie. Although I did come in the package for my car alarm, both came together with seperate shipping dont know if this is normal but It came and I love it so does not matter.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I feel the title is misleading as the weight loss he talks about comes not only from cutting out wheat , but from following a low carb diet similar to Atkins and other gurus out there. I got various ideas from it worth following up, and am curious about old varieties of wheat. The author suggests that our sensitivity to wheat stems from the new varieties developed through selective hybridisation over the last half century. Logically it would follow that old varieties may not be a problem, but apart from a personal story of his reaction to an old variety of wheat and modern wheat, there is no discussion of this. I read the book quickly and will probably not go back to it, except perhaps to follow up a web link on old varieties of wheat.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|Classic movie to enjoy with your kids and grandkids over & over again...hard to believe this movie has been out for so long!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Never a disappointment!  Always great choises!  I can always find a game to make my time full of fun and chalanges!
0060107081|2.0|I'm not going to waste my time writing a well planned review of this. I'll just say it's a classic case of \\"trying too hard.\\" Too literary. Too feminist. Too much death and PMS. Overly packed with symbolism until it's no longer fun to read, but simply beating you over the head with a message. I'm sure many readers will claim that we \\"needed\\" a book like this in 1979--the same year that Gilbert and Gubar published \\"The Madwoman in the Attic\\"-- but The Bloody Chamber just doesn't hold up today. Everything this book attempts to do has probably been better done since, with more art and subtlety. I suspect this was also the inspiration for Ann Rice's Sleeping Beauty Trilogy a few years later, and Carter's collection of short stories is only slightly better than Rice's sadomasochistic pornography. (And just in case you're wondering, I'm no relation to Angela Carter, thankfully.)

B004SUWR2C|3.0|Don't get me wrong I love UNO, who doesn't? After having to setup my account in order to play uno online against other players I was able to connect with my friends on Facebook and play against them.<br /><br />What I don't like is that UNO is constantly running in the background.  You manually have to go in and stop the service.  it's silly that this game always  connected to the Internet, running in the background, and using my system resources.<br /><br />I rated this app 3 stars because I feel once you exit out of the game it should kill the service I will gladly change my review to 5 stars wants the programmers to decide to fix this service and make it stop running once I exit the game.

B008FYZIVY|1.0|Greetings fellow amazonians I am now back and in full swing at the carnival so I wanted to give the other carnies some edutainment. I picked up downton abbey because it was my grandmothers favorite show (she would always drink brandy and yell at the tv when it was on). Well I invited the whole crew, the freaks, the pigiron men, the straight acts and my fellow barkers. It started well enough the first episode went quickly and everybody was having a good time. Then mongo ran out of popcorn and all hell broke loose. He started yelling that he could not understand the actors and he asked why was I making them watch some foreign film. I told him it was the queens english and he should watch his tongue. This upset some of the pigiron men because apparently they thought we were still enemies of the british and they said I was trying to brainwash them. At this point everybody started yelling and throwing bottles of beer around my trailer so I got up on my kitchen table and asked them all very politely to leave. At this point someone called me a communist and hit me in eye with a corona bottle. Now im laying on my back writing this on my phone with a frozen steak over my right eye. Thanks amazon!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great movie.  Leaves you wanting the next installment.  Obviously a prequel to the Alien series.  It will be fun to watch how subsequent movies develop.
B00913DPW2|1.0|The game is not a user friendly for the Galaxy S3. You can't get very far. Can't figure out how to use the inventory. I finally gave up
B005VPRETE|5.0|Perfect for my daughter (5 years old) and any lego loving girly girl :). Thanks Lego for thinking of us!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Merida is not your typical princess.  She's more comfortable hunting with her bow and arrow, then she is wearing fancy dresses.  Merida is not keen when her parents decide to give her hand away in marriage, and an argument breaks out between her and her mother.  I don't want to give away any more of the plot, but I highly recommend Brave.  It was a very touching story of a girl who wants to be independent and trying to get her parents to accept that independence, especially her mother.  There were a lot of things said between mother and daughter and it reminded me of my own mother-daughter situation.  Go along for the ride with Merida, you won't be sorry.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I really hated getting my headphone wires tangled on my chair arm - it was driving me nuts.<br />So I got these, figuring they would be an upgrade all around.<br /><br />To be honest, upgrading from a $40 Sennheiser USB wired, the sound difference didn't impress me that much.<br />Its got this 'hollow' quality to it, only way I can describe it - but its fine, just set expectations accordingly.<br /><br />I was *much* more impressed the first time I played BF2 with an X-Fi card and regular headphones.<br /><br />Yes you can wear these for hours on end, the battery life if very good, for over the ear they are surprisingly light and comfortable, you can charge them while listening.<br /><br />These work equally well with Windows 7 and 8, as well as Mac - although with Mac they just operate as normal wireless headphones.<br /><br />Here are some pros and cons, but alot of them are specific to my personal needs and won't relate to anyone else:<br /><br />1. I don't like them for VOIP calling like Skype - because they block out so much sound, you can't hear yourself speaking, and its distracting when using voip. They are also a little much form factor wise if you are taking a business video call - and for gods sakes make sure the voice changer is off if you are on a business call!! I actually unwittingly had an entire Microsoft support call where the Indian call center was having trouble understanding me - when the call was over, I realized I was a CHIPMUNK the whole time! Poor guy.<br /><br />2. The USB transmitter doesn't seem to work via a powered USB 2.0 hub, or at least not reliably. This is a problem as I have 2 Macs and a PC and use a USB switch. I must pull the transmitter and plug it into the machine I want.<br /><br />3. The usb jack is VERY tight, and you have to pull it very hard when its done charging. I guess this is by design so it doesnt fall out while charging and listening.<br /><br />4. The voice changer feature is cool, but I wish it would come with some voices that sounded normal, just not like me. They are novelty voices like chipmunks and aliens, some of which are not very understandable and therefore not usable while gaming. You can buy and download others from the company that makes the technology, but the process was too confusing.<br /><br />4. Although I dont think about it when gaming, because I am immersed, when wearing them while not gaming they are a bit burdensome, overall I could probably do without all the 7.1 etc features and be fine with an open-ear stereo headset like I've always used.<br /><br />5. These are very, very good at blocking out ambient noise.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|One of my favorite movies by far, Trucker & Dale vs Evil is simply a good time.  Not what you think, but an all around great movie with plenty of action and laughs.
0316067601|4.0|Inspiring story of courage and will power.  Reminds us to pray for our fallen heros( yes, they still need our prayers-for all catholics out there, you know what I am talking about).  Encourages me to live MY life for GOD and country.  Great Book, just wish and pray that all writers may recognize thet don't have to use curse words to convey their point.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This show is by FAR the best TV show ever. Claire Danes is a superb actress and Mandy Patankin rules!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My children love this movie, as do I.  We all can't wait year after year to watch this movie at Christmas time.  It is very family friendly and has a great message.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The watch works as it's supposed to.  Mine runs about 12 sec slower per day.  For a quartz watch, I hardly adjust time before the battery runs out in two years.  Good thing for this watch is you do not need a new battery every few years.  The watch looks nice and feels a bit of weight.  You can see mechanical movement through tranparent glass on the back.  It's sort of cool.
B00846REIS|5.0|As a fan of 50 Shades, I loved Bared to you....not quite as racy but a much better story, which I really liked.  Just sorry I have to wait until May for book #3!!  I would highly recommend it to anyone who loved 50 Shades!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Gives you a lot to think about. The author also gives other publications to support his views. His views, from a medical experts prospective, give validity to his story. From my christian viewpoint, the writing re-inforces my view on the life after death.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|I caught Season 1 premier on Public Television. The story was intense, enigmatic and unexpected. I honestly became a supporter of Public TV just to purchase [[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock: Season One]]. Worth it. Season 2 continues the everlasting bro-mance of Sherlock and John with even more suspense and intensity. Classic Holmes stories (The Hounds of Baskervilles, Scandal in Belgravia) modernized and riveting. The writing is superbly twisty and keeps one guessing, hoping that they can figure out the details before the world's only consulting detective. Not likely. Benedict Cumberbatch IS Sherlock in all his intensity, arrogance and honesty, while his right-hand man John Watson, played by the incomparable Martin Freeman, remains the perfect balance of fierce loyalty, intelligence and understanding nature. Can't wait for season 3! Considering moving to UK just so I can see it when it airs. #hooked

B0072OFOM6|4.0|I wasn't going to buy this series cause I was pretty bummed that Andy Whitfield died and he did such a great job, I didn't think they could replace him.  Well, they didn't but this series is still very well done and after you get over the fact that it's not Andy you'll enjoy it.

B0073LWEXK|2.0|READ THIS REVIEW.  WARNING THIS REVIEW SPOILS GAME.  READ IT.  it was fun but it had no purpose.  all you do is return the city to its original state of being.  that is it.  is say you returned the city back to normal and your grandmother will be so happy.

B0030V0PEW|5.0|LOVED this book.  Although it's not exactly a step-by-step guide on when and how to create checklists, the book absolutely won me over to the value of using simple checklists both personally and professionally.  I've already seen basic errors from the people I manage at work drop significantly as a result of the checklists we have implemented in a couple of key business areas.<br /><br />Jack Dorsey at Square (also co-founder of Twitter) gives this book to every new hire.  That alone should tell you how valuable the information contained herein is.<br /><br />Read this book.

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This movie is nice entertainment.  I felt that the director tried to cover too many issues but the movie is well done.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I like the first book. This one was just more of the same without even getting anywhere. I don't think they resolved anything. Gideon is still closed up and unwilling to share. Maybe #3 will be better?
B005HSG3U6|3.0|I really like this case. it keeps my Kindle FIre in place and safe.<br />Only negative thing is its White and get a little dirty.<br />Overall its a good hard case..
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I love the newer superhero movies that are grounded in a more realistic reality.  This, the big screen debut of the character Iron Man, is fantastic.  I love the build up, showing how Tony Stark goes thru the process of becoming Iron Man.  About the only thing I didn't really care too much for was the \\"big battle\\" at the end. I thought it a little to by the numbers, but quibbles aside, this movie is the start (along with The Incredible Hulk) of the Avengers series.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Doubt is a well made movie.  I caution viewers to hold on to their beliefs.  This movie is for entertainment only and should not be viewed as judgement on the Church.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Love all the songs on this CD, Jennifer Hudson in an incredible singer and the entire CD is entertaining.<br />Worth Buying.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I was hooked on this book after reading the first paragraph of the Kindle Sample I had sent to my Kindle Fire. I don't normally pay twelve dollars for fiction. I enjoyed this book very much. It has been a long time since a book so captured my mind, that I was thinking of the protaganist during the day.<br /><br />I was in true suspense during the book. Most of the time in other novels, the pieces of the puzzle boringly come together in my mind one-half to three-quarters into the story. I truly HAD to read to the very end to connect all the dots. I was blown away. It seemed like the author took a sharp left and was never coming back to the conclusion of the story. But, it worked!<br /><br />Some have of our fellow esteemed readers have commented that this book is not Mr. Grisham's best work. In a way, I'm glad. I loved this book so very much, that if this is a sample of sub-par work, I am looking forward to reading every one of his other books.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great little app that`s making note taking between computer and tablet a whole lot easier. I love that everything is right there wherever I might be! I find it especially useful for recording those little moments with the kids for project life and have also found it very helpful for keeping class notes with me and organized. Basically it does everything I need it to do and then some!
B000NV6E7E|5.0|I have read many of her books, but this was my favorite<br />Just a great read  - not many writers like this anymore

1608871517|4.0|Quite an interesting look at the ideas behind's Michael choice of clothing and why he tried to achieve the looks. I haven't read this anywhere else.  The author is very credible as he personally created the clothing for 25 years. Love this book. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that the physical book itself is not as high quality as I would have liked to see in a coffee table book. The pages don't lay perfectly flat and I'm not sure the binding is strong as it should be. It was manufactured in China.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It has a lot of problems but the most anoying ones are that people can hear you when your making a phone call by speaker phone and the sensitivity on the screen. I don't recommend it. My wife had it for 3 days and now we are trying to return it.
B009ZQI41C|5.0|Hello,<br />After watching the Downton Abbey season 3 episode 0 2 minute preview I got a message to review the item.  No offense intended but I don't in general review previews.

0670022705|5.0|Excellent perspectives on the history of humankind through the ages.  Amazing how the author builds on the objects themselves to enlighten the reader about the context in which the artifacts were made.  He deftly makes the importance of each object crystal clear in layman's terms.  Easy to segment reading since each chapter is 4-5 pages long, allowing one to read the book over time in a leisurely way.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was the best book I have read in years, and the first book since \\"Catcher In The Rye\\" that I have finished in 24 hours since I was back in high school in 1975. I confess to being biased as I live in Collingswood, and I am a die hard Eagles fan but I also am dealing with a child with depression so this was an amazing experience and I would recommend to anyone, even if you hate sports. Almost do not want to see the movie, as what I have heard so far it strays from the book, and the book was perfect.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It was a good book but when your able to read a Vol a day its to short for me but overall I did enjoy it.

1595141979|4.0|Shadow Kiss takes place shortly after the death of Mason and Rose killing her first strigoi. Everything is starting to get back to \\"normal\\" at the Academy. Then Rose sees Mason's ghost. Rose keeps it to herself that she is seeing Mason but it soon starts to interfere: the Dhamphirs are in Guardian training and Rose freezes during an \\"attack\\" and everyone starts questioning her. Victor Dashkov is also going on trial and Adrian helps to get Rose, Lissa, & Christian there to give their witness statements. Then... Strigoi attacks the Academy and everyone is at risk.<br /><br />Oh gosh, I loved this one. Not as much as Frostbite but pretty darn close. Rose keeps getting better and better as a character. She is so strong-willed plus her sarcasm and bitchy demeanor are hilarious. Dimitri is so freakin hot and ... him and Rose get even closer <3 Lissa hardly annoyed me in this one, and Christian was awesome.  I wasn't really surprised when Rose was chosen to be his \\"test\\" guardian, but I'm glad it happened.  I never liked that they were supposed to be enemies so when they start getting along in this book it made my day! Adrian is his usual self in this book, and honestly I don't see the appeal in him the way everyone else does.  Maybe I'm biased because I'm so Team Dimitri but I just don't think he is all that special.<br /><br />I was really happy that this book takes you outside of the Academy again.  I love the setting of St. Vladimir's but it's nice to change it up a bit.  I loved having a bit of peek into the Palace, and Mia was back  The only downside I had to this book was... I cried at the end, and by cry I mean bawled. If you have read this one, you will know exactly what part I meant but my heart just seized up.<br /><br />The ending of Shadow Kiss was definitely a bigger cliffhanger than the rest of the series, and I actually did have to scurry out to pick up Blood Promise. Richelle Mead is absolutely doing this amazing series justice, book after book.  I can't wait to finish this series and see what direction she is going to take... especially after this ending!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Easy read, but still very detailed about the relationship between an experienced dominant and an inexperienced female. Wow, wow wow!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. I loved the story of Vegas craziness turned in to love. I also liked how they both had to get past their emotional baggage.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Why is it that reviewers feel this overwhelming urge to tell the whole story of the reviewed book, [[ASIN:0385535147 The Racketeer]] ?? Please don't do this. Let others enjoy the story as they see it and not from your perspective.<br /><br />I found the book to be fun, unputadownable (!!) for sure, and just Grisham, relaxed, having a good time and turning out something decent, entertaining and readable for a change. When you start reading it make sure you have plenty of time to finish it in one sitting!! It will wrap you around it's little finger right from the first page to the last.<br /><br />Dear John,<br />I hope so much to see more of you, writing like this!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|Well developed, relatable characters in this humorous novel that's sure to tickle you.  Good summer reading for those who don't want heavy fall themes as the days get shorter.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|My grandson wasn't really interested in this movie. I enjoyed it because I was young I watched the wizard of oz a zillion times and still enjoy it to this day and i'm 58
B005SGMNII|5.0|This show is awesome.  Decided to watch the pilot to see what the fuss was all about and I will say even the pilot is absolutely hilarious.  I am now on season 5
B009AMANBA|3.0|I waited with great anticipation the past year to see \\"Lincoln\\". As time grew near for the movie to be released I heard through the great vine that this move was going to be the best of the year.  Finally it arrives and a  friend and I rush to the the head of the line to purchase our tickets and sadly were told its sold out.  What a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT to us both, so patiently  we waited another week and at last, we have our tickets in our hands and feel as though we won the Willy Wonka's Golden ticket to the candy factory just to walk away after seeing Lincoln disappointed.  \\"Lincoln\\" should have been called just what is was, \\"The Passing of the 13th Amendment\\".  I had high hopes and was under the impression Lincoln was going to be more about the his life, but instead in was a segment of his life as President during the passing of the 13th Amendment.  I found it a bit boring at times, it tended to drag on and on, I was grateful that my popcorn was keeping me awake through this portion of the movie. The script was filled with very long winded sentences where one wanted to almost jump in and say  \\"Slow Down,\\"  \\"Inhale\\", \\"Take a Breath\\", the dialogue just bounced from one mouth to another mouth like a ping pong tournament. The dialogue was confusing, not people friendly.<br /><br /> Halfway into the movie things start to pick up and my attention was revived.  Although the beginning of this movie was not a eye opener, there are many greats about it.  Daniel Day Lewis, OUTSTANDING performance as LINCOLN, Absolutely OUTSTANDING!  Sally Field portrayed Mary Todd Lincoln, another OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE.  Her performance was touching, sincere, and realistic.  She showed the  personality of Mary Todd as all as she was; a mother, a grieving mother, a wife to the President, a \\"women\\" who  truly loved her husband AND even possibly, a hoot as some thought she was.  I found the scene where she was telling off Thadddeus Stevens ( played by  Tommy Lee Jones) outstanding.  She told him  what she disliked about him, how the people felt about him, compared what he was lacking compared to her husband, yet she was very lady- like  still  leaving Thaddeus with a  splinter in his buns. James Spader's performance was a bit annoying, attempting to come across as being humorous, I found him to be a flop. Thumbs up for the customs, 5 star all around, except for the hideous  wig that  Tommy Lee Jones wore, why they couldn't do a better  on that is beyond me., it was actually humorous it was so bad.  I found the subtitles through out the movie  to be a plus, they confirmed the \\"who\\", \\"where's\\" and exactly \\"when's\\". If you wanted to see how the passing of the 13th Amendment came about, this was truly then a 5 star movie, but for me who was wanting to see more of Lincoln's life be told, I have to admit, I was a bit let down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Easy read, but still very detailed about the relationship between an experienced dominant and an inexperienced female. Wow, wow wow!
B00000JPH6|3.0|This movie my kids watched when they where younger and enjoyed it my grandson on the other hand did not like it at all scared him
B007SGM084|3.0|The first book is okay. The next two are pretty much the same sex scenes over and over. Not much originality. I almost quit reading halfway through the 2nd but ending up finishing the series. If you want a good Romance series I would recommend Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. Much more interesting and the plot is so much better!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|its fantastic, period. worth every penny. my boyfriend introduced me to deamau5. not dubstep, a whole new level to electronic music
B002ZG99TK|5.0|A fun, action-packed movie that happens in near real time.  Probably shouldn't watch it while riding the train, but it's otherwise a great time.  Hang onto your seat!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great set, great picture, great show, sad that there is only 1 season...<br /><br />Very cool commentaries and special features are included in this set.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing the Lumineers perform for a private party of about 20 people. I was instantly hooked and bought not 1 but 2 versions of the album (digital and hard copy of the CD). I listen to the entire album at least once a week!
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I saw this on tv and had to buy it..Very interesting ;<br />I recomend this to everyone....great actors and actress.............
B00069YE0W|5.0|This is a really relaxing, beautiful album.  I didn't like it when I first heard it, but the uniquely folksy sound, the poignant lead guitars, and the dark, depressing lyrics somehow fuse together to produce a strangely honest album, both emotional and uplifting in its way.  There's not much here in terms of lyrical content that could remotely be considered uplifting.  It's as if the original melodies, and the unrestrained passion of John's playing somehow transforms lines like &#34;There is no more hope, there are no dreams&#34; and &#34;I'm a working man; I don't understand why clock-out comes so slow, every time&#34; into something that's gorgeous and uplifting.  It's magical, alchemical, haunting, original, and unique.  This album is even less like the Red Hot Chili Peppers than most of his other solo work.  The only thing it shares with the Chili Peppers that the soulful, intense, trademark sound of his vintage lead guitars.<br /><br />So, with more than ten solo albums, John has only ever released one music video from his solo work, and it's for the first track on this album, &#34;The Past Recedes.&#34;  I recommend you check it out on YouTube before buying this -- and if you don't like it after three listens, then stay away from Curtains.  Instead, I'd recommend the polished mainstream-rock album Shadows Collide With People.  But if you're feeling courageous, and if you think you have the stomach for dark, depressing lyrics paired with folksy upright bass, then this might just be one of the best albums you'll ever listen to.
B009157BWU|5.0|A beautiful story and footage. My 8 year old and I loved it! Its rare to find something to watch that isn't infiltrated with filth....even children's films are sometimes questionable.  This move was a gem.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really liked this book. It kept me guessing and was very fast paced. I would definitely recommend this book.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Enjoyed the insights into the power of Washington lobbyists and tort suits. Grisham writes so that anyone can understand even the most complicated topics.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I'm glad this super - hero movie turned out so well. I first seen this in the theater and was pleased then and am very pleased now. A lot of good action, good story line, and in this case I'm glad they left room for The Avengers II. If You've never seen Hulk, Thor, or any Iron man movies I don't think you'll be disappointed. If anything this movie makes you want to see them. Great entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was great. It was hard to put this book down. Very exciting reading wish there was a 4th book
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Lots of family laughs!  Very cute and funny.  We borrowed this movie a few times from others and FINALLY purchased our own copy.
0547884591|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Tim's. I have read his previous 2 books and were blown away by them. This book Tim has really put a lot into it and you can tell. I purchased a physical copy and was not disappointed. It is very well done and put together, beautiful pictures and how-to's throughout the book. It would be a Tim Ferris book without some extras though! There are lots of interesting side tracks to further illustrate the skill of meta learning (what the book is really about, it only uses cooking as a vessel). I am by no means a professional chef, but I did work in a kitchen for 7 years and the book is very well done and easy to follow. It is the crown jewel of the 4 hour series and I was very pleased with it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to get their feet wet with cooking or language learning or who wants to learn how to learn a blueprint to pick up skills easily!
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|This is a fabulous DVD. I went to a baby shower and the host was playing this DVD. I love the variety of artists Tony Bennett perfomed with. Great for dinner parties. This would be a very nice gift. It's a must have.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This was like watching a movie from the days before younger directors ransacked Hollywood with skills suitable for producing duplicate blockbusting cookie cutters with comic book characters, competitively magnified mayhem and predictable CGI gimmicks. I swear, I was watching this movie thinking it had to be made by a seasoned old timer with decades of experience in directing. But I figured anyone with that kind of skill was already dead and buried.  After the closing credits, I searched for Brad Furman to find out who he was and thankfully he's young enough to make many more movies and treat us to a long, distinguished career in film.<br /><br />This movie was totally entertaining and suspenseful without falsely manipulating the audience with shiny monsters or close-up car crash andrenaline. Instead, the plot's twists unfolded naturally. You knew they were coming but he kept us in the present moment until they popped us in the jaw. On the set, but behind the scenes, the present and past eloped and their oddly quiet offspring became this film's best friend.  A fusion of rap and rhythm and blues were caught on yellowed Kodachrome without predictable nostalgia or sentimentality. The supporting cast of camera work, editing, acting and post production meshed seamlessly in unified support of the story. Matthew McCanaughey about-faced from his sometimes loveable dufus into a man again.  Increasingly beautiful Marissa Tomei softly sparkled as if native to her almost ordinary but notably fresh character dimensions.<br /><br />For the time being, Brad Furman plans to stick with stories from his life in Philly, but I see him branching out into new territory he doesn't even think he's ready for, making himself into one of Hollywood's top director/producers. He's gritty now, but he'll move into a style he doesn't foresee, at least publicly.  He'll be crafting covertly hypnotic visual and psychological dreamscapes you won't notice you entered until the lights come up and you're unable to stand. He'll write, direct and/or produce movies that, despite their big budgets, will blow us away using only a table fan and an open window.<br /><br />Brad Furman dons the finesse of a high-class hit man, instinctively savvy enough to never walk it on the street. But as he passes in the lobby we can't mistake a hint of ozone in the draft of expensive cologne following his deceptively casual stroll through the sliding glass panels that open to the kleig lit, sapphire carpet running its full length to the entryway of the Awards in progress.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I would recommend this game.  I enjoy playing and it makes time fly.  You are limited to what you can do if you don't want to spend real money.  I don't buy any extras. and it is still ok.
B008458O3S|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game a lot. If you like puzzle solving games, you should check this game out.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|Great supernatural movie. The girl actress is a bit annoying in some parts but Nicolas Cage plays a good role.
B000TENNME|5.0|This is a must for any half-way collector of anything Pet Shop Boys related.<br />Two Divided by Zero, Love Comes Quickly.......terrific.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This series is so good. You will want to keep watching to see what happens next. The price was cheap for a new blue ray dvd. I will be ordering season two and three of Spartacus.
0446580848|2.0|I have been a long-time DeMille fan. Whereas previous books were full of action and suspense, this book was boring until the last quarter. By the time I reached the good stuff, I couldn't wait to be finished with the book and read something more interesting and exciting. I have been a big fan of his John Corey character; too bad he doesn't give him something to do more than make wisecracks about Yemen. Hopefully DeMille will return to form with his next effort.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a good show, but then again all good descent shows don't really last that long. I have watched the season and love rerun DVD watching.
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|Born to Die and Video Games are the pinnacles of this LP.  Great listening, but becomes a bit monotonous towards the end.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book even though I am not a teenager.  It was a fun, light read that takes you into the life of unpopular teenagers.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is a gifted story teller.  His super spy Mitch Rapp is sent to investigate the kidnapping of CIA operative Joe Rickman.  He finds that things aren't always what they seem when you are dealing with Middle Eastern countries like Pakistan.  The novel is fast paced and intricate without being confusing.
0143119680|5.0|Good read and very informative of the history of witches. I enjoyed the book and will be ordering the part 2
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching The Hunger Games movie I was eager to read the Hunger Game books. As with most books, it was able to explain things in more detail than the movie and it gave me a better understanding of the characters and plot. It was very well written and paced. I love it when I find a book that keeps me engaged. After reading the first book, I also purchased the other two books in the trilogy. I highly recommend these books to anyone who likes a good story, but also enjoys thinking about the what-if's of human nature and society as a whole.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  As a medical professional, it was interesting to follow the doctor's journey as he tried to rationalize what happened to him from a scientific point of view. I found it very disturbing because it did not really validate what I believe spirtually.  That being said, this book is an excellent read for everyone to &#34;start the conversation&#34;.
B008IJT0CE|1.0|I bought this app hoping the skipping problem had been fixed.  It has not been fixed and the skips make the application useless.<br /><br />Live and learn.  I'll pay more attention to the reviews.  BTW I loaded ot on a Fire HD 7.
B00979CS50|1.0|I really, REALLY wanted to like this album (especially since I plunked down 14 bucks for it), but it's DRIVEL!  That's the only way I can describe it!  \\"Driftin' Back\\" is torturous.  They must have \\"looped\\" the drums, rhythm guitar, and bass.  Nobody could play that dirge for such a seemingly endless time. \\"Psychedelic Pill\\" is processing just for the sake of processing.  (\\"Hey, what does this dial do?\\"  Okay, I'm working with an old Gates audio board.)  There are no cleverly placed nuances.  The effects are as subtle as a hammer.  \\"Ramada Inn\\" is like the first cut---same thing only different---but I do like the harmonies.  \\"Born In Ontario\\" is an insult to my heritage. If Neil is mocking Springsteen, the joke's on Young.<br /><br />The whole project seems to be a joke on his fans.  I can hear him thinking, \\"If I attach my name to a rotting carp, will they buy that too?\\"  Maybe?  I bought his book too!<br /><br />And shame on those reviewers who gave this waste of plastic 5 stars!  One noted that Neil has had several \\"crazy whims\\" over the years.  I just wish I hadn't wasted 14 dollars on his latest!
1451695195|5.0|After seeing Dr. Alexander interviewed on TV, we couldn't wait to read his book.  The book was a great read.  It was great to see his view from such a scientific viewpoint! :)
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I have played for hours and is one of my most favorite apps. I think it was more fun than angry birds. This app is a must have..
B009S8PEHY|1.0|I love the album andI really like Rod Stewart.  However I can't figure out how to download it to ITunes.  Therefore I can't put it on a CD to listen to in other rooms of my house.  No one comes into my office to visit.  So, it was a waste for me.  i have an Apple desktop.  Does anyone know how to get the album into iTunes?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a very good game I liked it I just cant beat one level it was a interesting game
B001CEE1YE|5.0|For a long time I have been thinking to get this collection of 3 movies as these are one of my most fav. of all time. Esp. the first two parts. And really glad that I am getting these in Blu-Ray. As a collectibles they are the one of the best one's to have.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|Sabriel remains my favorite novel in the Abhorsen Trilogy, one of my absolute favorite literary series ever, even now, a decade after first reading it. This introduction to the Old Kingdom is everything one could ask of a fantasy world-building novel, from multiple maps, a detailed setting (including my favorite, the Abhorsen house) painted through the characters' interactions with it and each other, the unique magic system of the Abhorsen's necromancy bells, the magic- science/technology dichotomy of the Southern Nations and the Old Kingdom, royal family politics, and ultimately the unfolding characterization and backstory of the characters, setting the story into motion. The expansive mythology of this story and universe goes way beyond the 2 decades or so that the trilogy takes place over, and learning more about it a decade-long dream.<br />Sabriel and the Abhorsen Trilogy are at the top of my recommendation list to anyone who appreciates quality fantasy world-building, and I also highly recommend Nix's short story anthology \\"Across the Wall\\" (particularly the novelette, \\"Nicholas Sayre and the Creature in the Case\\" in relation to the Abhorsen trilogy).<br />This version of Sabriel is the one I bought as a middle schooler and was devastated over when an unfortunate roof leak caused water damage, but have since replaced for both my mother and brother, also avid readers, to enjoy the Old Kingdom as much as I do.<br />Lastly, Mogget and the Disreputable Dog are among my favorite characters ever, thank you Garth Nix for creating them and the world of Sabriel
B0094M2GNE|4.0|Really fun monster movie that doesnt take itself too seriously.  Not the kind of movie you watch over and over again.  Still one of the best options when its one of those times you can't find anything good to watch.  Not really great but really good. Great way to convert your children to juvenile delinquents.  Gave it an extra star for its effect on the decline of western civilzation.  Special effects are cheesy but the script and actors are awesome.  Why I won't be caught dead in the bad parts of london anytime soon.  A little bit too long. Needs some cheezy rap music here and there.  Sometimes the english accents are a little tough to follow.  Still better than 99% of the crap from mainstream hollywood.
B004SBX112|5.0|I am older and never had opportunity to play video games so I thought this might be a fun purchase and I am having a blast playing it. Thanks Angry Bird.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Good quality item.  Offers protection for the Kindle Fire.  One small dislike is that the case has to be removed for some of the games my daughter likes to play.  But that is not a big deal to either one of us.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|I did not find the information in the book informative nor did it have anything to do with sharing a proven marketing system to successfully sell Amazon ebooks.  The examples the author provides are not credible or support the claims that the author sold 1 million ebooks simply by his secret marketing technique which is... dumdedum dum daaaaaahhhhhh.  The secret to successful marketing of your ebook is, wait, hold on to your seats everyone-spoiler alert.  The secret is to write an incredibly long  blog story about an incident of a famous person and somehow tie that into your own book's story and be a social network butterfly about it.  Having been actively involved on facebook, youtube, blogging, and recently on twitter for the past four years, I know for a fact that his claims of being an active blogger and social networker boosted his ebook sales is exaggerated to say the least.  After doing some research online about the author, I found news articles that reveal that author had purchased hundreds of fake Amazon reviews for his ebooks.  Perhaps, he should have wrote a chapter in his book saying that the magic ingredient that boosted the author's Amazon ebook sales is being an utter fraud.<br /><br />My rating is 1/5.  Check out Joanna Penn of Creative Penn of Lauren Clark of 30 Day Books if you want real honest advice and real examples on how to market your book.
B0096PAA6E|2.0|To labeled someone as a new Hendrix with these songs is a joke. Come on people, this album is not even good. Just a few good songs and the rest of the songs does not even belong to this album. I bought this CD and return it next day.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|In a very sensitive and funny way, this is an alert for us to think about how the actions we take today can impact the future.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty is really a smart, sexy and insecure guy.  Hopefully by the time I finish &#34;Book Two&#34;, he'll have broken out of that shell or wall he has up for Ana.  So far, so good.....
0345803507|5.0|Great story--not just the sex.  Read all three books in a few days.  Couldn't put it down.  Obviously for mature adults.
B008OOYALE|4.0|the game is catchy but you need more ways to earn food and gold. need to be able to gift other than gold. what about coin for food?
6304711905|5.0|this is a great dvd to add to your collection if you enjoy westerns. really good movie i recommend highly
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This was fun, but not spectacular, as the story followed a predictable plot line, and everything moved quickly along to get to the end.
0545265355|5.0|These books were emotionally powerful page-turners. The main character is very real and human, you can see her strengths and her weaknesses throughout the series, and feel as though you are taking part in a real life journey. That being said, Peeta and Gale were more thinly imagined, lacking some depth. In a way though, with Peeta, it also enhances the story, because of the hope, the spark of life and the possibility of happiness that Peeta brings to Katniss. I really struggled with the ending of Mockingjay at first. The story as a whole is very haunting and leaves you feeling hollow and wanting something more, but ultimately I understand what the point was, and it suited. I just wish there was a little more in there to make you feel a little less like you'd lost something profound. The points author is trying to make resonate throughout the writing, and even if you aren't reading it to take in a deeper meaning it's still very entertaining. Yes, they have flaws, all writing does, but these books could speak to any person, young or old. You will definitely walk away with something.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book would have been okay if I hadn't just read Fifty Shades.  Like another reviewer said it was just like Fifty Shades with different character names.  The characters were the same, the plot was the same.  Just didn't do it for me.  Won't be reading any other books in this series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hooked on this series. Read before going to see the movie - the movie leaves a lot out. Really great series!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great acting, thought-provoking stories, interesting and wonderful setting, touching and enjoyable! This is a lovely movie all the way around. Love it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This review is written by my 10 year old son Alex.  I like it but in comparison to the Pc version it's not that good. I would suggest the Pc version it's awesome.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-  The pocket edition costs less<br />-  Compared to the free pc version you can use \\"Creative mode\\"<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-  In the PC version you can fight more enimies<br />-  In the PC version you can craft<br />-  The touch screen is more difficult than using a mouse
B008ELUEQC|5.0|My wife wanted this for Christmas but I gave it to her early so she could enjoy it during this holiday season.  She loves it.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school and I am so glad I read it again as an adult. Highly recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are not necessarily a complex read...but I have enjoyed them very much.<br />I got all 3 on my Kindle and was through them in 2 weeks.
0785163174|1.0|Avengers vs. X-Men Story?<br /><br />Won't go into the deets: good, could have been better.<br /><br />Edition?<br /><br />It's oversized, which is nice. HOWEVER. I cannot, will not, and absolutely REFUSE to give a $75 graphic novel anything above one star if it does not come with a sewn binding. 5-issue story arc hardcovers are forgiven for having glued binding. 20+ issue hardcovers are not.<br /><br />What is wrong with glued binding? For omnibus-newbies: SEWN BINDINGS lay flat when you open them. You can clearly read the entire page, including medial areas of the page near the \\"gutter\\" in the middle. GLUED BINDINGS are a much \\"tighter\\" book and do not lay flat when opened. If you try to open a glued omnibus and lay it flat, it will spring back and shut itself (unless you try to forcibly bend the hell out of the book binding to keep it in a more \\"open\\" state, which is likely to tear up the binding and cause pages to fall out). GLUED BINDINGS also have what is called \\"gutter loss,\\" which means that if there are word balloons or art in the page areas near the bindings, you will have difficulty reading those areas because they are so close to the gluing.<br /><br />This decision is inexcusable and lackluster on Marvel's part, which is strange considering that Marvel is usually the front-runner in terms of graphic novel quality over DC comics (whose omnibuses have historically been glued).<br /><br />I'm now worried as to the future quality of Marvel's oversized hardcovers.
0756655730|5.0|Again, DK makes great comprehensive books on subjects. My son can't get enough of them. Good enough for a young child into fossils and dinos and great for adults too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hooked on this series. Read before going to see the movie - the movie leaves a lot out. Really great series!
B006VJMZXY|5.0|I found the book very engaging especially having travelled to warickshire and london. It was interesting and unputdownable! The author has done it again
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|The choice of songs is outstanding.  The orchestra's presentation behind Susan Boyle's beautiful interpretation of the songs<br />greatly enhances this marvelous collection of show tunes.  I enjoyed it even more than I thought I would.
0375851569|5.0|Loved by kids! Board books they will never want to give up, even when they have outgrown them. Fond memories!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Got this book because there was so much hype about it. The writing is unimpressive. The main character in the beginning says things like golly jeepers and two chapters later she's cursing like a sailor. If you're buying it only for the BDSM then go right ahead and purchase
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I felt for both characters in this story. I loved the little plots Megan schemes to try to test Conner. It was very romantic yet funny to. This is a very enjoyable book to just laze around in your pj's and read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I got away from Stephen King for awhile because he was getting a little too weird for me but this is not his typical novel. A refreshing change!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Imagine a girl locked in a tower for twelve years who suddenly escapes into a haunted forest or some shit. Then, within the course of what seems like a few hours, the girl is hunted down by - you guessed it - a drunk, brawling, good-for-nothing hunter who is the only one brave enough to enter the haunted forest, capture the girl, and return said girl to a wicked queen who sucks souls from young maidens in order to stay young and beautiful.<br />Somehow the young girl convinces the drunk hunter to help her and they take off through the woods (this part is really fuzzy because I had to smoke a bowl in order to continue watching). There are some midgets dressed like the seven dwarves from the Disney version except they're all tough and grumpy and want to kill the drunk hunter (big surprise at this point).<br />In another amazing turn of events the young girl (the same one who spent twelve of her most formative years in isolation in a tower, mind you) eventually leads an army of people and midgets and shit against the evil queen. The girl even managed to find incredibly fitted armor (complete with those little boob cup things so you know she's a chick), learn how to ride a horse, and use a sword in an incredibly short period of time after having lived the last twelve years in isolation in a tower. This is a truly gifted girl.<br />As far as the acting goes, at least it was slightly better than the plot. Imagine a drunk Thor, a bored and aging super model/actress, and an actress who is as bad as the writing of almost all the movies she's been in. There are some cool fight scenes - sans acting, and the musical score isn't bad after a couple bowls.<br />Overall I think watching this movie caused the death of more brain cells than anything illicit I consumed during the 128 minutes of sensory water boarding called a movie. Save your money, your time, and your soul by watching the trailer and then banging your head against a brick wall while reciting &#34;The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner&#34; from memory over and over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hooked on this series. Read before going to see the movie - the movie leaves a lot out. Really great series!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Great movie to watch with the kids. Loved the animation and the story line.  A little slow in some parts,but all around good movie.
006107327X|5.0|Good prize for the book. And if U want to build up a portfolio u have to buy it. Awesome!!!!!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This works well for the games I have played with it.  I just need to clean my desk off to make some more room.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who has not seen this movie or anyone looking to add it to their own collection
B0027MJU00|4.0|I picked up this book because I loved Sharp Objects so much. This book was good but it draged on a bit toward the end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is fantastic. The writing, the acting and the cinematography are all epic. Nearly every episode has me at the edge of my seat.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Rap these days is terrible. There's no creativity behind them or meaning besides getting into girls' pants, making money, and partying. Macklemore raps about truth, overcoming society's obstacles, political stances, saving money, and not letting anyone oppress you. I heard one song of his and loved him. Listened to three songs, fell in love. Listened to the album, had to buy it. Not much gets better than what he gives you.
6305428042|5.0|Love this movie! So excited to find it at this price. Came in great condition very quickly. I highly recommend this dvd
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book in High School and years later it is still just as amazing!! Its a wonderful read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Really like the weather channel. Like the idea of putting in different cities and able to go back to them without having to relist them.
0547884591|5.0|This is so much more than a cookbook. It is a complete deconstruction of how we learn and uses cooking as a vehicle to exercise the methods Tim is teaching.  Tim uses each lesson to ease the reader into new skills.<br /><br />The first part of this book fascinated me.  Tim breaks down his method for learning in a simple and graspable way.  He uses great examples from breaking down how he learns languages, to memorization techniques, to how he was able to deconstruct tango and go on to win a Guinness world record.  As he takes you through his methods, he gives hands on ways to experiment with each step.  I particularly have been having a blast with the deck of cards memorization techniques.<br /><br />And then we get into the cooking part and it is so much easier to grasp than any other book on cooking I've worked with.  Tim writes in an accessible, funny and entertaining way.  I've already started going forward with the cooking lessons and the \\"osso buko\\" I made turned out great!<br /><br />Tim's style isn't for everyone.  He doesn't write books that you read.  He writes books that you have to interact with to really get the good stuff out of it.  If you're just looking to read a book about cooking then this isn't the right book for you.  If you want to really get into deconstructing how you learn in order to pick up some new skills and you're ready to participate by interacting with the content then this book will definitely give you a good time.<br /><br />I bought the kindle version first to give it a whirl.  The content is so dense and rich that I am now purchasing the hardcover.  I believe I will be able to get much more out of the material with an actual tangible copy of the book.  Now that I'm getting into the hands on cooking lessons, it will be helpful to have a book with pages i can easily flip to.  Plus there is a ton of extra material to check out in the appendix and the kindle version doesn't make it easy to flip to and from the appendix to where you left off reading.  The four stars is for the kindle version. This really should be bought in hardcover.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is by far Tim's greatest publishing accomplishment.  So if you're into learning how you can improve your learning capabilities and picking up some awesome new skills in the process then this is for you.  But fair warning, if you just want to read and don't actually intend to interact with the material then you probably won't get too much out of it.  But that's reader error, and no fault to the author.<br /><br />Update:  I received the hardcover edition and it is beautiful.  Get the hardcover.  Review updated to 5 stars for the tangible book.

1451613512|4.0|So after reading, question is, where do we go from here, now knowing what we do.<br />With other works revolving around the same question, where are we Americans heading?<br />How many politicians, who should be open eyed, are closed mouthed on America's direction.<br />Who makes these decisions re foreign policy, ....there needs to be checks balances.<br />Public debate, other opinions entertained. It's no surprise the aliens  don't want to share their technology with our primitive human kind.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love this game great for the tablet and easy to learn how to play. I give it 5 star ratings
1451696191|4.0|I kept hearing reviews for this book for years, and they were pretty all over the place. I finally sat down to read it for myself as a junior in college. My biggest regret was that I did not read it sooner, as it is a gripping and very wholesome \\"coming of age\\" story. In fact, it is one of the best I have read in this niche so far.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the characters are unrealistic - mainly Charlie. My experience in high school was that people didn't burst into tears in front of each other once a week, and Charlie seems to be pretty sexually conservative for a 15 year old (even in his own thought life) with no real motivation as to why. I'm not trying to spoil anything here with my review, but it's also kind of unrealistic how the protagonist writes so much about smoking cigarettes but maybe a paragraph or two about chronically smoking marijuana. Little unrealistic things like this litter the pages of the book and keep it, in my mind, away from a five star book. However, I feel the need to reiterate that it was the best coming of age story I've read since Catcher in the Rye. My experience in high school was in many ways able to be related to Charlie's story, and I definitely felt a heavy pinch of nostalgia in my mind after devouring the book.<br /><br />I think a lot of the people giving this book bad ratings are just people who want to dislike something because it's popular or because it's an MTV book. If you give it a chance, I think you may find that it has quite a bit of value. It only takes about three hours to read and it's very easy to get through.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this one because it is very challenging.  I like card games a lot.  This one keeps my attention.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|There are books that are better written that tell the same story with out having the redundancy, the same phrases over and over again.  Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty series wold be a good example of better writing, check out Anais Nin, for wonderful erotica.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Everyone knows (and should know) John Williams. Because of his partnerships with George Lucas, Chris Columbus, and the great Steven Spielberg, we are used to hearing extravagant orchestral scores that can't possibly be imagined without the silver screen behind them. However, on Spielberg's new film Lincoln, both the director (Spielberg) and the composer (Mr. Williams) take a new approach.<br /><br />Lincoln's score is subtle, \\"felt, not heard\\" in a sense. Williams demonstrates supreme taste and maturity by tactfully introducing the music at key moments in the film, and adding to its subtle grandeur. Just like in his other scores, the musical themes are synonymous with particular characters or emotions. With that said, the music is absolutely beautiful. You will hear a blend of sweeping Americana in the style of Copland, but also a delicate folk side. It is important to note that Mr. Williams hired music historians that specialized in the Civil War era to help him accomplish an accurate and idiomatic sound.<br /><br />Another highlight is the fact that the Chicago Symphony Orchestra recorded the music. The orchestra lives and breathes like one big soloist. The blend and phrasing is phenomenal. You'll never hear a better brass section than CSO's. Williams uses all the cohorts of the ensemble: militaristic percussion, warm brass choirs, and the light sounds of the woodwind choir. The strings aren't ignored either, and they provide the main emotional framework of the score. The reason Williams hired CSO is because Lincoln was actually from Illinois, and he wanted to pay tribute to this great American figure by using the closest major orchestra.<br /><br />Lincoln's soundtrack is not nearly as extravagant as E.T., Star Wars, Indiana Jones, or Harry Potter, but it contains a beauty that is so subtle that it is to be commended. The more I listen to the soundtrack, the more I appreciate what Mr. Williams has done. 5 stars, hands down.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|it says I can't get it wirelessly, but I am plugged in and still doesn't recognize me to be able to download it.  I will likely have to get it in Adobe format and read it that way.  Loan expires shortly.  Others seem to work ok.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|I am 47 with a 13 & 11 year old son. They listen to all kinds of bad music that is pushed out and sounds virtually the same.  I bought this for there MP3 players (iPods) and the next day they were literally humming and singing Limelight. Yes, I am trying to influence there musical taste. These kids should be able to enjoy a range of music and not the crap just pushed out on the local pop station. They love it as much as I do now.
B0056WODZ0|4.0|Enjoyed my first Thea Harrison read and it has definitely captured my imagination.<br />Yes I will be following the series. A great fast reading action packed story. Lots of fantasy<br />lots of romance too ... If you enjoyed the Merry Gentry series by LK Hamilton try this- a bit lighter<br />in style but worth reading.
B008SVS0K0|4.0|Quick and up tempo as usual with a couple of songs in regards to modern government and society.  A reliable buy.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|What a wonderful book. I wish I would have found this when I was a child rather than a freshman in college. I was browsing the book store during a long break between classes on campus one day and found this gem! I can't even count how many times I've read this! I'm a lover of Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, everything Neil Gaiman(who adores this author by the way). This is just one of those comfort books for me, makes you feel good!

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have always had a vision of heaven as a place where we are finally freed from the limitations and trappings of our human nature.  A place where we are liberated from worry, judgement, anger, jealousy, greed and loneliness.  This book renewed my faith and brings me great joy in knowing this is where my loved ones & I will meet again.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I thought the movie had a great storyline. The animation is also very impressive. I liked the humor they included in the story which kept the theme light hearted.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I regret buying this book. I found the plot to be very slow and in fact did not bother to finish the book. The characters are stilted and unlikable.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It has a lot of powerful functions, very good design. It runs very fast on my kindle fire hd.AND MOST IMPORTANT, IT IS FREE!
B000IDGDPA|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie on the airplane with our iPad.  Wonderful drama taking place in the 30's portraying the social pretense and expectations of men and women, especially the wealthy during this period.  We enjoyed the story's twists and turns which offered subtle hints in fulfilling the plot. The characters and acting was great.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Having read all of Grisham's book, this was predictable, but I still enjoyed it.  Couldn't put it down.  Would highly recommend.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I would like to preface this review by saying I am writing this review based solely on the contents and merits of the film and not any of additional content/features (directors comments, etc.)<br /><br />After watching this film in the theater and again on Blu-ray, I am left with the distinct impression that this film, despite being enjoyable to watch, just lacks a true identity. For all that this film does well, it is \\"Alien\\" like but doesn't fully commit to the terror and fear of its predecessor to be considered a true prelude. More importantly, in Alien, the only question being asked was \\"How do we kill these things in order to survive?\\" and not a series of origin questions--\\"Who made us? Where did we come from?\\"<br /><br />Because the film only half-heartily commits to being association with Ridley Scott's infamous work, it falls prey to a series of too predictable set-pieces that only tease the viewer with what could have been. Honestly, without sharing this symbolism with Aliens, this movie by itself would be quite unremarkable. Outside of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender's characters, everyone else, including Charlize Theron (who is a very skilled and gifted actress) in the film could easily be substituted with anyone else and they would adequately fill the role.<br /><br />Ultimately, because of the scope of the questions being answered, this movie leaves one with more questions than answers. I would be hard-pressed to convince anyone to purchase it (unless its on sale somewhere during the holiday season). It's worth watching, but I fail to believe that this is a film that one could watch over-and-over again. Rent it, catch it on cable, borrow it from a friend, but otherwise, save you money.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I guess I shouldn't have expected all that much from such an affordable amp, but I noticed little discernible enhancement to sound quality when using this product.<br /><br />The music had the potential to be louder, but it wasn't really richer.<br /><br />You get what you pay for, I guess.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's very compact and easy to charge and carry around.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|It is not a plug and play thing. You really have to use it a few times to understand how to use it. I thinkk you would be better off getting something of higher quality and functionality.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series of Firefly. Wish more had been made. I particularly enjoyed that all the episodes were in Fullscreen (which I much prefer) and subtitled which I need.
B003Y5H574|4.0|\\"And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality\\" (Costanza) - Ryan Gosling is painfully handsome.<br /><br />Emma Stone on the other hand is 'kinda cute' at best and even her personality in this movie is just 'average' for a typical scattered, clueless, annoying girl with some previous boyfriend PTSD.  She almost derailed this otherwise very funny and smart (for a romantic comedy) movie for me.<br /><br />Ok now despite my previous point I really enjoyed this movie when I had expected to hate it.  The cast, Emma Stone aside, was excellent, the soundtrack was cool, and the movie was funny and entertaining.  I would definitely recommend it to other dudes looking to score a point with their lady.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Zooey has an amazing, calming voice.  I put this on my iPod, forgetting I had the repeat function turned on.  I listened to this album for, no kidding, about 6 hours, because it was enjoyable enough to leave on as background music while I worked on the computer with the cat on my lap.  I kept thinking I'd get up and turn it off &#34;after this song&#34;.  But I kept liking the next song, and the next song, etc.  It was very cozy and heartwarming.  My boyfriend doesn't care for this style of holiday music (I think he prefers the more traditional versions from when he was kid) and he said he thoroughly enjoyed this album.  There's not a single song on the record that we don't like!
B00425S1H8|4.0|The cable is working well and was 1/3 the price of what you'd pay at Radio Shack or Best Buy - more than offsets the shipping. My main complaint is that the length of the cable. These things are only about 18&#34; long which is rather inconvenient for what I needed. My fault for not looking more carefully, but the length of all the ones I saw was generally buried in the specs instead of right up front where it should be, some are 5 feet long.

B0097AQEOK|2.0|While I agree with some of the other reviewers that these versions sound just fine, the problem I have is with the packaging. These are absolutely NOT original LP replicas. Unlike the Beatles and Dylan Mono boxes, which are exact LP replicas, these all come in the same cheap, flimsy paper covers. They are small and uniform, with the same thin gatefold cover on all.  They are nothing like the original covers. Still, if you don't care about that stuff, and you can get it cheap enough, it's not a bad deal.

B008AUGEFC|4.0|Fabulous writing... Perhaps a bit Herman Hesse's Magic Theatre in Steppenwolf - as visited by Henry James and P.K. Dick.  Be warned: the end of chapter one is NOT missing a page - please do not return the book; this is part of the strange journey the reader is forced to take along with the narrators.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had heard so much talk about how great this book was as a &#34;romance&#34; novel for the over 40 crowd and as I had always enjoyed a good romance story in my youth I decided to give it a try.  I was VERY disappointed!  This is nothing more than a kinky sex tale with an immature storyline, perfect for  porno magazine stock but seriously lacking romance.  I won't be finishing the trilogy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is fantastic for any history or time travel junkie.  This was my first Stephen King book.  I had no idea what to expect but it certainly was not this intensely based history type book.  A furious page turner.  It kept me up all night.  Now I &#34;get it&#34; - Stephen King is a master.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I'm so glad to get this in a set in its entirety! I bought it last Christmas, when it was on crazy sale, and I've watched so many of them. A great way to get all these wonderful movies in one collection!
B008G59IKO|5.0|It was a great follow up album to Uno! I can't wait for Tre! Green Day is my favorite band.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I found this novel to be very thought provoking and it had me examining my own values as a citizen and parent.  I couldn't put it down!  My husband read it right after I finished and he was equally intrigued.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a great airplane book, lazy afternoon &#34;girlie&#34; read.  I loved it!  Very interesting backdrop to the novel about the Victorian association of meaning to various flowers lifts this book out of the mere &#34;fluff&#34; romance novel type book.
0062073508|4.0|Very well developed characters, interesting book.  Although I knew who the killer was before the end, I loved Agatha Christie's books !!
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Typical of the franchise, but the gags are old and the jokes we have heard already many times.<br /><br />Also, what happened to TL Jones? Did he fight with the makeup crew?
B009AZZEU2|2.0|I not sure what folks are listening to, but this album just not do it for me.  I actually recently went thru all of Soundgarden's albums and put together a best of compilation for my iTunes a few months ago.  Then buying the new King Animal cd, what a dissappointment, something is seriously missing here, not exactly what. Production is good, maybe it's a lack of good vocal or song melodies?  Some nice guitar parts.  Lyrics are somewhat weak, but not as religion oriented as Cornell's solo work.  I think just the overall problem is the blandness of the songs.  There is not even one song from this album, that i thought could stand up to any of the songs on the prior three albums.  But hey, if they are back together, maybe the next album will improve significantly.
B004H0M8EA|3.0|Interesting but a tad pedantic.  Still reading it.  Interesting topic but a lot of statistics and material to wade through.
142314189X|3.0|This set was listed as having library binding.  It came as a boxed set in trade hardcover binding.  NOT what I was looking for for the over $50 price tag!  I could have purchased hardcover copies in great condition used for less money!  Disappointing.
B005LAII62|2.0|I expected more from the animators who did the Coraline adaptation, but then the story/script this time was not taken from a fine, dark Neil Gaiman story.<br /><br />Brilliant technical achievement in the animation, but everything else is recycled clichés: The Sixth Sense, Frankenstein, Night of the Living Dead/generic zombie flicks, car chases, grade-school bromance, even a dash of Beetlejuice.<br /><br />The action is s-l-o-w, the story meandering and full of dated pop-culture references, characters somewhat grotesque (not just the zombies) and confined to narrow stereotypes, and the PC/GA burden heavy-handed and tedious.<br /><br />Unlike the Coraline movie, I would not view ParaNorman again nor recommend it to others.
B0094FQZTM|5.0|Great sounding album, vocals, melodies, and guitars all very good on this album.  I did edit out some of the more religious lyrics, but other than that 5 stars.  Johan's voice sounds great and his lyrics are good as well.  There is even a cool cover tune called Paradise sung by band member Anders Iwers.  Bottom line is when i can pull 12 very good songs of a band release, that's pretty damn good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you gotta buy this people and I mean it!Because this game is totley fun and I know you like it because this game is fun and I toltely like it.so buy it people and I mean buy it!
B003THHIEM|5.0|It is interesting to see how the characters have changed over the seasons. Wish there were ass many episodes in season 1 as thr other seasons but it was also half the price.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I recommend everyone read Vince Flynn but especially people (from all political parties) who think they know what is going to happen in Afghanistan & Pakistan. Albeit fiction, Flynn provides insights on where the money goes in these countries and what the USA gets from their &#34;investment&#34;. Great read!!
0790729342|5.0|Not alot to say about the Road Warrior that hasn't been said by many others, it is one awesome post-apocalyptic action movie, with Max, his dog and various other interesting characters.  Great action, cinematography, and a cool car, plus great stunts.  All in a story about Max & some unlikely accomplices fighting off a band of depraved bandits.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|I was extremely delighted to hear this new cd was coming out...and more so when I received it.  The music is energetic, fresh...  as has always been true of Jakob Dylan, the lyrics are smart and deep and clever. All the songs are catchy and intelligent;  &#34;Love is a Country&#34; is my favorite of the recordings; never heard anything quite like it.  The melody brings tears to my eyes...Thank you, Wallflowers, for this vibrant and very cool CD!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I've been collecting records for a number of years now and the only thing missing from my collection was Beatles albums.  Frankly I had not been a fan up until a couple of years ago.  So I started looking around and what I found was that it was very difficult to find decent Beatles on vinyl that wasn't trashed, destroyed or way too expensive.<br /><br />So when I heard that they were re-issuing the Beatles catalog on 180 gram vinyl with all original artwork I debated which albums I was going to buy. I was thinking of just getting Revolver and Rubber Soul but then thought I should also have a decent copy of the White Album...but then my copy of Sgt. Pepper is pretty noisy and I should get one of those too.  After doing the math I found that I could get the box set for less than buying all the albums separately and they'd come in a cool box with a decent book included.  I figured if the box set stunk then I could just sell it or the albums separately and make some money back.<br /><br />When I opened Revolver and put it on my turn-table I realized that I wouldn't be returning this set.  This set is exactly what I was looking for.  An excellent quality collection of all of the Beatles albums on beautiful, heavy-weight vinyl and will be a part of my collection forever.  I certainly couldn't find these albums after years of searching through used record stores or eBay in this sort of condition.<br /><br />The record is SILENT and I'm not using any sort of high cost audiophile set up, I'm using a Technics SL-D2 turntable with a Shure M97xE cartridge and an old Pioneer SX 650 receiver.  I'm not sure what the original pressings of this sound like but I do think the bass may be mixed a bit high, sort of modern sounding if you ask me.  Some of the background chords in Tomorrow Never Knows sound more pushed to the back compared with the bass though I may just be used to the mono mix.<br /><br />All in all I'm very happy with this set, every record turns out to be less than $23when all added up which is perfect, I'd have to spend more than that to get good playable copies of these anyway.  May as well get them all at once.  Haven't decided what will happen when/if the mono mixes come available.  For now, I'm just going to enjoy playing these records.

1451695195|5.0|I do not believe in accidents or coincidences.  I do believe in receiving gifts from above.  This book just confirms what I already  believe about Heaven (or the other side).  And it does not suprprise me that the messages keep coming to us to people who have to be almost coverted themselves in order to expand their awareness of spiritual matters.  But it is sad that no matter what the author of this book tries to express of his experience there will be people who won't get it or be helped, but that is OK.  I got a lot of help from this book that included some of his recommedations for other books & Meta-Sync music I didn't know was available. Kudos to Dr. Alexander

I never use Wi-Fi on my phone because the 4g is faster and more dependable than any Wi-Fi that I can find.<br /><br />The only limit on my cell connection is the one that you have configured!<br /><br />Please fix that ASAP!<br /><br />Ron<br />:!<br />!<br />!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Great graphics and I love that there are no ads but.....I sure could use some help figuring this game out.
B007REV4YI|3.0|The reviews flowed in. Best reviewed Bond movie ever. Biggest overseas opening ever for a Bond movie. That just proves a good point: consensus doesn't prove anything.<br /><br />I was the kid who stayed glued to the TV on all the old TBS Bond movie marathons during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I've read a good deal of the source material books from Ian Flemming. But I have no fanatical attachment to either. On the contrary, I just happen to enjoy the simple escapist window Bond opens to an audience.<br /><br />Daniel Craig isn't a bad Bond at all and he's definitely a product of the \\"Jason Bourne\\" generation of action movies of stoic heroes where the Brosnan productions often veered into the Roger Moore fantasy camp - which I actually didn't mind. So the cold and stale touch of Skyfall actually compliments his character, but it can't save the movie from the doldrums it \\"falls\\" into from time to time. Javier Bardem was good, but I think Moriarity in BBCs Sherlock was more of a threat to London than this guy.<br /><br />Plain and simple, Skyfall was expertly constructed, but pretty dry and the narrative was a jumbled mess of pacing. There were undoubtedly great ideas, but none of them were well capitalized on. The pieces never really fit together. It's as if the three writers agreed the movie would star Daniel Craig, then went their separate ways and wrote three different movies then tied them together with string before filming. Even Hollywood fix master editor Stuart Baird didn't tighten this one up very well. There was a lot of shifting in seats and not a laugh to be heard in the theater I sat in.<br /><br />Money Penny, M, Q and the Aston are here to signify that Jason Bourne is finally dead and Bond we all remember has returned. Maybe, but this coming from a book worm with a long attention span: this Bond was boring.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I did enjoy this read not as much as the first, but the story line is progressing and i must admit I was hooked.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a great book. The plot is gripping and it's hard to put the book down. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I really didn't like the ending. But the first 98% of the book is amazing.<br /><br />I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:<br /><br />Books I love or at at least really, really like:<br /><br />We Need to Talk about Kevin.<br />Tell the Wolves I'm Home<br />When the Emperor Was Divine<br />The History of History<br />The Remains of the Day<br />We Have Always Lived in the Castle<br />The Night Circus<br />Water for Elephants<br />The Sisters Brothers<br />The Poisonwood Bible<br /><br />Books I REALLY hated:<br /><br />The Bear in a Muddy Tutu<br />1Q84<br />The Buddha of Suburbia<br />A Visit from the Goon Squad<br />Sun Storm<br />A Long Way Down<br />When We Were Orphans<br />The Haunting of Hill House
B000S9SKZ0|5.0|I absolutely love this book!!  My cousin actually gave this book, and the two following, to her sister, who is my age.  She fell in love with them and convinced me to read them.  It was love at first page!!! &lt;3<br /><br />That was years ago, and now this is one of my go to books to re-read whenever I'm feeling off.  Coincidentally, this book is also how I fell in love with Garth Nix as an author.<br /><br />I don't think I can say anything bad about this book, this series, or this author.<br /><br />Hope you, or whoever you give it to (if it's a gift) enjoy it as much as I did!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|this was a birthday gift and it was the right gift that was given thanks....thanks... now just got to watch the movie
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I actually was quite hesitant and sceptical about this purchase. I do read book reviews in the weekend papers and noted that this book series was popular week after week. So i purchased. At first I thought that the style was very Twilight and I was dissappointed. I am a total Twilight fan and was not happy about a take off on that. However I was very wrong. I actually found I could not put the book down. Very captivating and slightly raunchy. From here purchased all three.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|Movie worked fine but was damaged. This was meant for a gift but because of the damage I decided to keep it for myself.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a very good book. The book is read at one breath - although I wouldn't say it's &#34;easy&#34; reading
B003VANOFY|5.0|Are you looking for a gaming headset that will last for your long gaming sessions? Well, look no further because I found the perfect gaming headset for everyone from serious MMO gamers to casual gamers. The Logitech G930 Wireless Gaming Headset offers comfortable padding, surround sound, wireless connectivity, programmable G-keys, a noise cancelling microphone, and much more!<br /><br />When playing MMOs, people often use Ventrilo or TeamSpeak to communicate vocally with their teammates. Many gamers chose to use a headset and mic combo to do this with. It gives the gamer privacy if others live with them, and the mic helps to make their voice come through better for others.<br /><br />As a MMO gamer, I use Ventrilo, and I've gone through a few headsets that never lasted very long. I have also tried using a separate headset and the internal mic on my laptop, and also a separate microphone. This worked for a while, but it got rather annoying for using for extended periods of time.<br /><br />After using the Logitech G930 Wireless Gaming Headset for about a month so far, I am pleasantly happy with it, and have had absolutely no problems with it. It was extremely easy to setup and use. If you want to listen to something without the headphones, all you do is unplug it from the USB slot. It really couldn't be any easier.<br /><br />It is a comfortable headset to use when it is wireless or plugged in to charge the battery. The cords coil up when not charging, so they don't get in the way and make my desk look messy. The sound is fantastic, and the mic works flawlessly, too. I have fun using the space squirrel voice morphing on my friends, and it also makes me laugh when hearing it for myself.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this gaming headset. It is comfortable, has amazing sound quality, and is quite durable. If you are looking for a headset for gaming, this is the top of the line quality you're looking for. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Disclosure: Thank you to Logitech for providing me with the product for review.

B002RI9SC4|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel. As I did the whole series. I have reread this book twice. Highly reccommended read.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|because it was fun and stress reducing to play.  my friends introduced me to a form of angry birds and I liked it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book with lots of love, romance, and mostly the battle for hunger in the arena and out of it. Must buy!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Waking Up Married is a fun, quick read, and was just the story I needed for a romance fix. Megan goes to Vegas for her cousin's wedding, and after a night of drinks, she wakes up next to Connor, married. She has no recollection of the night before and immediately wants to find a lawyer. Except. He doesn't want a divorce.<br /><br />Connor is convinced that she's the one, the perfect partner, and convinces her to give their marriage a 3 month trial. She finally agrees, but she's determined to show him all the sides of herself to prove that he doesn't really want to be married to her. He's equally determined to show her that she can't throw him, and he's committed.<br /><br />This story was an afternoon escape - I read it in one sitting. The only reason I didn't rate this higher is because even though Megan is independent, smart, and likable as a character... It bothered me that she could so easily uproot her life to move out of state (even if she thought at the time it was temporary) to live with Connor. Besides her cousin, she had no one else in her life.  Where was the best friend trying to talk some sense in her, or, telling her to take a chance?<br /><br />Was the plot predictable? Absolutely. Did I care? Nope. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a romantic, fun read. I'll definitely be checking out more titles from Harlequin KISS.<br /><br />3.5 stars.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Haven't had it long enough to see if it is accurate, but I wish it had percentage chances of precipitation.  That is always helpful when planning.
B003G94BZC|5.0|The play between River and the Doctor is interesting. Love the things River does to get his attention. What a couple.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I watched the 3 disc blu ray version of this film and it was just so disappointing.<br /><br />I found the story to be very thin as well as the supplements.  If you want to see actor/director interviews they are in the 4 disc blu ray version.<br /><br />The look of the film is great but you spent no time with the characters to care about any of them.  I found it laughable when the captain who stayed on the ship the entire time doing very little out of the blue had the 'complete' explanation of the canisters and how they got on the planet and why.<br /><br />It was a 'what?' moment - just like the Engineers.  Theron had a cameo as well as Guy Pierce - they were completely wasted.<br /><br />Alien was a home run out of the park.  Prometheus isn't even a convincing punt.<br /><br />Skip it.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love the way each episode is a cliffhanger and you can't wait to see the next one. If you are not a fan ought to be one!!!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Not really on par with The Lost Hero but certainly superior to The Son of Neptune, but still relies too heavily on deceit to overcome the obstacles along the way. That is, the story almost has you believe that Percy’s group are among the few remaining smart heads beyond the Mist and that they are really lucky to only find gullible enemies along the way.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Angry Birds plus Star Wars? Equals epicness! The only thing is that the hoth update came out today my phone but not on the Kindle Fire.  Keep up the good work Rovio!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|game is really fun and easy to play<br />only draw back are the price of the gems<br />maybe alternate decorations and tables for no gems at the end of the month<br />truly an addictive game to play
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is epic you should get it great game if you ask me it is one of my favorite's you should get it if you are a new User this is a definite buy. peace out
B000GOU4M4|5.0|very funny and interesting movie for Christmas time. A whole family gather together and this is just the one to enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is a shameless copy of temple run with worse controls and graphics, designed to be edgier (spray paint on the app cover) and appeal to preteens. Awful.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The author even admits in the acknowledgemeants that he is lazy and that is how this book seems.  Interesting book, but he basically phoned it in.  The ending is pathetic.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This a great game is fun to play, graphics are fun, really clever game,good for developing problem solving skills. Highly recommend it for all ages.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I paid the $2.99 for Star Wars and now I have to pay for the Hoth update? I don't think so Rovio!
B003L16FAE|5.0|As many times as I've seen this movie, I've never seen it look or sound this good. I know it's bluray, but my God it was awesome!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Probably not my favorite in the series, but if you like the others you will probably find this one hard to put down as well
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am enjoying reading this book.  Having worked in neuroscience research for a while makes me interested in things related to the nervous system.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I happened to find this trilogy here on amazon, and when I saw all three movies, on Blu-Ray for $29? I bought it instantly. I have seen all of the original Batman movies, but I am a fan of these three movies more. The first movie describes how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman and gives a back story to the characters. The second movie, the Joker is introduced, and Batman has the dilemma where he decides if he is done being Batman. The third movie, Bane is introduced, with many new characters. All three of these together make an awesome trilogy that I am proud to own. These movies would appeal to any generation.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This movie takes me back to my childhood. Not only that but looks amazing on BD. Love me some old school Arnold =).
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Good movie with a lot of action. Enjoyable from the start to the finish with lots of realistic action scenes
1423113454|5.0|My son loves this series and the author.  We have all of Mr. Rick Riordans books in the series.  They seemed to be based on Mythology.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|It's a Disney collaboration that revamped the older version. It is a nice &#34;change of pace&#34; in bringing a different perspective to a classic
B009VB97EY|1.0|Poorly done movie. Story line was tired and very cliche. Completely disapponted!<br />I love Channing Tatum but hated this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It keeps you on the end of your chair, cliffhangers you weren't expecting. I would definitely get this book to read
1423136802|5.0|My son loves this series and the author.  We have all of Mr. Rick Riordans books in the series.  They seemed to be based on Mythology.
B008NBEY3C|5.0|Although I had some of Perahia's recordings it has been worth buying this set. There are many recordings I didn't  have and I am already enjoying those recording and widening my reportoire. They are a delight to listen to.The additional video's also enhance the quality of the collection, as does the catologue enclosed.I shall enjoy these recordingd for many years to come. Well done Sony.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I didn't enjoy the movie.  And the movie keep getting dark so I have to push a button on my remote to get it bright again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read this book a few times now and it doesn't get old. I enjoyed the .movie even if I like the book more. A must read for some though I am sure just as many won't. Keep an open mind. Don't want to spoil it but she lives.
B0080K3G4O|4.0|For those who walk around with a scowl on their face all day and hope to find in this book the secret to being happy while being angry, depressed or forlorn, this books will probably not the mark, because there is no mark to hit.<br /><br />But if you're just one of those many people out there like myself who's trying to avoid being angry and upset, but who doesn't buy the \\"be happy and wonderful things will happen to you\\" mantra, this book will be interesting. I say \\"interesting\\" not \\"enlightening\\" because it is a surface treatment covering everything from ancient stoicism to Buddhism to modern-day Santa Muerte beliefs and as such can't possibly be deep enough to be enlightening. It does go deep enough to show the common theme running through many beliefs, that happiness is ultimately related to finding a way to be content and productive in the world as it is, without devoting too much of our energy to struggling against it. The book does not suggest that we not try to better ourselves or the world around us, but does make the point that it is the struggle against our condition that is likely to make us unhappy far more than the condition we're in to begin with.<br /><br />I found this book to be an interesting departure point, suggesting several others that I suspect will be more enlightening, rather than merely interesting.
B000OW77UU|5.0|Movie was great. I had to do a speech on this movie and being able to watch it on my computer the minute I bought it was great.
B005AERS74|5.0|One of the best albums out there. I listen to it daily. If you are a Maroon 5 fan you should definitely purchase this album
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Mark Knopfler's catalogue of artistic ouput stands comparison with any muician of the modern era. Consistently good for over three decades.
0547569653|5.0|Amazing story and awesome recipes. Scott is a ground breaker in the vegan running movement.  I go back to the book for the recipes.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not as good as previous novels.<br /> Predictable and situations that seemed to be like previous novels.<br />Still better than most available.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This is one of Maroon 5's best albums. You should definitely purchase this album. It's nice to just put on and just chill and listen to.
B0086449YA|5.0|This is a consistently excellent collection of songs which compbines Knopfler's continuing talent as a songwriter with muical virtuosity from him and an impressive band.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|All the basics needed, but not as good as accessing the web page.  Still, not bad at all for a freebie.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is by far one of the best novels I have ever had the pleasure of reading! An amazing plot, great climax moments that keep you enthralled and guessing until the very end- A book that I definitely wanted a sequel to! The characters have depth and body and the storyline is beyond amazing! I would recommend this to anyone!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I honestly thought it would be crap based on the topic but it was actually really enjoyable and well done.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This movie is a true classic that I will treasure forever. I will be buying more of Robert Duvall movies in the future.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|You have the ability to configure every detail of your alarm system. I like to adjust the amount of time I can snooze.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a terrible book- the narrator is a complete milk sandwich- whiny and annoying with no confidence who seemingly gets taken advantage of because she has no morals or confidence in herself.  Unless you are a person who likes reading porn with absolutely no story line and a TERRIBLE main character, then you will not enjoy this book.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|5 Stars. The performances are all brilliant. Even the little kids which is unusual. This is actually still in sequence but the past scenes are told more in flashback which makes it far more effective than having them in order as this way you see the effects of the killing first and the movie can gradually build to the final conflict. Every scene is boiling over with tension and suspence even when Kevin is not in the room, but the big question that you take away from this is Did Eva create Kevin or did Kevin create Eva?
B002GIBVWA|4.0|One of the most epic love stories of modern times.A must watch for all romantics I the world .This movie will make you tear up!!!
B0058EBNAO|2.0|I bought this one because it got such great reviews.  I'm not a fan.  I just wanted an app that gave you a weather forecast and had radar so you could see what the incoming rain or snow covered.  Didn't get it.  This one is hard to read and if it has a radar map, I haven't found it.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|A great prequel to the first 3 books- love this series.  It really explained it without reliving the other books.
B009FZFONO|4.0|What a corny concept, yet we are all sucked in because this is so well done. What a great show.
1419705849|5.0|My grandson was thrilled when he found out I had ordered this book for him.  He was happy to be one of the first to receive the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey never disappoints. Definitely worth the price, but thinking of getting Prime so we can watch them all for free. Definitely recommended.
B003IEJZUG|2.0|Although it was an okay novel, I feel there could have been much more done with the book.  The details are immense and I found it difficult to focus and read most of the time.  The time spent on certain details would leave the reader to believe that they would come full-circle at the end of the book; however, at the end, I was rather disappointed.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Great movie with almost no objectionable content.  A family friendly film. would watch again.  The story inspires me not to give up when things look impossible.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|This is a fantastic LEGO set and my son LOVES it!!  He and his friends have spent hours playing with it.  However if you're going to buy it, I would recommend you don't waste your money pay this horrible price of $170.  The list price is $119, which is what it costs at lego.com, or you can pay a little more on the Toys R Us site, but still over $50 less than here.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app. Serves all my math needs. It's free!  Definitely recommend.  Great for all ages. Easy to use and see with large numbers.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Absolutely a great end to the trilogy! It is everything you could have hoped it would be.  The characters have really grown throughout the books and the plot is exceptional.
B004UID2LC|5.0|When I first tried this, and 2 other You Tube downloaders [TubeMP3 Machine, and TubeMate YouTube Downloader] none of them worked on my Kindle Fire. I gave up on them all, till I came across a You Tube video on how to install and use this one. I tried it again, doing what I thought I originally did, but this time it worked like a charm. It's simple to use, the downloads are reasonably quick, they are easy to see on a download list, and play back just like the original when you are off-line so perfect for when you're traveling without Wifi availability. I've got several saved so far, and will no doubt collect a few more as time goes by. I'm not sure how many I can collect, but will see at some point. Highly recommended.
1451695187|4.0|Great read with wonderful insight into what happened to Dr. Alexander. One of the best books like this I've read.
157421327X|5.0|i LOVE IT....and am still using it every day. It has helped me out of many a tight spot . Hope you will enjoy it too. Great $...it  should be one of many of her books you will love.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is an amazing read! Mysterious and looming with a great amount of sci-fi that is believable once you enter Miss Peregrine's home-I found myself enthralled and wanting more! The love story mixed within is heartbreaking and lovely- A high, high recommendation!
1585673927|5.0|What ho? Another set of adventures with Bertie and Jeeves, how could one resist the fun? It is positively charming!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As is typical of any book by Goodwin, this one is thoroughly researched and well written.  If you want to read a book about the approach to the civil war, and the people involved in it, this is a good one.  I highly recommend it.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Highly recommend. Clint Eastwood stars with some very intense acting and his costars are wonderful in their roles. A heart-warming tale with a tear-jerker ending.
B001HNE3NO|2.0|This book was very boring other that the main part of the beginning- after you find out what the title means, there is little to be desired for the remaining book.
B004V5QWU2|2.0|I have used Sound Machines for yrs, some good, some not. Audible gaps in a selection is NOT good. White Noise app way better. No excuse for gaps. Its my key point in an apps quality. Continous, consistent, repetition of mechanical sounds is the whole point. Fans don't skip. Fail and removed.
B009LDMJGA|5.0|An absolute masterpiece of a record album.  It's on par with the last two records which is saying a lot considering the 16 year layoff.<br /><br />By Crooked Step is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time.<br /><br />It's more Superunknown-ish with a good trippy feel.  The angst is still heavy in the grooves, but it's clear that the guys have a much more positive spin on life right now and I think that shines through a little.
B000007XUQ|4.0|I've always loved Karen Carpenters voice and so I bought this for the Christmas season. It is a double c.d. and does not disappoint!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is a great read not only for adolescents, specifically young males, but for everyone.  The 4 part book is a great selection for anyone.  The plot leaves you wanting more and more and the author certainly does not disappoint by the prequel.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|I have enjoyed listening to this album with my family. My children enjoy it it as well. It's perfect Egg Nog music.
B000N3Q1VG|5.0|I have always loved the movie the shining but have never actually read the book, so i decided to get the book to read and it was well worth it.
B009H2PCNC|4.0|I like listening to Eno when I want to kick back and simply relax. It is a different type of music that I enjoy.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter. All I can say is that she is very happy with item. The only thing wrong was that the CD case was broken on arrival everything else is great.
B0030B624E|5.0|Shooting Bill Murray is classic!! Well written and entertaining plot line. I had to watch this movie when I heard Hostess was going under
0062127241|5.0|i bought this book for my old man and he loved the book, he said it was a very interesting read.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I think this is my favorite Eno collection that I own. It is very relaxing music and helps reduce the stress level!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|This was a great movie.  The inside look into Katy Perry's tour and life was amazing to see and its a movie for all to see.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition is a great edition of Minecraft!!! I love it and it's so awesome. I definitely recommend it!
B003MC5L9S|5.0|I got this book cause a friend of me recommend that it was good for your mind. It is easy to read and understand
B007SY3CEW|5.0|Love this game. there are lots of songs to practice on and plenty more for downloading. hours of fun especially if you have someone to compete with.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Took me a while to finally sit and read it but I am glad that I finally did.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app because it really works. It wakes you up on time and I also love that you can choose how you want it to wake you up.
1582701709|5.0|I chose this rating because is a good book to read. I liked this book because it thought interesting things that I wasn't aware. I recommend this book to people that want to change something for good in their lives.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|What's going on Amazon??? The free version on google play has already updated the Hoth levels weeks ago. Why not you!?!?
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son (3 1/2) played wheres the water and loved it, this game is very similar with a couple different game dynamics.  Great game.
B003062NDS|4.0|I remember the Movie have more music in it.  Other than that, I do enjoy listening to it from time to time.
0446677450|5.0|I got this book cause my boss recommended me to read this book. I like it and I learn a lot from it. Specially if you in college or high school you have to read it cause it will teach you a lot good stuff. Best price ever.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This is definitely not up to the superb level of Scott's previous work. Starts with a fascinating story line which very quickly gets completely forgotten and degenerates into a second rate ripoff of Alien 1.
B009SMW9IW|3.0|Ms. Thorn has a beautiful voice and it shines especially on the covers.  However, the songwriting on the newer songs was mundane, poorly rhymed and trite.  However, my husband totally disagrees and thinks the whole thing is fabulous.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun. stuff I never played before. no complaints. please get this game. a good way to pass time.I play all the time. wish I didn't have to write solo much to give it a good review
039472903X|5.0|Fantastic book and tells you how can you became the best in advertising. I recommend this book for people that want to learn more about media stuff.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works awesome, easy to use. Had no problems whatsoever with it yet. Plus its free so you can't go wrong.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I love these Marvel movies...but I wished they had packed more action that them arguing or matters....but I enjoyed it for the most part :)
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Am on the 99th page of this book, and I put it down to write this review. I also needed a break from the tears. So my face is wet as I write this, and my mind is shaken. Safe Haven is truly, Nicholas Sparks at his best. The very depth of emotion springs deep and jumps from the page into something recognisable and tangible and honest. I felt Katie's fear, anguish, anxiety, skepticism, joy, strategy, adrenaline, fortitude, kindness, patience, love...the list is endless. The characters around her, are so real and fitting. And Sparks allows you into the fathoms of their pysches as their stories unfold. Truly wonderful, I am reminded of why I want to write. And I certainly hope that the upcoming film, does this work of art justice. 5 stars! Please, give it a go. I downloaded the sample, and I had to stop myself from finishing it so I could go buy the book. From Katie's voice alone, I was assured that it would be worth it. Before I close, I'd like to give a shoutout to Jo...you, my dear, are amazing.
0316228532|3.0|I'm only half way through this book so perhaps there's something coming that will make me be glad I struggled to get through to the end.  The only reason I've continued to plow through it was the author's obvious literary success with the HP series.<br /><br />To be accurate, I never read the HP series so my only expectation was some of the films that have been re-run on TV.  I did not expect a re-make of HP.<br /><br />Again, half way through, I'm still confused about who the characters are...how they fit into this story...why the whole Pagford vs Fields issue is a big deal.  In other words, the story has not jelled enough for me to care about them.
B007V508CC|4.0|I really thought the previous album was much better, this starts out swinging, but just does not give more than a head bob to the music while listening.  I expected to be dancing in my seat while having the urge to stand up and really get down, but this was pretty good, at least I was moving a bit.
B009JZPH32|5.0|I'm an avid movie watcher--and I love ann genres...I highly recommend this. Even though this one is almost in a category of it's own..I'd say, without a doubt, that if you love movies like Pulp Fiction, Last House on the Left, or Swordfish, you'll love it.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I got this album because I'm a huge fan of Evanescence. The band is outstanding! Amy Lee's voice is stronger than ever and the band is PERFECT to back her up. If you're an Ev fan, you'll love this album. It's a bit different than their older stuff, the music is a little bit harder and it has alot of edge to it. If you're one of those people that don't like how the band has changed and you don't want to give this album a chance, you're seriously missing out on some great stuff!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Has Led Zeppelin ever released anything that wasn't good? I don't think so!<br /><br />The first couple of tracks show that Robert Plant has lost a bit of his upper range, which is completely understandable. However, it seems that after that, he gets warmed up and then they deliver what could truly be described as one of the best live performances that they have ever given!<br /><br />Get this package! You can't go wrong!<br /><br />UPDATED Blu-ray review:<br /><br />This is sure to be the definitive live version that all of their other versions will be compared to! You get to see everything from the back of the arena, to being right on stage with them!<br /><br />Robert Plant still has a commanding presence on stage.<br />Jimmy Page shows us all of his iconic signature stage moves, and no one can play a Gibson double neck the way that he can.<br />John Paul Jones displays his grand yet understated music mastery.<br />And Jason Bonham appears to be genuinely honored to be on stage stepping into his fathers shoes, and never missing a beat.<br />They all definitely look like they are all having a great time playing together again!<br /><br />This Blu-ray video has crystal clarity and brilliantly clear sound. For those of us that were unable to attend in person, this is the next best thing!

B001DUDKEY|5.0|Jane Austen is a favorite story teller of her era, when desire was told subtley.  When duty overcame desire and finally becoming your own person is done with grace and fortitude.  This is a charming tale, and the heroine is not gorgeous and the hero is not another Brad Pitt.<br /><br />The scenes and scenery are rich and authentic, as well are the costumes.  You really go back in time and relive that era, the family interactions, the unspoken feelings, but related with glances and subtle words.  Much more interesting than lets jump in bed....that we seem to have now.

B00697VQEC|4.0|The legend goes that Brian Wilson, inspired and challenged by the Beatles' RUBBER SOUL (ST 2442) LP, tried topping it with [[ASIN:B004P75EJQ PET SOUNDS]]. Then, awed by this latest Beach Boys album, John and Paul one-upped Wilson with [[ASIN:B007EHCNA2 REVOLVER]]. But really, how much truth is there to legends?  (Maybe some. Although \\"Revolver\\" sessions commenced fully six weeks before \\"Pet Sounds\\" was released on 5/16/66, they were ongoing until the 23rd of June.)<br /><br />RUBBER SOUL is introspective, experimental in writing and instrumentation, and demonstrates a creative maturation that wasn't fully possible during the hectic 18 month insanity of \\"Beatlemania.\\" Many of these songs were too complexly overdubbed to be performed in concert. This was one of several factors in the group's choice to stop touring and concentrate on studio work. Perhaps the creation of REVOLVER owes more to that decision than to any songwriting competition with someone 8,000 miles distant. But, legends have a way of living on, don't they?<br /><br />Points off for no liner notes, no track lengths and a couple of sub-par tunes.<br /><br />SIDE ONE<br />[2:04] I've Just Seen a Face<br />[2:00] Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) - (George, sitar)<br />[3:19] You Won't See Me - (Mal 'Organ' Evans, organ; Paul, piano)<br />[2:16] Think For Yourself - (Paul, fuzz bass)<br />[2:42] The Word - (George Martin, harmonium; Paul, piano)<br />[2:42] Michelle<br /><br />SIDE TWO<br />[1:53] It's Only Love<br />[2:26] Girl<br />[2:20] I'm Looking Through You - (Ringo, Hammond organ)<br />[2:23] In My Life - (George Martin, piano)<br />[2:13] Wait<br />[2:21] Run For Your Life<br /><br />TOTAL TIME - 28:39

I am looking forward to reading \\"Mockingjay\\" next.<br /><br />My only regret is that I watched the movie version of the \\"The Hunger Games\\" after reading it, so now the images of the characters I had created have been replaced by Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, and Lenny Kravitz.

0375758992|4.0|\\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" is a sharply drawn, peppery and astringent portrait of a white child's Africa.  Alexandra Fuller writes her memoir dispassionately, resisting any attempts to sentimentalize, as she recounts her family's up and down existence in Rhodesia/Zimbawe and Zambia.<br /><br />I found the book rich in its storytelling, similar to Helene Cooper's more recent \\"House at Sugar Beach\\" , which described a Liberian childhood from the same period of time.<br /><br />\\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs\\" reveals the toughness and asperity of living in Africa, even for the 'privileged' whites.  At times it seems as if the Fuller family has the same welcome in Africa as a plover picking the teeth of a crocodile.  The book in particular focuses on Fuller's flinty and somewhat racist parents, as they doggedly hang on to a memorable but dangerous existence as farmers/ranchers.<br /><br />Fuller is particularly good at conveying the resilience of her family, the oddball humor they shared, and the rich but troubling brew of sensual experience and ramshackle poverty surrounding them.<br /><br />The author provides a nice supplemental reading list in the addendum.

0345803485|2.0|I was on medical leave and had lots of time laying on bed, reading.  It's all the rage these days amongst some women social circles, and I heard someone is making a movie out of it.  I admit that the topic of erotica is the selling point, but the writing is really too simplistic.  Granted that James is a first time writer, it is considered a success for her.  A sweet love story with the touch of hardcore erotica, like S&M and such.  I heard from my reader friends that it would rekinkle some of the sizzles in a steady relationship, but that is too much details to share amongst even friends...everyone is comparing what their hard and soft limits are.<br /><br />The trilogy could have been condensed to one book.  It seems that there are some repeated scenes and I just lost track of time.  It was a drag to finish the third one.<br /><br />On the positive note, the plot was pretty good.  She picked a nice romantic city, picked the right characters, and create enough suspense by adding the family dynamics, friendships and technology elements to the book.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln, directed by Steven Spielberg, from a screenplay by Tony Kushner adapted from the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin, is a truly extraordinary film.  It's exactly what you'd hope for from an Academy Award-winning director (6 nominations, 2 wins), an award-winning playwright (4 Tony nominations & 2 wins, 1 Academy Award nomination, and a Pulitzer) and a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, supported by a cast of some of the most gifted actors working today and an equally gifted production crew with vast experience in every aspect of film-making.  It is, quite simply, a masterpiece and one of the most compelling works to come out of Hollywood in the last decade or more.<br /><br />The film focuses on the critical month of January in 1865, when President Lincoln (a stunning portrayal by Daniel Day Lewis) was faced with a dilemma.  Though the end of the Civil War was now clearly in sight, the South was still fighting stubbornly on, determined to resist until the bitter end, and each month the war continued would mean thousands upon thousands more dead on both sides.  As a result, the desire for a negotiated peace on both sides was significant.  At the same time, the issue of slavery remained unsettled, and Lincoln feared that unless he was able to get the abolition of slavery enshrined in the Constitution before the war ended, his Emancipation Proclamation could ultimately be overturned in the courts.  More critically, if he failed to get the Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery passed by Congress before the war ended, the return of the Southern delegations to Congress would prevent the needed amendment from ever being passed, requiring as it did a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress. The amendment had already been passed in the Senate, but the issue in the House was still very much in doubt, with \\"Copperhead\\" Democrats sympathetic to the South mostly against the bill along with a number of Republicans for whom an end to the war was more important than an end to slavery.  Faced with these pressures and the very fractious political divisions in Congress and even in his own Cabinet, Lincoln decides to press on and gamble everything on getting the 13th Amendment passed before the war ends.<br /><br />One of the things Spielberg does extremely well in Lincoln is bringing out just how complex the issue of abolition was for Americans at the time.  Various groups were for or against the abolition of slavery for a variety of reasons, and in a variety of ways.  Many of those who were against the idea of slavery were also however against the idea of racial equality, finding it morally offensive.  Some who were against slavery were nonetheless reluctant to abolish it out of the fear of what millions of suddenly-free black people might do, while others were afraid of the economic competition such a sudden influx of people needing work might present.  On the other side, many radical abolitionists, personified by their leader in the House, Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (a scene-stealing and very Oscar-worthy performance by Tommy Lee Jones), were pressing for full emancipation, meaning the full recognition of black people as being equal in every way to whites, and were loathe to compromise on the issue.<br /><br />Further complicating the problem was that the make-up of Congress was set to change when the newly elected Congress took its place in March.  Some Republicans were pressing Lincoln to wait for the new Congress, which would have a bigger majority of Republicans, to be seated before bringing the amendment forward, but Lincoln feared the war ending before the bill could be passed.  He also felt that he could use the fact that many lame-duck Democrats who'd been defeated in the 1864 election could be persuaded, pressured or in effect bribed into voting for the Amendment, another potential advantage that he would lose if he waited.  One of the best points about the film is how it shows in a number of dramatic and comical scenes that the old adage about politics and sausage - \\"The less the people know about how sausages and laws are made, the better they sleep in the night\\" - was as true back then as it is today.  It is to Spielberg and Kushner's credit that they bring out all of these complexities without having to resort to tedious blocks of lumpy exposition, and the pace never suffers.  For a film that is two and a half hours long, the pacing is so well done that it actually feels like a much shorter film.<br /><br />Credit for this must also be given to the superb cast.  Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln shows us a very complex woman who is at once a formidable but equally problematic First Lady, defending her husband while at the same time creating problems for him with his political allies with her sharp but too often intemperate tongue.  And adding to the pressures on him by insisting that he keep their eldest son, Robert, out of the war, even as he carries the burden of sending hundreds of thousands of other parents' sons off to the deadliest war in US history.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln plays his role subtly but ably, a young man torn between being sickened by the things he sees in visiting an Army hospital but feeling that he has no choice but to take on the responsibility and the accompanying risks that so many other young men his age have taken on.  David Strathairn does an excellent job as Lincoln's Secretary of State, William Seward, showing a man of great ability and unquestioned loyalty to Lincoln who must contend with the knowledge that Lincoln has been keeping things from him, most particularly his initiating secret negotiations with a Confederate delegation to discuss peace in order to placate the conservative Republicans he needs to keep on his side.  An almost unrecognizable James Spader has a delicious turn as political operative William Bilbo whom Lincoln puts in charge of securing the votes of the lame-duck Democrats by any means necessary.  And Jackie Earle Haley turns in a deftly nuanced portrayal of Alexander Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy and head of the secret delegation sent to negotiate a potential peace with Lincoln, showing a man who at once quietly personifies why the South was continuing to fight on even while knowing in spite of himself which way the winds are truly blowing.<br /><br />There are in fact too many actors turning in fine roles in Lincoln to properly mention all of them, but my absolute favorite was Tommy Lee Jones' delicious - and at times highly moving - performance as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, the staunch abolitionist leader of the Radical Republicans in the House and one of the most formidable verbal duelists that institution has ever seen.  Stevens' ability to verbally eviscerate his opponents - on the House floor and anywhere else for that matter - was the stuff of legend, as Jones shows in a number of scene-stealing moments throughout the film.  Lincoln is bound to get any number of Academy Award nominations, but the one I would personally most like to see is for Jones to be nominated for - and win - the award for Best Supporting Actor, if only for one key moment in the film where Stevens is forced into what is for him a highly distasteful compromise, but one he knows is absolutely necessary in order for the 13th Amendment to win passage.  The turmoil of the moment is etched on Jones' craggy face as Stevens forces himself, almost literally choking on the words, to declare that he is only for equality under the law, publicly turning his back on his many previous calls for complete racial equality.  But when the head of the Copperhead Democrats, Congressman George Pendleton (Peter McRobbie) attempts to goad him into a more revealing statement, Jones' Stevens instead seizes the moment and turns the attack back on Pendleton, not only humiliating him in front of the entire House but actually using him to make his point that all men - even Pendleton,whom he deems \\"more reptile than man\\" - are deserving of equality under the law.  It is a high moment in the film, as is a particularly poignant one that follows later, where we find out why Stevens is so deeply passionate about his cause.  Truly a bravura performance by a highly talented veteran actor.<br /><br />The production crew is equally formidable in terms of the vast array of talent and experience they bring to the film, many of them veterans of previous Spielberg films, like cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (five Academy Award nominations, two wins), film editor Michael Kahn (seven nominations, three wins), costume designer Joanna Johnston, and numerous others.  The production values bring the world and the era of Lincoln vividly to life, from the extraordinary attention to detail given to everything from costuming and set design to the ways in which the camerawork and sound immerse us in the events we are brought to witness.  And John Williams, the almost ubiquitous scorer of many a Spielberg film, wisely gives Lincoln a more subtle musical touch this time around, quietly adding to the atmosphere of the moment but never threatening to overpower or distract from the human events playing out on the screen.<br /><br />But it is on Daniel Day Lewis's shoulders that the heart of Lincoln rests, and he carries the task superbly.  More than any actor who has ever tackled the role, Lewis succeeds in bringing Lincoln the man to life.  The physical resemblance achieved is simply stunning, as if Lincoln himself has walked out of any number of Civil War photographs and onto the film screen.  More than that are the ways Lewis uses facial expression and body language to convey everything from the way Lincoln quietly keeps his own internal counsel as he weighs the issues and the almost crushing mental and emotional burden he carries, knowing that he is the one ultimately responsible not only for every wounded or dead soldier he sees as the war grinds on but also for the future of every black person in America if he fails to secure their freedom before that terrible war comes to an end.  Lewis also manages, quite impressively, to capture the high reedy voice and mixed Southern/Midwestern accent Lincoln was described as having.  What makes his Lincoln truly work though are the ways in which he brings out Lincoln's ability to connect with ordinary people, often through jokes and anecdotes, so often in fact that it provokes a highly comic outburst from Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Bruce McGill) when Lincoln unexpectedly appears in the army's command center:  \\"You're going to tell one of your stories!  I can't stand to hear another one of your stories!\\".  But just as often, Lewis's Lincoln communicates through words that frame the issues at hand with compelling clarity, words that still resonate with us even today, as the film reminds us when it ends with a quotation from his second inaugural address:<br /><br />\\"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\\"<br /><br />In a film destined to pick up a slew of award nominations - and wins - none is more certain, or more deserved, than the ones Lewis will receive for Best Actor for Lincoln.  No performance I have seen this year, or even in any recent year, even comes close.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended, for its masterful performances, for its bringing vividly to life a moment of great historical significance, and for simply being a truly great film.ecessary.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is nothing like Harry Potter though, so if that is what you are expecting then you might be disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  Great way to find new ideas and recipes and a great place to store them so I know where they are at

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great video for when you don't have time to spend doing a workout. Their quick and challenging and you walk away feeling like you got a good workout in and didn't spend an hour doing it. Some of the more expert moves are hard on the knees so if you have knee issues you might have to stick to doing the beginner moves in levels 2 and 3.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Although this book started off on a light note, the second half is dedicated to explaining what keeps an addict in their addiction. It explains why there are no quick fixers and addicts have to be bought to a place of self-enlightenment and self-acceptance before their lives can be turned around. A well worthwhile read.
0345803485|5.0|I hate reading, and I couldn't put this series down. I read all three in less than a week and enjoyed almost every minute.
159668139X|5.0|This book is a great resource for anyone to have to weaves or is thinking they might want to learn. It's pretty much the Bible for the basic stuff. Especially warping the loom which I always have a hard time remembering how to do that from the warping board and it has good photo illustrations to go with the instructions.

B004RGHWIQ|4.0|Movie was awesome, the 3d was truly excellent, lack of specials, etc, was disappointing, the 3d and 2d are on the same bluray.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Fun effects, deliciously evil villains and equally delicious heroes.  What could be better?  There were even some fun surprises, things I totally didn't expect.  Well done.
0345803493|5.0|Criticisms aside, I could not stop reading this. I read the entire trilogy in less than a week's time, and that's rare for me.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|The build here wasn't anything amazing, though I did learn a few new tricks and got to use some pieces I haven't gotten to use in other build.<br /><br />The best part of this set is how amazing the shuttle looks when fully assembled.<br /><br />When I was done, I couldn't help but do a practice launch and landing, complete with satellite deployment when I was in space.<br /><br />This thing just lets your imagination soar.<br /><br />Perfect for any space/science geek of any age!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. the graphics are beautiful and the music is great.  the puzzles aren't to hard to figure out but challenging enough to keep me interested.

B00540G3G6|5.0|Great 3d Conversion of a classic.<br /><br />The 3d is not overdone and feels very natural for at least 90% of the movie.
140053271X|5.0|Glad I splurged on this (which I never do). It is very light in weight, screen is crystal clear, very user interface friendly, and easy controls! The only problem I have run into is trying to have &#34;nook friends&#34;...I haven't figured out how to hook my library up with my friends' nooks...

B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought that this book was pretty good. I did not read the first one, however I did see the movie. After reading the second book you notice that there were some things that were different in the book then the movie. I understood it though. The ending of the book ended abruptly. Kind of like a part one and setting up for a part two.
0345803507|5.0|Criticisms aside, I could not stop reading this. I read the entire trilogy in less than a week's time, and that's rare for me.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great little app, but I would not recommend it for individuals that do not have any computer file multiplication experience. You don't have to be an expert but you do need to know that just because you can do something with a file or app, it doesn't mean that you should.<br /><br />However when all fails, there is always the reset option
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My 3 year old doesn't like it, but my husband and I do. It has a strong message in a funny way.
B004JK61K0|5.0|Great app for checking you email. The price is right too. Recommended as a basic email program. Limited bells and whistles
B004SKLD9A|3.0|Cruel utopian society stories have been written so many times before.  This one doesn't really add anything.  However, it does invent a new fighting technique that may or may not be possible.  During a shootout, the hero keeps twisting his body so that opponents' bullets are most likely to miss.  Of course he could have just hit the floor but that wouldn't look nearly as cool, would it now?
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This takes a little practice and understanding of basic piloting skills. If you have never flown a simulated aircraft [or a real one] before, it's going to take some practice and patience. At lease when you auger in you get to try it again and again and...
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Now THIS makes Fifty Shades look like The Brady Bunch.<br />Not only does Day once again shamelessly copies... eeer, takes free inspiration from entire scenes of the the more (in)famous series but takes the concept of a deeply dysfunctional relationship to a whole new level.<br />I don't think there's much that fazes me when it comes to dominant, abusive badass boyfriends but boy, in this book, I found myself wincing more than once.<br />The relationship between Gideon and Eva is so unhealthily obsessive, unbalanced, crazy and unreasonable, you can't help but wonderi why they insist on being together. Why be obstinate and miserable all the time for the sake of one man (albeit an outrageously rich one, a detail which would give pause to a lot of women but not Eva, since she's already got all the money she wants/needs) when you realize he's so, so bad for you?<br />Beats me. These characters are so profoundly broken, needy, so full of issues, they kinda make you feel good that you're just... normal. My quirks are really just banal if compared to these two.<br />All in all I can't say I did not enjoy the book, I will look for the next and final one without a doubt. Day is a talented writer and I'm amazed at how she takes something which belongs to someone else and makes it so completely hers. If you read YA and are familiar with Armentrout you know what I'm talking about. I can only imagine what these authors could be if only they had an original idea in themselves.<br />I suggest this book to those who thing their love life is messed up. Read this and you'll feel much, much better
B0086700CM|5.0|my temple run is so much fun. I have had temple run for a year. and so has my brother
B00785P2QC|3.0|I love the game.  Great concept, freedom, and continues after closing game. Issues arise if you don't want to post facebook updates or pay for investment points. Your game area is small to start with, and if you want to increase your area, you have to pay. Not gonna happen for me.<br /><br />A suggestion would be to use in game credits to buy investment points. This allows those of us who don't want to pay to continue using the game, even though it may take a long time (500,000 credits for 1 investment point, for example)
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is an amazing addition to the 4-Hour revolution that Mr. Ferriss has been crafting. This book's value is not just in the realm of cooking; This cookbook contains recipes for life. I would like to bring to light a perspective that is not well covered in reviewing this book.<br /><br />In the 4-Hour Chef, you learn to cook while you are allowing yourself to be programmed to look at the world through mental models. These models, that are prescribed by Tim Ferriss, are chosen because of their extraordinary effectiveness in creating a successful and fulfilling life (minimum effective dose, proper sequencing, the Pareto principle, and others). The success of this book revolve around the exercises you complete as you break down, understand, and learn cooking over the course of weeks. This is a more effective method of creating a new way of thinking, instead of just a head knowledge of facts, figures, and quotes. Knowledge in ACTION is power, not just knowledge. This book helps the knowledge become a part of you.<br /><br />This revolutionary book is just another step in what will be Tim Ferriss's legacy. When Tim is gone, we will remember him as the man who helped our countries population start thinking for ourselves, and creating a life that means something to us on PURPOSE. Strange how a cookbook can do this, but I give this book my full endorsement. I do not know what else I could say to support Tim.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is great. I love Percy jackson but I hate the suspense. I cant wait another year for the next book. I hate you Rick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was recommended to me because I love gardening.  The characters in this book had me totally captivated and I couldn't put the book down.  The references to flowers was fascinating to me, but even if I didn't know much about flowers, the story was great.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I got this for a gift for a friend who couln't really understand how our economy got to be so bad and was struggling financially from the impacts. It is a definite eye opener very well narrated.
0553386794|5.0|I'm glad that I decided to read these books after watching the series on HBO. Like usual the show leaves out quite a few details and I've got to know my favorite characters a lot better.
B007704HO6|5.0|What a lovely story of a man and a cat, and how they help each other in their hour of need.  I thought it was extremely well written.  Just shows you can be inspired in many ways or by any one or thing.  The will to live, not just for yourself but for those who love you.  It was a story that needed telling, not just a story of a man who finally kicks his habit, but it's also a story about one very smart and loving cat, and the man he owns.  Because we all know, cats are owners of humans, and not the other way around.  I recommend this story to anyone that is looking for a good inspirational story that will make you laugh and cry, and always smile.  Well done James and Bob!

B004P1JDJO|4.0|A remarkable book on motivation and leadership!<br /><br />Daniel Pink recites various studies and experiments in the field of psychology over the past few decades and from them gathers a view on motivation that radically differs from what companies are doing nowadays.<br /><br />Monetary rewards (after a sufficient baseline compensation) are not only useless, but downright harmful. Instead, real, intrinsic motivation is achieved through promotion of autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly fan of many years and now I finally got it on Bluray, picture quality is incredible, sound is amazing, price was great.<br />The extras are amazing, such insight into Whedon's vision and the actors of the series.

B001EBV0OY|4.0|The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of the most well thought out and intricate movies of its time. Released in 1994 The Shankshank Redemption stars Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins along side Ellis Boyd `Red' Redding played by Morgan Freeman.  When Andy is convicted of double homicide he is sent to live out his days under Wardon Norton in a small imaginary town in Maine. To say the least Andy makes the most of his life on the inside. . Andy with his sly smile and cleaver tactics weaves himself deep into the prisons web of secrets and lies, but the prison is not the only thing hiding secrets. The secrets that are held in books that Andy keeps for the warden are nothing compared to the secrets the lie behind the walls of Andy's very own cell. This movie is so good it is hard to describe in words. It is truly amazing how you pull for each and every character despite their questionable pasts. This movie will have you pulling for convicted felons in a way you never imaged you could. From beginning to end this story brings you back in time right inside those cinderblock walls. It brings you through the friendship, tragedy and ultimately the redemption of Andy Dufrane.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I'm 51 and it was too easy. Perhaps it's meant for children? If that's the case then I'm worried. I had trouble with some of the puzzles.
B0076DEJMO|3.0|Not sure if Joe is resting on his laurels, but this outing I felt left a lot to be desired. After waiting two novels for the return of &#34;The Bloody Nine&#34; we're left with the only character in the book who doesn't get the third person treatment. All other characters give their ideas, thoughts and motivations except Logan. Logan isn't even the main protagonist (another personal let down). I felt the story was really uninspired and, being quite frank, very unoriginal.<br /><br />Written well, but unlike his First Law novels and Heros, where I literally devoured the pages, this novel was oftentimes laborious to page turn.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|This is a great album and is really worth your money and your time. It is a good buy for the price.

B00000ICN5|5.0|I don 't know of a single SRV song that wasn't written well or performed exceptionally. \\"Double Trouble\\" was a perfect back up to the Texas style rock.<br />This is truly timeproof music, where the feet can't stop tapping.<br />If you love timeless music that is performed by the best, lend an ear to SRV & DOUBLE TROUBLE!
1451627289|4.0|I thought this time travel story would revolve in depth around the events of the Kennedy Assassination. Instead, the assassination doesn't take center stage until more than halfway through the book.<br /><br />Without giving away the storyline, while I was disappointed there was not more focus on 11-22-63, I was still intrigued by the story and how it would unfold. The characters and plotlines and symmetry of the story lead to a classic King conclusion; heart-wrenching brokenness with a thread of redemption.<br /><br />I was hoping for a story that focused on what would have happened had Kennedy not been slain. What I got was a story more focused on the years before the assassination that the years that followed. It was not what I expected but the book was entertaining nevertheless.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Product came as described and on time. I haven't opened it yet, it's a Christmas present. Hopefully my sister likes it for Christmas!

B000AM2L1O|4.0|My daughter LOVES her baby. It is cute, looks lifelike, and the beanbag torso makes it floppy and cuddly like a real baby. The eyes close when you lie it down (if you couldn't tell) and it smells kind of like vanilla. The outfit is cute, too. Here is my analysis of this particular doll:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-------<br />- Good size for a young toddler (my daughter is 18 months)<br />- Beanbag torso is nice with the lifelike limbs and head. Makes it both cuddly and realistic looking<br />- Smells nice<br />- Cute outfit<br />- Eyes open and close<br /><br />Cons:<br />-------<br />- Pretty pricey - I think she would have been happy with something significantly cheaper<br />- The hat is very difficult to put on, but very easy to take off. Mommy and Daddy will have to put it on repeatedly as I'm not sure any young child could do it.
0385339585|5.0|Great Read! Must be very attentive to this when making the film! Truly a final testament to the greatness of this writer.
B007MG360G|5.0|Was not to sure about this game at first but I got it free to try it. Played it and turned right around and bought the full version because I love it. I also bought Doodle God and I will get any others that come out. Really makes you think and it is also surprising with some of the combos that come up. Definetly get this one.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is an excellent way to keep your Kindle protected and yet easily accessable.  I think it is worth every penny.
0307944689|2.0|I was really disappointed to discover that the NEW  book I just purchased had all the same texts as the book I purchased four years ago.  No one should bother buying new books regardless of the advertising that says &#34;new edition&#34; since the publishers are just recycling the same old texts year after year.

B008ENA74E|4.0|This book does not warrant the press generated by the oped piece in NYT.  Read this book only to see what life is like at GS by a middling employee.  Having read most books from Liars Poker and due to the publicity, I wanted to read this book.  Greg Smith is a bright student who does great work to get a job at GS and has a solid early career.  Smith careens from telling what it's like to work at GS from intern to middle producer to dissatisfaction.  Along the way he describes the infighting and hierarchy of the managers including some head cases.  Generally there is nothing here: typical life at an investment banking firm.  Cut forward to his disgruntlement and quick departure.  I believe his reasoning.  But, does it warrant a book?  Only due to the the NYT piece.  This is not meant negatively to Smith.  It's his story and he was fortunate enough to tell it.  Good luck to him.
0307277887|4.0|Book was a little warn but over all good condition. Pretty much as described, great book would recommend and pleasant buying experience.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|People form opinions.  When you do what he did with the maid, the opinions will be severe and they won't change.  But is this a good book?  There are many high qualities:  the read about his upbringing and desire to come to the USA, his magical body building career, and early success as an actor.  And, frankly, he does a great job of discussing all his major issues as governor.  So with all these compliments why do I hold back with a glowing review?  The size of this book is just too long.  But also, Arnold glosses over his shortcomings.  He has many fine qualities.  But the ability to look at his shortfalls and really be contrite are not one of them.  So, I commit to a long book and left feeling slightly shortchanged:  enjoyable, supremely enjoyable in parts.  But also a little slow and a little unsatisfying.  Make your own choice.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I'm just learning to play piano and this is a great x-tra way to practice when I'm away  from my piano.
0061474355|5.0|I think I first read Sabriel when I was in seventh grade, and have since read the full Abhorsen trilogy at least five times. The books are even better as an adult, and friends (generally early 20s, male and female) who I have convinced to give them a try have all loved the series.<br /><br />The Old Kingdom is a vibrant, interesting fantasy world, and the magic is a little atypical for a 'young adult' fantasy series-- Sabriel's magic is about binding the Dead, and requires her to travel into death at times to find them. If that seems dark, it is, but the underlying theme is about maintaining the natural order of life and death, preventing the use of magic to disturb it.<br /><br />The writing is simple but the story, setting, and characters are never simplistic, and the story includes some mysteries, battles, and a dash of romance, all at a very fast pace. I truly don't know why these books haven't reached the status of some more famous young adult fantasy titles, because they are every bit as good.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Inspiring film about letting go or everything you know and everything you're taught you &#34;need&#34; in order to be &#34;happy&#34; and finding yourself. Definitely recommend it!
B0086700CM|5.0|You should gt this game it is so fun and it is really entertaining to play soo Playy it kk!.
B007C94XG4|5.0|I purchased this movie on my Kindle for my son and it had kept him thouroughly entertained.  I would definitly recommend this movie especially if your kid is an Alvin and the Chipmunk fan like mine is.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I found the first part of this book hard to get into.  It was depressing and all the characters were at war.  Because it's JK Rowling and I'm a Harry Potter fan, I stuck with the story and was not disappointed.  Once you get thru Part 1 and you get back into JK Rowling's writing style the story comes together.  Actions and consequences throughout.  Really an amazing story.
B005R32L66|4.0|It's ok, but video calls are jerky, lagging, even a I5 16gb memory pc's, and Vizio, Android tablets with 32Gb memory, all having access to a 30+ cable speed network. But it's a novelty.
1451695195|5.0|Well written with strong credible support!!!  I am glad more and more trustworthy information such as this is available to open our eyes, minds, and hearts.  I have shared, and recommended, this book with my family and many friends.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Like I said above this is a old but really good movie I loved watching this when I was a kid.<br />It's when Dorthy starts having these dreams about Oz . So her aunt and uncle start to worry about her for some reason I guess it's odd for kids to have dreams about strange things when ur a kids back then.<br />Right so she has strange dreams so her doctor has her go to this hospital where they can help her get ride of the dreams but while she is there a little girl brakes her out and they run away only to get trapped in a storm separated and Dorthy goes back to Oz only to find that everyone has been turned to stone and there is a evil witch running things. So Dorthy has to find away to stop the witch o and there is a goblin king not sure how he fits in but he is there non the less.<br />So she stops the witch, goblin king and saves OZ then goes back home.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It was fast moving, awesome....it even gave insight to people who suffer from SIB's (cutting).  I didn't want to put the book down.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Great album, love the grittiness and Brittany's voice is amazing!  This was a good purchase & I'd recommend to others who enjoy a sort of soulful rock sound.
B004G6TD8Y|4.0|It is a good concert. However I had in mind the original recording and I was surprised with the recording.<br /><br />This is a live concert with a CD with a similar cover to the original LP.  I did not see that it was a live concert and not the original source of the material.<br />Not exactly the same sound-image that I remember, different, but still good.
B0099G3I96|3.0|I really, really wanted to love it.  I love No Doubt...but this album just doesn't do it for me.  The first couple times I listened to the album straight through, I thought...yea, I do like this.  But now, when it pops up in my mixes I find myself skipping the songs.  There's a couple good ones I enjoy, but overall I'm disappointed.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed this trilogy until the last episode, I know it is science fiction but when I got to the last episode it was just too unbelievable. The main character went from being a brave soul to someone who was always whining. On the whole though, it kept my attention in that I wanted to read how it could possibly end in a good way.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love it so far, just gotta stick with it!  If you are outta shape at all...yea it's not easy, but that's the point!  I feel like I got a good work out in after I do this dvd.  I will say, her little stretch part at the end of part one isn't enough for me, but that's easy enough to remedy.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|By far the best pocket knife sharpener I have ever used. Two different stones to hone down the blade sharpness. Just a few strokes and a knife is like new. Take another few more and even the dullest blade is ready to shave with.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Goose bumps. Amazing. Glad they stuck together rather than split up.  I think they compliment one another.  Can't believe they are so young.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars. Every single one of them. Blu-Ray. Need I say more? Even the older original movies look like they were shot with HD cameras. Tons and tons of special features if you are into that sort of thing.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Everything a new photographer could need! This backpack has pockets, dividers, zipper pockets, straps for a tripod and even a nice spot for a jacket. This came free with my T3i Canon setup, similar packs are around 50 bucks at Best Buy or your local photo store. Great Value, High Quality and useful!
B0064BWDRW|4.0|This one was different from his normal style, with &#34;train of thought&#34; elements, which I found unnecessary at the start.  They ultimately filled in details, but made the general flow a little confusing.  Once into the book though it was as difficult to put down as the others in the series - and with a cliff hanger ending that leaves the future very ambiguous...
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Great book and great characters!  Loved the setting - Paris!  Was a nice change and a great read!  Would love to see more YA set in Europe!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great story line of a young girl showing her bravery and independence! The animation and attention to detail were amazing. I was mesmerized to the screen.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|When I got this movie I thought it might not be so good it was a pleasant surprise. I recommend it strongly
0790729393|4.0|Far more violent than I expected, but I really liked the story and the acting was superb! Of course, I'd expect that of Hoffman and De Niro, but the young actors were also excellent.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This thoroughly enjoyable yarn will delight all those who love the art of storytelling with a big dose of irony and comic twists.  It will be especially appreciated by adults with young hearts and open minds.  Don't bother with this one if you insist upon the standard fare that continues our society's worship of criminals and high body counts.  No guns, no blood, no scumbags.  This is a rich tapestry of young love and some really interesting adult characters who support a twisting and turning adventure story.  Your reward will be collected when the young heroes conclude their quest.  However as wise connoisseurs of great storytelling, we suspect there will probably be more adventures to come – they are just those kind of people.  Will they live happily ever after?  Yes, or at least their version of happiness.  And you will too.
B000IZC7WG|4.0|Outstanding flick that is extremely unique.  Very cerebral.  Highly recommended for anybody who likes those types of movies. All-in-all....great movie!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|An amazing story that keeps you engaged without pause.  It really needs to be read to be believed.  Unfortunately the plot gets even more complex and almost all of the characters in the book get their say.  Not for the faint of heart, it definitely takes determination to get through.
B009LA1R34|5.0|Truly the best CD of her career, yet! New music, new tone, new reason to love thalia all over again. Simply the best!
1401233791|5.0|This is an amazingly complete (for the most part) story that is amazing to read.  I enjoyed every part of it, and can't wait to keep reading.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|David Foster, Rod Stewart, Michael Buble, Ella, Cee Lo and others get together to make the Season's favorite! Old style orchestration with today's technology makes for an instant classic!
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Pros:  Usually pretty fun, good Lego pieces chosen, well organized.<br />Cons:Some of the cards are hard to distinguish and would benefit from being labeled, clearer rules or suggested rules needs, more Lego pieces.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I tried to down load this to my phone while on a long road trip but it wouldn't down load. After reading the reviews I'm glad! Sounds like it has full length commercials.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This has been my all time favorite Christmas movie since I was  kid and anyone can watch it and find it hilarious. There is no Christmas without this movie. :)
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I remembered this movie from childhood and bought it.  Then I invited friends to a potluck and they brought their dogs!  We had a great evening!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I love this movie!  It is definitely one that I will watch over and over and over again!  Based on a true story and it is wonderful that the actual family, including Michael, are shown at the end! Heartwarming is the word that comes to my mind!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Own Two for Two different pc's.<br />One I've had for over a year still works like new And looks like new.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I don't normally write negative reviews but his one deserves it. I have followed Diana Krall's career since I first heard (and saw) her on TV during the Newport Jazz Festival in the late 90s. She is a true Jazz musician - fantastic piano chops and can bend a phrase around the notes like Frank Sinatra. She is nearly always compelling to listen to.<br /><br />But this one's a stinker. As a matter of fact, everything T Bone Burnett puts his hand to sounds like this. It seems to be the formula - take a competent artist, ignore his/her talents, add a plodding bass drum and heavy handed mixing and presto - a new T Bone album.<br /><br />I buy a lot of music, typically on LP (like this one). This is the first album I bought this year that I wish I could take back. It is that bad. And the remarkable cover doesn't save it - I already knew Diana was stunningly gorgeous. I also knew that she was a stellar musician. Let's hope she gets back to her roots.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really liked this book. Just need  less fowel language.Looking for ward to the 3 book. The twist and turn keep  you wanting more.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|After setting up an analog system in a dedicated listening room a year ago I set out to recreate a great LP collection. I had virtually nothing left from 'back in the day' so it has been a blast, especially buying new well made copies of old favorites. But the Beatles had me flummoxed - I could not afford to buy old copies that were of a high enough quality to compete in my system. I cried out for Apple to re-release the whole catalog.<br /><br />And they did. I am not a die-hard fan but the Beatles provided a soundtrack of my youth. I do not own 12 versions of Sgt Pepper's... I own one on vinyl (plus a 2009 CD). I just wanted to be able to spin Beatles vinyl in well-produced, pristine vinyl. And now I can.<br /><br />There is far too much controversy over the 24/44.1 blah blah blah. I am hearing MORE detail, MORE music and enjoying the Beatles MORE than I ever have since I first heard the Fab Four in 1966. These LPs are a treat. In almost every case they are the best recording the average guy can go buy and actually play. They sound, on my VPI Traveler / Grado Gold-1 and previous Music Hall mmf 2.2 / Shure M97Xe, far superior in every way to the 2009 CDs that this mix came from. That's the appeal of vinyl to me - even in digital mastering the end result can work and work well.<br /><br />So let the hard-core Beatlemaniacs have their fits. I could not be happier with this set, the quality of the vinyl (it's not QRP level of quality - but then, what is?), the packaging, and the price. And I haven't even opened the book yet.<br /><br />If you want to relax and spin Beatles vinyl on a decent system you will thoroughly enjoy this set. If the iPod is your idea of music reproduction - maybe not so much (and yes, I own an iPod, and Apple TV 1 & 2, and burn everything digital to iTunes). Buy it while you can.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The plot is good and well me and my husband have had alot more sex and trying new things in bed
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I got this for my husband who is a die hard Alien fan and he absolutely loved it! Great purchase!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book kept me in suspense and turned me and my husband in to newly weds. Sleeping in the raw most night and loving it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was wonderful and I was happy to see that Percy was back in the mix of things. I also liked how the author continued telling the story from the different characters perspectives. It had a very good cliffhanger which I always enjoy and I am thoroughly excited to read the next book.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|great album, in the line of lita ford or joan jett. I loved it. I didn't think that rock like this was made anymore.
B00280LYIC|3.0|The book was written down towards too low of an age level in my opinion and could have been more adult based rather than childish. However, the book displays a very interesting concept of Greek mythology and legend that I always enjoy reading about.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was really well done and concluded nicely in a little bow tie.<br /><br />I bought this to finish out my girlfriends collection of all the other Harry Potter movies. Worth the cyber Monday deals to get also!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Comparatively, this book is the best of the Olympians series. The book entails more action and plot discoveries than before. Also, as Percy Jackson grows older so does the maturity of how the book is written.
B00005JLZN|5.0|The first time I watched this movie I did not pick up on any of the clues that lead to the ultimate end of the movie.  I won't say anything more since it would give the whole thing away.  But, whatever side of the death penalty debate you're on, it is worthwhile to watch.  Kevin SPacey gives a great performance as well.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|This book was still a very interesting read but I had a little trouble connecting with the new characters at the beginning of the book. However, as the book progressed onward I enjoyed learning more and more about the new characters and the roles they would be playing in the upcoming series.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I'm glad to see someone has come up with an improved alarm clock.  Alarm clocks haven't changed for generations, till now.  This one took the frustration out of waking up for me.  To shut this alarm off you turn on the Kindle, swipe, then touch &#34;off&#34;. You can also touch &#34;snooze&#34;.  I know it sounds like a lot to do, but its better than hunting for the tiny button on a regular alarm clock, and I've looked at hundreds of alarm clocks only to be disappointed that they all turn off that way.  On this alarm clock the off and snooze are big and easy to see.  The musical gongs you wake up to are loud enough, but not abrasive, and its actually pleasant to hear them while you go through the steps of turning it off.  I haven't checked to see if you can wake up to other sounds.  I like the gongs so much I didn't bother to look for other sounds.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I found this book very good becouse of the facts of history.  I did find it hard to read due to the early English language, but I had trouble putting it down.  I did see the move &#34;Lincoln&#34; during the reading of the book and found it more enjoyable.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is the short lived series created by Joss Whedon, director of the hugely successful Avengers movie. This series meet its unfortunate end too soon because as the episodes suggest there are plenty more adventures in store for the crew of the Firefly class ship named Serenity. The movie &#34;Serenity&#34; is a follow up project resulting from the show's cancellation and is the best follow up to this complete series set. As an aside, I watched the Serenity Movie way before watching this series and was pleasantly surprised how much this show expanded on the relationships within the small space-craft.<br /><br />The High Definition graphics were a bonus and transition well to the current standards.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not a fiction reader but this kept my interest.  The action comes at the right time and the possabilities are endless.  What a stort.  Felt as if I was there.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Can't wait to read the rest. The Nigel really help bridge gaps in the game. Extremely well written, would definitely recommend to any who has played or is thinking of playing the games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read all three books and had trouble putting them down.  I am not a fiction reader but truly enjoyed these books.<br />Action happens at the right time that kept me wanting more.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Imax makes it rock even more. Babe index way below par. Action is as good as it needs to be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|had to keep reading untill all books were done.  Action is very good and the need to find out what the ending is keeps you wanting more.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a real Grisham fan! For those of you that have similar passions, this latest book from John Grisham will not disappoint. The great thing about Grisham fiction is how believable it is!  To me, that is the key to writing good fiction. You can really believe that the story actually COULD be true. Such is the ability of John Grisham to weave a tale. The Racketeer will keep you engaged from cover to cover.
0525953728|4.0|i liked this book in that it described what the navy seals are all about--and exposed the burocrats in washington--<br />i could not detect any secrets reveled--i cannot understand what the pentagon was so upset about.
