B00NLS7T3Y|4|Great jacket, keeps you warm, has lots of pockets and is true to size. Only downside is it looks like a crossing guard jacket.
B000EDOT7I|5|product is as advertised
B00J1TK1DM|1|Looks better online than in person. It's cheaply made. Has many chips in the clear coat. It will not last long. I would not recommend
B0053ZNMDE|5|better than the messy liquid kind and just as strong
B0002Z9O8C|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00029XH36|1|Product is garbage
B004G9VIXE|5|Watched a youtube video on how to replace this.  Pretty easy.
B008G26ZGW|5|I installed this new pair of headlight assemblies on my 2004 Impala SS and they make the car look so much better as well as give me better night illumination. They look so good that I will need to replace the fog lights now so there is not such a visible contrast in the lenses. Installation was VERY easy. I looked at the Youtube video from A1Auto as well to make the process even quicker. I didn't need to figure anything out after watching that. I would not have guessed to remove the front cover to easily find the second headlight release.<br />The assemblies came with new bulbs that I tested immediately after installation. Low beam, high beam and parking lights worked perfectly after the replacement. If you need new headlights for your Impala, these worked great, fit very well and are VERY easy to install (Thank you Chevrolet). My previous lenses were obviously well worn and the original assemblies had both cracked so moisture was well inside both of them so scrubbing down the lenses would not work to make them clearer.  The new rubber gaskets seal well on the metal fenders and the bumper without issue.
B00JEUHSXY|5|I can not believe how nice these mats are compared the price to the other big brands.  I had never heard of Rugged Ridge and hadn't had a Jeep for many years.  The quality of these mats are outstanding and they have a unique texture that surprised me as they are pliable and easy to remove to clean when needed.  The Michigan winter will be the tell tale, final test and I expect that they will protect more than any other mats I have owned.
B00H9JRI96|5|Excellent hitch. Easy to install
B00IXW0H3W|5|Correct part for my Allison 1000.
B0083C4C6K|5|Nice!
B00DGU98VS|5|received my order in a few days very please with leadersrpm thanks.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great quality.
B0080D6YCW|5|PERFECT FIT
B00H58C89G|5|As a police officer I had difficulty buckling the seat belt since the OEM buckle rode directly below my holster. This extender now positions it beside my holster and makes it so much easier to buckle up.
B00NTR458Y|5|Got this as a gift from a friend, I am extremely happy with it. He used this product from Exlight and was impressed with its functionality and power handling. As I was looking for something like this, he gifted me this. Really a great product from Exlight!
B00AC6YTWW|5|This is an all in one wiring kit for the 14 inch ape hanger install on my 2009 Ultra Classic.  I installed the extension wiring kit and they work perfectly, easy to install, easy to use, and my controls on my switch housing work great.  Highly recommended.
B001EAQTRI|4|Great item. I tested it out with my radio to see if it solved my buzzing, whistling and ground loop problems when my phone was plugged simultaneously into my aux port and charger. Worked GREAT. I then violated any implied warranties by cutting off the ends and installing it behind my dash, inline with my auxiliary extension. Be Aware This Item has Polarized Inputs; follow the sticker's directions: Input is Input and Output Is Output. if you hook it backwards it will diminish your sound quality. mine came similar to what was pictured, with exception of a blue/gray label.
B002YKQNL4|5|1st time I bought them was for a 07 Toyota Tacoma and the 2nd time is for the 90 Toyota 4runner.. definitely recommend it
B00BJ4EMGO|4|good price
B00267PZUK|5|This tool is worth its weight in GOLD!  Easy to use and worked perfectly.  Removed two broken spark plugs with ease.  THANKS!
B0002V9IFU|5|This is the only product that I will use to clean my leather seats. They look like new every time I use this.
B00353PWAW|5|Works well
B0000AZ8LU|1|Very weak, bow out of shape very easy. Won't hold the arch. Need to wrap tape around the metal adjuster so not to tear your boat cover. Not the quality I expected. Would not recommend. Packaging was good though.
B00A7MKVW8|5|So far working nicely with my Nissan Maxima 2004. It is Valeo alternator which is remanufactured and has 2 year warranty.
B00KV15J0E|4|Great color match. Not something I could install myself with a professional looking outcome, though. I found a shop that installs vehicle headliners that put it in for me for only $75, so it still came out to be an inexpensive solution. What a difference it made on the look of the interior of my 2007 Honda CRX EX-L!  Excellent customer service from seller!!!
B00DJ5KGRU|4|best bang for the buck
B005DUQ6BY|5|Sweet lights. These do work for the older series scion Tc's. I've had them in for about 2 months and every light is still funtional.
B002WIFJL8|5|This is awesome for my license plate.  It adds more frogs to my little green car!
B004UM6DLE|5|This stuff stinks, but man does it work. Love it
B00NP82K7U|5|Nice product and prompt delivery !!!
B0002JMF98|5|works fine.
B00NGFP5S8|3|Was missing the hardware to attach to the Jeep as advertised. Amazon fixed and I went with a different brand.
B002O1P9SG|5|Fog light arrived fast, was easy to install and works as well as the original Audi light at a much better price.
B006X98A7C|5|Perfect.  Flawless. Good price.  Even recycled my old one.
B00EC0YL2C|5|great value for the price
B008YGMH80|5|Very well made,good chrome finish,and any &#34;safety chrome&#34; for my Road Star I'm for it.
B004U535F8|2|Not great fit
B0031G8GME|2|I bought this just under a year ago and it recently stopped working.  I gave it two stars because the ease of installation and instructions was very good.  Last weekend I noticed that the running lights on my trailer were not working.  Brake lights and turn signals worked fine.  After some troubleshooting I found that the running lights pin (brown wire) had a constant 6 volts.  When I attached a test light to the pin the voltage dropped to zero.  I suspected a short or some other problem in the powered module.  After digging my way down to the connector inside the vehicle I verified that the ground, which I had to install to accommodate the T-connector, was still in good condition to rule that out.  After that, I probed the pins on the factory vehicle connector and found the voltage on the vehicle connector to be working properly.  I believe this confirms a problem in the powered module so I am going to pursue a refund or warranty replacement.  UPDATE 8/7/2015 - I just got off the phone with CURT and they couldn't have been more helpful.  I explained the situation and the troubleshooting I did and he is sending me a replacement with a postage free return sticker as well.  Couldn't have been easier.
B004OHTRE0|4|works great and easy. arrived when promised and in good condition
B001PSN2LA|5|I have been using this product for years. I started having trouble finding it in stores. It is a really nice detailer. This detailer has some substance to it and puts a good shine and protection on my trucks paint job. I regularly use it to keep the paint on my 2001 Silverado looking new.
B00AVM6H90|5|Perfect match for my 2005 Odyssey. I put off touching up the paint, worried it wouldn't look right. This was exactly what I needed to give my old car a nice face lift
B00TUDPXQ4|4|Does a decent job cleaning and conditioning.  Does leave the leather a little sticky though.
B00QAYCN82|5|EXCELLENT heavy-duty product with only a minor problem in my particular case.  The bolts that were included with my package were not threaded for my Tahoe although the order was specifically for a Tahoe (possible packing error?). I was able to use the bolts that were already in the relevant locations of the vehicle's frame, though, and the hitch & wiring look and function GREAT!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought it.
B000K05U1O|5|Absolutely perfect! Timely delivery, exact match to old speakers and good price. Couldn't have been better.
B000FPXVOW|5|Perfect fit for 1999 Jeep Wrangler. Had to remove the included plastic pins, my doors use a channel to secure the seal to the door.<br />No problems.
B00EVQIA3I|1|I ordered a switch that was suppose to be 120-150psi but the item I received is 110-145psi.
B000AM8BLI|5|Exactly what was promised, and is working well.
B000CO7QLK|5|A+
B002MEH28U|4|Fit perfectly, mirror looks slightly different from the original in its color if that makes sense. At higher speeds it does vibrate more than the original but for $200 less, I can live with it!!
B008X02KL6|4|Fits good and all the noises are gone. Had to file one spot on both struts to fit the brake lines. Easy install at half the price of the big name brands.
B001JT5S8U|5|Great product
B000TYQB1Y|5|Perfect! The transmission was shifting weird and the speedometer would drop to zero at random. 2 screws and 1 electrical plug and the part was replaced. Works great and everything functions normally now.
B005C5FG9I|5|Perfect fit.<br />Make sure to read the Mfg. instructions to install the front fender flares.<br />Use a pair of players to help pull the pins snug.
B00IUEV232|4|Installed myself with some amount of frustration but works great.
B00PMLFD4U|1|This product is a $400.00 pile of crap. Good luck trying to hook it up to a WIFI network.<br />Save your money and buy the USB version. After 3 frustrating days of trying to get this POS to connect to a properly set up wifi network, I finally ended up using the USB cable anyway!<br />Software is pure crap, and there is no easy guide to help you select the proper software package to use with it. Also, the maintenance reminder reset will not work with a Android tablet or phone.<br />For a product that costs as much as this does, it's just not worth the hassle to set up and try to use. Buy the USB one.<br />UPDATE: I just spent three very frustrating days trying to remove a simple service reminder. Using my Android phone; I received a &#34;Updates Available&#34; dialog box.  After selecting it I then received a &#34;Start Update&#34; dialog box.  After selecting it, my phone showed a 87% download, and then I received a &#34;update failed&#34; warning. This completely froze the Android app, rendering it useless. I contacted Hexcode after reloading their app 3 time and getting the same results. Their response: You have a bad WiFi connection! My WiFi router is 4 feet away from my phone. It's a Comcast xfinity 2.4 gig router. Yea, my problem, not their crappy update software.  I had to use my laptop with a USB cable to finish the update, (which was a firmware update to the unit, not a app update). Why did I spend the extra $100.00 for this crap!
B00VLBGVL4|5|I attached these to my crash bars on my BMW 1200GSA, and then I went on a 4500 mile road trip...they were completely awesome. Sturdy, easy to install, non-slip rubber, customizable orientation. When I was doing research it was hard trying to find good information about 'reasonably priced' highway pegs, so I want to make sure that others know my experience with these pegs. The only thing I don't know about entirely is if they will stand up to the test of time, I don't worry much about rusting considering they are painted, but I've gone through a ton of storms and I never put a cover over the bike.... so they look good so far. If someone wants a photo then lemme' know.
B00R26RCVK|5|Work well for quick on & off after sweaty bike ride
B000MGWM62|4|A little big for my grips, they keep sliding off. nice quality and workmanship.
B000XBGXZ2|5|Just the right size to save water in your shower.  We water plants with it.
B00C309SVW|5|Worked great on my 98 sporty 1200 under mounted sick little bastered mirrors give your great a great aggressive look
B004RCRS9I|5|Great brush. Covers every angle and the brush is delicate on the paint. I like it.
B00PF272W2|5|Follow the included instructions and you too will be impressed!  Customer service from BooYah clean is great and the products match the service!  I'm a car nut..  I have every microfiber known to man and these definitely rank in the top two!  I will definitely buy again when the time comes.  Heaven only knows when that will be cuz these things are awesome!
B003ZATW42|5|Very fast and easy way to protect your vehicle
B000MLF7CS|5|Excellent product.
B000CITK8S|5|Great little charger. Does everything it's advertised to do very well. I love how it came with two quick attach leads. Only complaint that with my deep cycle batteries when they are quite drained it takes at least 2 days to charge.
B002XM5G70|5|Great pump delivers consistent pressure.  Super easy installation, comes with barbed and threaded connections for every application. 10x more quiet than the old flojet I replaced.
B00U9YWUGY|5|Easy to apply to my car. Sticks PERFECT. No concerns or complaints.
B011B25IXY|5|Fast delivery and very soft mitt, perfect for washing a special car.
B00199BXXY|1|Did not work wound up buying Orem parts
B006W5NVEO|1|bought 8000ks. hooked me up and they appear 4300k, very yellow, more than my 6000ks. too late for return. caveat emptor. buy a better brand.
B00IYZ6W14|4|Covered pretty good not perfect but does its job!
B00FB3GDXE|5|Received a day early then what was posted & I love it !!!
B00NIR0W82|5|perfect match ! Will order another one for my next car, superior than WeatherTech
B00L4FLUVI|5|Fit perfectly!
B000GVM7CM|5|This lock was a perfect fit and looks seamless with the handle. The instructions were clear and concise making the installation only take about fifteen minutes.
B005ERW92Q|1|Horrible product, fits the car perfectly., but only lasted 3 months.Will not continue to buy from this seller.
B00FQPS8AI|5|This product came the next day I purchased it. And it have prevented my car from a serious bumper crash. Great item for cars like mine.
B00UZ4NG3Y|5|K & N is known for it's high quality re-usable filters.<br /><br />I purchased this for my 2011 Hyundai Elantra. It fit perfectly!<br />Please note- you cannot use the tray that the disposable filter sits in and you also cannot use the cover that sealed in the old paper filter. Remove those and simply slide in this replacement filter.<br />That's all there is to it!<br />Very happy with this cabin air filter. Saves me money and my air doesn't smell like stinky gym socks!
B001GLSIKG|5|I have bought this product a couple of times before on Amazon and have been very satisfied every time.  We have used it starting our car, chain saw, weed whacker, and riding lawn mower.  We like that Amazon's prices are bettert than we would get in a brick-and-mortar store here in Montana.  And,we live in a remote area - free delivery to our door with Prime makes getting things here very convenient.
B00DLMHQGU|1|Everything from this company is awful. I bought 2 sets of headlight bulbs and one set of foglights. One set of the headlights arrived broken and the other set flickers and sometimes doesn't come on. The fog lights melted all the chrome off of the inside of one of my lights and then blew. The other one seems ok though. 1 out 6 of the bulbs works.
B00OU2S6ZK|5|Thanks
B002P8JHSQ|4|good product
B00LFZS77M|5|This was exactly what I was looking for!
B0096CJBXU|4|I will be fair with this particular cargo area mat even though I rave about the same brand floor mats purchased at the same time.  There is no question that these are the best mats I have ever purchased despite being less expensive that some of the bigger brand companies.  I will mark it down a star ONLY because my wife complains that the edge of the mat can fold up if placing a heavy object in the cargo area of her Jeep.  She has a point as I have seen it happen, but for me, it wouldn't bother me as much.  If I had any suggestion for this company, it would be to make the cargo mat a little more ridged.
B00DSVMCUE|5|I was very impressed with the quality of this vest.
B00JREPRJE|2|Very poor fit! They are loosely fitted on the 15&#34; factory rims of my 2013 Prius. I am worry, one of these days, one of them or all of them will come off while the car is moving.
B000BOKML2|5|Works great
B000UV8FRE|5|I love this product! Looks great on my car! Easy to install.
B009OBVS20|5|It works just as described but don't think you are going to compound your whole car in one day with this. This best left for smaller areas, doors or single panels and leave the big jobs to the big boys.
B00AFEPMB8|5|Worked fine
B000CFRFE2|4|perfect
B000COBT68|4|nice for the money
B000E4PNC2|5|This mirror arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and there were no hassles with the product ordered. I was able to install this mirror in about 45 minutes with the help of an auto repair book that can be found in most local libraries, or any auto parts store.
B002P8B93C|2|Called Ford for the correct replacement part was given the part number for this item but it did not work. 98 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer edition
B00O6MBS3G|5|These are better than original ones....the color was bright and they looked great.
B0049ETDT2|5|Same as the factory installed one for our 2002 Durango.
B000C5I2YO|5|perfect!
9539751047|5|Love it!!! Perfect size to put on all 3 of my kayaks
B00KTJ7ZXW|1|This does not work at all you sold me something that does not work
B000EOEVNO|3|fit like oem
B006VZ4KP4|5|ordered as a spare part for future use.
B0007N20US|5|Nice
B001Y8XV8U|3|worked great looks good
B005BN46TM|5|good product great value
B00SUS1RN8|5|Prompt shipping. Excellent quality switch  and cover. Just as good as military surplus that I have.
B00DFMFYCO|5|I just put it on my car yesterday and was very easy only one little buble and i got it flat.
B00GBVHPNW|5|Definitely my favorite biking gloves, when it it warm that is. Only thing is I have to switch to leather when it gets too cold
B0027K41QU|3|It works, but the yellow hose leaks and the high side quick connect is already falling apart. For the price it is alright, but I would spend a few more bucks and get the pump and manifold from harbor freight.
B0052SF0LO|3|I loved this light for my garden but even after taking it in for the winter it failed after a year.  It had a great light and was wonderful while it worked but I will try a different brand.
B001JT5JVQ|5|This is more than a spray wax, its a detailer/spray wax. I often use this as a quick detailer to wipe away bird droppings, bugs, and dust. I also like to apply this after a good car wash for durable protection. My car shines like a gem, including the trim, glass and chrome. Not only does this product shine, but it also beads water like crazy, similar to rainx. With regular use of Lucas Oil, you could almost get away from using paste wax. Great product with the smell of bubblegum!
B000E8UZ94|5|2each Gabriel G44459 Ultra Strut Cartridges are needed to do a complete front strut repair on a GM &#34;W body&#34;... in addition to...<br /> 2each Gabriel 142143 Strut Mounts (top) ; 2each Gabriel 143060 Front Strut Cushion & Bellows ; Gabriel 143036 Strut Mount for the left side lower spring seat ; Gabriel 143037 Strut Mount for the right side lower spring seat ;<br />1 pkg of 2each Moog K6641 Front Sway Bar Bushings (on control arms) ; and some new Ball Joints.
B00H3TMIT2|1|Piece of !@#'
B000WEKPRM|5|These are made especially for my make and model car. You can order for your own car. I don't ever want to go without rain guards. Great to use to vent your car of heat w/o risking drenching your car. Paired with a CoverKing sunshade to reduce summer heat even further.
B0009IQZFM|5|Good perfect for my jetta
B001OCXI2U|5|Works well for the 2nd Gen Tacoma rail system.
B000CB0KNO|5|Fit to perfection in my 1989 Jeep Comanche. The tension is great. The last belt I bought was flawed by the Amazon match system but Amazon customer support reimbursed me for it with no hassle. I haven't ran this belt much yet, but ill be sure to give an update on its &#34;wear&#34; later in the year. By the way it's made in the USA, not Mexico like most serpentine belts.
B003KPGP6A|5|Nice key chain. The back can be engraved.
B00D9H2YO6|1|Didn't fit my FXDF
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Like
B003INQ8QQ|2|after 2 week of use , now its broken!
B00HS5IBLU|5|Perfect! Thank you!!
B004SRRELY|5|these were delivered on time and a perfect fit. After 50k miles the old ones were pretty dirty. I highly eco men's.
B00GONFTTE|1|I bought two of these they arrived in a timely manner I took the first flight out and went to go hook it up only three out of the six light bulbs worked the second one worked amazing and very pleased with it I guess you get what you pay for
B00DGGL680|5|just as described fast shipping
B000924QO0|5|Love it,, I applied to my new Toyota,, sense the car is new I had little prep,, washed with sponge and water,,<br />Applied by hand with a wax applicator (standard round ?? material),,<br />Comes off a lot easier than wax,, removed then hand buffed,, looks great,,<br />Can't say how it is going to hold up in the weather<br />Plan to put on another coat in a month or so<br />Live in AK,, car is and will be kept outdoors,, will in interesting to see how it holds up this winter<br />Will try to update with pics,, and next spring<br />BTW shipped to Alaska with prime for &#34;free&#34;
B006T3DRTI|5|Admired by a lot people whenever I park or drive around town, fits is perfectly well with my New Rims &#34;18-inch Fits Chevrolet - Corvette C6 Z06 Cup Aftermarket Wheel - PVD Black Chrome 18x8.5 and 19x10 Rear. I got a lot of space in-between and is spokes are wide for clear visibility of the Caliper cover. great product easy to install 2min.
B00VW7CV7U|4|Great product for the price! Wanted to rate 5 stsrs, but one jack will not hold position when extended.
B000VL6AHU|5|very good fit and quality. Good price for the quality.
B00AM1Z67O|5|Yep, it's motor oil.
B002PUTC0M|5|Works great! Great improvement with the stainless steel hose and way better battery placement. Very well built and heavy duty. Very accurate!
B00N2BXSXA|4|Good product for the money. I wish it could fit a little better and was more of a rubber mat than a foam based product. Still happy with it and how it has lasted.
B00IT86XUG|5|Quality sticker...arrived on time. Good price
B00L32KR70|1|Poor fit and bad seal! I had a suspicious squeaky rattle in my new truck that I almost took in for warranty, it is gone now that took the cover off! Do not buy, waste of money. Does look good but noisy and leaks around the front seal!
B00XJ39AJW|3|Works great, but I would recommend the bigger one
B008S9QUGI|5|Exactly as advertised. Simple to install and key to my current ignition key. Smooth operation and lock works like a charm.
B002SSKFGG|5|This was an exact replacement for my old one that sprung a leak.  Seems quieter and better than the original.  I was careful when I took out the old one and left a little wire when I cut them so I could make sure that the new one was connected properly.  The only real difficulty was getting the propane tube through the hole in the new heater.
B008T4YOSS|4|Good and convenient
B0002KKIUK|1|I applied the product as directed and it has not impressed me at all. My fabric top still soaks up rain. It doesn't bead up as promised and would not recommed this product.
B003POHULA|5|Acceptable replacement for the price.
B000E9C21M|3|They look great on the car. Definitely stands out and makes the car look better. Although they don't quite fit the license plates that well. If only they were a little bigger because currently when I wash my car, water gets between the cover and license plate.
B00J8W5Z9C|3|Looks cool, but reception really stinks. I live in a big city and still don't get the radio stations I used to. Also the item isn't smooth black and has grit within. Not impressed and am considering returning.
B0067P6V4G|5|I've always been concerned with the authentic sound slip on mufflers make, but this exhaust exceeded my expectations.  I had a full V&H exhaust on my last bike (Yamaha Warrior) and the sounds was incredibly disappointing before removing the baffles.  I thought this would be the same way, but in fact it sounds great (and plenty loud) with the baffles in.  I also feel this is a better look than the stock exhaust, much lighter, and is incredibly easy to install (about 30 minutes).
B0012GTVVA|5|top notch , easy to install... 1/8 inch bit and a screw driver.....makes door more sturdier.... lot easier to close....
B00JZQXJ3K|3|Ok. So this is a fine product. The hitch itself is well built. All the appropriate parts were included. The instructions were very nice. Glossy color pages. There are some issues with the directions. For one, you do not need to remove the rear tow hook as they say. I have a 2015 JK Unlimited and there was no issues. You do however HAVE to remove the rear bumper.  There is no way around it. Luckily this is easy to do with a basic socket set. Brackets underneath and two bolts on either side. It's not a big deal. When removing the tail light for the wiring harness you only need to undo the screws toward the middle of the jeep. These are the only two that hold the light in. No need to remove the outer two screws. Use a screw driver. Don't over tighten. Be careful not to crack the plastic. I put lock tight on the bolts just to be safe. All in all everything fit fine. It's a great option compared to the mopar version. A lot less $$.
B000OAG2DK|5|Is much better than the other shower head I had and it's adjustable.
B0026I5Z22|5|Great fit on the e60 bmw m5. we put it on the aluminium hood. fit great after about an hour of tweaking it.
B0040CYYRE|1|Does not fit 05 Matric
B0097CXX9W|5|I don't have a car and rely on walking. And public transit. I did extensive research and thes arrived just before the first &#34;polar vortex&#34;. These have already survived two &#34;polar vortex&#34; winters in Chicago! They look like they will last a few more too. I can't say enough great things about this. In the winter, there is nothing that compares to warm, dry feet and clothing!
B007Y4Z0LY|5|Perfect fit for the suburban
B00E1WT64O|5|Fast shipping, great quality! I have this on the front of my car and its fantastic.
B005D6145G|4|Works with my 20w LED to keep it cool with a fan blowing on it.
B00HVHT3OO|5|Perfect fit
B00BVBQ1PK|3|It's just that peace no joint
B00RGQ1OJW|5|The bag is really nice--excellent quality, good-looking, and the high mounted d-rings permit multiple attachment options.<br />Ultimately, I decided it was just a little too small--I couldn't stash my riding jacket in it--so I returned and re-ordered the CL-1060-ST, which is a little larger.
B001U6DMSK|4|Really like these seat covers but hard to put on. And they can snag easy.
B00JOP7D98|5|Worked well.
B00B79XIQ6|5|I love my flirty eye wind sheild cover gives my character.
B00BITHKD2|5|Stoked on this
B001QIUGVI|5|as advertised
B0036U02WM|5|This is an excellent product however it will not work with a J. Strong top, therefore I was unable to use it. Very happy with the quality of the windshield however it would be nice if the description stated it would not work with certain tops.
B001O7PNS2|5|I wax once a year with a machine and carnauba wax, but the boat cover alway leaves a dull finish on the boat. A quick spay and wipe restores a nice shiny finish on the fiberglass and makes it look showroom glossy. I like that you can use it in the sun too.
B00C5AK224|5|Works great, check engine light has not came back on since i put it on.  The amazon app said it would not fit my 2007 F 150 pickup but i tried it anyway and it fit fine. Had to re route cables a little bit but worked fine.
B00Y76UOZE|5|This is the most show-accurate Capsule Corp. decal that I've seen; the logo and font is just right, just like the one on Trunks' jacket. The quality of the decal is very good and it even came with easy-to-follow instrucitons to ensure the best application. I've had trouble applying decals before, but this one was a breeze to apply. I love it; it looks awesome on the back window of my car.
B004QQ721Y|5|Very good!
B001AVS6H2|5|Solid gear
B001GKSQRW|5|This is our third trailer dog.  We used the other two to secure our two ATV's in our trailer.  They worked to keep each ATV secure during transportation.  We now have  enclosed trailer with one UTV.  Works perfect and no need for any tie down straps.
B00MXAXH00|5|Arrived timely just what I needed
B000HCUE2K|5|We had to send back the &#34;first&#34; one because of a leak in a gasket, but the second one works great! Easy to order and communicate with.
B005C1B6LO|1|Sucks!
B000C11JI4|5|The Dorman unit was fairly easy to install after watching U-tube videos.  It works well and was reasonably priced
B00BYGM9FS|5|I was a bit worried at first, since these are only taped on with double sided tape. They hold up great and look fantastic. The 3M tape used is the bombdiggity! I put these on and the very next day, rode 400 miles to a rally and they never budged. The temp at the rally was near a hundred all week and they are still stuck tight! Very impressed with these!
B007Y0CYN0|5|Works great
B007IO9IA4|5|Great sticker, On the back window of my truck, looks good.<br />Jim
B005DHVAKO|5|The showed up 4 days early and fit on my 89 toyota  pickup
B00514ABY0|5|Cools the balls.
B000E0GB1I|5|very fast service, wonderfull. the part works like a dream, very happy!!!!<br /><br />Thank you<br />Dave
B00NX8EYFI|5|soooooo cute
B00651BYGM|1|For starters the inserts they give you for a wrangler TJ are too long.  When I screwed the antenna into the jeep the as far as it would go you can still see a 1/4 inch of the bolt.  I had to cut part of the bolt off.  This gave a flush look to the antenna and jeep.  Next problem, the reception for my radio was terrible.  I was not able to get all the stations I used to with the stock antenna.  After two days of frustration I changed back to the stock antenna.  Not the best look but 100 times better in performance.
B005OV60HW|4|Works well, but as a few others have stated, it doesn't screw down all the way. Probably fixable by attaching a rubber washer so that there's no gap.
B009ET2BXM|5|Got here the day after I ordered it and looks great on my jeep!
B0006IX850|5|works great filling tank and other things....
B000CB3JZU|5|Excellent
B005F2WK56|5|Replacement part solved problem and was easily installed and checked out.
B004I199O0|5|Fit perfect on our 2008 Honda CRV. Way cheaper than buying it at the dealer too.<br />Thanks !
B00JN1XGRG|4|Install looks great but reception is diminished.  But use cell phone with Pandora most of the time so doesn't really matter.  But gone is the long worn out stock antenna.
B00N5DWEMG|4|they work fine
B005KLOY56|5|I've been a fan of K&N products for a long time and these filters are excellent, right down to the welded-on nut.
B000HQ0S54|5|Great Deal
B008S8HI1K|5|As described
B003QVIUV6|5|Great part, my Mazda jumped timing due to this spring being old, this solved the problem!
B0041PNQ7O|1|Smaller than it looks. Picture shows it with extra top bag that cost $31.00 extra.
B002R0YOMG|5|Perfect Match !!!
B00J0S8RJY|1|This is one of the worst things I have purchased from Amazon.  Thin material.  No compartment for gas tanks.  Grill will not fit with even a very small plate attached for mounting on a boat.  I have never written a review before, that is how bad of ripoff this is......
B0091OE6K6|4|These holders are simple to install and do the job well.  I'm concerned about them unlatching during a crash, but that would allow the seat belt to then work as designed so overall very happy.  I'd recommend them
B00H7HSWWM|5|Perfect shade of pink and looks awesome
B000C8PAN2|5|Good product, easy to install & works well. I'd buy this one again.
B0051OSJ58|3|Does not completely cover valve threads. Too short.
B00JZXABO8|5|Work like a charm,  inexpensive way to fix the waterpump
B00GBVHQB8|4|Great fit on all fingers, nice padding. The metal mesh on the fingers was a bit stiff and put a lot of pressure on my pinky finger during longer rides, but softened out after a few weeks.
B0028ZKMM6|4|Get it ull need it
B00WW885DM|5|Work well for an XJ (Cherokee) too.  Measure 15 1/4 inches from inner surface of corner hood latch; this is the location of the highest hole of the 3 hole 10mm stud mount bracket.  Fat end of the strut goes here.<br />  Below, mount the same 3 hole bracket about 3/4 inch from the lip where the ledge connects to the firewall (same little rail the hood prop mount sits on.  You may even have the first hole predrilled from the factory.<br />  Same position, both sides.  Easily clears the wiper fluid fill spout.  Your hood will leap open...  So watch you don't catch it on the chin when you release the center latch.
B008AKN81K|5|Fun addition
B000E28MTU|4|NICE FILTER !
B00XN2XLQ2|1|Is not leakproof! Had half a bottle of water whose cap wasn't on tight enough leak through the bottom!
B001GC2LVM|5|Fantastic... The only caution is that it is hard to safely reach the full 4&#34; lift advertised. 3&#34; is about all I am comfortable achieving, even with a spotter telling me when to stop. That said, 3&#34; is generally enough. If it's not enough in your camping spot, maybe you should pick a different spot!
B00GOO3DAK|5|Perfect fit!
B000IYA3RI|2|does not use a bearing just plastic on a bolt will not work long so I will not install
B00PC7OFK2|5|Excellent pretty fits great!
B0002X520S|5|The ONLY choice!
B002WLFAB4|5|excellant product
B004HMBK5G|4|The only thing i don't like about these is that you can't take them off easily after you put it on, which makes it hard to use in a car with multiple drivers.
B00G9W9J8C|5|IT WORKS... JUST WHAT I WANTED...
B00GXXCP24|5|These are great for applying wax or chrome polish on my bike,hold up well and cheap to buy.
B008CLNYPC|3|cheap , but worked
B00I2HU47W|5|Very nice product! would recommend to anyone.
B004GE3FTO|1|came in without radiator mount bolts, was missing riveted in nutplate for lower hose cover plate. the mounting hole and air flow hole for fan reostat was missing. THE WORST PART WAS IT IS ALL PLASTIC INSTEAD OF FIBERGLASS FLEXED WITH EVERY BOLT I TIGHTENED. NO WHERE IN PRODUCT DESCRIPTION DID IT MENTION THAT IT WAS PLASTIC. IF I HADN'T NEEDED TO GET CAR ON ROAD I WOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK AND GONE TO DEALER OR JUNK YARD FOR A FIBERGLASS ONE. TO BE FAIR I DID NOT CONTACT SELLER SINCE I WAS OUT OF TIME AND HAD TO USE THE PART.
B00SLLELEQ|5|fits and work good
B00G49DUJY|5|Can't go wrong with meguiars. Looks great, and a nice black shine
B00TQQ37OA|5|Absolutely love the vest ordered a 66xl but was to large went with 5xl and fits perfect little tight over my heavy insulated hoodie however this vest is snaps and zipper so vest extenders and it's perfect !!<br /><br />High quality heavy soft leather<br />One piece back for patchs<br />Left and right concealed carry pockets
B004WLHOGG|2|For my bike, a Yamaha FZ-09, these mirrors look great  However, the quality is a little low. One of the mirrors is warped, distorting the reflected image  tge other mirror's hex head tightening screw stripped the aluminum and I had to uses another type of fastener to tighten it to my 1&#34; bar.  Definitely some fitment issues, they will not fit mybstock bars and did not come with other adapters.  I used tape to thicken the circumference of my bars so the mirrors could fit snuggly. At the end of the day, I paid $28 for mirrors and thats what I got.
B00D3290EO|3|Good heavy duty car floor covering mats  but had to do lots of cutting to fit rear but end up covering whole floor. It was the fronts that was the problem, about two- three inch space on each side of mats not covered and outer hump on floor,where it turn upward, causes it not to lay flat to the floor. Knowing this, before, I would not had ordered this product. Not a good fit for the car I ordered it for. Thanks any how for trying.
B002OAV50I|5|perfect fit
B002OUMVWY|5|product is as advertised
B00ELJ9H1Y|5|Very funny, and true!
B0093A8JAG|5|Love it. Fits exactly as I wanted. Good purchase.
B000H0KNSM|4|:)
B00BLPS29E|5|Love these locks!  I bought two initially for use by me and my husband.  Loaned mine to my son and he liked it so much that I ordered one for him as well!
B00XTVQTNY|1|Did not fit..!
B0010Z4MDK|5|Working good and quick delivery
B00N9BKBVK|5|Great.exactly what I ordered
B00C0SQ8KG|4|I like it for the price
B00FB3MT7S|5|Received a day early and I love it! Too cute. It wasn't the exact cursive scripture as the picture... But its still cute. Instead of putting it on my car, I put it on my door mirror & it was easy to peal off. Overall, besides it not being the exact same as the picture shown, I still like it.
B00W2XDXHU|5|It was exactly what I need I appreciate  the good job
B001O2T43M|5|good
B00FQQFCQU|4|Just bought it. PAIN in the ASS to get on...But it turned out nice. When I got the roll it was curved upside down instead of being straight so I had to make cuts to it when I put it on. Other then that looks good! Don't mess up when putting on the letters because once you try to fix them it doesn't look the same after.
B00LSDEGX0|4|These are the perfect size for the motorcycle, laptop, and car  side windows. Nice quality.
B001NOXFEU|1|Worst paint gun I've ever used. Cheaply made, didn't even do one job with it, sprayed a test panel a few times and threw it in the trash
B00QULZ8LE|1|Cap comes without TRD logo. The picture shows the logo but the one that I have received is complete black without any logos.
B000Z0HVHA|5|As advertised.  Works great.
B00412YYVO|5|Can't complain so far. Great price and works perfectly on my 2002 Acura RSX.
B00BLPT7VQ|4|Has lots of issues randomly shutting off, kind of wishing I would have just ponied up the cash for the BMW kit.
B007V2BV0S|4|Fits my 2012 Civic GX great.  There's not a problem with the seam down the middle, they overlap enough to block it out.  It is a bit awkward because the window is so large.  I just throw them on the floor in the back seat.
B003V1JES4|4|great
B001418IT4|4|Good
B006A2WLYA|1|doesn't fit at all way to short in length and doesn't line up!!!
B005A0RUS0|5|it is a perfect fit for my g8.  I think this is OEM.  I cannot tell this is aftermarket. buy this product wit confidence, fits and looks just like the originall
B009PJJVJI|5|Installed it on my mother's 2005 Chrysler Sebring Convertible. The old one made a horrible click when you opened the door. Installation took about 25 minutes with a screwdriver and 10mm socket. Save yourself a lot of time and don't remove the door panel. Simply pop off the speaker grill, remove the 4 screws holding the speaker, unplug it and set it aside. Then make a cut into the vapor barrier and you'll be able to get your hand over to the door check to pull it out once you've taken off the 10mm nuts and bolts. Then just put the new one back in and duct tape the vapor barrier back up, replace the speaker and grill and you're done! You'll save well over $100 dollars by doing it yourself and avoiding a dealer.
B004I0L6AQ|5|Easy to install, solved my problems of intermittent blinker issues.
B009B8UZGG|3|Good quality. I feel it is overpriced. I noticed other complaints about no way to secure it closed, I agree this is a poor design. I have had cheap discount store ' heat shields' that seemed to work as well.
B0049HSNPO|5|Worked perfectly
B00BYX5TGM|5|Great product,  easy to install and looks great as well.
B00VA0SDXU|4|It works as described. However it is too big to fix in my Prius factory pre-cut aux hole so I had to make some modifications to make it fit. Not the easiest switch to install - 5 prongs connection.
B00UEC87QS|4|I had been looking at grill inserts for my Jeep and came across these. I read the customer reviews and got them today, a few days after placing the order.<br />The inserts I received were glossy black and I did have to cut the middle one to accommodate the hood lock. They do go good with my black Rubicon.<br />The inserts just snapped right in, allowing me a chance to fit them first. The adhesive strips are way too thin and narrow but I think they will be okay.<br />The plastic is very brittle and the grill inserts need to be made of a much more sturdier plastic, something akin to the plastic of the fenders.<br />Overall, I think they will do the job well but I will have to check them once and a while to be sure that they are firmly secure. About what I expected for the money.
B009XINTRQ|5|Good set for a good price.
B00COOT6X2|1|Both ballast lasted about a month.<br />I'm back to stock lights because I don't trust any of these products
B004I0M484|5|Perfect fit on my 94 explorer. And received it fast.<br />Brand new
B007R2TSCU|5|Love it works great
B00KRNCNPA|5|works great, great quality
B0050V11UC|3|Decent light not as bright as I would have hoped for
B004WNJYC6|1|Will not fit 2011 Legacy GT.  The induction is below on GT, this is made to fit on top.
B0012S616Q|4|replacing loan out tool
B00AWYBPTE|1|I bought two red ones, and one of them turned orange within a year.
B0118H077E|5|No Complaints here! Excellent for special areas!
B0006309VG|5|Excellent
B00DSVMCSQ|5|Good quality for price point!
B00ZUJ0W2C|1|I bought this item maybe 2 weeks ago, used it once and it broke. It took me forever to get it on the bike and forever getting it off. Now that it's off It no longer works. It will not lock. The key just turns and turns and turns!!! Such a waste of money!!!!!
B00N7C2O6G|5|Product arrived undamaged. Works as expected.
B00H7KYFAM|5|Great prodact. Great company
B00LG07MZE|4|Great coverage for my Santa Fe - was hoping it would be a little thicker, but so far seems to be holding up, just not sure it will last more than 1 season here in New Mexico
B00A2A1RFK|4|great product, the packaging was a little light especially for USPS causing slight damage.  Took the damaged part from old switch and it works great.
B0081KM6N0|5|Superb visibility at night, and during daylight hours, not too bad! People can see them well enough to get out of the way. I was suprised by the quality and brightness
B00HUCG1T0|5|love it
B00ESNXKJS|5|bought it as a gift for my husbands new car. color is a really nice blu not too vibrant just right.
B001GF0KPI|4|Covercraft products have always been great! I especially like the custom fit sunshades, which I have for all of my cars.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the means by which they secure the roll up sunshades now. They used to have a Velcro strap that was used to secure the sunshade while it is rolled up. In the last year or two they have changed to a piece of Velcro that you're supposed to stick on the inside of the sunshade. While it does work, after a short time the heat from the sun makes the adhesive on the Velcro break down, and the Velcro then comes off, preventing you from keeping it rolled up.<br /><br />They should return to the Velcro strap, as it's far more effective and won't fail like the adhesive piece does.
B00Q5E4JE8|4|Arrived on time and the air in my car seems to be cleaner!
B00MS1RHVE|5|nice length good color. Have had it on for about 3 months through some pretty serious summer rain and summer heat, no fading.
B001KS6FPK|5|Fit well on Hyundai Accent 2010
B005HTLZDA|3|Had to adjust one of the tailpipes to fit, they weren't direct bolt ons and go. Overall good quality though and fit over the axle which is tricky on these cars.
B0035MMJF4|5|Works awesome. Has lasted nearly 1 year with trailer plug controller. Easy install and double sided tape that comes with it works great and has lasted all this time
B00UEABTMO|5|great fit thanks
B0091I1SD0|5|this is a great little solar fan
B00FRJGYWW|5|Fit my 2014 scion Tc perfect. All the pieces were there and easy to install in about 10 minutes
B000CO86BY|5|Did a great job keeping the car stable while replacing breaks!
B006T5LQGW|5|Love this bulb. I have a BMW Z3 and they fit perfectly in the interior light and the trunk light. Be sure you check the bulb specs you are replacing for the correct voltage and wattage. Easy to install and you can even tilt the bulb til you get the desired light position. Very handy HIGH:Y recommend.
B002JPA770|5|exactly what we wanted.
B001T5C116|5|I was in a bad motorcycle accident I high sided going 60 mph and these did its job perfectly. I was wearing Kevlar jeans over and my legs didn't have one bruise or scratch. They are comfortable and very breathable. You wont regret it!
B00V5QDJI8|5|CUTE SOFT VINYL ADD ON'S FOR DJI TRANSMITTER STICKS WHICH ARE METAL
B002PLJAB2|1|Beware!!!!!Dont waste your money!! Mine worked once. The Valve on the pump does not shut off letting all the air blow right out.<br />For $200 I thought I was going to get a quality product man was I wrong.
B00PRUR2KO|2|Worked for a couple weeks in my rzr 1000 but then the connections came loose inside on both of these switches. Had to buy new, higher quality switches. Might be ok in non offroad environments.
B000LG64IU|4|Works like factory remote...the only complaint is that the two halves are getting a little loose.  It hasn't come apart so only one star deducted.
B004QP8BNS|5|I bought this tool to remove heavy diesel equipment and my strap wreches were falling short. This tool did the work and and allowed for better control.
B00EXLYRS8|1|I truly wish I could give zero stars!!! This was a true waste of money and a huge disappointment!!! My Harley Davidson Road King  was down for a few months while I customized more things and I bought this gear shift linkage to match my other chrome flamed accessories.  I had the part installed and had only riden my bike about 3 miles when the dang thing snapped into 2 pieces. Needless to say I will never buy anything from this company again!!! I could only imagine what may have happened if I had made it to the freeway and it snapped while I was in traffic. I was out of town and had to go to the local Harley Dealer to buy the exact linkage that I had at home that I replaced with this garbage.
B00JA3BMDW|4|fast shipping great product
B00CPYFOW8|4|Wasn't that easy to put on but fit perfectly and works like a charm.
B012DZXXWG|1|This image is stolen. I know this, because I'm the one who designed it. If you want to buy the real thing, go here http://www.cafepress.com/stargazerdesign.1612002773
B00LGKEFBI|5|I used these to add OEM fog lights to my LM Tucson/ix35. They were all missing a middle &#34;clip&#34; but fit snug.  After six months of driving and off-roading, they are still connected.
B0091OE6II|2|not good material.
B004I0PP4Y|5|Awesome! Great fit!
B00KTIVHLY|3|Easy to program, but you get what you pay for. The range on these is pretty weak. Considering the price I paid, that's understandable. They're good enough to use as a backup set.
B007NNKG5G|5|Ok
B00B3P25SQ|5|Amazing
B000HCRF0Y|5|Fits better than other brands i have tried.
B000EQVYA0|1|Very disappointed.  Would not engage the starter.  Went to the local big box parts store and bought the Car Quest branded switch which worked perfectly.
B001OIRUKK|5|Good fit
B00M0TLQ66|5|This stuff really works as advertised. It's the only rust remover I have found which works without acid, fumes or disposal problems.
B000CMHTZU|5|These fit and look good and do the job!
B002QUJ92C|5|Very good product(s).  They do a very good job of keeping the wind out of my eyes (less tearing up) and having the ability to change between sunglasses and the clear glasses is very convenient!
B0002STSQM|5|item can fast at a good price
B00JBIRBK4|5|Excellent Product and Seller!
B00885TGV8|5|Good product
B00HJEUUKU|5|Work great!
B00VNJ4DKK|2|When installed only received about half of the normal radio stations
B004XJ0EF0|5|My car seat did not come with these and now that I have them, I feel much more secure.
B0016I8IHM|5|OEM Replacement. Identical to one I took off 1998 Cadillac Deville without electronic leveling except there is no backup to tighten the nut. I carefully used vice grips at very top of piston to get to required torque. You will need a good spring compressor to disassemble/assemble. Make sure you put the right strut back together with the right spring/bearing assembly. It make a difference, if you want to put the right spring/bearing back on the right side.
B001PYNWOQ|4|Good purchase
B000GVBUY8|5|As advertized
B0006JLU1I|5|Fit perfect on our 2003 Ragen Toyhauler.  Looks and works great!
B00G4Q6U4O|5|It works
B0023W1L0Q|2|I'm getting condensation in the headlight.  Unfortunately I through the original Honda part out and do not have the time or patience to replace it.
B0009Y2CFS|5|Husband bought me this as a gift.  I ride a ferry in the winter to commute to work and sit in my car.  This was a very thoughtful and useful gift!  I love it!  It doesn't get too hot, but it keeps me warm.
B00MU5X17M|5|Worked Great!!!
B00PEY60V0|5|Useful for my mom who as arthritis.
B00WYJX77I|5|Great!
B007Y03YY8|5|I don't need to return it I got it to work and it works great thank you for your help
B00UO6GOYQ|5|Great product works good
B004QQC70A|1|Returned. Wrong color.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Bought these to drive a small ride on mower into and out of a shed  They work fine and fold up when not used and don't take up much room in shed
B00846HT38|5|Antenna arrived ahead of schedule and installed in one minute.  Works and looks great!
B00C8E9CTQ|4|Product came as pictured.  Installation was not that bad, but a little harder then the UTube video makes it out.  Removal of the gauge cluster was helpful.
B0006IX87S|5|product is as advertised
B00681BE2S|5|works great.  had to replace batteries after many months, easy to program, still working great!
B002YCFZ84|4|Fits my 1998 Ford F-150 4.6L V8. I replaced the original tube along with the valve. Rust had appeared and I was chasing down what was causing the pesky P0171 error code. The original was difficult to come off of the exhaust manifold at first.
B000CQOIVO|4|Fair Price,, &#34;Free Shipping&#34; with Prime to &#34;Alaska&#34;<br />Initially estimated date of delivery 2-3 weeks,, arrived in less than one week<br />Installed on small ATV trailer<br />for 29.00 no complaints!!!
B002UCYRZU|3|Arrived well packaged, and as described. However, the product itself did not live up to our expectations. Did not really work to clean the lexan.
B000BZJ9Q0|4|It solved my problem.
B004W5SGBO|3|Better to just get a box sized correctly for your battery instead of an adjustable box.
B002GO92UC|4|Required some grinding on vehicle frame to fit.
B009DJ1PD0|4|Works fine, not so sure on the performance gains.  Bought it mainly because it wasn't that much more than OE and is reusable with clean/oil treatment.
B000IYCSOY|5|Great quality and a reasonable price. Fixed the problem on my jeep grand Cherokee.
B000CHS2YM|5|Excellent
B00L2LM59U|1|The undercoatings and paints by POR15 are great but the bed liner is horrible it flakes off and peels back up no matter how many coats you put on it! But the undercoating is still there and does not chip flake or peel. I even tried sanding the surface of the undercoating prior to puting the Bed liner on like POR15 says to but didn't work. I would not recommend this product. I went to napa bought 4 aerosol cans of bed liner sprayed it on and haven't had any problems even with loading pallets with a fork truck. So I would say go to napa its $7 per can and took 4 cans for 2 coats.
B004ZF4MW8|5|I purchased these units after purchasing a set of Xentec, blew out the xentec set in 3 days even with a relay harness. my seller refused refund and so i came here and bought these..  they are really nice unit, the ballasts are quite solid and have a secondary step up transformer in the bulb wire. they were very easy to install the product was nice but i think they can do without the case they come in, it adds extra cost to an otherwise very affordable product.
B0097CIO5U|5|Very good product. I love the looks of these. It helps break up the inner fairing look.
B0015HMXOI|5|Good idea as a back-up to replacing the ignition switch and chip resister key. I was not sure I could get away with simply adding this GM Power train Control Module bypass resister. If the contact points inside the ignition switch and on the key get extremely worn as mine were, the key slot it's  self is likely to fall apart soon too. I replaced the ignition switch and used a DPDP toggle switch to allow me to start my 1996 Buick with a resister chip key or switch to a no-chip key via a hidden toggle switch.
B00XV8U2QU|5|Amazing product.
B00WINPNXQ|4|Good part
B00EC0ZD56|5|Good, make you you have a GOD DAMN HAIR DRYER to install it.
B00CLKVN1C|5|My boyfriend loves this! I got it for him as a gift and its very nice and comfortable. Plus its padded but you cannot tell when it is on.
B000778LCU|5|Great price
B00JCE5XN4|5|Love it
B006JRLIVS|5|Exact Fit, Easy Installation Love it!
B005GL86Z4|4|Product arrived on time. Product was as described, however it did not fit my BMW Z3 properly. The good thing about the product is it has a drawstring so you can tighten it to fit smaller vehicles
B00T36J7ZQ|5|I really think this will help with my dual wheels in the back of my motorhome.  I'm glad I purchased them and can't wait to try them out!
B0042XI3D2|5|Awesome! Be aware of the &#34;low profile&#34; design of these fuses. It worked fine in my car, but have found that not all cars are so accepting of these fuses (chevy sonic).
B00HTRGYXE|5|Very nice
B002N5DE2G|5|If you have an RV you need some 15 and 30 amp fuses.
B00KTFLX98|5|Came quick, fit like a champ.
B00L847P3C|5|The lights fit great
B001PNE8O0|5|Works for my 96 ranger
B001UR5XCW|5|Very accurate! this alleviated a lot of pain of shuffling articles of clothing at the airport to get under that magic weight limit and avoid additional fees. Must have for travelers.
B0050NGB32|5|Good fit, i did go ahead and drill a 3/8&#34; drain hole in the bottem
B002RVJX1C|1|Gauge stinks leaked the first time I used it!!!! On the other hand Amazon is awesome!!! Return was super quick and easy as always......thanks!!!!!
B004XEQMLU|1|The manufacturing company sewed it backwards. Guess u get what you pay for.
B00JEUI40U|5|Excelent
B004VR0H1A|3|Very satisfied.
B000VKTUJQ|5|Just as good as Toyota OEM filters. I previously purchased a carbon charcoal filter hoping it would filter out smelly diesel exhaust, but it didn't. So I decided to just stick with TYC non-carbon filters. It's good quality at a good price.
B007TBWQMS|4|Husband loved it
B00RV756ZO|5|I am pleased and would like to do business  with u all again
B00498AEQE|5|good
B00PXMAT92|2|Although advertised to fit my car, it did not.  However, on the positive side, my refund was handled in a 4-Star manner.
B00NB7OPLO|5|This headlight installed easily and was a perfect match to what I had.  The cost was reasonable and it arrived in a timely manner.  I couldn't ask for more.
B004XACFK6|5|Very visible at night and actually not too bad during the day either. I was suprised at the quality. They have a lot of different modes too which I liked
B0080J3QYA|4|Have several shop vac models.  This one works as advertised.  Wish it came with the 1 1/2 hose instead of the 1 1/4.  Would buy again.
B000S2U8Q6|5|Good fit, Great parts!
B00EB30YHQ|5|Perfect glove-like fit for the large and unusually shaped windshield on our 2015 Ford Escape.  The inside and outside are clearly identified.  It is necessary to fold over the areas near the mirror to get the shade in front of the mirror, and I hope this won't create a weak line at the fold.  No problem with that so far (purchased July 2015). The item arrived timely and appropriately packaged.  No complaints.
B00GSAUHB8|1|Had it about a month and it's already broken.  :(
B0041MTABS|5|they fit snug and works fine
B00W35UY6K|5|When shopping on Amazon, I saw this product and placed an order immediately. It was amazingly delivered fast. I fitted it in only a few minutes and I am happy with the performance. Highly recommended!
B00HB68OD6|5|2011 F-150 2WD Eco Boost, heavy duty payload and heavy duty tow package -- 8 foot bed -- installed with my daughter's help in about 30 minutes -- I do have a compressor and air tools so maybe 10-15 minutes faster than with hand tools. Instructions OK -- pretty intuitive otherwise. Much easier than other reviews stated. I did not cut the plastic panel they said you need to trim -- I just pushed the lip of it up over the opening of the hitch. It has not come back down and was easy to do. It is good for putting a rack on so as to hold a cooler or a bicycle rack. I use mine to put my boat into a tight parking place in my level backyard -- virtually impossible to do from the back but pretty easy hooked up front.
B00MC6RQAM|1|i washed and waxed and vacummed the car. Changed the oiI and packed everything up. Last thing was to replace the reverse lights which i ordered the day before. I plugged these in and &#34;pop!!!&#34;. My break lights are out. My running lights are out. Check my fuses and all are fine. Car wont shift out of park. Vacation cancelled. 500$ non-refundable. Thanks for a terrible product.
B002D4QWX0|2|Not so great
B0024E6W02|5|Awesome sewer hose. If the hook up is close you can only use one hose. Comes with caps foe both hoses. Doesn't fit in my bumper but still a good product
B004GWZ0BC|5|Sipped on timely manner.  Exact part I needed. No complaints
B003CR2ILM|5|Sounds great on my 2013 Ram 1500.
B00BFE31ZQ|5|This item do works. Highly recommended! Great price on amazon !
B00EHK0O2I|5|Item works great. Purchased to block the sun from my infants head. The only issue I have seen is that the item does not fit perfectly flat in the corners letting some sun through the small cracks. This will likey change over time as the product wears in.
B008I2MLWM|5|Fits perfect
B0077HE8PM|5|Worked great. Only problem is that the shaft rust greatly.
B00M8OECTG|5|A+
B00MWCLYRM|5|Quality stucker, thanks!
B004I10SKE|5|Perfect fit for a fraction of what I would have paid at the dealer.  Took 5 minutes to change out, switch bulbs over and I was good to go.
B007HRWNBS|1|I bought and installed this to replace original. Furnace wouldn't work, so took to rv dealer. Turns out thermostat was defective.
B00LH1N8J6|1|Flicker issue, error code
B001IH8Q0A|5|Priced right! Beat all the retail outlets.
B00P2D41OQ|5|I installed these in my 2003 Toyota Tacoma and they worked great!!  Nothing like having a NAME Brand light!!  I tried some the Chinese LED lights and they did not compare and did not last!  These light are brighter than stock and very well defined cutoff (this is do to the design of my reverse light housing)  and throw to the side is much better than stock incandescent...  I have these installed for 4 months now and have had no problems.  I glad to see the major name brand light manufacturers finally getting into the LED market and bring some reliability to this segment of the market.
B00SXE4CCW|5|fits great. first one did not fit. company sent correct cover right away. happy with cover, easy enough for me to get on and off.
B000M5Y72A|3|Should probably be 2 stars as I can see no difference in my old ones and if you happen to have Ford &#34;Panther&#34; body, what a PITA changing and aiming them
B002Z2Z7ZY|1|Ultra high quality charger! This unit has no trouble supplying all the current needed to program BMW's and other vehicles. VERY stable voltage when using programming mode. Charging modes seem to work as expected! It is lighter than I anticipated and easily portable. The cables are high flex type which makes it easier to gather them up after a job. Also, the cables are long enough to easily reach any vehicles battery terminals while the charger is on the ground.  UPDATE March 11th 2016 - A few days ago i powered this charger up and the lights seemed to be acting funny.... NO output. Its dead. Called Schumacher and paid $60 to send it back. I anticipate they will send me a repaired unit, but I'm unable to complete the job i was working on for two weeks at best. Don't know if i will trust it for programming after this.
B00SMRV4EO|5|Works perfectly in a 2007 tundra limited crew cab. I love how bright it is now.
B00JFCAKZE|5|perfect match!
B007859A4W|5|fits the 2015 R1200RT with no problems.  Took about 4 minutes to key the lock for my bike.  If youa re in the market and dont want to pony up the 1600 for the other backrest box then this one will work great.
B00C8UKFIM|5|Perfect and easy way for perfect tire balance.
B00CQAR1C2|5|Only been on one outing since installing this, but good so far. The installation instructions were a bit lacking but there are plenty of videos on YouTube and I recommend watching several before trying this task. So far I am very pleased.
B0046I3I8I|5|Didn't fit my 3 horse trailer tires. But fits great on my cargo trailer.
B00G9W9J8C|4|Just got it today. It seems to fix the Classic OK. There are no holes for the antenna's but a person can put them there. It will just be used to cover the bike in the garage.
B002OW5J44|5|nice unit,fit good.
B0006BIDWK|4|Great tool
B004Y18GKM|5|It works good like it's supposed to, and cheaper than the one from HARLEY DAVIDSON.
B00029WYEY|5|These filters are very well made and look very sporty great increased air flow plus after very easy to clean & oil keeps it<br />Looking new this is my choice filter give it try you will be pleased
B000CO7H7I|5|I couldn't find these locally and was glad to see I could get them on Amazon and for a decent price. I could find the other style of quick split connectors, but I preferred this style as it would be easy to disconnect and troubleshoot if the need should arise.<br /><br />I tapped into 16 gauge wire with no problem. It didn't cut all the way through the wire, just cut away some wire cover to make a connection. The male connector requires a bit of force to connect and disconnect, but I hope to not have to do that too often.<br /><br />I used one of these for the install of a backup camera that needed to tap into the reverse power wire.
B003FO2O1G|5|The Jack King replacement head for my camper antenna works great and was very easy to install.
B000GZV89G|4|Great
B00523AMBC|5|as described.  will have to update when i use it.
B00HJ6O4A0|4|Compact, easy to carry, large enough for two people.  Wipe down to clean.
B002QOYS42|5|Works great on the handlebars of my Harley. Mounting is a little tricky, but if you take your time, it's a good solid fit. Solid as a rock.
B00JPJYCII|5|As posted great package
B00DD0ZJN2|5|The wheel cover has a strong aroma that has not died down for the last week or so. The inside rubber lining is slightly textured, so if you're concerned about any embossing being left on your leather, this may be a slight concern. The seatbelt covers are nice and plush and do not carry the odor from the wheel cover. The item picture is a bit misleading; the color scheme of all the items is silver and black, with some patches of white. Overall a fun way to spice up any car.
B002EOVDII|4|This charger was not as well made as one of the apple brands I have bought in the past. The cord started coming apart at the junction on the part you plug into the car slot after about 2 months.
B000OAW2R0|5|Doing exactly what it was designed for.
B000WG4X28|5|I got these for my wife's Cannondale lefty fork. Worked great when I finally followed the instructions. I broke several of them before reading the instructions.
B00L2KJDZ0|5|Very good
B008KV4GCO|5|Great replacement pump for our Polaris jet ski!
B00PJ3ACOW|5|This decal is high quality and very easy to apply. You just clean the area you want to place it (I used rubbing alcohol to make sure it was clean and dry) and then you stick it. When you peel the backing off you may need to 'support' a few letters, but it'll stick cleanly and look great!
B00DB8PXA0|4|My husband had to drill another hole to fit this on his 99 Toyota Tacoma truck but it went on finally and it looks a lot better! So we are happy!☺
B00IYTX6VO|5|Beautiful and good quality
B0009XXMVW|1|Wrong belt for my truck. Thus belt is for vehicle without airco. It may be a good product but I would not know.
B00KTIVEP8|1|Remote only lasted 8 months. Replaced battery still only works 1 ft. From car.
B0013FWACW|4|It solved my problem.
B000CPJMC0|5|Nice
B003E2WQE4|3|It works but I was expecting something a little more stout.
B002OR41UM|5|Easy install and I saw the different charge modes go in to effect over some time and use.
B000C11JMU|5|Item arrived right on time and fits just right.  Works great.
B00C1YI2XA|3|These are way brighter  than my others.
B0062DKMJ8|5|Easy to install and I don't worry that someone will take off with it.
B000FOL0AA|4|Works as intended. Only draw back would be the short screws they provided. I would recommend going to the local hardware store and getting longer screws.
B000EDUUJ4|5|Cheap and functional. Just what I was looking for.  What more do you want. You could spend 3 times as much and not get anything that really works much better.  I use it to hang my ladder on my motorhome ladder.
B001OCXI2U|5|This is what I needed. The right size to get the job done right.
B00498ZRTI|5|just as described fast shipping
B00EFGP6QI|4|Cheap upgrade but makes a difference
B000KYV18G|1|Did not work and had to be programmed by an Auto dealership!!!
B00838335A|1|Not worth the upgrade.
B0002NIF70|5|Really good looking tag, best part... MADE IN USA!!!!
B0024E6ZW2|5|Just buy this thing.  What a game changer for wobbly old rv steps
B0068NQGKG|5|Arrived on time and fits perfectly. Price was better than anywhere else I searched.
B0052FRY1Q|5|The handles came in an time an were just what was needed. They were easy to install and worked just exspeced.
B001T6JFI2|3|this is the ARP 1/2&#34; head bolt kit and thats not clear in the product description.<br />Some 258cid engines use 7/16&#34; bolts, so check yours first before ordering.
B004GCUTKO|1|Initially we were pleased.  It fit, not extremely hard to install, etc.  However the light &#34;cover&#34; has already come off - unsealed, unglued or however it is attached to the light casing.  Will have to figure out an effective way to reattach it.  Disappointed.
B00SH1SN6C|1|Worked well ONCE on a 4.0L. Fried itself on second use, same vehicle. Terrifying.
B004O5IDHE|3|Package arrived damaged, both end of the box torn completely off and then taped back over the opening.<br />It does require some assembly, 8 bolts and the 8 bike hangars. Takes about 20 minutes with deep socket wrenches. Just don't expect to open the box and attach it to your car or truck and go (sadly as I hoped from a YouTube video I saw on this, we were packing to drive out of town on the day it arrived).<br />It's bigger, heavier and more cumbersome than it looks in the pics/vids, but I will say the &#34;hang by tire&#34; method works best across a wide range of frame shapes. A key feature is the option to remove a rack to carry only two bikes. That helps with the size issues.<br />It's a bit hair raising to get that first bike between the rack and the vehicle without scratching anything, and you'll have to fiddle with the height of the hangars to keep the bikes from banging against the hangars. There's a foam sleeve on the tube, but the square hangars stick out well past that foam bumper.<br />This is the style we needed, and I chose this brand to save $100+, so we'll keep it and I'll remind myself I saved $100 every time I have to wrestle with it. Not sure the more expensive ones wouldn't have had these issues too.
B00LE61UBC|1|Runs VERY small!  I ordered this 4 sizes larger than normal, and it was still too small.  I could not fit my arms in the sleeves.  Great idea, extremely poor execution.
B0012PQYQ6|5|great buy.<br /><br />thank you.
B000OQCHLU|5|A perfect transaction...the best product for the application, quick delivery and an un-beatable price. I'll buy again, for sure.
B00469J9J4|5|Great
B001PLBWX2|1|I DID NOT LIKE IT.... PLEASE DO NOT GET IT ....YOU WILL BE SENDING IT BACK....DONT GET IT....
B0085FOWVK|5|Just installed this, the Spec-D 4-2-1 header, an SRI, and the bolt on magna flow cat on my 98' accord and it sounds great! Overall, its a little loud on acceleration, but has a very nice cruise tone, and I personally like being heard off the start. The parts all bolted right on, and sit much closer to the bottom of my car than my old rusty exhaust. Also, the power increase with the full I/H/E combo is significant, the car definitely has much less lag getting the RPM's up for a pass and just seems peppier in general, plus these exhausts are an amazing price right now, totally worth the money!
B00196LCO2|4|It works
B00BZODG9W|5|Thank you!
B00BCRMC3I|5|These car seat covers are excellent for the price. They are form fitting unlike most cheaper seat covers, you do have to be careful when pulling on the secure ties so that you don't rip them off, Once they are in place the are fine. They are easy to install. These are a wonderful way to give your car a cool new look and protect your seats with very little cost.
B009FU6A5U|5|Huge ride improvement for my Jeep over the Procomp shocks.
B00UW1A0PM|5|Kit came and it gave my truck the lift up front that it promised.  Installation was pretty straight forward, but do yourself a favor and get a pitman puller instead of knocking the crap out of your ball joint to get it separated.  Its quick and easy and they're only about 15 bucks at autozone.  Oh and have an angle grinder handy, you might need to cut off some of the mounting bolt/tread on your struts like I did.  If you're a first timer don't let that scare you it's easy and doesnt mess up the struts.
B00J54EH88|3|it was ok but not enough clear coat...
B003G0Q5MI|5|The liner is a perfect fit and is working great so far. The mat will protect the backside carpet from spills and makes clean up a breeze after<br />a day at the beach.
B00BXOPHAA|5|Awesome company to work with - great product at an amazing price.  My car looks new again - Thanks a Ton!
B000YLWM56|5|Great. Folded out flat on receipt.
B00JN1TEJ0|5|Perfect fit and looks just like the original.  The polyurethane smelled slightly like diesel fuel for a few weeks, but I that is common and harmless with many polyurethanes.  I could not smell it in the car but my hands smelled after driving the car.
B00I6H7LW4|5|Thanks
B0009V4GKU|5|looks great on my man's Denali
B00IQWP42I|4|These stickers are well made.  They don't skimp on the vinyl and the thickness makes them easier to mount correctly than cheap, thin stickers.  One of the reasons I chose these stickers is that they are reflective.  Anything you can do to make your vehicle more visible at night is a plus.  The only thing I don't like about them is the manufacturer's logo on the bottom stripe of the flag.  That was clearly shown in the ad and I bought them anyway.  It certainly wasn't a deal breaker.
B002PQW5B4|5|They are just what we wanted and arrived on time.
B001664JOU|5|Absolutely perfect mattress for an RV. It is firm, not too large and very comfortable. Thinking I will order another as a spare. Fits exactly to the measurement of my camper. Love it.
B00Y1LB95E|1|This product was for a 2015 chevy silverado and said no drilling required.  The back flares has clips that attaches to the lip of the fender. The front however require 5 self tapping screws per side.  Now unless making a new screw hole where one wasn't isn't considered drilling I don't know what is.  The only difference is you use a drill with one and a screw driver with the other.  This could cause a issue with the warranty on a brand new truck.  It's a damn shame too, cause they would have looked awesome!
B00A9ILCSM|2|Perfect color match but not for use on area larger than pencil eraser
B00YB5GAEA|5|For what it sets out to be, a pretty affordable quality taillight, it accomplishes pretty well. It actually has a documented lumen output tge compared favorably with what they where selling at my local x-mart. At full brightness it's 20x more powerful then what they were selling, a tiny non recharable 2 lumen light. What blows me away is the asking prices, despite this light being exponentially more powerful, it only cost me really several dollars more with the shipping costs, around $18 vs $13. It's also recharable, so I don't have to pay for replacement batteries. It's also a pretty intense point source visible at night from over 500ft. Finally, it's also waterproof like my headlight unlike the x-mart tail light.
B00N2HQXDG|5|Works perfectly as advertised.
B0071N6ZFI|5|Well made product to protect the valuables and car from damaging sunlight. Looks great and does not obstruct rear vision.
B00R248W1G|5|The quality is outstanding.
B001CEG90I|5|Once I found this filter, and videos on youtube, it only took me about 5 minutes to install. Dealer wanted to charge me $60 for &#34;Air Cabin Filter&#34; service, so I saved about $45.
B0016IJ0XS|5|Well, it's exactly what it says it is. Came in quickly, fit perfectly, and fixed the problem. Not much more I can say.
B007CEJ8B4|5|Worked great
B000SIBQ84|1|If you need 10mm bolts, DO NOT BUY THESE BOLTS!<br /><br />They are boxed as 10mm, but are in fact 8mm bolts. Calipers are hard to argue with
B004BTJ58Y|5|Perfect fit
B00XF6R464|1|Absolutely horrible build, quality and fitment. Returning bc does not fit 2013 or 14 wrangler.
B001I7ENN4|5|Fit just fine
B00WZWWTIM|5|Easily install and gets rid of that hideous standard fender!
B00PI8MBII|5|I bought this for a 2015 Honda Grom with a Yoshimura RS-9 exhaust and a Vagabond Fender Eliminator. The bolt and spacer are the perfect length to fit these together.<br /><br />If you have a Vagabond FE and want to install a Yoshimura aftermarket muffler, you will need a longer bolt and longer spacer than what Yoshimura provides.
B000SL4A84|5|This is a great kit for the very affordable price. I got one for each vehicle.
B00W4XNQ16|5|These keychains our great quality and they are very sturdy. I love that they have two separate rings within the keychain so I am able to put house keys on one side and car keys on the other if I ever have to remove one set or the other it's much easier than if they were all on one ring. The braided leather is very strong and will last for a very long time. I also love the fact that there are two in the package, my husband and I each use one. Also the braided loop makes it easy to find them in your purse.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.
B001EWG4VC|5|Does the job, No more cutting of the belt on your neck on the hot days. Comfortable and fits well. Seems well made and I will update in 6 months on how they hold up.
B00ATC9LG8|1|Easy install and looked good. Drove around and driver side one installed had a cut in the boot and leaked grease everywhere. Replaced it with old CV shaft and now the passenger side is clicking really bad. horrible quality
B009W7KU3O|4|as described, quick shipment
B003021HHK|4|Just a heads up for someone considering ordering these - my husband has a 2005 GMC Sierra base model that Amazon showed these were compatible for - and they were not. Before ordering I suggest removing one of your tail lights to confirm if it is a 3 or 4 socket light. My husbands truck is a 3 socket, and this part number (ALT-YD-CS03-LED-RS) is a 4 socket. We are actually having to return this item, and per Spyder order their part number ALT-YD-CS99-LED-RS.
B00180HX7Y|5|Fixed the clunk and perfect fit 2002 Lincoln LS. V6 w/sport package.
B0002Q7C3A|5|Satisfied!
B00867HTYY|5|Very funny but true
B0081ST4V4|5|It was definitely worth it. It accomplished what I needed and more
B009RC2HVC|5|Very easy to install loved the service Thanks
B000SL4AA2|5|It did the job very well, I have a pickup truck and the cord was long enough to reach the back tires,<br />it's what I was looking for,<br />Jack
B000EE27NK|3|Found out after I installed it three leds were out. Otherwise good product.
B000M5X0MS|3|So-so, a turkey baster would probably be just as good. The one thing I like is the thin tube which makes it easier to use in tight quarters.
B000LF86IC|5|solid cable
B00BLI06JK|4|works great shipping just took to long
B00469HOOG|1|Nothing special.......it's a 40 dollar 6 gallon bucket on wheels. Mine arrived broken and was given a 40% discount (handle was broken). I bought a couple of grit guards for 5 gallon bucket so I can do the 2 bucket method. This is one bucket no divider. I will use this as a wheel bucket.
B008ESIAXO|5|Good
B006SNU3JG|5|Beautiful Rose, great quality and color, easy to apply
B005XEFADU|5|Have not used it yet, but it was recommended to us said it was the best they ever used.
B00JTEBVE2|5|These were a perfect replacement for my broken visor ratchets.  They installed easily and work better than the original ones.  The ratchets hold their positions better than the originals.
B00IO9CNY0|5|Great set of rotors and brakes at a great price. Smooth breaking!
B0002JMF98|4|Worked great.
B0085H6J9G|5|Works as original equipment. No problems.
B000BQW5LK|5|Pump works perfectly, Here's a YouTube Video on changing differential flude and usage of this pump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRToCHIs_T8
B00LXHHYBW|5|I did a lot of looking before I found these seat covers and I am so glad I did! I bought them to protect my car from my 16 month old. I have a 2011 Hyundai sonata and they fit perfectly! The installation took a little more time than I expected but I also installed everything alone. I love that they give my car the look of leather now and it makes cleaning up after my son a breeze. I did use a lot of zip ties to keep everything in place correctly. And the only thing I couldn't figure out was how to get the bottom part of my backseat to come out so I ended up connecting the strap to the back of the back rest on the car and tucked the rest into the lower portion of the seat. For me that works perfectly fine because no one ever really sits in the back to allow it to loosen.
B00LNQBQLW|4|These are definitely bright.  But the problem is that these LED's don't have the throw that other or standard lights have.  Meaning they don't shine as far down the road as normal ones do.  The light seems do dissipate to quickly.  I have a lot of LED flashlights and they shine a long ways.  They need to figure a way to combine that technology together.  Other than that these are what they say they are and work as described.
B000CI8XT0|2|Junk,  i swapped this clutch in with the luk flywheel in my 1997 tacoma and it lasted only 40k. I went easy on it for a while once it was changed and it gradually got worse.  Lower gears it seems fine, higher gears above 3k it will start slipping.  The clutch was much easier to push which worried me from the start.  The aisin in that truck lasted 180k.
B00SXL9E6Y|2|The helmet is too bulky. Helmet came quickly and looks like the picture. Just don't like the way it fits on my head.
B000P7O5DG|5|Works as described. Very useful..
B002JBDH26|5|The handle arrived quickly (2 days) even though it wasn't eligible to be shipped Prime. Thought it would be the usual mostly plastic handle but it was good quality metal throughout. Even though I viewed videos on youtube on how to install it, I didn't want to spend a few hours installing it so I took the $13 handle to Kauffman Tire. They installed it for $109 total which is still a big savings from the $362 the dealership wanted to charge me. I worked out at the gym (next door to Kauffman's) while the technicians did their magic. I tried the handle several times and it feels solid and well built. I expect it to last a long time. I highly recommend this handle which is much better than the original that came with the Sequoia.
B00N4OZPWC|5|superb !
B00G0P0GHQ|5|Worked as described
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Good
B006VQZWE6|5|I have gone the cheap route for the last 2/3 sets of mirrors.  I spent a couple extra dollars on these and difference is night and day. BUY THESE!!!  Install was a little tricky at first (no instructions).  But once you get them figured out there sure are nice.  My bike (Buell aka Harley motor) has a very bumpy idle and would vibrate every other mirror loose.  Not these, they stay where I put them and can still be adjusted when I need to.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Buy these mirrors!
B001GN33FO|5|heavier made than I thought.great price came in the raw so I didnt have to do much to it just weld and paint.
B000NW8ES0|5|If you got tools and time do it yourself! I don't make $500 a day so I did it myself on a Saturday. Easy shiz peeps. Just look up the procedure and follow it  thoroughly. Piece o cake! Save yourself lots of money! Just don't drop anything down the intake, lulz...
B003ENE6LO|1|only receive screws and nut but not the actu piece.
B005EY2X16|5|Fit the Equinox perfectly. Easy to install in seconds
B00BG1HG5Y|5|Love this thing!!
B00FB7XLTE|5|Looks amazing with transparent blue over it.  Or candy grape...Try it!
B00E9G1MVC|5|works great
B00UW4DJF2|4|great product
B00NXRXXKG|5|these are great
B008E0TBQC|5|Excellent product and seller!
B000JFJLP6|5|I never have written a review because most everything I have purchased has performed satisfactorily and I don't think it is necessary to compliment something that performs as expected. This portable battery booster is the exception. We live on a farm and  I have boosted everything from 200HP Diesel tractors to 25HP gas powered hay wrapper. to standard automobiles. This product works exceptionally well. I have had two similar products from Canadian Tire and neither worked well. If you are looking for a portable booster ,this is the best one I have ever seen
B0010E3JVC|5|Easy to install
B00KNNOIDE|1|Despite photo showing a base frame for this item there is none included so it is useless
B00607NC70|1|It is not very gold it looks pretty brown to me :( not what I wanted.
B00KZZXENU|3|Difficult to pull paper away from vinel and left squeegee marks
B00M9XTMLE|4|The sticker to apply these is not on the product you have to peel and but on.
B00AV1G962|5|Happy with my purchase
B00062YK4O|5|Everything ok, service and product
B00I5UN3W4|2|the back seats dont fit in a vw beetle. the front seats barely. its ok i guess.
B00UQ0WXIQ|5|Great price and work well
B00KULF6CQ|5|great price
B00GMRYKFG|2|Unlike most other aftermarket Cat's, it's as big as the VW OEM (that's very good), but it didn't fit.  It interfered with the side of the engine block and I was faced with an emergency decision: return it and be without my car for a couple of days or cut, bend, weld to give another 1/4&#34; clearance.  I chose to cut and weld but now I have exhaust hanger/rattle issues.  I must take the blame for modifying the fit, but this is the second time I've been burned by an aftermarket Cat. (the first was horribly undersized and failed smog after 2 years).  The lesson for me is to spend the extra money and buy an OEM Cat.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|This sunshade is great.  Covers the whole windshield of my 2013 Thor motorhome.  I should have bought this last year.  Might be a little tricky to fold up, but they give instructions on the web site.  Would definitely recommend this for everyone!!!
B001P29X4G|5|Very ez install. Great upgrade to my jeep cherokee xj.
B0024NSRSI|5|looks good. used the bulbs that it came with it, seem to be ok, maybe i'll change it with the stock one and see the difference. update later.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Makes it easy to hook up the H-D without removing the seat !
B004BSNNY2|5|I love the hose with the gauge since it'll save some money to check for my A/C. Instruction is on the hose and the bottle so you don't have the remember much. It's easy to follow and easy to apply for small re-charge.
B004GC70TM|5|great price
B006EHLHWS|5|Product is as described and arrived quickly.  What more can you ask for?
B00BC3SU4M|1|My battery ran out and I tried using this peak jump starter. It simply DOES NOT WORK.
B004RVSQX6|4|Love
B00NE33M78|1|My second pair of bulbs from this company one bulb keeps blowing out
B00FDHY0RO|1|Don't work ... very poor radio reception.
B0039Z3SPW|5|Perfect transaction.  Product works very well for increasing bass response, and eliminating rattles/resonances.
B0031HEIDY|4|Works just fine
B00CXUCVGG|5|Perfect fit, excellent product!
B00469HO0U|5|New black velcro backing is VERY sturdy, as much as my reference CCS pads. So it seems that previous complaints regarding the backing that came apart, Griot's has successfully addressed the situation.
B00075XCCG|5|Perfect fit for a 2008 Honda Pilot EXL. The bolt holes line up perfect. The installation video ( by etrailer ) was well done. I did have to remove the spare tire because it was in the way of tightening the 2 bumper bolts, but I did Not lower the muffler as described. I had no problem installing the hitch with the muffler in place.
B0000AXU02|5|Thanks
B000C9OI1G|5|Good quality product at a decent price. Fit my Grand Prix perfectly.
B0009IK5NU|5|came in g condition but didn't fit
B00496Y4IK|5|Genuine AC Delco part at half what the dealer wanted, what's not to like.
B000EFCPOK|5|Mine came yesterday and it is huge... approx 21&#34;  X 33.5&#34;. Since 5 square feet is 720 square inches and mine is somewhere between 695 and 715 square inches, I think that it was properly described for size. This is the largest chamois I have ever purchased and may consider cutting it in half to have two. It is nicely rectangular, and I followed the instructions before (and after) using. The instructions asked me to wash the chamois in warm water and mild soap before the first use and after using. The water turned yellowish during hand washing because (I think) the excess cod oil from the tanning process was coming out. I used it to dry my car and it did a wonderful job. No lint, no streaks, no problems...just a dry, shiny car. I usually read Amazon reviews before buying a product to gauge if I should buy. I almost did not buy this because of the negative reviews. Yes...I'm also extra skeptical of products made in China. For most of the negative reviews for this product and a pressure cooker I just bought, I'm wondering if it came from people who do not read or follow the instructions. One reviewer from May 2015 basically gave it 3 stars after using it once and saying she had thrown away the instructions and had not read them...so I gave her the instructions in the comments. Another guy reviewed in 2012 and started with doubt that this is truly a &#34;chamois&#34;. He got me so concerned that I started crazy researching on an inexpensive &#34;chamois&#34;. I went to the website for the Sponge and Chamois Institute and read the FTC definitions in FTC Advisory Opinion #1 of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC says.... (1) Any use of the word &#34;chamois&#34; in conjunction with a product not made from (a) the skin of the Alpine antelope or (b) sheepskin fleshers which have been oil-tanned after removal of the grain layer is unlawful and a deceptive act or practice in commerce. So then I looked up what it might cost to do a DNA profile for this &#34;chamois&#34; and found it would be more than $200. Maybe one of you who works in a lab will do the DNA test and let us know what you find.s &#34;chamois&#34; and found it would be more than $200. Maybe one of you who works in a lab will do the DNA test and let us know what you find.
B001CF4UXU|5|100% heavy duty, nice product
B00Q683YZS|5|Good product, good service.
B00TCBKYJA|2|Does not work properly.
B00O5MVOYA|3|Kinda cheap feeling, leave a lot of residue to remove.
B001IGE6ZK|5|Very handy.
B00MB0EXGE|5|This plate holder was so cute. And has really good quality to it. Very reasonably priced. Glad I purchased it.
B00K71B35S|5|Great brush
B000C59YZ0|5|Very Good from Dodge Dakota 2008
B007NNSXEM|5|Used the paint immediately...went on easy and throughly! Love it!
B0075D0SAC|5|perfect fit works great
B00JN2N5C6|5|Good product
B00VM0C5SW|2|Not enough fitment info in ad listing. There are Many years of Wranglers that use different mats!  Thick enough though, sturdy.
B001IWUYIM|5|Good fit for 2001-2003 Suzuki GSXR600 throttle bodies, which are popular for aftermarket fuel injection setups. Sturdy enough to plumb in breather fittings in the rear opening.
B00MTHPAN4|5|Like the look on my motorcycle at night.
B000C7VYNS|5|fit good went to Indiana,next day no issues. Thanks oh and saved 1/2 price on local price if you can wait three to 4 days.
B004S51WMS|5|Great product very happy with it
B005BNZFQ0|5|Works great. Using on Honda 7000 generator. Running 2 air conditioner no heating on cord. Tight fitting at 1st in outlet till I used a couple of times
B000J3YPS6|5|Good price & fast service
B00TWRWGJK|5|Works Great
B0013REXO8|5|Adds a nice touch to anyone's jeep. Quick installation process.
B002Y1X4NS|5|The item met my expectations. Well built and nicely packaged. I would recommend this item and you will not be disappointed.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Its not too sturdily made, but that it what you normally get with a shade that is made out of 2 metal hoops. Its not the easiest to store due to its size and the hoops BUT it fits my 2015 Accord PERFECTLY.
B00LZKHKA2|5|So far so good with these. I did have one that took a while to balance on the first charge but after that, it's dead on even across the cells. They are put together very well and &#34;carbon fiber&#34; faux wrap looks great inside my boat.  Update: Will buy two more of these next week. They run flawlessly with no issues so far. Clearly the best deal out there! Update2: Just ordered another set. The more I use them, the longer my run time. Will post again after I get a read on these.
B000CN74A4|4|I am a grease gun maniac, that s why I ve installed it!<br />Does the job well in comparison with my old OEM cracked rubber bushing<br /><br />Easy to install
B00J4P85RC|5|Excellent Rotors Driven 1500 miles zero sign of wear at all and grabs great!
B00EECLL9O|5|So far so good. Bright!
B0092P1A6C|5|Worth every penny these are not in the window channel so don't interfere with opening closing window
B00192KZQ2|5|Great product!
B005LSO976|4|Lighter than what was expected. Fits well and protects the cargo area. So far, so good.
B001AIZ5HY|5|good
B000GRQIU8|5|Have 2001 honda1100 sabra bought v&h long shots, ran good. Added dynojet now runs better than new!
B00UZTUCAY|4|The only complaint is that since it is a really detailed sticker some of the tiny little lines come off with the transfer tape no matter how firmly you run over it with a credit card, but the lines were so tiny it barely made a difference to the decal. Overall it fufilled its duty of sticking to my laptop and looking like walter so I would say mission accomplished.
B000FOL0AA|5|Great product, works well for my truck
B00B8O7NAC|4|Great price, I bought two to replace the OEM keys that were getting a little beat up. The internal components transfer and work just as advertised. Only negative is that on both keys apparently the grooves aren't cut parralell and so it takes a little wiggling to turn over the ignition on that side of the key. (Locksmith said this is common with Chinese made keys). The key itself has alot of play to it as well but I am hoping that won't be an issue down the road.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with the product and price. (Purchased for a 2006 Jeep grand cherokee)
B003O0Y0BI|5|Works great, extra hardware very convinient! 5star seller!
B004QFK4QK|5|Fit just right!!
B00OL4PEK2|5|perfect
B008G1WI4G|5|The lamps came very quickly and were as advertised. They were pretty easy to install as well.
B00902FT6O|5|Best , ship on time
B00LEBLI82|5|Item was as described. They are much brighter than a standard 12 volt bulb. This is the second set I have purchased. Great value & best price I have found!
B004R34HDC|4|I knew this wasn't the best rack on the market by a long shot but didn't expect the utter crap that I recieved.  The piece was already rusted and one of the tubes was completely corroded and just painted over.  It seems some folks get a decent one but it's obvious Rola's quality control is non-existent.<br /><br />Update:<br />The seller ecustom hitch made it easy for me to exchange for a new rack and this one was top notch.  I think i got a revised version as well as it had all the items people have been using to &#34;rust proof&#34; the rack in the installation kit sans caulk.  I applied caulk and a little waterproof grease to some areas that may rust but overall the new rack was great and appears more than robust for my needs.  This rack won't be installed year round, just when needed so hopefully it'll last longer.
B000BNZPT2|1|Had this unit installed for less than 1 month, tried to open it, and the handle broke off, had to use players to get it to open.  Not a solid product, maybe I just got a bad one, but I would not reccomend this product.
B000HDI4HQ|5|Valterra makes quality products, and this has worked through hot and cold with no drips or leaks.
B002E2YEYK|5|Great yellow color, but not too flashy either.  Installed in a setup that asked for a 880 bulb and works just fine (and is brighter too)
B00BI3JIPG|5|Highest quality and machine finish very nice .
B000BYB5A4|3|I was really expecting the whole pack, but i only received one pc
B0027EUPFC|2|This pump is not high quality but it came with the pool. It's my second replacement unfortunately. I hope I learn more about pumps so I can get a better one. The smart people invest in electricians to splice wires for better pumps,but this is for the three pronged plug into electric socket. I guess I got what I paid for...cheap pool cheap pump. This pump breaks easily and just stops rotating the water. I have unplugged it and put vinegar in the rotor and it started again but it's a constant procedure. It gets corrosion from the chlorinated water and also salt water (I've had both). I am selling mine used here (the new replacement that I bought).
B00APOEQFG|5|Love my Jeep license plate frame!
B00157TGXY|4|Nice that they're &#34;green&#34;, but I don't feel like they work quite as well as the &#34;blue&#34; stuff.<br />Especially smell-wise.
B0073WEZU4|5|Love it
B008BC8G7S|5|Ordered for my husband he loves them and they arrived faster than what they said so very excited and happy with that.  Would order again for sure.
B005J1UK2I|5|They seem to be well made and are better quality than the ones we found at our local RV dealer.
B000OZVL36|1|Catches too much wind, so much so as to slow down mule.
B00318JTCS|4|Awesome light! More spot and overall light than factory headlights. (JKU)<br /><br />Used my own wiring harness, bailed after included one didn't work a couple of tries.
B000RFUF12|5|Works fine !
B00KN0UOEE|5|Nice
B00776H2EW|5|I am using these on a set of No. 17 iron heads. They work. I know they're expensive, but they're worth it. I have only four out of the normal six exhaust bolt holes. Pontiac did not drill the outer bosses in order to save money. I am running Hooker headers with Remflex gaskets and these bolts. It's been three months and I still don't have any leaks. These take time to install, but it's worth it. I totally recommend these for use with headers. My friend is running a Ford small block and his ARP exhaust bolts are coming loose all the time.
B009V06W98|5|yorshire have a standard 13- lb and buy a little doubt because I would not know if he could fit , so I decided to buy it for my other dog that weighs 6 lbs and what is my surprise that the case is super spacious served for thirteen lb but if the dog weighs more than that I do not recommend , the bag is super versatile served in three different ways and all the material is first , is satisfied with the product exceeded my expectations
B008RH73L2|5|This is a high quality sticker.  It is covered on both sides to assist with mounting.  You pull the paper off one side and stick it on.  The stiffness of the paper on the front makes it easy to mount properly.  Then you carefully peel the paper off the front and you're pretty much done.  I got just a couple of tiny air bubbles that came out easily by rubbing with a credit card.  The included directions are excellent.
B002MQCY7C|5|Makes wearing the helmet a snap. Easy to install, no cutting straps and frees up the D loop for helmet locks. Used on for about two months and bought two more for friends.
B00817Z9KA|5|Exact OEM Yamaha part
B0002Z9N7Y|5|thank you!!!
B003BZQ7MG|5|Perfect fit as 3/4&#34; light duty (aluminum) line clamps. If you don't know what line clamps are used for don't buy them and say they don't fit
B0026N51DU|5|Works great and price is great
B0002HRBSU|2|I had 2 bad ones in a row. I'll try another brand.
B001KS2PYK|5|Easy installation!
B00R4YDLNS|5|Great
B00IO4GSBY|5|great quality fit my e60 bmw m5. Nice color.
B0117FXJZ4|3|Grade school boy liked it!
B007RHX4OS|5|Fit in the E60 BMW M5 perfectly.
B00TPZUN5S|5|Haven't installed yet but product looks great and easy to hook up.
B00822Y4E6|1|Fell apart the instant I tried to remove it from the backing.
B000UKETXY|5|Great price
B005C5APWG|5|As with the Saddle Bag guards these are made well,good chrome finish.
B000IYXKBO|4|In and working
B002SCSRSU|5|Awesome, bought multiples of these so I'd have at least one in each car.
B00EKO8J4G|5|It is what it is but you have to make something with it which is the fun part
B00IUWLZMW|5|this battery is used on an electric start generator, fits perfectly and starts. Also installed a trickle charge battery charger, Schumacher SE-1-12S-CA fully automatic.
B001EDBEZM|5|Great quality
B005LPK2W0|4|Package arrived on time, box was a little beat up, minor (very small) blemishes after un packing.. but that's what you get when you ship items that are 50lbs or more.<br /><br />Install is pretty straight forward,  took about an hour. Found some trouble with the frame inserts having a bit of welding slag near the threads.  After running the supplied bolts threw the threads, they took without stripping.<br /><br />I purchased this bumper to match the front bumper that was already installed. (purchased my 08 JKU Sahara used), otherwise I would have picked another option.  Cosmetic wise it looks good,  price is good for what you get.<br /><br />Gave it 4 stars, only because it leaves the corners of the JK a bit more exposed than I would like..  which is fine for this point, as the jeep is 90% street currently.
B00CSXZF2K|5|Makes such a difference when driving the Gator.
B001Q4VILY|5|Works Great !
B000CIPUNC|5|Arrived on time, product as described.
B0010E3JVC|5|I didn't have one installed and car is 12 years old,  Air is really fresh now.  Well worth the purchase.
B005P9SKXA|5|Excellent item. Adds much to my MB.  Class item suitable for a Benz
B004L0AAQY|3|beware.. life of these is SHORT
B005CSQIQK|5|Worked great for xbox one controller,  almost effortlessly!
B00KV8MQ6M|5|Amazing and super bright
B00ATE00KW|1|Didn't  fit fenders too big of gaps,
B006O0DSAO|5|put this on a 1946 willy's jeep , work's great
B00T62RK1U|5|Easy to mount. Work great on my boat. I would recommend.
B00JJBWMDO|5|Great!!
B0000AZ8MD|4|What I was looking for.
B00WA1U7MS|5|What a cool tool and for a great price!  Fits in your hand like a fine glove. LED light is super bright and the tire pressure gauge is easy to read. The tire depth gauge is a neat feature along with the seatbelt cutter and tempered glass removal device. I find this product so good that I am going to buy more of them for family and friends.
B0031HXZB0|4|Part is fine. Promotional 2 day shipping was selected. Did not  receive the part for almost two(2) weeks.
B00FZKVPPE|5|Super bright. Super durable. You get more than you pay for. It out shines my buddy's 50&#34; bar.
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Used to start old SUV. Even tried it with no battery connected and it started the vehicle with no problems. Easy to use. I haven't figured out how many charges it can handle nor how long it holds a charge. I just check it every once in a while and charge it up so it is always ready for battery emergencies.
B0012UI16M|5|Fits like it should...We'll see how it works. (I'm not expecting any surprises.)
B00GPUIZ4C|5|Stickers are fantastic! Good adhesion to the inside of my window and looks great, colors are true to the American flag.
B0090JVTYI|5|Excellent. OEM product and fits perfectly in my 07 Avalanche
B000GTTDFI|5|Easy install and noticeable difference on my 03 Wide Glide. So far I am really enjoying them!
B002UC6NFM|5|Great replacement bulbs for RV.
B000BO9J52|5|Works great. Kinda messy though. Cut a hole in a piece of paper and spray through it to reduce overspray.
B002PQUCJG|5|They look great, fit perfectly, and work, so I am very pleased with these fog lights.
B002G2U0VE|5|The absolute best in a Racing app 2 stroke lubricant. Never had a catastrophic failure in ANY 2 stroke performance app with Red Line. Ultra clean burn and zero residue.
B00B3CXBF0|5|I looks amazing.
B00LY6FX1A|4|Not as light background as in the picture.
B00ANZW28U|1|Smaller than described. Doesn't hold up at all and my car still gets burning hot.
B003O9XX7G|4|Make my truck look good....
B004ZF4MW8|5|Install was super easy, 3 plugs and that's it. 2008 Silverado.

B00545D14I|5|Distance between two neighbour bottom holes- 5.56, between two opposite bottom holes- 7.87, between top hole and stud- 5.56
B004A6JA2O|5|Fits better and is heavier better made than the Toyota filter.
B0027ID0RI|5|Awesome hitch.  Fit perfectly...kurt. bremerton.wa
B00OT59QLQ|4|Got it for my 2005 dodge ram 1500 4.7 magnum. It's fitting from the pipe to my helix throttle body spacer was too big and I even tho there was more room on my hose clamps I couldn't get it to close down tight onto my spacer. It was just crimping the rubber spacer. So I took the original rubber spacer that was between my throttle body spacer to my air box and used it to connect the metal pipe to it. Worked fine. Easy to put to put together.<br /><br />For some reason I can't add a picture but it would definitely help if i could show people how I did it.
B0033YECEK|5|great kit, works like a charm. battery in remote were dead and leaked but except that amazing kit for the price
B004TADG7Q|5|I took off the gallon jugs and put these on.  Jeep looks awesome!
B00QO53GN8|5|Worked fine
B001FMPP3O|5|Perfect
B00498ZR7A|5|These are the Z-71 replacement springs for a 00-06 Tahoe/Yukon. Paired with 2&#34; coil spacers and Extended Bilstein shocks gave me a 3&#34; total lift in the rear from a stock (non-Z-71) Tahoe.  Looks great.<br /><br />Did need coil compressors to fit them in with the spacers, FYI.
B000RN04VU|3|Wore out after a couple of years and too much rain and sun.
B000C59M8Y|5|just what I needed, great price
B000143LHY|1|Complete waste of money. Literally did nothing for the stale cigarette smell in my car.
B00C8E9CMS|4|did the job.
B00K8MRDRS|4|Product arrived on time and fit as claimed; as this is a multi-year battery, it is too early to tell if works as well as the original, but so far so good
B000GD5FMY|3|Glasses seem decent enough, sturdy, well constructed. They are however very tight on the sides on my head, starts to hurt pretty quickly. Overall good for the price, but not very comfortable.
B00FA7KN8W|5|Very nice sticker.. Looks awesome on my truck!  High quality vinyl and the adhesive is very strong.
B000GS23HE|5|Fit great! Bike has never ran so well!
B005GDZPD8|5|This was super easy to install. The first side took a little longer and I needed some extra help getting the bottom spacer bolted in place, but the other side went smooth and problem less. This kit made my truck look so much better by getting rid of the stupid front end sag they come with from the factory. I would HIGHLY suggest to get it aligned after installation like the instructions say. My toe was out quite a bit according to the shop I took it too.
B00MEFH3JA|5|good looking product and shipped really fast
B00YWCCIS4|5|Awesome products,  high quality and fast shipment. Will come back next time.
B00MOYJ0YW|5|These produce nice white light. I had installed plug in LED lights on the interior of my van but a couple of sockets needed fuse type. Now with these in, the van looks really cool in the night. I feel like I'm in an office and when I turn all the lights on you can see everyone clearly!
B002PL5818|2|Right size but pieces were broken so I returned them. Never had that problem with Wagner before but then, I never bought them from Amazon either.
B00RAZP7XS|5|Works great, looks good!
B009S9RURU|5|My niece loves it.
B00LHUI4XM|2|Unable to properly attach security caps as they were not sized properly. Very disappointed as they were one of the main reasons for my purchase. In addition, be careful of the frame itself as it is razor sharp in places.
B00400H08G|1|Never got a complete unit out of 2 different orders but the parts I seen they looked good.
B005202A2O|5|Great Price and Very Quick Delivery!!
B009S2ZQNM|5|Just like the metal one at the auto parts store at half the price
B00KXBNYF4|4|Delivery on time.  This remote comes with the battery. Nice.<br /><br />Takes couple of tries to program all of the remotes. Not too difficult once I found a clip on YouTube showing exact steps.  I just followed the steps as shown and the remotes, old and new, were programed .
B00042KG3A|3|it rusts too quick , its ok
B00PY1U8TI|4|Very bright white light. Good buy.
B004RCX770|5|works great
B000COBLKW|4|Very bright.
B000CF2218|4|Fit my 2003 Ford Ranger 4WD. So far so good.
B00NJRGD70|5|Lightweight and folds easily.
B000CN9T3Y|4|Purchased this for an Acura RSX *(with Koni yellow Shocks). Significantly dropped the rear end of my car but nothing to aggressive. As with performance springs your ride will be stiffer then stock so be prepared to feel those bumps and potholes in the street.
B001AGT3QK|5|Fit my 2000 Legacy GT, easy to put on myself. I was done in 20 minutes.
B000CHIEYK|1|This light sucks
B00K8K104W|5|Awesome light for the price!
B00ELJD0BW|1|I BOUGHT A VAIR PUMP AND FOUND OUT THAT THIS EXTENSION WOULD NOT FIT........INTO THE RECYCLE BIN.
B00JTUBTU2|5|GREAT OIL.  I USED ROYAL PURPLE  IN MY 1MZ-FE BEFORE..MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT THIS IS CHEAPER AND SEEMS TO BE JUST AS GOOD.
B00E9HWS9G|5|This the 5th one I bought for All my cars.
B000C44BPO|5|Works.
B00ZC20NUS|5|This product is great and innovative.  It is very useful to have all the tools necessary put in one portable tool, and have them all work perfectly! You can also tell this product was made with high quality material. Definately would recommend, 5/5 stars.
B000SL0R9K|5|A great little first aid kit. Easy to pack and carry and has just about everything you would need on a hike etc.
B00IIWG0BA|5|Great disc will buy as long as I need disc best stopping on 04 Silverado I've had 360000 miles
B001CJYBGW|5|Fast delivery, item was exactly as described.
B002RSIK4G|5|We put this on our rv and used it on other things and it works great. Would recommend anytime!!!
B000E4RYLA|4|Good replacement. It has more of a matte finish than the original but it doesn't really bother me, especially at this price.<br />These thing can be a little tricky to replace but you can find videos on YouTube that show you how.
B004ME11FS|5|Thanks
B001AWU6KQ|5|Delivered quick, and the went on really easy. This was a great buy!
B000VKVXOG|5|Not a bad little replacement filter. It's flimsy but the plastic frame in my 2005 tC holds it sturdy. I replace these about once a year and they're always just covered in leaves, acorns and junk. One thing to keep in mind, these do need regular replacement. They will either clog up, or if you ignore it like the joker that owned my car before me the filter will fall apart and pieces will get lodged in your HVAC system.<br /><br />It definitely will clean your air, however their claim &#34;Eliminates nearly 100% of exhaust pollutants and airborne contaminants&#34; is absolute bs. This filter is far too porous and makes no real seal like a true HEPA filter would.
B000C40SBK|5|Easy to install under 30 minutes each side.
B000M61L64|3|Threads on screw didn't hold up well. Everything else worked as expected with modified screw.
B0007TJ7GW|5|Great Barrier, easy set up, adjust up and down and side to side....
B000BRFTH6|5|Good quality, works great and fast shipping !
B00MQEIRTO|1|Had to modify to fit.
B00LU4JOOI|4|Looks a bit cheap but was great touch to cake.
B000C0WOY8|5|worked perfectly
B007ZDJ1W8|5|Great replacement if you're looking for better clarity. Fit fairly well on my 96 gmc k1500. Came in a neat, orderly package and was shipped on time.
B00JYXN34Y|4|Ordered 2. First one didn't work. But they had excellent customer service and sent out a replacement immediately. Both of them work great now and I have had them on for about 2 months.
B001EP28DW|5|Worked perfect with Hyundai Santa Fe 2007
B00HL79SSU|5|It's a very complete set, the most complete of any of the portable sets I was able to compare it with.  It locks up well, I mean you won't lose the tools, but some of them won't be in their places when it is opened.  I wonder how they'll do with moisture, not being chromed or plated..but with Craftsman's warranty, or guarantee, I suppose that's not a problem.
B001EOV492|5|As advertised, gotta like that!
B00QSKZO5C|5|Perfect!
B0097SO1QK|4|Arrived fast and works great!
B005LDBU0U|5|Use this on my trip to Sturgis and worth every penny. No butt fatigue. Highly Highly recommenced. Make sure you get the R version which is the latest design with previous customer input. The only thing I don't like is the seat has to come off to put back on. Didn't want to leave it on at our hotel overnight. Way too expensive to have someone rip it off.
B00EFDAJBI|5|Quality item. Fast and good service.
B0048IVY8C|5|Original headlights were so bad that was pulled over multiple times trying to drive at night. Police said unsafe. These new ones solved all the problems. Spot on.
B00KJ8KKRQ|5|amazon ship it fast , its super bright (ordered the 6k) and good quality , worth the money !
B00W8LQE4K|3|nice solid mold. didn't fit had to cut edge off
B000AM8C1W|2|Heat from sun makes it come off.
B0043063JU|3|This mat wasn't the greatest but for the price can't complain,somewhat thin and the folds never did flatten out, also need to be careful when moving anything on this mat , can tare.<br />Did like the design and the reversible sides.
B000RI9GF0|3|The course file is great, the fine not so useful.
B001C4Z0XK|4|Super....Only need steel brackets...
B003CXAPAW|5|Great Product, I've use one from other merchants,  but got spoiled after the first rainy season is over, This product is water proof to some extent and fits really great like a sized glove in the hand, am ordering for another one again in case anything happen this one, cos am not ready to part with my sweet 2011 Corvette soon.
B000FQ07HU|5|No issues.  Fit perfect.
B002EOVDII|2|Upset with charger had to buy a new one. The one I bought from yAll didn't keep my phone charged.
B002M4GF38|5|perfect
B00NTUU8FA|5|This littlegem saved my bacon on a boat trip. I killed my stock diesel lift pump, and thought I needed a spare.  When I did, this item was perfect.  It came with all the needed fittings.  When does that happen..thanks
B00F4K4WA0|5|Perfect! Came on time and as expected. I ordered the Mario mushroom and the Pikachu, and both were in perfect shape and were super cute!
B00AEWA0UE|5|Very good. Happy to do business with.
B00LUS7ERI|4|good
B00DWKYAX8|5|great product
B00GXRM11A|1|Very cheaply made.  Wires were loose and caused my amp and subs to have interference.  Ended up in the garbage.  DO NOT BUY!!
B003ULYNLS|5|Fit perfectly and is indistinguishable from the original.
B008WH2JW0|5|love it fat ship
B002JBMMK4|5|weighs in at 18lbs compared to my stock at 42.8 lbs. love the look i had it painted to match the car. Was a nice DIY project.
B00QK411AS|5|Great wipers!  Bought them to replace the ones the dealer left on my certified pre-owned, which were extremely noisy.  Aero wipers are much quieter, cheaper than what the dealer offered, and quick and easy to install.
B008A5GRHM|5|I used the product 2 days after receiving and was astonished with great results. For once I have ordered a product that exceed my expectations. My avalanche looks new after using carworx refinish restorer, thanks so much.
B004A0XHRE|1|Box arrived as schedule except that the box was open on both ends and only one sheet of wrap and that was laying in the bottom of box. The box was to big for the tool box and it look like they had turned the box over and over getting it to Colorado. All four corners were damaged and dents all over the tool box. Also the paint was clip off.
B00BG6IUUE|4|They look good, fit well.  We didn't have the glue the plastic pieces on like other reviews stated.  They're a little bigger than we expected, but not a big deal.
B004LFCFSK|5|These are the strongest hoses out there, and I won't use anything else.  The elbow fitting it comes with is clear, so you can see what's going down the drain.
B003S5A0I6|1|Part was defective only worked for a couple of weeks.
B002QEFKN0|5|Replaced the original part in my 1998 Ford F-150 4.6L V8. Had a misfiring cylinder earlier this summer. It turned out the original coil was starting to fail for one cylinder. Install was easy, just make sure to reconnect the spark plug cables correctly. This arrived promptly after ordering, and was brand new. I did buy again, to replace the other one on my engine, which was also an original part.
B00029WQTW|5|Good units.
B00AZS8PMM|5|Works as advertised.  We have a 21&#34; in our 5th wheel bedroom. Somewhat stiff even after you unlock it to move it, rather it be that way than otherwise.
B001KSE066|5|seems like good quality and working well so far
B0023VKMZ2|1|TERRIBLE PRODUCT.  I write a fair number of reviews on Amazon, but I've never felt compelled to write one as negative as this one about a product.<br /><br />I originally purchased the light assembly in late March 2015, only to receive a partial shipment in that the bulb was missing and the plastic wiring socket was broken (in small pieces inside box). Eventually, after multiple emails I finally got the spare part in early/mid April, making it the first time I could actually install the product - 6 weeks after order.<br /><br />Then I then installed the assembly in early May, then 6 weeks later, the lens literally disintegrated before my own eyes with my son next to me in the garage, with no contact, jolting, etc. The car was parked, unmoving and untouched.  Poor quality product on both the first and second tries.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
B0088JR9X6|5|Satisfied!
B00C7I4JXC|1|I don't know which idiot claimed that the product was water-repellent because this product is clearly not water repellent. If only I knew that before my phone died because of water damage. I performed a test with a piece of paper towel. It inserted the paper towel into the bags, sealed the top, then poured water onto the fabric. Keep in mind, I didn't pour water anywhere near the draw string. I made sure the water went only on the fabric, and when I took the paper towel out, it was completely drenched. These bag are not even a little bit waterproof. All the water goes straight through the fabric. Now I have a broken $200 dollar phone. If you want a similar experience, be sure to pick this up!
B00KTIYXLU|5|No Brainer for anyone that needs a new FOB it is easy to setup and feels and looks just like OEM.
B00BXLBHQ6|1|Garbage and over price cheap!
B00B2ATTUE|4|Worked great
B00AQBNZ32|1|Crappy workmanship. There is hair stuck under the decal itself and I had to recut the whole thing. I've worked with lots of vinyl and this is the worst I've seen
B008DJ73CI|3|Gasket for maf didnt fit properly. Had to use a lot of gasket sealer for it to seal
B00424HE36|2|The grammar mistake on this sticker means I won't actually be displaying it. That's partially my fault I suppose for not looking closer at the image before buying this. The quality of the print is what I would consider terrible for this day and age. It looks lower quality than if I would have printed it off myself from an ink jet printer at home. On top of that, the seller ships these in plain envelopes which are easily bent (Mine was). So, pretty much a waste of 4 dollars.
B000NVW1LM|5|This product never ceases to amaze me
B00T6SSJKK|5|Works for my 1996 Buick
B00ZZKGN42|1|Just pay for the good ones...<br />**** not reflective at all**** did not even closely match my green paint on my Ninja....
B00332YD8W|5|Went on easy and looks great on my vintage car.
B001RLU0ME|5|No complaints!
B00BQTYZC8|5|good hose
B001GN3H5A|5|Good product
B00R244K1W|3|After taking my time with prepping the wheels, using a tack cloth just before painting, and letting them dry overnight into the day, the finish is so delicate. Bolting the wheels back on got me plenty of scuffs and marks. Hoping that they're a lot more durable come day 7 when paint is fully cured.<br />The color is great, I love it. The finish dries flat, almost matte. So don't expect a high gloss. The more coats, the darker it gets. Also, spraying a clear coat will help durability, but will enhance the matte finish, even if you spray a high gloss one. Take your time prepping paint surface, that's key. Wait at LEAST 24hrs. before mounting back on your car.
B0028DRABE|5|👍🏻
B000HKVDKE|5|Fit is good and cheaper than any other place I checked.  The only issue is on the passenger front, ever now and then when you roll up the window, it will it the vent visor.
B004I0H86C|4|put in ok.
B00K5VNF2E|1|You are gambling if you purchase these. Read, it says they are not Bosch maker of many GM parts and are what is in your Cadilac from the factor. Not from Mexico as these are. I was talked into buying and the price looked tempting. Repair shop sent me on my way with six new coils, spark plugs, and new gasket along with hefty shipping. Four miles down the road engine light came on and repair shop could not clear. Took my Cadilac to GM dealership only to find two coils were bad and none had proper dielectric lube on coil causing problems when connected to spark plugs I am not going to get into. Your correct AC Delco part will have Bosch on the item.<br />So gamble if you must, these parts are crap!!!!
B000C9QU5I|5|Haven't had it but a few weeks but thus far A-OK
B002OUMVWY|5|Awesome and fast delivery
B00F17Q8BM|5|The cord was exactly as described and was sent very promptly !
B0009IQX6I|5|good stuff!
B00317499M|5|Very exceptionel design and it works
B004VY7XRO|5|perfect fit
B004UMB7WY|5|It just works! Rail rust on my car is not a problem anymore!<br />However, the scent wasn't pleasant at all...
B002UKMK1U|5|Awesome
B0085L2MDE|5|perfit fit
B00COPUKMW|4|It fits perfectly. It's made of a soft plastic material, there isn't holes for the tie downs.
B002UC8SIW|3|Works well, but original filter came cracked...reason for only three stars.  Good thing I ordered extra replacement cartridge at same time.  No taste to water coming from campground after installing.
B00JXZKBES|5|Unfortunately I ordered the wrong part.  I called in and talked to Katie who was very personable and was able to be a tremendous help to me!  I wouldn't hesitate calling to talk to one of their representatives for help.  Would like to personally thank Katie for helping and understanding! Next time I will call in to order the part.  Mahalo!!!
B0077S7J0M|2|Front ones fit without a problem, couldn't say the same for the rear
B00C6CWJFE|1|box seals are troublesome, arrived damaged
B00S7ZLEQE|5|Bright and well constructed a bit pricy
B00004RA7R|5|Handy, works better than the ancient all-steel grease gun I carried about for 30 years...pumps each time, every time, and cheap enough I can toss several where I'll have one when I need it. Having the bar well-greased has proved a definite plus for saw efficiency...!
B00HFWYZO8|5|I love the rug they are tuff and durable
B00FQ0ROZS|5|These lights are bright and easy to install. Definitely a good buy for trail lights for 01 xj
B00PCRD6IO|3|much better if it was metal not plastic
B00ERXG4TM|5|Works well. The thumb wheel is nice to get the proper tension. Had one without it before and it would slip.
B0012TNKRS|5|Easy to assemble.
B004I9XYIE|1|bought new, mine came scuffed up and missing screws.
B00WNGV0WG|5|This is a great seat that I am not sure how any person with mobile children can live without for car or plane travel. I was initially confused, thought it would be a tray with raised sides upright, as shown in the picture. But then I figured out raised sides like that wouldn't allow it to be the correct height for each kid. It has a strap that can be snapped around the waist like a belt so the tray stays on their lap without moving and it had a raised lip on the sides to stop toys, crayons, or goldfish crackers from careening off the edge. The surface is hard enough that it can be used as a surface for eating, playing, or coloring or drawing, and there are multiple pockets on each side that zip to hold any item you can think of. It also folds flat, if you pack the pockets well, so is not a bother to try to transport or store, and could be slipped into the back edge of a carry-on bag to be used as a tray table that is their height on a plane. I purchased this product at a discount for an honest review with an upcoming long flight for my nephew in mind, and am thrilled that this turned out to be such a good product for him to use.
B00H8EEWUA|5|Okay, I have used this tool on a 2010 Camry LE, 2011 Corolla S, and 2012 LE Camry, can you tell I am a Toyota guy?  it worked great on all 3.  As I have seen stated else where, the car dealerships seem to take joy in making shade tree mechanics life miserable and will tighten the canister to the point you can barely get it off.  The typical torque requirement to install the canister is like 20 to 30 foot pounds not 90.  The torque required to install the canister is molded into the top of the oil canister.  As others have said, if you use a 3/8&#34; drive socket on the tool you will likely break the tool, get the correct metric socket.  I believe it is a 24 or 27 mm.  Some of these tools I have seen no longer have the 3/8&#34; socket built in, it is very tempting, but don't use it.  Take the time and make sure you lineup the tool correctly with the notches in the tool with the tabs on the canister and fully engage the tool with the canister.  You will probably need to gently tap the tool to get it off the canister after removing or installing the canister.
B00K24715Q|4|Good Product.
B00ILDJ99Q|5|Works as intended great product and superb warranty 
B00MLKCGHC|5|Awesome! High quality
B000P6WM78|2|the only thing that works on this tool is the easy out the tool fits none of the fittings on my truck or tractor grease guns are good this tool is a waste buy a 1/4 deep socket set for most and modify them for the angle fittings
B007IXRKVY|2|dial indicator gauge popped loose after 2 days.  Quality is not the best. Paid more money for this one rather than the cheapy ones but not happy with the quality.
B00D4K06ZW|5|Awesome
B000C2Y1L0|5|good heater hose fit well
B0079GQKDE|5|Gets the job done.<br />Highly recommended.
B000RZR2W2|5|Works as intended. Leaves a nice finish, however will not provide a showroom shine. That can only be obtained with a new gel coat.
B0008FUF34|5|Perfect fit for my 2&#34; hitch.
B000BPZ4SW|1|worst piece of crap I have ever bought DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! broke pretty much as soon as I bought it
B00K7YZSFG|5|works great!
B00IF5H974|5|good
B00EZ85W7O|5|Fit my friends Mazda 6 great.
B006FRGGXC|3|I expected at least a noticeable difference in the length of throw, but was unable to feel any difference compared to stock...  It looks better than the stock shifter, but u never see it anyways, so that doesn't really matter. Probably would have been better to put that money towards something more worthwhile.  Installation was pretty easy though - took about 20 mins!
B008NO5XTI|5|07 FJ fits as said, does make a sucking/ whistling sound but I thinks that's from the sir filter system I have
B0062IJOJ2|5|Great product.. Works great..
B00EKEGRVS|1|These were absolutely horrible.  They broke the first time we tried using them --snapped right apart.
B0044FPNIG|5|Works very well on my large garbage can.
B00588T81Q|5|I changed my fog lights on a 2014 Outback and these fasteners are almost identical to the OEM's. Only a very slight difference that will NOT effect its function. They fit perfectly. I imagine that these fasteners would be $5 a piece at a dealership.
B00G620ZVU|5|very well made
B001PYG98C|5|Good product and fast delivery
B00XZ9MXQM|4|It's good and everything works except for the trunk button but besides that I think it is well priced and a good spare
B001DYVPTW|5|Wow so impressed, just take your time when you're installing and it comes out looking like a brand-new steering wheel!! Well worth the money, looks factory!!
B00COYNZJ8|5|I love it
B00XAX4B9A|5|I got this a few weeks back and you can see that it fits my pickup perfectly and has shown no signs of wear. It is light weight and folds down to a very compact size. It also comes with a bag to store it in as well when it is not in use.<br /><br />The sunshade is a thin material with 2 wire hoops inside. These wire hoops keep it in place and shape to protect the dash. When you fold the sunshade in half then twist the and fold again makes it fit into the carrying bag for it. It breaks down to about the size of a frisbee for easy storage.<br /><br />To place the sunshade to protect your dash. First you remove it from the carrying sleeve. Next you unfold it and place all the way to the back of your dash. There is a soft area between the 2 wire rings this will go up under your mirror. From there you put your sun vizors down if you want but it is not absolutely needed.<br /><br />If you are in the market for a compact sunshade to portect your dash this is a great product to consider. I would like to thank SoSimple Brands for sending me this sunshade for my truck to try out and share my opinion.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

B0064SPBSS|4|I bought a 2015 buick encore so I wanted a girlie buick key chain. This is cute, but I thought  it was a little  pricey.
B001FANQLE|4|So far so good
B0030YWM0Y|5|As advertised!
B00BN45Q56|5|great
B00W7AN2XI|5|Works perfect. Placed on my John Deere 430 garden tractor. Easy install.
B003TTPIP6|2|The heels wore down and ripped off.
B00SLLYH0O|5|bought these as a birthday gift to a good friend, she had them installed. They looked really good, I actually like them better then the tubular original ones. the originals had three support brackets these have two, but I weigh over 200 pounds and they seem to take my weight fine.
B001S8F2V0|5|Same as dealership but cheaper works perfect 04 Silverado 360000 miles
B0002NYBC8|5|So far so good. Used on son's 1996 Civic 3 weeks ago. AC working great
B00KXNWJD0|3|The paint was an ok match for the paint on my 2014 Mazda 3. The kit is well put together and includes the supplies you'll need (you'll have to get your supplies for cleaning the scratch and the pens).
B00TG9JMQE|5|worked fine on 2010 sym symba scooter,EZ installation
B00REDMNG0|5|Really nice color. I don't really feel it has a physical texture compared to other &#34;carbon fiber&#34; vinyl that I've seen. But I love orange and carbon fiber looks so this product is perfect for me.
B0061RG5KU|5|Awesome!  Solid and heavy.  Fits perfectly out of the box.  Adds a nice subtle touch to the interior.
B00MOR4DEQ|1|I can't believe all the positive reviews, people must be judging on the &#34;looks&#34; of the light.  The brights on these things are useless, overall illumination actually DECREASES when the brights are turned on (I think its because with both bulbs on, the direct reflector effect is washed out).  The light is whiter, and the illumination directly in front appears to be brighter, but I can tell the &#34;throw&#34; is worse.  When comparing the standard halogens to these, the halogens act more like &#34;spot&#34; lights, while these act more like &#34;flood&#34; lights.  The halogens are &#34;yellow&#34; while these are &#34;white&#34;.<br /><br />Although distant reflector signs are bounced back well, distant dark objects are not illuminated well.  Anything close is well lit.  Although they are not &#34;blue&#34;, 6500K is probably too cool and probably not as effective as 5000K.  The other concern I have is the fan housing does get pretty hot, I'm curious if anyone has actually tried these driving all night.<br /><br />I installed these on a Hummer H2.  No issues with flickering or codes.<br /><br />The ineffective brights will be the deal killer for me.  Sending back.
B005XOJLA8|5|Great pricing and came quick. Looks great and is much brighter than my stock bulbs.
B000AA4RWM|5|Best price and quality level for my RV.  Pleasantly surprised  I received 2 levels was expecting 1.
B00BVB58R2|4|For install go on youtube for a simple swap replacement tutorial. Since I have installed  I haven't any issue besides the fact that sometime it can be hard to pull. I am currently looking into how to adjust that or if it can be adjusted.
B0009OMYAQ|1|Doesn't fit 2005.5 Audi A4, 3.2L even Amazon Auto says it'll fit. Returned it.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Just love it.
B002SA0SCA|5|We bought this for a replacement gas cap for our 18 foot Suntracker Bass Buggy.  Works great and seems to be accurate in telling how much gas we have!
B001FZNIL2|5|use on utility trailer
B007KPVRHS|5|Not a quick installation, but worth it.  No moving parts to wear out and allows use of stock grips.  Heats hot enough that I rarely have it turned all the way up.  It does take a few minutes for the heat to radiate through the handlebars and grips, but not too big of an issue.  This is what Harley should have equipped the bikes with from the factory.
B0006SH4NC|5|I use this to remove water spots every time I pull my boat out of the water. Works great! Best looking boat in the marina
B00EFTDIHY|4|Tha`s what you need
B00F5LPDH4|2|Need to return it
B004BSOIIM|5|My mechanic recommended this for my transmission (he swears by it) as it's been running a little rough. It seems to have helped.
B00ISBE7W0|2|Very disappointed.  I have used sleep sprays before and had high expectations, mostly because it's expensive and well, if people &#34;discovered it while traveling in Europe&#34;, it must be fantastic, right?  Well, I loved the smell, initially, but it's wow effect on the pillow wore off only after 2 or 3 days,. It most definitely did not help my sleep.  I sprayed it on pillow and my wrists.  After a few days, the scent seemed very weak and watered down to me.  And I paid $55 for this large size of nothingness?  My favorite and most effective sleep spray is called Deep Sleep by The Body Shop, it's a lot cheaper and the formula is much stronger in terms of knocking you out and fewer wakings throughout the night.<br /><br />Well, I'm glad I tried this stuff - the mystique is gone.<br /><br />Perhaps this product would be fine for someone with no experience with sleep sprays.
B000CPI6VI|5|Excellent quality and fitment
B004U5F1VE|2|We are not very happy with these helmets. They do not fit our heads right, there is hardly any padding in them at all. Wearing them I do not feel that my head is protected. Bought 2 of these helmets and not happy with either size. Very difficult to put headsets in. Not a great purchase.
B00FY80WAG|5|good
B00HV0RW62|3|Kind of hard to put on the backseat and steering wheel
B00ODW3ETK|5|great
B006570YS0|5|Really happy fits as it was suppose to. Awesome!
B0048ECMYQ|5|After days of searching for aftermarket mats that would best fit our 04 Odyssey I finally found these on Amazon. I was skeptical about the color and quality at first but when the mats arrived I was very happy about my decision. Even the packaging blew me away. I am once again a happy Amazon customer.
B004AIJ5PY|1|I was told this product would fit my car but it never did I actually had to purchase one from Advance Auto Parts
B0002RNSIC|5|Hardest part of this install on a 1st Gen Xterra was removing the cover on the vehicle (OEM) plug. It was covered with undercoating and hard to see with the poor lighting I had. A careful look at the connector on the hopkins wiring showed me how it attached which made it easier to remove the OEM connector cover. Kit came with connector grease so the connections should be good for long time.
B000NCOKV0|5|Should have gotten one of these years ago ! Perfect for the RV in the off season.
B000CEBWJC|5|1999 Dodge Ram 5.2 quad cab. Buy this product now. Don't wait. You will love it. Easy to install and minor cutting of the extension pipe.
B00WW87XU8|5|Was unsure at first, price was $23.99 for a 2-pack + free Prime Shipping.  Just one of the lift supports from the Dealer (about 50 miles away) was $22.  When I checked Auto zone and O'Reilly, they both could get them for $34 a piece, but they had to be ordered and would not be at the local store for a minimum of 2 days.  So, I took the chance with this seller on Amazon and Paid the extra $4.99 for overnight shipping.  With shipping, I spent $28.98 for the 2 lift supports and they arrived the next day.  Very happy with the price paid and speed of shipping.  Item was just as described, and I spent half of what I expected and received them in half the time.<br /><br />So, My wife drives a 2012 Nissan Pathfinder.  The Tailgate would no longer stay up on its own (It is pretty heavy) and had become a real nuisance.  You could not load or unload anything from the Pathfinder without an extra person to hold the tailgate.  When trying to do it by yourself, it usually hit you in the head or back as it closed before you could get out from under it.<br /><br />The new lift supports were the same size and appeared almost identical to the Original ones.  A quick YouTube search, and I found several short video's demonstrating how to change these on similar vehicles.  I was able to remove the old supports and install the new ones in about 10 minutes, by myself.  They worked perfectly, and now the tailgate is easy to lift up and stays open on its own!  The install would be easiest to have someone hold the tailgate up while replacing the supports, but if doing it by yourself, I recommend using a step ladder that is tall enough to put under the tailgate to hold it up.
B001B3UUB4|5|For the price, it's worth it.  1999 Dodge Ram 5.2.  Perfect fit and it keeps the plug wires cool.
B000BUU5YA|5|Just what I needed.
B001P2EYZ4|5|Was a quick shipment, and installed like the old one. Looks great and functions well.
B00LG07MZE|5|“I have a 14' Honda Odyssey - needed a BIG shade for the windshield and this certainly fit the bill..very eash to fold and slide between the seats for storage...was use to having individual shades but this design actually blocks more sun from getting through....simply pull down the sun visors and slip the shade behind the end corners...”
B00555OGNW|5|Perfect for my double leads from alternator to the batteies then my amp. Heavy duty. I've had this for a few months and is holding up well.
B008VJZ6YW|5|Looks great.  Works great. Easy to put on. Love it!!
B00O6MGJG2|4|good
B000GTW5NA|5|Work well.
B00JLVWDO0|5|Bought for my 2000 Honda Civic Si with the stock B16A2 motor. Perfect fit and easy to install. Nothing else was needed. It was direct replacement. Hoses fit perfect. This a great upgrade and keeps motor cooler than stock radiator.
B005R27ZK4|3|Arrived in time but dont blieve it when it says it will fit your car
B001O1UF2W|4|The part that have the word pilot written on it is too  sharp ,needs fileing down ,can cut your fingers
B001HZKRGE|4|I replaced both the left and right front struts. This right strut fit in perfectly and works well, the only issue I have is that the nuts that came with it were not round. they were slightly ovaled and when I tried to use them it started to strip the top bolts, so I was forced to reuse the old strut bolts. Otherwise this would get a 5/5
B007Q4T6YY|4|very happy with the NOKYA brand.
B00CIX2X3Y|5|took 10 seconds to install. works great in 05 Forster for AC relay.
B0007IN3M2|5|Works for the reason I bought it.
B00G3H6ZA8|5|Love it !
B00NNFT09G|5|The hub caps came in,  were brand new.  Even though I didn't use them for an oem replacement,  they fit enkie rpf1 perfectly.  And the silver matches their silver also!
B00DIX0ZSS|5|Used these on my black factory wheels, 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  They worked perfectly and are an exact match for the factory chrome lugs.
B00029WSVS|5|Very good replacement for the original.  Seems well built and solid. Good clear glass. Looks like it belongs in my '95 Sonoma.
B001CF1A6U|5|It's from Smittybilt - enough said!!!!!
B00HSO37B0|5|Great buy!  This makes putting the hitch into place on the vehicle very easy.  I am a first time owner of a travel trailer and I didn't know how heavy the ball/hitch was!  I am glad I found this product.
B000N4Q070|5|It meets all of my requirements. I have limited garage space so the ability to move it around is a GREAT option.
B009D3JJGQ|5|Good floor mats
B0012TRPGU|5|Super productive
B001G6MYEM|5|This arm was an exact replacement in fit, appearance, and perceived quality for the arm that I removed from my 2005 C55 AMG. It comes equipped with a replacement nut for the original single-use nut on the factory arm and is therefore fully ready to install.
B00JM6NH1M|1|Horrible quality, first set of shocks I received lasted a few days, one had a leak and the other shock shredded the shroud surrounding the shock, and the shroud got lodged in the cylinder. I returned that pair and now 4 months later the latest pair has done the same thing. Do not buy. I'm out $700 for some shocks that lasted me just 3,000 miles.
B009RC2HVC|5|Matches OEM
B00LPIA3T4|3|Not the best metals to work with but it has what i need for now. You definitely get what you pay for.
B000CMH41E|5|Looks great and works well on my Isuzu pup project.

B00JHEOR2C|5|Excellent quality, excellent price.  Looks great on my bike!
B00AN8LY2M|5|Got here early and fit perfect on my 08 zx6r
B000BUU5WW|4|Works well but the plastic is flimsy so you need to be careful.
B000C59WF2|4|Good Quality tie rod end. There is no place to hold backup on the knuckle bolt. The old one had a place for a star wrench in the end of the bolt. Nothing on this one. I used a C clamp to hold the tie rod in place and put pressure against the taper until I got the nut tight enough for it to hold itself.
B00DRWK8DM|5|Looks great on a WWII vet's VFW hat.
B000DZBHLI|5|Fixes holes in  everything
B000W7F2GI|4|Very handy brake bleeder. Works well and is pretty cheap. You could build one yourself for a little less but much easier to fork over the extra $5
B0033WNNR4|5|Arrived on time and fit my 2012 GMC Terrain perfectly.  Instructions were very good and installation was easy.
B0002JMFHU|4|Its a hose. Works fine
B00TYZLH1I|3|I have a 2015 Subaru Legacy with Eyesight. This is not a good fit.
B00FJXKE5E|5|Good for school buses.
B000C9KVHQ|4|fits. great part, will last longer than the stockers for sure.
B0019IC94W|5|A pain in the butt to put one of these in, but after finishing up the task all is well and working just fine!
B0042XORMI|5|I saved a lot of money, thank you.<br />Excellent shipping time.
B000IYP6JI|5|I'm driving my Tahoe with no problems
B005G0ZSJM|5|AWESOME & EASY TO INSTALL..
B001QJ9JX8|5|Installed and working great
B001DKPMAO|5|Not bad
B00ZKTXCRO|5|Nice and bright..
B00695Q3P6|1|So you guys actually WANT to drive and eat, or be on a tablet or a laptop?
B0040CW0PM|2|too very small and weak for 2010 Toyota Camry, does not work for fender of Camry...
B00QFFPN74|5|Excellent!  My daughter loves it.
B003ZWHW6A|5|Great product at a fraction of OEM cost.  Fit my truck perfectly and installed in about 5 minutes.
B008Y75G32|5|easy to replace and worked like a charm, just got the codes cleared with the dealership....
B00JEUHPO6|5|Just as good as the Mopar part... Fits my 2007 unlimited perfectly.
B009XU8W6W|4|Shipping was fast product was good but was missing a couple screws otherwise they would have received 5 stars
B000CODS80|2|I used this on a 69 Firebird. It didn't work; it's too close to the cowl on the passenger side. I ended up using a hook from the 1$ Harbor Freight Hook and Pick Set to release the tab.
B00032K4FG|4|needs weather proof, New England, pads/bumpers - sounds rattily - otherwise good
B0049CK79E|5|Easy to install and meets all expectations.
B0009YIE14|5|Used this in my front receiver to move license plate down to make room for light bar in my bumper. Worked great!!!
B00DJ5KE9U|5|Works well. Keeps battery on lightly used forklift charged fully.
B00MIDVUNI|5|Awesome product
B001TJZ6IC|4|Great
B00K87MK1C|1|This was not an exact fit for a 1976 DT100.  Throttle linkage would not work properly when installed.  Differences in throttle body sizes compared to the original carb caused the problems.  It was also sightly damaged during shipping due to poor packaging.  I did not use this carb, it was not worth the effort to figure out how to get it to work in my bike.
B001F0MOUS|3|I would consider this more a cleaner than a waxer.  It does go on and come off easy but wouldn't count on it for your deep waxing needs.  If you are cleaning up after a trip or before showing whatever it is you are waxing, it gives a nice temporary shine but doesn't last anywhere near as long a a true rub on and buff off wax.
B00APOFQYQ|5|Perfect fit, cheaper than buying directly from dealer.
B00480J4I2|5|Fast shipping and bulbs worked good
B00ZZO0448|4|Fast shipping.  And they work. Although a few of the solders were busted connecting the bulbs to the base.
B00BG916KC|5|Worked great. Very easy to install.
B0002JM8PY|5|Great for models
B0017LQT0G|4|Great fit and keeps the heat out here in the desert of west Texas
B0028JQYSS|1|Broke the first time I lifted a wheel off the ground!  Not even worth trying to return it.
B004GCGZC0|5|Works great
B00407TTQK|5|This paint matched my 2002 explorer perfect.Sprayed perfect.Don't see why other reviews were bad. There is a white piece of plastic on nozzle ( Do not remove)<br />U couldn't of bought any better paint to match  and spray on any better.
B007Y55IL0|3|Opening for rear-view mirror is too narrow on 2004 Hyundai Sonata LX.
B00CPSRZ12|5|Fit is perfect and helps keep the heat out.
B002OM8TQE|5|I love the mid summers night. The fragrance has almost lasted a month and everyone that rides with me loves it also.
B001DRHMZU|5|It works
B00DM8NIHE|5|Originally had an issue, which was my fault, with the right part number for the year of my truck. Reflective Concepts contacted me and went above and beyond in customer service to make sure I received the right one. It installed easily and really looks great.
B001G9KC1G|5|works great
B004VNE4WC|5|Love it though it was a little to big but I still love it
B00BCRMBGQ|4|I originally purchased the Oxgord 17 pc Car Seat Cover Set for my Honda Odyssey because the help tab at the top of the page said this would fit my van seats however, once I started trying to place the seat covers on (started with the driver seat) I realized that they are too small. Maybe my van has overly stuffed seats but the covers just did not fit all the way on like shown. I only needed the front and back seats covered since I have 2 babies in the captains chairs. The set itself is nice and made with breathable polyester and foam padding so that you always stay comfortable while the seat remains protected. I did find that the cover was a little thinner than I would expect and I was afraid it would tear easily as well. I was not thrilled with having to &#34;cut&#34; holes in the cover either to fit the seat belts...figured for the price it would have those already and the smell that the cover has is not in the slightest way good. It smells like chemicals even with the windows open. I'm sure it needs to just air out but to what cost? I have to drive and not pass out from the smell.<br /><br />The cover set is black in color and comes with a steering wheel cover, 4 seat belt covers, 2 bucket seat covers and 1 rear bench cover. The set is 100% washable and protects your car seats from spills and stains. An overall nice seat cover set...if you have the right vehicle seats.<br /><br />I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.
B001KZJ82U|5|oem-like  fit for my 98 swb with 26gal tank, and has accurate gauge reading..
B00064LOJ6|5|Great product
B00B3YMOUQ|5|Tail Bag included makes<br />awesome Baggage!!
B00WFQ928I|4|Good lamp.
B005FRGKDO|5|I like it, The front seats wear easy to install but the back seat was kind of tricky.
B00GTNZS0O|5|After more than 6 months, solved my misfire problem.
B000C9OHKI|5|Good quality part. Buy it.
B006E0PE88|1|this parts is not complete some are missing ,no time to return next time complete your parts not recomend
B011CVDK48|5|By far best company for your automotive lighting needs! Accurate descriptions and reasonably priced. I ordered 3 different sets of lights and all look perfect!
B00CRPAHKE|4|Can't beat for the price. Perfect for filling the boat with 5 gallon cans
B00LNKW9S2|5|Exactly what I needed
B003CGDSBC|3|Holds well, but the extinguisher flops around
B00I1B6LE4|5|Great Quality and easy to install with basic tools! Highly recommended.
B00BRTQRG4|5|It took 30 minutes to install but the truck had less then 15000 miles. Sounds great very loud you can really hear the turbos . The wife says it's to loud
B008WA7E36|5|works good!
B00BRHM8FA|4|expensive, but does more than the procal i had.  i upgraded mine to the flashpaq (makes it become a model number 3571).  just after paying for the upgrade, i get an email from superchips about a &#34;half price upgrade special&#34;  WTF??? but its a good unit.
B00FN2K1UY|5|Perfect fit on my 2015 Soul. after all it is a factory fit
B00JCE4QNM|5|We are very pleased with the Seizmik Versa-Shield we purchased for our JD Gator.<br />It is especially great when you get caught in a rain storm as I did before we got<br />the shield.  Then yesterday I got caught in another rain storm and it was nice<br />to stay dry and also be able to see where I was going!!  Thank you for a super<br />product!!!!
B00GSAUHB8|1|I'm not really sure why this item is so highly rated. I purchased two of them -- one for my wife's 2013 Honda Civic and one for my 2014 Honda CR-V. These were very flimsy and poorly made. They were also very small and didn't fit either one of our windshields. We paid $14.95 at the time but I see the price go as high as $34.95 for one. That is an absurd amount to pay for these. I would not recommend them to anyone unless they were under $10. They're cheaply made and not as good as you would have hoped for.
B004GCDU32|5|This is the real deal, fits great!
B00FH795WU|1|The light does not look as it was described in the picture's and sometimes only half of my lights will work. 😠
B004QKLSO2|5|These work great and are exactly what I was looking for!
B00SLY938C|5|Good fit, it was just what I wanted
B002N25JD6|1|I thought I was getting a lower grille instead I got some cheap plastic and some of it fell off  the same week.the rest I had to take off looked terrible
B0040M87TA|4|Good
B004AEXWXY|2|was not an exact fit and had to be modified to work
B00ABYVT64|4|Excellent quality bottles, but make sure you store them upright.  I had them in a gear bag in the trunk or my car, sideways, and they leaked through the nozzle or neck.  Luckily, I had it in a ziploc bag.  I'm using them to store some Meguiar's G3626 Ultimate Wash & Wax Anywhere Spray to keep my car clean whenever and wherever I am.
B00IO4EYMY|5|Do you like Alaskan winters?  Because that's how my car feels after putting in 2 cans of this stuff.
B00D5CGGU8|2|The starter was the correct model and arrived very quickly. Unfortunately, after only 4-5 starts, the nylon gear was shredded with half the thickness of the teeth sheered off. They did include a spare, so I'm wondering if this might be common?  Regardless, it definitely should have lasted longer than it did. My husband was able to remove a metal gear from the old starter and replace it for now.  I guess it's common to use the nylon rather than a metal gear, which is too bad, since it results in a lower quality item. Will update if needed.
B0087ZX4TO|1|Did not fit my 97 Ford E150 passenger front door as stated. When I checked back it states that it fits passenger front door in one place and up at the top it states fits rear door. Not worth the trouble to send back. Maybe just got numbers mixed up somewhere. Looks like it is made for a cable hookup instead of a rod? When I got mine off and looked at it was just a lose screw so put it back on. Used plastic push rivets to fasten it on, time will tell if they last.
B00L4JP52O|5|It arrived on time in good condition.  The only problem was that it was a six button remote while mine was a five button.  It still worked.
