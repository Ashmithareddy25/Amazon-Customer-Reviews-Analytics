B000OV4ST4|5|Works great
B000CN95VA|5|I used these for custom motor mounts (there is a how-to on this making the rounds on the net) and it worked great. Inexpensive, too. What's not to like?
B003XC1H0E|5|Thanks
B000JZF5S8|5|In case you didn't know, Delphi is OEM for a lot of GM electrical parts, including this one.<br /><br />So as you'd expect, this part was an exact fit. I'm happy to report that aside from the normal difficulties of replacing this part on the S-10 trucks (you have to remove pretty much everything on the passenger side under the hood and drop the wheel well to get clearance), I had no trouble installing it, and it works great.
B001F1XYHY|5|Nice looking bags . Look good on bike
B000OZVL36|2|Hard to see through. Spend money and get a real windshield. But if you cant afford one this will fit the bill. Does work well keeping dust out. But you really dont need one inless your following some one in the dirt. Plus the faster you go the more it seem to push against my hand against the steering wheel. I have a 07 rhino. Or if you hate bugs hitting your face its a plus for that as well. We used when we were in a group. But was ready to take it off when riding alone. Plus it does hold heat in cab. Which would be a plus in winter but not in hot summer. I will be getting me a half  windsheild in the near future and selling this on a local website. Good idea but not for this guy.
B001RLU0IS|5|They work well considering they are only 2days old. I like to treat my car to nice little goodies so I bought these to replace the stock ones. I will gauge the mileage soonish when my tank is empty.
B0091YV1F4|5|great mod for a 1998 jeep TJ - awesome light up dash - now to do the heater
B007OW6M0Y|5|These definitly stopped the leakage of my 2007 Scion Tc
B001L9PYS2|2|Its not a light blue its super dark and orange inside its somewhat bigger than xtra small so if you want a light color do not order
B007AOSH0E|5|Very nice fit, life saver for an active family with kids and dogs.
B0002F66EW|5|Fits like a glove...a big white round glove...for a tire.
B00B57TTKO|4|Unfortunately I haven't been able to use this.  I never looked at how my headrest was attached, as I thought they were all the same.  But when I started to install this, I discovered my headrest only has one attachment.<br /><br />I can use it in the car I don't drive as often, but it already has cup holders, so there is not as much need.  I haven't installed it there, yet.<br /><br />It is a thin plastic, but, for the price, it should do the job if the drinks aren't too heavy.
B0014YG86G|4|Been great do far. Nice solid ride in the rear now. This product does come 2 to a box too. Ordered 2 because I was lazy and didn't read the Q&A stuff. But Amazon was great about taking the second order back for full refund.
B00XK4PTOK|5|For once a product fits as advertised!
B00CMY2G3G|5|This key chain was given as a gift to my sister in law. Purple is her favorite color she loves the key chain.
B003HB2AFM|2|They look good hard to install because you dont know if the fit is right or not couldnt get mine flush to rim.. While trying to figure out what size fits best (1 out of 3) I cracked one of the hubcaps trying to press it into place.. Hope it doesnt catch wind and fly off..
B009VOQ05U|1|P.o.s. could of had made something more useable out of balling wire and zip ties
B000M5W25E|5|This item was exactly what I expected.
B003CR2BP0|5|exact fit works great
B00030BXG2|2|Print quality is poor, and the manual did not include discussions of all features of my car that might/do need repair.
B00C0UA3HS|4|The item fit like OEM.  It arrived on time and quickly.  A GREAT experience.
B00EQ9GPZK|5|Bought them primarily for protecting my hands and levers, but when they got to me, I was impressed on how nice they look, how much the deflector protects from wind and how steady they are when hitting them hard against anything!!
B001Y8NEX2|3|This is a good product for a quick fix if the surface is very flat and very smooth. I ended-up using silicone caulk as I had a rough surface and that worked great until I could replace the awning.
B00HBFJ1YI|1|I bought this to replace the G4 halogen in our range hood.  Because the bulb is enclosed this LED replacement only lasted a few hours.  When it worked it looked nice but I obviously expected it to last longer but came to realize that it isn't for all applications.  Make sure you have good ventilation and the lamp is not enclosed.
B00KQVM4W0|4|Solid container. Thread sizes are unusual; same thread size on top and bottom, but barb sizes are larger on one of the fittings (2 @ 3/8&#34; and 1 @1/2&#34; i believe). Thread appears to be 12mm x 1.0 (or close to 1/2&#34;-27) but neither of those are standard sizes or easy to find a standard size hose barb.<br /><br />For what I need it for it will work well; if you are contemplating a simple install you may want to continue your search
B00LMGG99C|1|Cheap as cheap gets very poor quality
B000CD5OR4|4|Item arrived in a timely matter.  Item was as described.  It was an exact fit for my car. I would recommend this to others.
B0050VFAOK|5|It's small and not bulky like the others and not as loud as the others either. I like the flexibility that it bends to fit in awkward areas of the vehicle.
B000BFR6TM|5|High quality ,  perfect fit and easy install. Made old new again. Awesome.
B00CCU4IYA|5|These are way cool. Put them on my toy hauler. Price is alittle high, but if you want plain jane lights you can find those half the price of these. Makes my out dated trailer looks newer.
B0024ECAE4|2|I need to replace all the locks on my 5th wheel camper equipment storage doors. The Camco #44303 looks like what I need, but there is not enough information on this product to make the purchase. I need several of these locks, but I want them all keyed the same so that there is only one key for all, but it is not clear that this will be the case. When a statement is placed on this posting that all of the locks on a single order will be keyed the same, then I will purchase.
B006M3IMZY|5|happy
B003NGFFDA|5|Perfect fit and color replacement for my old Prowler shower. Love the 1/4 turn handle, you can even run it with your toes!
B000B68V6I|5|Great price, shipped right to my door.
B000A6E9RY|5|I mounted this in my garage.  I have a classic car with no passenger side mirrors so I never know how close I am to the side of the garage.  This mirror gives me a clear view of the side of the car and the garage so I know exactly how much room I have.
B0080HTWM2|4|It looks great on our new Focus and was valued very reasonable. Next will be the seat covers to complete the Disney car.
B001G5TTHS|5|I slapt it right on to my 96 Acura Integra and it stopped the leak I was having immediately, I guess the gasket wearing out after awhile is why it starts leaking. Good product!
B000AL2RI2|5|This worked as it should have. I used it along with new coil packs and plugs for my F-150 and, well, the truck is still running! I still have some left, but if I ever ran out and needed more, I would purchase it again.<br /><br />I Hope this review helps in your decision making process and please be sure to rate it if it did! Thanks for reading!
B009IFIGP4|5|Perfect size EASY installation!  To remove the old one easy too. I am very happy THANKS
B0049E7XYO|5|easy replacement on my 2003 Suburban. works good.
B007KIMALC|5|Great equipment.  Worth every cent considering the confidence you have when working under a vehicle in you garage. Very, very happy with this purchase.  Makes the standard 3ton jack stands seem flimsy.
B002N2JOJ6|5|Wound up not needing. Easy return.
B00429NKWK|4|as described
B006ZDXNK0|2|Not easy to make look right, I gave up and quit.
B001O43LNO|2|I purchased this item because it stated that it was a direct replacement for: pre-1984, 121-840 key codes. I have a 1978 Honda XL 125, key code 409 and it is the exact oposite of what I need so be careful when ordering. It seem like a good quality key, although a little large for a motorcycle. Shipping was fast and tracking information was sent as soon as it was shipped. We'll see about customer service but I have high hopes considering service so far.
B008W1NNDU|5|My all time favorite floor liners...  They fit perfect and catch anything that hits them.  The tread is deep enough to catch liquids, but it's beveled toward the middle so it's not any higher where your feet actually touch.  Great R&D put into these, and if I ever had to replace mats in another vehicle I would get these.  I wish they made them for the mitsubishi that my wife and I own.
B006EGAIJ2|5|These ramps worked flawlessly when changing the oil in my 2000 Buick Century (cement driveway).  They also store well - I stand them-up together in a corner and they don't consume too much space. Only time will tell how well they hold-up to multiple uses and different vehicles but so far so good.
B0096PRFC6|5|repels water great on ragtop
B000CEZTFK|5|This product offered by Amazon is an Ourstanding Price. Three to Four times less than the dealer and national service centers and its a BOSCH with a \\"LIFETIME\\" Warranty.  I already had to replace 2 OEM fuel pumps from Motorcraft/Ford doing a rebranding of a lessor quality product from the dealer at around $900 with \\"NO\\" warranty commitments??  Product working fine now for over 5 months without any signs of problems. I would have to say at this point I would highly recommend this Item.
B000GTY5R4|1|Got the part today and its the right sprocket but not the \\"Ultralight\\" version shown as the product picture. It doesn't have the six large holes in it. I seriously don't feel like having the hassle of sending it back so I'm just settling for the heavy one. Not cool guys.
B000JK2CF2|4|The unit arrived sooner than expected.  It appears to be of good quality.  It only took me 45 minutes from start to finish to install it on my 2006 Corvette.  I installed it right out of the box with minimum assembly required.  I only needed a 1/4\\" ratchet with an 8mm socket to install it.  If you are not mechanically inclined, you can install this unit without a problem.  My wife was watching as I installed it, and she stated \\"Wow! even I can install this thing,\\" and she can't even connect a charger on a battery. I experienced a bit more power and if my mileage improves as the manufacturer claims, that would be a plus.  This unit is not cheap, but I believe I made a good purchase.  I definitely recommend it.
B00HE6GI2M|5|They were as advertised. Get here on time. Very pleased.
B0002RNQBQ|5|Wow, good product. Thanks you Amazone, fit verry good, your my car Chevrolet Cruze LTZ RS. Thanks you Amazone.One client satisfait.
B005F5RD2S|5|Arrived just as described. Perfect accent to a custom hood scoop I'd just built for my Hummer H2..
B0009JKI6I|5|Very good
B000H0QQB0|4|Nice product
B000Z0HVHA|5|Will use this with the rotating emergency lights I bought for my technicians to use on their trucks.  Will give them extra length needed to place lights on top of truck cab.
B0083W16SM|5|Easy installation and didn't have to many any adjustments to jets or idle! Wish it would have came with the fuel and vacuum hoses but can't beat it for the price!
B00GKTZAHS|5|Prompt delivery. good price..
B00065ZIJ2|4|The reason I chose a4 star rating was because it is a little cheap but it will do the job. The truck club that I did have and gave to my son was far more superior.STOUT 572
B000BZJB7M|5|Vintage application for VW van , I save at least a hundred dollars on this purchase , thanks !<br />The fuel pump fit as original equipment (identical) and solved the problem in minutes. Thanks for being there Amazon !
B000B6AF80|5|The paint kit is pretty easy to use. I trusted the reviews about the paint brush that comes with the kit and got my own. Instead of using sandpaper to scrape away the break/road scum off the calipers, I used wire/copper brushes, and these seemed to work pretty well. I started working on this project at 9AM and finished around 6PM, so it can be a lot of work if you put good effort into it. My painting skills are not so great, so the paint on the rear calipers is a bit blotchy but I learned my lesson and did better on the front. The key is to make sure you use thin coats, and the paint dries fast when applied so just wait until the next coat to fix any mistakes or else you'll make it look worse. I applied 3 coats to all 4 calipers and had more than half of the paint left in the can, so no need to worry about running out of paint.<br /><br />If you're lazy like me and don't want to put in the work to spray-paint, then I recommend this product. I painted my calipers a couple weeks ago and so far they still look great. I don't know for sure about the quality of the paint over time, nor do I have high hopes, but time will tell. Enjoy!
B00WYSWHSE|5|Good
B00B6DGCOS|5|Works well, easy swap
B0010GMAX8|5|was told that it was the cause for the shaking engine at idle, turns out it was the large engine mount on the passenger side!<br />replacing the idle control changed nothing...but at least it is new...i gave it 5 stars because it works fine (just like the original)
B009WEBEA0|5|Works just as good as the one on my other bike. Great !!!
B00HR5PTRA|5|Well built and heavy and the color matches my Jeep perfectly.
B00EYZUNJ0|5|works great!
B00282YGA8|1|'09 GMC Acadia - This blade is too long. It strikes the overhang above the rear window and gets stuck. IT DOES NOT FIT, SO DO NOT BUY IT!
B000N9LX2W|5|The tail lights arrived in expected condition. They fit my car perfectly, look superb and came at a great price. I would recommend this to all 2004 Jeep WJ owners. They came with bulb sockets and wire adapters,it was easy to install. The lights have been working properly on my 04' Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo CRD 2.7 (Europe edition).
B009KAQGEU|3|This product was not a OEM product.  It also did not come with a template like the OEM products that you can purchase.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I had a pair of VERY expensive shoes that I loved with a stain on them from something I spilled. After keeping them for several years I decided they needed to be trashed because they were unwearable, no matter how expensive or loved! It occurred to me to give it a shot to clean them, even though the stain was bad. This product worked so well I did shoes and bags for hours and was THRILLED. It is awesome stuff!!!
B000COPDHY|3|Cheap, lightweight plastic, but it does the job.
B0012BL8LG|1|crap, It can't even drive a 2 amp air pump, zero star if there is such.
B000EQW2D8|5|This filter is a perfect fit for my 2009 Honda Ridgeline.  Fits perfectly.  Yes, I will order this again .
B0040FOWDM|1|Sensor wire lead orientation was positioned forward instead of leading toward the rear of the car.  My application was a 99 528i. Oh well, another item for my upcoming garage sale.
B000CLJOLI|5|It fit and worked
B00029J3C0|5|I tried several other more expensive mufflers and these were by far the best sounding, and not too loud, for my application.
B001QIYAQ0|1|Hi i just but this machine to scan m'y air bag light it on.The scaner have à code but it no information what is the probleme not info for the code .it show thaï i have to connect to innova compagnie .from innova also can not help they sai i have go see a dealer for More info.<br /><br />My whatever i light to sold my problème m'y self  That why i buy this scan for my the compagnie show More détail<br />So it not good for me this scan innova 3150.
B001U7FTRG|5|Got them today for our fifth wheel. They look very well made. Time will tell?
B00LHJ2GU0|5|Just got it on the home look and perfect fit to stick in my car.
B000C53RC6|4|So far so good.  Ease to install and are a huge improvement over the worn out originals.
B00JA80PEO|4|This headset, in my opinion, is a great deal for the price. I think it is built well, the audio is decent, and the install is pretty simple.<br /><br />I have a scorpion exo 500, and the speakers for the headset are just a BIT too big to fit into the indents on the helmet, it works though, and if you wanted to trim the inside hard foam a bit, it would fit in nicely. I didn't trim because I didn't know the quality of the headset, and thought if it was horrible I could replae it with a SENA or something with the hopes that the headphones would fit in those indents. Other than that, the install went smooth, it feels solid on the helmet.<br /><br />Operation is pretty straight forward. I use an Android phone (nexus5) and it works great with google now and all the voice commands. It can answer and end calls, skip the song, go back to the previous song, volume up, volume down. I'm not sure if it can pair with other headsets, and haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Sound quality is decent, I have had a few crackly sounds, but over all its fine. I was able to answer and have a conversation on the freeway at about 70MPH. It was a little hard to hear, but I think it was just because my volume was a bit low, and didnt want to fiddle with turning it up.<br /><br />Overall, for the price you can't go wrong.
B0052FRT2A|2|In a pinch with low funds sure...this is a decent deal and you have to pay to get them put on if you're not handy...but two of them broke again after several months...luckily due to package deal I had two more...but then...I used those too...lol The mechanic advised me I would get what I paid for and unless I wanted to be back again, order a better quality if I wanted to get them myself lol
B002KJQCFQ|5|Good quality for being an aftermarket part. Looks better than the original. Very reasonable pricing. The original part costs twice as much.
B0057B61K0|1|I bought this for a 1997 Saturn SC1 and from the description it was supposed to be a direct replacement. It does not line up correctly at the door seal and leaves a gap. Also it's a different style mirror than the drivers side.
B004L2XHMG|4|worked as described, the installment was much more work than advertised as you have to take the inside quarter panels apart.  please test your lights before putting back together. if upside down but connects you will not get a blinker or light to work.
B0052FRQPK|4|I was impressed on how quick the part arrived.  The part was a very good item to purchase for the money.
B00CH6T18C|5|Perfect... but I wish there was some kind of protectorant... still, it cleans beautifully!
B00CU8ZS48|5|Works great
B004VJCC52|5|Great
B004OHFQCW|5|Very tough and a good fit around the trailer bar.
B00PLLEG1C|5|great job
B00L4GHCYG|5|Looks great
B0026E3ZB4|5|This HID is incredible!!!  The installation took like 20 min and everything went just flawless.  I am happier than ever with my lights. I've had a few brands before but wasn't happy enough until I got this piece of equipment.
B000HBGJG6|4|I purchased this item for my new elliptical and it works great and keeps the wear and tear to a minimum
B001F2I7SE|5|This vent cover is great. A lot of air moves out. The only time rain gets in is when it is going sideways.
B0009IBJAS|5|Does exactly what its supposed to do. Charges my motorcycle battery and switches to float automatically when its done. Satisfied 100%
B0030YWM0Y|2|When I purchased these super tones I made sure they were &#34;NEW&#34; instead the product came in in a manner which I could clearly see that it had been tampered with. The Philip screws on the outside were clearly removed at one point and once put back destroyed.
B00PJO0JFI|5|Great product, no dust, pliable and lays out nicely
B002TV7WHM|1|Not a well produced product. The outside mounting tabs for the lights were off-center by .5 inches. The distance from the center mounting tabs to the otter tabs was off by 1 inch on the right and 1.5 inches on the left. The frame mounts from the bar itself were 1.25 inches too wide. When all mounting bolts were torque down the bar twisted and sat off center.<br /><br />If I could give 0-stars on this I would. What a disappointment.<br /><br />The return was fast and easy
B008BMQYGI|5|The license plate cover was amazing my daughter got this for graduating she is already thinking of getting a paint job and this set everything up nice
B00030DLEE|4|it's great but little small
B001G6F4DU|5|Came on time and work great
B007TG7HVS|5|easy quick install (less than a min), works as it should. installed a week ago (not sure about the durability)
B00HE680GO|4|Picked this up at autozone today for my 99 civic. The paint color was a good match, the pen tip though was pretty much useless especially if you're trying to use it on a vertical surface (door, bumper, ect.) That being said, if you've got a chip or crack that goes down to the primer, or metal, that you can see from 10 feet away, then this may be your solution. It will be obvious on close inspection that something's not right but at least you won't see it from your house anymore. Simply put, it will camouflage the scratch, but it's almost impossible to get a nice smooth finish/transition. If you want the scratch totally erased this product is not for you. All in all though for the price, I think it did a good job.
B001G7L2Y4|5|Fits perfectly and came with brass washer. Should be standard on verey vehicle. This would extend the mialage especiall for those that don't change their oil as they should.
B005CAISOS|2|Fairly easy to install and I like it.  We will see if it holds up, I've had it on for a month and so far it has.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Around 2-3 months after installing, it began to peel off and came off completely within a week after that.  I can't recommend this decal as a result.
B00BME27Z4|4|Its a perfect fit  Took less than 5 min in to install and it looks good and I would tell anyone if they need one this is good buy..
B003IS3HV0|5|I am totally pleased with the product.  I really wish I had taken before and after pictures cause they would've been used to promote the product.  I have black leather chairs for the kitchen table.  I only keep six at the table and store the other two in my finished basement.  One chair that was kept in the storage room was fine.  The other chair that sat in the \\"living\\" space turned white (we still can't figure out why it did that).<br /><br />After doing some internet searching, I came across the Leather Honey website and decided that this was probably the product that I needed to use.  After talking with my husband, he agreed and I purchased a pint. We followed the directions to use vinegar and water and wipe the mold off (at least we think it was mold) and let it dry completely.  The next night my husband applied the leather honey and the transformation was unbelievable.  We wiped it off after letting it sit for a night and it was beautiful.<br /><br />I was having Easter Sunday dinner at my house and really needed that extra chair.  Your product was a lifesaver.  When my family came over, I explained the story and the chair.  My sister-in-law couldn't believe it.  She has some leather furniture that I'm lending the product to her.<br /><br />I'm really glad I stumbled across this site and even more pleased with the end result.
B006DYBGW8|5|Perfect fit for my Dakota parking brake. They took the parking brake from not working at all to perfect working order
B000BO1HMK|5|I finally got to wash my car today and I must say that The Ultimate Guzzler Waffle Weave By Cobra performed excellently. It dried my four door sedan and at the end didn't feel much more than damp, although, you can feel the weight of the water its not too heavy. Sure, it seems pricey but so is going through several bath towels per year. This item leaves no lint and leaves the paint shining. Does really well on glass and brightwork too.
B000C9DINK|5|Worked just fine, and took just a couple minutes to replace (for skinny people, borrow someone's kid if need be.)
B00BQN5QRM|5|Easy to install, works great, saved me a bundle.
B0044XHW6O|5|Best license plate covers Ive ever owned.
B007PBPI68|5|Awesome lights. Just ordered more. I know it states as back up lights but I am using as small  daytime driving lights. Look great easy to install.
B001INN5HI|5|This looks great on my vehicle and have held up great.  I live in Florida so the sun and rain can be brutal but it has been on my car awhile and still look like new.
B004ZF4MW8|1|UPDATE!!!! I'VE HAD THESE LIGHTS FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW AND  UNFORTUNATELY I AM DROPPING THE RATING FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASON.EVERYTHING IN MY REVIEW BELLOW IS STILL ACCURATE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVING ME PROBLEMS. A FEW DAYS AFTER THEY WERE INSTALLED THEY LIGHTS STARTED FLICKERING AND WOULD MAKE MY DOOR LOCKS UNLOCK AND LOCK RANDOMLY. IT ALSO WOULD KEEP TURNING ON MY TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT ON & OFF AT THE SAME TIME. THIS WOULD ALL HAPPEN WHEN THE LIGHTS STARTED TO FLICKER. I ENDED UP CALLING KENSUN AND AFTER NOT HEARING BACK FROM THEM FOR OVER A WEEK I DECIDED TO GIVE THEM A CALL AGAIN, THEY GUY TRIED TO PLAY IT OFF AND TELL ME THAT I NEEDED TO GET THE WARNING CANCELER AND ANTI-FLICKER RELAY. I WAS HESITANT AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY ANYWAY. WELL A FEW DAYS LATER AFTER INSTALLING THE ANTI-FLICKER, IT GOT WORSE, I WAS COMING OUT OF A PARKING LOT AND MY TRUCK DASH WENT CRAZY! DOOR LOOKS WERE LOCKING AND UNLOCKING, TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT CAME ON AND WORST OF ALL I LOST POWER TO THE TRUCK WHICH HAD ME STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD! THAT WAS THE FINAL DRAW SO I DECIDED TO SWITCH BACK TO STOCK IMMEDIATELY. SINCE I'VE GONE BACK TO STOCK I HAVE NOT HAD THESE ISSUES ANY MORE. I WILL BE TRYING OUT DDM TUNNING HID LIGHTS NEXT SINCE THEY HAVE A LIFE TIME WARRANTY INSTEAD OF A 2 YEAR. I WAS AFRAID THAT EVENTUALLY IT WAS GOING TO FRY MY WIRING AND CAUSE A LOT OF HAVOC SO I'M SENDING THIS BACK. NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE AND THE PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE!!!!!<br /><br />These lights are awesome! I installed these on a 2009 Chevy Silverado and they were direct plug and play. They are very bright, much brighter than the Phillips diamond vision witch are rated at 5000k. I actually returned the Phillips because I couldn't see at night at all. In the photo (facing the truck), the left light is the Phillips diamond vision and the right light is the kensun 6000k 55w, you can see just how much brighter they are. The picture with me inside the truck shows the differen inside the cab(kensun hid left, diamond vision right). The reason I gave these a 4 star is because they were not packaged very good and there were no instructions on installing the H11's, since the color of the wiring was different then the instructions. I however did contact Kensun and someone answered right away and gave me instructions on the install. The fact that I did not have to drill holes or run any extra wiring is BIG +. Btw, they are just as bright as my high beams and I can't tell a big difference from when my high beams are on(silverados have separate lights for high/low). If u have a silverado and are contemplating between HID or regular bulbs because of the wiring, DONT! Just get these and you'll be happy u did.nside the cab(kensun hid left, diamond vision right).

B0061GQUS8|5|i bought it. it works. put it on car, my friends think i'm cool now. they just use me for drugs though
B000FW2NEY|5|this steering wheel cover added style, comfort and confidence to my ride
B008HXZHVY|5|This is a good decal that people have stopped me for.  I mounted on the back window of my Escape and it looks great.
B004JBW54A|4|Perfect fit and quality for my Volvo S80. This brand is known for high quality. My dad used to say &#34; You will get what you pay for&#34; and &#34; I am so broke I cannot afford to buy nothing but the best&#34;
B00EKPOG10|4|At least all work unlike the red ones.
B00KS5JJ4A|5|I am not a car cleaning addict. In fact, I am the opposite. I have a white car because it hides dirt. My wife drives a silver BMW X5 because it hides dirt.<br />BMW's are notorious for brake dust. I hadn't washed her car in months. Seriously.<br />The front, 20-inch wheels are silver, but you wouldn't know it - they appear black from the brake dust.<br />I have in the past used the standard stuff found at WalMart, Pepboys, etc. Scrub non-stop and mediocre results.<br />But Sonax is unbelievable. I mean, wow.<br />Here is what I did.<br />I bought two bottles and used 1 and 1/4 bottles for her 4 wheels.<br />I went to a local car wash to have a high pressure spray.<br />I sprayed the Sonax on one wheel. Set my iPhone timer for 4 minutes.<br />The wheel turns purple and smells funny.<br />At the 2-minute mark, I used a wheel brush to loosen the dust in the cracks.<br />At the 4-minute mark, I sprayed water on the wheel.<br />80% of the dust was gone. Wow.<br />I then did the other 3 wheels. Back ones were 100% clean, the other front one 80%.<br />So even though the directions say wheels must be clean and DRY, I sprayed more of the Sonax on the now-wet wheel and let it soak another 2 minutes.<br />Sprayed with water again.<br />90% clean.<br />Did the same again.<br />And now I had 4 100% clean wheels.<br /><br />I have never used a more effective wheel cleaner in my life. This stuff kicks a**.<br />I wish national retailers sold this stuff.<br />Only Amazon and select local vendors sell it. Check the Sonax website if you need it now locally and can't wait for Amazon delivery.
B00AVUF7YS|4|For the price these grips are great.  Laces are a bit weak and you might replace them with quality rawhide.  But compared to other leather grips at four times the cost, these are good.  The reason I bought them is because my hands sweat on the factory grips on my shadow and I don't like to wear gloves.  This cut down on having wet palms.
B000FW2MWW|5|Arrived on time and packed well.  Is a good tender cable but is not a perfect fit with Schumacher tender cables.  Will fit, just a small gap.
B009DJN4WK|3|part was not exact fit
B005I65DVM|5|Excellent
B000ZEON90|1|Having read the literature and specifications about this product, I said this is a no brainer.  I finally received it, un-packaged it, charged it and used it to backup my SUV to my boat. Not only did I loose the signal (from monitor to camera on ford expedition), it contained the poor resolution and color.  The worst thing is my wife caught me boxing this thing up to send back.
B00COYNZJ8|4|It's great.  The colors aren't as vibrant as you see in the photo, but still cool.
B000M8NX0E|4|It seems to be helping with my stuck valve lifter. Thanks CRC and Amazon.
B000RN2AHQ|5|excellent
B002UJAXBU|1|Description and picture does not match the decal.
B000BYB2K2|4|Great wipers!
B002FDGWRA|5|excellent
B00L6J0B12|1|Did not fit :(
B000HACYNY|5|Good quality and speedy delivery. Can't ask for much more. This will do the job it is intended for very nicely. It is not a cheaply made product. Strong and sturdy.
B008A3SOC0|5|I got this for the front of my ruby red Ford Escape. It arrived quickly as usual with Amazon. I had been searching for a unique Texas tag license plate, I didn't want a shiny bright one. This plate is antique looking in that the colors are muted and appear faded. Very classy, I think. Even though I now live in Florida, I can show my Texas pride!
B00MJ40XGG|5|Absolutely  Awsome......made very well, fit my 2000 jeep perfectly. Thankyou.
B001FCK4TO|4|Looks awesome! Took a few hours to install, but it was worth it. Had to trim the skid plate to make it fit. Tons of compliments already. Changes the whole look of the truck.
B007HNYTZU|5|I have a dark colored car and this works perfectly during night driving. As for during the day, I would suggest a non reflective one. But this product is very good and highly suggest it.
B00COYNZJ8|3|This sunshade was absolutely AMAZING for the first three months. Then summer came to Florida and within a month of the sun beating down on it, it started to flake off and come apart. Perhaps if you don't live in a sub-tropical zone, you can consider this a real investment, but if a sunshade doesn't hold up in the sun I kinda feel like it's not doing it's purpose.<br /><br />That's no sunshade. It's a paint flaker.
B0002MB80C|5|I've had a lot of imitation leatherish wheel covers that a) smell and b) don't last very long.  I can't swear that this is real leather or not, but it doesn't stink like others that I've had, and so far, in about the 4 months I've had it, it's holding up well.  So far so good.
B006ZN3Z6W|4|Looks so cute
B00NHIHP3C|3|Installation is way more difficult than I expected.  The holes don't match up to any on the pedals.
B0031I1WKK|1|Amazon description states the following, but there are no details on 2yr roadside assistance & no toll-free support hotline as stated.  30 day return policy does not coincide w\ Amazon's description.

B00FQU70YS|5|Very bright! They work great on my ATV.
B003HFYZLK|5|This sunshade is well made and a perfect fit for the Honda Fit. It seems to be well made.  There are no gaps and locks behind the sun visors.
B00FH2ES7W|5|Thanks
B000F6DNMQ|5|Best thing I ever bought to help park in the garage without having to get out of the car to see if I am in far enough that the second car headroom.
B000AURZ08|5|Very cost effective and quick delivery
B004YA50M0|5|After owning 8 helmets I can safely say the GMax GM54S Modular Street Helmet is by far the best I have ever used. The built in sun visor is a leap forward in design and there are NO whisltes. I was riding at 85MPH with nary a hint of a whistle. Its very comfortable and at this price I am surprised I dont see more of them on the road.
B000VKTULY|3|Well you get what you pay for and this is inexpensive. It doesn't hold its shape very well but it does fit and works I assume. Next time I will spend a little more and get one of better quality though.
B008CE0R5E|5|Works great, doesn't slip.
B001G6T5B2|4|Perfect for what I needed. The only bad thing was that  the shipping cost was way more than the cost of the item.
B00K616TSA|4|These worked great in stock housing headlights of my 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse.  These come with 3 LEDs.  2 run as low beams and the 3rd comes on as high beams.  The 2 beams were a little brighter than stock bulbs.  I actually wired up the 3rd LED to stay on with my low beams as I never use high beams and they are much brighter now.  I'm happy with how the illuminate the roadway and I never get flashed by on coming traffic.  With all 3 LEDs on they are an improvement over stock bulbs.
B008LQSPKW|5|just what I needed ,at a great price thank you
B000C7YJY4|5|works great in my 1998 Saturn sl2
B005TTZQ8I|5|A great way to keep the body centered on the frame, and the Johnnie joint takes some of the stress off the brackets.  A lifted Jeep needs an adjustment to center the body. This is usually done by adding  another bracket to the lower track bar bracket.  With this you can dial it in precisely, and take some of the stress off both the mounting brackets.
B003ZWE8QW|3|The plastic 'chrome' wrinkled after a few weeks but has not come off after over a year of being on the car.
B0045XRK06|5|Very bright stick using SMD LED's.<br /><br />I've purchased several different brands of USB LED Light sticks, this is the first one that hasn't dimmed as it has aged.
B008535CTS|5|good product for the money, fits perfect. i'll buy it again in the future if needed for my pontoon boat.
B000GAOT88|5|Been on my ride for some eight years and still working like the day I got it! Has hardly got a scratch and all I do is clean out the light coverings. WELL MADE!
B0046AOV8M|5|Put the cup caddy in the RV.
B001SGR3BO|4|Pads went in the caliper well and have performed without any problems. No squeaks. They also provide a pack of silicone paste.
B007PLZGO2|5|At least now they'll know they're annoying.  The only thing better would be if I could go up to every minivan and smack them for each kid they have.
B001KOMQYI|5|Great item
B00412YT8W|5|My package arrived earlier than expected, Pleased with the product that I purchased, my window was fixed with the part purchased and I haven't had any issues since the new part was installed.
B00032K4BU|1|\\"Description reads 'frame made of die cast zinc'....I received frames made of flimsy plastic.\\"<br /><br />Same here.  I checked the model number to make sure.<br /><br />If Amazon is going to sell this junk directly to their customers,<br />Shouldn't Amazon read the description, and then inspect the product?<br />Or, is it more cost effective to refund and pay shipping both ways?
B00IQMR47Q|5|They are great! It isn't just I love Las Vegas, it is my &#34;Happy Place&#34;.. Never seen one like this. They were sent very fast. No problem
B000VAZ0N6|1|I've purchased automobile parts from Amazon before and never had any trouble.  This time, however, I was sadly disappointed.  The item arrived perfectly packaged, but when we pulled it out, we realized it didn't fit our Jeep.  When I bought it, Amazon stated it would fit my vehicle, but it didn't.  The label on the box matched the item that I ordered so there was no mistake there.  Did someone accidentally put the wrong item in the correct box?  Or was the mistake in stating that it would fit my vehicle?  Either way, I'm very grateful for Amazon's easy returns.
B003RWJ9I2|5|works fine same as original,for DYIers need to have original radio in car to setup I did not but radio on shelf in garage,reinstalled temporily,set remote,good to go
B005X4QCAA|5|I bought this for a friend of mine who keeps getting speeding tickets.  Her excuse, she couldn't see the speedometer.  So, I figured this would solve the problem.  It is extremely easy to install AFTER you get it to flip to mph (the instruction page is weak).  And yes it does work after simply plugging it into the cigarette lighter.  When you start out it takes a few minutes to start giving the speed, but after that it works GREAT.  So I bought another one for my Tracker.  I would give this prodcuct 6 stars if they allowed that.
B00684TIVE|5|Works fine, no complaints
B005VLCFLK|5|Perfect fit for my 2012 Honda Odyssey.
B001EKCFTO|4|Finish gun lays color and clear really nice,wish the primer gun had a 2.0 or 2.2 tip.<br />Great guns for the money,though.
B004BTOH5A|5|I would definitely recommend.
B000CNHS0U|5|Bought to use on 2004 Scion xB with Fram XX4967 filter with sure grip strip. This wrench is 67mm inside (Fram.com shows 2 5/8&#34;) and fits the filter with the grip strip. Took some doing to find the measurements and should be in the Amazon description. The product dimensions shown are useless  I have old wrench that is 65 mm and does not fit the filter with the sure grip strip. Very happy I bought this filter wrench as I do my oil changes and will continue to.
B00NWCM4UW|5|These are the best windshield wipers I've ever owned! They last longer in the FL sun and wipe my windshield so that I have no problems seeing in the rain. I highly recommend these blades to all!
B003XFZRXO|4|I received my product  and it is very durable and of good quality! I am pleased with my decision to order these nice plush floor mats for my daughters car. She also loved them!
B00FFL926W|5|AWESOME! IT WAS REALLY EASY TO INSTALL AND WAS FACTORY QUALITY OR BETTER. Amazon socks for putting a word minimum for reviews, but great product.
B0011O0YDW|4|No yellow logo - 2 thumbs up here.  If it had a Harley logo it would cost 3 times as much.  I like it.
B00K5UVSJC|5|Exactly what he wanted
B00H4CY9TK|5|no one had them. everyone looked at my car and smiled, every single time!
B004SCLP3C|5|Worked very nice. Easy install. They look like they belong. Much better then factory turn signals. Well worth the wait and cost.
B002YJHB8O|5|My OEM floor mats were totally worth the money. They fit great & keep my car floor in great condition.
B00T9SS9YS|5|My first 3/4 helmet. Built fair for price. Graphics are great. Bought a face shield to snap on at local bike store, overall very happy wiyh helmet.
B002FYBT0O|5|Yes, it is the right part.  I am pleased with my purchase. Thank you.  I will be ordering parts again.
B000BL10ZC|3|The 1993 Ford Taurus GL headlight assembly was well packed and arrived very quickly in good condition.  Lenses were very clear and OEM design.  The 9007 headlight bulb was included, but the turn-signal socket and bulb were not included.  Fit was fairly good, but the mounting studs did not come through the mounting holes far enough to install the retaining clips.  I thought about using the old mounting studs, but I was afraid of breaking something if I tried to take the new mounting studs off.  I filed down the plastic bases of the mounting studs to get them come through the mounting holes far enough.  This worked, but it took me about an hour.  Aim adjustment is controlled by 4 mm hex studs, same as OEM.  The Headlight assembly illuminates the road fairly well, but should spread the light more evenly.  I will leave these new TYC headlight assemblies on my car, but I am much more satisfied with the Eagle Eye assemblies I installed on a 1996 Toyota Camry.
B004JKX4X2|5|Bought this beginning if July and used it the next day. The 1000 trip went great and there was no rain so I could gauge the water tightness.  However, on the trip back,  we drove though driving rain and when we arrived, everything was dry.  We are very pleased with this product. Shipping was fast, very well constructed. Would recommend to anyone.
B00774U6HY|4|Fixed my window and is still working a year after installation.
B001O7PNXC|4|Great finishing Glaze and I liked the results I received with it.
B0015D4ZH0|5|For the money this can't be beat!  Haven't tried it with a heavy load but it works my snowplow nicely.  During install you have to cut into your factory wiring ignition wire which is kind of annoying, would rather you only had to do that if you wanted to but all in all very good.
B003179IFC|5|Easy to work with
B005NLQAHS|5|I purchased this scan tool to connect to the Torque app on my phone. Using an HTC One GPE on Android 4.4 I had no problem finding and connecting to this scan tool. Seems pretty solidly housed and fits into the port with no problems.
B00EK5EKO8|5|Pretty good quality headlights looks great in my f-150 Fx4 the chrome sure gives it more style and I got lots of compliment!!!
B008GMN66E|5|It was what we were looking for, and it did the job we needed done, my husband has got to were when he needs a tool or pretty much anything he will have me to me to check on amazon first, and I quote because<br />I'm sure they will have it, and the Prices' are always cheaper. THANKS.
B00651CLCS|5|Easy to install and looks good.  My standard antenna was hitting the windshield frame and nicking the paint and this antenna doesn't.  Can't report accurately on reception quality since I primarily use SiriusXM.  After installing the AntennaX I did try the radio reception in the driveway and around town and it seemed to work ok.
B00514ALI6|5|These mirror extenders are designed well and solved the problem of only being able to see my shoulders in my 2002 VRod
B001DRLBIY|5|This fits my 1997 Pontiac Sunfire very well and they have improved my braking performance dramatically (although I replaced the shoes as well).  I almost gave this 4 stars because one of these cylinders I bought had interfered with the wheel hub but I did a few passes over the surface with the grinder and it fit perfect.
B003CGH13S|5|I ordered this and thinking it was the lowest price to expect some pretty lousy stuff,  but it sits in the garage most of the time, so I didn't need much.<br />I was very surprised to find a good fitting top, heavy, good windows and tint.  It would recommend this to anyone.
B000ALBZEE|4|It works with very small scratches.
B0075D24M2|1|Did not fit with passenger seat, pushes rider to far forward, and pad was hard as a rock.
B0024E6QX0|4|blocks the light so my 3 year old doesn't feel the need to get up early.  When its to hot and we don't want to open the vents it keeps the heat out surprisingly well  good fit except for the vent handle but stays in place throughout the night.  Not sure how it works while driving down the road.
B003GMMV5G|5|Exclent product
B00CTVQ1UQ|2|I was unimpressed with this item.  Material quality was poor on the seat covers.  It's not worth the price paid.
B000WJYY24|5|When you buy this, make sure you have all the steps!!! It takes about 2 hours to line the whole tank well and even, make sure not to let the Kreem puddle up on any given side!
B00B5X8KIA|5|Very Happy Customer:<br />Will at Import Parts Depot replaced my faulty Blower Regulator within 24 hours - I am very impressed with their customer service and honesty! I will use Import Parts Depot on all further purchases for my BMW.  Thanks Will..!!!
B002E53R8Q|5|excellent product at very good price, I very happy.
B00002N57X|5|This was exactly what I was looking for to replace my old attic vent motor.boo
B0000AY1W1|5|Really looks good after an application and keeps dirt off indefinitely.  I don't care for the &#34;slick&#34; feeling on your fingers after touching the cleaned area but... better than the Armorall feel.
B002SC6R0A|5|This was a perfect replacement for the starter on my Honda TRX-450. Works great, great price. Thanks for a good product!
B007HOGFT2|5|Love th lock!!
B00DSD74S2|5|Very happy thanks
B0014E3MSS|5|This fit perfectly and was easily installed.  It replaced a much shorter connector and made tank changes easier.  Would buy again.
B00BE25GYS|5|This product delivers best spark so idle and starting is at it's best.  Fuel economy seems good as well.  They are expensive but<br />I imagine this is because few are sold compared to conventional spark plugs.  Used to think I needed a 'kicker' (back-up motor)<br />to be sure I would get back to the dock.  Now I know the darn thing will start right up.
B000XBIGCU|3|When some of my orders were delayed in delivery, I had to visit my local West Marine Store for some needed items (delayed from Amazon).<br /><br />I was quite surprised to learn that Amazon had charged me from 27% to 53% higher prices than normal (not on sale) prices at West Marine...<br /><br />The NGK BR8HS-10 was $2.99 at West Marine and I had paid $3.81 for exact same plug (three of them) on Amazon.<br /><br />I guess it's just like WalMart, Sam's or Costco in that not all prices are good deals.
B0009IQXFO|5|Best car wash I ever used.
B00230OCGS|1|This lock is visually appealing, but it is not very functional.  I returned it because the screws to fasten the lock to the frame would only go in about half way, and then stop.  This made it impossible to seat the lock against the frame, leaving it dangling (and useless).  Furthermore, the screws are designed to only screw them in, which made it very difficult to remove them, once I found out the installation could not be completed.  I decided to go with another lock with better quality control (although 3 times the price). If you can get one that installs correctly, it is a visually attractive lock.
B0006301QE|4|good as advertised
B0077CFPTU|5|Literally as easy to install as plugging a lamp. Throttle stop was a bit more annoying but i would suggest removing the header and working from the right side of the bike. Really opens up the throttle and the response, makes starting a whole lot easier.
B0072UQ0J6|2|These looked great at first, but within 8 months the paint is peeling off and the bars are rusting. These being the most expensive side steps I've ever bought and with the reputation of NFAB I was expecting a lot more. Very disappointing to see these rusting on the sides of my otherwise new looking 2014 Tacoma.
B00453TEKK|3|This is the second time I have ordered something sold by LEDwholesalers only to get 1/2 or close to that of my order screwed up.  The Item I received is in a bag with the correct description, but contains a totally different part (I got this \\"[[ASIN:B002UCL2IA Dome Light T10 194 Wedge Base Rear Plug 12V 6 5050 SMD LED White, 1428WH]]\\" based on the picture on amazon).  Since the part is only $14 and I can rewire these for other uses I may keep them, BUT BEWARE you may not get what you ordered.  I was hoping since this was \\"fulfilled by Amazon\\" I would not get these errors, but since the packaging had the correct part number it was not Amazon's fault.  When I challenged the vendor on the first error all I got after 3 emails (the phone and mail do not work) was \\"You order has nine items and is complete\\"  Might have been a language issue, but.....  Sorry, but had to select a rating, I am sure the correct product would be just fine.  All of my other purchases from LEDwholesalers worked fine, just the wrong parts.
B0012Q9ZSO|5|Recently I put a set of four of these plugs into my 2005 Toyota Corolla LE, and saw positive results immediately. My Corolla has idled consistently at 750 rpm since I bought it nine years ago. The only changes made were installing the set of new plugs, and a new serpentine belt. So, I feel it reasonable to attribute the fact that the car now idles at 950 rpm (a 26% increase) to the new plugs. Having started sluggishly for a year or two (which I had chalked up its nine years of service), it now starts instantly like a new car. It also runs quieter (this might be the new serpentine belt), runs smoother, is more responsive and, I suspect, possibly more fuel efficiently as well. I will need to drive a few weeks before I can tell if the past nine years of a steady 30-32 mpg gallon, has been affected one way or the other. I can say that it seems to take less pressure on the gas pedal to get the same results though, so I would be surprised if mpg were not improved to some degree at least.
B0002SA4K6|5|fits great and built well may get another for other side little pricey but you get what you pay for would reccomend
B007CVSBL0|5|:)
B00SSKUHAC|5|Fits great and serves its purpose.
B000V8VZ78|5|Worked very well on my old BMW leather seats.
B00O29SZ8E|5|Awesome bottle perfect size and it has already gotten me out of a tight spot where I almost ran out of gas. The seal is real good and doesn't leak or smell of gasoline. The opening is big enough for a fuel pump spout to fit in in case you were wondering. good thick walls so don't worry about dropping it. The skeleton design on it is pretty cool.
B000C5UFW6|1|As costly as this product was I am very disappointed that it stopped working within two days of being installed. I feel I should get my money back and I warn those looking around to find a better quality product. I wish I had a good recommendation but I can only steer you away from this one!
B003A8D6YG|2|This thing is so sticky it damaged one of my ID cards that I set on it for a couple minutes.<br /><br />If you want a grip pad that will keep your phone in place when you're upside down this should do it.<br /><br />I ended up removing it because it was *too* strong since I wanted it for holding ID cards but it was actually pulling the plastic coating off of them. When I pulled it free of my dash it took some of the shine off with it; you can clearly see where this had been sitting.<br /><br />I wouldn't use it again but I could see how it might work well for others. Just be sure you don't plan on moving or removing it once it's in place.
B00OLF0IX4|5|Looks great. Didn't actually decal it to my car.
B0075FU38W|5|The hardest part of using this key was convincing the guy at the hardware store to cut it. He didn't wan't to ruin my &#34;expensive&#34; key. When I told him how little I paid for it and that I was willing to take the chance he cut it. Transferring the electronics over was a breeze and now I have a replacement key at a fraction of the dealer price.
B00MC7O9MO|5|WORKED
B0091DJXV4|5|went inside of a car door and in the engine to see the pistons, works good. I would buy again.
B002P8HIPU|2|As it have been said, manual remote does not fit the ribbon cap on 2nd generation ford focus (1st is probably fine).  The reflective part vibrates a lot (which is quite annoying) and slowly slides down, so you have to readjust it from time to time. Anyway, it is something you expect from 20$ mirror.
B001G8AIMU|5|Great product
B009V071PW|5|Highly recommend.  Wouldn't have anything else on my bike.
B000FQ02PC|3|Bolt holes did not line up other than that great looking product. Off by only a few cm but couldn't be used
B0061J6HFQ|3|No alumbran
B00NXG5OOK|5|Good price delivered promptly fit well
B0066QRAU0|4|When done all is good. Had to install slightly differently then instructions said. But its in and works perfectly. This was on a 2000 volvo c70 conv.
B0034KU88C|5|excellent low cost way to add both power and fuel economy to our jeep which was a total dog before
B003UROIVW|5|Purchased to replace valve stems not put back on car...love the different look it gives my Infinity truck.  Would purchase again without a doubt.
B00N2BSC54|1|Very disappointed.  This product was highly mis advertised. I will not order again.
B00IY2BAZ0|5|Arrived quickly and just as described.
B00BFEGBKI|4|Guess I didn't read the ad well enough. These are motorcycle jerseys, not bicycle. I found the looser cut very comfortable and they look great, but I do miss the pockets. The colors and graphics are great.
B008T8CXGY|4|just thought i would try it out on my trailblazer to protect the bottom of the doors from rusting that will take some time to tell
B000EDOSS8|5|These worked very well on on fifth wheel trailer.
B005EMBSTQ|4|Beware of adding leak sealer, I added some and pretty sure I sealed off the recharge port from the compressor... oops. Oh well, sold that car so another problem for another mechanic.
B000AS1XYO|5|What up? My name is Ernesto Antonio and about my purchase of lucas oil stabilizer was good, get on time and the product is realy good to keep the motor of my eagle talon 96 on very good condition. Thanks.
B00AX9E3OC|5|Its the best polish I ever used,it gives the vehicle and deep shine and my car is a 2007 and its  black it looks like a new car.It will take out all the swirls marks and the more you use it the deeper the shine just use as directed and you will get great results.
B000GZK7HA|4|nice pump for the price
B00029WYVW|3|Have not use yet but am getting close (mileage). Will let you know around end of year. Bottles look nice and reviews seem favorable.<br />Had to put some stars or they(?) would not publish this review.
B00514BC7U|5|Amazing grips.  So much better then the other stock ones I had on.
B005BNP7YU|5|Looks great on the back of my truck, you can't see the brake and running light in the day time, but it really shows up good at night..that's ok, because I'd rather see the nice chrome finish in the day time.
B000HAEPSG|5|Works as intended!
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Excellent
B0081ZYYR6|5|nice soft material, does the job to seal up my rims during their off-season from the elements and keep them clean
B002G39FIC|5|Does just what it claims and looks great in my '62 Lotus
B0016C1Q22|5|great kit, bought it to tow a 5x8 uhaul trailer from Houston to NY, worked as expected. Ball mount design interlocking with the hitch is a plus.
B00BD5GYWO|5|great seat covers and customer service
B00BP5QMHO|5|This helmet is low key, and lightweight.  Did I mention lightweight???  I ordered the same size I normally use and the fit was great.  The helmet is used with a harley and very limited wind buffeting.  Also it reduces wind noise,  I highly recommend this Helmet
B00N48HC0Q|5|Worked perfect
B00HJCX05O|5|An easy way to save almost $500 over buying with a new Highlander
B0021ELWRI|4|I've had three sets of these glasses. Two are great, one lost its part of the rim holding a foam after two days. All in all, still recommended.
B007MNU116|1|Easy setup. Worked great for 2 months now is like scratch off lottery ticket right place right time it will work more than likely loses and doesn't. Pay more for a better one. These are scrapes and rejects that failed to make it so they are sold dirt cheap
B00BLYCZA2|3|Prongs are little short compared to the halogen bulbs, bass is wider makes it hard fit
B00DFUPLQK|5|arrived quickly and is a perfect match.  I've had aftermarket replacement parts before that just don't look right, but this one is perfect.
B00FRHOMNM|4|Good quality,  works fine.
B00B06PD6O|5|I have used this cover for several months now and absolutely love it! The convenience and look are exactly what I wanted.
B00JQQ7WGO|5|Very nice. Worth every penny. Good quality
B001G5VZGQ|5|The same as the manufacturer set I took off, which is what I asked for.  More brake dust than I'd like, but I wanted OEM and got it.    It was not a hard job to do at all . I didn't swap the rotors but I'm sure it's a good idea, i'm just too cheap. .   I bought brake anti-squeal compound at the same time and slathered that all over the place.  No more squeaks.  edit:  I forgot to mention these were stock on BMW 328i
B00KXB8EKE|5|The Best Tank you
B008I16EIU|5|Fit perfectly, and saved me the parts markup at my local auto repair shop.
B001C3XD0S|5|this is an easy fit for my bike, or any other bike. I can easily adjust it. It allows me to hold my morning coffee mug on my way to work!  woo-hoo!!
B00Q3JTSRI|5|It was a struggle to put on but.....Excellent because all the auto shops I went to...... no one carried 13.5 size.<br />And those that did... it was female oriented.
B002WHABJ4|1|I ordered a driver side regulator assy, but the replacement part that I received was a regulator for right rear side. It is much shoter than the unit that I removed from the car. So I had to remove motor and pulley out of it to make the driver side regulator.  I don't have time to get a RMA number and waiting a new part so I had what I can do it.    Regards,  Tae Om
B000JKJE7G|5|this fit my 91 olds cutlass ciera 3.3L fit fine and came in the mail every fast 3 weeks faster then JC Whitney would have!
B003IS3HV0|5|Great producted used on so many things!!!
B000VAZH5W|1|This part would not plug into my existing socket.
B0046PTOH0|5|Great
B003WGMHUK|4|Purchased these because I wanted a red colored towel and I've had good experience with their yellow 350 GSM towel so I figured this would be a no brainer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this 300GSM type is not nearly as good as the 350GSM.<br /><br />I use these towels for general interior and glass cleaning on my vehicles.
B001P11SCM|5|I chose this because Im only towing a travel trailer and it was perfect for that! I picked up the trailer yesterday and it worked even easier than I had expected.........
B00U2NHLTI|5|This product is spectacular. I have tried the 6000K version and the not for US market 2700K version that can be found in Japan. Me personally I like the 2700K version because I prefer my fog lights to emit a yellow light. Beam control is excellent and they produce no glare for oncoming vehicles. Awesome product!
B0054RAKD6|4|Works awesome.  I needed more parts and that's not really the companies fault it was my lack of knowledge but works awesome in AZ where it's sunny EVERY DAY.
B008HDXS1U|3|Appears to the naked eye to be about 40-60 % as bright as incandescent bulb. Color temperature is not very &#34;warm&#34; but I do not find them blue at all. They appear well made but overpriced. Should be brighter for the price.
B003YMG0GO|5|This is my 2nd MotoBatt in 2 different motorcycles and I'm very happy with them.  I put the first one in a Husky TE610 and now this one in a WR250R.  Some models of the Motobatt's have a 2nd set of terminals that make it great to hook up other electrical items.  This particular model doesn't, probably because its a smaller battery.  Even with that though, one of the best features of the MotoBatt's is their terminal setup.  They come with this brass fitting that gives a couple different mounting options to fit a wide range of hookups and since the brass fittings are self tapped, there is no messing around with those little nuts that you can never connect on most other batteries.  This also makes it easier to hook up accessories with this setup too.<br /><br />One of my biggest reasons for first trying the MotoBatt was the results of the &#34;Texas Toast Battery Cook-Off&#34;.  Google it and read the review.  The MotoBatt came out way ahead.
B003G0Q4RE|5|The floorliners install easily and fit exceptionally well. The underside small spikes keep them in place. Within a few days of installation they proved themselves as we were in Santa Fe NM and it snowed about 8 inches. They worked well and cleaned up easily. I would recommend.
B000BQP2VA|1|In order to use these, you have to cut them from the attached tab along the top of the floor mats - cutting actual floor mat material.  Once I did that and put them in the vehicle for which I ordered them, I quickly noticed they do not come close to fitting at all  I returned this item immediately and do not recommend.
B00IXZU2WU|5|Doing a complete timing repair and this tool really makes the job so easy
B00HY4Q022|5|Great I love it!
B00JU65OP6|5|Gave as a Christmas Gift to my Sister in Law, she is very happy seemed like the Sturdiest Design and perfectly fit her Vehicle Sunvisor while still providing access to her sliding Vanity Mirror, an excellent product and even better customer service and E-Mail Satisfaction and Guaruntee Followup.
B000E5W9P0|5|product came just as described and works great on my 2008 Honda Ridgeline all my vehicles have KN filters and I've never been disappointed
B001EF1SCO|1|I scraped the old gasket off and then used alcohol to clean off any residual adhesive.  Let the gasket set for two weeks.  The first time I used it the sauce pulled the gasket off the ceramic surface.  Maybe I'll try the nomex gasket next time.
B0045V8CKU|5|I was skeptical of this product since the price difference was so significant compared to the OEM Honda brand. This rack is exactly the same as what my local Honda dealer was offering at a third of the price. As for the installation process, it took me 30-45 minutes. The brackets are marked either left hand or right hand side of the vehicle and the bars are marked front or back. If you notice these markings the installation process is a breeze. Overall, very impressed.
B00IAXDEYS|4|What I wanted, although doesn't seem as sturdy as the Ming's Mark chairs.
B000C9OTY2|5|I bought this to install myself, however since my car needed additional service I had the mechanic install the belt.  Save me money by supplying my own parts.
B005XR026W|5|This was an great deal and I couldn't beat the quality of the item. Best key chain ever, fast delivery and wonderful service, I would recommend this to everyone.
B001UOPRS0|5|brief:  awesome stuff.  it actually works and can actually get out deep cigarette smells that have been baked into the cloth upholstery of a car for years.  but... your car will smell like chemically baby powder for at least a week.  after that, you'll have good, normal clean air/smell in your car.<br /><br />advice: &#34;what you get out (the result), depends on what you put in (labor and care invested).&#34;  this life saying is so true.  i bought a 4 year old used car.  days after i settle on the price with the dealer, i went to pick up the car.<br /><br />details: when i got to the lot, the car windows were all rolled down, and the sunroof wide open.  but, being this was only the 1st time i ever really bought a car solo, i suspected nothing.  drove the car home for an hour, no problem.<br /><br />days later, i finally figured out why the dealer rolled down all the windows... horrible smoke smell.<br /><br />so, i talked to some car friends and mechanics.  i was told that you can't get the smell out, have to spend hundreds and go for ozone cleaning, or a deep cleaning.<br /><br />bs, or they didn't know what they were talking about.<br /><br />i bought this 10 dollar can, took all mats out of car.  vacuumed EVERYthing and everywhere in my car.  wiped down everything with scented baby wipes; i used baby wipes because i was sure that was safer to use than chemicals like bleach or chlorox wipes.  then, i sprayed or &#34;fired&#34; this odor bomb everywhere: under the front seats, aimed at the head liner, into seat backs.  i raised, lowered, tilted, reclined front seats and still aimed everywhere that was exposed.  even pushed this stuff into the air vents (months later, no problems).<br />then, i shut the doors, windows.  stepped out, sprayed the bomb stuff one more time as i was outside the car with one door open.  then, just threw the can in the car, left it alone overnight.<br /><br />when i got up, the cigarette smell was gone... but there was an even worse smell.  my best description really is that it smelled like very strong chemicals... but like &#34;metallic baby powder&#34;.  i know this makes little sense... but that's what i really smelled like.<br /><br />yes, it did smell worse than the original cigarette smell.  might have been worse that even more potent cigars.<br /><br />so, for the next week, when i turned on the car, i put the ac on and turned off recirculate mode.  i wanted to get rid of the odor bomb smell so badly and quickly - so i wanted to draw in air from the outside.<br /><br />whenever i drove, i tried to drive with the windows open, sunroof open.  even when i parked overnight or for a days work fro 9 to 5, i left the rear windows a little open, and my sunroof tilted up.<br />secret might be to get a lot of air flow post bomb spraying.<br /><br />when i could i would even roll down all the windows and open all the doors.  wanted maximum wind and air flow to enter the car.<br /><br />about 1 week later, odor bomb and cigarette smell gone.... and i couldn't be happier with my neutral, clean, natural air clothe upholstery car.  would definitly buy again... and wouldn't have done much of anything differently.<br /><br />summary: I THINK THE TRICK is to vacuum and or wipe everything down with baby wipes, spray this odor bomb everywhere, close all windows, let the car sit overnight.... then air out as much as possible.
B00ATPTAX4|2|Not very good quality.
B0096YKR22|5|Looks great and well made. The font of the text matches the Jeep Cherokee font so it looks like it's made for my vehicle!
B005C5DL54|5|Straight out of the box and onto the bike.  All I needed was a little Permatex for the bolts and it's doing everything I ask of it so far.  Big trip in<br />October will be the acid test but so far--so good.
B00SLKS1CA|5|Great buy...!<br />And very inexpensive!
B0000AXTUY|5|Super little charger! I have a car I only drive during the spring and summer months. Fall and winter this charger keeps the battery in top shape..without worrying about overcharging! I bolted it down, near the battery. It just stays in the car! The charger has two colored LED's to let you know if it's charging or in \\"Float Mode\\", where it maintains a full charge. Shuts itself off when full charge is reached. Bottom line: It does exactly what it say's it does! Excellent product!
B000R3SNJU|3|This is a very nice scanner for OBD II compliant vehicles from 1996, and a small selection of OBD I vehicles.  Before buying this product you must consult the user's manual, available on the manufacturer's website, to make sure your 1995 and earlier vehicle is supported.  I had to return my purchase, because the communications protocol for the 1995 Avalon, an otherwise OBD II compliant vehicle, is not supported.  No one sells a consumer version of a scanner for the 1995 Toyota Avalon.
B0006O2RV0|1|It looks great in the pic.  But for some reason using it is a challenge.  It is sitting in a glove<br />compartment somewhere never to be used again.
B000R5BLW4|5|This works just amazing for ball joints not like the crap the other guys sell. Just what I needed for rusty ball joints
B007XUHXRS|5|If You need a starter for your 6.8L V10 don't go any further from what i can see this is exactly the same starter that you will be charged aproximately 140 for at the cheep discount auto parts stores in town - I installed this yesterday 5/4/15 to replace the factory starter in my 2002 that I got in September of 2001, and has just under 200,000 miles on. It has fired up great the 2 starts i have done so far, I will post updates.... My thought is that if this makes it even 3 1/2 years it will be well worth it. the factory motorcraft is over 214 dollars before tax, and made it just over 13 years. If you can afford to wait for delivery of this starter, then wait! you will be happy.... at least I am.
B001EOV492|5|Although I haven't used the hitch to haul anything yet, the ball mount and ball seem to be made of quality workmanship, and that it will serve its purpose. Packaging could be a bit more beefy...arrived in a box several times its size without any padding...premature paint chips from something other than its function.
B0012TZ04E|5|Exactly what you need when it's time to conceal your face!
B000M5ZXDM|5|When I received this I was pretty excited to open it up and piece it together. To start off, throw the instructions manual away. You do not need it. All you need are the actual parts. You only need ONE (1) screw for this unless you don't want to use the handle. The extra carbon brushes you should save as there are already a couple in the terminals. The speeds are fast but to polish up a car, I fluctuate between 1-3 level speeds. This is only because I am pretty picky about how I leave my cars polished. Good luck and I hope you all enjoy.
B0016HNOFY|4|perfect fit yes i would buy again and again great Qulity OEM replacement part for gm what more can you say it fit and work great
B000BZJ9Q0|5|I bought 4 of these to replace my old burnt out o2 sensors for my chevy blazer 96 s10 and boy I was I happy with the result and how easy they were install plus the quality was perfect. If anyone need help to install or anything I would be more then happy to answer questions. Thanks again for quick shipment and quality of product
B003PZ0HG4|5|A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  It does the job nicely and shielding the dash from the sun and heat.  I would buy another one.
B002OXDHG0|5|I got this for my lab who just passed. Love their decals. They make you feel good. Great company, fast delivery
B000VU56IA|5|Perfect fit, good quality, and looks good. Just rolled it out in my 2004 Chevy Silverado long bed and away we go...
B00F23BNUG|5|worked great, will buy more when needed.
B005O17IDM|5|It was very easy to put over my daughter's steering wheel, no tugging or pulling. She absolutely loves it!! It was one of her favorite Christmas gifts.
B0049Z8X4C|4|Seems nice, but the chain unscrews. I had to glue it in.
B00OGN8B7G|5|Fit was great
B000PAS2YG|4|It does the job its supposed to. Cant tell a difference either way from stock vs this. Would buy again.
B000FPXV5G|4|Installed on my '88 cherokee.  Not the best cupholders in the world, but it's better than nothing.  Works great when you're not moving, provides you a stable platform while you're driving (though you'll probably want to keep a hand on your cup), and serves well for miscellaneous crap (coins, etc.).  30 second installation.  The latch on my center console works just fine, contrary to other reviews.  I also think it adds a nice look to the center console area.  Bottom line:  worth the $10.
B002Q44YOG|5|My mechanic charged me $125 per coil when he replaced 2 of then. When my 99 Maxima started missing at idle again, I knew what the problem was and decided to replace the other 4 when I found this great price. The job is fairly simple and took about an hour. Buy some dielectric grease for the boots on these. While I was there I replaced the plugs and used anti-seize compund them.
B002M9XMNY|3|Good design but like others said the bolts are not good quality.  I twisted the heads off two of them.  They will rattle loose with in a few mile trip also.  You must go and purchase grade 8 bolts at the least and HAVE TO put washers and lock washers on to keep them in place.  Otherwise a solid unit that just needs a tiny bit more refining.  I am using this with a 14' enclosed trailer being pulled by a 2010 5.7 tundra.  Good product just have to buy better hardware.
B00EHIPQ1E|3|i plug it in and works love the color not as bright as my last 35w i had.. and i have a chevy silverado and the lights go on automatically everytime i turn the key but with these only on turns on or sometime both dont go on i even got pulled over on new years eve i thaught my lights were on but they werent idk whats wrong or who could help me!!!
B007LICL56|5|as much as I love these fasteners, they aren't quite long enough to secure the license frame on. we're still working on a work-around because I want to use them!
B0074OHCOC|4|Lots of newer cars have really sloped windshields and it is difficult to get the inside clean.  This tool helps.  recommend using it with Windex brand single use wipes.
B00RWLNDRC|5|Ridiculously bright.
B007ROUW2I|4|They work great in my daughters razor e300 scooter and a lot cheaper. All I had to do is cut the wires to the old batteries and solder the wires to the new batteries.
B004W5O5R8|5|item as described
B000182DXI|4|I'll give the product a 4 because it is a quality item and the instructions are very good.<br />However if you have a Ford with auto-locking hubs (in cab switch)using vacuum lines and want to retain that option you cant use this item.<br />This is strictly manual and you will need to get out of the car to do this. I wish that this item had stated this in the description because it now is costing me money to ship it back. Even after using the tool to see if it fits my vehicle it should have given a warning about vacuum lines.<br />If you dont care about getting out of the car to switch it into 4WD then these are good to get.
B0057TVU9Y|4|Looks great on car.
B005EUYQQK|4|Love it
B003JU71YG|5|My sisters camry which has 275k miles on it was shifting a tad hard. I added this and noticed the hard shifting became smooth instantly. A++++ Lucas.
B00JA3BMDW|4|Got it on sale, not something most people will ever need but it's still fun as a conservation piece or great gift for the science buff in your circle.
B005ESTV44|2|This is a poor quality replacement part. The mirror should mount flush to the door, but due to sloppy manufacturing, the plastic plate that holds the mounting bolts stuck out way too far from the base of the mirror, causing a gap of over 1/8\\" between the mirror and door frame when installed. That may not sound like a lot of gap, but that is much wider than the thickness of your car key - a lot of rain can get into a gap like that!<br />I thought about returning the mirror, but I had the door all apart and didn't want to wait another week for a replacement mirror that could very well be just as bad, so I installed the mirror and then used some black silicone to seal the wide gap. The casual observer probably won't notice the gap, but I do, and it is now one more thing that I have to periodically maintain on my car.<br />On top of all that, the first time I took the car out for a drive after installation, I noticed that the image on the new mirror was very distorted - not \\"closer than they appear\\" distorted, but wavy distorted; usable, but very annoying.<br />The only positive thing I can say is that the mirror's motors work, so I can adjust it remotely, and from a distance, it looks like a OEM mirror. I went for the lowest priced mirror, and I guess that I got what I paid for. Buyer beware.
B000XQ9MGE|4|This is a good jump start battery. I've used it twice so far to help friends. It charges fast and recharges fast.<br /><br />the only negative thing about this product is the small lamp that is useless.
B0043QURV4|3|Don't buy this for use on the Honda Insight (original 2000 model) oil drain. The threads do NOT match properly and you'll strip out the oil drain plug female threads if you try to install it. I didn't give it &#34;low stars&#34; because this is really MY fault. However, I won't accept all blame. In the forums, this part is listed as the right part to make an easy-to-use drain valve for the original Honda Insight. DON'T USE IT.
B0010XP880|1|I was excited to get this product because I love clear glass with no streaks.  When I received it, I used one wipe (they are very small) and there was basically no cleaner (moisture) in the wipe to do the job.  I think this is a very expensive product to clean glass, but was willing to pay the price if they worked.  They are not a good investment if you are looking for a great product to use on your mirrors and glass items.
B00379ABX2|1|The sign is a bit flimsy, but will do the job. My complaint is, they put a big Hy-Ko sticker with bar code on the face of this sign and the large sticker is impossible to peel off clean, so the message can't be completely see, therefore I can't use the sign...so annoying!  Don't know why they couldn't put their sticker on the back of the sign. Guess the lights are dim upstairs. I'll never buy from them again.
B003EAW57E|5|a great product and I would recommend it to everyone that has hard working boots
B001QVA7Y6|4|Amazon has fabulous prices on auto parts but really lousy labeling.  You have to go the manufacturer's website to identify front rotors:  these are the front rotors for a 2010 LR4
B001JTQSZ2|5|Radiator in my 2001 SL2 developed the \\"dreaded cracked tank\\" so at 215000 miles it was time. Buying the Delphi gave me a Made in the USA exact fit replacement which matched down to the markings the OEM one. Went in without a hitch. It's nice when a part \\"just works\\" out of the box. Amazon saved me lots of $$$$ and sent it quick. Customer service was as good as it gets.
B00KIDF9PK|5|It's good for a lightweight trailer.
B000E4Q4DE|3|These hubcaps don't really fit 2003 VW Passat factory rims.  The tabs are too long causing the hubcap to not sit flush and they are difficult to put on.  They do fit on my aftermarket snow tire rims.  Nice looking hubcaps.
B00BITJKPI|5|Great service and merchandise
B000CIPHUI|4|I have had a single station Battery Tender for years. I have used it every winter when I store my toys. I would switch between the lawn mower battery, the Harley battery and my Oldsmobile battery. PITA, my son wanted to put his Harley in my garage this year so I decided to buy the 4-Bank Battery Tender.<br /><br />It works great and hook up cold not be any easier. The only reason I will not give it 5 stars is the cables. The material the cables are made from do not like the cold. They are very stiff and will not stretch out and lie flat. My older &#34;Battery Tender Jr&#34; cable are much better.
B0047D2FWM|5|Love this jack! Used it for several months now and since it's a 3-ton capacity, it can lift my car fairly easily.  Very sturdy and it allows me to lower the car as slow as I want.  Much heavier than I thought but I only use it in my garage so weight doesn't matter much for me.  If I needed a jack to take to the track or something, then I'd prefer to get something lighter to save my back.
B006H7MM56|5|Great hat to keep in the car for those unexpected downpours.  You too can look like the Gorton Fisherman or his wife.
B008Y327R4|5|Great thanks
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Wow, these are bright! I used these to replace the dim little bulbs that Mazda uses in the MX-5 front parking lights, now they are bright enough to be DRLs. Not too blue, just crisp white. I can't imagine these as license plate lights, but they would make good backup lamps, if these are the right size for your bulb socket. If they last as long as LED lights should (years and years) I will be extremely satisfied.
B001KS2PYK|5|one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty
B00QIJOD2S|5|Amazing looking lights! Better than many others i have tried. ...it really is water proof! Nice blue tint...similar to 8k hid
B002X6DQUA|4|The only thing wrong with this ccessory, is that apparently, they are too easy to steal! Some jackleg stole my original, and I'm now on the repalcement
B003PII7MC|5|Very high quality, albeit lightweight hitch for my Mazda 626.  Installlation took considerably longer than that estimated.  Worht the extra time given  the result.
B00EK5B3K2|5|Better than I expected great product great price and on time delivery would recommend to all my friends
B0034FFJIQ|4|My son's grandfather gave him his 4 wheeler to fix but it was missing the repair manual. This worked great.
B000RU68SQ|5|These are great shocks, worth the extra compare to others.<br /><br />One critical note: Amazon's description (stating that two are included) is incorrect.  Only one shock is included.
B002JI8RHO|1|THESE ARE MADE FOR CHINAMEN, NOT AMERICANS
B00E5OUOCQ|5|It fits really well with my car and keeps the car cooler when parked under the sun.
B00NJ903MY|5|These look great on my car a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix, throw out even more light than expected. The led lights look great on my car and the seller is s pleasure to deal with will buy from them again
B000CLSN1K|5|Just as described & fits perfectly on described vehicle.
B006FKTR30|5|Very nice set of valve covers, a fraction of the price I have found elsewhere ! Fast shipping too.
B00BD9HYJW|4|good, but i need to clue some parts...
B0049DUJ4G|5|excellent shape!
B000RXKR6M|5|I purchased this item as a gift, so it hasnt been used yet. However, you can tell that it is an excellent wash mitt. It is very soft & thick. I will definitely purchase this brand again!
B001GAVGX8|2|My glasses fog up quickly while riding with this on. Plus it is very uncomfortable to turn my head while wearing this. Would be fine if you were riding your motorcycle in a straight line, never stopping, and never turning your head to look for traffic... I hate full face helmets but I'd rather wear one to ride in the cold than wear this thing.
B009UNQ5NY|5|Daughter wears it everywhere. She loves it.
B00GHT4JFA|5|This product is awesome!!  Highly recommend it,  relatively easy to install and looks just like the original stock center console for a much more economical price!!  ☆☆☆☆☆ 5 Big Stars!!!
B0040D2OFW|5|Works great at a reasonable price.
B000O0AYMK|5|fast shipping great item description
B00FADIZYA|5|They work just as good as the factory wipers!!
B00NGQK9YW|4|Product is made of quality materials.  Rated at 4 starts due to the construction design.  Phone pocket is great, fits a Samsung Galaxy S3 with some room to spare, and has a hole for a 12v/USB power cord or headphones.  The cargo pocket is hinged on the side, and not the bottom.  Due to this, you have the risk of things falling out when you open it.  It would be better if it was hinged at the bottom versus the side.  Also, it only has one fastener for the zipper, two would have been better, especially since it is hinged at the side.
B000XRX372|1|THE PRODUCT ARRIVED WITHOUT ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS.    CONTACTED SUPPLIER, INSTUCTIONS WERE PROMISED, BUT NEVER DELLIVERED
B000H01JQ2|5|Best Harley manual out there for less money
B004C6K9H2|4|Nice quality leather, nice craftsman ship.  Long heavy duty chain with key ring.  Zipper pockets inside could be a little better.
B000MIWLXY|5|This is a good tire tool.  Would recommend this to anyone who wants to get serious with a tire.  If you've struggle with spoons or screwdrivers or even a big bar, this is what you should have been using that whole time.
B002R10DJ8|5|I am very satisfied with this product. Joseph S.
B003CG9QFY|5|Great product, but if you don't want to drill on the rear gate, I recommend using a self adhesive  2&#34; Velcro. I used it and it holds perfectly. And no drilling!!
B00CAVTD3W|5|great product
B003NI1H6W|4|Product arrived on time and was exactly correct for my vehicle.  Installed easily and works great.<br /><br />Only complaint was the instructions.  Clearly they wrote one set of instructions for every possible type of installation.  Therefore the instructions were complicated, difficult to understand and almost enough to make me fearful of the installation project.  Never should have looked at the instructions.  Installation was a snap.
B00RKGCSMK|5|Fantastic quality.  Sturdy, comfortable, and top notch durability.  It even breathes great on super hot days so you don't pass out waiting at a traffic light.  Conceal pocked only has a strap for right handed shooters, but it's far from the end of the world.  I'm a lefty and this is the best vest I've ever owned. Would definitely buy again.
B0002JM8G8|5|Very good product
B000C3YST4|5|K&N are a well known brand for a reason.  This filter was very easy to install and fits like stock.
B004B7YXOM|1|This unit didn't work for 5 different make/model cars and trucks. I contacted the seller who told me it wasn't compatible with an iphone or my laptops bluetooth. I was informed it only works with android. Tried on a nexus 1 and nexus s, neither worked. Unit never powered up so I was never able to see if it was useful. I returned the product for a refund and was unable to get a replacement from the seller.
B00335JQ7W|5|Great Price and Great fit!  These mats are more then half the cost from the Dealers mats and they look and fit so much better
B000EFCPOK|4|Thinner than expected but works great..
B003SYXRV4|5|Had son-in-law put it in 2 months ago.Less than an hour. Been working fine. No more transmission issues.
B003FWY786|5|These are great year round but especially in the winter to catch the grit that sticks to your shoes and boots. The heavy rubber lasts forever!
B00D3PI6DW|5|Mats were well made and looked great. All stitching an embroidering was impressive. They fit like a glove and installed easily.
B00GOJ3PQC|5|great price and it got here fast
B001A3ER3C|5|really warm i used it on a ride  temp was 28 after 100 mile ride i didn't notice the temp at all .
B008ZE8VRC|4|2013 Toyota Tundra CrewMax 2wd.  Installation was a breeze.  Took longer to put it together than to put on.  First tank of gas and saw an immediate 2 mpg increase.  Since then has settled down with about a 1 mpg increase.  Can tell the difference in power increase.  Love the &#34;throaty&#34; growl of the thing sucking air.  If I would keep my foot out of it, would probably see a better increase in mpg.  Would like to see it a little cheaper.
B0051W6KPQ|5|works well for its application
B001GDEAP6|5|I bought this as I am a Hospice Nurse who sees patients in their homes. My front seat was always covered with everything, and stuff would slide off and it was just crazy. This is a terrific organizer, with lots of pockets and compartments. I am constantly discovering a new item I can stash in here and still I have plenty of room. It has a strap which can secure it to the seatbelt, but I haven't had a problem with it falling off the seat so I don't use it. When someone needs to ride with me, I simply lift the whole shebang and stash it in my trunk. I love it!
B008G3KG70|5|Easy to install and really spruced up older 2001 pickup. Takes years off!
B0030I3V6E|5|This was so fun to have on my car during Christmas!  It held up well to wind.  I took it off my windows when it rained because they are made of fabric and I didn't want it to get wet and gross.  This is an adorable decoration for the car!
B00BKSJYUS|5|Perfect fit for my 1993 Range Rover Classic, and at a very reasonable price! Recommend it to any one who needs it!
B0089GM3ZW|5|make a job easy don`think twice if you need i do recommend this to you my friend if you need it!!!
B005HINTGC|5|2004-2007 FORD F150 SUPERCAB LH FRONT (DRIVER SIDE) POWER WINDOW REGULATOR ASSEMBLY . I ordered this part , it was here in less than a week, it fit right in and works perfect, what more can I ask for? WELL DONE !!
B003ZF1GJQ|4|liquid gold
B000UHIR3K|5|Great product which will work with various tracks. I use in an RV and the spring keeps things nice and quiet.
B008RT85LW|4|I'm happy with the way these guards look on my Jetta.  However, the install on the rear two was a pain because the pre-cut holes didn't line up with the ones on the car; so be prepared to do some drilling! Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with them.  Sure beats $60 for the OEMs!
B004EIDD2Q|5|I brought this last year and the power is great so I reccommend it to all my friends and family.<br />If you have an older car you may need this just in case Good Price fast Delivery
B0033WNNR4|1|The T-Connector kit did not fit my 2005 Equinox as the Find Parts chart said it would. Equiox and Terrain 2010-2011 are the only vehicles listed on the box.
B005MEZYEG|5|Great product for the cost.
B004AIGJDA|2|Did not fit as expected.  Had not maneuver & file off simp arts. It took too long to try to adjust.  Not all all what we bargained for.
B005HEAHAM|5|Look nice on the Benz.
B0074OL2I4|5|Worked out well
B00192QB3I|5|Use this regularly and works well.  Recommend it for anyone that needs this type of adapter.  Price is reasonable for this item.
B004IARL32|4|Put on my 2012 Tux Black Raptor. Love it, plenty bright and have had no issues with it not sealing against the cab (taken through many car washes and rainy weather). Not sure why others claiming it doesn't fit tight, I snugged the 2 screws down tightly and the seal is definitely pressed securely against the cab all the way around.<br /><br />Yes, the wiring instructions for Raptors is wrong. Brian Vitrano's review is correct on how to wire it. No big deal, takes 5 minutes. Looks so much better than that giant white thing Ford put up there.<br /><br />In combo with the Recon smoked tails I recently installed, am really happy with the look. (Have had this 3rd brake light on the truck for about a year).
B00AN9B3EA|1|Did not fit
B00144CZRM|5|The mold just melted away! I've tried everything to get rid of the mold on the vinyl seats of our boat! This product does the trick!
B000KK9V32|5|These are very comfortable boots.  Have walked many miles in them as well as ridden many thousand.  Never leaked even in very heavy rain.
B001TI5IIQ|1|Turtle Wax T-240KT Headlight Lens Restorer Kit  was frustrating and ineffective. The wipe on wipe off lens restoring fluid did almost nothing and the series of polishing scrubbers and solutions ended up scratching the headlight lens more than the pitting from time and road debris.  I would rate this as a scam unworthy of the Turtle Wax name.
B001A1M1J6|5|Harness plugged right into my 2013 Silverado 1500 with no problems. The product is good quality and I have not had a problem with it since I installed it.
B006WBLMOO|5|My Poulan Pro weedwacker stopped working. Instead of buying new carburator order this repair kit and used it to rebuild old carburator. Weedwacker running again.
B00042L0IA|1|Came pre ripped at the top.  Pretty cheap materials but works just like as well as the garbage bag I previously used.
B006X98A7C|4|It works, has decent battery life, was pretty cheap, I'm happy with it, I got it to replace the battery of a UPS I found at Goodwill for a few bucks, all in all I spent around 25 bucks, and now I have a decent UPS for my network and server.
B002LBRI4M|4|weather tech are better cut.
B007H2TF4Q|5|Great product and must add on to your Camco trailer block kit, highly recommend when supporting your RV is a concern.
B001D5JUXY|5|Excellent.  Met my expectations.  I still use a gauge, I think the auto shut off is a little off. Recommended.
B00876LAHG|1|I ordered this specifically because it was listed as OEM Kawasaki and would fit my 2012 Teryx Sport.  When it arrived it clearly would not fit, not even close.  It is probably for 2009 and earlier models, but not later years.  I contacted Leesons to request a refund and they denied their listing ever claimed this would fit my 2012 Sport, even after I copied their listing and emailed it back to them.  They did generate a return request for it, but I have to pay return shipping.  For their mistake.  It's not my fault but I'm out the money to return an item they messed up on.  This is a fine product, if it fits your year Teryx, but this seller is terrible.  I would NEVER do business with them again.
B00UGII0YE|3|it is black and does not show on my car window
B001HKDJ78|5|Very well made, very sturdy and the magnet holds like nobody's businesses! Keeps your keys safe and very well hidden. Very recommendable!
B007524XMC|5|I have a 2013 Buick Regal Turbo, this chrome aeroskin fits and looks great, it installs in minutes, 100% recommend.
B0076I7B9M|1|Barely had on for a month and the finish is already fadded off completely. Horrible quality especially for being the more expensive ones on Amazon . Wish they would send me new ones or refund me .
B00B0CYE8Q|5|Stickers were perfect for decorating clear cups
B002EIQQJU|5|Great
B004H5QPGC|5|I am very satisfied with the quality of the product, they look awsome almost as good as the originals.:)
B00FTDJ9FA|5|They work great!! Thank.you.  ...Good stuff!!! I will buy them again.
B000SQNOPE|2|I ordered this decal after looking around for quite a while. The product description does not accurately represent the fact that the sticker is NOT an outline of the Star of Life. It is a square decal containing the design within it. It was smaller than expected and no matter how carefully I prepared the surface and applied the sticker, I could not avoid bubbles. The outline of the clear square vinyl is plainly easy to see. I took it off about five minutes after applying it. Truthfully I would not buy this product again. Buyer beware...
B000B6CVZU|5|Quick exchange and looks exactly like the original did in my 2000 Silverado
B0067MH8P0|5|received part in timely manner and at a great cost.
B0006SH4PA|5|At first I was surprised by the thickness of the solution, but I didn't realize that it works better to dilute it with water according to the instructions(that I read later).  I use a paint brush to gloss up my tires. This stuff works great if you let it sit for a while and allow it to bake on in the sun. It gives a very crisp shine that lasts long even through a light rain. I will definely buy this again.
B0084UJJ78|5|Good product at a good price very easy to install did it in the dark in my driveway in about 30 min.
B008RAEKDS|5|It's been on for a few weeks and so far no leaks. I'm sure I'll love this gasket even more next time I change the differential lube.
B0006OA4FQ|5|Like any specialized task, you need the proper tool to do the job. A.S.T. is the specialty tool king. These adapters are the best in the industry. It sucks that car manufacturers do this to us mechanics, forcing us to buy specialty tools in order to service thier \\"special\\" vehicles. Assenmacher is the industry leader in specialty tools, and if they don't make it; then they probably will based on technicians' feedback.
B007I7D66S|5|these lights make my interior look white and bright. i love them and will be buying many more. great product.
B005RF6G4M|5|This fits perfectly on the dashboard.  Amazingly.  Solid materials.  The only complaint is that it is rather big and doesn't fold easily.  Instead you roll it up like a mini-bazooka.  Even with that complaint, I have no regrets.
B000C93ZJW|5|was exact fit for my application ........works well
B001KOB1ZS|5|I love this.<br /><br />I had a big crash on my KTM 530 exc which destroyed my stock display.<br />I bought this as a replacement but it is a big step up from stock.<br /><br />Works perfectly with stock speedo magnet and displays data including engine temp time riding distance etc in a more usable form. Great item and I plan to get for my other dirt bikes
B0062EI33O|5|Looks good, went right in with a bit of elbow grease... Great product.
B009S30WS0|5|Perfect fit!
B000LQ9YEG|5|Worked perfectly for replacing the battery in my kids Fisher-Price Power Wheels four-wheeler, just had to add connectors. Holds a good charge and much cheaper than the factory battery.
B000ALBZK8|5|Glued my husbands truck mirror back together after my sons basketball hoop fell on his truck and smashed his new mirrors apart.
B004B8GTQG|5|Anyone who owns a vehicle with rubber/soft surround on the doors, roof, trunk, hood, etc....<br />This product will soften and restore any rubberized type substance it touches.  Easy to use and resonably priced.  Two thumbs up!
B004ETGQKG|1|Good to prevent snow on the glass... but magnets scratched my new car :(<br />Be very careful using this product.
B00265M9SS|5|I used this to change the break fluid on my 2009 suzuki gsxr 750  , This is hands down the best tool and is so easy to use.  This is a must have on everyone tool kit.  It will save you so much money. Changing break fluid front and rear breaks cost over 200 from the dealership, now you can get it done on your own for a fraction of the price.
B003XFTUHI|5|Exactly what I wanted. Looks great! WV doesn't require a front tag, so I knew this is what I had to get.
B000UVUAFO|3|It did not remove the scratch.  I will need to apply some touch up paint before using it again.  We'll see if it works then.
B00B99UGOQ|1|It actually made the noise from my belt worse! Later I saw a can of this stuff in my friend's garage so I asked him what he thought of it - He said it sucks too. It's a waste of money.
B00GK9RDKK|4|lights are super bright and high intensity like stated.<br />There was one other review which was accurate in that the plug is weak and does not<br />stay in lighter output.<br />Just going to hard wire it to other lights in vehicle<br />Otherwise awesome.
B002R0MZ5O|5|Fit perfectly came with bulbs and all looks factory and great quality for the price!!! No regret on this one worth the money.
B008J5323K|5|Same filter that others are asking 8 bucks a piece for...so 4 for 11.oo and got them fast..that's a no brainer
B0002Z9R16|5|Fit great as replacement on PIAA frames.
B0002STSMQ|5|Work as specified. Little problem with room but did the job.
B000CPI03C|5|as it always is
B0010E3IU4|5|My local Valvoline charges almost twice as much to replace my air filter with this same product.  Highly recommend changing your own filter and saving money!  Its extremely easy to do.
B004ZBIZF2|5|Love it
B001ZS9VHO|5|Like another reviewer, I used this kit to repair stripped caliper bolt threads - in this case a 1999 Dodge Dakota. An internet search revealed that this is a common issue, and auto parts stores sell oversize thread-tapping caliper bolts as a remedy. Those cost something on the order of $15-$20 apiece, and would not work for me since there was just not enough good metal for the threads to bite into. In this situation a heli-coil will simply not do, so my only other option would have been to scour junkyards for a serviceable steering knuckle, turning a simple brake job into a total front-end rebuild & scavenger hunt.<br /><br />This kit includes everything necessary to do just such a repair at a price that compares favorably to rounding the pieces up individually. The tools are machinist grade and the inserts have a countersunk flange that provides a flush surface when finished and prevents the inserts from possibly being driven deeper into or through the hole. The kit comes with 13mm deep inserts. They also offer 22mm separately, which are what I had to use.<br /><br />As with any rethreading procedure, keep the tools lubricated and clear of metal chips using compressed air. With care and patience this kit will allow a bulletproof repair - otherwise it will be &#34;Hello junkyard&#34; and &#34;Goodbye weekend(s)&#34;
B001C7Y9UC|5|the kit Fits easy, fast,  fit to the car, good quality, fast delivery, good price..no special tools needed, in 5 minutes
B00DB8JDXI|5|Easy to install and looks amazing on my 2010 ram sport. Deffenetly recommend this for anyone looking for that sporty look
B008PRIQJW|5|Very cool
B000CITKCE|4|Bought November 2012 and failed this week.. time for a new one.
B000BQSIWK|5|It is very light and easy to use but also charges fairly quickly. I have had a few batteries \\"boil\\" but I think that is part of the process for reconditioning older batteries. It seems to have revived a few that I was ready to give up on. Read the manual- there are some tricks you need to learn to get it's full use.It will not jump start but a 15 minute charge will probably get you going.
B004WMF92G|5|My grandson and I are getting my 2004 Chevy Silverado ready for him for when he gets his license.<br />It has to look &#34;cool&#34;....a free truck.....but I'm having fun looking at items and the back and forth between us to decide on what &#34;HIS&#34; truck should look like!<br />We also went with the - IPCW CWG-CWS337VB Chevrolet Silverado Black Center Grille Conversion, to compliment these headlights.<br />I wish I could post a picture once they are installed.  It's still Winter here, and we are waiting for Spring to do the installations.
B000CGPMC8|5|Was exactly the advertised product at a great price. The Edelmann 80264 Power Steering Pressure Hose was almost double at my local auto parts store.
B001B5KPOE|4|Fit fine on 2006 WRX Limited, quite a bit of chatter. Good quality from a well known company, but I would likely go another route due to the amount of chatter.
B003Y7QUDW|4|Purchased as a gift, the adjustable back makes it a perfect fit.  The quality material make it a perfect hat.  The black on black is almost undetectable in real life, so it isn't going to be some flashy banner for the car on your head.  I love the way it looks and fits!  Quality workmanship in the stitching and manufacturing- arrived well shaped.
B00FJDL0J8|5|THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!! Chemical guys stuff is THE BEST!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B008032QBA|5|Fast Delivery and it was exactly what it was supposed to be. Works great! Thanks :)<br />If you need a good fuel pump these work great!
B001BB4LBG|4|Looks great, still in use, lets see if it goes passed a Vegas 112 degree summer before it burns down, will upgrade to 5-star if that's the case.
B000VLHCBI|5|Install it on a warm day so the material is easier to stretch.  Installation is pretty straight forward, just follow the directions step by step.  They also have installation videos.  The tinted windows are a great upgrade to the factory clear.  I noticed a slight decrease in wind noise over my factory cover...nothing ground breaking.  Excellent quality and the fit is spot on, making a tight seal.  Rain and snow does not penetrate.  I wouldnt hesitate to buy this again if I needed a new top.
B000N5R6WM|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 gsxr 750 does not look like the pic tho kinda looks like they just slapped a Yuasa sticker on a random battery works tho
B004GDDAJU|5|this is what i needed at a very good price it waw at my front door in two day and a quality product
B00Q1BM7SU|1|You can't see it unless you are in complete darkness, and even then, it's incredibly dim. Also, really stupid to use a break away chain for dog tags. I lost it after about a day cuz it got snagged on something.
B008W1NNM6|5|Perfect, thanks
B0052SF0LO|5|I'm using this in my carport, and I love it.
B001A4FPC8|5|This was exactly what I needed in order to check amp draw through a fuse terminal with an &#34;amp clamp&#34; style multimeter. I had originally made my own version of this before I knew something like this existed, but I didn't even think to incorporate a fuse into it so that I wouldn't fry a bunch of electronics if there were any issues (which of course happened to me). I showed this to the big boss at work, and explained why we need these if they want us to use the new amp clamps that are replacing our regular style multimeters (which have leads for checking amperage).
B006ERS6OU|5|Took this kit with us on a week long camping trip and every piece was used. Does not take up much space and is easy to clean. A must if you're in to Cub Scouts or Boy Scouts.
B00GZZ1YCW|3|As compared with good-old Rain-x - I have to go with a rating of &#34;meh.&#34;<br /><br />It took me about 40 minutes to follow the instructions - wash the windshield, dry and then apply the product.<br /><br />Water runs off it that for sure.  It might be more durable than Rain-X, time will tell on that.<br /><br />This morning when I went out to get in my truck the windshield was covered in dew. I was surprised at this as our other car didn't have anything on the windshield.<br /><br />Driving in the rain I believe it works just as well as repelling water, but it just seemed more annoying to apply the product than with rain-x.
B001P1R6QY|5|Good quality decal and says all that needs to be said. Had to problem applying and so far looks like it will last.
B000ALG86E|4|It's more lightweight than I would like, but it fits my car very well and stays on through heavy winds. In order to keep my car cool and clean, I bought three of these and treat them like one car cover made from three layers. One layer alone wouldn't last long through summer, as when the roof of the car gets hot, the material suffers and falls apart more quickly. Having those extra layers keeping the roof of the car cool solves the problem. I find this to be a far superior solution to buying one more expensive, heavier car cover - I've tried those and they start to disintegrate as soon as the summer sun hits my car.
B004DRV8HA|3|Very reasonably priced and they work, Fastening brackets snap off but light can be safely jury rigged by garage.Having clear lens is important. After a few moths the cheap bracket snapped. I push headlight back in regularly.
B007KPWNBC|5|It went on easy and fit perfect
B0085WXLCY|5|I purchased this to use with a OBDll bluetooth reader. The angle plug and 6' cord helped me to move the device out of my way under the steering column. Worked perfectly. No Problems. Fast delivery.
B009D4KUPY|5|Looks great !
B007KP0IK0|5|Quick shipment, and is just what my mower needed.. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a starter.Easy to put on mower, up and running in no time...
B001PWA0IO|3|This is a little tight in the tailgate so it has already pinched all the rubber off of the tailgate straps.<br /><br />It makes a god awful flatulent sound every time it opens.  My school aged boys love it, but I'm not a fan.<br /><br /> Functionally this should be something that Ford just includes on every one of their trucks.  It is way easier to get it open when my hands are full.  I also don't need to worry about the kids walking under the tailgate at just the wrong moment and getting clobbered.  This makes it open nice and smooth.
B0000DEW8P|5|This product works great.  My daughter is almost 5 months old and we've been using this chair for almost a month now with no problems.  I put her in the seat for feeding and while I make dinner.  She also loves the tray.  I haven't used it in a chair yet.  We usually use in on top of our island in the kitchen.   <br /> <br />Because this chair is so portable, it has also worked out great for feeding my daughter at work.   <br /> <br />It's a great alternative to a high chair.  At least for now, I have no intentions of buying a high chair.
B005RNEH5O|5|Been trying some cheaper silicone grease, but decided to drop the extra bucks and sleep better putting this on my caliper pins. My GM Blazer rubber bushings really crapped out using that green stuff... swelled them up to the point everything locked up... changed the rubber and went with the paste.... no more worries.  Thanks ETCG.
B005E39NS8|5|Great
B009OBW23O|5|Applied by hand to a 1998 white van after applying using Meguiar's Smooth Surface Clay Kit and Meguiar's Ultimate Compound. Excellent results. From a heavily oxidized dull finish, the paint has a glossy appearance again. I have waxed my car twice now and must have at least 2/3s left in the tube.<br /><br />This description says, \\"This unique wax contains an advance blend of micro cleaners that remove below surface contaminants to make the paint in your vehicle pop...\\" If your car is not heavily oxidized you should be able to apply this wax two or three times per year without having to apply polish or a rubbing compound.
B005BNYV2Y|5|Last year I put 3M's tape on my outdoor steps to prevent slips in the rain. It peeled, I had to staple it down, eventually it tore. Gone! Then I got this tape, and problem(s) solved.
B00G5MSU9U|5|Great product
B0009H51TE|5|I put it in my car a passed emission test with not problem works very well i suggested to my friends.
B000MALLWY|5|Works great, no issues.
B00NI7SVYY|4|Alls well I recommend
B004GEWMFC|3|First thing first, obviously its not OEM, but the fit and construction are very good. Does not come with rubber grommets to sit intercooler. There are two sensors on top right and left, OEM support has welded square nuts, this one is predrilled but you will need to supply your own nuts. Some of the pre mounted nuts are not well installed and spin as you try to tighten the bolts, thus you need to secure then with vise grips from the back (in my case the 3 latch bolts would spin).<br />I give this item 3.5 stars and considering the price, and the fact that everything aligns would purchase again.
B004TR8PU2|5|I have been towing travel Trailers for some time, and must admit the Equalizer is the best I've used.<br />Weight distribution works very well, and sway control is just outstanding.<br />We can tow in strong winds without white knuckling it. In fact, most of the time I forget we have a TT behind us in tow.<br />Initial setup takes a bit of effort, but after that it is very simple matter to connect and go!<br />The system is made in the USA, very heavy duty and solid.
B004FGRAZ8|5|Better than factory tool; great leverage, perfect fit. Don't make a expensive mistake by trying homemade tool, get this wrench!!!
B00EE79YKC|5|Love my penlight.  Keep in my shirt pocket at all times.  I am always in need of a light.  I have given them for gifts to friends and family.  This a practical gift.  Believe you will enjoy one.
B003JLCK28|1|Within the first month all of the weather striping on the inside of the seems had fallen off and it was pretty much useless at stopping any water.
B00407YQ4U|5|Exact match
B000NCOKZQ|5|Great product and work like a charm.
B001TJZ6IC|5|Fits well. Feels insulated and cushy. I bought the black version and it looks classy. My car is a Honda Accord 1995.<br /><br />I don't understand people complaining about needing to cut holes for seatbelts, because on my car you can just slip the seat belt buckle in between the two pieces of fabric that cover the back, so this was not an issue but I guess people have other car designs.<br /><br />It comes with all these extra straps and things that I didn't even use and also a bunch of metal clips that I didn't find a use for, and were not explained in the packaging.<br /><br />I love them and will probably buy a set for my mother.
B006TMM9V6|5|Product fit perfectly. Good quality for a Great price
B0002VC2OY|5|I just got a new Honda Fit which has a 28x40 cargo area. The custom fit cargo tray can not be found on eBay or elsewhere for less than $80. It retails for $109, then there's shipping. Customers also complain about how thin the custom fit tray is. Well, this $20 tray (free shipping if you buy something else like I did) is ideal. The 28\\" side fits perfect, and the extra 6\\" next to the sides of the cargo area are fine with me. I keep folded towels there since they come in handy with the beaches here in Florida. The mat is black which matches the interior of the 2008 Honda Fits. The mat is heavy duty, quality with a 100 year warranty (yes - 100 years!). Love it.
B00VNBEJ1G|5|These are great lights, super bright.
B001W91J8K|4|Towels come out clean with no product residue.  This product works.
B005ES6H32|5|Product as described. Shipped very fast and undamaged. Best price found on Amazon for this brand new axle. Installed by a shop, and works perfectly!
B001PWFPE8|3|Bought this for my dads Chevy. Overall decent product. Instructions are useless, does not tell you that but must be turned counterclockwise. Had to go to YouTube figure out. Also does not work as good Ford version. Showers the decent but can't just allow to drop like with Ford
B00DZ4GZUC|5|I just bought two more of these for friends because it's so easy to use and works great.  Much easier than using a cloth and it makes it easy to pick up smaller items that need dusting and rub them with your hands.  We live in the desert where things are always dusty and this makes cleaning a breeze.
B008041SNQ|4|Fast effective charging
B002303KNE|5|Really good service and description of bulb was right on and fitted perfectly.  Thanks!
B002LEEY1E|5|Great Transaction with Seller..item was exactly as Pic...
B00546A92E|5|This is perfect for my 2004 Toyota 4Runner.
B000E24APU|1|This product is not a toy.  It was purchased to repair a rip in my leather car seat.  However, it did not work and seems to have caused more of a mess than good.  The substance came out of the bottle like runny liquid and just did not hold anything together.  Better to use a professional rather than to purchase this useless product.
B004XPH55Q|5|These Brazimoto gloves are excellent quality.  There seems to be a lot of confusion on sizing when it comes to the Brazimoto gloves on some web forums, but if you use the sizing chart on the Brazimoto website, everything should be ok.  I am an XL or L in most gloves.  I ordered a Large pair and they were perfect.  They are very soft deerskin leather that is snug at first, but streches to a very nice fit (Dont order too big, because they will stretch).  They are not too tight or too big, but perfect for a motorcycle glove.  They are not insulated, so you might not want them for cold weather riding, unless you order a larger size and get an insulated glove liner.  Plus, they look exactly like Katos gloves from the 2010 Green Hornet movie, so that is kinda cool.  I would order these gloves again!!  (PS. Shipping was very fast by Amazon)
B0058DIDTY|3|Tears easy but looks good
B000VB3NR0|5|I purchased the front floor liner and wondered if I should also order this rear floor liner. Glad I did. They fit perfectly and really compliment the front liner. They offer great carpet protection in a good looking package.
B00KTIR1ZU|5|Works great
B000NZSUOK|2|They fit great and arrived fast... Only problem is the passenger side light *the small one where trunk key hole is* that light Has moisture in it.. I'm alil  bummed but ohwell...
B00480GYSA|5|The only thing that concerns me, is whether they will last a reasonable length of time. If they do they will be super. They really light up the road and they are bright white. I wonder if other reviewers were simply commenting on the the yelliwing lens cover.
B001PRX7WK|5|I bought this product for my GF who just had rotator cuff surgery. It works great. i would recommend it.
B00BMRZN66|5|I have only test the product be it seem to work well.  The witch is on the top of the battery compartment.  On the next version of this I hope they but the switch on the handle like a real gas pump.
B000AMBNPY|1|Suction cups do not stick.
B000OZTPKC|3|I like the seat covers but they don't fit my seats really well...well enough to keep though.
B001N41U1A|4|This liner will hide stains in the carpet beneath and also keep fresh ones out.  It seems a little cheap in quality considering the price, but it does the job.  I was thinking it would be a bit thicker.  I think they had to make the material thin considering the lip is so large...this makes it really nice.  We're happy with it overall.
B0040DX7EO|1|Plastic clip ons break easily and not wide enough to clip on to a Camry mirror. Top clips broke, then bottom and had to use rubber bands to keep it on. Never stayed in place. Don't buy.
B00BI4WN8O|5|Got my order in less time than showed. Installed right away looks great! Zero complaints
B000C55VXY|5|great quality and price!
B006FXGW94|5|Yup, i recommend it to anyone..
B000C55SVE|4|Thank you, installed on my honda vtx1800, works great
B000GASX9O|5|I have this one and an older 70 amp model. I use them for maintaining new batteries, charging agm batteries, and while coding cars, bmw, mercedes, volvo etc.  This is great around a shop because you can set it and forget it.  I can leave it on a car overnight to try and revive old batteries.  I measured the ripple with a 40 amp load against a really expensive model that I had before and was very impressed.  The ripple was slightly higher although very acceptable.  I've coded many cars with this and have not blown any modules yet.  The customer service is also very helpful when I've called them.  Built in America and built well
B000VDX170|5|Absolutely love my floor mats! I drive a toyota corolla so i was a little nervous they would be too big and not look good. But they fit great and look awesome!
B000NCOKZQ|5|Love it. good quality. Just what I wanted.
B004TR8F5C|5|Very good price.  Came quickly.  Packaging was not damaged and its exactly as decribed
B00AVYGEJG|4|Noticed a very slight AM dropoff, maybe like 10% or so in fringe areas... not enough to go back to the original 1 ft long whip on my 2014 Volt.
B005FKBYLO|5|These brakes rule. Fits nicely on my 05 magnum RT. Extremely high quality. I would definitly recommend these brakes for anyone who needs more stopping power then the stock rotors.
B000HEA95A|5|Worked great with the basket. No complaints here!
B000I5ELNY|4|Not capable of being attached to the control unit as an intercom for your rider.  Have to get a different one to make that work.  Description didn't say anything about that.
B004QMXTBU|5|I replaced without mod.
B006H3IGWS|5|These fits the Infiniti G37 fronts without issues.  Rides well.  Price is reasonable.  Great product.  Not adjustable like KYB but also not as expensive.
B001RLXADA|5|Perfect !
B00B9IVRCW|4|Bought this for our new camper.  It was exact fit and easy to wire up.  It could be a little faster but if its lifting a lot of weight I guess slow and steady is better.
B000EDSTAG|4|This might not work if you have an old furnace or water heater that requires a flame to heat the element before the pilot stays lit, but for a gas stovetop it's great!
B000GRT40Y|5|I bought this to replace the one on the bike because I bought the bike wrecked. It fit right on the brackets that were on the bike.
B0000AY2Z6|4|I use it for keeping my kids cool in the boat.  Pushes a lot of air.  I have never used it on the high setting because low and medium do the trick.  It also does NOT kill my marine battery after a couple of hours of use.  The only downside so far is the &#34;feet&#34; to steady the fan are not quite large enough to balance when a decent group of waves hit the boat.  I would definitely buy again.
B00A1A38TE|1|Steering Shaft did not fit, due that 2007 - 2009 Chevy Avalanche and big SUV's requiters that it retractable shaft that moves back and forth.  this low score is only for the part not the suppler.
B0074EJ5X8|4|The steering wheel cover fits great on small steering wheels like on my Honda civic. the Grey color looks great and matches my black interior. The holes in the cover make it look sporty if that's the look you're going for. It was pretty easy and simple to put on so I wouldn't worry about any issues with installation. I've had the product for a couple months now and haven't had any quality issues. It looks and feels good so I would recommend it.
B0028B0GTO|4|Looks good and easy to install .  I like the look,  and I hope it does not get any rust since it looks like its probably Chinese made Stainless which will often start to rust...
B002ZBPX1S|4|The leather that we have is the rougher, what I call 'unpolished' but is really full grain leather. It doesn't have the high shine of top grain leather so this product definitely worked differently.<br /><br />I tried this on an ottoman that had a few stains (pen, a glass mark) and lots of general use wear. I did test it in a discreet area first and knew going into it that it would leave it slightly darker. With that in mind, I used it on the entire top of the ottoman. It sank in really quickly and was much darker. I really had nothing to wipe off since the leather soaked it all up. But my rag had some discoloration with may have come from the leather dye - although it was very minimal. The end result is that the ottoman has dried to a slightly darker version and evened out some of the stains but has not removed them. I would have been amazed if they did come out since they had really penetrated. Overall, the leather looks in better condition, like it's been given a good drink after being thirsty. Which is probably what has happened!<br /><br />I believe it will work better on a top leather surface and in using it on smaller leather products, it has done a good job.
B003UQYZGQ|5|Got a new car and need to move your EZ Pass?  These strips look like the original strips.  3M.  Nothing more to say.  This is what you need.
B0009ETC6U|5|I have had it done to me with kryptos and I'll tell YA what! One time I lost my keys cause ring broke but I had bike key in other pocket. I got a u lock krypto off my bike w a screw driver n lil hammer! 3 minz done! And I would never steal a bike but it was mine! W my lock. All I know is ABUS DISC ETC LOCKS, chains are the best around! I put the abus trigger on front rotor n abus chainlock on rear.<br />If they can get thru that b4 I get to them then they deserve the bike!<br /><br />Lol I will leave them where I find them n maybe I'll leave the chain too! Around they're necks!
B00IPRINGS|4|They work great even with my 2&#34; risers. If I move my hand up and forward about 1-2&#34; I can feel where the air is. Almost don't realize how affective they are until you move you hands into the airstream which confirms your purchase.<br /><br />I need to figure something out because both mirrors do fold in but the mirror and guard rub slightly which I think can lead to wear marks in the future. Might try a washer on the uppermost bolt to raise them up a hair. Also DON't OVER TIGHTEN the replacement bolts , I felt my plastic crack a bit which won't affect anything but my fault for trying to overtighten. I'm talking somewhere in INCH POUND torque specs would suffice. Just be mightful, once they are tight stop.<br /><br />Overall I am very glad SSD made these for my C14, well worth it for cooler seasons. I will run them all but the warm months. They don't look bad either.
B00ASKRKYQ|5|Great item. No more GPS hanging from the windshield.
B004C1ZRMO|5|This fit in same spot as original. No problem.
B003IHMHLW|5|Works great on my trailer.  Easy to install.
B003AVYGI8|5|I put a set of these Prothane mounts in my '04 Cavalier (yes, it does fit despite Amazon saying it doesn't.) with the GMPP supercharger with 2.9&#34; pulley and a few other small mods.  This one mount got ovaled out a bit where the center piece goes through and it started making a clunking sound when I'd press or release the gas.  The engine mount and rear trans mount are still nice and solid.  The total movement in this one was about 1/16 to 1/8&#34;, but the polyurethane is hard enough that it makes a racket.  It was installed in the car for about 30k miles/4 years before this started.  I'd like to give 4.5 stars because of this, but that rounds up to 5.<br /><br />These are a must if you add any power, the stock rubber mounts flex WAY too much at 250 HP and even quite a bit back at 145 HP.  They increase the vibration felt inside the car quite a bit, but that's to be expected.  Still much smoother than solid steel mounts.
B000JFNAJY|5|Use it on all my trucks big and small. So far a great unit.
B00F5X60W4|5|A+
B007LICSEA|5|Performs to specifications
B004KDEWTS|1|Torx screwdriver was too big to fit Iphone 4 screws.  Not sure what it fits but it isn't the AT&T Iphone 4 that I ordered it to repair.
B000H6P55W|4|We could not have been more pleased, holds a great deal and though it didn't rain I do hope it is waterproof. Will use lots.
B00N7B8KSS|1|doesnt work for my key fob
B00EKTIGBC|2|The adhesive strips included are inferior. The covers are slightly warped and the adhesive started to release a day after I put the covers on. I followed the directions and cleand all surfaces with alcohol. Please fix the problem
B001O88RPM|5|This product was as beautiful and in great condition when it arrived.  Now to find time to put in on my car!
B000CLMPEG|3|I don't see how anyone can rate these as 5 star pads. They don't have the steel backing plate or the wear warning tang riveted to the back of the pad like the OEM pads.  They do provide a warning tang that clips on but that is really cheesy. The ears that slide in the stainless steel clips are not smooth, they are a little rough because the whole piece is cast. I took a file and GENTLY smoothed the contact surfaces of the ears. There was some extra cast blob on them that I had to chisel away. That should have been caught by the QC department. The OEM pads were nice and smooth on the sliding ears. We will see how they wear. Wagner makes good stuff but I will not be buying these particular pads again.
B00J65IQSS|5|Works really good!
B0088NY19W|5|Fits well and is a good weight to protect from elements.
B004HEF8QG|4|Theses pads came to me fine they would also get a 5 star if the quality was five star rated
B00F8WCJ1S|5|For those who served and retired you can now buy these and let other know who you are. Thanks to all of my Brother and Sisters. May God Watch  over those sill serving.
B0087XOTWW|4|These work good in camper over bed. Not very bright but it allows us to see without waking up others.
B0028MJGGW|4|Nice product, worked well for my purpose!<br /><br />The Tusk wrench is made well has a nice ergonomic grip and enough ends to fit most all typical spoke nuts.  The ends are made from steel, so they wont wear out and strip the nuts. The rubber grip also protects the wheel rim as you adjust the spoke tension. Since I completly tore down & re-conditioned my wheels I needed a good tool considering all the adjustment I needed to make when truing the re-laced wheels for both radial and in-plane run-out.  This product is very reasonably priced for it's quality and is small enough to add to the cycle's on-board tool kit.
B001TI5IIQ|3|Worked alright initially but didn't hold up too long.
B00M069IAK|3|Did not fit on my Moto Guzzi California Custom as indicated in the description. Quality of the product is fantastic.
B0053SKJAK|5|Sets right in 55 gallon drum, a few pumps by hand and the water flows out.  Easy to use.  Quick valve on top to stop the flow.
B008Y58AHI|3|This brake line being made to fit a Suzuki 2004 RM250 only. Fits, at best, just ok.  There seems to be some problem with the 2004 model because nobody makes a replacement that actually fits.  Also, this line has a white plastic sheth that looks kinda lame.  The quality is good and it will work.
B005Z7FYBI|5|The quality and ease to apply the decal is first rate. The item is everything it is advertised.  Ruger 1911
B00CC4LX2G|5|Good lights super bright had to order a few extra ones right away cuz some came broke already but these lights are super bright
B00M9D9638|5|JUST WHAT THE TRAILER NEEDED
B00MJ4PJDI|5|excellent
B00563C086|5|fits perfectly in a 2008 Harley Davidson XL883L.  Provides plenty of starting power at a very good price.  Will consider this battery for future needs as well.
B001NAUAI8|5|The K&N air filter made for my Sporster 883 is of high quality part as any K&N products. It fits perfectly! and it performes well .<br />Amazon  service was oustanding ,the merchandise arrived as promised and the return and refund for the wrong part were simple and fast.<br />Thank you.
B005JVNLSS|5|Great suit and can't beat the price
B0009V1WS4|4|I have it for half a year now, so far so good. I guess it is because I live in southern california. I use it for my Yakima bike rack, so it fits on the threaded Yakima hitch pin.
B007GR7Q7A|1|do not be deceived by this add this is not what it reads this is only a single 1 liter bottle...after contacting powersport  the did give me a free shipping return lable and offered a full refund said there was a mistake with the listing at this price it would be around 271.80 per case  the add is still showing on amazon .first time I ever got ripped off on amazon before..hope this helps someone else in the future what a let down<br /><br />this is the response I received<br /><br />I apologize for this inconvenience it appears we have a bad listing on amazon as this was just suppose to be for a 1 liter bottle. I have gone ahead and put a prepaid return label into process so you can send that item back to us free of charge for a full refund. The return label will be sent to your email within 1-2 business days if you have any further questions please don't hesitate to ask.<br /><br />Thank You,<br />Alfonso S.<br />Customer Service
B004IL96U2|3|Ordered and received real quickly; while it does look good, it is made of flimsy material.  It is not the solid metal type that I have seen others have on their Ram.  Looks good, just a little cheap.
B003FBV8ZW|5|My husband love these the moment he put them on.  He is so happy.he wears them all at different time of the day.
B003E0RJ7K|5|This kit saves us a ton of time replacing ball joints without having to extensively disassemble suspension.  It's precisely made, and the storage case is well thought out.
B0051URY6M|5|Made out of reasonably stiff pvc, this cargo liner is a pefect fit for 2011 Toyota Highlander Hybrid.  The only issue anyone may have is that it doesn't fold up in a similar way to the original equipment carpet mat when using the 3rd row seating.... Not an issue as you usually can think ahead, though if forgetful, this could be a concern.<br /><br />The quality of the liner is vey good.  The grooves are both aesthetic and functional.<br /><br />Hope this helps, Mike
B004UQQVJY|4|seems to remove old wax ... but may take two applications
B000JFJLP6|5|Man do I love this thing! You can set their server up to email you to remind you to top this charger off every so often.<br />It fit perfect in the side of my trunk in my 2008 Aura XR and it has many uses! Great to cary for an emergency!
B00295NV0U|5|While not the most cost effective headlamps available, the price was still quite reasonable. These lights are just plain cool. The blue ring is fun and they made my truck look like a whole different vehicle. I will say, though, that they are made from ordinary cheap plastic. Not sure what the future holds as far as scratching or yellowing is concerned. But, for now I really love these.
B000GKIEJS|5|These products really worked on both the glass & the plastic windows, Great stuff
B008D30WCC|3|I DIDNT EXPECT IT TO BE SUCH A SMALL SET OF BARS, BUT IT DOES THE JOB. YET NOT AS EFFICIENTLY AS A FULL SIZE SET WOULD. THEY NEED TO BE ADVERTISED WITH A SIZE.
B0077K8IT6|5|I like it, this oil I use regularly on my car. Cool thing about it, is that the case has 6 single quarts and I use approximately 4 quarts, so after my fourth oil change I have enough to change my oil without purchasing another case, just the filter.<br /><br />Depending upon how you drive changing oil I presume will differ, but I was surprised this last time I changed my oil wasn't until 9k miles in and the oil was still clear. On average I change it every 6-9k miles.
B00GBSCROC|4|swallowed up all my metric wrenches and saved room in my motorcycle toolbox. taking off one star because  they should use velcro instead of those strings... that the only annoying part, tying those strings every time.
B0006IX87S|5|Have used this filter for almost a year now and will be replacing it in the next few weeks. Really don't know how you can tell if it is used up or not, but we're just going to replace it every year until we find out something different. Having said that we can attest that there have not been any illness's, bad tastes or smells from our water when we've been hooked up to a park's water supply. Have been in RV Resorts to overnight spaces and so far everything has been fine.
B00H1L48MM|2|Very low quality. Did not last long for my husband's mail route. Might be OK if used more on the dash instead of on the top of the car.
B005MZZCQU|4|It's a little smaller than I envisioned, but I didn't measure it out before I ordered it. I still think it is worth the money.  Very nice.
B000H8QCHK|4|It took a while to arrive -- longer than my usual amazon purchases.  May just have been an anomaly with processing/ delivery though.<br /><br />That aside, this light housing is stupendous.  It dosen't shoot laser beams at my enemies or anything like that, but installation was terribly easy.  The minor drawback about it that I noted was that I apparently have an older model of the vehicles that used this assembly, and it required light modification on my part to make the reverse lamp fit.<br /><br />Apparently Ford changed from a 4-wing attachment to a 2 wing attachment at some point during production.  So my car had a 4 wing, but the light assembly came with a 2 wing hole.  My cross shaped peg wouldn't fit into the oval shaped hole!<br /><br />A small notice was included with the lamp indicating that an adapter would be needed if this was the case, but nothing was mentioned in the item's Amazon description that I recall, so I had no clue until the item arrived.  Nor, until I actually took off the old lamp assembly to put on the new one.<br /><br />While it would have been nice to have known that I needed an adapter before I tried to install the lamp, I was able to manage it with a little bit of pocket knife modification surgery, rather than getting any silly adapters.
B0087NB36C|5|Works great with my phone and cb at the same time. Even at 90 mph
B001QVG3KI|1|this item worked fine for about 3 to 5 months then all of a sudden the needle went haywire, i contacted the manufacturer and they instructed me on doing a bunch of stuff as if i was installing it for the first time! they did not accept that it just stopped working all of a sudden and pointed out that it was a bad installation on my part (wich was not true because it was working fine for the months i mentioned earlier), so not very nice and i would not recommended because of this!
B00684TCWY|4|Easy to program. Range isn't as strong as factory keyfobs, but it's still a good quality!! I would buy more if I needed it
B00AN5V24K|5|nice smooth braking
B0002KR9Q6|2|Locks burnt out after a few uses
B00429NKWK|5|It takes some time to apply, but when done your headlights are like new.  Be careful to follow the directions exactly.
B00O0SRA60|2|Not all of the LEDs worked; had an electrician install them and 2 of 6 bars of LEDs did not light up
B000637TNM|4|always a good product that is easy to use.
B00CI95L2I|5|Love it!
B007ZGBLNW|4|easy to install, works good
B0085CAQJA|5|what you would expect of a mustang seat the quality is extremely high and the style is perfect I recommend this product
B00B0QHBJG|5|This switch works perfect for what Im using it for. Easy to wire and install in my vehicle. No problems since I installed it.
B0012TZ04E|3|Good price, decent reviews. Arrived quickly.<br />I'm not big nor do I have a large head. My hat size is 7-1/8\\"  at the max. But this product was SMALL!<br /><br />- Does it fit underneath a helmet/hat/etc? Yes, nicely I might add.<br />- Is it lightweight and extremely compactable? Yes.<br />- Too small? no \\"too small\\" not for me but darn close. It is uncomfortable.<br />- Will it shrink? goodness I hope not!<br />- Would I buy it again? No, I would look into a different product that may fit better.<br />- Would I recommend it to a friend? No.<br /><br />In all fairness it is only uncomfortably tight over the nose, everywhere else is snug which I expect from something like this. But there was inadequate anatomical consideration when designing this pattern: there is as much circumferential space for the forehead as the nose. In other words it is a straight cut instead of a larger and anatomical shaped area for the nose. The result is similar to mens compression shorts/tights which do not have a pouch for the... man... if you catch my drift. Another good comparison is jeans that have adequate space for the... trunk. Why wasn't this designed the same way to fit an actual human body? This question led me to the ZANheadgear website where I realized some of the higher end balaclavas were designed with this in mind. Thus the cheapest balaclava they sell (this one) does not have nose space. If the price point was the main thing drawing you to this product I would look into comparable products that have the nose space design at similar, although slightly higher, prices.
B0027FT8BI|5|Great product, perfect fit.
B00H0LPGYW|5|Amazing in every way!  These decals have such great detailing - they have a fun shadow look on my car - just love it.  Contacted the seller for a question, received a quick and very friendly response.  Nothing beats a good product combined with excellent customer service!
B0056A50PY|5|I put this sticker by the back passenger window.  I think it looks sooo cute, and it was super easy to apply.  I applied this one from the inside, perhaps this will make it last forever, since it is not exposed to weather etc.
B006ZNBT6K|5|Truck runs much better now.
B009I6B434|5|worked great !
B009ZNKITG|5|I purchased a refurbished washer/dryer combo and was very happy that it came with an extended warranty.  The product is great---but having the added peace of mind is even better!
B000FQ24Q2|5|Works and looks perfect. Easy instal
B00MN92QI0|4|Have not hooked up yet, smaller than expected. Hope there bright enough for tinted glass
B00IHGRIJK|5|We bought four of these for the little girls coming to visit and they thought they were VERY cool, with the pink cammo theme.  Plus, more importantly, they fit snugly and kept them safe on their ATV adventures!
B00ONHBUT6|5|Great seller.  Very fast shipping.  Great deal for the money. Very happy with it.
B001N2O3PM|5|worked well
B007X7XTTC|1|I bought this for possible use on my 2013 Si.  Honestly the product is complete cheap junk.  It is light-weight plastic and about as flimsy as it gets.  I would not put these emblems on my car.  I ended up just shelving them and spending the extra money for the JDM's from Japan.  Save your money and keep your OEM's on, or splurge and get the Japanese JDM's.
B00JRYHG70|4|Helps to not have cables hanging down to get caught on something.
B00590TWXC|5|I was taking my husband at 5am to a local hospital to have a total shoulder replacement surgery. As we were driving to the hospital the was this loud &#34;bam&#34;  Gate lock. 23--37--19.outside my window. Turns out that we had a storm the night before and a tree fell but was laying on the guardrail and was jutting into the street. It knocked the entire mirror off and it was in a million pieces. Found the perfect replacement on Amazon. It arrived quickly and wad easy to put on.
B004GFTC0E|4|Worked great for my old ford. was a bit time consuming but it really removed the old dull yellowing plastic surface.
B00603DZGW|5|easy to install,fixed the problem on drivers side door on 89 Jeep Cherokee
B006X152SU|3|THis bag is the right size sitting behind the low sissy bar on my softail. I carry it in to work daily. The shoulder strap was weak so I replaced it with one from another bag otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars.
B001J2CI8U|2|Vendor performed as agreed. Shipped on time, exactly as described.<br />The pump itself is substandard in quality.<br />Very noisy; audible inside the car cabin. Annoying! On GOOGLE many complaints attest to its being noisy. If electric motor humming noise bothers this may not be for you. BTW.. manufacturer considers noise to be normal, so expect no adjustment.
B004JV63GG|5|Has held up to the weather and UV rays remarkably well.
B001ROSUVO|5|Good Product.  Good Price
B005MZVNB8|5|Pretty simple... nice magnet, cheap price, etc.  It's not the highest of quality, but it's as described, would order again.
B007SPWRII|5|The product arrived on time. It seems like the most genuine BMW product I received online. The oil filter looks exactly like the picture. Very happy with it.
B001NI7KE2|5|I bought this clothes bar to replace my broken, cheaper one.  This one is great as other reviewers have noted.  Stout and well made. It's actually quite heavy.  Design seems to have been well thought out -- the bar can be hooked into a car in various ways, textured rubber coating keeps clothes from sliding around, and the beefy design will support lots of clothing.  Recommended.
B0018YD2UM|4|paired with the quick lift front strut/coil and rear spacer from rancho and so far so good. My only gripe so far would be that at level 9 which is the stiffest they are still pretty soft and anything below 7 seems very soft to me on my 2005 pathfinder. I hear these dont last more than 6 months but I got a $120 rebate from rancho for buying them with the rest so I went for it and after 2 months they are still working well. If you dont get a rebate I would go with bilstein instead for the same price.
B008ESJFU6|5|This fit great and was really easy to install. All I needed was a screwdriver. Buying this here saved me a lot of money.
B0006IX87S|5|No more yucky drinking water.  Nothing worse than to have nasty tasting coffee in the morning because of water in the campgrounds. No more with this.
B00ISB55NU|5|Just what I required very pleased
B002FCC3TW|5|Perfect fit, easy bolt on. Im very happy with the delivery time and how easy it was to install. When i first bought headers with these guys there was no hassle in returning my my money. Customer satisfaction is guaranteed!!!
B0051S4VP6|4|For the price I paid I received a very good product, can't complain. I have big hands and the gloves fit comfortably.
B0052SF0LO|5|Great Product! Easy to mount and it Works Great really like the constant ON Switch it has so I can use it when I need it!
B000HHV2XK|5|Yes , exactly what I wanted
B003SNQIUW|5|I use this seat base on a flat bottom jet boat, I regularly have to cross open water with 3-6 ft seas and this seat base works great, it never bottoms out and it is the best thing I have added to my boat
B005NFI8D8|5|I installed a complete set of Volar Kevlar disc pads on my Honda Valkyrie interstate (Front and Rear)and have had no problems. They have performed well even when wet. Smooth stopping. I paid $17.99 shipped on eBay. Total mileage so far around 5k and still look good. I would purchase them again. I do not race but would recommend the HH Sintered there.
B00J3LA2IC|4|This strap appears well-made, with inch-thick nylon and metal hooks.  I live in the desert where I've seen ATVers trapped due to engine malfunction or by being stuck in thick mud.  The low tow weight for this isn't very high, and thus I wonder of its safety when used as a tow strap for standard snowmobiles or ATVs.  Users should be careful of its applications before strapping this on.  This strap is better than having nothing at all in emergencies, but proceed with caution.
B00CDAFT6K|5|Great item!
B0000AUSC6|5|loved the patches and they seem to hold up very well with our cold climate too thanks amazon one more time you have proven your standards for great clients and wonderful products for consumers
B000WJX4BQ|5|just like my old one and worked perfect...thanks..got early then expected.thanks...
B00HPA58G4|5|Best of both worlds
B007OSL3DY|4|What can be said, it does what it suppose to do. I am surprised it took so many years for this Idea to come out.
B009NTEYXS|5|Keeps the factory lines, and function.  If you need a heavy duty hitch, this probably isn't what you are looking for.  5000lbs max.  For general duty towing, it works quite well, though.  Keep in mind that this does NOT come with the light kit.
B00MBA5VNS|4|I bought this light for my brother firefighter/roommate. and I pleased with the overall look and design, but soon after the installation, it started having issues. LEDs went out, the cord needs to not be a coil type, and LEDs have continued to burn out. I would recommend this as a starter light, but upgrade as soon as possible.
B0012MYI8U|5|This product is everything it claims to be. I have used the jump starter to get peoples car moving three times in the past 9 months. Does not sound like much, but it was great for those I helped and so much easier than a cable jump. The air compressor is also useful.<br />I do not know however how long the battery can remain charged, recharged plugged in. However since I am 83 yrs old, the point is moot
B000CB6ASI|5|as advertised
B00FBOJB00|5|Nice quality
B001EVQVJI|5|great
B00CUNVHEI|5|Wanted to try balancing beads because I like the concept of not having to rebalance your tires after a set amount of miles.  Also don't like the ugly wheel weights on the outside of my aluminum wheels plus it always seems wheel weights corrode the aluminum wheels leaving an appearance blemish.  So far so good....no shakes, car drives nice and smooth.
B005EJGSQ2|5|Sure made my cross country drive more bearable, hope it never wears out, cleaned up easy with mild soap solution
B001IGBIAG|5|It's was just what I expected! They work great!
B005FI51EM|5|Love the driver's license plate beautiful on our car love it love it five-star
B00OVUD2CS|5|nice quality
B000GU5OLE|5|Love these brakes, just bought a second set. I got about 5000 miles out of my last set; I am really aggressive on the brakes though. They are a huge improvement over the stock pads by the way.
B000XRHRZQ|5|Good inexpensive product delivered on time.
B002QTVLJW|5|The decal arrived quickly in the mail and is just as described in color and quality. They'd be great as greeting card inserts to fellow tenders of the 'mingo flock!
B00DQJ921K|5|Perfect fit Well made
B0018S1XRC|5|Got exactly what I needed in this roll bar strap! Unfortunately my extinguisher is a bit small for it, but the adjustable straps make it work. I wish there were measurements in the description, aside from the weight of the extinguisher, but again- the straps are adjustable so it's not a big deal! Straps fit the roll bar in my Wrangler TJ perfectly.  Definitely would recommend and purchase again if I ever need another.
B000M61JFC|4|I bought these because a fuse blew and I ended up purchasing a relatively(!) expensive replacement at Pep Boys. Considering this, I looked for some inexpensive replacement fuses and after looking at various sets decided on this one. I did not have any need for any fuses since so I can't comment on the quality. However, I put a couple of each into Ziploc bags and have them in the clove compartment in each vehicle.
B0002SRGFW|5|Trying to get the tie-rods out of my 2000 VW Jetta TDI was literally impossible until I got the tool.  I spent hours trying to come up with a way to remove (unscrew) them from the steering gear.  The factory shop manual (FSM) says to pull the steering gear out (tough job in itself) and then remove the tie rods from it using a vice.  The other option is to take it to a dealership and let them do it for $500, or more.  Get this tool.  Spend the money.  Once I got the tool and dropped the correct size adapter in the end, it took me about 45 seconds to pull each tie rod and install the new replacement unit.  The steering gear didn't need to be re-centered, purged, etc.  Add new tie-rod ends and then take it to be re-aligned.  I thought the tool was a lot of money when I first looked at it but it's cheap compared to paying someone else to do it and the job becomes child's play once you have it.  Save your money and a lot of time and frustration, get this tool.  It comes with a good selection of adapters so it should fit a wide variety of vehicles.
B001UFXSSK|5|worked awesome, my 84 s10 now corners way different. excellent!
B005ZZH7G0|5|Wanted some shorter mudflaps on the front of my truck that where also more sturdy. I have slightly taller than factory tires as well and after putting these on my tires do not scrub when I turn anymore.
B0013BI5KW|5|works and looks nice
B00LWTU1I4|5|Good tint, just make sure to peel both plastic sidrs off before use. Word count word count word count word count
B00O25CWZA|5|Fits great looks great.
B000I51KQA|5|they look absolutely terrific. would highly recommend to anyone that is looking to add alittle flare to their pick up. i bought them to add some light for when i pull out so people can see me pull out and i don't get t-boned. they look sick.
B00FLSG6V8|4|This works just fine to minimize the amount of mud and dirt that accumulates on the floor of my Honda Pilot.  I had to air out the mats because they have a strong plastic odor.  They're substantial enough weight-wise so I dont have to worry about a lot of shifting on the car floor.  I don't know yet if the shallow lip/grooves would be enough to catch melted snow, but so far so good with rain and mud.
B000C55T2M|1|If I could have I would have given it 0 stars, but they make me give it one! I purchased these in the past with great results, but these are junk! Both shocks leak air through the shotty welds! Very displeased!!!!
B003YK96VC|5|This step is the best thing for us older group and the install is quick and easy to install on my 2500 Ram there was no need the raise it up
B005345DBY|4|Very warm and long enough to  cover your entire neck without riding up.  It's a little tight on me and I think I have an average sized head.  It's going to make your hair a mess.
B000C9OUUK|5|exact size, shape as original equipment.
B000755JDQ|5|Easy installation.  Look good, and work well for vertically-impaired people.
B006G3W22O|5|Fit just right
B001B0XD6Q|5|NGK plugs are great. I have not, and will not use another plug on my equipment that calls for NGK
B0002UQAXY|5|love it
B000CQBM5Y|5|5 minutes to install. A worthwhile replacement to those rubbish vacuum hubs they designed for the kia sportage 03
B000OUZBTQ|5|Does what an oil filter wrench is supposed to do.
B001HBMKCC|3|Outstanding
B00B8X63RC|5|Sliped right onto the clutch pedal and stays in place very well.  Matches the factory accelerator and brake pad I have in the truck currently so it was nice to not have to replace all of them for a matching set.
B007UHPVX2|5|I love it! I finally have the beautiful matching car seat & steering wheel cover I have looked & waited almost a year to find
B005NXMFW0|5|I love this cover!!  I bought it because my dog was scratching the plastic when she would stand on it.  I now have the added benefit of it being cushioned when I rest my arm on it.
B00BD4EYD6|5|pretty comfy boots for what they are.  a compromise between full motocross boots and street boots. all my other boots are sidi street and race boots with much thinner and more flexible soles.  takes a bit of familiarization.  in sidi's i wear a size 49 euro.  in alpinestars, i wear size 48.  alpinestars fit a bit wider than sidi's.  personally, i think that i'd still prefer a slightly thinner sole.  the fact that in regular shoes, i wear barefoot type shoes (vivobarefoot) probably has something to with the desire for more feel.  another con: the boots noticeably squeak (noisy)  while walking.<br /><br />overall construction appears excellent.  i prefer this style to sidi adventure boots -though, i'd lose the large alpinestars logo in the front/top of boots.  gore-tex waterproof always works great, is pricy and breathes better than probably anything else on the market.  until something better appears, this is probably the best adventure boot on the market.  get'em.  recommended.<br /><br />update -- february 23, 2014:<br />i upped the rating from 4 stars to five stars.  i've put more than 1000 miles on the boots and i love'em.  i fixed the squeaking by applying lube to the joints. i've gotten used the lack of feel compared my thinner soled sidi boots. these are my got to boots.  i've walked in snow, mud, ice and water.  they keep my feet dry and warm.  more importantly, i crashed the boots in a slow speed lowside and though i landed on the buckles and slid on the asphalt, the metal buckles worked perfectly despite the gouges. the goodyear welt stitching offered additional protection because to accommodate the stitching, the sole sticks out from the body of the boots.  i.e., i landed on the sole before the toe box touched the ground.  outstanding.<br /><br />great looking, outstanding protection from crashes and the elements, irreproachable quality, comfortable... what's not to love. totally worth the price -especially since i expect that i'll have these for many years.  highly, highly recommended.
B00QRTW9DY|5|Honestly, I thought I was gonna get a cheaply made setup, but after it arrived, I was excited. The box was battered, but other then that everything but the blue hose is included. Your gonna need extra tubing to connect the two air hoses and a hose clamp. One will act as an adapter and the other just needs to be  a bit longer. The whole install took me roughly an hour tops. The straight bracket will act as a support, and a zip tie will run through the two holes and wrap around the intake tube. It makes an amazing engine roar driving also. Im only 17, and was able to install this by myself. Thumbs up for sure!
B004ALM1LG|5|You will notice a night and day difference from poly urethane and OEM rubber.  I put them on a 1995 240sx se Nissan and it improved the ride characteristics drastically.  The car doesn't &#34;jump&#34; around when encountering bumps and less body roll when cornering.  One notice in the handling is that the front end seems to plant better in the corner than the rear does, so now when I corner hard, the rear of the car seems to break traction first.  Before the upgrade, it was the front that would lose traction first.  I don't think it is a bad product.  It just changed the handling of the car this much.  I am very happy with the install.  I upgraded both front and rear sway bar bushings and end-links at the same time.
B004T1FXYO|5|Great Price... Good Quality... OEM Fitment...
B002QGVWBW|5|Great  battery.<br />Works great would buy again.
B003UM7B98|5|Solid jack. No cons as far as I'm concerned.
B00EN7JPIO|5|The Creader VIII is well made with a very good screen display. So far, it has done everything as advertised. A couple of reviews said it is not well made and would not function properly until you update it. Well duhhhhh, that's why they want you to update it prior to use, so you have the latest firmware and model information. This scan tool connects super fast and reads live data stream almost instantaneously.<br /><br />Prior to updating the scanner, you will have to figure out how to change the language from Chinese to whatever you need. There are a few Youtube videos available showing how to do that (pretty simple). Then go online to the website listed in the owners manual for updating. My first three update attempts failed to complete successfully, but the fourth attempt completed successfully.
B000VU56IA|5|This mat is heavy and thick. I have a fiberglass cap on the back of my pickup which means I have to crawl on my knees to get things out of the back. That hard metal truck bed was rough on my knees. This mat is thick enough to give a comfortable cushion on my knees. It also keeps things from sliding around in the back of the truck. It was well worth the money and I'm glad I got it.
B001KN6E24|5|Needed it for the Honda Pilot, other one ripped.  Perfect fit for the back, great to keep valuables out of sight.
B005DOQYNU|5|Great
B000MT7OSK|3|Good Goggles if you don't were Glasses I ordered them because the said that goggles would fit over glasses yes if your 2 years old
B002ZBY9HW|5|works great. have used for years. never had problems. life saver.
B000E3EWGQ|5|I gave them to my daughter and she tells me that she \\"absolutely adores them and cannot wait to get the matching seat covers\\"
B000GTYAME|1|We ordered this belt and it lasted one day.  After pulling the ATV home we checked the belt and all that was left were strings holding it together, the rest was nothing but dust. I would not recomend this to anyone. If you don't wanna walk home buy a better belt.
B008Y3P0TQ|5|Works just fine!!
B009PIKHYW|5|Fit and finish is great! I have the original factory floor mats as well as the factory all weather floor mats. The main reason I bought these floor mats is because the factory floor mats don't cover the drivers side dead pedal/foot rest, and they didn't cover all of the carpet up front.Though both of the factory floor mats fit nicely, they didn't offer that much protection to my Escapes new carpet. This product solved both of the issues and provided even more coverage to the back. The drivers side floor mat does not use the factory retention snaps, but I have not noticed any slippage due to the carpet grippers on the bottom of all the mats. These are pricey, but I'm glad I purchased them.
B001FCB4JS|5|worked great sealing up my Rv
B001J5ZP1Y|5|I bought this to use on my friends 1994 Dodge B350 and it fit and worked perfectly.  Good quality, great price.
B0006H7ZV4|5|Easy to install, perfect fit, looks good
B004TR4B7S|5|After fooling around with crummy filter wrenches for a couple of hours, I bought this wrench.  In under fifteen seconds, I had the large filter loose, even with all the damage to the filter from the other wrenches.  This was one of the best tool purchases I have made in a long time.
B007S0LHUM|5|fast delivery, package very well, as described and easy to install.
B001Y8NEX2|5|works great, very easy to use
B004EDF8HY|4|Easy to install, make my LED turn signals work.  Larger than I thought they would be but I think they are pretty much the standard size.  They do get warm when the blinker is on but nothing extreme, just zip tied them to my motorcycle frame and have had no problems yet.
B00DR14U0K|4|ok material
B00C4XFMO0|5|good
B006IDFEV8|5|I love this new look to my FZ6R, it was really easy to connect once i figured it out. Where the screw enters the light. It isnt predrilled so u want to drill the screws in 1st before u get it installed. Dont do like i did & get to the end & have to reinstall it...lol. I also purchased the Yamaha 2008-2013 FZ6R Fender Eliminator separately since it cost less the the whole kit. I'll write a review for the Fender Eliminator next ---Jountia (Lady Rider)
B006ODTR6U|5|I was pleasantly surprised when I received the CRV luggage cross bars. They were in fact original OEM parts as advertised. The shipment was on time and complete. They're installed and working as expected. I'm happy that I was able to save $ and did not have to sacrifice quality.
B00062YZZS|5|Bought this for our 2003 BMW R 1150R.<br /><br />Even as a female I understand that Mobil 1 is THE standard for synthetic, and we would never buy another brand for any of our engines.
B000CITK8S|5|This works great, what else is there to say. I dont have any hard numbers but if you want a small reliable charger to keep up batteries that are not used often this is for you
B002RW244Y|3|The design of this piece for the Tundra is pathetic in my opinion. It is not easy to get the thing on to where you feel it won't come off. You have to guarantee you align the circle portion on the back of the wedge with the hole so that the knob thread will contact it for proper clamping. It is not a guarantee of it staying on because of that and the rather flexible plastic shell. The ridges on the mirror portion itself forming a 'groove' for the wedge are too shallow to keep it in place while putting it on so it becomes a battle. Seems it would be better to have something like two velcro straps that would wrap around the mirror on the open end to secure it and making install easier and also if the ridges were higher to keep the wedge in the proper position. The mirror piece is not a real mirror (at least not in any real sense of what you a mirror to be) so don't expect any picture perfect view - it's adequate. I would not buy these again because I find it a meticulous pain in the butt to put them on and know they are on to stay. I'm an engineer and I hate inadequate engineering.
B00M5G2US2|5|Good
B0016XFZRS|1|I was looking for a spotlight type of flashlight that could really throw out a beam. This one really disappointed me with its performance. The light doesn't seem that bright to me. I have a smaller LED flashlight whose light is brighter with better reach. The only reason I would keep this light is because it's rechargeable.
B0049CHXDW|5|This little guy is excellent for locking up your trailer hitch.
B0050VH4SA|4|They look great, but gives less light than orinigales and it is impossible to read something.  thanks from Costa Rica
B004IA92FM|5|Nice
B00AWXHQTI|3|poor fit for my 2013 XTS.
B00BLZ4KRW|5|Good quality and excellent price even with shipping cost.  The rotors even had the holes for the safety screw that most other rotors I have seen do not include
B0040YW29E|5|I purchased this for the front hitch on my Jeep..I thought the look complimented my Jeep..It was easy to order and arrived on time..I would recommend it to anyone with a Jeep to use on front or back hitch..
B002K2FS8K|4|Went on easy. Covers nicely. Like the zippers since we still camp through the winter.  Easy access and cover back up.
B005NLQAHS|5|Great product that allows me to read/clear trouble codes and change a multitude of customizations when paired to my Android phone with the Carista app. I'm using this on my 2014 Toyota Prius.
B005CRE2K0|5|Great product for the price!!! It is of top quality and even better you get two! Great for Hello Kitty fans!
B000V526FQ|2|Installs easy. That's fabulous. However these lasted me exactly 3 years. I'm in San Jose, and if anyone is from around here, they know we've been in a drought this whole time. What does that have to do with these strut kits? This thing should last more than 3 years in amazing climate, no salt on the road, and very little moisture.
B000WEKPKE|5|I bought these for my dad's car. Very easy instructions to follow and quick install. He is very pleased, that is all that matters.
B00D260FI6|4|Over all it is a product that can work I added some hard Teflon washer so that I can keep it tight and still usable with out the wobbly Ness
B0042OX8VS|2|The 99 Toyota Corolla needed a three-way switching valve near the charcoal canister at the rear axle.  I should have taken a closer look at the old on before ordering this part.
B000DCOMSQ|5|This product is excellant for your shimming needs.  And it will not rot, crack or otherwise fall apart as wooden shims do.
B004VPNX2M|4|These are very nice covers. Only problem is they are made to fit seat with all removable headrests. Otherwise a great fit.
B000RUG0IY|5|Much better than stock.  Put these babies in my 09 Triumph Tiger and can see much better compared to the crappy stock lamps.
B00CNEP394|5|Excellent quality & finish. Extremely fast delivery. Very good description.<br />I got what I bought based on the information given by the seller. I would<br />buy again from this seller.
B005DXNKU6|5|This is very well built unit. I am a rock hound and able to collect my treasures to haul home easily.  At home it carries all my yard work tools without spills with perfect height of side rails.
B007Q8LVL6|3|Such a nice jacket and really one of a kind. Disappointed about the size, the XL is really much bigger than the nomal XL and I cannot believe that the size difference is that big for USA sizes. The waist is straight down and not like the picture, forming around the waist area.<br />Difficult to give it a star rating, 5 stars for the look, 1 star for size.
B000ZASNEU|2|This order we received was not a complete set for our Mustang. It only included cover for bottom of back seat and cover for one front seat. Forgot about contacting them because it was a birthday gift in January so now its too late to return items. A clearer description for what items you will receive is needed.
B001UR5XCW|3|Very usefull...
B00BGZ4QCG|5|shipped as promised, came in perfect condition.  will order again in the future if any other of my cars needs.
B008TECLSI|4|I accidentally attempted to drive off...totally forgetting it was locked on my front driver's side wheel. It instantaneously bent the hallow steel arm 90 degrees. The grip portion of the device remained firmly attached, and the locking mechanism remained in tact as well. As I put it in drive and pressed on the accelerator, the car slowly volleyed forward, like the emergency brake was on or the feeling I was going over a steep speed bump. I went for about 5 feet before saying &#34;oh s*** the lock!&#34;.<br /><br />In my opinion I feel a criminal could slowly drive off with this lock still on. Once the hallow steel arm is bent, the grip portion of the device just revolves around with the tire and scrapes the inside of the wheel well. This device definitely will not stop a determined theif who needs to drive it around the corner out of view. But it will definitely hinder them.<br /><br />Besides my ego and the embarrassed look on my face, nothing else was damaged. The rim, tire, brakes and cv boot were all undamaged luckily. I only had this device for about 1 week. I'd recommend buying a bright colored steering wheel cover or something to put over the gear shifter as a reminder that you need to unlock the wheel lock before you put it in drive.<br /><br />Besides my error, the device held up pretty decent with about 2 revolutions of my wheel in drive. To eventually take the mangled wheel lock off, I had to deflate the tire and jack the car up to releve pressure from the device that was pressing against both the tire and asphalt. Once it was jacked up, it was easy to unlock and take off with little effort or strength.
B0093RRSXS|5|Excellent product - worked exactly as it was suppose to, excellent price!
B000EOKT3K|1|CVV  did not fit the stated car model that  it said it fits to &#34;my jetta 2006&#34;, nor did the ring it was too short.<br />I only discovered it trying to fit it in,
B000N8KDI8|1|These have gotta be made it some backwoods Chinese shop the holes do not line up very well.<br />if I were to do it again I would buy a different brand most definitely!
B000S2SSPO|5|i ordered wrong part
B000GZAUQ8|5|Great plugs. I saved abt 80 cad buying fr Amazon.
B00LPNJCLY|4|would have liked a little better fit.  The bottoms fit but could have been better.
B001TYJOG2|4|Good fit, and I like the look & color scheme. It was a small wrestling match to get the fit right & secure them, but they have been there for about 2 & half years showing good durability. Still looking fine
B001LNJYA2|5|The plate has a great look to it.  Previously I had a mirrored plate that someone hit and broke and this looks better and will hold up to most anything as it is stainless steel.
B009DTH8A4|5|Best buy i've had in quite a while  looks awesome beyond what i was expecting.... Gonna buy from again for my husbands truck!!!!!
B005N6YNQ8|5|Great shirt. Totally rocks.
B002D33QBW|2|I have this in white and bought in chrome. White is great. The chrome had metal type pieces on paper to install. Part of sticker. One fell off right away. The sticker is not staying on car. I know how to install. It must be chrome color. My white was is perfect on other car. Nice color, just won't buy another chrome one...
B004VMW28Q|2|I thought this was listed as a jumbo size and pick because I have a large/deep window however very small and won't stay up with visors.
B005G5HBCY|5|Great replacement pieces for the OEM adjuster blocks that can crack.  Previous owner of my bike must have cranked down too hard on the axle nut, as the threaded OEM block cracked.  I replaced it easily with this kit.  Looks great and the adjuster setup is nice.  Great touch that they include the little square nut tool for unthreading your OEM block.  I also was happy to see the copious amounts of never-seize already on the bolts and covered with black plastic end caps on the adjuster threads.<br /><br />Quality product!
B0007TBP0I|5|Great looking plate frame. It is our second one for our new car. WeatherTech is a great brand - high quality.
B00BJNT670|5|Correct part. Came in timely manner.
B00IO3KQPO|1|I was extremely disappointed. It was so heavy, no give like honey comb gel seat cushions so a lot of pressure on body. Got very hard and heavy during cold weather. Company info. very misleading.Way too expensive...to ship back was also a lot of money then got charged restocking fee of 20%. Disabled people search these items out and to charge so much is irresponsible. Brookstone sold a much better product at half price and unconditional returns.
B0031XXW4O|5|Gives me more room and I was suprised at how well it's constructed.
B00881LMSC|3|plenty of hardware (more than needed). No instruction, but one can figure it out easily.. for the third hole for mounting the rear ones, i poked a hole in the plastic and just screwed one of the provided screws in it. They look good, except I wish they were slightly larger... they maybe extend an inch or so below the car..
B00104AG90|4|Got it in a timely fashion, was a little thin and got bent in the mail but for the price can't beat it. Was glad to see Made in the USA. in small letters at the bottom and not &#34;made in China&#34;  wouldn't that piss ya off.
B00B9XDJQO|5|One of the best brake fluid you can buy. Made in Germany.
B0009IQX90|5|this stuff is great esp. for the price. I use it for clay lubrication and for quick removal of bugs & bird droppings.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|I have owed these lights for over a month now. Installed all four on the sport bar of my 2013 Tacoma. They are made in China so I was really skeptic at first but after install..Amazing!! really clear bright (blinding) white lights!!. For the price, I know I made a great investment. If you are looking for a good Flood or Work light then I highly recommend this to you. This will not disappoint.  But if you are looking for a SPOT Light that goes over 30 ft. then look somewhere else because the descriptive title on top can be deceiving.  Hope this helps.
B000HA9O5A|5|works well
B009FU77ZM|4|Nice shocks for a 4thGen 4Runner's front end.<br />They ride well and are very responsive to the road or whatever you're crawling.
B00DWWV4UI|5|Every time I get a new car the first improvement I make is to drop in a K&N air filter.<br /><br />The performance gain really is significant. On most cars you can get a 3 to 5 horsepower gain.<br /><br />Why is that? Well, car manufacturers use cheap air filters because it lets them shave $40 off the manufacturing price. But don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that savings is being passed on to you.<br /><br />Stock air filters are usually made out of paper. It's not even good paper. It's the kind of paper cardboard is made out of.<br /><br />In addition to that level of suck, many vehicle manufacturers are now adding a layer of foam rubber on top of the air filter, especially in small engines and especially small engines with forced induction (I'm looking at you, Fiat and Dodge) because the air filter itself is so crappy it doesn't actually filter out all of the particles in the air.<br /><br />K&N air filters are made from wire mesh and a fabric membrane with a little oil added to catch dirt particles.<br /><br />To make a sensible comparison, try holding a paper towel up to your face and inhaling.<br /><br />Okay, next try holding a flour sifter up to your face and inhaling.<br /><br />Which method allowed you to get the most air?
B007KPUFIK|5|I needed to match my shifter pegs to my grips and finally found this here. With a little locktite it works great on my 1990 HD.
B0093CADC6|4|The cradle works great. The only issue that I have found is there isn't enought room for the power cable for the Garmin powered mount w/speaker. This was easy to correct with a Dremmel and 2 mins.
B009F27EQ2|5|Parts was easy to install. Works like new. Great.The Best price on net. If you have been shopping, look no further.
B007RRMVA6|5|The color goes with my car very well. Using this paint, I fixed some dents perfectly. I like the paint.
B000Z0HVHA|5|I used this on a long road trip when our center back console plug in didn't work anymore. The kids where happy with their electronics.
B00I7XSVGC|4|The sun zapper works really well for that blinding sun while you are driving.  There are some &#34;waves&#34; in the plastic, but your eyes adjust easily.  I have a fairly thin, narrow visor in my convertible, so the clip tends to slip on the more narrow side.  For a thicker visor, it is good for that blinding morning or evening sun in your face.
B001R8ZS6A|5|Best baby on board sticker there is. Easy to apply to my or any vehicle and glad to get rid of the old yellow one that everyone has.
B001F7CG04|4|Denso makes good quality O2 sensors.  The ones in my Nissan Titan were past due for replacement and this ficed it up.  Don't be afraid to try - you will save $$$ by doing it yourself.
B00267PXOS|4|I bought one before and it lasted about a year before the hydraulic gave up. I use it in my garage to work on my motorcycle. It is what it is for the money. You want better quality? spend more money, otherwise it's a 4 star item.
B0009IQZH0|4|Good product for a reasonable price
B008IGS2GC|5|Perfectly as described. Fit a 2007 Prius as expected, slotted right in place and removed the old carpets.
B0001EWLPW|4|Nice
B005EMK03G|5|I was looking for something to hold a regular box of tissues as I never seem to be able to reach them when I need one.  I have this hanging on the front passenger seat to hold my extra glasses, GPS, cords, and a snack bar.  I love the tissue box on top as it holds a regular large size of tissues (no looking for special thin boxes.)  If someone is going to sit in the front, I just push it around so it hangs on the back of the seat with no problem.
B0007A0EUO|1|This actually made my truck run worse,It made my truck have a slight hesitation at take off. The nice thing is you can take it off in about five minutes.
B00353PWAW|3|The product is very thick and smells very nice, creates a good amount of suds. I washed a black car and a gold car, the gold car came out excellent, shiny, almost \\"polished\\". The black car came out OK but I noticed more scratching than before wash and it left some streaking. Next time I'm just going to wash the black car then wax it separately with a black car formula wax.
B0030UXG76|5|Put these on a 2008 Jeep Wrangler sahara Unlimited.  Look great! Nice fit and nice upgrade to the fenders.  came with a lot of pieces for mounting.  Ended up not doing it myself and having my mechanic install.  There were very detailed instructions so if you had the time to do it could be a do it yourself project.  Took mechanic couple hours to install.  Highly recommend these and Amazon had a very competitive price at the time of my purchase.
B000IBU9QG|2|Initially, it was perfect! But then the nylon keeping the beeds together started tearing off after 2 weeks. Will not buy this brand again.
B000C5SG54|5|I bought (2) sensors for my 2001 Toyota Tundra. These are the ones in front of the CAT. The sensors fit perfect and once I got the plug apart ( I sprayed with wd40) it was easy. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B0021USOM8|5|Just the trick for removing the oil feed lines on the early 6.0 powerstroke. A must have if you work on these engines.
B004ALFXR0|5|as described no problems
B0057FK08A|5|Exact fit, direct replacement.  Literally took 2 minutes to remove old filter and install new one, appears to work great.
B00BYH6C1E|3|Gimmicky.  Does not stay in place. Does keep things from falling through the gap but so would a rolled up towel. Would not waste the money again.
B00G3KI0PS|5|Bright
B0062BHOOG|5|Perfect gadget. this Digital Tire Pressure Gauge is just easy to use ether during the day or at night. would recommend it any time.
B00C1M0C7Q|5|Great!
B007R4UQG0|5|This is a great small keychain for a Miata owner.  It is not bulky and matches my red Miata. The quality and feel are great as well.
B00AQKC7LO|5|Works great wish the wires were a little longer
B00062Z0IE|4|good products
B00BFEXACA|5|This is a great light! I bought them and I put them in my truck and they're bright! Had a little problems with the suction cups but fixed it easy! GREAT PRODUCT! I would recommend this to a friend.<br />Also fast shipping!! I didn't expect it to come this quick!.
B001LHVOVK|5|Have had this OBDll unit for  2 years and it has worked well on both American and Japanese Cars.<br /><br />It is inexpensive and functional.
B006TMK134|1|bad service, the piece is not
B000CFQ34A|5|1992 Buick LeSabre with 320,000+ miles.  Overloaded with work-related equipment.  Probably could use new springs, and shocks.  Stiffened ride right up and helped with the ride height of the sagging rear-end.
B00G09675W|5|Fits perfectly on my 2006 MCS.  I've had my Mini for four years and I've had four of these damn things fall off. The first three times I went to the dealership and they said they had to replace the entire center cap, which was like $24. Really glad these lil guys were available.
B006X3Q3JK|5|I bought these gloves for motorcycle purposes. The gloves aren't too thick or thin and are very soft inside. I live in Brazil where everything is ridiculously expensive (no way I could by similar gloves with inferior quality here for less than U$ 80) so U$ 23.96 for these gloves is a wonderful price. I actually bought two pairs.
B00O3PCTUW|5|Gteat product and service.
B007EEVLDU|5|Perfect fit! and good price
B0065263IU|3|I only gave this product three stars because it is very hard on the butt. I do have to say it is convenient for the motercycle that does not have a backseat already on it. Another thing I did not like about it is that it kinda slides around a bit, but not too bad. Out of products like this I would have to say it is probably the best. After all it is just a removable temporary seat!
B000W8FMQ2|5|This is great.  I use it about twice a week on a car that the manufacturer can't seem to fix.  It holds a charge very well and so far has always started my car.
B003TSRXNC|5|Thank you so much. I get this for a dad present. He don't know yet and didn't see yet. But I like and looks so awesome and comfortable.
B005R4LJ9A|5|I love the look and design. Instructions on line were easy to understand and follow. Just unplug the original one and plug in the new ; no wire cutting at all.
B000WJ7KQ6|5|I have long hair and find this item ideal for keeping it from getting tangled and knotted.  I find it very easy to use.  Just put your hair in a low ponytail with an elastic band, and then hook the glove on the under side of the band.  Use both hand to tuck your hair in and snap the band around starting at the top and snap one at a time.  Easy enough to use that I can put in on anywhere.  Simpler then braiding and keeps my hair from breaking.  I would highly recommend.
B0002SRCYM|5|Very dependable and easy to use tool
B002E343F4|5|freaken EVAP codes can go to hell. Still didn't fix the problem.<br />I felt like every car dealerships' service shop,,, just start swaping out parts. - lol<br />Well I leased a car after this endless trail.<br /><br />I assume this worked as I got a diff code after it was installed the purge valve and said that's it<br />I'm not going any further after changing the Mass Sensor, Knock Sensor, Evap Purge.. (I still loved that 97 I30)
B004HNT4WQ|5|The Club 3000 is terific, I thought because the  steering wheel was small that it would not work but it did and I'm very happy with it.
B0000ATZCE|5|It is a quality cable lock.  I really like it.
B002LYQALQ|5|just perfect and goes everywhere I need
B005V67NC6|5|Both this front car plate as a gift for a recent graduate of GT.<br /><br />She wanted a plate that said she was now an alumni---this was the best one I found.  Also, the recipient loved the item.
B002XL9FTQ|5|exactly what I needed to fix the door on my RV fuse box
B000AMAE36|3|I purchased these for a Honda accord 2006 and knew beforehand that the angle of the connector was straight instead of 90 degrees.  That was not a big deal for me because the harness wiring had some slack so it could have reached.  My problem is that the diameter of the bulb base itself is larger than the original 9006 bulb so it could not fit in the bulb holder... Buyers ensure that the entire model number is compatible with your car! Not all 9006 bulbs are the same size..
B000FPZ3UW|5|Well I don't know how much I am saving on gas ? But as far peromance is much better . I love the sound too .
B002EA9IOS|5|Never again will I purchase bulbs for a vehical before I check the price on Amazon I got both headlight assemblies for the price of 4 bulbs and my truck looks like new again.
B001RB83G4|5|Looks awesome on my car! Easy application too 😃 very happy with it! Go GMen!!!
B0002KKVKC|4|Use this for my garage door opener, big hinges/spring on my fence door.  Not too oily or greasy, smells okay too.<br />Even threw some on my kids' tricycles and they don't squeak anymore - now they can sneak up on squirrels like ninjas
B0048J01RG|5|Bought the no-name brands before, they only lasted one season.  This one is the real OEM part.  Works great, very fast up-n-down.
B004BYDAH6|5|Great Product!!! Big fan of Top Gear UK and USA!!! and always loved the Stig. The application was easy and only took me 10 mins to install and looks great on my car, get compliments every where I go and some Confused looks lols but all in all very satisfied with everything fast shipping, Cheap Price, Easy to install, and Most importantly looks great!!!
B005P7CJH0|4|Looks fantastic but little more challenging to install than the youtube video demonstrated. Put this on my Browning A-bolt rifle and despite the handful of small creases, I'm overall happy with the look. A lot cheaper than buying the camo stock version from the manufactures.
B001TI5IIQ|5|Couldnt believe how good this stuff is, first off it was yellow, a few seconds later after using the first solution they give you, and BAM! That yellow was gone and here came the clear!
B009D3ZHDU|5|The dashmat looks nice, but I wish they would invent better stuff to stick it down with. It wasn't easy.
B002G47GE6|5|Just like, if not better, than the originals! Don't know what more to say other than Amazon's requirement for more words is just silly!
B00COYNVPQ|4|It fits &#34;well&#34; but this Texas heat is making it expand a little too quickly.  It has already began to slide on its own but it still looks good.
B004QJ0YHK|5|The bar looks good and has a nice finish.  The instructions were good and installation was easy.<br />I would buy this again
B000NSHRPK|5|very good part!!!!
B005DLQ9ME|5|They are great but they sent 2 sets and I am waiting for them to sent papers for me to return the other set at their expense. Been waiting a month!!! Better not charge me for the extra set!
B008G2CSSG|5|I have a 1997 Dodge 1500 Ram Sport Pick-up and these tailgate cables fit perfectly, buy the set of them you'll be happy you did... The quality of the product is better than the OEM, Both ends are sealed up well...<br /><br />Shipping was fast... On my door in 3 working days... Happy Happy Happy
B00GN2KW0C|2|This does not come with the correct adapter pipe. Ad says 35mm Inlet, but it was closer to 25mm.  Also the &#34;TEXTURED&#34; finish is a vinyl wrap only. Not really a quality piece at all.
B00QOJW62Q|5|These are 100 times better then the polaris brand ones, i had them and threw them in the trash and tried these, glad i did, they hold way better.
B00JIEX722|5|Pure bright white! Not a hint of blue. Exactly how i wanted them.
B0065J3368|2|I bought this gauge because it had received a lot of good reviews. I wanted something that would allow me get readings on hard-to-reach stems on my motorcycle wheels and thought this might work. It does find the stem, all right, but it gave faulty readings on the motorcycle tire and then on two truck tires. The battery was working, I got numbers and a voice telling me I had &#34;zero PSI,&#34; but all three tires were inflated to within a couple of lbs of what's specified, so clearly there was pressure to be found. Looks like I got a lemon. Won't try this brand again.
B001W3OL2M|5|got for a friend he loves it
B004PXAUGC|5|very good
B003IJU8HU|1|I have purchased cheesy relays with there connector before and I got exactly what i paid for. However I am at the point of wiring the electric fuel pump on my Jeep project,  so I paid the extra $$$ to get a relay assembly that could carry its weight in the daily torture of  its life. I had two choices the one from Mr.Gasket or the one from Painless, being a professional mechanic of over 40 years and working on a Heritage Nitro funny car team, I assumed Mr.Gasket would be acceptable! I was wrong!!! This product is just as bad as the cheap ones, they use 20 gauge wire on all of its connections. Hey Mr.Gasket I got news for you the relay will work OK, but someone forgot to tell you that small of wires will burn up far before they have to carry any current. IF YOUR WANTING A RELAY AND HARNESS THAT CAN CARRY ANY CURRENT DO NOT BUY THIS!!! IT IS REAL APPARENT WHEN THE MANUFACTURING WENT TO WHAT EVER COUNTRY FOR ASSEMBLY THEY CUT MAJOR $$$ OFF BY USING CHEAP, MIS-RATED WIRES JUST TO MOVE THE PRODUCT AND ASSUMED KNOW ONE WOULD CATCH ON, WRONG!
B00MALO58A|5|I repainted but exelent product
B000EDUUGM|5|I was able to replace my old one through a search on Amazon. The delivery and ready to use  was a great replacement.
B00PYFVOEW|3|There are no holes for the buckles in the back seat and I'm pretty sure I installed the back seat covers wrong because I just could not figure them out from the directions. The front seat covers went on easily and fit my Sonata really well. I've had them for about 5 months now and they've held up well - even with my two big dogs in the car.
B0083YDKG6|4|The lights look great, and fit just like factory. The grill has some fitment issues so the lines aren't perfect once installed, but that's what you get with aftermarket. Overall quality and styling is good.
B004I3MGRK|5|I have been a heavy equipment mechanic for over 30 yrs. and anytime I can order a part to repair a piece of equipment I do it and  have saved and used the money I would have spent to have it repaired to build on to my retirement.The item that I purchased was identical as the part that was not working, and the item was ordered regular freight but came two days prior to expectation. will not hesitate ordering again.
B0066A2B4Q|5|Excellent
B00FNXBTMC|5|New battery arrived in good condition and fit in the prior position. Have not checked its capacity, but had a short power outage and it worked properly.
B000C9QU6W|5|works well.  I use it for the idiot light on my street rod. It is an 1/8&#34; NPT thread, so it fits right into SBC.
B0024NSMAG|3|Look great when you get them but, don't let them get wet or cold... fog up and are useless.
B000EBMK9Y|4|The colors were prefect for my car, blues and grays.  The soft velvet gives it a touch of richness.  The image is pretty, but could be a little better quality and well with the embordary.  Over all I am happy I got it.
B004ME11FS|5|Good product and fast delivery
B000WJ5HA2|5|A gift to my brother - &#34;he loved it&#34; and 2  years later it's still holding strong (keeps bike outside covered with this product). So I'd say this is a &#34;great&#34; product.
B007YWO29C|4|this lamp is very bright ( compare to other 7440 LED lamp I bought), but still not as bright as stock lamp. I contact them for return and very quick response. I will buy from this company again.
B001NL0BQI|5|Prefect for what I need working on a farm buy it now back ba ba ba ba fill in space
B000EDOSRY|5|Pops off too much
B004QEKG8C|4|very lite  seems sturdy enough we will see
B004R35HEA|5|perfect!
B0060YHP12|4|Its a solid cloth washer for batteries it has two size, or an insert for Japanese batteries.  I would buy again for the price.
B009IPD5UA|4|Good stuff
B0022ZI0JY|5|I used this to remove the dealer sticker they put on the car and it did a great job in not scatching the metal.
B003XGYDE2|4|I have had this product in use for almost two months now, and it has fit the bill.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that the gauge for the air pressure is off by 3-5 psi (too high), so I have to remember to slightly over-inflate and then check the pressure with the precision air pressure gauge.  Otherwise, it is a good value and I recommend it.
B00GP95WLM|1|Disappointed, ,,,i purchased it for my fog lights  and only one of them looks nice and brite ,,,the other looks just like the halogen bulb that i had... when i turn it on  both looks fine ,,,,for 5 seconds then the intensity dramatically die on one of them  looking like a halogen bulb :(
B007T6QSTU|5|Works great.
B00CI934QS|3|I got this for my boyfriend who is a major Kingdom Hearts fan and I thought he would love it. He liked it but only thing is that it was really small, I had thought it would have been bigger but it was small kind of like a sticker. Overall I gave it three stars because my boyfriend did like it just I knew he would have loved it if it was bigger.
B0002RQ3V6|5|Great product as listed. Fast shipping ! Thanks !
B006G14FK8|5|UPDATE:  I've had this for over a year now and I've used it many times on my old Celica (that sits in the garage a lot). This unit (the CTEK MUS 4.3) is great. It works flawlessly every time I use it. I recommend this product.    Original review:  I had problems with two other battery chargers from Schumacher. One worked intermittently for a few years and then died. The other arrived DOA, and I returned it. I was looking for an alternative to Schumacher when I came across the CTEK products. I read a bunch of reviews and this MUS 4.3 is somewhat more expensive than I wanted to pay, but I bought it anyway and I like it a lot. I've used it three times so far, and it works exactly as described in the user documentation. In addition to the great performance, it seems very well made. I'm impressed.
B003G0O1JC|5|The liners were a perfect fit.  I have owned 3 vehicles and have purchased husky liners for each of them.  They are well worth the money you spend.
B0024ECHII|3|Unless you want to modify it (I cut a center section out and welded it back together. ) be sure you have enough space for it between the step and ground.  Otherwise it's pretty good to stabilize the steps.
B00JGE2PUE|4|Simple and works. I have seen ones with a notch just in case. This one is fine for me.
B0009TAOBW|5|All Good
B000CMHNY2|5|Perfect fit
B006XG5FJQ|5|This is a great lamp for the money, it had minor and I mean really minor imperfections but I'm way too picky about stuff that doesn't really matter sometimes.<br /><br />I mounted an HID unit in mine and its hasn't had a single issue since its gone in. the wave cut pattern gave me a decent cutoff line for headlight adjustment so I'm pretty happy so far.<br /><br />The coolness factor is high, the tri-bar and black dot look great even when the light isn't on. I wouldn't have a problem recommending this to anyone who is looking to bump up the look of the front end a bit.<br /><br />The halogen bulb that comes with it is an upgrade over stock as well although I did not use it.
B00AR11AN8|5|Buy as a birthday give for a friend of my and he like it. He install it on a vw golf and it dose looks good.
B001N7QSNC|4|This work great and they were at a good price.  I had another pair of these but I scratched the lens.  It would be nice if they just had more replacements.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00CHDJB0S|5|It came quick in the mail and it fit just right.
B00A9ZA1GO|5|A cool looking leather wrapped drink holder.  Gimbals well when tooling down the road. Easy to mount almost anywhere. One!
B0002STSBM|5|I received it quick and it perfect shape. This in my opinion is the best! If your looking for a spark tester this is it.
B000C7Y7YG|5|This sensor provides an additional 5* of base timing advance.  It's recommended for high altitudes but can provide a few hp and better mpg at lower altitudes provided you use higher octane gas.  Good ole Jeep tricks.
B000NN5V1M|5|This is a very well built and smooth operating piece of equipment.  It is very versatile offering infinite adjustment and easy modification if needed to shorten (I did).  Wish more tools were this quality!
B0046ID5EK|3|All functions work as they should, but, within a shorter distance from the vehicle that the new Original equipment key fob.
B000BWAK48|1|I received this product on time as expected.  Once I tried to install it in the car I noticed the rotor was cracked, the cap was O.K.  I wrote a complain about it to Amazon and was given three options on of those was to get it replaced for free, I chose this.  I received the second product and had the same problem.  So Amazon service was very good.  Product purchased was very low quality.  Amazon please check the quality of the products you offer for sale.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BWAK48/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B000JFJLP6|5|I work for an auto dealer.  We have the same model jump starters at this dealership and I was impressed with the product and that was the reason that I ordered the same model.  By the way; Amazon price was much less than our dealership paid for the ones that we have.
B003WWNWDU|3|fit was horrible on the gs430, material as thin and pretty cheap as it dried out in the sun rather quickly, tears easy and only good if you dont care about quality or fit
B0006SU3QW|5|cool
B00H9Z1BLG|5|Nice lights.
B004DZ02SI|5|Bought for a 2007 Honda VTX 1300 with windshield.  I had planned to put behind windshield but was too big, so I mounted behind sissy bar using the attached buckle straps.  It fit perfectly, and it's gives enough room for an extra pair of glasses, water bottle, electrical tape, and kickstand pad.  I like that it's held closed only by the velcro...no fumbling with buckle closures.
B000IYNW9O|4|Look kinda old but ok , acceptable
B0066TLNT6|5|Not for the headlight washers but does fit as the windshield washer
B002YBRKQU|5|Highly satisfied
B000N5R6VS|5|The last one I bought lasted more than four years so I bought another one of the same brand when it needed replacing. It is the exact same size as the stock battery which was important since the battery compartment cannot take a larger battery.
B00F40X4VI|5|It is Made of plastic, but it gives the same readings as my Mitutoyo caliper.
B00M78820I|5|I love this my mom and stepdad have used this in there cat and it made it so much cooler without the sun burning down on the car.
B0096UB298|5|recommend
B002P8QWOS|4|once again good product..thanks for your service, and keep it up. i will for sure come back again to you
B0056EBW8O|5|Just got it! Super adorable, about to apply right now. Shipping was on time and there was a second different sticker that was cute also. Would definately buy more from this company!
B00042KG3A|5|Purchased for my Jeep and not a day goes by where I'm not thankful that I have it. Capable of lifting one side completely off the ground, this jack has come in hand multiple times both on and off road.
B000BZ53DI|5|Factory specs.  worked perfectly.
B001EA0LI6|5|Very easy to apply. The adhesive is also very strong as well.
B003CJ927I|5|Either it works as advertised, or it does not.  Works fine, What else can I say? I'm satisfied with the product.
B0069RZ5XK|5|I have had the Husky weatherbeaters in my car for one month and they fit very well. They suggested I take out the carpeted mats that came with the car but I did not do that and they work very well. They catch a lot of debri and with rain and snow they really keep the carpet dry.   I am very happy with them and did not find an offensive smell to them even though other peoples reviews mentioned this.  I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting to protect their car.  Great buy and well worth the money.
B001U8SJ3G|4|good, as advertised, received ontime
B00BITIDXI|5|This is an exact match part
B008747USG|5|The tweezers and the light are on my key chain all the time and come in handy more than I ever thought they would. I had the can opener on the keychain as well but it works so well, better than any of the other can openers in my kitchen, that it now lives on a magnet on the fridge. I will have to get another for my EDC. This was a very good purchase.
B000IZ1J3O|4|Pads for 4 piston brembo calipers, used on CTS-V1 rotors.  They should be compatible with pretty much all the off the shelf 4 piston brembo calipers.
B001TNHGLI|1|Brackets did not fit. Being a machinest i had to modify them to get them to work. I don't know if they were labeled wrong or what. Be careful in ordering.
B000JL95TC|1|Ridiculously terrible product.  Unless you own a welding torch, forget wasting your time trying to light these fat sticks. Even worse than the product is the return policy which I failed to access.  At the time I placed my order, I ordered an entirely different brand of sticks and happened to open that particular product first to use and I'm still using and enjoying those.  I opened the Coghlan's just last week and found it impossible to light one and maintain the light.  It took forever to even appear lit, and then when turned upright, it wasn't lit at ALL.  Now it is 30 days past the refund date, and I am getting only a partial refund on the 6 of 7 boxes I need to return.  LESSON learned Amazon and other sellers.  I WILL check return policy from this day forward.  My mistake.  But, Amazon, you need to quit selling these via whoever the seller was/is.  Guess I will save the opened package for cold weather and go ahead and apply that welding torch and try to use the remaining 4 sticks.  Hopefully the torch will work!!  People don't waste your time on these!!
B00SZK26T0|5|Nice *****
B006DYSLTY|5|Great fit on 2000 Mazda Protégé 1.8.
B00AMAZOEA|3|Items shipped fast, but did not come with instructions. Contacted the defenderworx company by phone and spoke to a person who was very helpful and explained how they could be printed from the website. The product was not two tone (black and chrome) as displayed in the picture as I had desired. The ones I received were just silver. I ended up returning them even though they would have looked great on my truck. The product appeared to be well made and durable.
B000C9DVTQ|5|I have bought these after going with economy (1) set that did not last a summer and I have tried a popular auto store Gold line of rotor neither are on my car now. The econo style had deep ruts in them within 5k miles and that is when I purchased the Gold line of rotor from the local Auto store in my zone. I coupled these rotors with ceramic pads and had a good set up until my first emergency stop. They warped terriblly and was forced to buy yet another set of front rotors and that is when I went with the ACDelco Professional. I also installed semi-metalic brake pads since this was the OEM configuration. I am very pleased with the Delco rotor so far but I have only put about 1500 miles on them. They were flat with no runout like you find with some \\"new\\" rotors having up to .004\\" and still be in spec. My car shakes when runout reaches that figure. Hopefully I will not have an emergency stop soon and I can keep these a five star car part. Will follow up with an update in a few months. I recomend these as they are a great value for the Amazon price.
B000AO8ZA8|5|nice quality in the silver finish which is neutral for a red truck with silver accents vs the blue one.  even less expensive but still quality.
B00C0SQPZO|3|It looks and fits great no complaints there. I just can't believe how bad this shows fingerprints. This is not the first mirrored shield I have owned, but this is ridiculous. I have been contemplating paying full price for an actual Shoei shield so I don't have to worry about it as much. It is cheap so that's a plus but I wish there was a coating I can spray on to help prevent this.
B00DC3KRZA|5|Works perfectly. Suction cup locks really tightly to windshield, both cameras work great and stay put where you adjust them. It's really easy to watch the video back on the camera or on your tv or laptop. The only downside is the battery LITERALLY only lasts half an hour before the meter turns red. But It's such a slim device, so i kinda figured that going in. The manual says having it plugged into the charger at all times won't hurt the battery, so it's not an issue. Other than that, i'd recommend this camera to anyone.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Love it!! Easy to use and makes the leather look new.
B00HSHVXN6|4|No dead bulbs which is a good thing.  Item arrived 2 days earlier than expected, another +!  They're bright but not as bright as the pictures show it to be.  Like I stated, you get what you pay for.
B001G4Z5J0|5|I've taken this on two long trips with my Buick Enclave and no complaints.  It's very solid but a bit heavy. I wouldn't want to have to put this on by myself, but I could if I had to. Even on bumpy dirt roads the carrier seemed secure.  On the last trip I took my Honda lawn mower and two 6 gal. cans of gas and it all fit perfectly inside the carrier.  The Enclave liftgate just barely cleared when loaded.  Also easy to tie things down with all the places to attach straps.  I also bought a Rola 59102 Expandable Hitch Tray Cargo Bag to go with this but have not used it yet.  The bag will fit inside along with a can of gas which is perfect for me.  Going to use the bag over the four-day 4th of July weekend.
B009ESAZHW|4|Nothing is perfect! But these lights there quality &looks...and as important the price....do deserve 5 STAR...1 OF THE BETTER DEALS IN MY LIFE.
B00NKDEYME|3|The buttons need a stronger spring in them. Sometimes they are energies when you don't need them pushed.
B00CE0MFK2|4|pretty good lights, not that big but as long as you aren't pulling your trailer at night you will be fine, the stop, turn and blinker lights are plenty bright, but when the running lights are on, they don't seem that bright and I would be worried that someone would hit the trailer and the lights not being dot rated would be my fault.  but other than that I like them, they are super thin, and hopefully I will quit breaking the big square ones.
B004AQS81S|5|Perfect ,a must when replacing rear mercruiser motor mounts
B00CF6XX74|5|A very good product.. Whatever they are coated with resists rust. They have been exposed to road salt without any rusting, and still look like stainless steel.  The ceramic pads are very smooth and quite.  I highly recommend this product.
B000CFOJ96|3|This was for the rear of my 08 Sienna.  It went on but was much harder to install than the same brand wipers for the front of the car.
B001P29XZK|1|Was fine for application (single wire covering) but very small and hard to work with. I would use this brand again but not in this small size.
B001NZTM6O|4|had to buy this new the old one would not screw into the new tie rod
B004VPX1TM|3|Good light, should of used li ion batteries instead of ni cad. I believe the charge would last longer.
B000HDEMZE|2|This product does works well.  The low rating is due to the description said it was a 2-pk.  It is not.  I only received one.
B0052SF0LO|5|Working as advertised so far (1 week). We have it installed outside our front south facing window. We were worried about the solar panel in the weather, and since so close to window we drilled a hole through the frame for the chord and have it sitting inside on the sill. Good for now.
B007N6OWGM|4|Improved the handling and stiffened the ride, much better ride Than the original shocks
B005TCHTQM|4|This door looks Great, arrived quickly and is of quality construction. That's the good.<br />The minor issues .<br />1.It's not the easiest to install, little bolts are a pain but with needle nose pliers you will pevail.<br />2.The door hits the gas cap. There is no way to adjust the door for this. It will close with pressure but, occassionally this will trigger a vacuum or canister fault on your diagnostics( check engine light will come on). I have not found a regular or lower profile gas cap yet. This is more an annoyance than an actual problem.<br /><br />Finis<br /><br />CB
B004BHEHCU|5|It's just a stiker.  It sticks, it's an awesome flag.  Its about the size of my hand.  I decided to tape it on the inside of my car because of how hard it is for these to be removed from the bumper
B009Y70TQK|5|Thought 3 out the 4 did not work until I realized that they require installation in a certain manner. If they do not work at first, turn them around (apparently a positive or negative thing). You may also have to squeeze the connectors a bit, but once these babies are installed, they are very bright!
B003H220TC|5|Fantastic!
B000HZFDQ4|3|OK to installed n my vehicle. I tried the installation before the snow came down, I got it done in 10 minutes for both tires, pay attention to instructions, the video helped. I have a rear wheel vehicle, my intention is just to use them when i get stuck because the ride on pack snow was acceptable at 10mph, on clear road after its plowed, I was not comfortable how it may may car rattle, so best used for northeasters like the blizzard that hit the northeast in January 2015 and you must drive slow due to an emergency. I don't expect to drive 20 miles to work on these in Long Island NY, generally speaking the mains road are drivable a day after the blizzard. Best to use chain tires as an emergency if you get stuck on secondary roads, steep driveways, i am not driving to sky country.  I had to return it because the size for my vehicle was too big, felt loose.
B001GMX4KY|5|This Curt front mount receiver was very easy to install on my 2011 Toyota Tundra because I previously took off and discarded the large sheet metal protector plate located under the engine (I took this off to make it easier to change oil, by the way). Had this been in place it would have been a bit more of a problem, but not too difficult. The metal on the Curt is thick, and I purchased 1/4&#34; longer bolts, grade 8 just to be safe. But don't over tighten, you do not want to strip the bolt hole. I took the OEM bolt into a big box store and, using the sizing chart, found the appropriate metric  size and pitch of the bolt that is needed (I don't remember what that was).
B00I02SVOC|5|This product is way more than a normal car jump starter. it basically charge everything!!! Highly recommended!
B0002SPCAI|5|I use it on my Benz, my wife's car, and my truck.  Mainly on leather.  It works great and I'm very happy with this product.  Recommend buying this if you love your cars like me.  Our friends used it for their leather furnitures and were happy with the results.
B002X9TNFE|5|Highly recommended
B009PIKC4C|5|Excellent product. They fully cover the floors of my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The product could not be any better. I decided on these over the Jeep brand ones after reading a few reviews that stated that the Jeep brand did not fully cover the back seat floor - these on the other hand provide complete coverage!
B00BN45Q56|5|It was a gift to someone and that person was so excited to receive it. I also had their name engraved on the back. I loved the way it looked
B001R1Q62W|5|Ford Mustang Headlight Set Black With Xenon Bulbs Driver/passenger Pair New - First time i purchases something for my car at Amazon. Luckily it arrived faster than i expected and everything was fine, installed it and works good.
B000C9Y1K4|4|everything was as listed
B000OQIGA6|5|I bought this item to change oil in my Polaris RZR.  Works great.
B00JR4D70K|5|Really sticky it works great
B00029KA6I|5|Excellent wheel cover.  I have a 1935 Ford with a 16 3/4 inch dia steering wheel.  I believe it to be the original steering wheel and over the years it has developed many cracks. The cost for a new steering wheel is $200.  So, I decided to try a lace-on cover to improve the appearance of the old wheel.  This is such a great product I may never buy a new steering wheel!  Love it!  It looks just super!
B007RVQXRO|5|These were extremely easy to install. It took less than 10 minutes. You just need two people so that one can hold that hatch up.
B00062YZYO|5|One Caveat: I had added a bottle of the same brand's carburator and injector cleaner before using this, so you probably won't get such quick results with the first bottle.<br /><br />Nevertheless, after I started driving after adding a bottle of this, within a short time, my car had a relatively smooth idle and the oil light never came on in traffic. For 5 years, the oil light would come on when idling or in traffic, no matter how clean the oil or how full the crankcase were. I learned to deal with it and manage it (more viscous oil, accelerating when possible, etc.). But since I used this, it has not come on once (except when starting, but so does the check engine light; they are on by default when the engine is not on but the car is).<br /><br />Again, since I used their less potent fuel cleaner before, it probably sped up the results. But that said, at worst, that just means I would have needed 2 bottles (at most) of this stuff to have a car that can idle smoothly. It's kind of amazing.<br /><br />The only time I have ever seen such noticeable results with a fuel additive was years ago when, after never having maintained by car beyond a few oil changes, I added Techron to my gas tanks and my MPG went up 3 MPG after 2 treatments (which for a van that only got 12 MPG in the city before, is a big deal).<br /><br />So, if your car has engine issues, I'd definitely give this a try.
B00MFSR6Q6|1|Not good compare to oem
B000C53TGK|4|Good item. Good price. Fit perfect.
B000E7UIWE|5|Can't beat the price & quality. You really can't beat this product if you need any bungees, so give it a try
B003G0O1EC|5|Fits perfectly
B009RWPST0|4|For another key.  If I remember correctly somewhere around $25.  This key was a tad larger but went in the ignition switch easily and turned smoothly.  For 1/5 the price it is a great alternative.
B007TV7ATM|5|Thank you .A+++
B003QHQW8I|5|good deal
B0060LUUCG|5|Look great on the car and went on easy!
B000AMBNPY|5|We looked & looked and finally found this truly perfect screen. We have driven over 1000 miles and I am so<br />Comfortable. The sun does NOT beat down on you at all!!  Plus it fits perfectly on the front passenger window<br />Of our 2014 Toyota Camry.
B001BK49S2|5|Installed in 10 minutes. You really do need only your fingers and a 10mm socket (with ratchet and short extension) to install. Works great, and most importantly, NO VIBRATION. Someone had broken the mounts on both these mirrors before I bought the truck, and neither would foldaway. The selling dealer replaced the driver's side with some sort of aftermarket product that shakes and vibrates even when the truck is at idle. This new one does not do that. Why would anyone pay more than twice this price for one from the big-box stores? I'm impressed.
B00V30J86I|1|Cannot fit a lot in it.
B004992OFC|4|Pros:<br />I have a 2009 Honda Fit and checked the cost of this cabin air filter at the Honda dealership. They wanted $26 for the filter, and $79  to replace it in labor cost. $14 including shipping beat this price by a mile.<br /><br />To change this filter takes less than 3 minutes.<br /><br />This filter was of the proper size, and fit into the filter container easily... length, and width, and proper depth.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The only objectionable thing about the filter is that the edges in a couple of places were curved inward so that it did not cover the opening completely. But, this was minor and I left the openings. If you have the same issue and want to verify the complete coverage, a small piece of electrical or duct tape will solve this problem.
B001BFLSX6|5|Easy to install and they will tighter then the original shocks that I had before. Great price and replacement. Would highly recommend if you are purchasing on a budget.
B008VJ9URQ|3|Feels cheaply made but still does the job . I would order from them again . 1 defective bulb but they replaced it for me with no problems.  Great doing business
B0043D7LBQ|3|According to the Wagner brake website, advanced auto, and Sears, these brakes do not fit an EX-L model 2011 Honda Accord. Kind of wish Amazon.com had the option to input trim options and engine type. Ya, I now see in the description what trim options these brakes fit. Note to self, always check manufacturer's website for part fit.
B008032NJK|5|Great quality. Was trying to find an OEM distributor and rebuild it, but they are just to hard to source these days. I was looking for things to complain about with this distributor and could not find a complaint.
B008PZBUZ6|5|Just as described
B00308LYG8|5|Every wrangler needs these
B00B00CC6O|5|I though we were going to have to rig up an ignition for our 2003 Yamaha Banshee, but we found this and it fits and works great!
B00ELXS144|5|Great
B00EZNF6SY|5|Don't understand why the blue one is only half price of the pink. I bought one each though. Kids love them.
B00445P7SC|4|Good mats for tacoma double cab. The dont really move around but i wish they use the plastic peg to secure mats in place, just for piece of mind. The driver side is about a 95% fit.
B00IGI24IE|4|easy to install and work as expected
B00EAJZ2VO|4|Good
B004AQUHKS|1|Bad experience, customer service through the floor!
B008QR1ASK|1|Towels are much thinner than the picture portrays. I would have never bought these they are more like cheese cloth. I was expecting more like terry cloth. I hate them. After washing they are like 5&#34; by 5&#34;
B00LJ3BLQY|5|Great product and fast shipping
B001RO1K4S|3|This tool is well designed with the lights. however, the handel of the tool is made of cheap plastic and will break easily.
B002ZBWKAU|5|With the cold weather my tires will loose anywhere from 2 to 6 ppsi. So I use it to help keep my tires at the correct tire pressure of 35 ppsi. I did notice that you need to set the pressure .5 ppsi above what you need. If you need 35 ppsi. then you need to set it to stop at 35.5 ppsi. I have used it on everything from my car tires to my lawn mower tires to my garden cart tires all with no problems.
B000AMBPAC|5|I've used CD2 for the past 20 years in 3 cars and found this to be an excellent product for stopping minor oil seepage in high mileage engines. That being said, it's NOT a miracle cure. There's simply no such thing in the world as a &#34;mechanic in a bottle&#34; and it won't stop a bad leak caused by a cracked or heavily worn seal, but even then CD2 will often slow the leak down by swelling up the damaged seal. If it doesn't work, then you simply need to get the seal professionally replaced, but it's definitely worth the few bucks to give it a try.
B0030Z65YM|4|I used these as a stock replacement on a mustang. Good tone and pretty loud. Read the destructions as the brakcet bolt affects the horn operation if you tamper with it.<br /><br />Pretty simple and good product at a good price.
B0012WW3LY|5|Worked great
B00LU1A0RQ|3|My husband put this on the front windshield of his Jeep because he didn't want the wipers to peel it off.  Unless you're viewing it from inside the vehicle, it reads backwards.  (He has the cap off for the summer so there is no rear windshield.)  I wish there was another option for the front windshield.
B0041PZF0A|5|Excelent...
B008YJIQ8M|5|Fits and works wonderfully. I like the chime better then the stock one and I get to keep it thru the door speakers unlike the scosche and metra versions which the box is the chime. dont ever buy those buy this one!!!
B007DBM45S|5|The item was received quickly and applied easily. Looks just like the picture. It is hard to see from the outside on really tinted windows, which was to be expected, but if you really want to show it off and have really dark windows, go for a white decal.
B002ENV9T2|5|The item was just as described good quality and was shipped quickly. It was also packed properly so it arived in good shape. I would buy from this seller again.
B00HE7SJ7S|5|As described - shipped quick
B00KWNUIHK|5|Great fit looks good
B00318NVRM|4|Brake/Tail light. It still works as I write this review, 2 months later. It would get 5 stars if it never ever burnt out. Also, why do they have to be sold in pairs? I never have 2 of these go out at the same time. Now I have an opened package at my house with one bulb in it. I would love to pay HALF of what I did here and only get one bulb. Yeah. light bulb. There really isn't much more to say.
B00080QHMM|4|Brought the product two weeks back. I find it pretty handy and always gives consistent readings. No issues so far. Gave one star less because I think price can be reduced slightly.
B004O43ZRS|4|Product was easy to install.  The only issue I found was that the clutch cable is a little long but if you're a true rider and only care that you're on the road, this product is great.
B003LF30CG|3|Very stiff, not very flexible.
B002X9WNJC|5|Easy to apply and looks really cute on my car!
B006PAM19M|5|I was cautiously optimistic about this product, but found them to work extremely well on my 2-wheel drive SUV, giving steady traction even in a couple of recent ice events.  They are quick and simple to install and allow 30mph speeds as advertised...no more.  Great for short distances, but not so good for longer ones.  No tire damage that I can tell.  A great product that I would recommend to friends.
B0016LE80K|5|I've been using this adapter for a while now.  No complaints.  It feels solid, and I don't have any problems with anything popping out.
