B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was looking for a light-weight case that will cover/protect my screen when my Kindle is in my bag... this is exactly that.  It seems very durable, looks good and fits my Kindle well.
B002EMESSM|3.0|Focused too much on visual effects and not enough on a good story.  Even us geeks need more that cool visual effects.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever had the privilege to read. It's raw emotions feel like nails piercing through you and the pure symbolism is amazing. Zusak manages to infuse death's personality with human perceptions and the result is sensational.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves books especially war junkies.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|I am loving this album. Every time I listen it takes me to this lovey happy place. I have had it on repeat in my car since I got it. I have too many favorites to even name.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app was working great! I loved it but now it doesn't let me login amymore, it just says that to try again later. And my it's not my internet because everything else works but kik! Fix this annoying problem, I can log in anywhere expect the kindle.
B00CEK9OTM|3.0|Our soon to be nine years old grandson enjoys this, but  maintains interest only for a short time.  I've tried it but it's not a top favorite.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is terrible I can't find a way to use this .A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!DO NOT USE IT SUCKS BALLS!
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|It looks like it could be fun but I haven't been able to get very far into as for me it seems there are too many icons that all do different things.The game just doesn't interest me enough to learn what all the different icons can do while playing. Our grandson enjoys it more than I do, but doesn't play it that often.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This is a visually great game that is challenging but not so difficult as to be frustrating. The sound effects and music are pleasant. There is a clue section that once you figure out the corresponding clues lead to places on your map it gives you enough to go on without totally giving it away. Highly recommend for many hours of enjoyable fun that makes you think without giving you a headache at the same time. I am an adult but see where kids of varying ages would enjoy it too.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I am enjoying the challenge of this. I started playing 'with' Garden Mahjong and thoroughly enjoy it.  For me this is more challenging, but I look forward to playing it ever so often and am getting better at locating matches and occasionally 'clear' the board!. I am learning that they aren't always identical matches but similar themes, but haven't quite figured out the 'secret.'
B0090SI460|5.0|Seller delivered the movie as promised.  It was in excellent condition.  Would buy from this seller again.<br /><br />Thank you for fast shipping.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|I could watch this again. What great actor/actresses!!! I would recommend this movie for both kids and adults!!! Try it out!
B002G1K82Q|5.0|This movie brings the Beatles Music into a Theatrical Broadway Movie Masterpiece! Fantastic!! Highly recommended if you like the Beatles music you will LOVE this movie!!
0380729407|5.0|I purchased this for a student and it arrived the next day.  I will place additional orders in the future.
B004LWZW24|3.0|I read people saying this is one of the most scariest films ever...  but I don't agree.  It has it's moments but ultimately I think the PG-13 rating and other things hold the movie back a lot..  It started off pretty good but then it just seemed to go all over the place and the scares weren't as \\"scary.\\"  Some of the ghost's 'makeup' looks ridiculous.  Minor Spoilers*- And there were so many unnecessary ghosts;i thought initially it was just the one red demon haunting the kid, who by the way is the scariest of them all.  The ending wasn't that mind blowing or anything as well.  I might see Chapter 2 out of curiosity..
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Lots of awesome CGI and a few twists/turns, but not sure if the storyline was as good as the other Iron Man movies.  I'd watch it again though.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I loved it, refresh of a great franchise. It was nice to see the characters meet for the first time. Nothing I didn’t really like I would highly recommend seeing this film.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is magical. Re visit childhood and wander through wonderland in this tale.  Gaiman paints a poignant picture with his words and took me in
1851775722|5.0|A feast of the eyes.. close up detail that you can almost feel.  For the true clothing and textile fanatic.  You will love this book.  It is stunning.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|I applaud the author his imagination but thought the book went on and on and on.  Out of 5 our book club rated a 2.5
0300169787|5.0|Too soon an extraordinary talent fled the bounds of this earth.  Heaven's Angels no doubt must have slipped into the most glorious robes the day he met St. Peter.  This book is a stunning tribute to a seriously incredibly talented designer and artisan of our time.  Just beyond gorgeous.  The quality of this book is amazing.  Sharp focus photos show the close-up workmanship of the clothing.  The book itself is of good size and heft and will look edgy and impressive on your minimalist coffee table.  Highly recommended.  Thank you Mr. McQueen for your contribution to this world.  Signed.. a fan. *sigh*
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|I have been a fan of DT since the beginning and this is by far their greatest album yet. I can see exactly why this album is up for a Grammy. It is so well written and so inspiring.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|My wife went to sleep so she wouldn't have to watch the mayhem.  I thought it was okay and now I know how to kill a zombie!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I love history but more than just history, I love the trivia surrounding a place in time. The little everyday th just mgs that make us identify with the characters. What a great story.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Lots of fun to play and easy to use. The graphics are great and the story is cute,easy to follow
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This was the worst of the 3 books. I think the actual content was about an hours worth of read the rest is sex, fight, sex, fight, sex, fight. blah, blah, blah. I had a really hard time finishing this book but needed to see the charaters thru to the end. I am glad my 50 shades journey is over
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really like this calculator.  Large touch keys make it easy to hit the right numbers.  I like the memory and clear memory function.  I just wish I could get a round number on things but if you can set it, I can not find it.  I love it though.  Made for me who loves language, not so much math, but great for everyone regardless.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The 2nd book was by far my favorite. It held alot of action and reality. This one was a fun read.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|The first season of this series is very pleasant has all the ingredients of the best British period dramas.  There is a liberal helping of humor, a wide selection of local characters portrayed by a strong cast and enough history to make it interesting.  Julia Sawalha, who played the feckless Lydia in the classic 1996 Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, is the lead actress in a very different role.  She is the independent and strong-minded postmistress to the small town of Candleford.  Life and death, family secrets and the friction between town and the less prosperous country village of Lark Rise combine to make a satisfying contrast.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had to read this book because of all of the hype. I must applaud the marketing folks for this one. I have read some steamy erotica before, but this just wasn't it for me. I was really surprised how much I fell for Ana. I loved how normal she was against the insane Christian. I enjoyed watching his shell cracking. As far as the \\"red room of pain\\" I wasn't impressed with the sex scenes. Weird one for me to review.
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|Easy understand well explained book, all photographers level must have. Good  tool for beginner and advanced  guys,worth the money I'm happy with
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|had forgotten the plot / liked the old fashion way of movie making with out down  right violence.  we need more movies  like this

B00F91RYL8|3.0|I am not much of a scary movie person so I would have given a better review but sitting on the edge of my seat for two hours is not my idea of fun. But that said it was a good movie and Brad Pitt was awesome I am glad I watched it but not sure if I would give it a second view.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I loved the free version, so when the Pro version was available I had to have it. This app has been one of the best so far. It does everything it says it can do. I love this app so much I have been recommending it to everyone I know. It works better than I expected on my kindle fire.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|I tried opening it up hit what language goes to next screen and stays on it. -  won't let me go further -
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great show with the second season being even better than the first, if that were possible. The acting is superb with the decor and detail drawing you in as if it were the real world. The war as depicted brings a new level of emotional dept. All the major actors nailed it perfectly. Couldn't be happier with the show. Can't wait to see what happens next....
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|No. I FLOVED IT. I loved it so much that I started rereading it immediately because I now I can pay more attention to the story and less time just letting Rainbow pull me along with feeling Cath. I love how the characters aren't perfect, how they don't get it right, how they are snarky with one another. I love how patient (and imperfect) Levi is with Cath, and how clearly the author loves him *because* of his imperfections. I loved the almost tongue in cheek humor and pop culture references that literally had me laughing out loud. I'm also equally impressed with the way Rainbow maintained her main story, her Dawson Creek level of self-aware teenagers and all the complications that moved Cath forward, while writing her \\"Harry Potter\\" juggernaut catalyst story and Cath's interaction with it.<br />As with her other books, Rainbow made me feel all the feels with this book and I simply can't wait for more from her.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book had many undouhtful thrills.The author did an amazing job writing and an even better job explaining. It was very,very good
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|This book read like a bad  8th grade creative writing  project. It was awful. The characters were uncomfortable and hard to like. .
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love that I can play this game on my kindle or tablet. It makes waiting go so much faster
B00A0SICYI|5.0|Husband and I both Love this movie, watched it many a time with the kids growing up.. A family Love.. And now when there is nothing on we pop it in and watch it again..
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Addictive! The second season is a bit slower than the first but I love the story and find myself looking up history facts to go along with it
B009RH9FR6|1.0|this case was too small for my Kindle Fire HD.  Not sure why it says it will fit it wasnt even close.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I love the Doctor Who series! I'm so glad my kids got me hooked. Great for all ages and the new doctor has a great comedy side.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Loved the movie and especially the scenes in Ireland...The fishing expedition was hilarious! Great feel good movie about friendship love and loss.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was kind of a fun game once I looked up clues on the internet to get past the first two rooms. Impossible without a little help. Once I got the hang of what they wanted, it was better and I could do room 3 on my own. I will continue on, but I might look up clues...for the \\"toughie rooms\\". I'm new to this kind of game.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The game is not interesting and I consider it to be boring. Maybe if it is explained a little better it would be more interesting.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent story and breakdown of the training to become a SEAL team member.  The story captivates the reader and you want Marcus to succeed with his mission and survive.  The details of his combat actions and the following events leading to his near capture and struggle to remain in the hands of his protectors is clearly written.  His story is a motivation to all possible readers.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Thought the movie very well done  It told the real story that this should never happen again to a any one regardless of their religious beliefs.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Amazing book on amazing person, just could not stop curiosity, what's on the next page. Very inspiring. And Steve - you should just meet him on pages of this book...

B0098XY5VK|4.0|It was good for a while. Its cool to play. I hope that the next person who gets it have more fun then I did.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown's books are always phonomenal.  I stay awake at night past my bedtime because I can't put his books down.  Can't wait for the next one.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I'm one of those quiet type of guys who finds it hard to approach and talk with people. I found this ebook contained practical advice which I hope to be able to put into practice.
B005TVYVI2|5.0|I read all of the reviews on this site and others, and decided to throw caution to the wind when I saw a recommendation for this product on the UK group Swim Smooth.com's website. I bought it, it came, it has worked without fail like a charm for weeks in preparation for my Ironman 70.3, Miami. It is very easy to adjust up or down, to turn on or off which I do at times while on my goggle strap on the side of my head! Forget the negative crap! Get this instrument and go hard or go home.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This series continues to amaze me. It has a different legal case each episode with a side story about the family and relationships of the main character. Wonderful
B00BY7NK96|5.0|Great book for all women... Whether you want to work from home or excel in a career. Provides good advice on how we can all do more to sit at the table and be counted. Highly recommended, not just as a book but as a philosophy.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love the product never had a problem I would recommend any body like i always do. Thanks allot Amazon :)
B00F3YHMUE|1.0|Wake me up when it's over.  Snore Fest 2013 has an official soundtrack.  Why can't good musicians make good music all the time?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|you are going to love this app! You don't need to press a key a bunch of times just to get it to work. All you have to do is punch in the numbers :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is the cutest game ever! The little minions run around like crazy. It's like another version of temple run, but it's better. The minions go places like the insides of home. The only part I don't like is that there is in app purchasing.<br />-
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I would write a review, if I could get it to work - I gave up trying and just used logmein
B006XBSAP2|4.0|I've been ordering from Amazon since 2007 & usually have no complaints with my order.  I've ordered several cds within the past few months & have had this Katy Perry CD, along with Kelly Clarkson come with broken cases.  It's not a big deal since the discs aren't scratched but I feel Amazon needs to do a better job when shipping merchandise.  I've been a loyal customer for over 6 years & expect better from them.  Try to do better next time Amazon!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Captivating easy read, and a great introduction to the Jack Reacher series.<br />Start here, or with the Second Son short story.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|In explaining how Jesus, the young Jewish radical preacher, metamorphosed into Christ, Aslan tells a gripping story of the triumph of faith over facts in the history of religion. Contrary to the hysterical criticism aired in some Christian media reviews, the book Is not &#34;anti-Christian&#34; or &#34;pro-Islam&#34;. Aslan's arguments don't rely on novel interpretation. All of his references to the &#34;historical&#34; facts are well documented, either in scripture or other sources that have been accepted in academic circles as well as those of Christian historians.  His achievement is to &#34;resurrect&#34; the revolutionary activist known as Jesus of Nazareth who fought against corruption, hypocrisy, who rebelled against an oppressive tyranny of secular as well as religious leaders of his time.
1607053551|4.0|A good general guide to getting started. Provides an overview of steps to take and ideas to consider. Does not give you resources to contact take can take you full circle.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the preview to the movie and decided to read the book. I loved it. Good, from the beginning to the end. I'm going to look at some of his other books but I want to finish the series of this one first.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|5 Stars. I was deeply touch by Eleanor & Park. This was an incredibly sweet novel about two awkward teenagers who are forced to share a seat on their school bus. Slowly, Eleanor and Park connect through reading comic books and listening to music. Friendship becomes something more as our main characters start opening themselves up to emotions. They begin to shyly hold hands and touch hesitantly. Eleanor is a redhead who is slightly overweight, poor and makes due with whatever clothing she can find to wear. Park has a mother that is Korean and his father is an American Veteran. He has never enjoyed sports, instead opting for comic books, music and video games. The feelings that Eleanor and Park share for each other are so hesitant and tender. As their relationship becomes more solidified, Eleanor opens up to Park about her home life. Eleanor shares a bedroom with 4 other siblings, her stepfather drinks heavily and is emotionally abusive to her mother and the children. Eleanor is very scared of him, and hides her relationship with Park from her entire family for this reason.<br /><br />This young adult novel is set in the 1980's. Rainbow Rowell did a wonderful job of writing this entire novel authentic to that decade. My emotions were all over the place while reading Eleanor & Park, and when that happens, I know that the author has written a story where I have truly connected with the characters. I found myself really hoping for their happiness. I highly recommend this for those that love the young adult genre.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Good action. Not crazy about fish sticks-Paltrow's part in the movie (I'll spare the details and not spoil the movie), and I thought there were some holes in the plot. But overall it was a good movie. Not as good as Avengers, but it won't bore you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is a lot like subway suffers but with dispicable me minions. with different pleases to explore and Lot's of bananas !!!!!!!!!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Really beautiful. I just loved how cute Charlie acted. Best movie ever. Sam was adorable and just how I picurted her from the book.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awesome!! Nice family movie that we enjoyed. Exciting! Always kept us on edge for the next scene. We liked it!
B009PNQUXO|2.0|it loses.track of sound do not get this app get vtube omg it sucks i hate it if you get it good luck
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Take your time playing it. Don't get frustrated. These kind of games are Awesome to play. I have 2 on my kindle fire and 1 on my iPod touch. Try the game I am sure YOU won't be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book recommend it to anyone my seven year old is now reading it. Looking forward to the next two books.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Did not like how they abrubtly ended the sieries. I felt the show could have done a better job wrapping it up.
B005ES0XVO|5.0|these crocs are very comfortable and also give you about an inch lift! The bottoms are a different design and do not slip on tile floors.
B001QOGYFO|4.0|This is a gripping adventure story set in the US Scientific Exploration base in Antarctica. Mayhem breaks out on a Russian cargo plane when one of the crew assassinates all the other passengers and pilots and forces the plane to crash in Antarctica. Fifty years later, a US Geological Survey team stumbles on the wreckage, and pays for their discovery with their lives. Clearly there is a villain in their midst, but who is it? With the cast wearing full snow gear much of the time, it's difficult to sort out the good guys from the evil-doers. Tom Skerritt as the camp doctor, Dr. John Fury, Gabriel Macht as U.N. Investigator Robert Pryce, and Kate Beckinsale as the star heroine, U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko are all excellent with a quality supporting cast. The filming in Province of Quebec as Antarctica, complete with the Aurora, is quite spectacular. The director was Dominic Sena and the soundtrack arranged by Eugene Raskin and Michael Nazaretz adds to the atmosphere. `Whiteout' refers to an extreme Antarctic storm with high winds and heavy snowfall.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I felt like I should have gone back and read previous books in the Pendergast series, if I'd had them in the first place.  I wasn't aware there was a previous book that told the story of how Pendergast's wife lost her hand.  I was a bit confused by the plot that involved his wife's death so early in the book, like, &#34;where's this story going to go now?&#34;  I'm glad I finally slogged on, though, because a few loose ends got tied up, finally.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great action and character development.  I thought the special effects were going to be terrible, but the show is just great.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|I've been following Nassim Nicholas Taleb since he released \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" and \\"The Black Swan.\\" So when \\"The Anti-Fragile\\" was published I picked it up as soon as possible. This is not my favorite book by Taleb, but it has a lot of insightful concepts and anecdotes on a variety of topics and applies them to the fragile, anti-fragile and robust continuum. After defining the terms 'Fragile, Robust, and Anti-Fragile,' Taleb gives many institutional, personal, and societal  examples. There are so many reviews of this book that below is a brief mention of just a couple memorable things among many.  Taleb's wit is still here and it makes this an insightful and entertaining read.<br /><br />  One example I find accurate, especially since the post-2008 economic downturn is the example of two brothers: George the taxi driver and John the 'personal expert' at a bank.<br /><br />  Taxi drivers, artisans, carpenters, plumbers and tailors for example, have some volatility in their income, but these jobs/professions are robust.  They are robust against a Black Swan.  However, a professional career or job, is highly susceptible to even a minor Black Swan, and certainly to a major one. With a single phone call from the personnel department the professional's income can completely halt and go to $0.  But the taxi driver continues on receiving income.  Employees, and in particular the professional - no matter how \\"high up\\" - are in an extremely volatile position.  We have witnessed this from 2008 and onward.<br /><br />  And John, like so many other professionals in modern-day America is unemployable.  He's in his fifties:  nobody wants him, even on the cheap.  His brother George however, continues to drive his taxi and may be able to do so until he's too physically and/or mentally able to drive. Who has the freedom?  John or George?  George has the freedom.<br /><br />  George still thinks and openly bemoans the fact this his brother John-the-banker has more job security. After all John gets  4-weeks paid vacation, a pension scheme, an expensive mortgage in West London and at the end of the month a *little* bit left over for savings.<br /><br />  Who has more security?  George the taxi driver.  The perception of John having more security is an illusion.<br /><br />  We are witnessing this phenomenon today in the USA and the West.<br /><br />  Here is a quote from Taleb immediately following his examples of George and John:<br /><br />  \\"The is the central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that is is a bad thing - an that eliminating randomness is done by elimination randomness\\" (pg. 84).<br /><br />  \\"Education\\" model of the United States:<br /><br />  Taleb did not specifically refer to the US or West, but he gave Switzerland's educational system as an example: Switzerland is one of the most successful  nations in the world.  But it has traditionally a very low level of university education compared to other wealthy nations.  Switzerland focuses on apprenticeship and vocational models rather than theoretical ones.  (Taleb did not note this, but Switzerland also has an extremely low number of home owners. Most Swiss rent, and there are many benefits to this model as well.)<br /><br />  In illustrating concepts and our societal phenomenons, Taleb introduces his unique terms to us to aid his explanations: extremistan, mediocristan and provides illustrations and ways to go from fragile to robust.<br /><br />  Hundreds of examples and thoughts in \\"The Anti-Fragile.\\"  There are lot of charts and graphs as well.  This book will pique your interest in many topics of life.
B009WUBERW|2.0|It looked like he had to work at acting.  Also, I don't support him because he is against the 2nd Amendment.
B00DJ735KI|3.0|If you can get through the first 2/3s of the book where he gives the history of Science, it becomes interesting. All the new discoveries about cells and stress and how we work ... fascinating stuff! I wish he gave a bit more \\"how to alter your life ..\\" advice.<br />Hard to get through it all, but worth it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's good escape game, a bit easy on some levels but definitely<br />Entertaining, and challenging on other levels. It's got cute music at points too
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you're an introvert it's hard not to analyze yourself while reading this one.  The author presents research and case studies in a way that make you reflect on your ingrained qualities as well as those gained through experience.  I feel like I understand myself better after reading this book.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I found it so hard to find DVD copys of A new hope, Empire Strikes back, and Return of the Jedi, that I just broke down and spent the money on this. I do not regret it.<br />Its becoming harder and harder to find good DVD copys of the Star Wars Trilogy, so if you are a Star Wars fan, then this product is for you!
B000000OF6|5.0|\\"Queen: Greatest Hits I & II\\" is a two CD set of the best of Queen. I chose this set over a few of the others due to the number of positive reviews.<br /><br />Without trying to sound like a late-night infomercial, this set does have all of my favorites and they sound just as good as I remember them from my teen years.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0031RS4UM|5.0|It is remarkable that I only discovered Jack Reacher last year.  Reacher is a great character and, as I've written elsewhere, he has Sherlock Holmes's investigative abilities and Rambo's fighting skills.  In this book, Reacher finds himself accidentally kidnapped when he stops to help a woman who has dropped some packages.  The woman turns out to be much more valuable (in both senses of that term) than Reacher first thinks.  This was a great page turner and I'm extremely pleased to know that I have so many other Reacher novels ahead of me.  I also recently saw the movie \\"Jack Reacher\\" with Tom Cruise.  While it received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, I loved it.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Liked the story, awesome affects and overall loved the movie.<br />Heard some people complain about them \\"calling out\\" their moves while \\"linked\\".<br />Um, we're watching a movie, about giant monsters and giant robots... I can live with that.<br />Rinko, the single best reason to buy this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing....so hard to put down....definitely onto the next book....well worth the cost of the book!!!! Completely riveting!!! Must find out what will happen next!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This was such a great book. It was suspenseful and funny at the same time. You're rooting the main character, Rose, on the whole time as she finally starts to discover life and is a murder suspect at the same time. I would highly recommend this book , if you like good books.
B007THA4FI|1.0|can't imagine the writer of the Harry Potter series wrote something this boring.  I was very, very disappointed by this.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app is great get it it has all the new and old youtube videos and functions great. But the only thing that is unfortunate about this app is that before the video starts up or when you pause a video it will shoe adds. But still a great app
B00BV5FVR0|5.0|An Absorbing and entertaining read. Makes you think differently about the world around. A really great end to the trilogy
B007ZJDGXC|5.0|Safe House is a tremendous thriller, I loved the whole concept of the story from beginning to the end. Totally recommend buying this and watching it. 5 stars!!!
0399159347|5.0|appear to lose the mental map.not this lady.kept it moving,going in directions you did not expect but never implausable.and the ending was a dandy
B008D28HYS|4.0|First thing's first. I am not even going to try explaining how this puzzle works. I have tried with friends and family, and I'm terrible at it! I have found good reviews here that explain it well, but if you can't, just look up \\"nonogram\\" online somewhere. That's what this kind of puzzle is called, and there are lots of good explanations and tutorials to be found online! Now, onto my review.<br />I absolutely love this game!!! I had the non-color version first (from when it was FAOTD), and loved it so much that I eventually decided to actually pay for this Color version (I literally NEVER pay for apps), but lucky for me, it was FAOTD two days after I made that decision, so I was able to get it for free! Since then, I have finished every level available, and it is just as fun as the original game! Actually, I even find it just a bit more challenging once you get into the upper levels, which is a plus for me. The games do run a good range between simple and very difficult, but it transitions slowly enough to give you lots of time to learn the game and increase your skill level. They are a great way to get your mind working, but easy enough to stop and start as you please. Sometimes when my mind won't stop running and I'm unable to get to sleep, I will play at these puzzles for 10min or so to slow things down and distract my mind, and it usually works like a charm.<br />My only complaint is the updates. There haven't been any in months! Not since February (2013), I think. I ended up having to download two other nonogram puzzle apps to get my daily fix of new puzzles, as I completed all of the CrossMe puzzles (aside from the \\"random\\" option) about a month after the last updates. I will happily upgrade to 5 stars when there are more frequent updates!<br />However, given that there are literally hundreds of puzzles, and it is all very well put together, I would definitely recommend these apps to anyone who wants a new challenge. So go hit that download button!!
B003WUYQSW|5.0|Gary's book is a wonderful read of passion and excitement in helping you discover yours!  I highly recommend it for anyone who is in a life slump, business slump or just want to be bigger, badder, better, more!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The writing in this book is so beautiful.  I would find myself reading a line over and over again and just letting it sink in.<br />My first John Green book but definitely not my last.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. It reminds me of Friends, in some ways, which I was a huge fan of. I'm sad that it's ending this year. =[ But at least I can enjoy the reruns for years to come!
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|It was a good Southern plot of young boys going through puberty, and the trials and pressures that it brings.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Not the history as was taught in Jr. High. Post WWII to the present in detailed behind the headlines of the what and why behind the perpetual military machine and intelligence service executing orders to insure American business interests throughout the world and, on occasion, US national security. Informative, biased to the left, but well researched with citations and authority that prove the point - over and over, decade by decade.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Its like I was checking in with old friends, show I had not seen in years, were revisted with equal enjoyment.<br /><br />Trekkies Rule
B0040I09RM|5.0|I wasn't sure I'd like this show as I'd not paid any attention to all of the commercials for the last 5 years.  However, after watching the first few episodes I was absolutely hooked!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo cards expensive as you level up. Too hard to get some items and now new rooms have items that you can't trade taking all the fun away from playing.
B00AWJMTXK|5.0|The Wall Street Journal recently said this is one of the best Wooster/Jeeves novels.  It's the first I've read and I have to say it is laugh out loud funny.  Most enjoyable!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I love playing this game with my son. It's fun and he's gets super excited. Super addicting must play if you like bubble busting games
B00005JNJV|5.0|I bought this for a gift for my brother. It arrived quickly and was in good condition. He loves it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|if you challenge yourself to three star every level youll spend hours. im not even the biggest star wars or angry birds person but the combo makes it fun. gonna have to dl the sequel soon.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I bought this for a gift for my brother. It arrived quickly and was in good condition. He loves it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Loved this book.  It appeared quite normal in the first few pages, but the story quickly picked up the pace.  The characters are unforgettable, the story line is bittersweet, and the setting is charming and quaint.  Overall, this novel seemed shorter than other Gaiman works, but I adored it from cover to cover.
B00004XPPC|5.0|I purchased this for my husband for father's day. Not my style but he loves it. It arrived on time, and in good condition.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I liked this book.  I read it over a weekend and found myself drawn to it.  Written from the dog's perspective, it's fresh and insightful.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I would recommend this book!  I couldn't put it down.  It was terrific!  I really got into reading it.  Finished it in two days!
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I love this book.  I love the way it's written and the thought that went into each element.  I love to cook and this helps me to understand more of the process behind each method.
1446303314|3.0|Page 139 there is a label error The leg is labelled as arm, the arm of the nightgown is labelled as nightgown, the nightgown is labelled as nightgown arm.  The Tilda's are even more big bottomed than most Tilda patterns.  I like the little animal patterns and today I am making a teaspoon doll.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I've had it for about a month now. As a traveling therapist, having dual ports is a necessity (charging phone, GPS, tablet). No complaints whatsoever!
B00AW57L96|4.0|Great read right until the very end ... Enjoyed it a great deal , , , , , , ,
B009ZM76J2|5.0|Great direction, production, acting, music cues of an all too familiar and sad story line -( the camera pov shots work well). Powerful drama to give you a taste of certain deep truths. All the performers sucked me into their reality.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This Cd is in my top 3 favorites. Unique folksy and mysterious upbeat sound.. outstanding vocalist and musicians... even drums!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow!  Great premise, wonderfully executed.  Went straight to the next one in the saga!  3 parts to the saga!  Can't wait to get onto the others!
B004TI5N38|5.0|A real page turner.  Hard not to start the next chapter.  The suspense keeps building.  Easy to follow.  Should be on your To Read List.
B00F875N98|5.0|Love every song. Nobody does garage rock that makes you want to dance around like the kings. Love every song.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|This book is very good, and very deep. Teaches alot about the human way. Also, RHCP rules anyways. Read this.
B000BLI4PG|4.0|The opening music at the beginning when the Wonder Wheel is in the dark just before the \\"Warriors Theme\\" is not on this. The scene near the end when the Wonder Wheel is in the sun is not on this.  These scenes feature excellent music and neither are featured here. The songs range from cheesy to Great (The Great being Nowhere To Run and In The City and the only two pieces from the score - Warriors Theme and Baseball Furies Chase)...had the rest of the Score been included, this would be 5 stars. We need a full definitive soundtrack/score of this film...but it is is better than nothing hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Buy this for the few gems on it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Using the word 'bizzare' while talking about a vampire book is silly, I know; but just when you think things couldn't get weirder, they do.  I still read to the end and enjoyed the story and writing.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|If you love Cher,  you'll love this album.. I love her voice, so she can sing anything and I smile!  So glad she's back!!
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Pretty good movie....alot of action,I hate it that they put previews at the beginning but you can skip over them. But overall I am glad I purchased this movie.
B004WR125O|1.0|First off, the device doesn't allow you to enter your wireless SSID manually, so if you have SSID broadcasting turned off, you'll have to turn it on just to use the adapter.  Onkyo effectively forces you to give up a layer of wireless security just to use the device.  That alone is enough to dock 4 stars- this might have been acceptable ten years ago, but it's 2013!  Onkyo should've known better to include this functionality.  Unacceptable.<br /><br />So I turned on SSID broadcasting just to test the device.  Despite having 100% signal strength (the receiver is literally 2ft away from the access point), I STILL have connectivity issues.  I can't stream a single song on Pandora without the connection stuttering and disconnecting.
B00000JFV9|5.0|i placed a order with you monday september 23rd what happen to my order the money was removed from my account stating the order would be sent to me by the 26 and 27th of september 2013 i went to chech my order statis and there is nothing there
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|It is pretty good great graphics and the sounds are spooky. But it's very short and fast to beat<br /> Can't wait for part 2
B00F5F0208|5.0|Well I love drake but I really wanted the explicit version of this CD I'm going to return this and  buy the other CD
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|My son loves this game. This game is also improving his thinking skills. Like thinking outside the box Or in this case more than one way to fill a cup.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was as good as the first one.  I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Very entertaining!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hi, I'm a despicable me: minion rush addict. I have other game s on my kindle and this is all I play. LOVE IT
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Not your typical zombie movie. Great plot, science based, non stop action than keeps you engaged and shouting encouragement and despair simultaneously. Well done.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had read this book years ago and loved it.  When I saw that it was being made into a movie, I bought the Kindle version and read it again.  The characters, plot, and action are all first-rate.  Now I'm ready for the movie and hope it's at least half as good.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Very funny movie!!!! It was a little heart wrenching at some points but remained light hearted. Loved it! Will definitely recommend to my friends.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|50% of the reason I purchase discs is for the extras.  Otherwise, I would just pay-per-view the movie.  The commentary track is not in this package.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie was a Sci-fi thriller with excellent effects and a dark atmosphere throughout. This correlated with a future earth that was devastated by some event which was not made clear. Unlike the Sylvester Stallone version, this movie was not centered on the personality of \\"Judge Dredd\\" but on the telling of a futuristic story. The story was well developed and what acting there was, had a quality that added to the story.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Great, very compelling  story line.You can't wait for the next chapter. My blood pressure dropped.  I like the inclusion of African American characters.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Lots of fun. Heart racing trying to finish before the time is up. Fun story line and the graphics are cute.
B007SGM084|5.0|Required reading for straight adult women who need a little excitement. I got my sexy back. These books sizzle but also have a story line that keeps you interested.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Has not worked on my Kindle Fire since the last update. Just says Facebook has stopped working!  Can you please come up with a fix???
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If to want to cast video from your google device to this device. It doesnt work. Save your money. It's crap
B008BM9L72|5.0|Excellent read. I couldnt stop reading. I want more :)<br />The storyline & characters really came alive. It makes a woman feel strong & that she achieve anything she wants to. And I feel that it teaches men that women are not objects but ppl that need to be loved & respected.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Amazing series.  Anyone who is a fan of Sci-fi will absolutely love this series. The first season is a good starter, you will have a hard time guessing the plots to these episodes which makes it ahead of the game!
B007MDB71O|5.0|John Carter is a great, classic adventure film that deserved much better than it got during its theatrical presentation. There's a great story here, a good cast, amazing effects, and a rich tapestry being woven that promises so much more had the series continued beyond this first installment. Check it out, see what those of us who have seen the film have known all along, and spread the word. A sequel is unlikely but not out of the realm of possibility.
B007HJ96NO|4.0|A nice watch.  It was both touching and a little sad.  I had to watch it for class but I think I will still add it to my collection of movies.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I would have liked a more drawn out ending, but I enjoyed the book nonetheless.  I liked the idea of taking found photos and building a book around those finds. A definite read for younger readers (and those young and peculiar at heart).
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|The Next Doctor and the two part finale are the best episodes of this disk collection.  It is a yay because of the amazing writing, but a NOOOO because this is the end David Tennant's reign as the Doctor, and it is quite sad.  If you cried during Rose's goodbye, you will most certainly cry for this Doctor.  His last words &#34;I don't want to go&#34; bring tears to my eyes no matter how many times I watch it. David Tennant is the most beloved of the actors to step into he role of Doctor since the reboot and we were all sad to see him go.  Still, an amazing collection and a MUST HAVE for any DW fan.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Not as good as the original but was not as bad as most of the recient remakes.  Worth the time spent.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|A great season for Doctor Who.  Donna Noble is like the kid sister to the Doctor and it is a great feat of acting, writing, directing, and visual effects, just like all the seasons!  David Tennant is the most beloved of the actors to step into he role of Doctor since the reboot and with the ever curious Donna Noble tagging along, you are bound to smile and have your heartstrings pulled.
B005AKFXZW|1.0|I was expecting way more than this book gave me, couldn't even finish the book and I never give up on books!!
B000ICXQXI|4.0|It is a freaky classic.  Complete with the iconic soundtrack everyone has heard, this movie is the original scary movie!
B005DJRD80|1.0|Seriously stupid. NOT appropriate topics or language for the kids. Immature and mishandles presenting appropriate behavior to them. losing virginity in a utility room like giving someone a piece of gum! UGH Keep ur kids away!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|A really good Batman movie.  Dark and bittersweet, it is the right combination with smiles and impressive craftsmanship.  Dialogue, plot, and animation are all amazing!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I have not been into Angry Birds like the rest of my family, but I have really enjoyed this one!!  Husband and kids love playing this!!
B0014J8D9Q|3.0|If you are into sad cowboy stories this is for you.  I watched for class and am giving it the 3 stars for Clint Eastwood's, and the other actor/actress' performance.
0425188809|1.0|I believe this book would have never been accepted for publication if it wasn't for the writers' reputation. Once a writer becomes so famous that any book he writes, no matter how bad, guarantees him millions of Dollars in profits, it makes sense for him to become lazy and not spend the time and effort required to produce good works. Read the other one star reviews. Bad crime novel, bad romance novel, Why is this book getting `10's? Is everybody smoking dope? utter unbelievability, one dimensional characters, the bad guy is there just for the plot, etc. The only thing that was really outstanding in the whole novel is \\"Tribute to a dog\\" which was written by somebody else and not the author:<br /><br />\\"A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love...\\"
B000T46NOE|3.0|I've heard about this movie for a long time, so I was really looking forward to watching it. However, it felt a bit campy for me. The visuals are good, but it had a predictable plot and corny dialogue.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I love a good post-apocalyptic jaunt as much as the next person, but this one has the added benefit real, meaty, wonderful characters and a unique story.  I have feelings for these broken people.  It's a rare and beautiful thing.  Highly recommend.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Fast paced and full of surprises, this was a quick read simply because I couldn't put it down. Reacher's tactics remain the same, but the enemy is always evolving. Plus the initial sequence was so compelling I just wasn't satisfied until I understood... just like Reacher.
B00F91H666|5.0|The uncut version was awesome it kept my attention and I really enjoyed it. Good movie to watch but not for kids.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|I did not know this existed till I changed from Iphone to Droid phone.  The gentleman at the store loaded it on my new Droid to download my photos from my Iphone.  He got it started and away it went.  I Have all my photos on my Droid from my Iphone.  Pretty Awesome!!!
0486274268|5.0|This book is the best I have found so far for instructions on drawing animals both realistic and in caricature. The pictures are clear and easy to follow with numerous examples of most creatures.<br /><br />I bought it to help me draw the illustrations for my own books and I'm certain it will be of help.<br /><br />Gail Jones<br />Author and Illustrator of 'Beaut'.<br />Due out late 2013
B005544TRQ|4.0|The show has a great set up of characters, who are ALL great actors.  Fun and amusing. We look forward to watching nightly.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Welcome back.  It's been long overdue.  Missed this great sound for awhile now.  This sound is so awesome and will never be duplicted.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|One of my favorite movies of the last ten years. The camera work is just amazing. Simply out its a must see.
B0092MJOMW|5.0|this is just a classic trash metal album. many of the riffs are legendary and have spawned other songs from them.
0810988232|5.0|Both the art work and the interpretations are so very inspirational. The hard cover book that comes with it for the interpretations by Wendy Froud is worth the cost of the deck in itself.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|All the grandchildren really enjoy this movie.  It is a very good tenderhearted movie that is perfect for kids.  Turning Babe into dinner is handled very nicely.
B007RFDQN4|5.0|I was really intrigued by this movie/documentary.  I never knew Charlie Chaplin had such a rough start in life and rose above it all.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was the most amazing book.  I loved it so much because it was so inspirational.  The characters were complex and quite believable.  The author tells the story from a young person's perspective, so we don't really get a look inside the heads of the adults but given the viewpoint, that is consistent.  I would read this with my grandkids and their adult parents also.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is very fun and just like the video.  I love watching the video over and over again.  You can watch the video on this app for free and no WiFi
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good addition to the continuing saga of a man we've come to admire and respect.  Keep's the flame burning bright.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Even though it was long.  I've been watching the shows. The book, along with the show, is making for interesting reading. Granted there are a lot of characters and its a little hard to keep track,  kind of like a Chekhov play.  However, if you can get beyond having to remember all the details then you will probably enjoy this.  Watching the shows helps you keep up.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this app really didn't help at all, I guess it may help some people but this was not for me
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Always good to see the little guy get the upper hand on big bad corporations that take advantage of them.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Intriguing characters with good ongoing story line. I keep watching because I need to know how the various story lines work out.  Lead actress and some supporting cast excellent.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|I give four stars just because the movies are great.<br />The package is a tin box with the plastic regular blu ray case inside. Is NOT a tin case.<br />The extras are very poor. The first movie have a cool documentary, comments and trailers, no much more.<br />the other two just the movie and the trailers.<br /><br />worth it just for the movies. The video transfer and the remixed sound are REALLY awesome.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|One of Maugham's many masterpieces. Forget the movies, Hollywood just doesn't get the depths of spirituality and the grasp of human nature that Maugham brings to light in this compelling story. Read this book!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good read.  I like the way the characters' lives intertwined.  I also loved the way Moriarty wrapped it up at the end.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|when I first started playing it it was so fun lol I can't wait till I get dumb ways to live
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This may be the best mouse i have ever used. My previous mouse was a logitech g500 then a smaller explorer mouse. Comfortable and the program was easy to setup. Only downside (personal) is that I had to get use to the size of the mouse (claw user) but the middle mouse button and the thumb buttons have a rubberized texture so its easy to grip. Overall very good product would reccommend this to any person getting into computer games.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|unreal. I have spent money to advance and when they ask for any rare seed to grow on homework is wrong and disappointing. you have to do rare seeds with pearls otherwise they don't count. real nice. also the amount of sand dollars increases but there are no tasks for days. then when you reach it you get one. don't do it. I have been doing this for months and now so upset. money wasn't worth it. you would think that the people that spend money to advance it would be better. so done./
1476712042|1.0|Travis is your typical bad boy, i.e, takes part in street fights for money, is covered in tattoos and sleeps with girls and tosses them away. Abby however is the good girl who has gone to college with her friend America to get away from her father. When America starts dating Travis' room mate (and cousin) Abby starts becoming friends with Travis. When they make a bet and Abby loses she has to stay in Travis' apartment for a month. When she starts to see Travis for who he truly is, she begins to fall in love. But falling in love isn't always enough..<br /><br />Abby has gone to college to get away from a deep dark past which we find out about half way through the book. Now, no spoilers, but it really didn't seem like that dark a past though I will admit she obviously needed to get away from her father. Travis is your stereotypical bad boy. He takes part in street fights for money and sleeps with girls and tosses them away. Nothing new so far, right?  That's pretty much how the rest of the book goes on, with new nothing really unique to this book happening, except for one aspect of the story which I'll come to later in the review.<br /><br />Now down to the characters. The main characters in the story are Abby Abernathy and Travis Maddox. The whole story is told from Abby's point of view. Through this the author constantly tries to explain away Travis' behaviour but never really succeeds. You see, Travis is a manipulative, controlling man who seems to only want Abby to be a part of his life, his world, and nothing else. This is definitely not a love story! In my opinion it takes it a few steps past \\"Twilight\\" into an obviously abusive relationship. (Slight spoilers ahead) In one part of the book, after Abby and Travis break up, he manipulates her into going to his family home and cooking dinner for him, his father and his brothers. All because she said she would when they were still together and now he doesn't want to have to disappoint his family by telling them that he and Abby have broken up!<br /><br />That's not to say that Abby is a character I particularly liked either. She allows Travis to put her into these situations. A number of times she sees clearly that he is trying to manipulate her and she still just goes along with it! The only aspect of this story that was different to most love stories  was the thoroughly unhealthy relationship Abby had with Travis. From the start they used each other's weaknesses against each other. Abby using other men to make Travis jealous and Travis using his many manipulating ways to keep Abby under his control. I truly disliked the main characters in this story and can barely remember any of the secondary characters, who serve only to provide a backdrop to the so called \\"romance\\".<br /><br />The romance between Abby and Travis is basically the whole plot, with little distractions along the way. It was a very slow paced read, and went in circles continually going back to Travis and Abby breaking up and then their reconciliation. For me it was a struggle to get as far as I did in the book and I never managed to finish. I simply couldn't force myself to continue reading. In general I would not recommend this book, however I know it may appeal to those who think obsession is equal to true love. I would recommend this book if you enjoyed \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" or \\"Twilight\\".he and Abby have broken up!<br /><br />That's not to say that Abby is a character I particularly liked either.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mohamed Hosseini is the reason I love reading. The way he spins the web of the story completely ensnares you in the lives of his characters.
0312641893|4.0|This book was a thoroughly enjoyable read. It starts off with Cinder, a orphan cyborg who was taken in by a man whose wife despises her. When he dies his wife is left with Cinder as a ward. She forces Cinder to work for her keep, using profits from Cinder's job to fund her own lifestyle. And thus we are introduced to this new, modern version of Cinderella set in the distant future.<br /><br />The author was able to remain true to the old fairytale without making it feel as though you were simply reading Cinderella in the future. Many things had a slight twist, like her friendship with her step-sister and the plague that is ravaging the whole world. Marissa Meyer managed to make this a thoroughly original novel, with the tale of Cinderella used as only a starting off point.<br />While the main plot twist was obvious from nearly the start of the book, I still found myself reading on wanting to know exactly how this was revealed and what would happen after.<br />This book was extremely good and I would recommend it for anyone, and I am eagerly anticipating the next installment of this book.

1476727651|5.0|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6nkLLhWGPw<br /><br />I am posting a link to a YouTube video I made for this novel.  The sole reason I am posting a link, rather than doing an \\"Amazon Video Review,\\" is that Amazon only allows you to upload files that don't exceed 100mb, which is absurd and unrealistic.  (For a point of reference, the video I made to talk about \\"Doctor Sleep\\" was well over a gigabyte, which is 102 megabytes beyond Amazon's size limit.)<br /><br />It's not a review but rather a \\"first look.\\"  I admit that I haven't finished the book yet--who could have? It came out two days ago; and in any case, I like to savor my books.  However, based on what I have read thus far (I'm 50 or so pages into the novel), the news articles I have studied, and the author readings I have watched on YouTube (cf. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATChLGnJLrg), the novel appears an authorial \\"return to form,\\" which is welcome in view of the mediocre quality of King's work that we have become accustomed to this decade.<br /><br />In this video, I present a brief and condensed history of King's work that I realize is rife with omissions, due to my speaking extemporaneously without the aid of written notes or adequate preparation.<br /><br />PLEASE, IF YOU DISAGREE WITH MY OPINIONS, DO NOT TELL ME I AM WRONG.  FOR, AS I STATE IN THE VIDEO, OPINIONS ARE SUBJECTIVE AND ARE THEREFORE INARGUABLE.<br /><br />Please, then, take the video for what it is; namely, an unrehearsed \\"first look\\" from the point of view of a longstanding Stephen King fan.  I have been extremely disappointed with King's recent work but want more than anything else for this novel to be a true \\"return to form.\\"  I feel that I and most \\"true\\" fans have been waiting for this ever since his deep, epic, and large-scale novels vanished and were sadly replaced with shallow, half-hearted, and unenthusiastic \\"assays\\" at returning to King's glory days.<br /><br />Thank you and enjoy.

B0048Y5N0Q|5.0|Two absolutely blistering shows on one album. The first show was from 1983, supporting the release of HOLY DIVER. Ronnie was amazing that day, with a band that was matching his ferocity at every step. From show opener of \\"Stand Up and Shout\\" to the last note, it is pure Heaven (and Hell...couldn't resist).<br /><br />The second show is just as exciting, promoting the DREAM EVIL album. RJD and the boys offer up an excellent mix of Rainbow, Sabbath and Dio numbers, keeping the crowd moving. My personal favorite is the excellent performance of \\"The Fools Sailed Away\\", but there is not a weak song in the set.<br /><br />If you are an RJD fan, you MUST own this. Heck, if you are human and like music, you MUST own this.
B00181MHQU|5.0|West Side Story is an amazing piece of American film history that exemplifies Leonard Bernstein's passion to tell a story with his music so that audiences will enjoy the experience and share his emotions.  Although he was only one key element in the artistic team of this work, his imprint is the most defining.  In one work, it is an opera, a ballet, and a dramatic theatrical performance that succeeds because his music is still as exciting today as it was in 1957.  These compositions served as the inspiration for the related DVD and CD entitled \\"The Making of West Side Story,\\" with Bernstein directing opera singers and a studio orchestra.  His music also served as the inspiration for Oscar Peterson and Stan Kenton to develop their own jazzier versions of the compositions.  I own all of these variants of West Side Story (The Making Of WSS, as well as Peterson's and Kenton's works), and they are a tribute to Bernstein's genius not only as a composer, but as an artist who inspires others through his work.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|You would have to be somebody like me who actually remembers watching the original series when it first came out in 1966, to understand. The characters in this new series are edgy, and intense, making it what I believe to be the closest in similarity to the original series. The new Kirk has the same cockiness as the original; the new Spock is over the top logical, as was Leonard Nimoy.<br /><br />The similarities to the original cast members is almost eerie. From Scotty and Uhura, Bones, and Checkov, the casting was spot on. I've been watching Star Trek for over 45 years, and I'll keep watching as long as they keep making them.

B001C4CI8U|4.0|- \\"How long has he been dead?\\"<br />- \\"Five hours.\\"<br />- \\"Question him.\\"<br /><br />If it doesn't quite have the fire or scope (at least at first) of, say, Battlestar Galactica, then at least, from jump, Fringe matches it in smarts. Don't be fooled by the slow first batch of episodes and how they're so... episodic. It's not so deep into the season before we're clued in that there's some ambitious world-building going down. For this or that reason, I missed out on this series' original run; I'm only now watching FRINGE. I'm kicking myself for having missed out.<br /><br />The surface premise is a familiar one, dating back to THE X-FILES and even further back to KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER. Based out of Boston, the FBI's unconventional Fringe division is tasked with investigating the weird and the unknown. Fringe comprises of FBI Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), shady operator Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and maverick scientist - and Peter's estranged father - Walter Bishop (John Noble). Hands down, Walter is the most interesting character. He once was involved in a top-secret U.S. Army experimental program specializing in the field of pseudo-science, but then a case of manslaughter landed him in a mental institution for seventeen years. Today, he remains a genius even if he'd done lost his mind. He's been sprung and remanded to the Fringe unit and specifically to the custody of his reluctant son. And, by the way, all hail John Noble who is brilliant and utterly delightful as the eccentric, no-filtered Walter Bishop.<br /><br />So what's the significance of deja vu? Why is there a cow in Walter's basement lab at Harvard U? And what is the Pattern? And why is \\"destruction through technological progress\\" so relevant? In a reality in which corporations have higher security clearances than the FBI, aren't you intrigued by Massive Dynamic (motto: \\"What do we do? What don't we do?\\") of which shadow seemingly looms over each of the Fringe unit's investigations? Season One isn't as jaw-dropping or audacious as following seasons would prove to be but, boy, does it ever set the stage. I'd even forgiven Joshua Jackson for stealing Joey away from Dawson.isn't as jaw-dropping or audacious as following seasons would prove to be but, boy, does it ever set the stage.

B00FFVML74|4.0|At first viewing, I didn't expect to like this series as much as I finally did. I'm getting wary of those grim, somber dramas, because some of them aren't that good. Also, there's a little too much of the edgy camera work for my taste, and they could have told the tale more tightly, with fewer spinning-camera out of focus medical episodes for DI Hardy. I skipped several scenes in the middle episodes without losing the thread. This story might have been stronger if told in six episodes instead of eight.<br /><br />That said, I found myself drawn in to the story and it was hard to wait for the last episode to become available. This series is grim and somber, edgy and foreboding, but also rich in characters, local color, and human feeling. I'm still torn between thinking the solution was a bit too pat and pulled out of thin air, and remembering some of the characters the series took time to explore as it wound its way to the end.<br /><br />This is the kind of TV drama the Brits do so well. I'm glad I spent the time to watch it.

B0035JRVBO|3.0|This movie is not for everyone. Some will be put off by the motto of the mother of Forrest:, To thine own self be true. which is evident in the beginning of the film when he sits on a park bench and tells his life story to strangers and takes a walk half way across the country aimlessly walking until he suddenly stops saying that he is tired. His girlfriend, Jenny, reminded me of that woman in Of Human Bondage. Jenny decides to marry Forrest iat the end of her life because she needed someone to take care of here while she was dying of AIDS.  There are interesting historical events woven into this story and the sequences of the fighting in the Viet Nam war were engaging. The book, Forrest Gump, was more interesting.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from season 1, and hints (but no major spoilers) from Season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />The fist season of Homeland was very original and told a very good story.  Brody, who had been a POW in Iraq was turned into a terrorist and a part of a plot to execute a terrorist attack in America, which he backed out of.  At the end of season 1 only the viewers knew the truth.  That changes very quickly in Season 2.  The tape he made confessing to the bombing he backed out of comes back to haunt him in multiple ways in the second season.<br /><br />I cannot say too much without giving away a lot of what happens, but there is another terrorist plot in the second season that we don't know the full extent of until about 3/4 of the way through the season finale.  Many of the characters and relationships in the show change, and there are a couple very big twists.  The season ends with some things resolved and other questions left open.  It definitely leaves the show to go into a very interesting direction in the third season and will hopefully keep Brody's storyline from getting worn out.<br /><br />The acting and writing of the show are both top notch again.  I do not think there was a downturn in either from season 1, even though there are some far fetched moments.  The A/V quality of the blu rays are very good, as you would expect.  There is not a ton of bonus material.  There is a very short prologue to the third season, a short film by Damien Lewis, a making of the second season feature and some deleted scenes.  There are also commentary tracks on selected episodes.  All in all, if you are a fan of the first season, you will most likely be a fan of the second.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Shining.  I believe it was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and along with The Stand and 'Salem's Lot, it has remained, for me, one of the holy triarch of SK literature.<br /><br />Like many diehard SK fans, I've wondered what became of Danny after he and his mom left the Overlook.  Because, you see, that is what SK does so incredibly well.  He doesn't write books, he creates people.  Out of whole cloth.  And to his Constant Reader, those people can be as real as any flesh and blood being.<br /><br />Dan (not Danny, still hard for me to get used to) has had a hard life since the events of his childhood in Colorado.  But he's been fortunate to have love in his life, first, his Mother and Dick Hallorann, and then later the people he comes to view as family.  There are a couple of themes in this novel, one is, as quoted in my title, life is a circle and what goes around comes around, and the other is the importance of family (and the friends that you make your family).  The intriguing thing about this story is that it's not just in Dan's story that this is apparent, but also in the True Knot (a.k.a. \\"The Bad Guys\\") story.<br /><br />I suppose there is also a third layer to this, and that is the importance of kindness and helping others.  SK, as he's matured in age, has mellowed.  I'm sure coming to terms with his own addiction issues has colored this, and this story is gentler as a result.<br /><br />SK no longer holds the scares for me that he did when I was a teenager, but his story telling is still as sharp as it ever was.  Now the scares come from your fear that the characters you have come to care about will be hurt, not from the specter hiding behind the bathroom door.  I'm not sure if that's something that's changed in the Author or this Constant Reader.  Either way, Dr. Sleep brings us up to date on the Life and Times of Daniel Anthony Torrence, because we can't connect with him on Facebook to find out how our old friend from childhood is doing.<br /><br />One last thing..... it's rare (actually, it's never happened to me) that SK does something that takes me out of the reality of the book I'm reading.  Even when he throws in Easter Eggs about another novel or story that he's written, you know, when you read SK, that you have entered his Universe and you will probably find other stories referenced.  There is one line in Dr. Sleep, a throw away, where a character is mentioned.  The character is not part of SK's Universe, she's from another universe all together, and it momentarily dropped me from the SK world as fast as Abra could cut off Rose.  If there was one thing about this story I didn't like, that was it, taking me out of Danny's life and dropping me back into reality.  Frankly, I prefer staying in SK's Universe as long as possible.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|This is nothing more than a &#34;porn&#34; book.  I shudder to think that young people (under 18) may be reading this trash.  The description of the sexual encounters of the two characters were inappropriate.  It was so bad that I literally began skipping these parts of the story (which meant not reading many pages).  The story line did catch my interest, as I was hoping that there would be a redeeming change in the personality of Christian Grey, and there was a change.  However, it gives the impression that megamillions and the love of a &#34;virgin&#34;,  is needed in order to overcome an abusive situation.

0553381407|5.0|I could finally identify with the trauma, pain, and anger I hadn't allowed myself to feel, let alone talk about.  I was 40 when the door to my family secrets blew apart and I was faced with the reality of many failed relationships with spouses, friends, employers and children, while listening to a video called &#34;Chalk Talk&#34; at a drug rehab facililty where my 15 year old son was trying to recover from addictions to drugs.  It was the first time I'd ever said out loud, &#34;My parents were alcoholics&#34;.  From there I sought counseling and was given this book to read.  I then joined a twelve step program called Adult Children Anonymous and attended once weekly for 4 years.  It all started with the reading of  this book.  Now I am privileged to give it to a friend who is where I was when I started my journey.  I would recommend this to anyone who would like to heal and recover from a traumatic childhood that carried into every aspect of their adult life and is making it unmanageable.  Susan Forward is very much ahead of her time.

B00BATKPBE|5.0|We've all heard the stereotypes about kids who grow up to be scientists: precocious, prodigious little children, lonely and isolated from their peers, who lock themselves in a room for several hours at a time doing experiments. By his own admission, Richard Dawkins was none of these things. When he lived in Africa as a boy, he was apparently more interested, for example, in playing with toy cars than watching a pride of lions devour its prey. However, he was-- and is-- a lover of words, and that is very obvious when reading any of his beautifully written twelve books.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins's latest book, An Appetite for Wonder is an autobiography that details the first half of his life, from his childhood up until the publication of his first book, The Selfish Gene, in 1976. The first half of the memoir details his family history and his childhood. The second, less personal half is about his intellectual awakening in his late teens which leads to his passionate pursuit of studying biology at Oxford. The book concludes at the beginning of his scientific career, when he begins as a research scientist and eventually becomes a science writer; this is when his life takes a dramatic shift. We are left with a \\"cliffhanger\\" of sorts and find ourselves counting down the days until 2015 when Dawkins promises to release the second half of his memoir, provided he does not die before then. His mother is in her mid-90s and his father died at the age of 95. Obviously there are some robust genes in his family, so I don't think we should expect Dawkins to check out any time soon, provided he does not get hit by a church van (Google it if you don't get it).<br /><br />What is really fascinating about An Appetite for Wonder are the philosophical questions that it postulates throughout. Yes, there are some endearing stories about Dawkins's early love of words; and yes there is a story about him, at the age of 19 months, telling other children that the Santa Claus who came to entertain them was actually a man named Sam, possibly foreshadowing Dawkins's journey into skepticism; yes there are some really interesting research projects that he did as a young man; and yes there are some interesting photographs to look at. But embedded within many of these stories is a continuing \\"what if?\\" question, and that is what I find the most fascinating. What if certain details in Dawkins's life had been changed? What if he had gone to different boarding schools than the ones he actually attended? What if he had not been born in Africa? What if he had not returned to England at age 8? What if he had been switched at birth and ben raised by different parents? What if he had not encountered certain friends and mentors during the course of his life? How did these people and experiences shape his personality and his professional life? More profoundly, what if a cannonball had hit his great-great grandfather's \\"family jewels\\" (yes, apparently almost happened)? Hell, how about any particular incident that did or did not happen over the course of history?<br /><br />A lot of the questions about life and existence that Dawkins raises are ones that I have asked myself throughout my life, everything from the events that led to my conception to my first summer at overnight camp at age 14 which dramatically changed my life. The latter is too long of a story to go into here. However, in a very clear and simple example of an important event, my father told me that his mother left his father (my grandfather) and returned to him only because she found out she was pregnant with my aunt (my father's older sister). Had it not been for the social taboo of being a single mother, my father would not have been born, and neither would I. Not that the ends justify the means, but it is still interesting to think about. Dawkins-- and all of us-- owe our unlikely existence to a very precise string of events that occurred ever since the universe began. Change any one of these events, no matter how seemingly insignificant, and we-- Dawkins, you, me, or all of the above-- would not have been born. Perhaps it was not intentional, but it seems that the section Dawkins wrote about his early research into animal decision-making is an apt metaphor for this.<br /><br />Rounding up my review, I want to commend Dawkins for his thoughts about the bullying he witnessed as a boy and how he regrets not intervening. I say this because I was bullied myself and I know that many people who were bullies or, in his case, who were bystanders are in denial or simply don't remember when confronted about these things later in life. It is not an easy thing to own up to. Overall, An Appetite for Wonder is an outstanding read by a truly talented and deep-thinking writer. As I say to my friends when I recommend a book, just read the damn thing.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|Language is a bit archaic, but gives the book great voice.  My students really enjoyed this book. Give it a shot if you are looking for classic literature.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Very interesting  Some scenes were action packed . I especially enjoyed the character and determination of ELI . There aren't many men around like him today or maybe there are and we just don't get a chance to see them .
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This was an excellent blu ray DVD from amazon.com  Perfect quality for my HD television and the movie was a great Sci-fi movie.  Loved it.
B00E8S2GJI|1.0|Like the BluRay of The Haunting, why does Amazon advertise the Extended Box Sets in 3D of The Hobbit:Unexpected Journey only in 1.77 or so and not like the shorter version box sets advertised as; 2.40.1?
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|I got this application and have tried on my Kindle Fire. It's good to play with. And Graphic also great!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I wouldn't book a hotel room without reading the comments in Tripadvisor first.  I have been steered away from some seedy places and found some unknown gems through this ap.  I've been a member for years and recommend this site to anyone traveling.
B008LP8QE8|2.0|I was disappointed to find that not only are there no hyperlinks through the text, even the table of contents does not click through to the relevant chapter, and nor does the index. The most basic kindle books from the very first kindle, for free, usually have this ability.<br /><br />Of course the content is there (doesn't work in android galaxy s4 by the way, even though the screen should have an adequate resolution for it), but don't expect to do some quick fact checking using this e-paperweight.
B0026ICMLO|4.0|My order came earlier than I expected.My ovie was cheap and easy to buy. I will buy from them again. Guaranted!!! The movie that I ordered was Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs one of Disney's all time classic. The Dvd Case was in perfect condition although there were fingerprints on the case as if someone had grease on thier fingers. The dvd playes great,however there was like juice stains on the front of the dvd and the Blu-rays had fingerprints all over them, The book was in a acceptable form.The Spine was in tack but there were fingerprints.The Original shell had normal shelf wear and the corners were split. It was a cheap and great buy.<br />I look forward to buying more items from this seller !!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is epic it has a lot of things and even servers. you should bye it.do it now.come on what are you waiting for
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Enjoying watching the series. I wish it had made it to regular network TV.<br />I am only 5 shows into the series, but look forward to seeing them all.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Crashes on original kindle fire when used with Free Time.  That pretty much says it all.  Kids can't play it, so it's effectively a waste of money.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is a fun game. Easy enough for my littlest kids to play but still able to stump the big kids at.Times.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Downtown Abbey is by far the best serial on television at this time.  The acting is superb, the characters are so rich and developed.  I was recently in London and would have enjoyed visiting the castle, but sadly it wasn't open on the days I was there.  I have recommended Downton to friends and family who love it as much as I do.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Everytimr I try to download a song or video it says complete but I try to play it and it's only half of wat I downloaded
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The product is very easy to install and is worth the money!!! One of the best HDMI Streaming players I have used.
0761158820|5.0|Our 5 year old loves it, the 3 year old wants it (just ordered another).<br />Great fun, quality book. Family spent a good deal of time just reading and reviewing the different monsters!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Excellent CD. Upbeat to ballads. Can't stop listening to this CD.<br />Makes you feel good. And it is SO good to have something new from Cher.<br />Music is an individual taste, as we can see from some of the reviews.<br />Bravo Cher. You will always be my number one. Don't over analyze just enjoy.<br />Favorites are many Dressed To Kill, Take It Like A Man, Sirens, Lie To Me, I Hope You Find It.<br />Listening to this CD just puts me in a better mood.<br />And to me that's what matters
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's cold in the morning and ridiculously hot during the day. Weather seems to be changing so often I find myself referring to this app to determine if I'm choosing the right outfit or if I'll need to take a jacket with me. Nothing worse than over dressing in the heat. Depending where you live, this could come in handy.
B008MM9630|5.0|this app is a fun little game where you can save up for mythical creatures grow cool plants and have your own town I enjoy playing this and hope you do to
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this book because it tell me every thing so I can no about suffy  an I no most about every thing about right no www.an im so keep reading this book an I love you read you can see about a lot of sufft an you got to no about ever th Iraq n
B009WUBERW|3.0|Personally, I enjoyed this movie.  I rented it with no expectations for anything other then action and special effects.  Typical bang em up plot .  About what I expected.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|this apps is always forceing close. If I could even watch the videos it would be an okay app kindle fix it !
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good reading. It kind of drug in the middle, but the ending made up for it. My book club gave it a 4 overall.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a good book. And I like all of the diary of a wimpy kid books I have all of his books
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King just keeps getting better! I wish he would publish more. Who cares if he saturates the market, he's that good! Stay calm and write on.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love my Yahoo Mail.  It always works perfectly but I can't get it yet on my Kindle.  I'll keep trying.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the story of many people and one family.  It demonstrates the endurance of mankind and the complicated and messy aspects of their lives.  It is a touching story that comes back to the beginning in the end.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Only thing it needs is a washing machine sound :)  Love that you can put a timer on it and have it running in the background as you read. On the kindle fire anyway.
1451695195|5.0|I have no problem believing this and it has spurred more interest in this subject. There should be no fear of death.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I was looking for a mindless action flick - and I figured it would be fun to see all the stars together - Sylvester, Arnold, Bruce, Dolph, Jet, and even Chuck and Jean-Claude.  And it was. But the extra gore of blood spurts on every shot and squishy noises for every knife insertion was a little much. Took away from the experience.<br /><br />It's ok, but beware of the gruesomeness.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Not much to say. I was completely blown away by this film. The cast is perfect, the plots are strong, and while the movie is indeed long,I never once felt the need to stop watching.  Will definitely be recommending this to my friends.
B00F5F0208|5.0|Great album  best one yet Drake has done it again qality cd I recommend to anyone that is looking for a good cd
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I didn't hate these books, but I certainly did not love them.  I think what kept me reading them is that I had been introduced to them by way of the characters on the TV show which I loved and had become invested in.  I felt like I already knew the characters and wanted to know more about them.  If I had picked up on the books before I had picked up the TV series, I may have been disinclined to read them all.<br /><br />They are not horrible, and some of the characters are interesting, but GRRM spends way too much time describing the scenery, clothes, meals, etcetera (not to mention the blood letting and sex scenes), we get it...move on and tell your story.  I don't mind a brief description so as I can get a nice visual for the mind set and the feel of the scene, but I don't need a page of what was served at dinner or what materials, colors and designs went into someone's garments.<br /><br />My only other nitpick is all the minor characters..way, way too many.  It's hard to keep track of the many main players, let alone the castaways who have no real import to this story....and for the love of God if it's not confusing enough, why keep using the same names over and over again.  God! Just use different names for your characters...is it so hard?
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The book is quick and easy to read...the exercises are easy to incorporate into a busy life.  Very interesting and fun to do exercises!!
B009V3KKXY|4.0|Good starting point for someone, who want learn paracord tying from very simple to complicated designs. Don't forget about Volume 2 from same author!
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|This was a fantastic story. The twists and turns the characters maturing over the years brilliant stuff. I love this author and would recommend<br />this and any of her other books.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I find this book very interesting and it grabs my attention completely. This book is fantastic and i would love to read more of the series.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|My little cousin is going to love this, he's always a handful and he's going to be busy putting all of this together. I may have to buy another if he finishes to quick.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This works like a charm!  So very happy with this app.  Now I can pdf books, etc. for my Kindle Fire and they open up quickly and easily!
B001NLL93W|5.0|it was the best book out if the whole series!! very thrilling and left you on the edge each chapter
B0086700CM|3.0|One suggestion is allow for power ups and coins etc to show up on my new tablet.  I guess I lost ALL OF MY HOURS AND HOURS BUILDING UP MY POWER UPS!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of smartest shows on television.  Great characters and great weekly and over arcing storylines. It's one of those shows when you watch it you want to continue watching each episode without stopping.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Very different for Nine Inch Nails and worth every penny. A new approach for them and I loved it. Don't hesitate to purchase.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Lots of good twists and turns.  Good book.  The Hit also very good!!  I do recommend them both.  Robie is good character.
B00BQBNK04|1.0|The singer/actor is wonderful, but the recording cuts off before the end of the song. Ruins the entire experience.  I'm not sure why this hasn't been fixed - Amazon has gotten lots of complaints and returns about it. Beautiful song, talented singer but horrible recording.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I didn't want it to end.  The character are so vivid I felt like I was there.  A great read
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This is my first album by QOTSA although I have heard their music from past years. What really caught my attention was watching them on Letterman; the full concert version. I would say this album is a must have for QPTSA fans.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|great game haven't play a game on a portable device with these kind of graphics very little freeze here and there but besides that its an almost perfect game probably the best I every play on a portable device
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great acting and the scenes are beautiful. A little romance, mystery and suspence all in one (with out any clothes coming off).
B000FC13Y0|2.0|Having read and really enjoyed Neil Gaiman's 'Anansi Boys' I was looking forward to working my way through his other books.<br />Obviously I chose the wrong one to begin with as this tale is over the top fantasy wise and difficult to recomend.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Really  enjoyed this movie! A well done, fast paced, well acted. Having  grown up with the original series, this is a interesting new take on Gene Roddenberry's works. Then to include the part; The reference to Trouble with Tribbles, I'm sure Gene Coon would smile. Hope there is more to come.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Spartacus is graphic, but you can't stop watching, the story line, the actors, the plot makes it amazing The arena is exciting and yet gory but, the scenes are very mature but the story line is amazing.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This was as good as all of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. It's always fun to see what Greg will get himself into.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was difficult to put down. I enjoyed the book. The end was odd...why did the author go back? That was the only thing I did not like.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|The perfect follow up to Necrotism. Excellent album, not one bad song on the whole album. Theysound like they never stopped.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the deepest books I've read---layers upon layers of meaning and surprises. I'm glad the trilogy was complete when I started with this omnibus. I would have gone nuts if I'd had to wait for installments.
B00005221M|1.0|They took out too much of the original dialog that made the movie great.  I highly recommend NOT wasting your money.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Saw it in the movies and as soon as it hit Amazon, I thought with Netflix I Would never pay to rent a movie. Man this was the best team up ever for Hansel and Gretel. If there is a sequel, I am seeing it. This part witch kung fu, martial arts, retro medieval, it was good, surprisingly good. and Famke playing these dark crazy lady parts, I don't know, she's in here too as the head witch.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|I bought the FT-1 adapter to use with my AIS Micro-nikkor 55/2.8 arguably one of the finest macro lenses ever made by Nikon. On my V2 in P mode and manual focus, exposure is set automatically either with fixed ISO or not. Manual focus is really not a problem because macro shooters normally manually focus anyway. Results were outstanding. The adapter is beautifully made and  contains its own programmable chip. Firmware is loaded via the camera like the lenses. Another outstanding use is with my AIS 180/2.8 ED.  A really outstanding product. If you look at how it's made, the cost is reasonable. It gives new life to AI lenses.
B0009PAVI2|4.0|I use it currently to store my 2 CPLs in this. Not sure why I even bought 2 CPLs though :)<br /><br />The case itself is well padded and fits the 2 77mm filters very well.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This works well if it works.  I found out that it doesn't always work though.  The limit is 3 alarms settings so if you need more than that you'll have to buy an app.  If you only need it occasionally it might be okay.  For some reason this didn't alarm after I set it after a few hours.  Some might have better luck, but now I only use it if I'm setting it for 2 hours or less.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Hours of fun for the person that loves card games. Enjoyed it from the first time I played the game. Thanks
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The book is direct and to the point. The instructions are clear, easy to understand and very well organized. It is structured so that it's easy to go back and reference each section.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|This was a remake and it was all fun to watch Leonardo as usual but, not sure why the movie had to be so long. I understand the emotional rollercoaster and character devlopment, but Leonardo and his LONG movies, what happened! It was good, sad ending but some who written triumphant, Graphics are amazing! Spidey is in it and a few others, kept my attention but this was eight hours I will not get back, lol, ok about three or so, felt long, though I was in the movie. sheesh.
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe an adult wrote this... the \\"heroine\\" is a college student, granted, but the writer, I hope, was over 18. But the sound of the prose, and the lack of variety of descriptive terms leads the reader to believe the story is also written by a 15 year old.<br />For example in the first 20 pages, the term \\"flushed\\" or \\"blushed\\" must be used 50 times. I get it, the protagonist is young... there has to be more descriptive terms to use than those two words. I almost put the book down based on the repetitiveness of the language. To me, the whole thing is just a string of sexual positions put to words, and not very good ones. After 100 pages, I was bored... and I can't bring my self to finish the rag. Really awful. I can't believe there is going to be a movie about this... there is porn everywhere! Don't waste your time.
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|This book is a fun exciting read. I have been reading a lot of super hero fiction lately but this stands head and shoulders over the others. It is a real twist of the supers genre that never becomes trite or awkward..<br /><br />The world is great being simultaneously a post apoc setting and urban fantasy, throw in a big does of 1950s.<br /><br />The characters are great and a great sense of humor comes through. The action scenes are very well done, and the motor cycle chase is epic.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed most of this novel. No, King still isn't phoning them in. I think he still writes with passion, although not as prolifically as he once did. I guess it's hard to sit at a typewriter for six hours every day when you have a billion in the bank, and you're sixty five years old and feel like the clock is speeding up on you. I'm sure he takes more time to smell the roses than before. If we can get one good novel, per year, out of him then I'll be happy enough with that.<br /><br />The only part of this novel I didn't like was the showdown between Abra and Rose the Hat. It seemed a bit too implausible and cartoon-like. All that walkie-talkie communication that was the shining was too overdone. And the True Knot revenants were written in caricature forms and thus it made them seem far less menacing than they should have been - could have been. To be honest there was nothing scary about this novel. And it wasn't nearly as good as The Shining. But is was good. Good enough for me to give 4 stars.<br /><br />King's writing has evolved so much, almost to the point of being an entirely different author. I miss the gritty, pulpish writing style of his earlier books - the Bachman books standing as the best example. I loved when his stories were shorter and tighter, like: The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man, just to name a few. I think a lot of the grit is gone from his writing. It's as if he is cutting and pasting from those vast stores in his brain that is a lifetime of writing and reading. Having said that, I still enjoy everything he puts out there, and he is still my fave author. I digress.<br /><br />I purchased this book with the immersion reading add-on, and so I went through it both reading the kindle book, and listening in my car to the audio version. I want to say that the nararrator was extremely talented. He was amazing at changing from one character voice to another. He put a lot of life into those characters. Great job!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great story. Well acted. Kept you in suspense all the time. Interesting characters living in this small town in England.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Most movies don't include great action & drama now days, but &#34;Star Trek Into Darkness&#34; does it. This movie is heavily driven on the emotional development Spock's character, and the action is undeniably exciting.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|This was one funny movie, the ooo cat is hilarious! Antonio was made for this role. so good.hilariously funny to the bone
B000654YS8|5.0|This is by far a really great product. One of my favorites to listen to and in great condition. Thank you!
B00EM764ZC|2.0|Yes, It not working at all (while google maps can), next time pls try better before taking money from user
B004AQR29C|3.0|I don't mind some gore and violence, but this movie seemed to be more about how they write a plot around violent scenes than having some violent scenes that explain or enhance the plot.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Pros:<br />Shows which Saved Searches  have resulted in new matches.  Wish the web page would show this status.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Crashes every time Unwatch is selected for an item.<br />Missing an option to send a question to a seller about an item.
1444777556|5.0|I love all the Bob books...This is one of those books you read slowly because you don't want it to end...Great read!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Ok, so they are not spring chickens but these are seasoned actors and the movie is very watchable. Helen Mirren can play anyone!
B004Y1QKKK|5.0|No comments.....it´s a classic!! His tales were specially touching to me. Everybody should read at least these, just to start understanding Mr. Wilde´s personality.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I like zombie movies and was a little suspect that this would be a good movie but I like Brad Pitt so I gave it a shot.  The movie moves very quickly with a very fast character development on Brad and his family and moves right into high impact action sequences. After each action sequence is a little breather with some human interaction to further develop the human side of the characters. The action scenes are very well done. The film overall is well written, well directed and well acted.<br /><br />I liked ever part of this movie. I was surprised it was this good as I had relatively low expectations for it.<br /><br />It looks at the good and bad parts of humanity, through the randomness of mother nature's vengeance, you're taken on quite a ride where good people and bad people are harmed. It is sad and uplifting. It is exciting and suspenseful.<br /><br />Loved it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A wonderful story of heartbreak and success. Lots of history that is substantiated throughout the years. I highly recommend it.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Dan Brown is one of my all time favorite authors. I've recently read Digital Fortress and The Lost Symbol and loved them both. I'm even thinking of reading Angels and Demons again since years have passed from the first time I read it. I found it thoroughly enjoyable back then.<br /><br />I took Deception Point from the library. I finished it some time ago, but I wasn't in review mode then. I decided to write it  today before I completely forget that I was supposed to write it.<br /><br />Following the pattern of my previous My thoughts on posts, I have to tell you what I liked & disliked about it, rate it and say who I'd recommend it to.<br /><br />The first thing is to tell you what I liked. Well, obviously I like the fact that Dan Brown is the author. The suspense, the political and corporate games, Rachel Sexton and Michael Tolland. I disliked the many scientific facts in between because I couldn't comprehend them. To think that once upon a time I was so excited with the whole extraterrestrial life thing. I ended  up looking forward to reading more about the senator (and he is quite the obnoxious character). I couldn't read it as fast as I did the other Dan Brown books. I had no trouble leaving and not turning a page in 2 full days! Then I was like: \\"Come on girl, It's Dan Brown! You love Dan Brown!\\" So, I sat down and finally finished it. I wasn't right about the ending and you know how much I like being wrong when it comes to books. See below for my final verdict (I mean rating :P ).<br /><br />Rating - I'm torn about it, I've given all his books 5 stars. But, there is a first time for everything. 4 stars for Deception Point<br /><br />Who would I recommend it too - Dan Brown fans, thriller and suspense fans
1609611543|5.0|After my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac disease, I purchased several books for her on amazon.com. This one came up as a recommendation, and after browsing through the &#34;Look Inside&#34; pages, I purchased it immediately. When I received it I couldn't put it down.<br />Contrary to all the other diet hype, this book made sense. By the second chapter, I decided to try my own wheat free experiment. A week in, I already started to feel better. I have more energy than I've had in years, I'm sleeping more soundly, and my level of concentration seems to be increasing (something I've been struggling with for some time).<br />The book itself is not written down, as are most diet books. As a matter of fact, this is not a diet book. It is an educational book about American nutrition - about something that should have been obvious to us all. A definite must read.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This little tale had a message in it and you can learn from the past of others and have patience and appreciate. The graphics were stunning, Best Gingy ever! Nice movie, I might try Temple Run Brave,lol
B00F91RYL8|4.0|But I just couldn't look away.  I loved the analogy about &#34;Mother Nature&#34; being a serial killer... that just blew my mind.  I'm not a Brad Pitt fan but I actually liked him in this one.  The zombies moved really fast and it just made me wonder how could you really ever get away from them. Some of it was just way over the top and just unbelievable.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|So many of life's experiences rest in the safety of a good outcome.  In this case, one wonders how one would do if, like Will Traynor, they do not.  But after reading this interesting and well-written story, it's plausible that maybe, just maybe Will's final experience had the good outcome he expected.  It's certainly food for thought.  Its also food for thought about how loving someone and respecting their wishes is truly the ultimate gift to give another human being.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Just on my first lesson, it is simple enough and easy to use, it helps if you know just a little about the spanish grammar.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|If you want to see an original idea executed buy outstanding actors, then this is the movie is for you. The only thing that failed in this movie is the editing, they left everything in, which made the movie too long.  If it was edited to maintain a cogent flow it would have been a great movie instead of a good one.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Liked the first season but the second is even better. Gets more into the characters pass and how everything came to be. Love how these characters are evolving and growing. Can't wait for season three.
B00F35BV64|4.0|The Family liked it, said not as fab as the first, I did my laundry, I was excited to rent it but lost interest for some reason after the opening scene. Oh well, I know it won't stop Trekkies. Live Long and Prosper!
B00EVN3JNM|4.0|Interesting concept, kept me guessing. Loved the magic tricks and the explanation of the magic tricks. Pay close attention to every nuance. I predicted the ending but my daughter didn't see it coming.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A typical Grisham masterpiece and of course a five star rating. I know that you will love this novel and recommend it to your friends.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its a classic game that helps to pass the time and doesn't require a lot of thinking, it is a fun game
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It does the job in a small light design. It is exactly what is described on the web page. Great!
B005544TRQ|5.0|My son got me hooked to this series. It looked like another spoiled lawyers show but it sucks you in and then your hooked to all the characters. I like how it gets you to cheer for the good doers and hate the bad eggs.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Andy Serkis is just amazing and James Franco. This had to be the best of the series, I would watch this again.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out at the theatres and loved it.  The beginning is a little odd but after that it picks up and the action scenes are good.  I saw it in 2D at the theatre but wanted the 3D version as I think it will add a little something extra to it (much like Star Trek Into the Darkness did).
B0074VTHKM|5.0|A surefire five star story. Grisham at his unbeatable best. I really enjoyed it despite the fact that it was a kid's book.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|What is there to say? Probably my favorite show to have come on in the past few years! Can't wait for season 4!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|My wife an I both know we saw it, but can't remember it at all. So, it must not have been bad and it must not have been good.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|5 EPIC STARS<br /><br />Steelheart was one of the most thrilling rides I've ever been on. Not that I expected anything less from this author.The man is beyond brilliant.<br /><br />The world building Sanderson comes up with is just off the charts. He is the most imaginative, creative sci-fi writers ever.<br /><br />The writing in this book was amazing and powerful. He truly brings everything thing to life. The characters, as always, were so real. I don't know anyone who can bring characters to life as well as Sanderson.<br /><br />Plot execution was brilliant to say the least, as it is in all his books. From the very first page to the very last sentence, I devoured this book. You will NEVER find yourself skimming through a Sanderson Sci-fi book. It's just that good.<br /><br />If you like books that are fast paced and full of shocking WTF moments. You'll love this.<br />Book 2 release is fall of 2014. Sigh... But, you can't rush perfection.<br />FYI- for those who hate cliffhangers. Book 1 ends, but is left open for book 2. I don't consider it a cliffhanger.<br /><br />If you haven't read a Brandon Sanderson book yet. You are seriously missing out.

B00BSZZA3I|3.0|The case fit fine the logo htc on the front of the case is were I have a problem. You can badly see it.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This is a second reading for me. Several years between them, but the second reading was better than the first. Read and savor!
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|I saw this movie in the theater and would never spend another dime on it again.  The graphics were poor, the sound mixing was shoddy, the acting was poor - especially by Will Smith.  The trailers made it look amazing but I was severely let down.  The story had promise but the production and lack of acting train-wrecked it.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|If you expect more than a cookie cutter action flick you will be disappointed. If you want a no brains involved good time then this is your movie.
B005WFUZTE|5.0|Megadeath continues to produce big music including a Grammy from this album. While so many other coast on the success of their past life megadeath continues to make music that they like and to that make fans keep coming back.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I love the concept of this soundtrack.  Such a great mix of 20s jazz music and modern music.  Plus, the artists on this album are so expressive :)  Thank you for wonderful music!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great book. Insightful, entertaining, depressing and well written. All women should read this book and understand how the justice system treats women.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|If you use your knife, it will need to be re-sharpened.  This will do the trick and is small and light enough to carry regularly.  Great in a pack or EDC kit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the whole series in a few days, I couldn't put it down!! Great writing, great plot, great characters!
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I found it to be creative and original in concept. It was a little slow in storytelling style. So sit back and relax I think you will find it worth the watch.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|You cannot ask for a better album. Dream Theater continues to push themselves into new realms of their abilities as well as keeping their style. Fresh album with fresh technical music. Don't pass it up!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but I am hungry to read a little every chance I get. I am only about 1/3 of the way through and I can already fill in some pieces of the puzzle left open in the previous two books in the series. Atwood has been my favorite author for 20 years, starting with The Handmaid's Tale.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Loved the special effects and the cast.  I will own a copy for my movie library.  Can't wait for a second to continue the story
B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks is the begining of the collection in my opinion.  Mallrats, Clerks II, Jay Silent Bob Strike back, dogma,<br /><br />There are a lot of now really big names in these movies.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I love the fact that it charges super fast.  I believe that it charges my iPhone faster than my iPhone specific wall charger.  Would strongly recommend it.
B003IWRE3I|3.0|If you want to see another movie about how man is destined to mess the world up, then this movie is for you. It is one of the better ones in that genre.
B006CA5NUY|4.0|In an era when rock is trying to keep its head above water Korn rocks with this new album to help bring them back into the spotlight of today's top bands.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|i did love it! it's quite the apocalyptic movie.. so a must-watch if you're into it! lots of action & suspense.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Khaled Hosseini's novels cover 2 or 3 lifetimes and you end up getting very involved with the characters. The same was beautifully done in A Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner. You fall in love with the 2 or 3 central characters (for instance, Laila and Miriam in the former and Amir and Baba in the latter). As you start knowing them, you feel sad for their losses, you rejoice when they succeed. That made his previous two books click - at least for me.<br /><br />Where this book lacks is that the author tells you the story of so many different characters in different chapters that you don't feel close to any of them in the end. Plus, unlike the previous two books, you get a feeling that there is no main plot in the whole book. In The Kite Runner, the plot revolves around Amir's burden of guilt and then his resolute journey to find Sohrab and make amends, in a way. In The Thousand Splendid Sons, one loves the way Laila and Miriam's friendship evolves and the sacrifices they make for each other and for the two children and finally how Laila finds freedom. In both cases, you feel glad when Amir and Laila finally triumph in their conquest.<br /><br />However, in this book, the author begins telling you a heart wrenching story of two siblings separated from each other and leaves it at that for the most part of the book. Similarly he introduces so many characters and tells you their stories, few of which are not even necessary (for instance, Adel and Gholam, Markos and Thalia) for the by-now trivialised main plot - which I am presuming is about the two siblings Abdullah and Pari getting reunited.<br /><br />However, to the credit of the book, Khaled Hosseini retains his poetic and lucid writing style, describes multi-generation characters and their relationships in the same intricate manner as the previous books. The heart rending beautiful fable that their father narrates to Abdullah and Pari, with which the books begins, deserves a mention.<br /><br />All in all,it's a good read, but disappointing as compared to the previous works.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|It was refreshing to read a different prospective from Anne Neville. Very good book. All that you would expect and more from Philippa Gregory.
B004SN8YXK|5.0|These shoes fit the way I thought they would and got here faster than any other products did. (I'm in the Army currently deployed to Afghanistan). I highly recommend these shoes.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|If you expect more than a cookie cutter action flick you will be disappointed. If you want a no brains involved good time then this is your movie.
159562015X|3.0|My wife already owns the book, but there is no way to take the test without purchasing the book. Quite stupid. I honestly have not opened the book because the quiz gives you every detail you would want to know about your strengths. Major flaw in their system.
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|I laughed out loud so many times when reading this book. The characters are great caricatures of the politicians, police and journalists that we've growm to live and hate in equal measure in the UK. There is a plot to this story, it is a mystery really, but it isn't to be taken too seriously. It's really good fun and I recommend it.
B000K3HTRY|5.0|Despite (or perhaps because) Maggie looking very similar to her brother, she is very hot. Luckily she is also a great actor (also like her brother).  Great film, makes me want to be a personal assistant some day.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works really great, cheap and effective, and no doubt is awesome,I would recommend it in a heart beat, and its awesome how you can dim it by sliding with your finger, and using music you want and like as the alarm sound
1400082773|1.0|Why bother reading a book supposedly written by Obama which in fact was NOT written by him<br />An IMPOSTOR!<br />The book in itself is very well written and not at the level of Obama
B0055OK2T0|3.0|It's not going to get anyone an academy award but, it was a fun movie.  It is worth the rent if you've seen the first Matrix too many times.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The reemergence of Danny Torrance was spectacular. A great King book. The True Knot is definitely one of his best villains as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The first few episodes of this season are not my favorites, but I think the last three episodes of the season are my all time favorites of the whole series.
B00EEXST2K|1.0|As I am sure the porn industry is a horribly horrible place to work, I am not convinced she was as innocent as the writers of this film try to make her out to be. also why is James Franco in everything?
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|The voice acting is bad, the physics are hilarious, however, it's one of the best gta style games you can get for kindle. Overall, worth the price for the amount of time you can kill.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This product is awesome! Walking Dead fan or not, this mini fish tank is super cool and creative. You put the heads and water in yourself and everything. I bought this product for my boyfriend's birthday since me and him love watching the Walking Dead, and we were very pleased. This item shipped to me quick and boxed very safe. This is definitely worth it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love EVERYTHING about this book!  Pam Grout lays it all out on the proverbial table just how to co-create with the 'Force Power' or God/Goddess, Allah, or however you address it. By the time you are finished, you will have undeniable proof!  I was even surprised by the outcome of the nine experiments she has you do, and I consider myself a seasoned metaphysician!  This book is fun and easy to read!  If you are looking for getting a firm grasp on how to make serious changes in your life then, I highly recommend this book!
B00CU9LHY2|5.0|This collection of some of my favorite Smashing Pumpkins songs ever, has been upgraded and redesigned into this beautiful boxed set.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love everything about Downtown Abbey: The costumes, the furniture, the jewelery, the accents.  I even enjoy the interaction between the family and the staff.  But I hate the way this season ends!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|From what I hear the original movie would have been good but as the last third of this film is really slow for any genre let alone a Zombie flick.
B009P3N1GI|3.0|This was a nice short story which as usual from Brandon Sanderson had at its heart a well rounded and believable protagonist.  However, it lacked a certain sense of tension or &#34;oomph&#34;, which I expected as the story was really about someone imprisoned looking for ways to escape.  As always his magic was well thought through and had that scientific ring to it which makes his fantasy believable.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|As said in the title, it looks great but every time i had to set the timer it rebooted my phone... not cool...
B00AESN8XY|5.0|great little time killer.  very addicting, yes you can buy the unlocks or be like me just play the game as is no extra money involved.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|This edition of the last amazing album from Nirvana is completely full of rarities. The attention to detail is also great.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love the show, I started watching after several seasons and was watching re-runs.  Like it so much that I now have all of the seasons and watched them all in the correct order.  Even out of order, they are still great.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Of course my title is referring to the character not the actor playing aforementioned Potter, as said actor is tragically creepy looking.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a must read, have tissues handy and be prepared to feel thankful for all of the blessings in your own life!
B0025X4PL0|5.0|When they broke up it absolutely crushed me because I never had an opportunity to see them live as I'd only just discovered them in 2010. How I never heard them before was completely beyond me. I'm almost ashamed of that.. Anyway, yeah, this album (though I recommend the UK version more because the addition of Voorhees at the end) is completely brilliant in every way possible beginning to end. It's inspired a lot of my own music.<br /><br />Farewell 'Size.. you'll be more missed than you can imagine.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Excellent!  I enjoyed it immensely.  Juliana Margulies was the perfect actress for that role and it was good you made it about her building her career while raising 2 children while balancing her difficult marital situation.  The children were delightfully interesting characters who played the parts of today's teenagers quite well.  The series involved so many different compelling characters going in so many different directions.  I appreciate that the level of complexity was just right and all the players' roles were well defined -- not blurred or confusing as in what usually happens when they make it that busy.  I don't know about everyone else, but it was very much like my real life.
B004J64QSI|5.0|World class performance which lacks a little in the theatrical, but excels in the vocal performance with the exception of the Jonas Brothers kid playing Marius for some odd reason.  Otherwise great performance with special encore with the original cast.<br /><br />Jean Valjean is in a league of his own, but this is definitely my most favorite casting on disc.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Even though the original book &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; was not nearly this happy.  Bravo for the new version.  Love the songs and the beauty of &#34;under the sea&#34;.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Look, I like my zombies fast, even though I grew up in the 80's. This particular piece is amazing on so many levels, and doesn't fall into the trap of being gory for gore's sake. It's closer to a thriller in many ways, which is the best of both worlds.<br />I know it is different from the book, but the way it was adapted is excellent, and I would say necessary given the book having taken place after the actual events (aside from the cleanup). Buy it, set it next too dawn of the dead (remake), 28 days later, 28 weeks later, and enjoy the panic
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|Love this game. I first had it on my computer, then bought it for my Kindle Fire, now have it on my iPad! Also have Letters To Nowhere 2!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have several devices including an android tablet and love kindle on all of them.  I can read, listen and enjoy my media wherever I go.
1594746168|1.0|I read that many peoples liked this book ... I had a very different experience reading it and, sorry,in my opinion, this was the worst book of my last twenty years of reading ... Luckily I had used a Public Library copy, loosing some of my time reading it but not the money necessary to buy it. Sorry again (for the people that like it), but yes, I had found this book slow, annoying, with unreasonable characters and unrealistic plot ... In conclusion, my amble suggestion is to use your time (and money) for reading something else.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Ok folks I read a lot of books and I only have a few that stick with me. You know the ones that you will hold on to and re-read over and over again. Well this one just made that list. I absolutely loved this book, the humor, the angst, and eventually the HEA. This book had me laughing out loud, full on laughing not just a little giggling. I love that this book is from HIS POV, not just chapters here and their. If your on the fence about this book just give in you won't regret it!!!
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I found this cartoon to be a bit boring.  Even the kids couldn't watch the whole show.  Usually love these cartoons but, gave my copy away to someone else.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't get enough of this game... Love it. Love the minions. This game is great for all ages. I will be playing this game for a long time to come.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Great idea for a script but way too many gaps in the making of this film.  Might be interesting for people who want to know how big time magic tricks are pulled off but as art, this is a lousy movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Oh um....Well pretty much i cant come up with 16 words  to describe how i used this product or how well it performed and the Title says it all.
B002N44XSG|4.0|Pretty good job only thing is that he didn't include Bob in any later books I hope he does in his next book that would be awesome.
B005544V6A|4.0|Suits falls squarely in the genre of shows that star characters who are talented enough to live above the rules that apply to the rest of the world.  Think White Collar, House, etc.  So if you're into that, this is a witty show full of smug, hypertalented attractive people.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Love the music and song used throughout the movie. It is just happy and makes you want to get up and dance along with the characters.
B0073PPNE8|5.0|I LOVE this one. It portrays the romance and hope of a two longing hearts in the midst of the heartbreak and despair of the Civil War. I could watch this movie every day !
B005CKPQNE|5.0|By far one of the best human studies I have ever seen.  Excellent series that will grab anyone's attention.  To fully appreciate the evolution (or deconstruction) of a desperate man start with season 1 and prepare to be 'entertained.'
B000UGZTQO|4.0|Nice mounting system, this is a critical component in the holding of the expensive devices and it works well.  Good grip!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh John Green, I have cried many tears for Hazel and Augustus. Fantastic book, it is a must read! Can't wait for the movie!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book and the series! Can't wait for the next book to come out! Couldn't but it down.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I really enjoy this series and already wanted the eighth season.  It is worth a look and collecting all of the seasons.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|So much fun I just wish I could play without getting coins. There are free scratch cards you get to do for free coins so it's ok
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great read. It is such a loss that  Stieg Larsson passed away, we are now deprived of his master pieces.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|So far its good,I've only watched the first disc,but I really enjoyed season one and season two! Looking forward to watching the rest if season three and cannot wait for season four
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|It was a Great movie.  I would have bought it if I would have known it was going to be that good.
B00EJYGQFG|2.0|Lady Gaga calls her followers 'Little Monsters', but I think she is showing little talent on this release.<br /><br />When listening to the 'Aura' EP, Gaga sounds like an inebriated Grace Jones at best. The music to this track is trying too hard to be techno-fun. By the time the music straighteners out and Gaga decides to sing (which she can do well), I was half-interested. Then she goes back to Drunk Grace. Rating: 0.5 Beats (skip it).<br /><br />On 'B**ch Don't Kill My Vibe, this is her attempt to get booty-bass cred. Including Kendrick Lamar gives this track attention and allows her to handle the hooks, making the short tune appealing. Rating: 3.5 Beats.<br /><br />'The Greatest Thing' is a typical Euro-Club featuring Cher. Gaga does not try to outdo Cher vocally and lets the flow of the music accentuate the lyrics. Rating: 3.5 Beats.<br /><br />Every major artist seems to want to attach themselves with a DJ. In 'Applause', Gaga uses White Shadow to mix together booty bass and club. The music s actually very well put together. Once again, it is Gaga destroying the tune with her falsetto voice. When she sings with her real voice, I like the song. When she doesn't, she is just strange.... again. Rating: 2.5 Beats.<br /><br />'Cake Like Lady Gaga'. What is this SHHHHHTUFF! She can't flow. Music sucks. Don't waste your time. -1 Beat.<br /><br />'Murder My Heart (featuring Michael Bolton) is the most radio friendly and radio ready on this EP. Infectious lyrics, slick mid-tempo ballad vocal delivery (coming from a non-Bolton fan) and arrangement. Why is Gaga listed on this track? She is barely noticable in the chorus. Bolton sang the whole song. He should have released this for himself. Rating: 4 Beats.<br /><br />'Applause' is typical Gaga-techno, but will get play because of the hamster car commercial. Gaga is being weird again with her deep voice again instead of going all out and proving she can really sing through an entire song. This has gotten old. Rating: 3 Beats.<br /><br />'Stuck on F***in You' is a folksy tune wherebthe music reminds me of Joan Armatrading in style. If Gaga did not sound like she was allowed to curse for the first time, I would have enjoyed it more. The infantile lyrics don't go with the song. It started with promise, but that's it. Rating: 2 Beats.<br /><br />Any cut on Zedd's album is better than this mess called 'Stache' he made with LG. Disappointing. Rating: 2 Beats.<br /><br />The remixes of 'Applause' are sub-par. Why include them if folks won't give it rotation? Rating: 2 Beats.<br /><br />I would once like to see if Gaga can play it straight and show her true talent. Madonna was controversial, but her presence was better. The music and vocals were at the forefront, not the antics. Overall EP Rating: 2 Beats.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I truly ENJOYED the story especially the twist at the end. Great job! I will recommend to all my friends.

B00F2LIV4E|5.0|This is definitely a return to original Dream Theater.  The musicianship on this one is to notch as always.  Mike Mangini really shines as a force to be reckoned with on the kit.
1401235425|5.0|I finished reading this awhile ago and I thought I post a review since amazon insisted on it. To be honest, I was really skeptical of the New 52 series. I thought it wouldn't be really good and there would be too many changes to the characters, but I was surprised at how much I really liked this. Batman is my favorite superhero by far and I think this was well done.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|The first book I've read by Steven Erikson, but will not be the last.  I originally bought this book on audio, but the characters, places, etc were too difficult to keep up with on audio and I was left confused and disinterested.  Because of the great reviews, however, I decided to download the kindle version which includes maps and a description of the peoples, gods, magics, and magical items.  The immersion reading was great for this extremely in depth world with its many characters and story lines. Most of the books I have read that introduced so many characters were bland to me because there was not a lot of character development and I could not make an emotional connection.  This book was different however.  I never knew where the story was going next with its many twists and turns, but I couldn't put the book down because I NEEDED to know what was going to happen to the individual characters.  I have already purchased the next book and cannot wait to get started!  I highly recommend this book for any who enjoy epic fantasy.  The writing is excellent and I never found myself distracted by poor writing or awkward dialogue.  Erikson is one of the best fantasy writers I have read in a very long time!  Unless you are looking for a light read, this is one you shouldn't pass up!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I have not use it long but for the cost it works great for me. I have not had a chance to use all the features but what I have use I like it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Book three was horrible. Apparently I like to punish myself. This was thee worst book out of all three. That is saying alot sense the previous two wasn't much better. However they were atleast somewhat entertaining. The third book was just overkill. She really could have told the stories of the characters with one book. Since all the charaters were not really that deep the book severely lacked charater development. I found myself skipping chapters and skipping sex scenes because it had become redundant. I felt the book had no purpose except to sensationalize sex. The was just mindless filter until she could get to the next sex scence. In conclusion the books serious was poorley written. Just because ou have a thesaurus does not mean use every word in it at random. Especially if they dont fit within context.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been waiting a year for this book (preordered for that long) and it was worth the wait.I love the way we get to see one of Steven King's most famous characters grown up,I often wonder about what happens when a book is done,and this is perfect.I'd like to see this approach with some of his other books,I don't consider that cheating about a book,but making the story even better.I've read all his books and will keep on as long as he writes them!

B0033H7VI6|2.0|I got the knife today. The quality of the sheath is shoddy. The strap that fits around the handle is on backwards, what the hell is this?<br />The knife itself is heavy which I wanted, however the blade is so friggen dull, I can't cut air. One can't even shave a small twig, and this is a new knife.  Schrade should send their employees to Mora and learn their craft. I did find a good use for the knife, so I decided<br />to keep it. The future of my \\"NEW SCHRADE is a doorstop.  After spending my money I don't feel llke I should have to do anything except strap it on and go enjoy the outdoors.  It is with regret that I am unable to do so, Thanks Schrade.  Until now, Schrade has always had a very good reputation with me and my friends.  Now I have to revise my opinion, and I am reluctant in doing so. With this experience, I do not feel like I will have future dealings with them.
B00CSSRPGY|5.0|This is another super fine recording by Eliane Elias ! She did some classic Chet Baker Vocal songs...very tasty !<br />Her Ex husband Randy Brecker, sounds great as usual, but he seems to solo much more lyrically and smooth as he ages !<br /><br />If you like her other recordings, you will LOVE this one !

1592402038|5.0|Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a very witty book that explains the misuse of punctuation through Lynne Truss's great sense of humor. In the introduction it states how this book isn't for everyone and one must be able to open their minds to truly become knowledgable about punctation. \\"Either this will ring bells for you, or it won't. A printed banner has appeared on the concourse of a petrol station near to where I live. \\"Come inside,\\" it says, \\"for CD's, VIDEO's, DVD's, and Book's.\\" As a reader you have to open your mind and think outside the box. Once the reader is able to come to terms with that they will then begin to learn the basics of grammar. Soon after the reader will realize that Lynne is very similar to your fourth grade english teacher and is a true \\"stickler\\" of grammar but is able to twist it in a sense that it isn't a lecture but a insightful adventure.<br /><br />It was a little difficult read for me because of the way I am with writing. I do not cringe when I see bad punctuation and it won't ruin my day. That being said I still think there is a need for this kind of book to make learning basic things more fun than normal. I have always dreaded punctuation, especially when it comes to learning more about it because that is usually followed by a long useless lecture of things that everyone already knows. This wasn't the case with Eats, Shoots and Leaves it truly helps the reader learn in a unfamiliar way which is new to many people. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to gain a better grasp on grammatical punctuation. Along with giving insight into punctuation it also debunks the common myths that being a grammatical stickler is bad. It shows that it is also a very good thing and can be used in a noble way to make the world a better place.<br /><br />-Connor K
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I hate zombies, but this movie had such a fresh perspective that I found myself rooting for R and his lady love.
B006LSZECO|4.0|would have love it more if the husband came out as the winner.  it did not end with my hero.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game I love it I am addicted on it know no reason to delete it is all I can say
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I usually don't go for this type of book, but so glad I broadened my horizons. From the very beginning, I did not want to stop reading.  Constant surprises at every turn of the page. I loved every bit of this book.oh! Did I mention I loved this book?
B003G4W49C|3.0|Children play too many killing games. Until they cannot tell real from fantasy. It becomes habit. Then addiction. Not good for them or anyone.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughter and we both loved it. We cried (warning you), but were both glad that we chose this movie.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|keep you interested and guessing the whole way through, but I like these fancy type books.  started reading book two the next weekend.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love this language learning app. I wanted to brush up my Italian skills before going to Italy in a couple of months, and I can tell it is already helping. The lessons are short with enough of a game feel to keep me at it. My only complaint is with the audio. I find it to quite garbled at times. If that could be fixed it would be perfect.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Got this app for my son and have playing it myself ever since. A very fun game to play for all ages.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Margaret Atwood is a wonderful writer. She is the queen of dystopian writing and MaddAddam is a great ending to her trilogy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed the game. loved how they mixed in the hidden object puzzles. wish it was a little cheaper though for how short it was.
B000FA5STS|5.0|David Baldacci always writes a book that will keep you so interested , you can hardly put it down. His books are very informative and<br />excellent choice of what is happening in the book. Start to read his books.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Gives you a different perspective on a part of history we need to remember. It's a keeper. I especially enjoyed the view of regular people during that very difficult period.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My daughter is 4 and can't really play this alone. I am not always sure what to do either. Need more clues. It's hard to find good horse games.
0385743564|5.0|The day I read this book I was very, very into reading it.  This is not an unusual occurrence, but  I was notably reluctant to do such things as put down my book and eat food.  (Eating is an activity widely recognized as good for continuing to live.)  This led to the following bit with my dad:<br /><br />  Me: So you know how it's a common premise in stuff for something to happen and people suddenly have superpowers?<br />  Him: Yeah.<br />  Me: What if something happened, and there were just supervillains?<br />  Him: No superheroes?<br />  Me: No superheroes.<br /><br />Basically, STEELHEART is about the world in which Superman is a bad guy, running the place, and there is no Batman with a Kryptonite-laced plan to stop him.  The only person who has any inkling of how to stop the invulnerable Steelheart is David, an eighteen year old living in Newcago who saw Steelheart bleed on the day he killed David's father ten years ago.  (This happens in the chilling prologue that sets the tone for how impossible it is to put STEELHEART down.) Now David is trying to team up with the Reckoners, the only non-Epics who fight back, to try to stop Steelheart's rule.<br /><br />STEELHEART is a fantastic book, whether you're into comic book-style stories or not.  It's got great, memorable characters.  Best of all, their physical abilities are second to their smarts.  How else do you take down someone who has superpowers?  David, in particular, is a massive nerd.  And it's up to the nerds to save the world.  The ratio of male to female main characters isn't perfect, but I do love that the love interest Megan is extremely competent and laughs at the hero when he absolutely and totally fails to be smooth.<br /><br />I loved the plot, which keeps things rolling, but throws several curveballs into the seemingly perfect plan and has enough breathing room for the characters to question what they are doing and why.  In fact, I never thought much about some of their motivations until the book brought it up.  I might've questioned them after finishing, when my brain shifted back to pure analysis, but no need since they're addressed on the page.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson is a talented science fiction and fantasy author, and I am quite happy he's writing some YA now as well.  Especially when that YA is as good as STEELHEART!  And let me tell you, I wish I did not have to wait for the next book.  If I had a superpower, it would be to will sequels into existence faster.k brought it up.

B0054LJGWS|5.0|These guys, authors, met as professionals and not taking themselves seriously, embarked on a journey of two professionals becoming engaged in enjoying themselves as friends and authors.  Wham.  A book of classic design is created and printed and brought to the public more as an afterthought than a determination.  Great reading.
8866135887|5.0|The product is great. It is totally as same as described. The calender helps me a lot to deal with the daily stuff. The paper is in high quality and I love the cover color. It is a really good product. Definitely recommend it!
1881273156|2.0|I did not think the book was as good as every one else did.  I could not believe some of the stuff in it and could not finish it.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|This DVD is good front to back. But Hendrix jumps out like Beethoven. He ended this legendary concert, and he ended any discussion about who was the best guitar player. And Joan B's voice was so beautiful that you might not be able to take it. Just watch and hear yourself.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is the best alarm clock i have! It just is awsome! It also makes a loud noise when u have the alarm set.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For the price, this little gadget sure packs value. Now I can cast programming to any TV in the house I want(They each have a chromecast connected of course). I'm satisfied. The only downside is that if you want to use a VPN service like HOLA unblocker, then you won't be able to cast.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|It's not just the plot that twists and turns in Atwood's newest novel. It is language itself, which makes the book both a puzzle and a delight to read.<br /><br />Margaret Atwood is among my favorite authors for many reasons. Her books jab the reader with wicked wit. The protagonists carry flaws as do the antagonists. Most of all, she is adept at satirizing the world we've made.<br /><br />In MaddAddam, Atwood finishes her trilogy of a post-apocalyptic earth. The saga is coming to a close with the survivors of the waterless flood gathering together for strength against their common enemy,the Painballers. Toby and Zeb have the most initiative. They take the most chances. Toby's nightly stories to the Crakers (recombined DNA humanoids) are full of both pathos and humor for the Crakers are so peace-loving that they become a target for satire.<br /><br />The novel brings out Zeb's horrific past and the continued presence of CorpSeCorps.<br /><br />If you read only one book this year, let it be this one. I don't think you need to read the first two before this. I read the middle book first, then this one, and will follow with Oryx and Crake.
0307279189|5.0|There's not much else to add to the tons of positive reviews on this book.  As for one who doesn't jog, hates jogging etc... I found this book well written, highly engaging, informative (I just bought a bag of chia seeds) and most importantly, inspiring.  An incredible book that should and will be enjoyed by most who read this gem.
0763644765|5.0|My son loved this book.  It was the only potty book that really caught his attention.  He is fully potty trained now, but he still likes to read it every once in awhile.  This was another book that we got from the library and hung on to until we couldn't renew it anymore.  There isn't a lot to this story, but you make up for that with expressive reading and talking to your kid about what is going on.  He especially loved the sequence where the kid sits on the potty and eventually gets the book and then peeks in the potty because he got tired of waiting for something to happen.  And of course, the underwear at the end.  He loves talking about all the underwear and the kinds that he wanted to have.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|There is only one problem with tihe app: it is not possible change the language, at least I do not find where.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|I hadn't watched this movie for a few years and I almost forgot how powerful it is. The subject matter is very challenging - no happy endings here. The acting is first rate. Ellen Burstyn should have won the Oscar over Julia Roberts pedestrian acting in Erin Brockovich and who knew Marlon Wayans was capable of this type of performance. Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto are great too.<br />The music is very dramatic and is almost a character unto itself. Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece in my opinion.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought it to see what all the hype was about.  Personally I like my Apple TV better.  The device serves a niche purpose but is not my goto device.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My kid loves this game, I downloaded it on my kindle. It kept him busy all day long! This is a cute game!
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Useless.  3 magazine type columns, only one contains stuff I might read.  The excess side bar stuff has been assembled into columns which are given equal value with the possible news stories.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I originally read this book through my school library. I then felt the need to reread it , so I took it out again. When I realized Amazon had &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; for $5 on Kindle I couldn't pass it up. This was the second John Green book I'd read, and it is still my favorite. I recommend it for people who like to think about books long after they've finished reading them. I want to teach a course just on this book. It's a goldmine of great quotes and great characters.  John Green is of a breed of now-rare YA authors that can write about life and death without a dystopian, post-apocalyptic backdrop. If I hadn't known better, I would have thought TFIOS had actually been written by a teenager girl- and I mean this in the pest possible way. Every time I read it I am astounded by its accuracy, humor, and heart.  And, perhaps most remarkably, it features a father who cries easy. Better yet, this father is not weak because of his tears, but perhaps a stronger character for them. And you will be, too, once you have dried your eyes after reading &#34;The Fault in Our Stars.&#34;
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is really fun, but it does get me angry if I don't have enough money. Still, it is a great game that lets you have some creativity.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|A lot of people will write reviews song by song so I won't even attempt. All I can say is that finally, Dream Theater has a drummer that is on the same technical level as the other members of the band. Not that Portnoy was bad, but he just didn't grow and evolve his craft as much as the other members have.<br /><br />What a difference a technical drummer makes... Mangini is great, but I will take the chance and criticize that their sound is becoming borderline too perfect, almost robotic. Upon listening to the more elaborate crazy parts, it's almost like 'is this really humanly possible?' - and while this is a compliment to their skills, not so much a compliment to the songs that end up being victimized by this virtuosity that causes loosing of their feel / groove.<br /><br />As for the sound quality of this production, I think they made the same mistake RUSH did, by overusing and abusing compression. This is not as bad as the latest RUSH release, but it has been obviously mixed to be played through iPhones, iPods, and other low accuracy playing devices. They should perhaps have released an \\"audiophile edition\\" with much less compression in the mix, more dynamics.<br /><br />And, as a drummer, of course I'll say Mangini just needs professional cymbals. Those Zildjians he uses do a disservice to the sound of the band. He should try Paistes - it makes a HUGE difference - but of course this is irrelevant to all fans that are not drummers.<br /><br />Overall a great album, extremely complex, worth having in the collection. I just wish the mix was less compressed.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|This movie is excellent when you consider it from the perspective of a father.  I may be reading into this but personally found a great deal of symbolism and a fantastic message.  Smith gave this picture to his son, not only for his career but as a message to him to forever reflect on, it is beautiful.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I will no longer be watching every episode of Downton Abby as I have for 3 seasons for the creators & writers of it have shown their desire to rely soley on sensationalism with their writing and plot lines. I had felt I had finally found a decent show on TV that wasn't full of profanity, constant sex scenes, and an uplifting family full of differing opinions and views but still loving and supportive. It was an invigorating, refreshing, humorous drama.<br /><br />When the creators & writers decided that the best way to end a beautiful birth scene that brought renewed hope & love to the entire family was to tragically kill off the ecstatic baby's dad, it was truly ghastly. It was such a forceful smack in the viewers face that it has left me, personally, with a distaste and disdain for the entire show. I have dozens of friends and family who have loved and anticipated each episode; there is a general consensus amongst us all that we no longer wish to see anything that occurs within Downton Abby.<br />I watch the high quality & well made shows of BBC because they don't typically strive for the &#34;shock and awe&#34; sensationalism that has been on display this last season.<br />I'm only sad I've wasted so many hours on nothing more than a glorified, pompous soap opera killing off two of the most loved, relatable main characters in the same season.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Love this game. Like all the challenging levels it has. You never get bored playing because of all the different levels and options you get.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|I just can not say enough about how much our whole family all 3 generations just love this movie. Great family entertainment.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Everyone in the family loved this movie!!!  It is a very cute, funny and entertaining movie for all ages!!!  A must see!!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|characters are complex and realistic. Great exposure about the legal system. Superb acting by all.<br />Love the various relationships and their ups & downs.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|An amazing show that will keep you wondering what happens until you watch the next episode. And when you think you have it all figured out... Be prepared to be amazed.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Another great movie to continue the story of Iron Man. The movie has action, a plot, and a nice ending. Would recommend to any Iron Man fan.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is another very addictive, fun game.  This one really gives your brain a workout!  I think you will like it.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Despite the reviews this book received, I felt it was poorly written. The writing was choppy and lacked cohesion.  Gramatically, I was surprised, and extremely bothered, by the number of incomplete sentences.  It is hard to believe that this book is regarded as acceptible literature for school students since it is riddled with poor sentence and paragraph structure.<br />Here is just one example:<br />&#34;The monitor gone....I won't feel it tingling and taking up the heat when I shower.....<br />( Next paragraph )<br />And Peter won't hate me anymore.  No, Peter was too dangerous.  Peter got so angry.  Brother, though.  Not enemies, not friends, but Brothers--able to live in the same house.&#34;<br /><br />I appreciated the author's introduction describing how he came to write the story.  He should have left it at that.  I did not care to read all the letters the author received describing how the book was so great or how the book changed their life.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|i was a bit hesitant to spend 5 bucks on an app (i'm cheap),<br />but this is a very good photo editor, well designed for tablet<br />editing with excellent results, very nice! it is well worth the 5!
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|Sure the number of doubles are close enough to be believable, but when I get 80% of my doubles sitting on the rail and the app gets 80% of its doubles when ending the game, the authors can not explain that. The app wins opening roll 90+% of the time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning. Not exactly a difficult book to read but one that was really enjoyable to sit down and read for hours. It had a great set up and flow through the entire thing. I think I read this as a child but don't remember much. As an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone that likes fiction.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|Very difficult to navigate and I kept looseing the sound and then could not get it to change levels when I finished one. Will not play this any more - very nerve racking !
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The setting is Victorian era England. The story encompasses the haves and the have nots in  such an endearing way that you feel as if they are your own friends and neighbors. You are drawn into each character's life and they joys as well as struggles quickly. This is NOT one of those &#34;stiff upper lip&#34; types of English shows. It is a portrait of the times, rich in humor as well as romance budding amongst the old and young people. Once I started watching, it became a quick favorite. I am now halfway through the fourth season and I began this journey a week ago! Fine for all family members, this series will soon be a favorite of yours too!
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I loved Iron Man, so I decided to watch this.  It was a good movie, but really slow in the beginning.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|Well, anyone who is an AIC fan will know that this is...not...AIC. However, in it's own right, it's a pretty rockin' CD, if not a little contrived. Plus, he does have a similar sound to Layne so...yeah, there's that.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Can't wait for the third installment, if it ever comes. This &#34;waiting for the next book&#34; thing is becoming prevalent...
0385743564|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read. When I thought about the rating I wanted to give it, all I had to do was think about how quickly I read through it and how satisfied I was with it, which led to the 5-star rating.<br /><br />It is about a world filled with super-villains and normal people. Ten years ago, people began to change and develop super-powers. Called Epics, each one began to terrorize the populace. One Epic in particular, Steelheart, took over Chicago and murdered the protagonist's father.<br /><br />The protagonist, David, is out for revenge on Steelheart...and he alone has the clues that could lead to learning Steelheart's weakness. He saw Steelheart bleed...and he is determined to see him bleed again.<br /><br />This was an absolutely enjoyable read and I could barely put it down. If you like sci-fi or superheroes, then I suggest giving this book a shot. It is definitely worth the read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!! Such a great heart-warming story. The characters were richly described and became real people in this book.  I will definitely look up the authors other books.
B00F35BV64|5.0|can't wait for jj abrams to do to star wars what he has done to star trek<br />this movie was fun, good dialogue, action packed
B00171EO0I|5.0|What an incredible movie. I could watch this a million times and never get tired of it. It is so touching and heartfelt.
0762439009|1.0|package seemed awesome at the time i purchased it, but unfortunately not all contents were promised as it said in the site. there was no patch of The Dude and no magnet. This thing sucked!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Full of surprises and fun to read. I especially liked the professional audio version. This Sci-fi  series promises to be quite entertaining and I am looking forward to the next book. My son, who is a physicist raved about these books, and recommended them to me. He was right, they are great fun and very believable.  J. A.
0790731452|5.0|Thank you so much! It wasn't in the best physical condition but the movie played just fine and I still love it!
B001MTENOC|5.0|This was a good read.  I got a lot of insight and different viewpoints through his hypnosis studies.  I compare it to &#34;Your Soul's Gift&#34; and &#34;Your Soul's Plan&#34; by Robert Schwartz.  Good similarities, just different modes of interpretations.  Schwartz used mediums which revealed much of the same conclusions.  I would definitely recommend this read.
B001EPYQO6|5.0|For any movie I try to suspend my disbelief before watching. It's just for entertainment.  Troy was very entertaining.  Stoy was decent and acting was good.  A good time.
B008JFC6F0|5.0|This album is awesome its just there was a problem with the delivery date, i have prime so it was supposed to be two day shipping but it turned to three, wasnt guaranteed the day it was supposed to be delivered.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|Complicated story.  At times I got lost in the development of the story.  Not as straight forward as I prefer.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Great movie, great book. Glad I was able to get a copy to keep with me. Thank you amazon for e-books
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Better than Sword of Truth or even Wheel of Time.  Better than most of the D&D books. I had already read them but want to re-read them and the paperbacks were given to family members, soooo, I bought Kindle bundle.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|Just could not get pass all the snooping this app wanted to do in my personal contacts, emails, etc..  Evernote was recommended by one of my member organizations so I wanted to try it out.  Just not for me.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This series is so well written, and excellently acted, that I never have to pull myself back into the story because a bit of action didn't fit, or some plot point was illogical, or an actor was out of character. It all flows seamlessly. The characters are so real, and the challenges they face so intense or seemingly hopeless that I'm glued to my iPad for every episode. And there are so many twists and surprises that you can never be complacent about how things are going to work out. Or even who's going to win in court. And the political insights are as fascinating as the legal machinations. Throw in many touches of humor and you have this compelling, delightful drama. Can't wait for Season 5 to begin.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I thought the movie was worth the money to rent.  I don't think I would buy it, as it was not as good as the first in this series of star trek remakes.  It was still entertaining.  I did get my monies worth.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Great B-day Present for my boyfriend. He got a new record player so this was perfect! Shipping was fast and effecient
B0040I09RM|5.0|I loved it! Season 1 was awesome. Can't wait to see what happens next. I am hook! Charlie Hunnam...hmm yummy! There was no problem watching any of the episodes. I recommend this show.
B009GED3HS|5.0|One the greatest shows ever. Period. Once I started watching this show I just couldn't stop. You grow to love every character in some way.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has it ALL!!! maps, multiple location settings, Doppler... I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this app for everyone!!!<br />Supper easy to use. I can change locations whenever I need to. The only adds scroll at the bottom. No dealing with adds while loading. I wouldn't change anything.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is the best game that I have on my kindle. Once I start playing it, it is very hard to stop.
B00C5R7F8G|2.0|This author needed an editor to tell him to STOP WRITING.  He introduces minor characters, how and where they met their wives and then changes topics in a new chapter.  This is an important story but it could easily have been told in half as many pages.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought the books could not get any better but I was wrong, he's topped Tolkien! I am hooked! Ready for the next one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great follow up to The Hunger Games. The way this book ends makes me anxious to start Mockingjay.<br />Hope the movie lives up to my expectations
B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|This review is for the Target Deluxe Edition.<br /><br />My first real time Cher album purchase was It's a Man's World.  I have been a fan ever since.  Believe and Living Proof were obviously dance themed projects.  Closer to the Truth is a nice representative transition between her dance albums to her previously more ballad/adult contemporary albums from the 80's/90's.  Essentially, the first half of this album is what made her insanely popular again when Believe came out.  The second half is more self-titled, Heart of Stone, Love Hurts.  A great combination.  With all that said, there are some excellent songs, a few ok ones, and only a few misses.  The rating system I will use is A-F.<br /><br />1. Woman's World - B  (I understand why this was a single.  Not my first choice, but I get it.)<br />2. Take it Like a Man - A  (This should be the third single.)<br />3. My Love - B  (Not single worthy but not skippable.)<br />4. Dressed to Kill - C  (This should have been a RuPaul song.  Too campy.)<br />5. Red - B (Not single worthy but not skippable.)<br />6. Lovers Forever - C  (This should have been a slower song.)<br />7. I Walk Alone - B  (Enjoyably different.  Worth the listen.)<br />8. Sirens - A+  (Best song on the album.  NEEDS to be a single.)<br />9. Favorite Scars - A  (Refreshing NON dance song or power ballad.)<br />10. I Hope You Find It - A  (Glad this is a single.  Would have released Sirens before this BUT it should be marketed.)<br />11. Lie to Me - B  (I can see where this is resonate with some listeners.  Not me so much.)<br />12. I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream - B  (Good song.  Enjoyable.)<br />13. Pride - B  (Fun song.  Lyrically, it sounds like a song we've already heard though.)<br />14. You Haven't Seen the Last of Me - No grade - (Glad it is on an album BUT it already had it's run with Burlesque.)<br />15. Woman's World R3hab Remix - No grade - (Don't care to listen.)<br />16. Woman's World Jodie Harsh Remix - No grade - (Don't care to listen.)<br />17. Will You Wait for Me - B  (Different for Cher.)<br /><br />A - 4<br />B - 8<br />C - 2<br />No Grade - 3
B00594XOZU|4.0|This App Barely Works It Was Ok And Then It Stopped Working All Of A Sudden Someone Needs To Fix This---!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great movie for children and adults  Great color and animation. Would highly recommend. Have watched several times  something to keep in the library
B00A285OOW|5.0|This book had an interesting version of Henry VI's life and his wife Elizabeth. It takes you unto a more personal level through Elizabeth's eyes. I loved the book and can't wait till the next one comes our.
B000000W6F|5.0|My copy which I've had since the early 90s when this was first released got too scratched up and wouldn't play anymore.  Got a replacement which was missing back CD artwork (no biggie since I have the older one still) for a steal!  The CD was in perfect condition with no visible scratches or imperfections.<br /><br />If you like the Pumpkins and all you know is later stuff, do yourself a favor and get this CD.  It rocks harder than anything else they did.  Billy's guitar work along with James' is kick ass.  Jimmy's drum playing is like none other - so hard, fast, and rhythmic.  He is awesome!  And it was produced by Butch Vig. I mean, come on.  Doesn't get any better in my book.<br /><br />This album kicks ass from the opening track to the very last song.  Classic.
0312243022|3.0|Well I now need to watch the movie of this to see if it helps in my understanding of the book.<br /><br />I liked the writers style and it was quite easy to follow, despite being written over three very distinct times. I didn't think I was enjoying it for a while but then kind of got drawn into it.<br /><br />I must admit I completely missed the link between a couple of the characters over time and I am interested to see if this was just me because I was distracted when I was reading it or whether the rest of the book group missed it as well.<br /><br />I didn't have high hopes when I started this book but was pleasantly surprised at my level of enjoyment of it. More a 3.5 out of 5 but not quite a 4 so rated at a 3. Not a rush out and read book but, if you stumble across it and have nothing else to hand, then not a waste of time either.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|The final nail in the coffin of our relative &#34;humanity&#34;.  An innovative look at the necessity of acceptance, forgiveness, and the release of the species from the obligation of dominance.  Great series of a world through a glass not too much darker than our present one.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|Silly, goofy, and wonderful.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson having a blast while making us laugh!  Will Ferrell is hilarious!!!
0345529057|5.0|The book set came in wonderful condition, there was no issues during shipment and I received them fairly quick. I'm excited to start reading!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|yo to all you minecrafters out there or non ones here's my advice...PLAY IT ITS NOT A WASTE OF MONEY IT IS ONE OF THE MOST AWSOMEST GAME EVER ON THE APP STORE AND THIS IS NOT FOR NERDS ITS FOR EVERYONE SO BUY IT NOW AND NO I'M NOT GETTING PAID TO SAY THIS AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I'M STILL IN CAPS,there much better,but what I was trying to say is you need to by it it is AWSOME and yes, I ment to put on CAPS!;-)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had heard about this book because it will be a movie soon, so I tried it. It kept me coming back to see what would happen next.  Good writing!
B00F5F9WF4|4.0|Drake is uplifting on the new album and showing his versatility as a top artist in this game called Hip-Hop.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Haha, this is the most overrated book. Terrible prose, unrealistic scenarios, overall a crap beach book. It's like a collection of old Playboy magazine stories
B00F96P8S4|5.0|This is the best album I've ever purchased!!! Every single song speaks to me in a different way.... I LOVE CHER
B00005BL2A|5.0|Depeche Mode - Exciter (2001)<br /><br />I'm one of those guys who wasn't sold on this album when it first came out. To me it sounded limp and mushy. EXCITER didn't excite in quite the way I had in mind so I passed on the latest DM slab that year. Fortunately I have since picked up the album and have come to revel in its luxuries. EXCITER is top quality Depeche Mode, a cohesive artistic statement with some real gems too.<br /><br />\\"Dream On\\" - Driven by Martin Gore's tasty acoustic guitar lick, EXCITER's opener has a great beat and a stuttering energy that belies a subtle, twinkling intensity. \\"Can you feel a little love?\\" *****<br /><br />\\"Shine\\" - \\"Soft Romantic\\" is a good label for this new DM style full of smooth disco and vintage soul touches which makes itself known for the first time on the album with this song. But it also launches into a classic Depeche synth attack at the chorus: \\"You've been hanging from a rope of mediocrity....You've got to shine for me.\\" *****<br /><br />\\"The Sweetest Condition\\" - A strange Egyptian feel engulfs this swaying, seductive track. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"When the Body Speaks\\" - No one had heard a DM song quite like this: 50s jazz guitar and borderline sappy violins overlay this undeniably beautiful number. It will depend on your taste as to whether or not this track will do it for you, but it's a good song regardless of the style. This six minute track has a firm bass pulse and shining guitar lines as well so it's not like it doesn't sound at all like DM. ****<br /><br />\\"The Dead of Night\\" - The nasty one. A spasm of electronic noise greets the listener from the get-go and it just doesn't let up. This does indeed sound like a cross between DM and Marilyn Manson as other reviewers have pointed out, and a very successful one at that. *****+<br /><br />\\"Love Theme\\" - A churning heartbeat rhythm starts off the track as sensuous 70s-funk style soul slides in, complete with squiggy Depeche touches. A very satisfying 2-minute interlude. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Free Love\\" - Insistent pulses gently propel this ode to naked emotions and generosity. A VERY mellow and romantic DM song. *****+<br /><br />\\"Comatose\\" - a pleasantly dreamy track full of trickling synths. ****<br /><br />\\"I Feel Loved\\" - Sporting a jaunty, classic Depeche sound, this is an upbeat and extremely cool tune with loads of corrosive synths. *****<br /><br />\\"Breathe\\" - almost a classic blues full of contemplative keyboards and romantic overtones. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Easy Tiger\\" - is another two-minute instrumental interlude, quite nice in fact (****). It segues directly into...<br /><br />\\"I Am You\\" - which pours on the romance and features wonderful vocal melodies from Sir Gahan. This one is smooth, relaxing and very moving. *****+<br /><br />\\"Goodnight Lovers\\" - Icy shimmers greet our ears and melt into a supremely soulful track with excellent vocal harmonies very reminiscent of sounds from a bygone era. A really sweet song. ****3/4de. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Free Love\\" - Insistent pulses gently propel this ode to naked emotions and generosity. A VERY mellow and romantic DM song. *****+<br /><br />\\"Comatose\\" - a pleasantly dreamy track full of trickling synths. ****<br /><br />\\"I Feel Loved\\" - Sporting a jaunty, classic Depeche sound, this is an upbeat and extremely cool tune with loads of corrosive synths. *****<br /><br />\\"Breathe\\" - almost a classic blues full of contemplative keyboards and romantic overtones. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Easy Tiger\\" - is another two-minute instrumental interlude, quite nice in fact (****).

B007F5SG22|5.0|Courage is as courage does, and this lady does it well. What a shining example for us all, especially in the coming troubled times when Islam, with the assistance of the usual well-meaning &#34;useful idiots&#34;, tries again to follow the example of the &#34;perfect man&#34;.<br /><br />Read this and be warned!
B00846REIS|5.0|This love story took my breath away. There are just some things I wish they would have revealed in this book.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is the best i love dumb ways to die i first played it on my cousin's Iphone and when it came out for kindle I was excited because i have been waiting forever but then when i was playing i figured out you cant pass the plane level and moose because 1. Kindle Fire doesnt have the little mic thing and 2. you can only put 2 fingers on one screen and you need like 4 or 5 so i only recommend this game to kindle players if you dont mind the plane level and moose
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What an amazing trilogy!!!!!!!! Book 3 does not disappoint! Well not too much anyways, but you'll have to read to find out why.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|If you love the cartoon like i do its really cool to play the game..you get to try to save them from all the dumb ways they die..the reason i gave it three stars is because it gets very repetitive and at some points almost impossible..its a really great game for wasting a little bit of time but i dont find it good as a long term game...p.s.the ads are REALLY annoying and are full screen commercials instead of just a quick pic here and there.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It was a good book. It had my attention all the way through. The last half of the book was WOW!! I didn't see that coming. Read it.,you won't be sorry!!?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Funniest game I probably own. The minions make me laugh that I think the neighbors can hear me. Definitely download it.
B003MXD694|5.0|I love the voice acting in this movie.  The cast does a wonderful job portraying the characters.  Watch this movie!
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Interesting book, I would recommend it, but wish the author was a nicer person. She got on my nerves a bit
B0098460O4|5.0|Love these kids who remain true to themselves in spite of all the hype and accolades. And talent? Wow!<br />Saving up for their second album
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book, it was so heartbreaking and amazing and wonderfully written, one of my most favorite books ever. I think everyone should read this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|awesome.. All 3 books are great, but I think this one is my favorite. I can't wait to see how the movie turns out. I hope it does the book justice...
B006PIXKVW|5.0|I remember watching this movie when it first came on television. I liked it then and I still like it now. When I saw that it was free to watch on my PRIME membership, Well it was a no brainer. It is still a sweet movie to watch, now with my kids.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I chose the rating because once I started reading it was very hard to put down.  Just the right amount of everything. I would recommend this book to everyone who likes these kinds of books.. Loved it!
B007SSDBBM|4.0|I really thought this movie would be corny.  But it really was a cute and enjoyable movie.  I'd sure watch it again and I don't say that about too many movies.
0440237688|5.0|In this unspecified empire (neither the USA nor the UK, where no<br />president or monarch is referenced, nor any monetary system is mentioned since there is no need for it) Jonas is about to turn Twelve with his Age Group. But on this official Naming Day he is forced to wait until the very end of the ritualized ceremony--with formal apologies for the ensuing emotional inconvenience and inner turmoil of confusion. He is stunned to learn that he has been selected by the Council of  Elders to become the apprentice of the Giver.<br /><br />  Highly revered but isolated from daily human interpersonal relations the Giver is the Receiver and Keeper of Public Memories--a kind of social archivist for the Community. The only man who knows the truth about their flawed history and brutality: war, poverty, disease, crime and most of all--Pain--all of which have been eradicated from this seemingly perfect society.  For the Community is sheltered and Protected from all stressful knowledge of its own violent past--where people repeatedly made the wrong choices. It is decreed that only the Giver may--indeed Must--retain these terrible memories: to advise the Elders when consulted.<br /><br />  Here in his safe, sterile utopian world Jonas never had to make any decisions; he did not get to choose his life work, nor even would he mature to select his life partner. In fact, as the future Giver, he is instantly treated with utmost respect by everyone-- even adults; best of all he is free to lie--even to his own family. But will the freedom to learn all suppressed knowledge affect his satisfaction with his reprogrammed existence? The quality of visual Sameness is valued in this community, where color has almost been eradicated. Thus his green ayes make him an object of curiosity--and a potential candidate for this exalted position. Ah, but what happened to his young, green-eyed female predecessor?<br />Will Jonas prove just another complacent cog in the wheel of revisionist<br />Anthropology? Must he endure the pain of past generations--just to spare the masses of the present both physical and mental anguish?<br /><br />  Jonas come of age in a rush as he experiences the agony of all mankind and realizes that his own father has lied to the family about his role in Nursery.  He now knows that the aged are \\"Released\\"--not to a lovely peaceful place--but actually receive lethal injections and are shunted out through tubes to ignominious burial. It's all a sham--a lie!<br /><br />Unusually compassionate by nature Jonas fears that Gabriel, a toddler who is not responding to extra home nurturing, will also be Released. Determined to save the rejected child AND himself from a life of mental torture the youth defies convention and decides to escape this stagnant empire by bicycle. It's a race against the search planes as he struggles to reach the outpost, where real people still live in a world with color. Hands down, one of the best YA novels I have ever read, THE GIVER is for \\"adults\\" of all ages!<br /><br />NB: The grim old man depicted on the cover is presumably the aged Giver, who instructs young Jonas in his crippling lifestyle. Lois Lowry took this photograph herself when visiting Sweden. The only loose end she admitted to was not having explained how the Birth Mothers conceived; most likely by in vitro--since sex was taboo and sexual urgies were suppressed by daily pills.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Absolutely fell in love with Nora Jones when I first heard this album about a year ago. Beautiful voice and passion in her music.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife has a great set of characters that work very well together.  I like this show more than any show I have seen in awhile.  It has drama, a little suspense, a little laughter and it is just a great show.
B004LWZW24|1.0|I have not yet viewed this DVD - so ask me again about it in a few weeks.  I want to view it before seeing/ordering Insidious Ch. 2
B00136NUG6|5.0|Best Band ever assembled with incredible notes & lyrics with quality !  Vocal, instrumentals, and you can SEE them as they were !
B00018D44U|5.0|I'm in love with Nora Jones music, This album is just amazing! It is just relaxing and uplifting, really brightens my day and mood .
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this is the best show I have watched in a long time.  I think they have a great cast of actors that work very well together.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I'm still reading all of Lee Child's books and I'm over half way there and Die Trying ranks as one of his best.  I simply could not put the book down.  I loved it!  I find Jack Reacher to be such an interesting character.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I Loved it!  Great action sequences and a good story, everything that I have come to expect from this franchise.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really like this book. It is very well written.  It reminded me of the Kingkiller books by Patrick Rothfuss.  If you liked his books I would highly suggest this one.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|This one had all the FX requirements, and it had a nice plot, but it didn't have all the creatures I expect from these shows.  This movie had more of a family feel to it, where the emphasis was that everyone cared for each other.  That's great, but that should not have been the central theme.
B00F91H666|1.0|waste of time. couldn't wait for 'the end' to appear on screen. acting was fair, premise was absurd.stay far far away
B000SEI618|4.0|When I started reading \\"The Sea,\\" I was a little distracted by Banville's prose. His frequent use of unfamiliar words was, at first, a little off-putting. But as I continued to read, I understood the beauty of his choices. I never had to grab a dictionary as definitions were pretty clear from context and the root or origin of the words. By the end, I was fascinated by his artistry.<br />In an early scene, the lead character, Max, returns to a resort village he visited as a child. Banville wrote a beautiful sentence: \\"It was like encountering an old flame behind whose features thickened by age the slender lineaments that a former self so loved can still be clearly discerned.\\" The story is terrifically sad and the characters compelling.<br />I had the pleasure of meeting John Banville at a Book Fair in Italy last week. Seems like a very nice guy, and I am now shopping for more of his work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone that loves a good book. Starts kind of slow but stay with it, when it gets good, it gets really good! Has some twist. Worth the read, no question!
B008YI99IE|5.0|Good DvD,Too bad for me because I reordered it. I like the fact that it is a wide screen format and although I don't have a high definition player I can still see the whole screen.
B007EC27QM|1.0|I couldn't have been more pleased and impressed when I purchased this application, BUT when I used it the first time for real later on, it wouldn't work unless I was connected to the Internet.<br /><br />For security and battery life, I keep my Kindle Fire disconnected from the Internet, which makes this application WORTHLESS.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great casting, characters, scripts, acting, humor, and drama. I try not to watch them all at once. It's like trying not to eat more than one potato chip, piece of chocolate or bite of dessert.
1250037751|1.0|This book was chosen for our county's \\"United We Read\\" program.  I stopped reading it at page 116, when, video gaming and boobs were used in the same paragraph.<br /><br />Poorly written, childish, garbage.<br /><br />Are they sure this was written for adults?
B00E95ED32|5.0|The track (Number 8) \\"Lay Me Down\\" is absolutely the best dance track I have heard.  The killer vocals of Adam Lambert and the funky guitar of Nile Rodgers are intertwined masterfully by Avicii to make it a one of a kind electrifying updated disco song that will make you jump, dance --anything but stay in your seat.<br />That Adam Lambert's singing ability is \\"insane\\" like Avicii said.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As I was reading this novel I was impressed with the subtle implication that what we don't know or understand we fear and we must contain that object or person. Thankfully Jack cannot be contained and therefore lives another day to confound, confuse and sometimes play (in a synical way) with those who mistakenly believe they have power over him. However, they will never learn that when you have right on your side and the thugs are very short sighted you will always win.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|If you're a guy...get it.  It's just pure entertainment.  Heck with story lines but it was quite novel in a way.  Also, seeing Adrianne Palicki in that red dress is worth it. :-)
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|this guide did not help me at the upper levels i am at. it may be okay for lower levels.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I loved the way Cassandra introduced Clary Frey to a world she didn't know existed. That being said, it's kind of obvious that this subject has been dealt with before in several other works as well. The plot does have interesting twists and turns, yet manages to stay on track. (Now if only the movie adaptation would have stuck to the book.) The character development is quite good as well. The story is not like Twilight, no matter what you hear!
0321934318|5.0|A great way to learn how to work with Lightroom.  Solid and useful information with a certain amount of whimsy to lighten things up.  I was really put off by the steep learning curve presented by Lightroom, but Kelby makes it very manageable.
B000W8HC8I|4.0|Would like to chat with him someday (If he is still alive). If 20% of it is true it's a great real story. Three quarters through it and really look forward to the end. I hope he played his cards right.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|At first I didn't think I would like Downton Abbey...Thought it would be too slow for me. But after only 2 episodes in season 1 I got hooked. I watched season 3 in 2 days! You won't believe the season ender!!! Can't wait for season 4 in January.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Arrived pretty fast and was everything i hoped for until i dropped it and it broke, other than that though which was my own fault, it was perfect. I love MCR and this is probably my favorite album.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is amazing, it's just what I needed it for! My kindle was running low on space so I went online and someone suggested using Clean Master and I can finally erase things I don't need. Very easy to navigate and use, a must buy app in my opinion.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|Read as far as the first experiment. Did the experiment. Either nothing happened or I recognized no gift. The author must be receiving it in royalties. If I win the lottery ill change my review otherwise save your money.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Gives me a complete picture of my Wi-Fi enfviornment. I know why my speed comes and goes and now know where to move my channel.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely sexy and hot, yet sweet.  Love me some Gideon Cross! Angel <3 Mr and Mrs Cross.  Soulmates. Love. Romance
B0058DRSHW|5.0|This book starts of with listing the visionary companies and what criteria they are using to consider them as visionary companies.  You may agree or disagree with them but it is always important that you know when the author/s make it absolutely clear the context they are using.  It also does a great job of describing why they felt these companies need to considered a visionary companies and what made them one.  This book was recommended to us for our Strategy course at University of Chicago Booth School of Business by our strategy professor.  I would definitely recommend it.
B007X709PE|5.0|If you're a fan of motogp and especially a fan of Valentino Rossi you will love this video.  With great race footage and an inside look at the mental and physical struggles of the riders it will bring an even great respect for these people and this sport.  Rossi Greatest Of All Time.
B008M87GJK|5.0|No need for any other news app if you have this, in my opinion. Unbiased, which I feel is most important and they ask the right questions.  I like the 60 second news casts because I don't have to search the news channels on TV to see exactly what's going on around the world.  I would suggest this app to anyone who wants to be truly informed on current affairs.
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|I bought this album for the track downtown and  the whole album was very good.  I'm  glad  bought the album
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was recommended by my Strategy professor at University of Chicago Booth School of Business.  I still remember the main character of the book, Santiago, and his journey.  There is many elements of strategy that come up through his journey.  I would definitely recommend this book for a nice easy read.
B00027JYLC|5.0|great movie, entertaining fast paced reccommend for horror fans or fans of old hollywood films in general. easy fast shipping
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful! So spectacular from cast to settings. Outstanding writing !!!!!!!  I'm  anxiously awaiting the new season.  Romance and drama, what more do you need?
B00F91SCXC|5.0|awesome movie! I  actually went to the super market the very next day and bought the movie to add to my movie collection
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I could not get it to load on my tablet but I called Amazon and Justin was so helpful in helping a computer illiterate.
B0007LGCB8|5.0|This is my second pair.  It’s exactly the same as the first.  The first one was a little big and the elastic string that tightens the sandal wore out from me constantly tightening them.  They lasted two years and they would have probably lasted two more had it not been for the elastic.  They also started to develop a funk because I wore them without socks.<br /><br />I started to ware socks and, after six months, the new pair still looks and smells like new.  I put them in my shopping cart and waited for my size to go on sale.  I got a great deal that way.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Its really simple. This purchase will be the best tv series on bluray/dvd you can buy. Look at all of the 5star reviews.
B0096NCVAE|5.0|This item is in perfect condition and the delivery time was a planned!<br />This product is similar than other products that I bought!
0345803485|4.0|This book came in great condition and was sent in USPS. It took a lot longer than the other items on the same day considering it came from a city close to me. Other than that Great Book for a GREAT price.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it has a lot of fun things to do. I hope they make a third and combine everything into one. one this bad is it gets hard way to fast.
B00ELD3MUW|2.0|Since Kindle doesn't let you know that Flash Player is NOT available on Kindle, it makes one search for another alternative.  The alternative is Flash Installer, which stops working when it feels like it.  Very disappointed that this was not &#34;fixed&#34; by Kindle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|quiet.. contemplative.. wonderful brainwork ... I love trying to work these puzzles .. I do them when I'm looking for somethink to focus on for relaxation ;)
B002PMPTIO|5.0|GREAT MOVIE.. Even my husband who isn't a Scifi fan really liked this movie. Great action, great story line, great characters..Great Movie.
B00F2J2LRE|5.0|I think this is the best cd/album Cher has recorded.  The tune, I Hope You Find It takes honors.  I can't wait for the tour.
B00CGP0D1S|5.0|Ang Lee's \\"Life of Pi\\" is strikingly beautiful in many ways, from great cinematography to the story being portrayed.  You need to be prepared is half of the movie is graphics with music.  I will not take the time to compare and contrast this film with others as it is so unique in itself.<br /><br />I have to admit that I have not read the novel by Yann Martel and I am sure that a lot has been left out.  I will need to read the book to find out what was implied; unless of course the screenplay went off in a different direction.  You will want to watch this film over again after the shock value so that you can pick up the nuances that you missed while you were speculating on what was about to happen.<br /><br />The basic story is about a young man named Pi (Suraj Sharma) whose father owns a zoo.  Throughout his life Pi wonders about what Douglas Adams calls \\"life the universe and everything.\\"  Because of business concerns his father packs up the zoo animals on a freighter setting out for Canada.  Due to a mishap Pi no longer has to speculate but actually lives \\"life the universe and everything.\\"  We travel with them through his trials and tribulations wondering what we would do in that situation.<br /><br />One can come away from this film with a new insight or at least say that they saw a movie that was strikingly beautiful in many ways.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot BELIEVE that we have to wait until January to again entwine ourselves in this web of stories. The acting is superb, the settings magical and the characters have become our friends. Because I had not watched the series when originally broadcast, I had the pleasure of using these downloads at my leisure - a delightful way to become addicted.
B000002UCN|5.0|Thank you very much! Item was well packaged and arrived in great good condition; I am enjoying my new music!
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|doesn't stick to the storyline. The older movie with Robert Redford is much better to many fantasy features tat caused my headache<br />while watching
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Lots of fun! My kid especially loves the fact that you can be on the &#34;dark&#34; side.  Can be addicting, so beware!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|when they show up at my house they love watching this moovie colorful with such a good music ,they dance to it.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|This series is well written, well acted and engaging. Not entirely historically correct (not meant to be) it does allow one to engage in the history of this ruler's time.  I feel the nudity and sex were truly overdone, but then it is a paid cable drama. Looking at this series without the historical eye, one would enjoy it for what it is.
174316498X|1.0|It feels redundant to try and add to what amounts to some excellent, articulate reveiws of this book, but I really felt the desire to express my opinion.<br />Reading this book has led me to wonder if most authors have a limited amount of books in their capabilities as authors.  Some definitely seem to have just one.  Kate Morton might just have had three.<br />The first three books were wonderful reads, but this one was such a struggle to get through!  In fact, I never did finish it.<br />I'm not an author, but is seems like perhaps Ms. Morton is committed to a formula, and is unable to evolve past it.<br />The story just didn't seem inspired.  I feel that perhaps writing has lost it's magic, and become a \\"job.\\"<br />The writing of this book was very technical and careful, but the inspiration of her first books was gone.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|His voice may be deeper than on Honky Chateau but the spirit and Bernie's lyrics are there. Can't stop playing it which means my choice for best song keeps changing.
0064430227|5.0|My grandkids love that color purple so when I saw this I said to myself I will get it for them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this is a really great game because it's like your in the real movie and it is really run to achieve most of the stuff!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  The characters were all believable and the acting was stellar.  I hated to see it end.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|This show is very addicting. Don't start watching it if you don't plan on watcing episode after episode and losing out on sleep because of it, because that is just what will happen once you begin this series!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This I watch every so often ,I love that an old man is afraid to fall in love with a woman close to his age.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is just a fun game that requires a little or a lot of though to complete depending on the difficulty level.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I love Sophie & her fun writing style. This was playful, fun, and easy book to read. Can't wait for more from her.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Same as Lord of the Rings 2nd movie.  Bored through a lot of this, but in the end, I didn't hate it.  Further, the Hobbit probably didn't need to be broken into three....as every scene is just too darn long with pregnant pauses of the most magnanimous kind.  I like the whole series of the Lord of the Rings...just wish they could move this one along a bit quicker.
0553208845|5.0|This book is mainly a walk with 2 men they grew in frienship when one of them dies is really sad,at the end of this book I though I was missing something I called the Library and asked their answer was:you read the book.
B005LAII4E|5.0|it is just exactly what it pretends to be.  An action/adventure with enough action to keep you satisfied.  If this becomes a series I will purchase the next one.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Very unbelievable , I can see why it attracted Hollywood to make a movie. I will not see the movie. No way can I see Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher six two and two hundred pounds. That is even more unblievable. With that said, the book was hard to put down once I started reading, very we'll written. Good characters.
B00BHMF578|2.0|We see enough radicals in our real lives.  This movie tries so hard to be historically accurate, but it was really not a spellbinder in reality.  It was sad, depressing and unjust in so many ways.  Perhaps I just cannot stand Affleck and anything he does.  Out of four of us who agreed to rent this together, NONE of us had the energy to sit through more than 30 minutes.  I don't typically just turn off movies I rent, but this one was THAT annoying.  Please, DO NOT believe this movie as history.  It's a sensational desperate attempt for Affleck to reinvigorate his otherwise sad career.  It begs the question, how DID his publicists pull of the Academy Award?  Perhaps there wasn't much more to vote on in 2012.
0671449028|5.0|I got this book mainly for them,I read stories before they went to bed they are 7,6,4 yrs old I still read for them ,they loved it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this novel which is a journey of a very intense relationship.  You are never quite ready for what happens next.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a great time waster and is fun too. Definitely worth the download. Easy controls, upgrades and many levels of fun.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|The cast is terrific, the subject matter sweet and kind.  All the actors here are amazing, if you are a fan of any of them, this is worth the peak.  It's not a spellbinder...just a joyous easy movie.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I LIKE THE MOVIES TO BE LOYAL TO THE ORIGINAL BOOKS. THERE WERE TOO MANY UNNECESSARY CHANGES IN THE MOVIE SCRIPT. THE MOVIE IS NOT SO BAD BUT I COULD HAVE BEEN AMAZING..
0440245931|5.0|If you haven't read this book, read it. It's better than the movie. I started this book while visiting relatives in Michigan, and did not get a chance to finish it before leaving. I received it very quickly, and was able to pick right up where I left off.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book!!! Very well written and it pulls you in very quickly. Hopefully they get to make all 3 books into movies.
B009ZQJ0ME|5.0|Excellent sci fi dystopian future type film.  There aren't a lot of these types of movies around nowadays.  It's not super high budget so the effects can be cheesy at times, but overall the coolness factor is high.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game! It is very addicting and fun to play...especially since Halloween is coming up. I recommend this game for everyone and its also great that it is free!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was fantastic!!! It kept me wanting to keep reading and not stop! I can't wait to start the next one!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|After placing and waiting 3 weeks for this to come in, I finally received the Chromecast and began my streaming journey.<br /><br />First of all, the instructions were fool proof.. Once you plug the device into your HDMI port (I had to use (included) extension cable) the TV turns on and displays what to do.  I used my iPhone to visit the website displayed and downloaded the Chromecast app.  The app opened and requested access to my Wifi, from then the Chromecast connected to my Wifi and it was all set up.<br /><br />I used Netflix to test out the unit's functionality utilizing my iPhone as a \\"remote control\\" and albeit there was a 2-4 second delay for \\"processing\\" the show which appeared on the TV was in beautiful HD and the sound was clear and crisp.  I even enabled the closed captioning and it worked flawlessly.<br /><br />My one and only gripe is that I could not send the sound to my receiver (not sure why) and was forced to use the internal TV speakers.<br /><br />Although at the moment the 'thingy' only supports Netflix and YouTube, it is so very well worth it.  $35 well spent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I too PLAY long and often.  FUN FUN<br />CUTE NEW GAME AT GREAT PRICE.Try it today<br />You will love it.<br />Poo
B0040I09RM|5.0|The first Season is my all time favorite Tara and Jax are my favorite to watch all the time.&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; 3333
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|Of all the games that play like a leveling board. This one plays quite well. What you do it control your kindle from left to right and top to bottom like a table top leveling device. The ball goes through different mazes...moving, jumping, picking up stars and finally going down the hole at the end.<br />This is a well thought out game. I played different levels always finding different problems to overcome. If you like balancing acts. This is the game for you.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Ordered this item on 9-18-13; delivered on 9/21/2013.  Excellent service - speedy deliver - arrived in excellent condition - very satisfied.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Very pleasant read.  The plot is predictable.  The romantic construct employed by the author---the communication of emotions through  the old fashioned language of flowers--is delightful.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I love every season of SOA can't stop watching no matter what happens on the show. Charlie is smoking Hot and he's a incredible Actor(:
B00640UICA|4.0|This is a cute little game where you have little beings join hands together. The puzzles can be quite complicated due to different beings having different amount of hands to connect. If you like fun mind challenging games for the afternoon. This will keep you entertained.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Another great Angry Birds game, you can play the light or pork side.  Plays great on my 1st gen kindle fire,.
B005544V6A|5.0|Fast moving, intelligent show with a cast of wonderful characters.  Every fall when the season ends for the year I find myself mourning my guilty pleasure of tuning in every week.....Best summer show on TV.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this book and I have shared it with several friends who are now hooked on the trilogy as well.  You will really need some time on your hands, once you start you wont want to book the book down and then you will get book 2 right away.
B0061S0A64|4.0|If you like techno and are into making music. This program will intrigue your creative mind. I played with it for awhile and enjoyed making funky beats.<br />If you are a music maker. This is a quick way to experiment and create different music beats and to expand on them maybe with other software.<br />All-in-all, I thought this to be a enjoyable and creative techno music maker.
B00F5F9WF4|5.0|I'm already personally a drake fan but this album has something for everybody.  better than  his previous albums...my favorite songs right now are &#34;305  to  my city&#34;  and &#34; language&#34;  really you can jus put in the CD and press play and let it ride.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I purchased the entire series - (5), for my son for Christmas last year - it was nice because I pre-ordered season 5 and he received it later in the year when it was released - a belated Christmas gift, he was very happy!!!
0307744434|5.0|This book is a unique excellent read!  It is hard to find a good read like this, I have recommended the book to several friends who also found it a great read.  The imagination that went into this story and creation is unparalleled.
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|This film goes down as my favorite Shakespeare adaption. I was always one for the dramas and tragedies, but this adaption exceeded my expectations.
B000FC10MU|5.0|This is an excellent book, thought provoking, insightful. Standard Neil Gaiman. Obviously controversial--if you want to give this to someone make sure they aren't easily offended by assaults on religious belief. Completely worthwhile and fun.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I've never had an Android game before this one that I went out of my way to play. Usually I pull out my phone for a quick game of something while I'm sitting around waiting for an appointment, but I found myself playing 10000000 while I had other things I could and should have been doing.<br /><br />The basic gameplay formula has been used by half the games released in the last decade, and is nothing particularly thrilling, but the adventure/RPG layer that goes on top of that is what made this game so addictive to me. I had a great time and played it to completion, and would gladly buy a sequel!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great Story.  Could not believe the ending.  A really spell binding read. Hard to put it down.  Very smart writing.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|A truly memorable film about the unglamorous work of evangelism. The physical beauty of the area was breath taking. Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro were great as the man of the cloth and the man of war. The music was perfect. I cried as the Portugese came and destroyed the mission. A mighty confrontation between religion and politics.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|First listening disappointed.<br />Second listening normal condition.<br />Third listening it's DT!<br />Now I listening over and over again....<br />I am so happy to hear you again.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I took my daughter to see the movie Wreck it Ralph and one of the songs off this album was in the sound track and the first time I heard it &#34;What do I stand for? What do I stand for&#34; it was so different and uplifting from the regular hip hop bafoonery I pollute my ears with. I love a good majority of the songs on this album. They make you wanna sing like no one's looking at you. So sing!
B0081336FO|4.0|Mostly well written. Sometimes a bit hard to make out the thick English. Sherlock has a tendency to go off the rails but most of the time a good performance.
B00005JKDR|5.0|What a cool movie, this is one of my favorites when I first saw it with my 1 year old son. Problem is that whenever I watch MONSTERS, INC. I become a kid again and that rush takes over when I laugh too loudly. As they say, you're never too old to have a good laugh, especially when you see yourself in the movie doing hilarious pranks with these two trouble monsters. I LOVED THESE FUNNY FELLAS!!!
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|Can't get it to work, nothing happens, I wish I had not waisted my time or my data, Thumbs down
0061478784|5.0|In the land of Ingary it is well known that it is a misfortune to be the eldest child in a family of three.  Sophie is the eldest of three so it is no surprise to her when she is cursed by a witch.  To break her curse she seeks out the Wizard Howl who lives in a moving castle in the wastes.  Howl turns out to be much more difficult than she imagined possible.  Howl and Sophie have to work together to break the curses the Witch of the Waste put on each of them.  They struggle through all sorts of adventures as they try to break the curses.<br /><br />I initially read this book after seeing the film adaptation.  I loved the film and wanted to read the source material.  The film and book are quite different but they are both beautiful stories.  The characters are compelling and you can't help but feel sorry for poor Sophie as she struggles with the effects of her curse.  There is more to these characters than meets the eye.<br /><br />If you enjoy stories about magic, witches, and wizards then you should read this one!  Diana Wynne Jones weaves a beautiful tale of magic and just a little bit of mayhem in her amazing new world.  I want to know more about the world of Ingary and it's people and inventions!
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|if there was any thing I'd change I would have preferred seeing Brad Pitt been more clean cut. I would of expected to see the person in the lead roll looking more professional. Other then that the movie was very well written, Pitt played the part very well.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|great book. I found  the farseer trilogy on a  top fantasy series list and was pleasantly surprised to find that Hobb had continued the series. true to the original
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|This is a great addition to post-apocalyptic sci-fi. I think one of the drawbacks to many stories is that they show the survival of a person or small group of people, and then don't touch much on what they do afterwards. The post-apocalyptic genre is really good at showing how people live after a disastrous event, but it is not often done in sci-fi movies. You mostly see it in the horror genre (specifically, zombie movies). This movie incorporates Zen-like philosophy (which people have falsely labeled as Scientology propaganda), as well as interesting and seemingly-plausible futuristic technology. Will and Jaden Smith do a fantastic job of portraying a necessarily militant future, and both play interesting characters with more depth than a lot of reviews give them credit for. Will Smith is on another level from other actors, and his son seems to be picking up his father's style of learning and acting. I won't go into specific details for the movie, but it is well worth watching if you enjoy the genre. I would classify this as more of a thinking person's sci-fi movie; yes it has a lot of action, but it can be traced back to the main character's struggle for control of their self, and it is very entertaining to watch.
1423140605|4.0|Rick Riordan can weave a spell with words. He cleverly disguises actual knowledge in a compelling story. This book picks up right after the previous one ended. The story follows the seven members of the prophecy as they try to save their captured friend and shut the Doors of Death. They have to follow the clues that only Annabeth can see and solve the mystery of the secret \\"Mark of Athena.\\"<br /><br />Riordan describes the ancient gods and goddesses in interesting ways, you get all of the myth in a compelling new package. His descriptions are subtle and keep even someone fascinated by Greek mythology guessing about which god or goddess the characters are talking to until the last minute. The only downside to this book was the ending, I didn't want it to be over! So many unanswered questions and loose ends left, but it does ensure that I will buy the next book to find out the answers. I just hate having to wait for the next part to come out!<br /><br />If you enjoy Greek mythology or adventure stories you will enjoy this book.
1455121924|5.0|Wake up and realize how bad wheat is for you and all the damage it is causing to our bodies.  It's very difficult to stick to this diet as they put wheat in everything but if you do you will feel so much better!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Kids love it and it helps pass the time on long trips my wife and I think the.app is great fun also
B00B19G01C|5.0|I thought this movie was a good scare.  Also loved Jeffery Dean Morgan's role in this film. Definitely made me jump.
034552554X|5.0|I love this book.  The characters are very believable and the references to flowers and their uses is interesting.  Highly recommended.
B00F8GYC1Y|2.0|The PAID VERSION has basically finger traps! If you have fat fingers and happen to click just a HAIR off of where you should, ads will open up your browser OFTEN! That's acceptable for a free version. That's completely unacceptable for a paid version! Otherwise, well done. But, the inconvenience outweighs the fun and the game got uninstalled. Shame......
B009G41CG2|2.0|The graphics are too hard to read.  I have yet to complete a game without the site closing down.<br />Recommed only for people with lots time and sharp eyesight.
B000I9W08I|4.0|It is a favorite with me.  I love Barbara In it and my total<br />favorite was Louie Armstong.  I think  he died not too long<br />after that.
B007SGM084|5.0|I just decided to read the book b/c I found out that Charlie Hunnam (my future husband) is doing the movie and I had to get the books... I love it. I'm almost done with the second book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This bingo game is awesome. I keep wanting to play. I highly suggest this game. Hours and tons of fun!!!
B00BMNM4H6|2.0|the game is ok but just requires to much energy for me.I prefer more playing and less thinking. To challenging.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|With such a great cast you would expect something so much better then this..  Poorly written, and poorly directed. Wow
B007QWY1QE|5.0|Tango's family is not like anyone else's family and if Tango could talk, he would tell you he is just like anyone else. He was raised in an egg, he is loved by his family, he is visited by many children, he lives in a penguin house, he lives in a zoo, and he lives in the city. The only thing different is that Tango has two daddies.  How can that be do you ask?  Tango came from an egg from another penguin couple who had more than one egg. Unable to care for more than one egg at a time, they gave this beautiful egg to a loving couple Roy and Silo to care for it. Roy and Silo loved each other but since they were both males they could not create their own egg.  They built their own nest and wanting their own egg to nurture and love like other couples that they saw, they adopted a rock.  They loved their rock but the rock did nothing but sit inside the nest as the couple sat on it day in and day out.  Oh, Roy and Silo watched over this rock like it was a beautiful egg.  They wanted an egg so bad but since they could not have one, the rock Roy found was their only solution.  The zookeeper got the idea of helping out Roy and Silo and that is the beginning of this family. This book tells the story of the beginning Roy and Silo and it ends with Tango being a big penguin.  It talks about the zoo, his life with his family, the other penguins in the zoo and an author's note in the back about how this story is true with more facts about the story.  The illustrations are a soft watercolor and are beautifully done. I think it is a great story.
B001BANK32|5.0|It is very hard to block out the movie scenes that are SO memorable and in my opinion iconic in nature, but it is worth it to read the book. Stephen King was very displeased with the movie and thought that it did not represent the book well - that in itself was motivation to read the book.<br /><br />I wanted to renew the story before Dr. Sleep came out and I am so glad I did. It gives a new definition of scary. This is the raw, real kind of scary where you will check under your (hotel) bed at night.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This game holds my attention.especially when i am trying to keep as many lives as possible in tack so that i can continue to play without buying more........
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just like the rest of this series this book is awesome..... can't wait for the next one to come out
B000HIVOFU|5.0|Buy this Album and you will know what I mean. As long as your system is SACD compatible you will truely hear a difference.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|To me, this is a favorite out of all the apps I have tried. The puzzles are fun and eventually get challenging enough to keep things interesting but without becoming too hard to sap out the enjoyment.<br />I noticed occasional updates for a while that added new puzzles, and that was appreciated as I have run out of new ones. Looking forward to any new updates, and hopefully they will come.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Could not put the book down!!! I Will definitely be purchasing the second book as soon as I wake up.
B000TDGGVU|3.0|Revealing.....but DRY. Could not finish. Thorough but drags. Dry dry dry dry dry dry dry no choice but to quit
B00AYE8C70|1.0|Have downloaded it 10 times .....every time it gets stuck in the synch mode.I would not get it if you want to talk.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm a huge Hunger Games fan. Have been way before this movie came out, so when I heard they were making a movie of this, I actually got really scared. I know countless book to movie adaptations have miserably failed, and when I went to the midnight release for this, I had very low expectations. I walked out very happy overall, surprised at how good a job they did. Of course, there were some minor flaws in the movie (shaky cam, the ending coming to a abrupt halt), but overall it was an amazing job and an amazing film. The acting was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, and Woody Harrelson all were A+++ performances. The rest of the cast was good too (oh! and Elizabeth Banks as Effie was perfect!). I could go on and on about The Hunger Games, but it would be like....a ten page paper hahahaha. Overall, I give this movie on a scale of 1-10 an 8.5 (yeah yeah, I know I gave it 5 stars, but since I can't give it 4.5/5 stars, I bumped it up :)<br /><br />I can't wait for October 1st, as Catching Fire tickets come out!!! If your planning on going to see Catching Fire in theaters (hunger games sequel for those that don't know), I'd buy your tickets in advance!<br /><br />May the odds be ever in your favor :)
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I was enjoying the game,but was being bugged with excessive pop-ups. Then my game was locked up and I ending up losing everything,including $20 worth of pearls I had just purchased. When I got the program back up I was starting over. Not happy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. I am so happy I did. This book kept me guessing the whole time. The first chapter is mind blowing. Can't wait for more! Keep up the good work Mr. Howdy and I'm looking forward to more.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Love it. Reminds me of Atari graphics. The minimalist design is actually perfect for this game. Very clever. Well done.
0307279189|5.0|First, it helps that my wife and I and my mother have taken the Copper Canyon train tour.  Now I know why we had armed escorts.  It was fun to read about the towns we visited or stayed in.  I don't run.  The book got me back on our treadmill and walking around our local 3 mile lake (Greenlake, Seattle).  The characters are all amazingly portrayed by the author to be very different and very interesting.  I learned about sport history, foreign cultures, human development and interesting people.  Great read!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I know you'll read just the title cuz your lazy like that but if you are reading this review... THIS IS AN AWESOME APP best Learning languages app on Kindle Fire! MUST HAVE!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|And overall a good read, but unfortunately sometimes almost unbearably creepy, including the end. Not a nice way to end the day...
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a great book.  I was sucked in after the first chapter.  I found myself ordering pizza for the kids because I couldn't put it down to cook.  Christina Baker Kline did a great job keeping the reader wanting to know more.  I even dreamed about it when I went to bed.  I read it in two nights which is a record because I'm pretty busy working and running kids around.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is the best game ever. You should try this app<br />I love it so much I think there should be a epic 2 that would be a lot of fun
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Found myself laughing out loud. This book was funny, sexy and entertaining. I loved the characters and I  didn't want it to end.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I rated this as a five star because it is one of the best and different programs I have ever watched. I like Chandler Riggs in the role of Carl because he can turn his emotions on and off at will. I am happy with the service I received on this movie and would indeed do business with this firm again.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game on websites, but I never even thought of its potential as an app! The game is wonderfully addictive. It's simply amazing. The vivid colors are amazing! I tried playing it on small devices such as an iPhone, and it was a failure. The game is much better if played on devices with larger screens as a Kindle. Otherwise, it's a great app!
B00422LESO|5.0|I usually read three different genres at a time. This was refreshing and light after the exhausting battles of book 4 of the Game of Thrones and a detailed book on American history.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Enjoyed this movie,fast paced action .good casting.of course love all Star Trek.would watch it again.loved this Spock.<br />Love the freedom of watching new movies on Amazon!
B00FEHXISA|2.0|I felt the film was rushed through, ending disappointing. Ending graphics effect poor, too much SGI not enough believable scenes.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Funny, but also a little disturbing when I remember the whole premise is that they are 15 & 16 year olds in high school. Otherwise, I love it.
B00821OX98|5.0|I always wanted to watch but my daily life got in the way.  Now I can log into prime when I have a spare 45 minutes and stream an episode.  Great bonus of having a prime membership.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Played along with my kids. We all enjoyed finding clues and advancing through all the levels. Some were very tricky. Need more rooms!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I became immersed in this book from the beginning and couldn't put it down. Moriarty weaves a web of what appears on the surface to be ordinary characters in a small Australian town. She goes on to let you into their more complex personalities and their secrets, some small and one HUGE that changes their lives forever.
B00E7SXPVW|4.0|One of the best albums of the 90s. Honestly, one of the most important rock n roll albums ever.<br /><br />But this re-issue is a needless cash grab.<br /><br />Twenty years ago when In Utero came out, all of the rumors about how Steve Albini's mix was \\"better' and the label \\"made Scott Litt go back and make it more commercial\\" were blowing up all over the place.  This week those were released finally, and I can say that... yeah... Steve Albini's mixes were horrible. They sound like very good demos.<br /><br />But poorly balanced. You can clearly hear where he changes from one vocal take to another (they're not even panned or EQ'd the same) and the guitar solos are so loud they sound like someone playing over their boom box. Vocals are WAY to low in the mix, kick drum isn't there at all... It's horrible. Kind of hard to listen to.<br /><br />The new 2013 mix isn't much better. Adding the silly harmony vocals right from the start slams it right out of the gate, not giving it anywhere to build to... so it's like having someone yell in your face the whole time.<br /><br />If anything, this album vindicates Kurt and Scott Litt's Fixer Mix that went back to finish the record and make it sound good but not over-done.<br /><br />Nice to have all the B-sides but we didn't really need new mixes of Sappy or MV.
B009G41CG2|4.0|This is a great game to play.  It is a big challenge to try and beat this game.  I really enjoy playing this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game with lots of fun and great minion action that is fun for the whole family bananas bananas bananas
B00280LYIC|4.0|As a substitute teacher, I often pick up a book from the teacher's desk and read during quiet periods. That's how I got started on this one and just had to finish it. The story is familiar to anyone with kids in this age bracket (ten to thirteen). It is well written and worth the read even if you have seen the movie.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|I loved the series. Just wish it would have lasted longer.  Glad they made a movie to finish it off.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love it because it teached my little cusin he just want to play over and over again and im like you learn in this book
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Glad to have this on my kindle. Sometimes I need to balance my checkbook or when there is a sale and I need to know how much % is off an item.
B0036FYO12|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT, IT SHOWS YOU HOW YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST THE GOVERNMENT, IT SHOWS YOU<br />HOW EVIL THE GOVERNMENT IS AND WILL KILL YOU IF DONT AGREE WITH IT
0596009208|3.0|THE contents of the book is very good but the quality of the printing is bad, the images are not clear and is difficult to read. I do not know if just the case of the copy sent to me or if they all come like that. but am very sad
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Game keeps you on the edge of your seat, it keeps u wondering what's going to  next . Great, great great
0062255657|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who thought it rivaled the Narnia series.  No way!  The plot was silly, the characters were not developed in any way, and it was actually boring. Was it written to be made into an animated feature like Coraline?  If so, it is too scary for younger children and older ones would not like it because the characters are 7 and 11.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|This is a easy read with some very easy to comprehend advice on self discovery! I recommend it for anyone who has problems fitting in,
B003U53GK8|1.0|Beginning and mid-season story lines do not matter in The End.<br /><br />The resolution is the biggest ass pull of all time. I should have stopped watching after season 4.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My needs were simple and this app met them. I just needed a calculator while using my Kindle Fire without having to reach for my phone. On the plus side the numbers are huge so I don't have to strain to see.
B008JFUO72|2.0|I'm sure there was a story in this film somewhere, but if so it was too convoluted.  Without special effects there would be no movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not a prude. It just read like a Harlequin novel. I expected it to be better written. I would have expected Anastasia to not ALWAYS stumble, trip, and blush..couldn't she have been a more three dimentional character?
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Absolutely what I expected!  I have missed several shows and now I'll be able to catch up.  This show is very well written and the characters are very enjoyable.
B001BANK32|5.0|Wonderful! Great story and enduring characters. No wonder King wanted to remake the original film. I recommend this to anyone.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Well written. Started watching the series but decided the book was probably better and I was right. The book was so much better.
B000SGRONM|5.0|I chose this book because I have loved everything he writes and this is no exception. If you don't mindsore tummy muscles from laughing. Read this book!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Simply the best keyboard for any android user, astonishing interface and fascinating variety of settings make it a must have.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|I used to love the app but the recent &quot;update&quot; broke the whole thing, now it won't work at all. I reinstalled it three times and all I get is a &quot;Facebook stopped&quot; message and then it closes itself. So disappointing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really handy for homework when there's no calculator around. Easy to use, very useful, especially if you can never find your calculator.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|This movie was so-so. It had a few moments, but when one watches the Walking Dead and then sees this movie, well, considering the amount of money and stars involved, it was just so-so.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is similar to subway surfers. it keeps me distracted and is super fun.sometimes I like to challenge my friends
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Insightful exploration of why racers race and dogs are loved.<br />If returning could only be so. I was truly touched.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 11 year-old son was  reading this, and asked me if I would read it too so that we could talk about it. SO much to talk about! What a perfect book to read at the beginning of middle school. I imagine that every child can identify with Augie as he bravely embarks on his new life at school. This is a book about kindness, and bravery, and the simultaneous desire to find yourself and to fit in that every adolescent faces. I highly recommend reading it along side your child.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great follow up to The Shining. It was great catching up with Danny Torrance again. Now to find another great book to read...

I've tryed restarting my device, deleting the kik app and downloading it again, turning my WiFi connections on and off, and connecting to a different network. How can I get back into kik?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Anyone who's been on the internet long enough has heard of this book, where you follow the story of two cancer-riddled teenagers in love. It's not revolutionary, it's not groundbreaking, but it does get sad, very, very fast. This is one of those books where you walk around in a daze after reading, not sure how life can go on around you when you've had every emotion wrung out of you in such a way. Give it a read, it's definitely worth it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|this was a really cute game but it takes forever to get enough coins and gems to buy what you want. so you end up having to buy stuff with real money so that kinda sucks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was curious as to all the hoop la about this.  I will certainly read the other two books soon.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. It gives u lots of different places to go to and hear the different languages. I really enjoy the chats from people all over the world nice people to talk to.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|The LotR and Hobbit soundtracks are brilliantly composed, bringing to life every emotion from the films without the dialogue or visual cues. This is one of the very few soundtracks that feels fresh and new every time I listen to it, even when I've sat down for eight hours straight with the album on repeat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND IT IS FUN TO PLAY AND I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY SUBWAY SURFERS CAUSE ITS FUN AND COOL
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I like to continuity of the story but still not sure what all the hullaballo was about.  It is well written.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Claire Daines is very much at the top of her game as the brain Warped Cia Agent... Sadly she must say goodbye to<br />her true Love Brodie and shows her stiff backbone as she returnes to the CIA at the end of the season... Sol goes through<br />many trials, but he too is redeemed when he becomes one of the last men standing.  And Sol ironically becomes the man in charge.<br />Sadly(spoiler alert) many brave souls are lost during the last episode, but the ones that are left most soldier on.  The true terrorist leader swears for a hundred years never to give up, and the he sacrifices himself rather than be captured.  Great Series, awesome characters, very good writing, great sets and backgrounds, absolutely the best show on TV.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was OK but not at all scandalous like reported in the news.  Just a regular romance novel set in todays  world with a little mystery added to keep it less slutty.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I usually like to read a novel slowly, savoring it, but it was impossible with this book. Once I grabbed it I could not put it down.
B009477BOI|5.0|I just watched this (2x) with my grandson and marveled at both how relevant it still is and how it has survived for 3 generations. It was as entertaining now as when I saw it in the movie theatres as a child. One BIG thi9ng here, however, is that none of the videos I shared with my own children were as sharp and distinct as this HD enhanced version. That, and a 50-inch flat screen sure makes it like the REAL deal at the theatres! I highly recommend it as a family flick, something for the little ones, or just to watch again and reminisce of the good old days when Dick Van Dyke was a young man doing quality films.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is cool. I fell like I am fighting with the force. The characters are fun to us. Awesome
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Glad to find out what happened next.  Still not so shocking, just like every other romance novel.  Good Characters and plot line.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Fantastic, intelligent, Real Music from truly Real Musicians!<br />The liner notes booklet is so beautiful and informative I may just have to get the large format vinyl LP version too.<br />Real Music for Real People.<br />Thanks!

B00F6HOW4M|5.0|Dear Amazon, I don't feel like I need to give an explanation of why I gave the album 5 stars. Listen to it and you'll understand.
B00EPC2ZOI|1.0|I tired to purchase one episode and it gave me another. I left feedback for amazon and was ignored. I usually have good things to say about amazon customer service but maybe at last they have abandoned it. I never heard anything back and was not given a refund. Because these mistakes are rare on amazon (for me) I tired again. this time i clicked on episode three, i made sure twice that there was no way I clicked another box... it gave me episode six!!! So if you like paying once for something you don't want and then once for the item you do want buy this from amazon. Otherwise I suggest Hulu. Sorry amazon but this instant video service is VERY DISAPPOINTING!<br />BTW I love this show.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My marriage of 24 years has broken down, despite love on both sides.  The issue that would have saved it I believe is if we understood the five languages.  As my wife has left determined not to return I do not know the future of us, but I do know that if their is the slightest chance I believe it will be by following the principles in the five languages.  Just hard to do when there is no proximity.

B007SGM084|5.0|I've been an avid reader of fictional novels for over thirty years yet never felt the need to publicly rate, review and/or defend a writer before now. I found many of the negative comments surrounding this series to be unfair to say the least. If you're looking for a book based on reality, I suggest you don't read fictional novels where any and everything is possible. Remembering myself at 21, I could vividly relate to the 21-year-old Anastasia. She is an ambitious, strong-willed, inexperienced virgin who rarely, if ever dated prior to meeting Christian Grey. Why would we be looking for her to be more comfortable or experienced during her first intimate experience-- with her first intimate partner? I LOVED her! I couldn't believe someone actually questioned Christian being a self-made billionaire at 26 while we live in the age of the real life Mark Zurkerberg (Facebook creator) who was a 23-year-old, Harvard dropout when he became a billionaire! As far as sexual experiences go, who really knows what goes on in the privacy of someone else's bedroom without being a personal witness? And please don't rely upon porn where the \\"actors\\" KNOW the cameras are watching! LOL!<br /><br />This trilogy requires the attention of the mature, open mind reader--especially if you have no prior knowledge or experience in interacting with people with backgrounds similar to those of Christian and Anastasia. In a nutshell, Christian is an super sexy, arrogant, self-absorbed billionaire who has become accustomed to getting any and everything he wants by whatever means necessary. Upon meeting the ordinary, average girl around the corner, Anastasia, he is immediately intrigued by her effects upon him and finally resolves himself into thinking he should simply add her to his list of sexual encounters without consequence in order to solve his \\"appetite.\\" However, Anastasia is a strong-willed, self-confident, level-headed young woman who knows exactly what she wants out of life and has a well-though out, fail-proof plan that she's ready to work in order to grab hold of her future. Let's just say, her stubborn will constantly keeps him on his toes as he tries to figure out why he can't just walk away and disregard her altogether. It's okay to skip past some of the BDSM (I did) but KEEP READING. The trilogy is so much more than about that! TWO THUMBS UP!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It was not an academy award winner but it was a super fun movie with a good twist on Zombies.  Great movie for the whole (but twisted) family.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Great looking graphics and photos. The data provided is sufficient for general use.(Could be more detailed) Will keep the weather channel app for alerts and warnings.
086547897X|5.0|The seller had a good communication, and honest. I got this even cheaper from the seller since he was being a honest person telling me there is a little minor problem on this book. So, he told me about it prior he was about to ship the book, and I was totally okay with it. When it was delivered, actually the book is just fine as good. The cut in the corner of book were not serious at all. It was not bothering me at all; I just simply taped it. So far, I am using this book just fine for my art studio class.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was such a great read. Christian's story is so tragic and beautiful. His journey to love and accepting he is loved is heart wrenching. Told from Ana's point of view she has great insight to her fifty shades.

B0070UFMOW|3.0|I won't chime in and add a further review on the sound quality of this piece. Enough has been said on the pros and cons of this DAC already for a potential buyer to form an educated decision. Instead, I will add my two cents regarding something that I wish had been mentioned before I bought this thing. That is, the quality of the Windows drivers offered for the E17.<br /><br />First and foremost, this does not apply if you plan on using this solely with your portable playback device. In this capacity, the E17 works flawlessly and performs exactly what is promised. However, should you decide to make use of this for a sound solution on your PC, be warned that the drivers Fiio offers for this device are... very poor. At best.<br /><br />Most frustrating of all is the random issues these drivers have while using the DAC, resulting in a regular occurrence of a BSOD due to 'USB_BUGCODE_DRIVER'. I was immediately suspicious of the E17's drivers being the culprit here, as I had never encountered this error before and they began literally the same day I began using this device with my PC.<br /><br />Over the months, I have experimented with things a bit more. First, I tried using the E17 for a day, then my old sound solution, and back to the E17 again. Only during the E17 days did I encounter this BSOD. Not necessarily conclusive, so during vacation, I decided to go a bit more extreme and format the machine entirely.<br /><br />For the first 72 hours, I did not install the E17 drivers or attempt to use the device. Perfect running under heavy use. Then I formatted again, this time installing the E17 drivers from the get-go and not installing the drivers for my previous solution. This, I thought, would confirm that there was no conflict at blame here. Disappointingly, the BSOD crashes began within the hour and continued throughout the E17's 72-hour test window.<br /><br />Even when it doesn't torpedo your OS, the E17 is known to go on the fritz without warning, leading eitherto a great deal of static in the background of your sound or an outright onslaught of hard noise. This last one is extremely unpleasant to encounter when you have headphones on, as 'onslaught of hard noise' is putting in politely in such close quarters.<br /><br />Fortunately, there are some tricks you can do to lessen the chance of these sound fritzes hitting you at all, although I would argue that it shouldn't be our responsibility to perform any sort of trick to encourage reliable performance out of any equipment. If it had just been released, then sure some bugs are to be expected. After so long and so many complaints both here and to Fiio's own website, faulty drivers are just completely unacceptable and they seem to have no intention of ever issuing an updated set of drivers to address these issues.<br /><br />At the end of the day, all I can say is that you are in luck if you only wish to use this as an amp for your portable device. If you are looking for something to also serve as a PC solution in the bargain, I strongly advise that you look elsewhere until Fiio is willing to step forward and handle their problems.
B00CFSWMYM|4.0|I think this is really good. It is mind boggling how much negativity comes out when a band changes their sound. Yes, it is different from \\"Feel it Break.\\" Does that instantly make it bad? No! Artists need to experiment with their sound. Do you just want them to make the same album over and over again? Of course not, silly. I'll admit, it's not quite as good as \\"Feel it Break,\\" but I think Austra is still one of the most unique and under-appreciated artists today, and this album doesn't change that. It's really not _that_ drastically different anyway.<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"Forgive Me,\\" \\"Painful Like,\\" and \\"Home.\\" I could totally get funky to these songs.

0743496736|3.0|I get that my book is Christian, I'm a Christian and her book would be different. As much as I do not like curse words, I do not expect most books to have them nowadays. i also don't expect a huge message of hope. However, there NEEDS to be some hope in the story. The ending was terrible for the shooter and his parents! Also, one of the flashbacks had continuity issues. I am no one to judge, as it is easy to make the same mistake. I think Jodi's writing is excellent, but I really hated  the ending. I would hate to think people decide the choice made in the ending is a good choice that would make things better for that person. I am all for being realistic, but there should be some happiness or hope. I like books with deep meaning, but not like this.  I don't think a school shooter should ride off happily ever after into the sunset, but his ending should at least be happier than this. He should get some shot at redemption and some realization he is, in fact, loved. If you want to write a book showing the shooter is loved by someone too, then have him realize that, Have him feel both the sting of what he did and hope for the future.

A lot to learn, not all need to be taken to the heart since this book is very intensive and in depth.<br />The other side of this very serious book is the fact that its exhausting to read through, sometimes.<br /><br />Still, a mandatory on any serious developer book shelf.

B00F5F9WF4|5.0|Drake's music has always been the soundtrack to my life.  Every album is marks a specific time in my life. Take Care gives me a sense of nostalgia and brings me back to the place I was during that time. Rich in memories and the feelings of those moments. Nothing Was the Same marks my growth as a person and I look forward to making the new memories that correlate with this classic album.

B003XYERRM|5.0|The author made you feel as if you were there and the characters were real.  It made Richard III someone other than the evil uncle who slew his nephews to gain the throne.  The love story between Edward and Elizabeth and Richard and Ann Neville was beautifully portrayed.  Ms. Penman made a good case for Richard III not being the person who was responsible for the deaths of Edward's sons.
B00D2CYU2W|2.0|I did not like it, I felt bad for my idol Matt Damon, who I suppose played his role very well, but so many changes from his usual acting,films, and looks were changed, it turned me off. Michael Douglas has never been a favorite of mine. It won many awards, and I cannot agree, I did not like it,not at all.

B009OA57MI|5.0|I'm  happy with this game. I use a 100 dollar after-market internet tablet with 1.2 gig processer and the game runs flawlessly. I really enjoy military flight simulaters and this game is good and realistic. Some things I've noticed is there is no dog fighting, you only have two missiles to choose from, no flir targeting systems, and you have to have the target on your HUD display to be able to lock on and fire. But that is no problem for me. I like using my tablet as the joy stick and it works great. Good practice if you like taking of from base, staging an aerial invasion and returning to your aircraft carrier for landing.

B008N1LL42|2.0|I know this review is going to get hounded, but if it saves even one person from losing 2 hours of their precious existence that they'll never get back, then I can still walk this Earth with dignity.<br />It really is that bad, and I have a high threshold for pain when it comes to bad movies.  I love science fiction and fantasy pieces, so my ability to suspend reality and enjoy: a less than average, low-budget, lone-hero saves the galaxy, all medieval maidens are beautiful, barbarians with 80's hairstyles cinematic turds is highly developed.  Take some Immodium and pinch this one off as fast as you can if you find yourself unable to pass it up.<br />The acting is so forced and that's simply unforgivable for the likes of Neeson and Skaarsgard.  They have both been in great projects that were the kryptonite to this one.<br />The special effects are one of two redeeming qualities, and I suspect this is where the majority of the budget was thrown.<br />The story and character development was rushed even with an extra half-hour of filming (compared to standard 90 minute film). And then some scenes (e.g. the soccer game) were painfully overextended making you wonder what was so important about it, other than face-time for particular actors and actresses (Rihanna operating Fire Control).<br />The other redeeming quality is that this movie definitely pays homage to our veterans who served in Pearl Harbor and does it well.  I refuse to post spoilers for those of you who are not convinced to give this film a 'wide berth' based on such a fanatical review.  Hell, I usually avoid reviews like this one and am still tempted to take it down.  It really is a train wreck ladies and gentlemen.  Probably makes a great gag gift for the company party though.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|The story starts with Alex getting kidnapped and locked in a small crate. The man doesn't say much beyond the fact that he wants to watch her die. At the same time, Camille Verhoeven has been given this case. It is hard for him since it is so close to what happened with his own wife. Camille is in a race against time to save Alex, a girl he knows nothing about. But things take a strange twist and Camille is on board unwillingly to find Alex and figure out what is really going on.<br /><br />It is so hard to review this book without giving away too many details. You have to discover them along the way. I have a love and hate relationship with Alex. You feel sorry for her, hate her actions, and then want to cry. Camille is very wrapped up in his own past and seems distracted with this case, but he does keep working to find out what really happened to Alex.<br /><br />This is a great story! There are great twists and turns, wonderful characters, and a horrifying ending. Be warned, the ending is a bit graphic, it works well for the book but it wraps everything up nicely.<br /><br />This is one book that you don't want to miss. Now I want to read the other books.
B00DXP7L88|3.0|I fell in love with \\"Dexter\\" TV series when I started watching Season 6. I loved what Dexter (Michael C. Hall) does which is killing serial killers, pedophiles, and other creeps. I also loved that he finally met Hannah (Yvonne Stravhowksi), a woman who accepted him for who he is. The reason is that she was murderous herself. Although she was a despicable person in Season 7, she later changed and became a better girlfriend and mother to Dexter and Harrison in the final season. Season 8 is boring at first. But, it becomes more interesting, intense, and even tragic in the series finale.<br /><br />I did not like what happened at the end of this show. But, I understand why it happened the way it did. Dexter felt guilty and thought that he deserves to be totally alone and withdrawn from the people (Saxon's mother and Deb (both dead)and Hannah and Harrison (both alive) he loves.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|I only really watched it for Henry Cavill so unless you're a big fan of his you may not like it.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Acting, story, and, graphics are  done well. Even though it is obviously  imagination  there is enough of a story to keep you in the moment.<br />It's not for casual watching, but well worth your time. Watch the trailer first.
B000JIN3J8|5.0|I have this on DVD and it is the best.  I watch it two or three times a year... I will watch it again in a month or two.  It follows the book perfectly.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Rothfuss is a superb writer and seems to be able to paint emotions and scenes from his words perfectly in your head. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody interested. He is up the with George rr Martin, and the others like Sanderson.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Very pleased with story line twist. Didn't see it coming. Well made. I would put this one on the &#34;watch again&#34; list. I'm sure there are scenes that I missed during the action.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|It's okay but not refined enough for that period of time in England.  I've no doubt they thought this way but I think &#34;Emma&#34; was too bouncy.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Gritty, crazy, fun, intense, witty, and just what a comic movie should be. Karl Urban makes watching Dredd worth the time.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|I would give this 5 stars, but it was really similar to the first one.  Although, I did like the jokes more, I couldn't help but think the creators fell back on the same plot that created the first hit.
B006PIXKVW|2.0|Watched most of it.  I skipped to the end.  Maybe sometime in the future I will watch it all but for me it wasn't that good.
B00633W614|5.0|I really enjoyed this book cannot wait to read the last book in this series. Looking forward to reading more of Jeffery Archer books in the future.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|[[ASIN:B009YP9L7U Waking Up Married (Harlequin KISS)]] What a concept to start a book.  I laughed my head off throughout when the male lead was not behaving like a sociopath.  His behavior was the only part that worried me a bit.  Perhaps that is what gives this book its mystery right to the end!  Thanks for keeping it tasteful.
B00FFV9VAO|5.0|I love this show and look forward to it whenever it comes on! I can honestly say every episode makes me laugh, usyally many times throughout it!!

B00EAH3GHI|5.0|Finally in its entirety, the amazing Live and Loud set for MTV officially released.  The added rehearsal footage plus the television performances are a sweet bonus, but the show itself is the juice:  show opener 'Radio Friendly Unit Shifter' whacks out of the screen and speakers forcefully, and the set list mixes all the eras.  Great renditions of 'Drain You', 'All Apologies', 'Come As You Are', Bowie's 'The Man Who Sold The World', 'Rape Me', 'Heart Shaped Box' and 'School'.  This DVD is a must have for fans of Nirvana.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I loved this book - not a happy story, but a real, 'authentic' story. Each character see,ed vile at some point, but almost all were forgivable (Shirley excepted).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An excellent book. Yes, erotic, yes, kinky, but unexpectedly profound. I'd highly suggest the book for any of several reasons but for whatever reason you read, you will surely be satisfied.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It is a very nice book, I read the English version which just like the other books in the trilogy I found some odd English constructions... I would have to re-read it again in Swedish to enjoy it even more.<br /><br />Nice and convoluted story, the characters are likeable and with some degree of enjoyable depth.

Well done, Emma Chase. I'm bossing everyone into this! Including JJ. I made her drop her current book and RUN to the Kindle Store. Uh...that doesn't sound like much of a run, but I'm sure at the very least she One-Clicked very speedily. I LOVED that this was written by the male's POV.

B003VANOFY|5.0|This is hands down the nicest headset I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. I've been gaming since BBS's. The ability to finally have team speak at the touch of a button is great. There are folks out there that say that you can't use it with TS, but you can provided you have a programmable mouse. I program the headset to the mouse &#34;forward/reverse&#34; and then TS is set to PTT on mouse button 5. Done, works like a charm. Sound quality blew me away. I'm playing Arma III at the moment, and it is so nice to know where shots are coming from, hear people moving in the grass and know exactly where they're at, just by sound. I was amazed at the sound quality. As I said, best I've ever had. Well worth the money. I just want to see how long the batteries last. Keep in mind with this headset, unlike many others, you CAN replace the battery. Look it up on you tube. That was a major plus to me as the last set I had only lasted 6 months, and you could not replace the battery. I should have just spent the extra money then and gotten these. Either way, you can't go wrong here.

B0093X805W|5.0|The last time I experienced Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in book form was about eight years after its publication, in 1972 or 1973: As best I can recall, my third-grade teacher read the story out loud to our class, but at that time I didn't appreciate Roald Dahl's amazing ability to tell a fun story.  I downloaded the Kindle edition a few weeks ago to use as background material for a short story I wrote, and the book instantly grabbed me and pulled me in.  It didn't take me long to finish it, a reflection of not only the low page count but Dahl's writing as well.  It was like romping through a literary amusement park, and I'm sure I wore a smile the whole time I read it.  Thanks to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I rediscovered what good fun writing is all about, and will strive to reflect this sense of joy in my own writing.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is so versatile, I love it. I even have it as an app on my Google chrome and on my HTC phone. That way everything is synced. I love using the web clipper on my Google chrome too for evernote. I also use Catch notes. Would like evernote better if they would do their note selections horizontal rather than vertical. It just feels odd sliding it side ways on my kindle. As there isn't really enough room to see them right. Other than that it's great. My wish, if evernote could look more like catch notes, and they would all sync together. But I love all my note apps, and I'm happy. I also use skitch with it. All their apps are great to use together, or by themselves. I love the colors of their apps too, that is a main reason I chose them. Not like ones that are blue or other boring colors. Or that have tiny fonts you can't read. I would like to change to different fonts in evernote. Maybe some day they'll let you do that.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|only bought these books because was told how great they were. Unfortunately they are not the genre I enjoy. So I did not finish them.
B000FA675C|5.0|Once again Dan Brown amazes me with his work. He sends Professor Langdon and the reader, on a mysterious yet controversial journey.  I promise you that the plot and story line will keep your eyes glued to this book. In the story he explores the deepest secrets of the Catholic church, and at the same time, exploits the secrets of many secret societies. He incorporates a plethora of information in to this long book, but makes it read extremely fast. I was a 6th grader when I first read this book and I was still able to comprehend it. This is a very easy read for anyone in the family.<br /><br /> I will say though that much of the information in the book is fictional. Especially the characters. I have talked to many people that have also read it and the believed that the whole story was true. He even puts at the beginning of the book that the information is fictional! In conclusion, it is a very easy read for anyone but when reading it don't take much of the information as true.

0307352153|5.0|There are plenty of other reviews out there (I think this is review #1540 on Amazon) that should be enough to convince you to read \\"Quiet.\\"<br /><br />If you have found this review and if you are contemplating the investment of reading time, don't hesitate any longer.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" is thought-provoking and rich. I hope it  promotes a shift back from our current culture of personality to a culture of character.  I know it's doubtful, but one can hope. The media infatuation with personality seems like a deep love affair. In some ways, the media are the personalities who in turn grab attention and enter the great maw of celebrity worship.  A vicious cycle.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" encourages us, from schools to the workplace to our everyday interactions, to reconsider our thinking about introverts. Essentially, it's an argument that the world would be a better place if we celebrated all aspects of humanity and understood that we need all types of brainpower and all types of character traits in order to move ahead. \\"Quiet\\" is one of those non-fiction reads that provides a new prism in which to view the world and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />This review is being posted to suggest another audience for \\"Quiet:\\" fiction writers.<br /><br />If you read \\"Quiet\\" and if you write fiction, you might never think about any characters you develop without thinking about where and how they fall within the world of introverts, extroverts and ambiverts (individuals who don't lean one way or the other).<br /><br />From Susan Cain's \\"Note on the Words Introvert and Extrovert\\" from the end of \\"Quiet.\\"<br /><br />The book \\"focuses on the person who recognizes him- or herself somewhere in the following constellation of attributes: reflective, cerebral, bookish, unassuming, sensitive, thoughtful, serious, contemplative, subtle, introspective, inner-directed, gentle, calm, modest, solitude-seeking, shy, risk-averse, thin-skinned. Quiet is also about this person's opposite number: the `man of action' who is ebullient, expansive, sociable, gregarious, excitable, dominant, assertive, active, risk-taking, thick-skinned, outer-directed, lighthearted, bold, and comfortable in the spotlight.\\"<br /><br />Cain uses \\"introvert\\" and \\"extrovert\\" in broad terms but I'm recommending this book to any writer who is trying to think through a character under development--where does your antagonist or protagonist or other minor character fall within the options available?  \\"Quiet\\" is a handbook, based on science and lots of research, about personality types and how they function.<br /><br />And, as with a lot of great fictional characters, it comes down to the inner life versus the outer life.  A solid contrast between the two always makes for a juicy character.  \\"Whoever you are,\\" Cain writes, \\"bear in mind that appearance is not reality. Some people act like extroverts, but the efforts costs them in energy, authenticity, and even physical health. Others seem aloof or self-contained, but their inner landscapes are rich and full of drama. So the next time you see a person with a composed face and a soft voice, remember that inside her mind she mind be solving an equation, composing a sonnet, designing a hat.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|I really liked this book because it really made me think about time and how I spend my prescious allotment.  It got a little weird 3/4 of the way through which cheapened the reading experience for me but it redeemed itself by the end.  I worthwile read.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The ads appear between games, so relatively unobtrusive. Nothing mind-blowing, but a decent spider app. And, hey, the price is right.
055358202X|4.0|A Feast for Crows is he fourth book in George R. R. Martin's series of novels that the HBO television series Game of Thrones is base on. Though this is not a genre I typically read, I was a huge fan of the last book, A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />This installment was a bit slower. If it had been my first introduction to these characters, I might have been bored - but since I already love them, I was willing to follow them on long voyages across the sea, through the woods, and down icy mountainsides. If I had one complaint, it would be that there were so many Cersei chapters. While none of Martin's characters are wholly good or wholly bad, Cersei remains wholly unlikeable.<br /><br />What I realized in this book is that Martin is a feminist. All his female characters are powerful women confronting a society that isn't ready for them to be leaders. The women are all challenging traditional gender roles- some are learning to swordfight like knights and others are trying to change the laws of inheritance so they can rule kingdoms on their own.<br /><br />The next book, A Dance with Dragons, will be available in October. If you can't wait, it's already available on Kindle.<br /><br />-Katie O'Rourke, author of Monsoon Season

B000PEX1IE|4.0|A number of well-known comics of the day, provide an amusing adventure with Ghosts in NYC. Only when the credits ran at the end, did I know that the quite attractive young woman who played a secondary role was Sigourney Weaver. A somewhat larger role and she might well have been the only reason needed to see the movie. The Bill Murray role has more than enough adolescent humor to it, but,  on the whole, the cast did a good job in treating the extermination of ghosts with the proper disrespect. There are not many outright laughs but the atmosphere is an appropriately light one. I am not one, but I assume that fans of one or more of these popular comic/actors will enjoy being able to see these guys as they were  when coming up.
B00F2LIV4E|2.0|DT is probably my favorite band, so it makes me sad to say that they've only gone downhill since Portnoy left, imo. Dramatic Turn of Events has some good tracks, but there are only 2 tracks on this new album that I might want to play again. For reference, Images and Words is one of my all-time favorite albums from any artist.
0399165274|4.0|Forsyth has another winner with Kill List. While the story is a thriller with a standard supersecret, US clandestine organization hunting  an Islamic terrorist inciting random acts of small, but extreme violence, the draw of the tale is the excellent attention to the details of espionage tradecraft that both sides employ. The plot surrounds the hunt for an Osama bin Laden type terrorist who is inspiring random acts of violence worldwide through his online web videos. Both the cyberworld as well as the more traditional, almost mundane deep cover agents are employed. Forsyth spends lots of time detailing the various creative exploits to hunt down and eliminate the terrorists. Throughout, an air of believe-ability is maintained. For lovers of this particular genre and especially the tradecraft details, this is a quick and pleasurable read.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|Well, I usually don´t write reviews, however I feel the need to do so for this amazing game.<br /><br />This game is perfect, it has everything an RPG fan would need, and I also believe it would be enjoyable for any gamer.<br /><br />PROs:<br />- AMAZING story, you will be completely absorbed by it, one of the best stories every.<br />- Great concept of living each day from April to March, makes you plan ahead how to spend your time each day !!<br />- Beautiful characters, you get to care about them in a very serious way!<br />- Marvelous combat system, while it may seem simple at times, it's very fun and addictive, All'out attacks, physical attacks, magic, buffs, and creating strategy surrounding the roles of your characters is simply amazing.<br />- Extremely creative dungeons that will remind you of your childhood !!

B005AKFXZW|2.0|The imagery in The Night Circus is quite profoundly beautiful, as is the attempt at a transcendent love story. Unfortunately that love story is nothing more than an attempt. Morgenstern has managed to create a fairly atmospheric world filled with wonder and beauty but I feel that stylistically the novel would have had a bigger impact had the magic merely been implied and taken for granted, as in magical realism, instead of simply being stated fact. It could be a personal issue but I believe that by stating the fact that the characters are magical takes away some of the mystery. This might not have been a problem had Morgenstern created a world in which magic was commonplace but, because of the realistic setting, it just comes off as a poor reason to create images which scale the impossible.<br /><br />The characters are not particularly interesting and there is no style to their crafting whatsoever. There are flickers of interest as the exposition of each new character hints at great depth but then it comes to nothing. The dialogue is frequently hollow, insipid and frustrating and only heightens just how boring the characters really are.<br /><br />Morgenstern has a keen eye for beauty, as is evident in the gorgeous imagery within the novel, but unfortunately she can be incredibly clunky as well. Instead of tearing apart some of the awkward metaphors and painful dialogue I'd prefer to say that whoever edited the novel did a really poor job. Some passages ooze a sense of wonder and mystique while others simply ooze. The narrative is poorly managed and, as with the characters, just plain old dull.<br /><br />This review is largely negative but I did enjoy the novel, not a great deal to be fair but there was a little enjoyment. I liked it because of the imagery, characters that were nearly interesting and the sniff of a great storyline that just never came to fruition.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|I may be slightly biased towards the sound of the cello in general, but I honestly feel that this group would be better termed &#34;The Cello Guys&#34;.  Their pure-cello tribute to Berlin (which makes cellos create sounds in a way that I was unaware cellos actually could) was certainly the most powerful piece in the set, followed by the again pure-cello &#34;Nearer My God to Thee&#34;, and even the piano-centric pieces would be nowhere near as strong without the cello support.  There were no pieces that I disliked, however, and the piano work is also quite good.

0425263991|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite books by Nalini Singh. I couldn't wait for this one to come out. It's one of very few books that I put everything else I was reading down for. I started it immediately and read through it quickly and am even more in love with the series than I was before.<br /><br />I think we as readers have been waiting for a psy/psy matchup from Nalini Singh. And not only did she give it to us, she gave it to us in such a way that we couldn't have even imagined how amazing it would be.<br /><br />If you've never entered Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling world, I highly suggest you give it a try. After her first book Slave to Passion I was completely sucked in. Yes they're romance novels, but she gives you so much back story that happens along side these romances that you want it for the love story as much as you want it to know what's going to happen next in the Psy/Changeling world. And after all the changes in this book I cannot wait until she delivers another one to us next summer.

1451695195|5.0|The author teaches brain surgery at Harvard, but speaks with such a simple and loving humility. I thought he would be explaining more technical, scientific information and that he would use a lot of logic and argument, since the title is about \\"Proof.\\" The thing is, his story is simply unbelievable from a scientific view. The things that happened to him are \\"impossible,\\" logically or technically. So, he doesn't have to go into a lot of fancy mental gymnastics. His story can only be explained by the fact that God and the spiritual world do exist and impact our lives. He tells his story in a simple and personal way that's easy to read, very engaging and touching.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just love this series. The script is so well written - we love the wit and humor. Really have to pay attention to the dialog for some of the witty comments. Amazon Video on-demand makes the viewing of this series so convenient. Prime membership is awesome!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Four-star novel, in my estimation. I was fortunate to have the time to sit down and read it straight through, virtually uninterrupted, and when I had to put it down for a bit (to eat, or do security checks) I jumped right back in without hesitation. The story really carries you along.<br /><br />The connections to The Shining (other than the obvious, like the shared protagonist) become more apparent as the story moves on. It was easy to look at it as a standalone novel in the beginning, but not so much later on. This is neither a good or bad thing, simply an observation. Some King fans will really squee at two of the main connections. I did at one of them...it seemed a masterstroke. The other didn't floor me, but I had no issues, otherwise.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the True Knot, while interesting as characters, never seemed to really stand a chance against Danny and Abra. They had to pull off some pretty interesting tricks in order to win, but I never once got the sense that anyone was seriously screwed. This is not something I'm used to from King.<br /><br />Also, for fans of Joe Hill, there's a pretty sweet NOS4A2 easter egg in the first few chapters that I thought was really frickin' cool.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|It's Alan Jackson, so you knew it had to be good, but this is GREAT!  Every single song just draws you in, and the pickin' and playing is so well done.  I'm in love with this album.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I love this app because everything is free and it really works well.  It makes me feel like an actual DJ and that's really cool.  I would recommend this app for anyone and everyone that loves music and making music their own.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As a long time (since the '70s!) King fan, i relish each newly released book of his; sometimes the books are disappointing but most often they keep me spellbound and on the edge of my seat just terrified at what (who?) may be waiting on the next page. And as someone who has a shining herself, I often find Stephen's knowledge and characters' use of these gifts/curses fascinating. I won't bother to go into the synopsis; my whole review can be summed up by saying, &#34;Oh, what a lovely, horrifyingly satisfying way to tell the tale of little Danny all grown up!&#34;
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Very entertaining for kids and adults alike! Although there is no language, the humor and message is understood internationally. Well done!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very accurate, and love the satellite :) I also like the 10 day forecast. I also like the new update, very user friendly, and can add locations easily.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Very exciting book! The Author keeps you guessing  there are lots of twist and turns in the story. Definitely worth reading.
0738737909|5.0|These are absolutely beautiful. The artwork is stunning. I was a little worried about tears or damage as I read some previous reviews, and while some of my cards were stuck together, there wasn't any damage or peeling from the cards. The cards feel of great quality, feel good in the hand, and the book gives great meanings to the cards as well as spreads. The deck and book also comes in a beautiful box to keep them in. I'm so pleased with my purchase and find the artwork so gorgeous that I plan to not only buy the Tarot Illuminati silk bag, but the Tarot Illuminati journal as well! Highly recommend!<br /><br />Edit (Sept 29, 2013)Some of the cards have started peeling in the corners so I will request a new deck from Amazon. I do want these cards.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is not a children's story, and Dicken's political leanings will surprise you. The novel is beautifully written and morally up-to-date. Stop reading me and go read it!

B0038P59A0|5.0|I really enjoy RDJr and his acting acumen. He never fails, and Guy Ritchie directing is awesome also.<br /><br />Writing in-depth reviews are not worth while and could backfire for Amazon.

B00AWJYJVA|4.0|Le carre is as good as ever. Why is it that the good guys always end on the losing side
B005544TRQ|5.0|minimal attention to political correctness (aside from the mandatory black woman in charge), very few ideological rants, just good entertainment.
B001DJLCRC|2.0|This was not as good as everyone told me it was. It took an entire season to get interesting. Not sure I will even watch anymore of it. Maybe on TV, won't buy it.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Smarty, witty, and funny. It doesn't take more than a couple episodes to get into the show. Great re watch ability
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|I expected this to be much better. The previews showed the best parts of the entire show. DiCaprio has done better.
B000JCQCW4|4.0|It's a good movie about addiction and how it destroys peoples lives. Not your typical popcorn and coke movie.<br /><br />From a techincal stand point, it's brilliantly edited and shot.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I could not stop playing.The game set up is great as well as the story. I love customizing my characters.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|In Utero is by far my favorite Nirvana album. I think Steve Albini did a wonderful job of capturing what the band actually sounded like at their peak. Something Andy Wallace's mix of Nevermind failed to do. In this version of the record I get to hear a full scope picture of what led to the album that i enjoyed so  much the first time I heard it in 1993.<br /><br />The remasters disc is my least favorite part of this. I like the original master because it had dynamics. Something that's lost in this remaster. However, it doesn't ruin the record. It's also nice to have the B-sides right there. Hearing Scott Litt's polished re-mix of Pennyroyal Tea is interesting, but I prefer the original mix still. I'm happy to finally hear Albini's mixes of Heart-Shaped Box and All Apologies. Though they sound exactly as I imagined.<br /><br />The remix disc is very intriguing. Albini did the remix himself. So it's not some other producer trying to &#34;improve&#34; upon the original. In this disc he makes some interesting choices. In, &#34;Serve the Servants&#34; he uses an alternate solo which I frankly like better. It stands out from the mix better than the original, and is classic Kurt. For, &#34;Dumb,&#34; he actually dumps the cello. Which I prefer, but he makes up for it by bringing the vocals up. It's quite fun to sit there and try to pick out the differences. It reminds me of the 20th version of Nevermind where you try and sense the differences in Butch Vig's mix of the songs from Wallace's.The demo's on this disc. are fun to hear. Mostly instrumental, so you get the the impression that the melodies and lyrics hadn't been finalized if written at all yet. You also get the demo of what I affectionately call the first Foo Fighters song Marigold.<br /><br />Here is the part that I paid extra for. Getting the Live and Loud performance on both Audio CD and DVD. Now this performance was a big deal to me when I was 16. I had missed Nirvana's 1992 in studio performance at MTV. I onl;y saw the bits that were played after the fact. So Live and Loud was big to me when it happened. And it was great. However, when I saw that there was an audio version I was worried. I HATE live recordings. HATE! Let me clarify. I don't hate live performances. They're great when you'e there. But live recordings tend to Suck with a capital S! This one is very good. I mean VERY Good. It really captures the performance beautifully. The DVD is the performance in all it''s glory. And in it you get all the performances that didn't make it on to TV as well as rehearsals and bonus live content.<br /><br />I highly recommend this version of In Utero's 20th anniversary to anyone who counts themselves as a Nirvana fan. Well worth the money.y saw the bits that were played after the fact. So Live and Loud was big to me when it happened. And it was great.

B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Stilted dialogue and one-dimensional characters made it a boring read. Feels like an author who will mature - but only under the tutelage of a good editor.
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|This is a very weak effort-perhaps a poor translation?  If this had been the first book of his that I read, I would never have even considered reading any others.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This tool stays with me most of the time here on the farm, when your on the back 40 with a dull knife is like using a chainsaw without a file.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|I find that it was a bit cooler than the Stallone version of Judge Dredd. I like a good &#34;shoot 'em up&#34; movie from time to time. Not the best story, and it was hard to suspend disbelief at times, but overall, It was decent.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I was intrigued by the story in The Dragon Tattoo.  Knew I had to read it, gotta find the second entry yet.  Truly excellent storytelling.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I liked that this movie started out fast with the action and then kept piling it on. It had some pretty awesome action scenes and I felt suspense as I watched, which is always good. The most unbelievable part of the plot was that Brad Pitt worked for the United Nations, and it was the U.N. that actually accomplished something. More unbelievable than Zombies.
B00992CF6W|3.0|The game is great and all but it would be better with red stone.<br />And positions and spawn blocks and Herobrine and rivines<br />So I hope you are reading this Mojang so please update it to<br />Have all this stuff and the Nether and the End.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I like it and I highly recommend it. A lot of action and funny in so how. I would not regret about it.

B00F35BV64|3.0|As a life-long Star Trek fan, I was disappointed in this movie.  It was a quality production of course, but the plot didn't have the expected depth of a Star Trek movie.
1476715904|5.0|WOW<br /><br />WOW<br /><br />WOW<br /><br />I have two words to describe this book:<br /><br />Heartfelt<br /><br /> and<br /><br />Heartbreaking<br /><br />I love reading novels and I love poetry so if you put the two together you end up with a book as amazing as Slammed. Yes - I cried while reading this - a lot, because it felt so REAL going through it and it was beautifully done. One thing's for sure - this book will make you feel and tugs at the heartstrings. It's not just some run-of-the-mill high-school romance that you find, no, it runs deeper than that - this novel is about LIFE.<br /><br />Actually for the last probably half of the novel I was crying my eyes out.<br /><br />And rightly so.<br /><br />  \\"What you're feeling now, and the person you may reach with your poetry five years from now - that's why you write poetry\\"<br /><br />Starting of with Layken moving to a new town, she immediately comes across Will - the poetry-loving cute guy who lives right across the street. There was the insta-love element at play here, BUT the other elements of the story made this a non-issue by far. Because it was so touching and amazing, it flows on smoothly - with of course those complications that are bound to occur. The characters were well developed and interesting, where their features didn't just run skin-deep, you could tell that a lot of thought had gone into creating them.<br /><br />I really don't have the capacity to say anything else at this point, as my mind is still reeling from everything that's happened. All you really need to know is that this book is amazing and you should read it!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I watched the movie on my Roku and the quality of the video is very good. The movie itself is excellent. I love it.
1250007208|4.0|This is not your ordinary Cinderella story<br /><br />\\"Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time.\\"<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg and popular mechanic in the city of New Beijing. Detested by her step-mother and two step-sisters , they are all too eager to volunteer her as a test subject to find the cure for the plague beginning to take over the city. If this isn't enough to deal with; the handsome Prince Kai is thrown into the mix, and the two begin to form a bond; but at what cost? As secrets begin to unfold about Cinder's true identity and plans that threaten the lives of everyone in the New Commonweatlh, difficult decisions need to be made.<br /><br />\\"Vanity is a factor, but it is more a question of control. It is easier to trick others into perceiving you as beautiful if you can convince yourself you are beautiful. But mirrors have an uncanny way of telling the truth.\\"<br /><br />Cinder was a novel that I wasn't entirely sure I would enjoy. I mean, there are heaps of fairytale re-tellings out there. After seeing so many glowing reviews I must say that my expectations were set quite high, and were not left unsatisfied. In fact, THIS Cinderella story might even be better than the original. One thing I loved in particular was Marissa Meyer's writing style - everything was so descriptive and read really well. She was able to make even something as simple as walking into a laboratory seem interesting. This quality definitely made the book a joy to read, and it was clear that this is a quality piece of work.<br /><br />Although some aspects of the plot may have seemed predictable, I was surprised and relieved to find that some of my prior assumptions were proved wrong (and I have to add here that I'm sure there WILL be a plot-twist or two that you will not see coming) The sheer originality of this novel also made it really appealing. I would never have guessed that something like this would appeal to me - but it did thanks to it un-cliched concept (even though it is sort of based on a cliched classic story) and well developed characters. Especially in the genre of YA dystopian themed novels, a book has to really stand out to be successful - and this one does exactly that.<br /><br />*CONCLUSION*<br /><br />In conclusion, I would definitely recommend Cinder to anybody with a thirst for a dystopian novel that is original and plays on a well-known fairytale. I am definitely looking forward to reading the next book Scarlet, in the hopes that it will answer some significant questions and leave me just as satisfied.n though it is sort of based on a cliched classic story) and well developed characters.

0525478817|5.0|I really liked this book, and when I finally turned the last page (tear-stained face and all) I didn't really know how I would put the way I felt about it into words - but I'm going to try...<br /><br />I'm not usually the type of person who enjoys reading books about cancer, especially after My Sister's Keeper, which I did not particularly enjoy. On the other hand, this story can resonate with the likes of A Walk to Remember, which I loved. Both share various similarities; in the same way that Jamie is afraid to love Landon because of her illness, Hazel does not want to be a 'grenade' to the people around her and when she dies aims to hurt the least amount of people possible. But when faced with someone as witty and charming as Augustus Waters, how could she not?<br /><br />This story is many things, among them poetic, humourous, sad, ironic and philosophical. The writing was touching, beautiful and definitely allows the reader to form a strong connection with the story. The quotes from An Imperial Affliction fit in perfectly with what was happening and really added the depth that the events deserved. That aside, there were times when one could perhaps smile at the cute sentences exchanged by a young couple falling in love, there were times to cry, to understand and to give sympathy to the characters going through the harder days, even when that is something that a person with a terminal illness would hate you for. Ultimately, the book reiterates that the side effects of cancer may not really be that at all, and in fact cancer is a side effect of dying and not the other way around.<br /><br />As the words in print were thoughtfully written, so as the characters were thoughtfully created. To begin, Hazel Grace (or 'Just Hazel') is living with stage IV thyroid cancer, along with a problem with her lungs so that she always needs access to an oxygen tank to breathe properly. She is going along with life quite fine, claims she is not depressed but eventually is forced by her mother to attend a cancer support group at the local church, where she meets Gus. Of course there are other characters to mention which you will learn more about if you read the book, such as Hazel's other friend Isaac, the social worker Peter and the author of the book she loves so dearly; Peter Van Houten.<br /><br />During the course of the novel we learn more of these people, their strengths, struggles and journeys through lives that are far from perfect and certain to end. They refuse to be defined by their illnesses, even if that is how they are seen to the outside world. Oblivion may be something to be feared but it is an inevitable fate that they know they will face one day.<br /><br />The message to take however is that life goes on, and there are choices to be made that continue to define who we are and what lies ahead in the vast expanse of our lives.<br /><br />\\"Some infinities are bigger than other infinities\\"y her mother to attend a cancer support group at the local church, where she meets Gus.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Brad Pitt is getting older and I feel like they should have a younger fresher face for this role.<br /><br />Plus the movie had absolutely zero to do with the book.
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|There are some interesting insights, but some of this was common sense.  Overall, I would recommend reading this book only if you borrowed it from the library and were to scan major parts of the book.  It was really repetitive and extremely dry to try and read cover to cover.

B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I thought this was a beautifully written book. Even though I have never been to Atlanta or France I was transported there by the beautifully descriptive writing. The book was full of love, family dynamics and suspense. I didn't want it to end. I fell in love with the good characters and cannot wait to see what happens next in &#34;Murder a la Carte&#34;.

B00ESLTEOU|5.0|I last read a Jane Austen book almost 40 years ago, as a teenage boy in high school English class. I think it was Pride and Prejudice. At that time, it was a bit of a chore to read her book, and I struggled with the lack of action. I picked up Persuasion because my daughter is reading it in her own high school English class. This time around, it has been an absolutely brilliant read. Austen's character development, sharp insights, perceptions of social striving and the role of women, and description of interpersonal dynamics made for a great read that speaks to modern day social dynamics and social striving. And while some of her language and sentence structure is a bit of a hard go, I came to truly appreciate her mastery of the English language. Highly recommended, and for me a bridge to some of the other classics that I was forced to read as a boy,
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|Well, after the over-compressed Nevermind remaster, DR 7 vs DR 10, this one is in good hands and you get some really nice goodies to boot. The full dynamic range is intact, which leads us to wonder what happened to Nevermind. Although that album I guess could lend itself to a slightly different sound, I still feel the DR 6 values and DR7 ones are generally overboard. Around DR9 is generally where you want an album to be for loud rock albums in my opinion. Higher values can start to blur things a little too much.<br /><br />This item includes the original mix remastered well on disc one with all the extras of the time including some Albini mixes from the day that didn't make the record. This album as a whole had some considerable problems with mixing as Kurt and Co. were not totally happy with some things, but I will let someone else explain that to you or many stories on google abound.<br /><br />What you need to know is that Albini has superbly remixed the whole album and that is available to you on disc 2. A more raw and less produced version it is really awesome and totally fits in with the original as well. You can hear a lot of the rhythm guitars and other sounds that I think add to the album in a good way. Other little differences will make themselves known easily to true fans. We should be going crazy over the fact they didn't mess this release up. It is FINALLY looking like the loudness wars are at least being reigned in from all the mass fan disapproval. At least somewhat.<br /><br />The third disc is a decent sounding Live and Loud disc from the era that fans will again appreciate for being here. Now for the terrible part... the price of the super deluxe is insane. Well, you can be satisfied with the 2CD as that one is much more appropriate.<br /><br />If you are diehard and don't have the money well there are other places you can find this including the 24-96 resolution format. I'll leave that up to you. But this could not have turned out better imo. They did everything right. Albini got his full remix in with the band helping out, and you also have the original here too as well as a live disc all remastered in perfect glory for audiophiles and casual music fans alike. THIS is how you do a remaster project!did everything right.

B00F4ID7JE|1.0|The only people who would like this snoozefest are beatniks sitting around a coffee shop listening to poems. You'd have to force me to listen to this at gun point. And to think of all the great songs Sting has written. Not this time. Just poetry, no melody, no good chorus, no beat, not music at all.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|You'll think about this book for days or weeks after you finish it.  Why don't more authors write like this??
B000FC1RCI|4.0|My son was required to read it as a school assignment and he's not an avid reader like me. He really enjoyed it.  I think I'll read it again!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|A little thrown together from episodes past but still enjoyable. 3D is great, had to duck when the spears came out of the TV to kill me. LOL. This episode should have had elder Spock coaching the younger Spock how to sling-shot around the sun to go back in time. They then could have set time back to correct what the Romulans screwed-up, saved Romulus, Vulcan and all the people destroyed including Kirk's father and Spock's mother. Too bad the visionaries didn't see this. But as the old saying goes, they called off the clairvoyant society's annual meeting due to unforeseen circumstances!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Continuing the story with new alliances.  Are the dragons a bonus or a detriment.  Just always want more.  Characters keep evolving in fascinating ways.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I loved this book so much!! This book has an amazing story and awesome characters. You should definitely read it!!!!!!! :)
