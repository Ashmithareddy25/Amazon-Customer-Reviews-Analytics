B00KI31986|5|Priced right and fast shipping.
B007O3PP0G|5|Well made OEM.  Took about 15 minutes to install.  Get a tube of 3M weatherstrip/gasket adhesive and a small brush.  Fit my 2006 Jeep Commander
B001BJUCTI|5|Excellent quality.  Great price.
B00KBAQHII|4|Perfect replacement part for my Nissan Altima '06. Shipping time is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
B009MBAXWS|5|Fit good
B00GC0ZOYE|5|better than OEM
B000EDSTAG|5|I bought this as an alternative to trying to fix (yet again) the starter for my gas (propane) grill.<br />My grill has 4 independent elements which all need to be lit separately (lighting one doesn't automatically light the others).<br /><br />I was a little bit cautious as I have seen some reviews that the spark created was too small, but I also know that the spark from the original ignition device was small for each one, so I thought this would work. I had previously tried the extended reach lighters (very common) but they typically only reach 4.5-5 inches and I needed something at least 6 inches long to reach the burners to light them or I had to lift the cast iron grates. So I was hoping this would do the trick.<br /><br />Bottom line: It worked. It typically lit each burner in less than half a second each. I didn't get any strong propane smells which tells me I'm not having too much gas flowing before ignition occurs (this is good).<br /><br />What I liked about this:<br />- It doesn't require a safety switch to operate... you just pull the trigger.<br />- If you hold the trigger, it will create continuous sparks to try and light the fuel from your source (in my case the propane coming through the burner)<br /><br />What I didn't like about this:<br />The spark is recessed a slight bit inside the tube. I am sure this is a safety mechanism and prevents people from giving other humans a light shock... it did make the lighting a little more difficult because I couldn't put the spark exactly where I wanted it.<br /><br />In the end, I am happy. For less than the price of fixing (yet again) the lighting mechanism built into my grill, I have a device that works and can be used even after I replace the grill in a couple years as needed. Time will tell if it works for years.<br /><br />Sidenote about the included C-battery. Whenever you get batteries with items, they are often an inexpensive version and I fully expect them to fail in short time --- so I typically use abetter battery to begin with. I am using the one that came with the sparker just to see how long it lasts... which I expect will be a couple months. After that I'll just put in a stronger one and be happy again.
B009W1SEYM|2|These gloves in my opinion are for light duty. The leather is really thin however they are more durable than I expected. I thought I'd be going through a pair of gloves more frequently than I do. They were okay for the price but I don't think I'll be buying them again
B00P9OF04I|2|Not impressed with the product at all. Lots of scrubbing with minimal results. Maybe works better with little oxidation but any amount over medium I would not recommend.
B00C1QGTJC|5|Really nice and clean die-cut decal. Its make of a sturdy white vinyl and it sticks really well too!
B003LS768M|2|could not get it to stay in place
B0014BBLF2|5|I purchased these rear pads for a 2006 Tiburon GT and I just finished installing them.  They fit perfectly!  I took the old ones out and installed these in without any problem.  The new brakes have great stopping power.  Now I have to get used to the new feeling on the brake pedal as just tapping on it causes the car to slow down and stop. Overall, I am very satisfied with these pads.
B000C9DHE0|5|WORKS AS IT SHOULD
B001AY2WLU|4|Perfect stocking stuffer
B002LBO5VG|5|These things are almost five years old and work as good as new.
B00VIVXLQU|5|Beautiful Running Board Design. Great Product - As Advertised!!!
B002XL2IBS|5|Great tool to clean all twists and turns inside the water heater.  A garden hose will simply not get your heater clean enough due to small particles being trapped inside the unit.  A must have to prolong the life of the heater!
B0007LMCCG|4|great brush!
B0043IX2GO|3|Great items. And super fast shipping. Thank you !
B0050NAV24|1|TITE fit
B000CQ4DIM|5|its grease, it greases things, works good.
B000F39BLQ|4|Nice fit for my 2008 civic si. I went with the smoke color. Keeping the dash cool is a good idea if you live in a hot area.
B004C443S0|4|Nice snug fit.Hopefully in time it will stretch a little.
B00TQ6GMOW|5|Got it installed and works and looks great
B00590WYAA|5|Perfect bolt on installation on my 2014 FJ Cruiser.  It takes maybe 10 minutes per side to swap them out.<br />The best part is they cost HALF what the Trail Teams mirrors cost. These are NOT heated, but my remote mirror controls work and the lights as well.
B00JFW1EAE|5|Got it for my IS-II helmet, no problems.
B00SC823WA|5|Worked very well. Completely satisfied with the product and service
B000COMX3Q|5|Perfect fit. No problem getting them installed and they are well weighted; have felt no vibrations or anything.
B00B1UN4OW|5|I had the original cloth mats, which I didn't like.... So glad I ordered these for my 2013 ATS Cadillac..... When I spill debris on the mats, it is so easy to clean.... Love them....
B007ZDU05U|5|These shocks are great! Better than OEM. They look and perform great. The entire housing is metal unlike OEM shocks. These shocks also have larger diameter and work amazing. These will also work with a shackle kit up to 2&#34; drop. I would recommend!
B003WOXOD6|5|OK
B001C6Q34S|5|very good
B00ONGXE64|4|Perfect fit.
B005XRH2YC|5|Item came promptly. It fits toyota correctly.
B007G7PWSA|5|I've been using Castroll oil since I changed my own oil in my MG-TD and then my MGB.  This full synthetic Castrol grade is specified by Audi for my A4 Cabriolet & it is used by the dealer.  I don't change my own oil anymore, but the Audi burns oil between changes and needs to  be topped up.  My Audi dealer will top it up for free, but to save trips to them, I top it up myself.  Prefer to buy a case for less than local store that is generally out of the specified grade.  Keep it in the garage.  You can't go wrong with this and it was delivered quickly.
B000JZ33H8|5|This is a perfect flasher relay replacement when upgrading the front and rear turn signals to LEDs.  This relay will prevent the hyper flash issue.  Worked great on my 2003 F150 XL, direct replacement.  The relay will take place of splicing resistors into each of the turn signals.  Flasher relay replacement is a more reliable option as well.
B00DR156K8|5|Good product fast shipping/ easy to install
B007CLSJRQ|5|Easy to install , and they really work
B00GU9A9Z6|5|Worked great
B00IWO4K8O|5|Perfect for Grandchildren
B00B5KYS9I|5|Fit perfectly.
B008PIITT8|3|Probably best suited to the base Impreza but not better than worn shocks on a WRX or STI. My struts and shocks were shot. leaking on the pistons and elsewhere and I wanted a decent replacement set since I might be trading the car sooner than later. Packaging was good and the shocks were pretty easy to install for a first timer with air tools and a QUALITY spring compressor.<br /><br />I notice less bounce than the blown set but I wouldn't call these performance rated as these don't seem firm enough for the performance side of things. I would have gone the Koni route, but the cost and modification necessary drove me away.<br /><br />*** I would NOT try these with aftermarket springs with a higher rate than the WRX comes with.
B003VGHBMA|5|fit great on my g6
B00FJW62WE|5|Perfect fit
B0053TVKN4|3|The ball sits to close to the heat shield on my muffler which inhibits a trailer from latching onto the ball. If ground clearance isn't a issue you can flip this item over and add another ball which will space the hitch out another inch which makes attaching to the new ball possible. However, this still doesn't quite space the ball out enough to get the traiIer to attatch. Personally if I were buying this for a rzr I would just buy a hitch with a 2-3&#34; rise and skip this product.
B00C6NHASE|5|Love this sticker! So cute and lasts so long!!
B001CFFWEG|5|Finally was able to find this little part to fix my Windshield Washer set up.
B000BRJUTO|5|Works as advertised!
B002UD0GIG|3|It ruined my prescription glasses, though I believe it warns against using it for them... I went by what other reviewers had said. That was a mistake.
B0082B2246|4|Looks great just a little pricey
B00KYWZY1E|5|Perfect fit makes old remote look almost new.
B00VX2NP4W|5|This is a fantastic product as it provides important performance information about a Diesel engines operating parameters as stored and/or registered in the engines ECM. This is a great product as it can easily be connected to both SAE protocols used for the diagnostic ports on Diesel engines going back to 1987.  This includes the first version of SAE protocol J1708 that used a 6-pin configuration for the diagnostic port, as well as the more current SAE protocol J1939 which is a 9-pin configuration of the diagnostic port.<br />This is a wonderful product and would highly recommend to a friend.
B000CSRA12|5|Fit well, easy to install.  Looks great!
B00EAOIHMK|5|Works great, OEM replacement.
B00IZK51VU|5|Awesome shocks!
B008494IHK|4|OK chain and much less expensive than the Yamaha OEM by a long ways, but they really should have included a quick link.
B0027QWNDM|5|Perfect size for glovebox.
B006Z907TY|5|Worked perfectly
B0049NJP2I|4|Would be nice if they came compressed for easier installation. Not difficult to install regardless. Seemed to help handling quite a bit both when the truck was loaded and unloaded.
B00GI77WSW|1|I have bought several pairs of these trying to get them to work, installed resistors with no luck and then changed out flasher module. Worked for a few weeks and then LED's start flickering and go out completely within a few months whereas they are supposed to last &#34;50,000 hours&#34;. I purchased all of the pairs from O'Reilly's and at $20+ a pop, it added up quick for something that absolutely will not last you. Don't waste your time with Pilot automotive if you want to make the switch to LED. Spend a little more money for something that will actually last you.
B007SCODZQ|1|Covers tiny area of trunk.
B001QN8CGO|5|Cool item!

B00R1FZOO4|4|I put to start on in less then  10 minutes with no problem working fine .
B007TY0G1I|4|Some instructions on how to install would have been nice. Removed the hood to realize it did not have to be removed to replace the new plastic
B00V9XGQ5U|5|[[VIDEOID:87099a04ca4b6dc0bebe2741ece0fae7]] I have been looking for a good truck organizer for some time so when I ran across this one on Amazon I thought I would give it a try.  The description says that it will hold up to forty pounds and I tested it at near that amount with no problems.  You have two large compartments for holding whatever you need from groceries, emergency supplies, or even your childrens' sporting supplies.  The organizer measures about 20&#34; in length and about 12&#34; in width.  The two compartments measure 6&#34; in height in the front and 9.5&#34; in height in the back.  It has four small mesh pockets on the front and one mesh pocket on each side.  The organizer folds up nicely to about an inch in width for storage.  It also has two carrying handles that feel pretty sturdy.  Overall I am glad that I have this organizer.  It is really going to help me get my trunk organized and not be such a mess.

B0057GU6YM|1|Delivered promptly but does not match the Lexus pearl color.
B00GRHRTEU|5|I mounted one of these mirrors on the console of my boat.  It worked out great.  The mirror is very sturdy, doesn't vibrate, and has a clear view.
B0000V0EB4|5|Great space saving product for RV. Napkins are always handy and easy to install and refill.
B009LJYNVS|5|Excellent product and service! Fast shipping as well. Thanks again
B00332GN0I|5|Easy installation. Perfect fit and they work as advertised! Not A/C, but b etter than the alternative.<br />A/C died on my 1998 Dakota. Repair estimate was close to $1,000. Easy decision.
B00BCRMAAS|2|They keep sliding off the seats and after only 3 weeks the material is getting snagged.
B001KOHXJG|5|I already own the Schampa Double Layer Fleece Short Neck Gaiter.  Worked great, but wanted something I could pull up to cover my nose and face without pulling it out of my jacket and loosing the neck protection.  This fits the bill perfectly!  Blocks the wind and keeps you warm!
B003GYV8A8|1|This product literally did nothing. It did not clean any crumbs or dirt on any surface I tried it on. I would highly recommend not wasting your money and instead investing in a higher quality of cleaner.
B000C0UMNS|5|Perfect fit great quality 1999 WJ 4.7
B0024ECIP0|5|Worked great..........
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|This product is very high quality & best of all, it works.
B0002RNSJG|5|Perfect fit, quick delivery. Very happy.
B005XRQ5GI|5|5 stars so far, great fit and looks for my 2005 Yukon SLT. Will update if any issues such as leaking, fogging etc come up. UPDATE:  had them for months now, no problems. Great deal and look awesome.
B00837RVBI|3|Not as sturdy as expected.
B0002RNSLO|5|works great
B007EES23M|5|Its perfect, just what i was looking for, Thanks<br />I cannot find two metals awarded to me from Viet - Nam, my bronze star and my army commendation metal.<br />Can you help.  Thanks, Seymour Jones
B00J4Z9WUQ|5|Awesome seller and product
B0046IC24O|1|The remote button never worked.  My auto mechanic could not get it to work.  He programmed two genuine FORD remotes and both worked the first time. Unfortunately, I missed the return date to send this back to the seller.
B00A8OD8CU|5|This was an aftermarket filter but it worked great with a perfect fit!
B002XM5G70|5|Good price, quality and service
B00TZF06VO|5|It's great to find a complete kit of parts to keep older products running, and this kit is no exemption. All the parts fit perfectly, and great installation instructions . Would buy from LiftMaster again.
B000JKQV8G|5|Easy tool free install. Still performing superbly
B00Z0CXLH2|1|Don't waste your money. These suck. They can't stand the vibration so u constantly have to keep adjusting then. The screws wore out in 2 days from trying to fasten them all the time. Plus they are too small to see the car behind u unless u duck down more. These really suck.
B007Z1FSKO|5|Removed my old H badge with fishing line + my wife's hairdryer. Cleaned the paint with Goo Gone and some car polish. New badge looks great and fit perfect on my '12 Genesis Sedan RSpec.
B0024E6ZW2|5|works well
B001HLFWXQ|5|MATCHES MY NEW JEEP CHEROKEE SEATS
B000F1698G|5|Looks great
B008EXHNZA|2|Used it in my moped. Bought April 2015, stopped working August 2015. Had to buy another one, but this time from another seller. For $6, lasted 4 months, not too bad, however pain in the butt to drain the gas from the tank and reinstall this valve.
B004JAU4QM|4|Fairly well built and sturdy for an aluminum box. I'd like the latches and strikers be stronger and more of a precision piece.
B00F73F7BW|5|Was exactly what I expected.
B004QU8W9G|5|good chains
B003N1VQVK|5|better than the original that came with the trailer
B00B4XDO8M|4|worked as the ad says.... took along to to receive...
B00BVPTM2A|5|Worked as described
B0024EC74M|5|Good!!!
B00JH2GMMC|5|Works great, saved me $225
B009XZW0CY|2|Changed color after 2 weeks, it became brass in color. :(
B00LV18KWM|1|I read a review that said the same thing as I'm about to say but I disregarded and purchased anyways, thinking I could force it to fit. But there is no way to insert this device in between the hitch and my bike rack. That's because although the bike rack wobbles, the space required to insert the wedge part is too narrow. There must be enough space on two sides, not just one. Interesting concept, but would need luck to fit.
B0000AY69V|4|This works pretty well.  I use it on my car after I wash it, and it doesn't leave any streaks or anything.
B00AESJFIQ|5|Good 😃
B00L1SI9O4|5|Excellent product
B00802GIW4|4|Good quality product! At first, I ordered the other HID brand from Apex but I wasted so much time, effort & still didn't work. Terrible! This worked from the beginning as it is plug-n-play & took about 10 minutes to install. Funny thing is I ordered a Kensun HID relay with it because I had so much problem w/ the other brand (Apex) & wanted a backup just in case but I didn't need it as it worked fine without it. As I stated it is of good quality as all harness, ballast, light bulb & other parts seem to be solid. I even really like the 8000k color which I thought might be too blue but it's not as it looks close to factory of some manufacturers. Very glad I ordered this as it seems like a bargain for the price. I will update & verify how long & durable the product is as I want to give it 5 stars but will wait & see if the quality is still there after some time passes as that is the true test. Love it so far. Thanks Kensun.
B008E7QS5C|3|The pads being semi-metallic, are noticeably louder than my old ones. They still function and stop fine.
B00L8446YI|1|I have a 06 dakota and this site said that it fit my truck but it didnt I had to build a bracket for them to work and even after installing they looked nice but the lights are garbage they are only for looks they are not bright at all so do yourself a favore and dont get these they are trash
B00HAPHS80|1|i received its broken and made in chaina!!
B00V8T3Y6E|5|More light than anticipated, these things are bright!!
B00KQNPL0U|5|Fit great! Super easy to install.

B0085IJVBI|5|Bon produit
B004K7C1IS|1|Flywheel poorly manufactured.Spacing on crank sensor windows incorrect.Vehicle would barely run and constantly set crank sensor codes.Went to junkyard and purchased a used O.E. Jeep flywheel and installed it.Problem solved.Wasted countless hours because of this.Learned my lesson.Buy O.E. only for this application.
B003TQ5TMG|5|I got these for my 2007 Wrangler JK after the Jeep's shock mount upper broke on the rear drivers side.  The shock was dragging and messed up the top part of the shock.  I didn't realize that was a blessing.  Because I have the Skyjacker 3&#34; suspension lift, and the lower end price shocks I got with it are CRAP!!  The Jeep rode like a tank, it was so rough I took the rear tire mount off and I suspect this is why the upper shock mount broke.  I picked up these N8037 shocks which are an upgrade option on the lift kit I got, I should have went with the more expensive shocks when I got the lift kit, my bad.<br />I was hoping a set of these would improve the ride and they did.<br />I am going to upgrade the front now.  These really do work, trust me, after one year of getting my ribs slammed (because of the big tires), these softened the ride with the larger tires.  I felt the difference right away.  I ordered these along with the  Rough Country - 1089 - Rear Shock Upper Bar Pin Eliminator Kit  the change out was very easy.  It seems to set higher also, so I may be getting the full advantage of the lift kit.
B007ZGKKMA|5|The lights are great, my only problem was that the mounting system only lets you mount them on a straight forward surface, if the surface is not facing the exact way yoou want the lights to face there isnt any adjustments. up and down is great
B000GOF4YC|4|I am happy  with  the Fan/blower for my Jeep  thank you
B001NZ0SP8|5|This was the part I needed and fast delivery
B00NIP1H38|5|Awesome product and service!
B004N63S9W|5|Works great
B00274QIVM|5|definitely a great buy as it fixed my starting problems.
B00A8NXRVS|4|Very cheap way to enhance your car's look and easy to install. However, one of the signals wasn't completely sealed perfectly and some water got in the light itself. We dried it out and sealed it again ourselves and then it worked well.
B001KS8706|3|I was disappointed that this was not the full mirror with assembly backing. I had specified heated and I didn't realize I was getting a &#34;mirror&#34; to stick over top of the cracked one. I guess it will work fine. I only needed the glass mirror part but it was only $9 so it will be fine.
B00KGGTF9U|5|Awesome Shade! Easy to put up, Easy to take down and store! Keeps the car cool, saves on AC...... Great Product! Seller answered my questions immediately! Thanks X-Shade!
B00S0O02HE|5|perfect
B000C9WL6A|5|It's an oil filter. Yahoo!
B001FJICOG|5|I use Mobil 1 oil and filters on my 2 cars. Quality oil and filters you can trust. This is my 1st time buying the Extended Performance Filter and I'm very pleased. Comes with 2 o-rings and plastic drain.  Yes - more expensive than others but if you're going to DIY, then you can afford to spend extra for quality parts and oil.   Excellent filter, I would def recommend.
B009NVUIL8|5|Quickly delivered and the product looks like it will do the job for a lot less than the local dealer would charge me.
B002VFAOEO|5|This worked great in my Xterra.
B0012TZ1RU|5|The only brand I would use for my bike.
B00775LIWK|1|Failed on first use.  Bought winch to use with a crank-up tower.  Used heavy duty low speed electric drill (500 rpm max no-load) to power winch.  On first use, worm gear bushings were smoking when tower nearly extended.  Drill operating well below 600 rpm limit specified by manufacturer. Allowed winch to cool before bring tower down.  Almost immediately after starting down, two parts fell out of winch and worm gear was very loose.  Managed to carefully get tower down and take load off winch.  Discovered that one worm gear shoulder bushing had broken, leaving worm gear very loose and making winch essentially inoperable.  Winch will not operate to manufacturer's specifications.
B00JUX1DRW|4|Pretty easy installation.  Secures phone as described, and is easily maneuverable.
B001GP0C24|5|Caused radio interfence after some time. Could of been the ballast also
B004GE6LU4|5|perfecto
B00029WVI8|4|I purchased this for my Chevy Duramax.  Works great when I'm pulling a trailer and my mirror's are extended.  But, for daily driving they are a bit large.  Should have went with the 2x2's.  No complaints
B00GRSOJSS|3|worked well enough.
B00T2HWK3W|5|Nice adapter at a great price!
B00PSRORH2|4|I have just started using it but it sticks well!

B00Q9YSWH4|5|very bright lights
B00UM9UCE8|5|I ordered a cabin filter for a Kia Optima, the filter I received was for a Hyundai Sonata, I know these vehicles are compatible but this filter was slightly larger than the dealer installed one.
B00KQHACMI|5|Shipping was fast. Steppers work great. My only problem was soldering the small pieces. So it all depends on your abilities.
B000HBM5TQ|5|Works Great
B0077FJOJE|5|Item just as described and fast shipping. The condenser seemed a bit smaller than the OEM, but no complaints...AC is COLD!
B000BNXRVK|5|Perfect.
B00BGZ2H0Y|4|Fits so snugge on my key. I love it!!
B000P7O5DG|5|It definitely gives power to the unit!  Not sure how else to rate that.  And...it's still working.
B00K889FCI|5|Cleared up lens like new
B00COOS5NY|5|I have had Extreme HID kit from Xenon depot since 2003.  probably paid like $250 or so at the time. The bulb went out couple weeks ago.<br /><br />I just finished installing this and the quality and price are Great.<br /><br />Hopefully they last me like my old HID kit!<br /><br />Lightning blue color!
B004AR1D32|3|The small bypass hole is not really needed.<br />I just cut it out the shape of the Housing and it works/performs the same.<br />By removing the small bypass hole, this would prevent any clogging of debri. (Longterm)
B00PT18QAQ|5|This is an aesome gauge. Beats the ones found at autozone. Its big, but fir me that is good.
B00W0H2FL8|2|2 stars because there´s no better than the original bulbs! Bad light!
B00DWVN08I|5|Fit as expected.
B00D8ZKJJQ|5|Amazon stated this did not fit my 2011 F350SD. I have the XLT package. I got them anyway because they looked correct and they ended up fitting like a glove. Easy to install and great fit. I would recommend these to anyone!
B0077K8TXG|5|great value for the price
B000COB48G|3|What can you say about dust caps?  OK, they fit.  They seem sturdy enuf.
B0001CMUV4|5|Works great.
B00S11I57A|5|nice
B003LS2PW4|5|Super easy to install on my wife's RX350, I use K&N on my IS300 so I already have the air filter cleaner and oil. Never have to buy another air filter ever again. Fast shipping, great price and super easy.
B00RDM2WCW|5|I love them. Fits my 2014 RAV4 LE Perfectly.
B006GJKBGC|5|Love em thanks a million
B002DW256A|5|Works very well. Looks good. I couldn't be happier.
B00J4P9HR4|5|Love them
B0068FUC4U|1|Bike runs no better, or worse than prior to the installation of this coil. Save your money, this was a disappointment!
B000C9R1D8|5|My car is an '02 and I hated that my &#34;attachment cord&#34; broke the other week. Couldn't resist order for $12. I'm happy :)
B00029X5WO|1|After giving this item a good year of use, I say, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. YOU DON'T NEED THE AGRAVATION THAT COMES WITH THIS PRODUCT. Believe all the bad reviews. These used to be great. Someone else bought the company or something and screwed them up!
B00BL0RNZ8|5|Product fits good. A little lower than others, ear warmers work great<br /><br />Dealing with company was good experience
B00HJQ7IOO|3|&#34; Came from factory with only 1 row of holes punched &#34;. It did fit ok though. Looks better than the one that came off.
B00HS0GXM4|1|Beware Buyers these are JUNK had them on my 92 BMW 525i they lasted a Month and a few days Don't believe APX Auto parts Lift Time Warrantee is very Limited actually they are a Joke!!!  when the front drivers side strut went out like I said one month and a few days I contacted APX Auto Parts to get the life time warrantee or any warrantee  the wanted me to repurchase a new pair and send them back the inferior parts they sold me and then they will determine if the will refund my your money Its not like I was going off road it's a sedan for crying out loud....<br />I would never buy anything from them ever!!!!
B000JJHR80|5|great product
B0031ZDU62|5|Great price!!!! Made my truck run 100% better
B004940ZNK|5|Perfect fit for 2008 Pontiac g6. Installed in approximately 20 minutes. Resolved issue of turn signal not returning to neutral position after making turns.
B002E1AYTU|1|I put this on my wish list and my wife bought this for me for my birthday.  It didn't have a weight limit on it as I am 6' tall and weigh 230 lbs I figured it would be strong enough.  I was wrong.  I've had it since middle of July 2015 and first off, if you want to use it on a driveway that has a broom finish you might want to think twice as the tires are all tore up and I've only used it maybe 6 times max.  Second, it comes with little plugs to cover up the holes so that the nuts are hidden which all popped off the first time i used it (no big deal).  Third and last, the plastic ripped apart at one of the casters which rendered it mostly useless.  I would've figured that something you pay over $40 for would stand up to a little more of the typical use it gets than this one did.
B006N9FNLI|1|Do not buy. Had installed for 1 month and they broke off.
B004EK94P4|5|Super wide and fits well. Very strong and visible.
B00ARZEMBQ|5|Praise be to Jah!
B0014ZND5Y|5|Love it because last year I had my prop stolen but not with this bad boy..
B00VAVUYQ8|5|Excellent, arrived faster than expected and was a perfect fit.
B010JRL2MS|5|I was a little skeptical purchasing these window visors as they were much cheaper than others I found online. But after placing these on my car I am very pleased at the quality and ease of installation of these! They have a nice design that follows the accents of the Honda Fit 2015 side! They work very well and allow for my window to remain 1&#34; open even in heavy rain (which has been tested). 3M adhesive is also well-known for retaining stickiness so there shouldn't be any issue with the window visors falling off. I would highly recommend purchasing these for any Honda Fit 2015 to keep your car significantly cooler during the summer months!
B002LF43O6|5|GREAT PRODUCT - GOOD FAST SHIPPING - THANKS

B00QKGD63Q|5|Great product... Turns heads
B00B2ATAWQ|5|I coated my roof about four months ago and have now had time to see what it does in the 105F Texas sun.  Before the coating on a mid-nineties day with full sun the A/C could get the interior 'livable' but not really comfortable and would run continuously all afternoon until the sun went down. Now, on our 104F days with full sun the interior is comfortable and the A/C will cycle on and off if I do not set the temperature too low. It also does not get as hot inside when I just have it parked with no A/C.  I recommend it and will do it again when the time comes.  Definitely worth the extra cost.  Follow directions and do it all in one day.  Two gallons was more than enough for my 24' Class C.
B001KS6GQ8|5|Perfect fitment for OEM.
B0007P2W7W|5|Great Looking Product “We will do business again”  “Thank You”
B005JU5UEW|5|Fits well on my 2009 Prius. No issues so far.
B00WOY33EA|4|I bought these to repair the disintegrated cable ends in the main back door of my 2000 E350 Econoline.  I definitely appreciate that these are available; they work very well and I don't ever expect them to fail and are probably quite deserving of the 5-star rating assigned by most reviewers, but there was one thing I didn't quite like.  The solid aluminum material is both a blessing and a curse, in my opinion.  The aluminum is so strong and rigid that it was very difficult to &#34;pop&#34; them into the receptacles in the door latch mechanisms, and I felt like I was &#34;buggering them up&#34; in the process.  If I ever had to remove them I doubt that it would be possible without damaging them to the point where they probably wouldn't stay inserted a second time around.  Those latch mechanisms were designed to receive a rubber/plastic cable-end that can flex and compress during insertion, then expand to tightly fit the receiving receptacle once in place.  If these replacement parts had the same larger diameter to allow them to fit snugly in the slot once inserted, you would never be able to force them into the opening.  As such, they appear to strike a compromise between being small enough to snap into the opening yet large enough not to pop back out, but this means that they don't have the same slot diameter as the original parts and they &#34;flop around&#34; in the opening quite a bit once inserted.  I kept checking them to convince myself that they weren't going to pop back out, and I even forced a screwdriver into the cable slot of one to see if I could pry it open more so that it would snug up in the receptacle (not very successful with that).  If it was possible to make these less rigid so they would flex and spring into position, that would make them a 5-star product for me.
B009VOQ05U|5|Good rack,fit good and has many uses
B00LHKRV72|5|Four and a half bucks, free shipping and arrived in about two weeks from China Post. Works just as described. A+ Value.
B001KVW6EQ|4|This will serve the purpose.
B002ZTNWZ4|5|Perfect fit.
B000WJ2XGS|4|This was purchased for installation with Pro Taper Contour Woods High handlebars on a 2011 Suzuki DR650  The mount is quality constructed.  These will install on a DR650 as long as you use the original bolts as the ones supplied were not designed to fit on the DR.  These mounts are not compatible with the TCI Windscreen because the bolt heads are recessed into the mount.  If you wish to use these and install a TCI Windscreen you will have to buy two longer bolts and stack washers into the recess until they are flush with the face of the top of the mount.  Anyway, I could go on but I won't, they are a good product.
B003UWTJ2A|5|Shines great, easy to apply.
B00429Y8ZI|5|I have ordered several and they are great. However, at least one came with the LED light DOA.
B0014B85TM|5|I purchased these front pads for a 2006 Tiburon GT and I just finished installing them.  They fit perfectly!  I took the old ones out and installed these in without any problem.  The new brakes have great stopping power.  Now I have to get used to the new feeling on the brake pedal as just tapping on it causes the car to slow down and stop. Overall, I am very satisfied with these pads.
B001AIZ5HY|4|It's more work than you would think but it does the job well. Not perfect, but good enough.
B00CMOU64M|5|I installed this kit as part of the Tundra Brake Upgrade for 3rd Gen 4Runners (1996-2002) on my 1997 Toyota 4Runner SR5 4x4. After subjecting these brakes to over 15,000 miles of use in all four seasons (temps ranging from -25F to +118F) through snow, ice, slush, misting and torrential rain, mud and dust on most every road surface available, including concrete, asphalt, gravel, cinder, dirt, sand, and challenging 4WD trails.<br /><br />There hasn't been a single instance in any climate condition, or on any road surface that left me feeling any trepidation while applying pressure to the brake pedal. Unlike the factory disc brake caliper/pad/rotor set that it replaced after approximately 10,000 miles of use, this Power Stop KC2324 brake kit instills absolute confidence with excellent brake modulation and stopping power.<br /><br />If you are considering this as a front brake upgrade for your 4Runner, please take the time to thoroughly inspect all the major components of your entire 13+ year old braking system and repair/replace anything that needs it at the same time (rear axle bearing seals are a common failure point and adversely affect the rear drum brakes when they fail). Consider flushing and bleeding the entire brake system with a DOT4 synthetic brake fluid, instead of simply bleeding the brakes and topping off the brake fluid.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the disc brake dust shields will require minor trimming to accommodate the larger 13WL Tundra calipers included with this kit and check to make sure your wheels will clear the calipers, or replace them with wheels that do clear the calipers.<br /><br />The durability of the pads is excellent, as there is approximately 75% material remaining (measured with calipers) after more than 15,000 miles of mixed use driving. In addition, there is very little brake dust coming off these pads, which helps to keep my wheels looking good! The instructions included with this kit are clear and well organized, especially the details regarding the proper break-in procedure for optimum long-term performance and wear.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brake kit as an upgrade to every 3rd Gen 4Runner owner I meet. In fact, they look so good behind my wheels that I am often asked about them before I get the chance to make a recommendation.<br /><br />Note: My 4Runner is frequently loaded with camping gear, extra equipment, kayaks, bicycles and occasionally towing a trailer, so I really appreciate both the reliable stopping power, plus the long lasting pads and rotors.etails regarding the proper break-in procedure for optimum long-term performance and wear.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brake kit as an upgrade to every 3rd Gen 4Runner owner I meet.

B00N5BAWYK|5|Look very well made. Match my 5000k HID headlight color very well. Pretty happy.
B00S55D1OY|5|perfect
B00LOR6O9O|4|Bolts sufficient, lots of extra hardware. Nice black finish. Generic bolts, though. Nothing close to OEM fitment here - have to experiment a bit.
B001XUD46S|5|great product. Easy installation
B00KQW6GCI|5|Don't let the lack of reviews scare you. This fuel line is awesome! Take your time installing, remove your gas tank(which is probably in need of replacement anyways) take off your right rear wheel and your in the money! So nice and every bend in the right spot. I chose steel rather than braided or Teflon because of the durability and factory look. I'm happy with my purchase.
B00HWPYU6Q|3|Easy to install and looks legit to me. After a few months I've noticed the white tint has gotten slightly dingy and turned into more of a pale off-yellow. Not a huge deal, but something to take into consideration. I would definitely recommend this as a short term solution to a lost of broken BMW emblem, but if you're looking for something that you want for the lifetime of your car, you might just wanna go to your local dealer.
B000IYBEWQ|4|What an I say, seem to work great on my 1998 Nissan Frontier. Replaced the originals which were 17 years old w\179,000 miles.
B007CN9IJW|5|Product as described and works great......
B002P8EMK4|4|fit like a glove
B007Y2D3YM|1|They look nice and ship fast.  These will not fit a 2014 dodge ram quad cab.  These were not listed correctly by either amazon or zigs auto.  Seller would except the return; however, it costs $120 to ship them back.  I paid 130 for them.  Therefore, I can not return them.  I buy a ton from amazon bu I would not buy an item like this that is heavy and bulky.  Lesson learned and you have been advised - since you are stuck if if does not actually fit.
B00029WVJC|3|Redurned.
B004I0L5I4|5|Perfect fit and even better price!
B004F8U7SS|5|Very easy to remove engine with this plate.  While, I would not lay underneath an engine being lifted, I trusted it completely. The tensile strength of a 1/4-20 grade 2  bolt is around 2300 lbs. Multiply that times 4 leaves a pretty good safety margin. If you pull all the treads out of a manifold, you are doing something wrong.
B00EALBAMW|5|well engineered, quality workmanship
B00221I65Q|3|its a sticker.....
B006H34BUY|5|Nice handy size.  Well made.  With a quick flick of the wrist over your dashboard and dust is gone.  It does what it's supposed to do.
B0006JLW84|4|Perfect fit, easy installation.
B009Y8CCAA|5|Very useful  and fairly easy to install.  Better quality than others I have seen.
B00192JGA8|5|Works as stated arrived on time
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Perfect.  Good quality and SUPERIOR customer service from seller.
B000PJED72|5|This is what you need for those slow-moving automatic car windows!  Just a few shots in the window channels, and the job is complete!
B004HXU3IK|5|Nice flag runs on my jeep antenna
B00IG2ZW9S|2|I was looking for a cargo liner that offered flexibility and durability for our Mazda CX9.  I wanted something that would cover all the surfaces of the cargo area with seats up or down.  This cover seemed to fit the bill however it is a compromise in every way.  It covers the surface but it is held on by straps you need to tie to the anchors of the cargo area.  This leaves gaps that dirt will inevitably get  under and/or the cover moving around if the straps loosen up.  It has a flap to protect the bumper as described but the seam is on the outside so you cannot easily sweep out the liner to clean it rather you have to remove it which is frustrating.  The attachment to the back from the cargo area to the side that covers the rear seats is velcro and it does a good job of not letting debris fall between the seats.  If you want pull the rear seats up you have to separate the two pieces and this causes the cover to flap loosely on the middle seats so, you need to remove this part of the liner if you have people sitting in the third row. Overall, the the fit and finish could be better  particularly for the price.  If your willing to spend around $100 I would go with the WeatherTech or spend a lot less and get a rubber liner at Walmart which will do practically the same thing and be less work. I'm returning mine.
B00E1SQAWY|5|Great fitment. Brakes bedded well, we'll see about longevity
B0000AY2HN|5|Use this every time I go on the water with my boat, and jet ski. Spray the engine, and jet drive to prevent corrosion from salt water.
B004CGOGFS|5|very ggod
B00UXXJHTO|1|hi das have metherbord
B008AZYFIA|5|look great and seem to be good quality.
B00KAKG43C|1|Only charges 20% before quitting
B00498DNXA|5|Prompt shipping. Match vehicle to specs.
B0009JKI9K|5|Fits perfectly on my 2013 Nissan Altima. Easy to install
B00NPIUFMM|5|these make stock bulbs look like they are not &#34;on-working&#34; . they are  a  &#34; bright white light &#34; that you can see well with. note: my vehicle has cornering lights that come on @ night with lights &#34;on&#34; and when turn signal used. great bulbs am happy with them 100%,,would  purchase again.
B000B8I61G|3|Bought it for my son to have a cup holder in the backseat. This was our second time purchasing it as the first one broke after a year. It's okay. It does the job, and although it's flimsy, it's priced low so I didn't mind repurchasing.
B000BGM7QS|4|flange was not needed as one came with dometic toilet. Account was credited but it was  not necessary to  actually return item.<br />I bought this because it was a 'usually bought together' item with toilet.
B00F5P382C|1|fit perfect, no problems
B0027AGS52|5|Great, has no issues painted center and edge is nice and well painted
B000C8PAS2|5|Usually buy Summit Kits, but these kit was a good buy since i needed just a few of the gaskets for a valve body replacement.
B004ZF39T0|1|I was baffled when I saw these bulbs for such a low price. It was exciting to see such glowing reviews too. Well, upon installing the bulbs, I was disappointed to discover that one would NOT light up, despite checking both ballasts to see if one was defective. It seems that they don't even test the bulbs before shipping them! Quality control must be subpar and I would not request a replacement order since these lights would probably burn out quickly and unexpectedly. You get what you pay for!
B000CEZT1O|5|Great price!
B00415A2JO|5|A great little bag for the hitch/ball and pin.  At first I was unsure whether a bag was really needed or just extra fluff.  Now, I'm glad to have it and use it regularly to keep my hitch/ball from getting all rusted up and from banging around inside my truck.  Additionally, this bag keeps the rust that rubs off from the trailer coupler onto the ball from getting on my trucks carpet/upholstery.  I used to think these bags were of little value; I was wrong.<br /><br />This bag is made of a very durable material with a quality zipper.  The RealTree camo print on the exterior of the bag gives it that real truck appearance.
B003BZD03K|5|perfect for the job we had to do
B00AE1M9YK|5|I really liked how this cover turned out! It does take awhile to stitch up but worth every moment in the end. Just remember you're not going through the cover itself rather than the fabric loops. I don't think I'll ever use another cover where you wrap it around the steering wheel and cover, or the elastic type again. I can feel everyone's envy when they ask about it.
B0068OS996|3|LOOKS great on the car.  Now we can open the doors.
B00T0TY27O|4|They are much much bigger (about 4× bigger) than advertised, but besides that the stickers look as advertised. I didn't use all of them, just a select few I wanted mostly because of the size. My first order never got to my house. I contacted the seller, they were friendly and sent out a replacement quickly
B007HUGX2U|5|High quality and quite heavy duty. The actual BMW symbol is a sticker but it seems to be made well.
B00BD4NOKU|3|Ok so these are tricky to install. The directions are not clear at all, the seller could do the buyers a really big favor by labeling the pillar peices PF, PR, DF, and DR. (passenger front, passenger rear and so on) It would make a huge difference and make install much easier. People think they are cut wrong and don't fit but they are actually cut perfectly. If you run into this, you have them backwards, swap them around and they will fit right. I screwed up the first side and figured it out on the driver side. That side went on  and lined up perfectly. Don't let them stick a little and try to remove them, you will bend them. Any slight bend and the piece will look wrinkled and dented after install. I have to order an entire set just to redo the driver side that got screwed up. Take your time when you dry fit it before you stick it permanently. If the seller would send me another set for free I would make a YouTube install video for  others to view and help make the install easy!
B004I12TJ2|5|Fantastic replacement for the R. It is plug-and-play and a great way to replace your existing fogs or replace the expensive ones that might not have been included with your vehicle!
B00JQO0E1G|4|Just installed it so I don't know how it'll function with use. It does seem sturdy however and fits the Elantra very well. I gave it 4 and not 5 because I feel it's overpriced and I'm sure it can be marked down.
B00GUA0KHC|5|Fast service and great price.  Installed with no problem.
B003Z9T33I|3|Working good and looks<br />good for the price
B00AM1Z67O|5|Last winter, temps got to well below zero where I live. I had VML 5w30 in while my vehicle was idling, and it was purring like a kitten. Valvoline MaxLife 5w30 is the only oil I'll use for my vehicle, which has 114,000 miles on it. Definitely worth buying!<br /><br />It's now winter of 2016 and I just changed my oil 3 days ago. Still using MaxLife, and it still works great in my vehicle! I won't use anything but Valvoline in mine or my wife's.<br /><br />I changed the oil in my vehicle yesterday. Still using VML 5w30, and at 134,200 it's still running great! I change the oil every 3000 miles, and it's still going strong. No leaks, no damage, just reliable transportation. I drive about 350 miles per week, and as long as it keeps doing what it's been doing, I'll keep using Valvoline!<br /><br />I'm now up to 140,000 miles and still using VML 5w30. I've thought about changing oils, but really, there's no reason to. VML has served me well. I just changed it not 10 minutes ago, and it still purrs like my cat! We're in for a bad winter, but I'm not worried about it! VML works well in cold temps and hasn't let me down yet! Thank you, Valvoline!<br /><br />Changed my oil again at 151,300. Still no leaks, no stalled startups. I use my truck to get back and forth to work, and am planning on keeping it til it can't be driven anymore. As long as I own it, VML is all I'll use!
B0052YFN6K|5|High quality and just what I was looking for.
B004GEYAXE|3|It showed up with a cracked corner. This may not have been the sellers fault but the outer box wasn't damaged so who knows? The part snapped in without any issues and works great. You can't tell the difference from the OEM light on the right side. I would order again. Hopefully I won't have to.
B001O7PNNM|1|Seemed to work better in all the YouTube videos...
B00H6ETIWY|1|Had to use duct tape so it would fit on 3010 mule.
B00VHGBVW2|5|Good quality and heavy duty.  Nice storage bag.
B0006I0MXG|5|Does what it is supposed to do… Easy to install works well
B0051D3MP6|5|Good product
B00MT0NC1S|5|loved it.
B003TPB3ZY|5|It's oil - it does what oil does and contains enough zinc to keep my tappets happy.
B00C5T2BPG|5|I wanted something that does not require drilling holes on to my wrangler. This was the best solution I could find and I am happy with it.
B005F2WGFU|5|This was a replacement on a GMC van.Would buy again.
B003M8YVHU|4|I've always ran edelbrocks and holle's but decided to dive into a different market. At first I hated the electric choke but after you spend some time dialing it in, it works flawlessly. Being a double pumper it uses significantly more fuel but has a much better throttle response on my 468 BBC.<br /><br />The only downside is that it's a little harder to adjust, but if you know what you're doing this isn't a downside at all.
B004PHDWMM|3|good for kitchen and garage
B00Y1HL1WO|5|perfect
B0009XC6QO|4|- the right side oil cup was misaligned when the factory tried to press it in and mashed up & doesn't fit properly. I will have to straighten it out and re press it in for a good seal. Other than that its a pretty good little unit.
B00GBQ5U1G|4|I've had them on for like 3 days so far so good I really like them
B00B2ASZ18|5|Perfect
B00B9IVRCW|5|Works great on the race car trailer. Easier to use and cuts down on time at the races.
B0036QZ8VQ|4|great product, received quickly, haven't had any bending issue as some other reviews have stated, I use them at least once or twice a week
B003VBGGU8|5|I ordered these based off of the reviews. They are great! Small but sturdy and haven't had a single issue with the clips falling off the awning.  They have held up through rain and wind.  Easy to put on and the O hook holds the light strand well and secure.  I would definitely recommend these clips
B0089ND79Q|5|Fit great and was installed by me in less than a half hour.
B000FOIJXQ|2|Product not as good as described. Had to go over with this product three times before i can see result.
B00EDOSLY6|5|Work great. Easy to change out.
B006TMMOHU|5|Arrived exactly as described, fit perfectly
B000C7TZU2|5|Good replacement for older full size Broncos.
B0032750TO|5|they fit perfectly.  as a previous reviewer stated, they fit better than the factory mats.
B00496CA90|5|Matches well the appearance of the original wiper on a 2008 Sequoia.<br />Durability is to be seen.<br />Very easy to install and is as low profile as the original (some other models get the wiper arm high which causes noise with the winds at high speeds)
B0055DRMR6|2|built well,but does not fit well at all
B00J2CI7K2|5|goods
B00J5IOS1A|5|direct replacement for my courtesy lights on the 280 Rinker
B000C2E4HG|5|all good
B00EI6GAAQ|5|does the job
B00JHK81X2|5|I gave this to my granddaughter who just turned 16 for her car.
B00XND3AVC|4|Good!
B004ZF4MW8|5|Had minor issue, but problem resolved, recommended
B00Z7KIZPA|5|My wife saw this on an infomercial and was transfixed by the idea. Not too keen on her purse on the floor next to me, to kick, cagoule, mutilate, spindle and such by just sitting there and being a husband with jimmy legs.  So I broke out the $$$ and it showed up and it works! Built decently,  easy to attach (RTFM - nah...but there is a guide) and it has not melted in the Florida sun. Wife is happier - I have more leg room, and got several extra sexy time sessions for it. Fine job, Purse Pouch! I thought you might  be a useless piece of crap with a cutesy name, but no! You're a giving, functional utility designed for a lady's purse that even helps a man out!
B0055PD1H4|5|This stuff is amazing, just used on my 2005 Ford Escape and it now looks brand new. Plastic trim went from chalky white to nice black, trick will be how long it lasts but so far I am very pleased.
B000F0Z4AQ|5|Gave a car a quick facelift instantly, it was east to install, I love it. The mat arrived quickly, I would highly recommend..
B004U3XIE8|5|This was a very good price for this pickup.
B00K9BE4KM|5|As someone who has relatives on both sides of &#34;The Pond&#34;, I felt it appropriate to pay homage to both nations with this nice little decal on my Jeep. Equally appropriate since I live so close to the border region (Detroit/Windsor area).
B007V2DMGE|5|Fits the front window perfectly!!!
B00T564EIY|5|Been used for a few long days in the RV. Mostly to run two laptops and misc small electronics. Seems to sip power from the battery compared to my old inverter. I love the voltage/wattage display. The 5volt USB charging ports have been very useful.  Good mounting and wiring hardware included. It may not be a &#34;pure sine&#34; but everything I have used it with has worked very well.
B002QEHJFM|5|fast service and great price
B003BZ7MHA|5|Love this thing. it isn't that loud until you get over 3k like when merging on the highway.  around town its tame with lots of burbles when you let off the throttle.  get it over 3-4k and it screams a beautiful exhaust not that wants you to keep you foot in it.
B00WAXVMKW|5|Perfect set for DIY installs and repairs. I'm very pleased with the quality and usefulness of these tools.  I can't imagine $20+ sets being any better made, and the 4 piece set has enough tools to do most jobs I will ever need.  The three plastic tools are sturdy but thin enough edges to get behind most trim pieces.  The metal tool is great!  The forked tips are thin but strong enough for any trim work although I did not use it on the interior trim.  The plastic tools were great for removing trim pieces so I could install a new stereo without causing damage to leather or vinyl or plastic in my car.
B00OJSXV0U|5|Product functions well.  Shipping time was extremely long between date of purchase and date of delivery
B000SNK7HK|5|So happy with frames, made and presents nicely on my Sedan.
B000FQ22VE|5|good deal
B00C7Y89YG|3|I can't truly rate this item because I ordered it for the person that bought my vehicle and had it shipped to him.
B004I18S1U|5|Installed in a 2000 Dodge Ram Sport.  Very bright, very clear.
B000CP86ZE|1|I have a '15 Jeep Patriot, High Sierra Edition,  which this item states it will fit. Not only did it NOT fit, but the instructions prompt you to drill holes into your vehicle. Would not recommend.
B0025ZMFJC|4|This thing is great and significantly cheaper than others. Very good quality....but...for my 3&#34; leveling kit it was just a little too long. If you take it apart prior to install and grind the &#34;extra&#34; off at the end of the threads it then allows it to screw in enough.
B012HN7TI8|5|The screws work and they were delivered promptly. Not much more to say, lol
B008564ZQG|3|Good part, great price. Beware that this is not BMW part as advertised. Upon removal my oil coolant thermostat broke so be prepare to by some extra parts.  Design could be better.  All plastic with snap on hoses  in boiling temperature over 10 years.. WILL BREAK! but thankfully they did change it on e90/92
B00J47EOZM|5|Love them!
B0031HXZOW|4|Installed easily and so far it's working properly.
B00H43AGLE|5|Cute sticker. Easy application.
B000E3BX04|1|Ordered these and rear brake kit when installing 8&#34; lift on my 2000 F350.  What a mistake.  Poor fit, incorrect fittings, poor customer support.  What a pain.  Will NOT fit existing front brake line brackets.  Read other reviews for yourself--it's a common issue fixed by either having to fabricate your own bracket or flip/redrill your frame.  For the cost of these things and having to go through that.. really?? Nonetheless I was still determined to make these work.. nope!  Incorrect thread pitch for my existing brake lines, despite being labeled as the correct part for my vehicle.  Multiple trips to the local auto parts stores to try to locate an adapter.  Called customer service who was worthless and clueless as to what type of fittings are even supplied with the kit.  When asked what's needed to make this product work for my vehicle--dead silence.  No suggestions, no resolutions, no help.. useless!  These appear to be generic stainless steel braided lines and not vehicle specific.  Save yourself the trouble and order a better kit.  Precision metal fab kit costs the same amount and comes correctly threaded, with a vehicle specific metal bend at the banjo bolt location, in different colors, and made in the USA!  If only I had known before ordering these.  No skyjacker products for me, ever again!!
B007UHPSCG|3|There's nothing wrong with the product, except that it doesn't fit my 2014 Toyota Tacoma.  When I bought it, the product page said it was a fit for my truck, but its way too big.  Would have returned it, but gave it to a guy at work who has an F250 that it fits.
B00BLI06JK|5|Not bad for the price...
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product!
B000HNAA8W|5|Works great, but it would be nice if there was a charge indicator.
B00U2NXJUI|5|My wife loves. She has it on her key ring always
B00MEVO5U4|5|Look Great and so far they haven't been stolen so that is always a Plus
B000C9CD6I|4|A month after it was installed still doing good. At times it it seems to not blow as hard but don't know if it's the blower or something else. Was able to track the shipping & got it right away.<br />Super pleased with delivery. Thank You!
B00NPIN8FI|5|Very bright!! Really good for DRL's and lawn mowers...
B00N55JL84|5|GREAT
B000CISLSI|5|Great safety device for the cost.
B0074LQKFC|5|grate
B00E58JM20|4|fit correctly but only came with 1 screw
B00902FVNU|5|The product came in and I installed it soon afterwards. Keep in mind that there is no documentation to the product at all. However, this was a direct replacement to what was there. The only problem is that there is no indication to the wiring pigtails that should match up with what I had in the car. But as my comment has stated, is that the dongle is the same shape and size. I cut off the damaged connector and I spliced into the wire in the same manner that had the connector in the position. What was somewhat deceiving was that the product came with heat-shrink butt splice connectors. I didn't have a heat gun. I tried a hair dryer and it didn't work as well. So I had to run to Harbor Freight to get a cheap one. As soon as I got it all back in the fan assembly and connected, I had to replace the Engine Fan Cooler relay as well; it was melted through. All of these being replaced, I was able to have the fan work agian.
B00LXKYA0C|5|Just received my mirror, fits perfect, just took a second to install. My expectation has been met.  Will purchase another one.
B000FQ7QSS|4|Worked as it should.  No issues.  I needed to make some slight modifications (cutting), but nothing too out of the ordinary.
B004HEF9OM|1|States that it fits a 2008 Chevrolet HHR, however it does not, it is too small. Not able to review product performance.
B00YIKBW8W|4|great product, no squeaking noise, and the price is great
B001H1MBB2|5|Part arrived in new condition and fit perfectly in the car. I will make sure not to use a standard wrench next time and keep this one nice and clean with a 15mm metric socket.
B00S1WDSK8|5|Great lights, and bright too! After a near miss on my motorcycle, a guy pulled out right in front of me and claimed he never saw me, I decided to make myself more visible. These lights certainly did the trick. I attached them to my highway bars with clamps and they brightened up the front of my bike.
B000C2Y0A2|5|Pump is now on the motor and working well.
B00826OVWW|5|i love it
B012MZGKOU|5|It is easy to install in smart phone  and have accurate result
B0013RGQQQ|1|fray after few months
B00GWGAF6A|1|valve core stem is not tempered so it bends to easy and fails. I threw them away because I was afraid to use them.
B00H5A4F22|3|OK, no glare from night drivers coming up behind me on the road or highway.  One of the clips that extends to grasp the mirror did already break however, but the other one still holds it in place.
B001C97ZVA|5|Fit great on my 2007 Ford Edge and saved me a bunch of money by doing it myself.  Lots of videos are online for DIY replacement.
B000P9EP2U|4|excellent
B00FLG0AQM|4|Perfect fit
B00CEXK9TS|5|very happy with vent shades
B000GZL2HE|4|Worked as hoped
B00KWEVZTE|5|Exact replacement filter for my 2014 Mazda 6. I verified that the part number on this filter matches the OEM filter and it did. I will buy again when it comes time to replace it in the future.
B000TYOS3C|5|Works as it should.  Much better than the original part.
B00RW7XO34|5|Great product high quality and look s great
B000C2Y660|5|all good
B007QBT0WA|5|that's it, is what I need,  quality, fast delivery, I love it.
B007ZN88OU|4|The chain came as described. I go to motoshop sf for all my maintenance. They suggest not using a clip chain for 600cc sport bike but the chain seems to be working well. Some stretching has occurred but nothing out of the norm. Fast delivery.
B00FP3668C|1|Looked great when it arrived and looked super on the car. However within 3 months on the car, and maybe 5-7 automated car washes, the black paint finish has started to peel off. Now is an eye sore on my otherwise splendid black Honda Accord. I will not recommend buying this.
B00EN7JOQC|3|The unit came to me with language set to Chinese and no instructions as how to change it. I had to look it up on youtube. It also did not contain my specific model BMW that I bought it for
B00EEEB77I|5|These towels are great for drying pets off after swimming and after heavy rains. They absorb the water unbelievably.  I can wring them out and then continue using them. The towels come in tubes to store them damp. If they dry out completely they harden, but as soon as I wet them again they are fine and ready to absorb more water. They remove more water than an ordinary towel can, and since they can be wrung out and reused, we don't have a lot of wet towels laying around. I would highly recommend them.
B00O0ESM7A|5|Also comes with a Monarch parking decal that I put on my wife's car.
B005OARBLC|5|Great product
B00KTHZW6G|5|Thank You
B000FPYW4K|5|Item works as described. Bought this puller specifically to remove a transmission sprocket seal from a 1980 Harley 4 speed transmission and it worked like a charm. It will definitely be useful for other seal pulling jobs. Good for any professional or do-it-yourself er mechanic to have in the toolbox.
B003IS3HV0|1|Extremely difficult to apply, used it on black BMW leather on the back seats, it's nearly impossible to spread it about.  A year later I can still see where thicker portions of it were applied.  I'm pretty sure this permanently stains and darkens leather.  I usually trust Amazon ratings, but this single product calls that trust into question.
B0085FP5WA|4|Fit perfect on my 02 Silverado and looks good passenger glass gets A little shaky on the highways and you can see the wiring a little bit when looking directly at it
B006GFTZJU|5|Perfect fit, saved me a ton of money with such an easy install
B000BRJVIY|5|Nice incandescent lighting system but uses a lot of power so I went to the LED size
B006QAUIDC|5|Perfect product in perfect condition.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|Shipped on time, looked great and fit well. The reception is horrible and the anodized aluminum is starting to change color and fade.
B0045MYEQ0|5|Very convenient cover. I got this for our trailer that was in storage all summer. This isn't waterproof but if you take care of your trailer, this is well worth the money. I don't neglect my trailer even during times of storage so light clean up would be very beneficial. I love this cover if I weren't storing my trailer for extremely long periods of time.
B00OQP8EX0|5|Good quality no regrets!
B00AHJZBCG|5|So great to have when we're outside at night. We use it when going down to the dock after dark. It's like someone switched on the sun. Awesome. Very happy with this product.
B004MU8VRS|5|PERFECT.... Just as advertised.
B00ACL7YFG|5|Great jersey, very resistent too, survived a big crash first time out, did not rip.
B00DNKLP6C|4|Works perfectly.
B005PZMKZI|5|good car seat covers
B00RA4HOPI|5|great product, super bright, solid construction and wiring
B001FG5V4S|5|Perfect fit 2007 Mazdaspeed3.
B0049ZFVMO|5|I haven't received the part yet, but just had to put out there that I have went through 3 pumps already that I purchased from Advance Auto they have a all been defective I'm one way or another and I have searched on Amazon for some time and saw this one and had to snatch it as fast as possible.  This pump is the most hardest thing to find especially NEW it just doesn't happen ,so I don't care spending $50 more for this one, it has to do the job the right way. This is 2as is always recommended for GM so might as well spend the money and get the official part instead of buying an aftermarket part that is only going to cause problems anyway. This is a brand-new part that shouldn't give any problems at all. Hopefully!!!  Stay tuned for the results I should be installing it this weekend and I am being optimistic that it will work just fine. Fingers crossed.
B00SWUUAK0|4|Excellent product. It worked great for its described purpose; for small cosmetic scratches.
B00J0FCX0Q|3|A little small for the windshield on my 09 Dodge Ram 1500 , but I made it work.
B00H8DFKS4|4|The old lamps were hard to get out but the new ones look great.  The white light makes everything look cleaner and brighter.
B001BK04B8|5|perfect
B00K9Z8G4I|5|Great color and product that matched my car! Had the dealership install them for me.. Now my car is really a show car!
B0095D34YM|5|Easy to install
B00NBUN4OK|5|Truck looks sick - rides good, handles a ton better. Can't beat the price.

B004D0I11S|5|I purchased this start button for a 2009 Altima. It was a very simple install. It consisted of 1) carefully prying the chrome circular piece off. There are two tabs, one is located at the 10-11 o clock position and the other at the 4-5 o clock position for reference. After that 2) Take the brown connector off the original push button. It is one small tab to push off. 3) Push the original button out of the chrome piece by pushing in two black tabs on the button and push from the bottom towards the top out of chrome piece. 4) Reinstall in reverse with the new GTR button. Youtube videos are also out there to help.<br /><br />The button looks much better in person. As others have stated a nice cherry red. The packing indicated an OE Nissan part not that I was concerned it wasn't. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with an applicable Nissan that wants to add a nice touch to their interior.
B00M3X78ZM|1|I wasn't expecting anything when I bought as a joke to bolt it to my friends car, but he didn't even hear a different from inside the car. Its only funny if you can actually hear it.
B006N9574G|5|Fixed all my problems.
B0023091JQ|4|great to hold a 2nd helmet or a small grocery, maybe a day-trip bag
B00GJ1E5ZK|5|This part worked perfectly and at half the price of the original equipment.
B004L307PU|5|Great for any deadliest catch lover :)
B00FN2K1UY|5|Fit well thanks
B00K4C1MLA|4|Bolts rust fairly quickly
B00B93ZXGS|4|Product as described
B002QBNH9W|5|I was having problems with my scooter constantly stalling..this solved the issues..and even made it a little fast few mph nothing crazy..lol..but hey every little bit helps
B00KQV12JQ|5|awesome
B00HXHJB3A|5|Came in a timely fashion. Very happy with this product.
B004NDBYQ4|5|Worked miracle on 1991 Miata that was red but chalky. Brought paint back.
B004FJPS5Y|5|Exactly as advertised
B000WJX4BQ|5|This is the battery you want.  I had a fully sealed one before this and it didn't last as long as these do.  It takes more effort on the front end with the acid and initial charging, but it's worth it.
B00KWGQO3Y|5|It works very well
B00LR4G980|5|Awesome Tag !
B009EAAWUU|4|these are working great for my f250 super duty (2006).  have to watch the assembly of the shells though, you can easily bend one of the tabs used to hold it on
B008G1XL2E|5|New, just waiting to fix vehicle to put on. Thanks
B00VCUM4QU|4|Very nice will not work on trucks
B005FKS5BG|5|Excellent fitment, high quality, all the hardware
B008XB9BJY|5|Awesome purchase.  Great warm natural light.  Replaced the dinning area halogens in my RV.
B006WQSD1O|1|I just installed 2 new wheel/hub bearings on my 2000 Bonneville.Originals lasted 15 years and 150k miles..The Detroit Axle hubs have lasted 212 miles,allready bad.And yes they were installed correctly.TOTAL CRAP,do not buy,its not worth the money you will save when you have to do it again,and its not like I can run to the Amazon store down the street and get a new one
B00KTIY4ZA|1|Won't program and company says car doesnt have keyless entry. ..funny I bought it new with keyless entry. .I wonder where it went
B0064P14HI|2|They cannot be tightened and they continue to come lose. I have even taken them to the jeep dealer and they said  they are as tight as they go, recommended some lock tight and then they would only be lined up for one driver.
B0000AZ8FX|5|what i wanted.happy.
B001O0VNT2|5|the pads are quiet, direct fit for my 2002 toyota celica gts.
B006QUOIPQ|4|only problem after one week the paint started to chip from the wire mesh .i contacted the company they told me no guarantee if you already installed it . guess i should have left it in the box what a ridiculous policy
B000EPYMZK|5|Good part
B007SG7X9A|1|Poor quality, when car interior warms up the handle feels all sticky. Face has faded, and chrome ring almost worn off by 6 months.
B00U5WL0V6|1|Tried many times to talk to the company, worse product and company to deal with in my life.
B002WBZSPM|5|It fit our boat perfectly.
B007Y86TIS|5|The only trouble I had was getting the old starter off. There are two bolts that hold the starter in place. The higher one is difficult to get to, and the bolt head was slightly rounded off on mine which made it even more fun. Thank goodness for YouTube. There is a short video that perfectly demonstrates what you need to do. Search &#34;Cherokee starter replacement&#34;
B005ASY23I|5|Great item, fills all  4  35&#34; tires from 20 lbs to 35 lbs in under 17 minutes, pretty good for a portable unit at under 65 bucks
B00IO993CU|5|Good deal. Car stops well, no squealing from the brake pads.
B000BZ51ZS|5|This was the second one of these that I installed on my 2005 Scion XB and so far they've worked great.  The first time I found out I needed a new one was from the Toyota dealership and they wanted to charge $900 for parts and labor.  There was no way I was going to pay that so I found that these had good reviews online and ordered.  Took less than an hour to install after watching a video online and they are really quiet.
B00EKTJE1S|5|Easy to install looks great
B00XV8V0E8|5|Works great fits just like the original ones can't tell the difference
B00AFV7DHW|5|Awesome product--- fits great
B00URR4O5I|5|Bought Noica for installation on the door of my Ford Focus. This is not my first soundproofing car project,before that I used Dynamat and Fatmat. Overall I satisfied with Noica. Material sticky, with a thickness of - 50 mil. Not to say that this is the best stuff I've ever seen , but for the money it is a very good bargin.<br />I liked - the material does not has asphalt smell<br />(Fatmat smell asphalt). Well, the price is more than two times lower than Dynamat. Easy to cut and install, especially if a little lied on the sun. I wanted to stick to the roof. Prior to that, specifically an experiment - a small piece stuck on the iron table and placed in the sun for the whole day. The material does not fall off, but remained in place. I liked that the material is quite heavy (you feel that really stick sound deadening material, not polyethylene layer of glue). Well, their new feature embossed design- actually turned out to be useful. It is convenient to work - you can see where the roll touched the material.<br />I did not like - the material is sold in sheets. On the one hand it is good - the material comes smooth, beautiful, no dents, as well as convenient to make a pattern and cut it. But I was left with 2 sheets in the box and I needed to keep them flat in the box on the shelf (it is still large, and in the garage is not as much space). Didn’t wanted to fold but  rolling was better choice and much easier to store. But to use material on a roll - is not as good as the sheets. So I will buy another pack to finish my project. I wanted to finish it ASAP and probably will do next weekend.<br /><br />Of course, Dynamat is better material, but now I'm not ready to give up so much money for it. Noico overall is a good alternative and better price.<br /><br />By finishing with doors, I already see the result and I hope when the project is fully completed - it will be much better!<br /><br />Service – it was sent on time, I had few questions -they responded within 1 day,and the installation instruction was sent to me by e-mail how to work with their material.<br />Nicely done.
B00558T4P4|5|Original equipment  fits perfect
B00332GNZI|5|Good looking bed rail caps, Have been on for a while now, still look good and are holding down nicely.
B00IBO6K2O|5|I don't see how microfiber towels can be any better than these. Super plush, and I love how it's divided into quarters.
B007LICL56|5|Works great with plate covers
B007Q4MOGG|5|The part fits our new 2015 Mazda 5 and the vendor provided an excellent price. Came in on time and in the original packaging. Couldn't be happier.
B004K80I9G|5|Hey - Have an S60R or V70R? These are great replacements for the factory active suspension.  Make sure you do a SUM calibration! Ride is so much better after replacing the worn out shocks and these are at a price where you can save more than half off the OEMs!
B004SVFP8E|5|This tonneau cover fits very nicely and was not difficult to install (RTFM).  I really like the way it rolls up neatly, it's much easier to corral than the Extang I had years ago.  The mechanism for locking the cover down is excellent.
B000JZYVB0|3|not a direct replacement for factory exhaust. oem pipe is 2&#34; od these are 1 7/8 ID.  i had to sawzall the inlet down to like an inch left then go to parts store and get 2 - 1 7/8 od to 2 id adapters and mig weld them into the mufflers. you will need to shorten the inlet to clear the opening and rear hangers.  they fit over factory pipe then. outlets worked fine with factory aluminum tips though. other than that it works on my 2001 grand prix gt
B000EDOT7I|5|Good!!!
B00E5PXY8G|1|Received new in package as expected, but after a week of installing the high beam started overheating by staying on all the time.<br />Had to disable the high beam and driving with low beam.<br />Not very happy about that.
B008BYRGCC|5|WOW!  I've put this pulley on two Vulcan 900's now.  It's crazy how much it improves the performance of the bike.  It's smoother, faster, longer gears.  Gears kind of match those in cars.  You can go 1st through 4th and almost use 5th gear as an overdrive.
B008JORKP2|5|Works wonderfully
B00D7YF4NY|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado.
B0008F68MG|5|Works great.
B00KPWBDZY|3|Bought the side steps, got them in the mail, went to mount them on and there has to be some washers missing or something else. They didn't mount properly onto my 14 wrangler sport. I still have them on though because they seem to be pretty solid. Might have to buy a few washers myself.
B00MU5X17M|5|Fits perfect on my 2011 Silverado!!!
B000HACYNY|5|This works great!
B00E5PK8TE|5|Outstanding!
B005J1UK2I|5|Finally got to mount them on camper, look like they will work fine
B001AXGT7O|5|Great price and fit
B00JAO5LCE|5|helmet is great very clear shield best price on the internet very positive lockup on the face.
B000W1XX4M|5|worked great
B00N0IHMXM|5|my wife thanks me, beats the old hand crank
B0089KGY9O|5|great
B000HRF2SQ|5|Item received on time in new condition. Fit was perfect, very easy installation.
B005U7ZXDC|1|It doesn't fit the Kymco People 150, at least not the 2009 model. Almost an inch too long.
B00FWOKKGI|5|Great light  , fit great were I want it to go .
B00H1IBKIK|5|all good
B002GISKFQ|4|Good product!
B0048J6T4K|3|bought this product in October 2013 and it lasted until august of 2015
B00KNNP6Q2|5|Could not be happier with this product.. Dealer wanted $150 plus to replace.
B0033DOKLQ|5|fast service and great price
B00NE33KES|5|Works like new
B003BZO05C|5|works great keeps my bling bike pretty
B00PGH5U6Q|5|Love this key protector for my new car.  Fits great, feels great, and looks great.
B00688WF6A|5|Works great. Fast shipping.
B00KTJ5LBK|5|I am so happy to have these! Programming was easy and they work just like they're supposed to.<br /><br />The plastic feels a little lighter, but not enough to make a significant difference, in my opinion. My one word of caution would be that the buttons don't always pop back like they're supposed to. It seems they can get caught under the plastic that surrounds them. However, if you wiggle the button the tiniest bit, it pops right back into place. This does not affect the function, and for all I know it may not make a difference at all. I only worry if the button doesn't pop back, that it could still be powering the signal, and could therefore drain the battery. But I have to say, this is just my worry, it's not based on experience or knowledge.<br /><br />Regardless, $17 for two remote fobs (when a dealer will charge you $80 for one) is amazing. If you find yourself in need of a replacement, I can't recommend this option highly enough.
B000CB94JU|5|Works Great!
B00GIZIT3Q|5|Beautiful and was exactly what was advertised.<br />Will buy from this vender again.<br />Quick on delivery as well.
B00MOR4D5U|5|Awesome lights. Replaced hids in a 2009 Denali. Super bright and I like that they have low beams and high beams.
B0026HKVSG|5|Great purchase
B006BURZQ0|1|these are complete garbage... ended up putting the factory lights back in the car.
B00PY2B8EG|5|Fast shipping, great quality, color match was perfect, install was fairly easy, look great.  While I am still stinging from the price of these flares ultimately I am glad I sprung for them, they look awesome.
B002XM39M4|1|Poorly made, key can only be removed in locked position. This is a problem if you use 2 on each door of the RV. Key does not operate smoothly hangs up while locking or unlocking. Look for another locking set save you money look for another lock set
B00GOJ91G0|5|Love this jacket. Bought it in the store and online for my friend. If you have shoulders, get the XL since it has the armour in it and you want to be able to bend your arms at the natural break.
B00FPWF2W4|5|Fast delivery, works amazing! It decreases the buffeting. I wish it had some plugs to finish the area for the inserts.
B00I1BTCB8|4|After 500 miles it's held well, but the only issue is when I received it one of the pegs was not cut properly, it was the right length and size but unlike the other peg on the same piece, it had not been ground down far enough for the link to be properly attached, and I had to carefully use some sandpaper to file the metal down far enough to fit the clip on before installing.<br /><br />Otherwise, it has been a perfectly good product and I'm glad I found it, the clip type link is much easier than the rivet type that most chains come with.
B006LO6EJA|5|Best battery I've ever owned. Better than Yuasa by a landslide...
B001DCN1SC|4|The clips on the new ones gave us some trouble. It was a struggle (that hatch is VERY heavy; we did not have a ladder to prop open so three small people had to hold it up) but after some maniupulation and use of and old clip, my husband was able to get both lifts in. They work great. Wish we had changed them sooner; my daughters hatch on her vue is starting to act up so now we know where to get her new ones. Hope her lift clips do not give us as much trouble.
B001JT0CGI|5|good price. promptly received..
B000HDDIF4|5|Excelente seller
B009IMSNKK|5|Best pants on the market, one more added to the four I already have. Too bad JT has discontinued this great product.
B000EDUUHQ|3|The only place they will fit is in the bathroom cabinet. If you need cupboard bars get the longer sizes.
B00B1G9788|1|I needed new car seat covers after the ones I had were worn out. I considered ordering off of Amazon because of their competitive prices and variety. After looking through many listings and different types of car seat covers I chose this one for my car. I regret buying them. The installation process was bad even after watching  the video. Before ordering i entered in my car make and model. The listing said my car was compatible but the covers required removing the entire bench seating to install. My bench seating is not removable. Securing the covers was equally bad because it required straps and hooks that attach to any part of the seat that it can hook onto. Not even a specific area. I put the covers onto my two front seats. I also put the cover onto my middle row bench seating. They are a disaster. The middle row bench seating is so loose fitting and the configuration is crazy. You have to cut holes in the covers for the headrests. While getting in and out of the car the covers move with you and slide around. The seat covers I had previously were from my local automotive store and we're very tight fitted and worked out well. Now I have to go buy those again. I tried to save money here and it goes to the saying you get what you pay for.
B001OMVCN2|3|Works great, constantly comes on or bleeds off air with temperature change. Be prepared to hear you vehicle making noise every hour or so, either inflating or deflating trying to keep a constant pressure. I love the system
B002J8UPO2|5|Love it.
B000S2IWIC|4|Direct fit, works really well.
B00HBIL6DY|5|very nice
B00COC8QCQ|5|These things look great, haven't put any miles on them but they fit very well during install.
B00EFDVVV0|5|Happy
B00BSZDXFK|2|One quart of oil was open
B00U2UZC2O|5|These things dont move until you pull them off & also leave no residue.
B00VBODVPA|1|It is very hard to tell, but these do NOT say Harley Davidson.  The are constructed well; however, they are not HD mirrors and this listing is a bit deceiving.
B00RW7X0E2|5|Looks cheap in person but they work very well, that's what matters.
B00F2VB1TQ|4|The product functions as described. However, the finish work on the item is less than desirable. The backing is a cream colored material with white thread for the finishing stitching. Looks hokey against the 'onyx' wool. Black thread would give the item a more professional appearance. Alas, made in China 😞
B00IA2QVNU|5|I love detailing my cars and use this product on all of them. In the spring I'll clay, clean and polish the paint, then apply the Paint Coating. It goes on easy and wipes off to a glossy shine that protects your paint all year long. I've purchased this product twice and will continue to use it.
B001V8U12M|5|Works fine
B00HTOB0NG|5|Got this with my HID Kit from them (6000k 35w) and made everything work like a dream.
B0082365AQ|5|This works great, exactly what I needed.  I walk 1/2 mile to the lake, the first 1/4 on payment, and the second 1/4 on a semi-rough trail.  This is the ticket to transporting your kayak.  The price was right on this version, I don't know what could be different on the ones costing 2 or 3 times as much.  But be warned, there are no instructions at all.  Simply the pieces in cardboard shipping box, no &#34;product&#34; box.  The tires came very under inflated, so you will need to take them and have them inflated before using.  As everyone else notes, the tires do smell, but the smell on mine went away quickly. (The box retained the smell worse than the tires did, so discard it quickly.)<br /><br />I wasn't even sure what should be the front or back.  I tried to look at pictures on-line of people using similar ones, and it looks like people use them both ways.  After reading suggestions, I ended up putting the legs in front, so they will fold backwards.  As far as connecting the kayak using the strap, As someone else pointed out, the easiest way to strap the kayak on is to start by setting the kayak on the cart, lay the strap across the top of the kayak with the end hanging down on both sides, run each end through the tube/side of the cart underneath, and then bring both sides of the strap back on top and fasten the clip on top of the kayak.  Once fastened tightly, I have had no problems with my kayak falling off, even on fairly rough terrain.  However, if I pick up the back end of the kayak, the wheels/cart will collapse down, so be careful there.<br /><br />Also to make pulling it easier, put the kayak on the cart about where the seat is, or just a little ways back of the center of gravity.  It will work fine if you put it towards the back of the kayak, but you will end up supporting more of the weight when you pull it.  Ideally, you want the cart to support most of all the weight, with you supplying the forward motion.<br /><br />I also tried one of the kayak/SUP over-the-shoulder straps, and that didn't work well at all.  The cart works really well. Highly recommended if you have to carry your kayak any distance at all.er-the-shoulder straps, and that didn't work well at all.  The cart works really well. Highly recommended if you have to carry your kayak any distance at all.
B004HCOE8Q|5|Worked
B000C55YN6|5|PERFECT
B00LXK08V2|4|i just got them and they fit perfectly the only problem was there was a little sticker on the package that says its only use for  car show/ off- road and it is not dot approved. however it it looked as if someone was trying to take it off when i received it. can i use this as a daily driver? is this DOT approved?
B000VLD6X6|3|The cart works, but it is tricky to put the doors in (two upside down), and take back out. The racks are not anchored so you either need to modify the kit or risk losing your other pieces when removing one. It is not &#34;convenient&#34; but does the job if you want to save time from building one yourself. Still, expect modifications - quality leaves something to be desired.
B00QAMKNYK|2|Door removal attachment is too small
B001EWG4VC|5|Purchased these as a gift look exactly like picture boyfriend loved them :) good description and quality
B0015DU8O4|5|Having been on the wrench side of things for almost fifteen years, I've done my fair share of horrible brake line jobs.  Trying to source out just the right fitting for that 88 Subaru, or having to rebuild an entire braking system on 91 Mazda pickup.  This kit has almost everything you could possibly need! Besides tools, of course.  The fittings are of a very high quality, and seal up nicely.  The real star of the show is the line itself though.  You can wrap it in a coil on your little finger with one hand and no kinks!  But yet it retains its strength!  I've also had these lines on my van in northern Iowa for nearly six years and they show zero signs of corrosion.  That's a big one.  Oh and it flares like butter!<br /><br />All in all, the best brake line replacement material I've ever used. Hands down.
B003UIPN7E|5|Excellent price and product.
B000C5GAQQ|4|its a gas cap, so do i really need to say TOO much.  But it was under $7, it works on my car as it should, and it seems to be well made.  I give it a thumbs up!
B00LOYCIXI|5|Works great
B007Q4T5WM|5|Great price. The headlights look great!!!! Thanks.
B001NAP2AY|5|As stated
B001CEG90I|4|great
B008P73LAQ|5|Love, love, love this shirt!! perfect fit!
B00SRZ54PQ|5|Thanks
B00R974C2E|5|Economic and fast.
B0009V1WS4|1|This doesn't fit the Sportrack 2901 as bundled by Amazon. Lock is fine but not threaded so it doesn't fit the rack. Amazon shouldn't bundle with the rack.
B00RV83UUG|5|Great deal.  Its very bright and was easy to install.  You don't really need to purchase the wiring harness but I did.  It came with a lighted rocker switch and provided extra protection with a relay and fuse in line.
B00XP79T34|4|Simple to install headlight, very straight forward. Does not come with mounting bolts though.
B005SEJTYG|5|Great stuff! Car runs much better now!
B0077S1BBU|4|Perfectly easy to install
B00WFFXP78|5|They work perfect. No problems yet. Car is running like a champ. 2002 chrysler 300m.
B004MQWMWC|5|Love my duffle! Fits nicely, looks great and holds all my stuff!
B001OD0VPG|5|Work great. Good pressure, easy to attach.
B00F5MU9MW|5|Great pressure. Very futuristic looking. Larger than anticipated, but great nonetheless. Easy install, love the &#34;trickle button&#34;.
B00OYEKX5K|5|Exelent. Thanks you Amazon.com
B002PUTC0M|5|great digital air chuck!! i use it everyday at work, hasn't failed me once.
B006N95UMK|5|Excellent Product, good quality and fit it.  I think that is the same quality than oem part.
B003YMX0O4|5|perfect fit
B000CGFHBY|5|Did its job
B0053ZQ6LY|4|Bueno
B00T47KG9A|1|DIFFERENT SIZE
B002W21TMW|3|Not bad quality, installed easily and the wiring is solid. Did notice my clear led lens separated a bit from the black aluminum housing - otherwise sufficient brightness and decent quality.
B004GC9KBS|4|Excellent
B004Y9YIU6|4|Great haven't install yet but my brother orderd the same & stated there great thanks can't wait to install mine
B00KWGJGFW|5|Replaced after and oil leak. Installed works perfectly
B0001EXVF6|5|Love it, thanks!
B0054FJEDK|4|very inexpensive and seems to work just fine
B0037NSFB8|5|They seem to attach well to my Tourmaster motorcycle pants.  Since I haven't had to slide across pavement while using them I can't speak to their performance.
B00KTHV36E|5|Did not have an original to program it as the paperwork recommends but took it to the dealership and they program it for 11 dollars...
B005KDOAGC|1|They are junk<br />Hey are worst they my stock bulbs<br />I wasted my money on these bulbs.
B000UOE1XS|5|Exact fit in '02 Chevy Venture.
B0009N4F72|5|Fit my old/mid school Diamond Back Assault bmx as promised, very pleased with purchase
B00GUGXYME|5|Works well for my speed density tune in a boosted  LS2.
B00OAC1NKU|1|The brackets did not fit they are flimsy so either make your own or buy better because these only fit a handful of bikes.  As for the instructions there are none but you should be able to figure out take off your seat and use the bolts to your fender to secure your saddlebags
B00W5YSWWW|5|Got this for my boyfriends birthday and he loved it. I thought it was a whole seat I order and it was just the cover for the seat I guess I didn't read it correctly.
B00MPQ3CZ2|5|This is the second item that I have purchased from Titan & there equipment is top quality.
B008GACRUM|5|It was what I needed
B009B42FR2|5|Very Nice!  Car feels like new after replacing this and many other
B000X3IVV4|5|Fantastic on the allroad!
B0073WEZU4|4|You will miss a few channels but it looks great.
B00BIO1JK2|3|Would like to Corrections Officer, listed on it.
B008032QSI|5|fit perfect
B00701EIRS|5|This seat belt extender makes my life so much easier.
B000VL6AHU|5|High Quality<br />Fit perfectly<br />No problems<br />Worked like a charm
B000CEBX5A|5|Easy to install. Worked well at freeway speed. Easy to store and redeploy.
B007A997Z8|4|I am 5'8 165.  I ordered the medium.  They fit just right over my jeans.  I haven't tried them out yet but they seem like they will be very warm and do the trick.
B004IYT0D2|2|The part appears to be of good quality but the fuel cap doesn't fit. A fix for the fuel cap problem is to remove half of the threads in the filler neck with a Dremel tool. This is definitely a plan &#34;B&#34; part like the other reviews state but in the vehicle it fits quiet well.
B0002TDUW4|4|I think this is an awesome product, I was very happy w it so happy that after I did my truck bed I did the sides of my truck (over the fenders bottom of doors ect.) and what I found out is that this stuff drys to a rubbery type texter for example I thought it would aventually crack or chip but it can't because it's flexible when it dries, also considering the price of the stuff $90 for a full gallon, 2 rollers, cuff pad and brush, well worth the money. And just some tip from my experience I recommend stirring the herculiner quit often u will find that the thinker stuff will settle to the bottom as ur applying it, I would say litterally every 5-10 minutes take 10 seconds to stir it, and be carefull if u apply too much in one area and don't brush it in well enough it will drip so make sure u wait a good 10 minutes or so to make sure it won't drip
B000G72UOQ|4|I wish these were NYLON and not MYLAR!  Other than that, they are great!
B000C5SGAO|5|Perfect fit on my 95 4Runner.<br />Denso by the way, is OEM equipment on most Jap vehicles.
B000C7S5K8|5|So far, so good. My truck is running a lot cooler with new fluid and this radiator. I recommend you read up on flushing while changing radiators, with drain cracked open and heater running, etc.
B0068C8OW0|4|My mistake- Should have ordered Large
B005CD4MQS|5|I love my little smiley face sun. It is cute and now I can find my car in the parking lot more easily. It was on time and just what I wanted.
B000B6H1T6|5|Cool zebra plates
B0012ZEZ8A|5|Been using Meguiar's stuff forever. Never disappointed. Phenomenal price.
B000G72UOQ|5|Good product recommended
B00PVXRFWW|4|Didn't realize it is only two wires in a three wire prong. My bad, but still disappointed. Now will have to buy pins for the third wire.
B00HTWJBAW|5|Very good
B0006IX7UQ|5|works great in a mini fridge and stack well with other types
B00JUKLG1I|1|Did not  fit right
B00DRYOOIA|5|Great product. I could definitely tell the difference once I installed it. Took awhile to install but I was also installing a 2.5 inch level. 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9L QDCB SLT 4x4
B000HS4QA0|4|Looks great.  Works great
B00MY525KW|5|Great kit.  The hardware is well made and the pads are quiet after install.  The kit comes with a small rag and grease for the caliper guide pins.  As these are a rear application it is hard to distinguish any braking improvement over OEM.  Time will tell what longevity is like.  I'm happy with the purchase so far.
B00H1ES6S6|5|Lights work great
B00L2YUR7E|1|They were not the  that sharp edges all over it
B00I8OK7X0|5|Easiest hitch I've ever installed.  Took me about an hour.  Really good fit between the bolt patterns on the van and the hitch.  This comes with the wires to sneak the bolt through the hitch tube.  Curt has done a great job with this hitch.  Only thing that I found interesting was that the holes in the hitch for the carriage bolt were round and not square so the bolts spun when I tried to tighten them.  I just applied pressure on them with a bar inside the tube and everything was good.  As reasonably priced as this thing was I can't complain though.  Looks Great Too
B0007N3JNU|5|It works great!
B005NLQAHS|5|Been using this for about a year now and it works really well with the torque pro app. Has held up good and no malfunctions. Seems to be fairly accurate or at least can give you good baseline numbers for comparison. I've used it on at least 5 different vehicles with no issues, and it has pulled codes on each vehicle no problem. Also works will with forscan program for abs code reading! A definite must have any mechanic!
B0010HI3YW|5|EXCELLENT
B00B8X7RY0|5|It was exact fit for 2001 Wrangler Sport.
B0013FGPTQ|5|Was a direct replacement worked great glad to get my interior light back working
B0063OQTH0|4|They fit and do the job. What more can you ask for.
B000CQVKSS|1|Not for a 76 Jeep CJ7.
B000CMFPJ2|5|Works as advertised.
B009UHKOEG|5|PROUDLY MADE IN USA!!!!  Very good quality bell.  Wife bought it for me before an iron butt ride.  Nasty road gremlins were gone the night before the ride.  Have it purchased for you as a gift for double good luck.
B003BZD03K|5|Works Great.
B00KTHYFDW|5|Love them they work perfectly.
B00Z093MFQ|1|the coils did not work, mecanic put them in and still did not work, as he took one out it broke apart and said the parts were not good and tge other half was stuck inside and came out in pieces. would not recemmend this.
B0002SR7TC|5|Impressed; used the extractor for my Mercedes GL 450 oil change recently, and it sucked out virtually every drop of engine oil in the engine.<br />I strongly recommend this product and will encourage DIY car enthusiast to give it a try.
B00HAPHVAA|1|i received broken and Made in Chaina! i aas shocked!!
B0074EJ5DI|1|Snapped in half when trying to put it on a F150.  Amazon said it was a fit for my car but was not really even close.  Some reviews said you had to work at it but that it would fit, however, &#34;working at it&#34; broke it...Not worth the money.
B00BFDJ9QM|5|Good fit and quality.  Good stuff!<br />Shadow
B0011LGONO|3|I love the look and feel of them, but installation was unnecessarily difficult. The clearance for installing the nuts was so tight I needed to use a series of wedges and an excessive amount of time. These should install in minutes with one person, but look about two frustrating hours with two people. Once you have them on they feel like part of the Jeep and look great, but there is no excuse for the difficulty in installation. If you are patient by all means get them they are awesome once on. The reason for 3 starts is for hassle of install and I did have some finish worn off due to the factory packing and shipping where the two rails rubbed against each other.
B001UCBJN4|1|Purchased this item as brand new....but after installing it.....I found that the pully is a little sloppy causing a similar vibration noise common to failing tensioner's. Now I need to purchase a NEW pully/bearing assembly to install again.<br />I'm not pleased that I wasted $80 on this unit. I could have probably spent $80 at Honda and simply replaced the pully part and been better off.<br />Fortunately, I didn't waste money having it installed by my normal shop....this is a simple two bolt process that anyone with mechanical proficiency can pull off.<br />You may be better served paying a bit more and getting this part thru Honda Motors.
B00TDOH53E|4|Like the variety but some of the names are a bit hard to market.  Being a business owner names like &#34;stripper scent&#34; are not good for business when placed on flyers or literature that is sent to possible clients. All the other scents are good and I like the small samples in the kit as a way to offer a variety and decide which ones I would order in the larger bottles.
B000OP3H6K|5|Nice heavy mat
B001CO699Y|5|Lovely noise, excellent fuel economy
B003XWEO8Q|5|Work and look great.. I used them to replace similar grips on my 04 Honda VTX1300C.  I did opt to remove the throttle sleeve which was a huge pain in the ass, but it saved me some effort of dealing with the throttle cables.  Product looks great and is super comfortable to hang on to.  Seems to dampen vibrations pretty well too.  I would buy these again.
B0031BUDSO|5|I took this bag on a 10 day tour on a Harley Ultra Classic. This was a very convenient addition to the saddle bags and tour pack space.
B00P6OPHK8|5|Good
B00O5MVIXM|1|Cheep
B00G620ZVU|5|Perfect
B000IYY7S4|4|The only issue was the paint on the ears.. Caused the pads to bind and not be free i simply used a file to remove the paint and the issue was fixed
B00HVSCOSU|5|Great product color matched was very happy
B007F845KG|5|Great
B001AM8K1I|5|I needed just a tiny bit of help for load leveling on my 1995 Chevy C2500 when travelling longer distances with my 24' race hauler attached or 1500# in the bed.  Even with a weight distributing hitch correctly adjusted I had a bit of rear squat.  My options were air bags, helper springs or this.<br /><br />With and 8000# trailer with a about 900# tongue weight going from the (minimum) 25 PSI to 80 PSI solves the squat with only a minor degradation in ride.  With the truck empty, the 25 PSI does degrade the ride a decent amount but the rear is more controlled than the worn, rusted and who knows how old OEM style shocks.
B00H1I639Q|5|Outstanding lug nuts, exceeded all my expectations! Threaded on better than my OEM caps. Outstanding finish to them and not capped like my OEM lug nuts.
B00ZE5RGTY|3|Smooth outer surface allows catch all to fall deep. Seller sends follow up email with brief PDF indicating if they fall deep, it'll still catch stuff. I have some emergency blankets I used to prop them in place, works until someone moves the seat. Saving stars are the sticky mat is unique.
B000QR6XJ4|5|Smells yummy. Eliminates man odor in the bathroom.
B000EDUUH6|4|I have two boxers and they love looking out the screen of our RV.  So I purchased this to protect the screen and keep them inside in case of a little critter going past the door.  Installation was super easy and it has done exactly what I needed and wanted it to do.  Love it.
B000CMKESO|5|Perfect fit on the specific application (f150 in my case). prevents road grime and rocks from hitting the vehicle. Looks OEM and very sturdy mounting.
B00O7NBVQ8|5|Works as expected, I'm happy with the product overall. I will update my review should that change.
B00D01V5KA|5|It looks great!
B007IVQYNG|5|No problems.
B000BQWLE6|3|Make sure you read the dimensions...I laughed when I received this because it is so small. Using it for the car instead of the camper.
B000143LHY|5|Absolutely  the best product for instantly illiminating smoke extremely fast, with fresh scent
B003VDX5D2|3|This is a great idea I got from a friend of mine.  The plastic buckles used to hold the ladder down while traveling are junk. They broke with the first pull.  The D ring and Velcro strap used on earlier model was the greatest.  That is what my buddy has and I wish I had
B00Q3CM2QY|5|Just the tip of the iceberg for usage.  Have restored one 12 volt auto - battery would not hold charge.  Took 3 days.to desulfate and charge.  Let vehicle sit for 1 month, and then started like a new battery.  I'm very impressed!!
B00407FUU4|5|Very satisfied with the product and quick shipping. Thank You.
B00GSMSOK2|5|We're good product👍👍👍
B00F4PL2GM|2|These gloves are terrible. Just two weeks after I started using them the leather fell apart between the fingers.
B001NHCFVQ|4|Fit on my Ranger well. I haven't used it yet, so a review seems premature. I do have a feeling it will be fine and do what I expected.
B001FCBAII|5|Works great in my Jayco RV. So much better than a regular shower curtain. Great purchase at a great price.
B00GXXCP24|2|Small, thin... ok for the price, but definately use once and throw out product.
B000IXSQF0|5|Stock C6 Corvette filter. Does filter stuff.
B00K9ZZXYY|2|Sturdy
B001CI6TWM|5|Always  great product.
B0036QZ8VQ|4|These support stands works great the only issue I had which is a small issue  is that the rear stand was a little enclose so I had to physically pull it open so my 2005 honda cbr600rr sits perfect when I jack it up
B000I04Z7Q|4|Made my interior look good. Love it. Must try to love it too.
B00CKINJ8A|3|Really close to OEM. Had to sand it in several places to make it fit.
B00AF5YM90|5|I've been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Great product! Love it.
B011C7BHXI|5|it works great
B00522WQYO|5|Fit perfect for a 2005 Jeep Wrangler!
B004L1ZBLM|5|Brakes feel great after switching to these pads!
B003LUPH2M|1|Both bulbs Burned out in 1 month
B00PVM6ZA6|5|Love it! Exactly what I was looking for
B00CS9CO6Y|5|Drove through heavy rain for 8 hours on a 10 hour drive. Did GREAT!  I had it on a 2004 Toyota Camry without a roof rack. I recommend connecting the straps inside of the car. I would definitely recommend.
B000ALG86E|4|Replaced a different brand cover that fell apart in a year. This is being used outside in direct sunlight. Arrived quickly and fits my 89 LX hatchback Mustang perfectly. We'll see how it holds up!
B00388NNMS|5|Good price for an excellent gas filter.
B00Q3CP2JS|5|They  looked exactly like they are show. Love them both looks great.
B0094WWDQ4|1|One star because it is not 60 mm. It is much smaller, exactly 44.5 mm! Now, I can not use it.
B00A0GIJHA|5|Still have s slight smell when I turn on my AC for the first 10 seconds. Was hoping this would make a difference. Either way its an Aid file and it fits perfectly.
B000GUWRSW|5|The fastest shipping I've had on Amazon!!!! Great job!
B00D2CU55S|5|This was a near perfect fit for the replacement light I couldn't find.  This is much brighter and beater than the original!
B000N5JREM|4|I recently purchased this exhaust for my 2006 IS350.  The installation was fairly straightforward.  My initial impression was that it gives the car a nice deep throaty sound.  The sound isn't very loud.  At idle it similar to stock.  When you punch it, it comes to life.  However, the part I am very very concerned about is the drone right around the 1800 to 2200 RPM range.  That is the cruising range so any drone at that RPM range is annoying.  I could even hear it over my music.  If this keeps up, I will likely take the exhaust off.<br /><br />I'm surprised that Tanabe or other exhaust manufactures for that matter, don't add materials to reduce exhaust pipe resonance.  The stock exhaust has rubber attachment which seems to be for this purpose.
B004GDIIBA|2|It's all plastic the first one I brought broke so had to buy another to replace it. I don't blame the vendor, they only produce junk today and sell it like it was gold. Think the term they use is planned obsolescence!, what a plan!
B00OPXADOG|3|Looks really nice on my car and nice itself. The only problem is that it is not sticking right. I placed it on my car after cleaning the spot where I wanted with alcohol. Between medal decal and foam like stuff  peels up. I don't know if it got bent or not but I had to super clue it back to the foam part. So make sure you look at it first or try taking the double sided sticky foam of and use 3m double sticky tape
B00SDMJLQ6|4|Check your clearance.  I purchased this for 2 uses - it will not work for one due to the extender's rigidity and the clearance available on our seat.  On another note, it is fine for the back seat truck seat belts that are difficult to reach.
B0000AZ9KS|4|No more moving material in side the PU truck box anymore and that ratchet extending & release mechanism is great along with the pressure distributing  swiveling rubber covered end pads
B00PMAXZA0|1|Painted not anodized. Paint chipped first time I tightened them. Looks like crap. Why would you put a finish on a product that won't hold up to normal installation?!?!?!
B00LNE04NA|4|I would buy it again.
B003YLMQHC|5|Quick and easy install. Cut a few wires and crimp them together with the supplied connectors
B000CMF31M|5|These work Great, price is on par with other straps.
B00L3KLIQ6|5|These were exactly like the manufactures keys. Worked perfectly when programed to my car.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|5|Very Nice
B006NYI19Y|1|Amazon.com says that it fits 07 Civic but it doesnt. The holes dont line-up correctly and you need to drill new holes. I returned it and went with rockauto.com
B00U0UWQ2A|5|NIce
B00S15PLF0|5|perfect and no noise
B00EOBDDNW|4|Okay for the price
B004IARSEY|5|good
B000BUOSGG|5|fits perfect in camper sink
B00768RHFK|1|failed immediately.
B00N6DBXG8|5|very bright, used in bmw for fogs amazing
B00005OWK2|4|safety you hope not to need, small, easy to include , silly not to own and carry
B001KZJ85M|4|Pump works but it is extremely noisier compared to OEM pump not sure i like that but still give it 4 out of 5 stars
B00062YUUS|5|This meter is a great addition to my garage. The meter functions are easy to use and proved useful for tuning my son's 71 LeMans. Great tool for the price.
B00852684M|5|these worked great !
B00HLK77YO|3|Does the job I guess. Great video instructions, Easy install. Seems to work as it should. But very cheaply made. Plastic plastic plastic. Looks good in he box, but as soon as I touched it i was very disappointed. So long term durability is up in the air. This could have been a great product, but the company made the cheapest thing they could get away with. To bad. Would I buy again? Probably not. But that being said it fills a need, and seems to work as advertised. And Customer service seems good . So I would say if you need it , buy it, and if your not sure and quality matters to you , maybe not.
B00M7RERPS|5|Hubby ordered this for his laptop. He does have to lean his chair back a little, but he thinks it works well.
B00SNCYQL6|4|I'll start off by saying I have a large and somewhat odd shaped melon when it comes to helmets so it's very hard to find one that fits. I already have a full face helmet and had to buy a $600 Shoei to have one that fit right.<br />When I received this helmet it was too small in the forehead and back of the head, I couldn't wear it. However, I was able to get through the fabric liner, there are two slots that you can slip your hand through, and with a small piece of 80 grit sand paper I was able to slightly form the inside of the helmet to fit my odd dome. It took around 15 minutes but I now have a completely custom fit and I've honestly never had a more comfortable helmet.
B0061FY004|5|This is a great product. It works just like it says it does. Sure, it takes a little extra time to set up then just drilling a hole through a pipe. But it is worth the effort to use this tool. It keeps the drill bit straight as it goes through the pipe making it easier to put the bolt in. It's centered.
B00C2BQXX8|4|Just got it but pleased so far.  Looks good, feels a little cheaper than I'd like but only time will tell
B000IY4BIK|5|Rotors fit perfectly on my 2010 Honda Accord Ex-L. The stock rear pads on this year Accord wear out way to quickly. I have 27k miles before they needed replacement. I combined these pads with Akebono ProACT 1336 which also fit perfect on my 2010. I've never had a problem with Centric rotors or Akebono ProACT pads so this will continue to be my go to combination for brakes.
B004X70LZA|5|great
B0076PL0SS|3|works ok
B005F9KWVI|5|Just what I needed for my newly aquired Cadillac CTS, or I should say it needed it. It works great, no problems at all. Just get a lock smith to key it and your good to go. Now that he gave me the key sequence I could do it myself.
B004C0XKGK|5|Work as expected and save lot of money.
B004MTTGZU|3|You get what you pay for. For a $20 knife it's not too bad. The blade and good and sharp, it comes with a replacement pocket clip and it's good size. With that being said, the handle looks like it's made out of golf balls, it's really heavy and too thick for comfortable everyday carry. The blade needs some lube to help it open smoother. But like a said for a $20 knife it's pretty decent. Good enough for a work knife.
B001F0M7L4|4|I just received my Sierra International Marine Trim sender and limit switch units.  The items were packaged nicely and comes with everything shown in the picture plus an instructional sheet on how to install, route the wiring and calibrate the units to one's Trim gauge on the boat's dashboard.  The package does not include the two screws (3/16ths dia.-32tpi by 11/16ths long) that attach the trim units to the outdrive housing nor the metal clip that holds the units in place.  Although it was not a huge problem for me because I had some spare screws in my parts bin that I was able to use.  I had to make the two metal clips that hold the pucks in place at the adjustment slots.  Normally the screws are already on the boat but in my scenario the previous owner had removed the Trim limit and Trim Sender pucks (and associated hardware) due to the wiring being rotted away.<br /><br />I feel the supplier of these units should also include the screws and clips with the purchase of a complete set.  But like I said earlier, I was able to supply my own screws so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Now, just waiting for the bellows kit to arrive to install these on the boat.
B00RW7WBR4|5|Ordered this for my 2010 nissan altima and they came in just a few days. One of the wipers was damaged on arival. So I wanted it replaced. They replied to my email incredibly fast and shipped me a replacement in just a few days. The wipers work amazing. No rain stands a chance on my windshield now. Definitely getting my windshield wipers from them again. They are cheap, work fantastic and get shipped super fast.
B000SXCLIS|5|great cover great price
B00NQ198LC|5|Easy instal. The first one, didn't seem to go right, but that was more my installation than the product. After that, easy in, easy out, easy lock, easy unlock. Good purchase
B00HHJI41Y|1|the package came but nothing was in it haha very funny
B001ILOE8Y|5|fit perfect.greasable. half the price from napa. napa got caught fixing prices. they got a big fine. but prices never went down. tell them you know
B00TP11HTS|5|Started everything so far.
B000BP7M8W|5|works
B005J1UK2I|4|As expected meet my needs
B00TE8OKA0|5|nice cover
B00TIXY6KU|4|Exactly what I wanted!
B00N5MVB5I|5|Fit my 2012 Genesis RSpec sedan with no issues. Easy to replace and look great.
B00IKKS4W8|5|Great product. Great hardware.
B00CTTH1U2|4|Arrived on time,look great in my car, just bright enough.
B00L40ZQGS|1|Didn't work right out of the box, now I have to go through the haste of trying to return it and get a refund.
B010R1Z4T8|5|After I ordered this fuel cell I was very impressed by the quality of the cell. Heavy guage walls , plug on sending unit. Came with fitting nuts on cell , also has foam for anti slosh . This fuel cell is just as good and any RCI fuel cell I have bought in the past . I plan on buying a couple more just to have .
B006OZELLE|5|These are great bags, real leather and thick. Designed never to sag. No disappointments
B00D1SVJWQ|5|Mercedes OEM.  Perfect fit and prompt shipping.
B000BZL0LC|1|OEM fit yes.<br />It fits but it does not work despite the MIL code indicated that this is the fault. OEM sensor Denso fixed problem.. If you are prepping car to sell and its out of your hair then buy this and remember the whole Karma thing. .Sensor will not be a permanent fix for this problem.
B002IX4M42|5|Love the look and feel, fits VERY snugly, but that was expected, looks and feels great
B006JN5ED0|4|Sharp plastic edges should have been filed down by the manufacturer, otherwise, they will dig into and gouge your dashboard every time you open or close it.  After unwittingly damaging my dash, I filed down the sharp edges and have since had no problem.  Once it is installed, it cannot be re-installed because the sticky clamps will not hold a second time if removed. Manufacturer should offer extra brackets.
B0045XRK06|5|This was the perfect solution to my problem of wanting to work while watching television at night.  I just plug it into my usb port and adjust it so it illuminates the keyboard.  It is bright enough to see what I need to see, but no so bright as to disturb others watching television.  I have also found that if I need to gently illuminate a larger area of the desk I just adjust it higher and it works perfectly.  Highly recommend.
B0010FZE5U|5|My original wheel cylinders were leaking and these OE cylinders were a perfect fit.  My original attaching bolts were rusted also, so the new bolts that came with these were very much needed and appreciated.  The attaching brake line was rusted, but with a little patient and some penetrating oil, the line broke loose as was able to be removed.
B00062ZDJ0|5|fit great
B00A3N8VX2|1|just stickers on a blank plate, sure it will be  toast after 1 year of Arizona sun.
B000GTUM9O|4|Almost perfect. Easy easy easy to install. Makes the ride that much more fun and now go longer and longer.
B003TU6066|5|Works GREAT!!! not one problem :)
B00COYNVPQ|4|I love this steering wheel cover. I'm not usually a fan of them but I wanted to stem the cracking and fading the sun is causing on my steering wheel, so why not do it with something that can show off my geek power level?!<br /><br />The Darth Vader steering wheel cover is great with ONE small caveat (and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5) and that is this: the Vader image is going the same way in all instances around the wheel. This means that he will be upside down on one side of your steering wheel and you have to choose which side it will be. I'd have much preferred it be designed for two of the images be &#34;planned&#34; for being upright on either side of the wheel. That's all. Call it a minor annoyance for me and one that I want you to be aware of prior to purchasing it. Consider yourselves &#34;warned&#34;.
B000BKEBOU|2|Smelled, burnt off within a few days of application.
B007KPFDKA|5|Great
B001V8RYTA|5|These rug stakes are great to use with our Presto outdoor rug. They're simple to stake in the ground and pull out easy.
B00E58JM20|5|Perfect fit and easy installation.
B006B7YIQS|3|Like it but Cel goes on now ... On and off
B005G5QWHY|5|Good seal pullers, glad I bought them. Makes the task of pulling seals easy. Good tools to have in the toolbox.
B0067ECOCU|5|Great product!
B0064SGRPE|3|Easy to install and looks nice on my jeep. It provides some type of protection for my radiator from debris and bugs but not any of significance. The openings on the grill are too wide. I am ordering a different one.
B00CCZ12WQ|5|I love this visor. I have a Corazon Shoei and it looks like it's should've come standard with this visor.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Installed on my 2015 f150 in the rear license plate light sockets.  Everything else was LED but those, now it all matches.  Works perfect and easy to install
B004FH5QDK|5|excellent product thanks
B00KQXKG46|5|Installed this light bar onto my vehicle 5 months ago and it works flawlessly to this day, not a single led bulb has gone out and it looks great and has no condensation inside the glass because there are silicone seals built in around the edges of the glass. This is by far the best &#34;China&#34; light bar I have seen. Make sure to connect with proper 12-10 gauge wire,have a solid ground, and use a Bosch style spdt relay. Pro tip: if you don't want to have a cheap looking aftermarket switch cluttering up your beautiful dashboard, wire the relay turn on wire to a fuse in the engine bay corresponding to a factory switch of some sort. For example I have mine wired to my factory fog light switch located in my blinker so not only is it easy to access but the interior remains clean and uncluttered and I had no need to run wire through the firewall. Easy breezy!
B001G4Z5J0|5|I took a camping trip to Canada with the whole family in the summer, we loaded more than 200 lb of stuff on the carrier, went through numerous rains, bumpy road , up and down the hills, this cargo carrier worked really well with absolutely no problem. I highly recommend it.
B00YI3IGA6|5|These shade sox are pretty awesome. They fit my little Kia Rio perfectly and have plenty of give left. I was afraid of how it would look or disrupt the look of my car but in all actuality they aren't bad at all. They make the back windows look extremely tinted but you can't really tell there is anything on the outside of the window unless you're really looking for it. To me it looks better than regular window shades for sure. I had a set off the kind that stick to your window but I didn't like that I was unable to roll the windows down to let the hot air out when I first start driving. They would fall off sometimes, too and while driving that's definitely a distraction I didn't need. While these are EXCELLENT at blocking out the glare I did notice that at night they make it impossible to see out of those windows and make it difficult to change lanes safely. I just remove them for night driving and otherwise they're all good. I'm so pleased that I found these and would recommend them for anyone with children or regular backseat passengers. I did receive my Shade Sox free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this shade.
B00J4XG3VE|5|Exactly hat I wanted
B00Z2ZH42U|5|Upon first look when I opened the fenders from the packaging they looked great! I've heard horror stories of similar fenders from other companies arriving and the finish was chipped off and dinged up but these fenders were perfect! Install was easy took about 2.5 hrs. To make sure your install goes smoothly try to get a rivnut setter! All in all I'm very happy with the fenders and the look great and feel very sturdy!
B00W2PKLKU|5|Can't really say anything negative. It was a reasonable price, arrived earlier than expected and was a perfect replacement. I had the new part and car running again before the dealership said they could.
B0081SBYMG|5|Seems to be a very good option, and fits well.
B00OVC4D2O|5|Great
B00IO3KQPO|3|The gel does not relieve the pressure enough.  It does not make my car ride any more enjoyable.  It just plain did not help.
B0027685P2|5|Excelling product. Super service from amazone.
B0002SQYTG|5|Milton is hands down the best air gauge. I've got 4 of these now and they are spot on accurate between all of them. Compare these to any other air gauge and you will laugh at the accuracy of other gauges. Made in the USA
B011KHEHWS|4|I bought this for the purpose of drying my dachshund after baths. It's fairly absorbent and a good sized towel for him, however, I wish it were thicker.
B004WLNZZA|5|I'm not using them as designed... used for strap protection while tying my bikes to trailers... I'll be buying more too...
B004GE779S|5|Fit great
B004P91LRI|5|This muffler is just what I had hoped it would be.  I installed it in approx. 30 min.  Would tell my friends to getit.  It was a little pricey, but I feel that it was worth it.
B0002SRCMO|5|Great tool for the fender hardware.  A must have.  makes it so much easier to replace hardware.
B00DNKW0RA|5|Love them
B001QVFVZ6|5|Best wax i have ever used.
B00ZBBD1XG|5|They work great and fit perfectly. They also arrived fast.
B00X6DIEII|1|Was not compatable with my vehicle although the product information said it was.
B003AOOMS4|5|Excellent
B000CHHS7Y|5|No issues, looks like a quality product. Installed it easily and so far so good.
B00ZB84CDM|5|Very satisfied !! Definitely worth the money, very white, very clear, awesome lights !!
B00K73SNJU|5|Exactly what I expected
B0000AXTUY|5|Awesome charger......save me a couple of times already......works very well<br />....every vehicle owner should have one of this......thank you very much
B00880R7QY|1|not As expected
B00XPTQYDU|5|Just as the discription says, perfect fit but not heated nor auto dimming.
B006WAMMOO|2|Get what you pay for. They are sufficient, they slide around a lot and do not fit tightly
B00GI7815K|1|I have bought several pairs of these trying to get them to work, installed resistors with no luck and then changed out flasher module. Worked for a few weeks and then LED's start flickering and go out completely within a few months whereas they are supposed to last &#34;10,000 hours&#34;. I purchased all of the pairs from O'Reilly's and at $20+ a pop, it added up quick for something that absolutely will not last you. Don't waste your time with Pilot automotive if you want to make the switch to LED. Spend a little more money for something that will actually last you.
B003W45L1O|2|Very poor heat guard
B00UBNGAI2|5|There's no reason for me to keep any of the other products I've used in the past in my cabinet. Gloss It is easy to use and I've never seen a car with a better looking polish on it.
B001BNHY1S|5|Love them
B0115Z4E5A|4|Great product,  very similar to the grimspeed one but needs some work on the wiring since it comes with no plugs. The only negative thing is that no installation manual comes with it.
B00652XFZE|4|I works for those tough to reach paces... but, it takes some effort to get all the dirt.
B00155237W|5|I was worried it was going to be too dark to see my tag numbers but it was perfect
B001B58ZM8|5|This clutch set works well, no problems so far. The price was very reasonable.
B00827B1TC|3|I used this to try to clean out a carb on a 2 year old Husquevarna chainsaw. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I can't blame the product though, as I should have been more diligent about using marine fuel stabil on the chainsaw gas.
B007559CVQ|5|Worked as stated.  Goofy steps to program must have been thought up during major buzz!  Do them all as stated and it will work.
B00I36CMMC|5|It fit perfectly
B0010GG7YG|5|Perfect fit took literally seconds to install.
B00FJT0304|5|Good quality good price.
B000BZI1PA|3|This was supposed to be OEM fit, but plug did not match 2003 Camry 4 Cyl. I had to splice old plug onto new sensor. Otherwise, it appears to be very well made.
B004Y9D0NC|5|After 3 times of having to get this in the right color I really love it now. It said it was pink and each time it surely wasn't.
B009FUFCDQ|5|I use these amazing cloths for everything;wet and dry!!  Glad I bought the large bunch. Would make a great Christmas gift.
B0024EDYN0|5|Very good item fast getting to me
B0012PSH7U|4|Can't say I &#34;love&#34; an air shock, but this lifts my truck as intended. Works well to level the load when I put my slide-in truck camper in the bed.
B00K5L8CPO|2|sigh
B004A66JSC|5|Excellent
B00GBOMUV6|5|Installed in a matter of minutes make sure you do it on a hot day so the double sided tape adheres to the vehicle weatherproof trimming
B003YI1784|5|Great item, tough, easy to clean.
B00ZGHN1SK|5|Good very fit fits as expected
B000C9AIKQ|5|Good
B004HCM9H4|5|I have tried some others and always coma back to this, I love how it shines, and does not streak my dark blue car.<br />Easy on and off, and does not frost the black plastic or rubber. The microfiber towel included adds to my collection.<br />Seems to last at least several washes. I wish there was a product that simply did not let the bugs stick, this may be as close as it gets.
B00DI3DV6G|5|Cool
B003E02MMC|5|perfect for police bike with lighter
B00N18UBS4|5|MUST HAVE ANOTHER SET FOR MY BACK UP CAR. VERY GOOD.
B00J7RB72M|5|Great product , fast delivery
B004QEQIN4|1|worked one year and failed, stuck window in down position on drivers side and was overheating motor I have asked about lifetime warranty haven't got an answer back . I believe  i will try dorman thru a local supplier with better guarantee .
B000C8Z6W2|5|Worked like a champ. The fit was great, went on without any problems. Shipping was fast and the packaging kept it from being damaged in transit. I'm going to buy another for a dual exhaust job I'm working on.
B000VKVXOG|5|A good buy on a helpful item.  Easy to install with no tools.  Makes the car air nicer.
B004A66JMS|5|Excellent
B00GRV7U40|1|This system has to be the most money I have ever wasted on a product. I still can not believe Stacie Davis endorsed this product. Good luck doing more then two brake bleeds with it.
B000CQBND0|5|As advertised, great transaction
B0007M1I2A|3|Fit in vehicle very well.  However it should warn you before you purchase about the wiring issues that these vehicles have.  The factory hitch is much more expensive, so that is why we went with this product.  But, the wiring is BUILT IN to the factory Audi hitch.  That is the only reason the rating is low.  Otherwise, would have been a 5.
B00771ZCPS|5|Fits like a glove and looks beautiful!!
B00NLJ02ZA|4|My only criticism comes from the wobbliness of the product; it doesn't stay put without the overhead shade blockers (I'm not used to that problem with my other shade and other car).<br /><br />Otherwise it does a fairly decent job.
B001OAASTI|4|It's small but cool.
B00P3PR9C4|4|These are very good lights. I used them on a motorcycle and they are not the best fit for that application. They are so tall they just barely fit under the lens covers. Time will tell how well they ho old up. The last ones only lasted a year or so. (Different manufacture)
B0034HNMQK|5|Excellent Filter - this one and Mobile 1 are the only filters I use..
B007OW6JEI|5|It's a quality product with reasonable price.
B00ES5QJM6|2|Too big and ugly
B006WWQLQM|1|It was not as bright as I was expecting. It didn't brighten up my fog lights at all. It's as if it is made for decoration instead helping your sight while driving.
B00MVAHCM6|5|Good product
B0016IT4HA|4|working proper thanks
B003O8X4UI|3|Seems like it will protect the headlights well, but the film is easily damaged during installation.  If the film is not completely covered with solution on every squeegee wipe, the surface becomes rough and foggy and will not clear up with time as other installation side effects do.  I was meticulous with my installation as I suspected this could be a problem and still could not avoid it.
B00AAR1BVA|4|I've used this a few times now. The manual adapters, though physically larger, make it easier to attach/detach. Small leak around one of the seals, but I think it wasn't seated correctly. I would suggest the case isn't that useful, since most people leave the hoses connected.
B00OHRLR18|1|Seat belt extenders sold me an extender that didn't work on the car it was purchased for. They sent me the correct item but I had to pay for Shipping and Handling buy buying this.
B007W57Z18|5|Fantastic
B004A0VBUO|5|Great
B000GZELSQ|5|excellent item excellent price
B0087JAQZA|5|I love the way my tail lights turned out. Super easy instal. The modifier that is suggested is really almost required or the taillights will blink to fast to be noticable.
B00VYGB1IO|5|Fast delivery, nice fit.
B00KK98KO4|4|Look good for the money
B002E1AYU4|5|Awesome
B008A1NMC4|5|good price
B004AH4O9W|5|Handy replacement kit of mixed fuses.
B000CB94PY|5|Fit Perfectly  2008 C300 - Easy Install
B000RXNLK6|4|This has isopropyl alcohol in it. One thing to note. It seems to work well if directions are followed. There are better products out there, but this might be for you depending on where you park your car, climate, etc. I gave it 4 stars but could have easily given it 3. It's just too hard to compare this against all other products out there. If you want something a little more harsh this might be for you.  EDIT : After using the whole bottle, I can say this is great for getting the tougher stuff off your car. For those of us who park outside, we have to deal with tree sap, bug droppings, bird droppings, etc. This is the best at this kind of thing without harming the paint. (that I have tried to far) I just ordered 2 more bottles. It has it's use. I recommend it. My car is white, for darker paint colors I don't know how it works, but I have to assume similar. I still wouldn't give it 5 stars but it's good stuff.
B001RZ65MO|5|Outstanding product.  Fits in my truck perfectly and pretty covers the entire bumper.  A necessary item here in Washington DC.
B0016LG2G8|4|Great product.
B00YOC99HU|5|Saved me from a grumpy screaming child. My son hates the sunlight hitinf his eyes but loves looking outside the window at the same time.<br />This sunshade helped me out a lot. I don't have to listen to my son screaming while I'm driving.<br />Thanks a lot!<br />I got this item on a discount price but that's just a plus. I would still buy this even without discount.
B00C7RFLVC|4|This was purchased with a gift card, otherwise would not have gotten them. That's why 4 stars, not 5, as this is a rather expensive way to cover up unsightly airbag decals. (Those decals are not very helpful when most of what they say, in multiple languages, concerns placement of car seats and does not apply to a 2 seater 'Vette!) They certainly do look better than the decals, no argument there, but at $15 each.....as stated, very glad it was a gift and sure hope the glue holds up in the Florida heat.
B002LCDA3E|5|It was as decribed! Came quickly and couldn't wait to put it on my new car!
B005CLLAC4|5|Thank You
B011JA8BVE|5|I love having this 4 port USB car charger!  We are a family of 6 who travel frequently.  Of course everyone’s devices run out of power around the same time leading to lots of arguing over who is going to charge their devices first.  With this 4 port car charger we’re now spoiled!  It charges our tablets, phones and even my son's NIntendo DS!  Long car rides with four boys are now so much more bearable!  Krieger’s 4 port USB car charger is well made.  It charges up to 9.6 Amps at a time.  That is the equivalent of 2.4 Amps per device.  In other words, it can easily charge four tablets at once! I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  This is a great car charger that comes with a lifetime warranty!  I highly recommend this 4 port USB car charger!
B00G5OPO1U|5|Fit as described.
B000CITK8S|1|Product stop working after using for two months
B000QUXYXE|5|Very pleased
B004EK0E5S|4|It looks great installed but if you have never changed a dash I recommend that you go to UTube and watch a presentation on how it is done.
B00MWQ6J7S|5|They have the perfect size and a very nice bright, i think is almost brighter than my normal incandescent bulbs, used them to replace the cluster, interior and license plate lights, and worked perfectly with such a bright pure white light. Also the price is very cheap
B00NUE5QKW|4|i had purchased the other rubber antenna 7 inch and I was not able to get any reception for the radio stations in my Jeep. Then, I purchased this one antenna, The Shorty, to replace the first one and the reception improved but not like the original antenna that came on my Jeep. All in all, reception is somewhat better but not acceptable to my standards still. For now, it just looks better than the original antenna.
B00BAZCPW0|4|good for the money
B007F0RJ3O|5|Perfect fit for a 2015 Prius.  Seems like it will protect the trunk well.
B00PUXS95U|1|Don't stick to your car.....it fell out only after three days....I live in Trinidad so maybe it's the sun.....
B000C53QAY|5|fast service, works great
B005CLPFMA|4|came as expected. Door Handle fit perfectly
B00480FHIS|5|Great item, great price. Will purchase again!
B00829I2ME|5|Replaced this myself this weekend and the part fits great and sound of rattling bearing is gone. Toyota is scratched off on the part but it is still OEM part. Comes with the gasket and seals that need to be replaced as well. Don't take it to the dealer to do this if you are somewhat mechanically inclined. I was able to change it out myself and save about $600. I used this DIY on club lexus: http://www.clublexus.com/forums/is-2nd-gen-2006-2013/725467-diy-how-to-replace-the-water-pump-on-the-is-250-a.html<br /><br />I also replaced the thermostat and serpentine while i was at it. You have to take these off anyways while replacing the pump. Make sure you order two gallons of toyota super long life coolant too. You will have to drain it out.
B001GC2WB6|5|Always  great product.
B001C6N6J8|5|It works.
B00LZ5LOD6|4|Looks great arrived on time should send some velcro to stick in both lower corners.. will flap while driving.  Double sided tape or velcro worked great.
B000C9FZFY|3|I ordered 2 pcs. of the brake drum but the other was back  order , had to reschedule the maintenance until Amazon ship out the 2nd one.<br />Renewal part seems to be okay  maybe this time just need to spray paint the outside against rust exposure . I will update this product compare with the OEM on the vehicle.
B007QBVG90|5|Fit and received in only a few days!
B00LUPOU1O|5|These are perfect for my Jeep JK, easy to store and easy to use. no more scratches and nicks.
B00GHRZF2I|5|my hubby like it coz its fit perfect to our truck...great product.got discount for my honest review
B0009OMYDS|4|Excellent parts cleaning brush.  Bristles are stiff enough to break a lot of crud loose without marring the surface you're attempting to clean.
B00WQ9VKNY|3|One of the screws were mangled at the tip and was the wrong length. I had to go to the hardware store to buy a replacement.
B00AO78PPG|5|the starter works fine but be sure you have a steel flywheel ring on it
B000QPZIPG|1|Hardware missing from product...box was open
B00LV3KCVC|4|Adequate!  I had to clean the cut threads out of 2 of them.  Update:  When I changed to my winter tires last fall the extremely thin plating came right off.  I guess the good news is that the wheels didn't fall off.
B000VKK126|1|Does not fit Europe models of wrx sti 2006 and 2007. Could not use it and I was pushed to reuse the old seal.
B003CJ719E|1|In my 26 years of owning and riding motorcycles, I've never experienced such a pathetic failure as this chain demonstrated.  I installed this chain on a 2003 Kawasaki ZZR1200 along with 2 new steel Sunstar sprockets.  I noticed this chain stretched pretty quick and required tightening every 500 miles, where EVERY previous chain would take 2K-3K miles before tensioning.  The last interval was only 400 miles and the chain became so slack it was wrapped over the center stand while the bike was parked.  So after only 3,400 miles I'm forced to replace this chain and 2 more sprockets along with labor for the work.  The factory chain was EK and lasted 25K miles, the replacement was an RK and lasted 28K miles, this chain is defective or a counterfeit from China and is a worthless waste of money.
B00PTQOF4W|3|switches work and look good.  had to cut out quite a bit of the harness to fit my satisfaction (was too long, and didn't want wires all bundled up) but works great so far
B00IITX6KQ|2|Got an extra star because the LED lights work on the trailer. Only giving it two stars because the product packaging states for it to facilitate LED trailer lights to work seamlessly with European cars with OEM hitches installed (mine was installed on my Audi SUV from the factory): the trailer &#34;light out&#34; indicator trips on the dashboard so this doesn't work. Bought a TrailerReady version of this, looks quite similar, and it works better. If you don't care about the indicator lamp out on the dash, just get a cheap, $5 version of this adapter and it'll do the same thing.
B009MAT5IM|5|fit perfect it is easy to use but replaced car with sonata and it still does the job
B000C7QHRQ|5|Very please with the item great seller!
B007LQPCY0|5|Very well-made should protect the carpets very well very happy with purchase
B00AJZ61G8|5|Very nice looking housing, I couldnt use it for what I bought it for because I needed to put a splash gaurd on and there isn't enough room to put this on. To use any regular car radio you need to open up the slots to make the larger hole. then the radio slides in it is very slick low profile. I wish I could have used it where I bought it for but as good as it l makes it look, I will end up using it some where.
B002Y37TZK|5|Great product!
B003AMSUNO|5|The tie down was very easy to install on my truck. Very sturdy product. It should last a long time.
B00ATPFZ8S|5|Great Item daughter sueprised  arrived on time THANKS
B00B8K9A1G|5|Perfect
B0007RS4FY|4|Good product !!
B003YLVCFY|5|Well, it's a sticker that says I heart giraffes. I bought it as part of a gift for a friend who loves giraffes. The sticker fits in a regular mailing envelope and looks exactly like the photos. I did notice that this is a little smaller than most bumper stickers I've seen.
B001GC2LVM|2|I purchased this product and the second time that I backed off of the levelers the &#34;chock&#34; cracked.  For $86 this product should be more durable.
B00MFBVNUI|5|We're good product👍👍👍
B001FCC6RC|4|This had everything that I needed.
B0024E6TX2|5|This regulator works great!
B001V8U12M|4|Works great
B009IN0AUU|4|worked good
B00U8695HK|3|Like other reviews, one negative is that it stays on if plugged in.  When ppl have driven in my car after using the ionizer, some said it smelled the same while others said it was better.  inconclusive as of now.
B00I5HRTU4|5|Used this as a connector strap for my wheel chocks.  Perfect length to span both rear wheels and it's as strong as it gets.
B003VAUFKG|5|Did just what we needed it to do. We were a little short on our tow chains after adding a bike rack.
B000COVXBO|1|Ordering info on page is not clear that this item is for the hood & not the hatchback.
B006QH54VQ|5|Redtops!
B002MQAWOY|1|I don't like this material on my face. I wear it walk my dogs in the Chicago winter. The material is so thin and gets soaking wet when I breath. Once it got wet, I had to remove it off my face because it doesn't keep you warm at all.
B001DVTVZK|5|Looks sharp, although I painted mine already.  Wish It came with magnet, but otherwise I am very happy with it.
B00TX42T1W|4|[[VIDEOID:2f349612a5f472751f1a90f25424619c]] Good price for a tach, I could not complain more for something with a shift light and multi color modes. My only concern is the response lag the tach has. Although the main use of this tach is for sim racing games like Grid Autosport, iRacing, F1 2014. I was still hoping for better response. My friends play the same games but use an expensive tach like autometer etc and i see a good response. Well this is what you get for $40.
B00TH6M8K8|5|Works well. I have used them several times and they work great and pop back down when not in use.
B00G4RV9MQ|3|color wasn't even close to a match
B00CFBVV2S|2|WRONG TYPE FOR MY CAR
B00KPWW3DA|5|Good fit and looks great
B001MOTXK6|5|This was a great purchase. My only problem was that it was to be delivered at the end of July and i didn't get it until August 15th. Even with the long wait it was well worth it.
B00IWSMQ0Y|5|I had a bad vibration in the old one. Put the new one in and I fit perfect and has no vibration at all. Only took 30 min. to install.
B004PXAUGC|5|Exactly what it should be
B00KGEIX9K|1|Never actually got the correct product. Returned item and reordered twice and I kept receiving the wrong item.
B008LEO080|5|Nice decal !
B00R7ORS34|1|Irritated, but you get what you pay for.  The 4th time after using the tool it snapped where it seats on the axle nut while torquing to 105 lbs.
B00TADQTOY|5|Great product at the unbeatable price. It always puzzle me WHY some parts would cost x5 or even x10 time more at the dealership or at the local store? it's made in the same CHINA. Thank you for making parts afordable
B000EQ6AKE|5|Quality product that met my expectations. Delivered on time per schedule.
B0101VKCO6|3|They fit Rockford application which is not the direction I went so I couldn't use them, but it's a good product as long as you use Rockford speakers
B000RZAPPS|5|These hubs went in super easy in my F350. Easy install, good quality parts, nice solid lock in. Would buy again!
B00873J0YY|3|They suit their purpose, the foam does tear easy. I have them on a Toyota FJ Cruiser, I don't recommend this type of mount on SUV's, should only be used on regular passenger cars.
B00IGWVLPC|5|Very well made, great looking product very easy to install once the old one is off. Nice product.
B003KI44LK|5|Great fit, prefect replacement for my 04 Cooper S. I keep buying these in bulk so I do not have to go to the parts store every time I want to do and oil change on the Mini
B000WMPFX8|5|Love love love this item!! Highly recommend
B00FJQTXSU|5|Item as described and pictured. Installation was easy. Quality of the vinyl is top notch for an auto decal.
B00TFXI2XA|5|Pretty easy to install. Me and my husband did it in about an hour. Fits perfect.
B0023VITP2|5|Excellent
B00EKSBWDM|5|I love my permit....lol
B00ZY2AE6E|5|Great product! My elbow always hurt sitting at my desk. I tried putting other things under my elbow but this never really worked in the past. The gelepad is really comfortable and takes away all the pressure. When I move it, it does not leave a mark on my desk. As they are pretty inexpensive, I'll get one for my car and maybe one for under my mouse hand.
B005BFM0AC|5|Worked great - no complaints.
B000BH5MAA|4|If you have a small one axle camper, there is no easier way to get level!! I only give this a 4 star because mine came without the ratchet. I was too lazy to call and have it replaced, any 3/4 ratchet will work.
B007XX8CIO|1|Not legal in Massachusetts despite what someone Write earlier.
B0046IXXLA|5|Fast service and easy to install!  Excellent product!
B001PYSU7A|3|All was good until I got to the springs I have a 1964 Impala 4 door<br />My springs are different on my car so I ended using the old ones<br />The site said this kit fit my 64 impala so something went wrong<br />But its OK I made do
B00U87J5AQ|4|I had an issue with the lacking of a gasket -- I contacted the seller, and they did not know how to resolve the issue, but they tried to help, and were very courteous and prompt to answer my emails -- but, upon doing some web-based research, I realized that the manifold and test pipe were mocked-up from a 95-99 Plymouth Breeze (same as a Neon, but with a different collector flange setup). Once I figured this out, I locally sourced the needed components: collector donut (Walker # 31531), and a bolt and spring kit (Walker # 35031), the combo costing about $30. As well as, the #3 cylinder pipe is too close to its lower bolt hole, which means: you'll need an Allen head bolt, and that bolt will have to be threaded in first, and you'll have to walk the manifold to the cylinder head with that bolt (this makes for a slow install, but it'll work). Other than those issues, the header and test pipe are a great deal! It's a short-runner header, so the noticeable power gain is mostly in the top end of the power band, but it's there! I coupled the exhaust with their Short Ram Induction kit, a new intermediate pipe, and an OE muffler (all sourced from Amazon), which keeps it quiet, until I go wide open throttle! Plus, I wrapped the header, and test pipe, with header wrap, which dropped the under-hood temp. a bit, and there's a noticeable reduction in heat from the cabin floor. All-in-all, for less than $300, I completely replaced my exhaust system from the cylinder head back, and it sounds, and runs, great!
B00AC89JTS|5|Outstanding Product.
B009J2J0SI|1|Don't get this carrier if you have a large kayak (I have a tandem sit-on-top).  The pads on the saddles do not have any grip, and the saddles flop from side to side.  And the pins in the saddles started working themselves out after only 2 uses.  I finally gave up on these.
B002L9J0VI|3|works fine
B002P36O64|5|this stuff is fantastic !!!
B002X9TNFE|5|Highly recommended
B00H7LPKKU|5|This is in the top ten of my all-time best purchases.  I have found only a couple of grease fitting in really tight places that it will not fit.  I used to especially dread greasing my hay baler, but now I almost look forward to it.  Quite frankly, I think it is an amazing product and I now own two of them.
B0002JMIEK|4|Been using this for years and it last at least 3 times as much as normal 'wax'. My only complaint is that it goes 'bad' over a period of time. I figure there may be something organic in it.
B009AQS4IU|5|Love the way they look on my car and they are made well.
B002P8QI4W|5|Perfect fit looks just like the original.  Took about 10 minutes to replace using a 10mm socket.  Comes with a new rubber gasket and has the foam backing. Be sure to tighten firmly but not over tighten.  When putting the nuts on be careful not to drop them or you have to take out the speaker to recover it.  The motor plugs right in and works.  Tip - to remove the old mirror use a small slotted screw driver to push the old gasket gently out.  Use your fingers to push the new one in.
B007HG7SM8|5|great item
B004I0SWH6|5|Received as expected via amazon prime...fit perfectly
B00A740VQM|3|Pro - Has lots of different small driver bits.Con - The handle doesn't hold the bits too strongly, so the bit will disappear up into the handle with any kind of downward pressure. Very frustrating. The bits are held in place in their storage slots very strongly, so getting them out can be a challenge. I'm not sure I would buy another.
B000NVW1LM|1|THIS DID NOT WORK JUST THROUGH MONEY AWAY...
B0031GT3IK|5|deliverd on time, fits better  than original  thank you
B00DRG2NA4|5|only had it on a week now but it's great. car looks amazing, the water beads up very well and it was easy to put on and take off. I didn't pay attention but the paint cleaner is not to be used on dark colors. so that was a waste for me but it was my fault for not seeing that before I bought it. great stuff.
B00C59BRHY|2|Bought this 4-pack twice.<br />First batch went bad in 4 months and the second batch went bad in 3 weeks.<br />Lesson here is you get what you pay for.<br /><br />Sorry, can't recommend.
B003NI1H6W|5|Installed and worked as advertised. No problems so far.
B00SS15BH0|1|I like the bag, however, the rain cover is useless because when you tie the  bag onto your motorcycle it becomes impossible to put the rain cover on and not have it fly off while you're riding. If there were slits in the waterproof cover to slip the Deerings through it would be better. This is an expensive bag and I would've thought that this would've been accounted for.
B0068ERZN2|4|Contact with seller was made to ask for fast shipping. Seller respoded quickly and assured shipping to specified date. The product showed up as promissed. I'm 6'1&#34; and 300lbs and the 4xl fits as expected. For people who want to wear it over a jacket it is a little tight around the waist line. The sleeves on the other hand are way to loose. The pants fit nicely, I wouldn't want the legs to be any shorter though. Overall I would say good product for the money. No pockets.
B00GVTLB2A|4|Seemed to do the job and the paint match was near perfect. The clear coat really helps it blend in.
B001UCDEF0|5|they work just great, stops quicker than my other pads
B000EDSSMA|5|great product, easy to assemble
B00X9LQAQA|5|Awesome design and functionality
B000BR3BF8|5|Better mileage and more horsepower, what's not to like?
B00DPM3C6Y|4|Easy to install.  Works great.  Bike is running much better.
B0066T5RH0|5|Looks to be a solid replacement for the OEM bushing.
B001EP0GSG|5|Great product.  Install not to bad.
B00MXF4N8U|1|I have been getting P0420 on my Camry 2000 for a while(100k milage). Used 2 bottles within a month but it didn't fix anything. So it's not working for me at all. I don't know if it's just me or what, seems worked for a lot people but me.
B0016KABBQ|4|Product as advertised. True Reese hitch at a reasonable price.
B00TTLR8VK|5|Super concentrated and smells like candy
B00861JEKW|5|My Z28 flies again!  Great price too.
B00EC2CG9U|5|These seem to be hard to find and I really use quite a few of them.
B004ZF4MW8|5|I would have to say that I am quite impressed with the company's customer service. With my initial purchase of this HID kit, it didn't work for my Porsche Cayman so I went ahead and returned it. I then received an email from one of the representatives almost immediately. He worked closely with me over the next couple of weeks to make sure that I received tech and equipment support I needed to get the kit to function properly on my car. Everything works quite well for me car and I am satisfied with the purchase. I recommend this kit and if for some reason it doesn't work (e.g. blinking when switched to on position), go ahead and contact the company -- they will work with you and provide the support that you need.
B000C9RNFE|3|It does what it is supposed to do.
B00BBL4YPO|5|This decal is awesome. Truly sets off my truck from others.
B000JZEZG6|1|No or ring as stated and no studs as stated
B007DE8JR2|5|Love this!
B0041TJQTC|5|Perfect fit for my 06 Subaru Legacy Limited.  No more noise, and it works great.
B00GJKXW8M|5|great lights
B00KMR3J7M|5|Solid product
B00ELRZDAK|4|Stunning light Stunning Reaction BUT if you do have a Jeep Liberty in the years 2002-still round models The Instructions are Wrong and the Size isn't 100% accurate and I Ended up messing up BOTH my light Housings Installation is actually simplier than all the other ones If you want instructions i'd be glad to help, I think I am going to order new lights and make an instructional video myself since noone has one online.
B00R9C8KPO|3|Color is different of the pic, it is more violette the blue...so if you want to match with other blue accesories make sure to choose the right color.
B00M3ENQXE|4|A little bit of a shipping problem that was resolved after contacting the seller.<br />The keys worked as advertised.  Went to ACE hardware and had them cut copies from an original key.  Programmed the new keys in the parking lot.  Worked perfectly the first time.  Gave 4 stars, because of the shipping delay (that they fixed quickly).
B00MX77Q5K|5|Ordered these to replace tired and leaking factory units on my 2003 honda pilot. Great fit and easy install with basic hand tools . Make sure the orientation is the same when you're putting the new unit in ( I marked the top stud before uninstall to do this ) 2-3 hrs from start to finish and very happy with ride quality now.
B000EDUUH6|5|Sturdy, looks nice and keeps our old german shepherd from walking through the screen door - again!
B0041FZ89S|5|Everything about this prodcut was worth the money and I loved installing them myself. I wont lie, the install was a total pain in my rear end and it took me almost 8 hours to install...granted some of this could have been avoided by re-reading the instructions. Overall superb quality materials and the steps are awesome, people compliment me on the steps. I will post pictures today.
B006WQS7OW|5|Great price, fast delivery, worked perfectly.
B000WJ10E4|5|I installed on a 2005 Suzi DL1000, it fits perfect! no cut or mods needed, just a little adjust to the bar ends.<br />The position is completly different vs the OEM crappy bar, great unexpensive upgrade for your bike.
B0053HPEY2|1|Sprayer was broke not happy
B00JEV2ASG|5|:)
B006YU7G8E|5|Excellent product.
B000M0H9C0|5|Good quality
B007ZDDUCK|5|Works great. Fantastic seller.
B0040JYPFS|5|Great product and fantastic upgrade to the look at my truck.  They only bummer is they have a third light option to replace the solid red one but the cost is way too hi.  I would recommend they add a combo deal to get all the light replaced at once. I highly recommend and it is a really easy do it yourself job.
B00EEMJBYQ|1|it was missing a finger Verry disapointed
B007VWYJS4|5|as needed for my old car
B0012SA7FC|5|Great quality delivered a few days late.
B001JEIHAG|5|10/10
B00XOTJ7NK|5|Plexus is a excellent cleaner for the windshield on my Harley and also for plastic visors for my helmets. This stuff was developed for the Air Force.
B005N53C9I|5|fit my cobalt seats perfectly! Love the colors, and they are very comfortable!
B007MVKI84|3|Reports from users that reliability of this maker are not the best
B000EDQQJW|5|Works great /  with the adjustable rubber feet - should work in any sink close to the dimensions provided.<br />Love the extra counter space this provides
B00JVW9XQK|4|Started unraveling as soon as my husband put a beer in...
B00J42CPZI|5|Works great.
B006QH561E|5|super impressed with this battery. Works great.
B00RLUO0WG|2|Purchased for a brand new 2015 Ford Explorer with bench 2nd seat.  Product fits &#34;OK&#34;, but not as well as WeatherTech products I've purchased in the past.  I made this purchase to attempt to save a few bucks, and I did.  But, I had to slice a piece here and there in the 2nd row mats to fit them properly next to the plastic in some areas.  I believe the front mats will be fine, but I'll be surprised if the 2nd row mats are durable enough to keep the carpet from getting destroyed and survive a northeast winter without tearing.
B009VI3T96|5|Work great with the spring.
B0051D3MP6|5|Has been working good so far, after nearly a month of straight usage. The cords are actually pretty long compared to other chargers, and the clamps are good size and quality. Possibly purchasing more of these
B00062YSHS|5|Work great.. don't leak.. what more can I say?
B00KZ0E772|5|Exelente
B006TJBFKU|5|nice!
B00WH5C4Q4|5|Very helpful item for one piece race suits
B005VD553S|1|Very disappointed with Discount Starter. The starter worked for awhile and then quit working-we bench tested it and it failed. Returned to Discount Starter and after not hearing from them for 2 weeks I called and they said the starter was fine so we told them to send it back.  Two weeks later I called again wondering if they had sent the starter and they informed me at this time that they wanted $10 to return it. We had to contact them-there seems to be no customer service.
B00J9X3S58|5|Fit 2008 TTR 230 perfectly.  Not too hard to install.  TAKE YOUR TIME.  It is worth it.<br />I used a hairdryer, cheap water battle mister from walmart and a plastic putty knife with a wash rag over it so nothing sharp touched the graphics.  And I used my fingers a lot to rub bubbles out.  Make sure you keep the graphics wet until they are where they need to be and all the bubbles are out.  Don't be affraid to peel them off and re-apply them AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THEM WET.  Use the hair dryer to warm the graphics to mold better to the plastics.  For noobs, this is a 2 person job, one laying and rubbing out bubbles and one using the hairdryer.  Youtube graphics install and there are plenty of vids to help.<br /><br />These graphics are thick, they are not stickers.  Made to last and look GREAT!  My son is pretty hard on his bike and they are still on just like they came from the factory.
B000IY422U|5|Good quality,it last years.
B001ABJKQI|5|Good quality
B00GIHS9NO|4|Arrived on time and packaged carefully.  Not sure about the gain in horsepower and gas mileage but fit perfectly.  Gives it a whistling sound every time you stomp on the gas.. sounds cool!!
B00LMDI38A|3|Does not fit flush on floor and tabs doesn't line up.  Feels very plastic.
B0084TQNBE|5|Just exactly what I wanted.
B002ZBY9HW|3|This stuff just doesn't work too great. I've used it in the past on mower and atv tires which works pretty good. However, on SUV/Light Truck tires they will not inflate the tire all the way. Really just a band-aid fix to get you a few more miles down the road. Wouldn't depend on this stuff for any long term or isolated area type usage. On one instance the slime did not distribute within the tire properly and caused a severe imbalance issue. The tire repair companies are not thrilled when they have to extract it from inside the tire to re-balance.
B000CO9T60|5|Fit my girlfriends Mazda 3 with no issues!
B004AQVWMA|5|perfect fit
B00TPSP760|5|I have only had the unit for a week, but love it. I have it mounted outside it has no issue in the rain. The unit has been reliable and the seller was very helpful. I'm new to the Electric car thing and the seller helped me out with a bunch of dumb questions.
B0033QNZZ0|5|Same quality as Mercedes-Benz antifreeze
B005NLQAHS|5|Works perfectly for what I have used it for, pulling codes, resetting. LEarning to extract perf data in Torque Pro, to better understand the manifold pressure, gas flow while driving. Graphs are very useful... this device just works!
B003OU2DXU|5|Great product!
B0096W5FF8|5|Snapped right into place took less than 15 minutes.
B00BYV4CKI|5|These mats are worth splurging on to save the floors in my RDX! I live in a city where it rains a lot and I needed something to protect my floors from dirt, grime, and stains. These are thick and solid enough that they stay into place but they are so easy to remove if need be. Rinsing them with a hose is so easy or with a little soap and water for mud buildup. Would not recommend anything else but these to RDX owners!
B0076D5OI2|5|Fits the onan 5500 generator in my camper perfectly. I am hoping this solves my problem of running for a few hours then dying out. I'll repost when I'm sure.
B0080KN7RU|5|Colors match my 2015 Kawasaki Vulcan Classic perfectly. I have received numerous compliments and people keep asking if it is painted on. Love this purchase.
B003P64XU4|5|works great for the money
B00317499M|5|Looks great.  Fits great
B004MB2MCM|5|Item as described - NIB. Would buy from again. Thx!
B004YA2726|5|Look and fit great
B002U2D8JG|5|This works great - needs to be standard on all bikes for HI VIS..... one small brake light on my V Strom just not enough. I did not enable the Knight Rider effect but the flashing five count after braking works great.
B0012ARRCQ|5|Great product. Bolted right in place on my Mac Lander.
B004K2BH4W|1|Ordered the wrong size so it did me no good
B00332GPMY|5|Look amazing. easy to install. Only thing is make sure you watch when rolling the window up, I had one of the ends not installed 100% and it broke a small piece of it off. Still works though.
B001G7CMMK|4|The NPN Fuel Filter is great cause you're installing an OEM part however, there is a small clip insertion section that broke off with some pressure... and now my fuel filter is connected to my pump where one clip is not attached.
B00K1NS0PS|5|Easy to set up and run wires
B00BFDH05Y|5|If you have AC problems on Acura RDX, replace this relay before taking to mechanic, it will save you money
B0087XZQME|1|Said it would fit my 2013 Ram 1500. Nit
B002SB03IS|5|It's tough and fits very well. Things no longer slide on my bed, and it makes your truck look nicer. I am a happy customer.
B008K8SFA6|5|Great product
B00030BFQA|5|All as it should be, from what I can tell.
B00ICSPL2E|1|Very cheep fitting fit very lose around the crash bars and shake
