0307276902|5|Although I am still in the process of reading \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" I am nearly done after three solid days of reading. This book is so captivating I find it hard to put down. And despite all the recent controversy surrounding the author, it is still a great read and look into the life of an addict.
1594203334|4|It seems this book is full of what my grandparents would have called, \\"common sense.\\"  Personal observation, not too much seems to exist in many parents today.<br /><br />Main points:  Pause and observe your young baby when he cries, and make sure he's awake and actually needing something before picking him up and waking him yourself, so he can learn to sleep through normal human sleeping cycles, such as REM to lighter. Works, evidently, up until about 4 months of age. (This takes sensitivity on the parent's part, however.)<br /><br />\\"Creche,\\" the French day care, is run by people with (gasp!) advanced degrees in child care, not a teenybopper with her ear to the phone making minimum wage. The creche usually has a good cook working there too, and the children do not learn schoolwork, but socialize and learn to get along.  \\"A pediatrician and a psychologist each visit the creche once a week!\\"  However, not surprisingly, there are waiting lines for the creche.<br /><br />When at home, young children help with cooking and chores, to learn responsibility, and starting and completing tasks.  There are cookbooks published for children.  That's help, with adult supervision!<br /><br />Meals are every 4 hours, with an afternoon (after school) snack called the \\"gouter,\\" during which small amounts of sweets can be part of the snack. Meals are eaten with adults, and with the same food as adults, always.  \\"Parents aren't short order cooks.\\"<br /><br />French parents do believe that the child can learn to deal with frustration and greed, as in not getting everything his little heart desires. The child is not the leader/head of the family.<br /><br />Children must always say \\"hello,\\" when meeting others, and also use the magic words \\"please,\\" and \\"thank you,\\"  when in the home or public.<br /><br />Not very exacting.<br /><br />There is a lot of the author's autobiographical detail to get through for the main points, but if a parent is doing something else, this may be needed.
B002N5N4M6|5|We're prudes. Not for kids. Vulgar at times and high a sexual content. Sometimes it embarrasses us to watch it. Hey, I told you we were prudes!
B007ZYJT1U|5|Well written, well acted, and incredibly real. Certainly not a light hearted movie. There is no real heroin, but you find yourself rooting for both main characters. Great movie.
B006QSL9XC|4|The film only decribes a few of the battles that took place ine Gettysburg over the 3 days.  So this is not a full accounting.  Having just visited Gettysburg National Park, the battles and carnage are still difficult to imagine, and the film only partly explores this.  It's also got a dramatic flair and, I think, General RE Lee (Martin Sheen) seems a little too pie-in-the-sky Southern idealist to be perceived as a great tactican and important General.  All that said, the movie is one of the best depictions of the Civil War.
B0094M4R3Q|4|Classic.
B008EKOO46|5|We have learned a lot as civilization  progressed, but we have apparently forgotten some very important things.It is amazing that so many of modern diseases are directely caused by our addiction to salt, sugar, and alcohol.
B00FGFVMGA|1|I gave this 1 star because I never received the game app on my device..Therefore,I didn't get to play it and can't give good review if I really don't know.
B00000JNOJ|5|Absolutely the best Muddy album I've heard. Dixon's stand-up bass sounds amazing, as does Buddy Guy's guitar.  Muddy really shows his smoothness & coolness on this album. This cd permanently resides in my player.
B00AQNOCZ0|5|Excellent collection, nice to have them all on blu-ray for acessability and the kids.
B00DQVST76|5|DVD format workd reat No problems with sound  or image I did notice the Filming  was extremely modified  but I understand this is Madonnas vision and artistry  in  the works so  I aknowledge and respect her and her production team for that  THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS SEEING HER LIVE But  having seen her live 5 times  this  concert format BLEW MW AWAY!!! It is the only way that such intricate detail  could be  apreciated  THIS IS ONE COMPLEX TOUR  and a lot of  work, tecnology, effort  and creativity  went into  producing it This version captures it all The  emotion the fans, the dancers  the lights the musicians  and Madonna shines Bright  in it! ( after all she IS  the Star!)  I highly recommend anyone  even non Madonna fans  to purchase this  concert YOU  WILL NOT REGRET IT! Again  I cannot stress enough the fact  that this is not the same as watching her live  It is a step beyond that in my opinon. Lots of memorable moments! this will go on to be one of her best  documented works  of all times! LOVE IT RECOMEND IT!
B006BGZJJ4|3|I wear through these cables at the rate of about one every six months. I've given up on third party solutions -- haven't found one that lasts as long as the original Amazon version. Still too fragile around the Kindle end. Wires become exposed, then break (or worse, short). I've finally just started keeping a couple of spares on-hand. It's cheaper than replacing the Kindle -- still my favorite reader (although starting to show its processor limits with large book counts).
B00VWQ3LQG|5|Awesome movie that keeps you guessing until the end. Who's telling the truth. Who's who and what's what. Great music and visuals. And the ending blew me away!
B009DH37CY|5|This is one of Queens greatest documentaries it should be enjoyed by all Queen fans all around the world. The best to all!
B008RTE08E|5|How is a band that is literally half dead creating new product?  I don't know.  My husband is a fan and as long as they keep putting it out, he gets it.  or I get it for him as a gift.  Win-win either way
B000021XR5|5|To start off I have to say this is a great album.  I think it's one of Stp's best if not the best.  When I first heard the cd I didn't know what to think and I thought there were alot of filler songs that really didn't matter.  But this is a cd that grows on you and you have to give it a chance otherwise it won't grow on you and you'll feel like you wasted your money.  Songs that do grip you are ones like Sour girl and Down but after a little listening you will find that all the songs are good in different ways.  I will say the way the cd is set up is kind of strange.  Let me explain, There are times you go from a soft melodic song to a hard rock song.  Like I got you and MC5.  Other then that little weirdness this cd is classic.  The more you listen to it the more you will realise it is one of the best Stone Temple Pilots albums ever.
0521008433|5|Let me just say that in response to one of the negative reveiws that this book is not meant to be \\"enjoyed\\". Language learning is by nature \\"dry\\" and to expect to be entertained is silly.<br /><br />This book contains a review of most of the theories about language teaching to 2001, the date of the 2nd edition. It contains a survey of the major trends in twentieth-century language teaching and a survey of alternative approaches and methods and also a survey of current communicative approaches. It also contains an author index and subject index including bibliographies after each chapter.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for any language teacher to develop an understanding of underlying theory and for reference.
0525951113|4|Good read. Glad I bought it.
B000F8O35U|5|Got this for my wife and she absolutely broke down when she saw it. Brought back old memories for her.
B00FATEJYE|5|Takes a lot of space but awesome game. I play on the console too and it makes it a lot better.
B000002H72|5|All the songs on this cd are interesting. You dont hear a single filler. This cd is mad, its so good.
B0025KVLUQ|5|it may be the fifth or so time I've owned this, think I may have had it on cassette originally, and I believe my college roommate may have had the LP, and this was in the 80s .  . .but there is nothing I can say about this that hasn't been said, other than it rocks from beginning to end, and for me tells many stories and feels like a conversation with a friend, and what could finish better than \\"and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\\" ?  this will never fail to be true, and then there is the crystalline, pure Harrison in Here Comes the Sun , and it is alright . . .for the duration of the CD, everything is alright. Love it, have loved it for so long, and will always love it.
B009UWYFFK|5|Good coming of age movie.
B00AZL3PBK|5|Awesome game I love it!!!! Very much like Mario bros for Nintendo :) very fun! :) I would recommend this for any age
B006LSZECO|4|Loved the novel HATED THE ENDING. I was hoping Amy paid for all of the lives she ruined. Really disappointed with the ending.
B00F91H666|5|This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Action packed. The effects are awesome.  A must see movie
B00KA87GCW|1|Too young for me
B005MLOKXA|5|I love the mix of the law, politics and relationship/family story lines.  Great acting & I love the cast and their issues.
B000031EGV|5|Top movie and arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition. thanks.
B002GKQ5MY|5|Watched all six seasons.  At first thought the sex was gratuitous and not true to the life style.  At least not mine anyway.  Just trying to get men/women to watch for the lesbian sex.<br />Almost gave me a feeling like I was watching a mild porno movie.  Gratuitous is the only way I can describe the abundance of sex in the beginning shows.  As a TV director, didn't think it was necessary.  But once the characters were developed and the plot moved forward one realized the power and beauty of friendship and love between not just women but men and women as well.  Then the following shows  became more about people, lifestyles and choices. Not sex.  Moreover I left with the feeling it's not so much as who we love, but that we can love. Sometimes maybe love with sacrifice, but with honesty foremost.
B0017MO10U|5|I love Continuum !!  MGM knows how to back the right production people on this series but have no guts to continue something great! Any other billionaires out there wanna purchase the Stargate franchise?  We need to re-employ these people again!<br />Buy this movie today! It is a dying breed of excellence!!  I want more of this (and yes, I miss all of my SG1 team ~ all 7 of them)
B002YCVX5S|3|It was OK, had 3 story lines overlapping and it simply didn't flow very well. I'd not watch it again for any reason
B007JRU4N0|1|The movie was great, not going to review it here. I am reviewing the streaming experience (first time on Amazon's site). I have it installed on my PS3, which is wirelessly on the internet, hooked with HDMI cable to my Pioneer plasma TV and also with audio cables to my Pioneer stereo receiver. I selected the option for \\"High Definition\\". I got the notice after purchasing the movie that it was assessing my internet speed. I pay for a fast speed from Comcast cable (Xfinity) as I work from home. The assessment finished, and it said it would be able to show the movie in HD. The message said that if it determined that internet speed became insufficient, it would switch to standard definition. Ok. So the movie starts after buffering for awhile, and it looks great, like High Def should. About 25 minutes into the movie, we get a message that bandwidth is insufficient and it wants to switch to standard definition. The issue is that I paid for HD (it's a dollar more). The standard view was almost unwatchable for awhile, then slightly improved to be watchable but noticeably degraded picture. I have watched HD streaming on my Apple TV and had none of these issues. I think I will stick to Apple TV for renting streaming HD movies.
B0094BB4TW|1|This app came with imbedded ad ware that clogged up the screen and created an unnecessary nuisance that infringed on my viewing pleasure.
B005K17RU0|5|I have 2 Aneroid phone with it on them runs great just put it on my kindle 3 weeks ago and it runs even better.
B00DR0PDNE|4|After receiving the first one and testing it out I ended up purchasing another one for my bedroom.  The first one is on our living room near the router.  From what I've read, I tend to agree that performance increases when it's located close to the router.  The one in my bedroom (which isn't too far from the router but still further than the one in the living room) doesn't stream as well; the picture can be a bit choppy.  The one in the living room works great.  Since we have a Roku, we mainly use the Chromecast for Youtube, TheDareWall, stuff like that.  Shows from thedarewall stream seamlessly but movies tend to get a bit choppy.  Not sure why that is.  But at this price, to be able to stream things to your TV instead of watching them on a laptop is definitely worth it.  I use mine every day.
B00A8ECU24|5|So awesome  I love it my friend named allison saw it and she was like get it GET IT I said no am sorry friend am so sorry:) for give me
B000O178BY|2|I like the fact that he has a big concept. I like the cover. I like the intro. Track 2 is ok. Me, I'm Not is good enough. Overall: Disappointment. I think his idea would make a decent movie. This is kinda like I'm watching a movie with no picture and a repetitive soundtrack. It sounds like he created all the music (minus lyrics and concept) on a laptop in about three days.     My real beef, if I can find a way to express it correctly, is I guess the philosophy of reznor's headspace between With Teeth and year zero. I was never into NIN until With Teeth - the track Only was written very well and the last track is awesome. The whole album is quite introspective, and the music varied and fitting. I expected an expansion on the ideological/skeptic/perhaps nihilistic themes with his new album; kinda a continuation from Right Where it Belongs left off. With Teeth felt so honest, it was refreshing. This just feels like Trend Renzor is out being  a reactionary to bush, and jumping on this new wave of bush hatred. I hated bush since after our address to to the UN in 01 - something about that address and everything done after seemed illogical and phony. But feeling like that was oh-so-strange back then. Whatever finally ticked the nation off, be it Katrina or the slow realization that hey, bush has no clue what he's doing and his powerful posse is running the show behind the curtain with their own agendas, i guess now it's bandwagon time to hate all things republican; and you can see many an artist stimulated to create based on this new stirring of anti-bush/anti-hegelian-meets-Rumsfeld&Rove's-Machievellian-politics feelings instead of just doing what they do for the sake of their art. Now, instead of digging deeper into his own psyche, and writing super-introspective lyrics, which would've been a cool follow-up to With Teeth, we got reznor projecting all his energies \\"outwards\\". It's all through other people's eyes as they see all the plagues of society bearing down upon us.No more time for \\"Who am I?\\" and \\"What does my life mean/what is this life for?\\" wonderings. Not in today's choatic times, which have suddenly become so real after Katrina and the new focus of the mass public. Don't look inside and question why we're in the mess we are now; focus on the mess and what it could mean for the future!    My problem is this disc just reminds me of the new wave that seems to have crashed down on the collective conscious of mass culture nowadays, which is trying to spur us to hate bush and use our hate to go and separate ourselves from all things political and fight to regain our individual freedoms on the home front. First it was fight for freedom oversees, now it's a fight for freedom at home. Freedom freedom freedom, and change, change, change; that's what it's all about. Big ideas, and no focus on the self, and the real world, and the question to why we're so driven to embrace these sellable notions of freedom and change and all that in the first place. Why doesn't reznor focus on himself, and the music, and quit fretting over the new bandwagon wave that's hit the music scene? Doesn't he realize that perhaps that was one of the main points of the administration&the war that he's complaining about, to get us to focus our energies on perceived external enemies and the problems outside and struggle with the issues that come with globalization instead of focusing on the world inside and simply doing what you feel is right to you? If we all did that tho, we wouldn't have caused such problems to begin with, because we woulda realized the war and bush seemed fishy and illogical, but whatever, I guess that could just be looked at as a negative aspect of Christian dogma again - take all your internal issues, project them on some random, perceived enemy, and focus all your drive on battling that enemy; then, when you finally realize how bad you f-ed up, repent and whine and [...] and moan until you feel so bad you have to project your demons outagain, and the cycle continues.    Oh well, whatever gives you the drive to push onward, right? Reznor's certainly got that, with his whole crazy marketing scheme. I just wish he quieted his raging mind down a bit, and wrote some more complete and well-rounded introspective music again, and stopped pushing his focus outward. But oh well, whatever appeals to the bandwagon, and business, can't forget business, right? Him and Serj (\\"elect the dead\\") can go on tour now and [...] together while ignoring the fact that their actual music isn't that good.    [...]
B00DR0PDNE|5|Really great for watch the best shows you missed. Just don't have games on it for the kids. But I loved it cause you can watch it on any device and more than one show at a time.
B005WUHAX8|3|Great slim case, however generic IPhone chargers will not fit the access port. I loved the sleek, trim design, but my generic wall & car chargers don't fit.

B007MB5OCE|5|This story is a beautifully comical journey through history with some unforgettable characters fictional and real.  It reminded me of Woody Allen's \\"Zelig\\".
B00CH3DBNQ|4|Malala tells about her experiences in Pakistan. Overall it is very eye opening. Sometimes her little stories make it quite clear the book is written by a teenage girl, however overall this does not distract from the main points of the book.
B00W3V83QW|3|It is okay and a challenge at times.
B00EL8JCGU|5|Awesome movie. That's it's not real. Kept me on the edge of my seat.
6304078102|5|One of the most beautiful films I have seen. Totally overlooked by most reviewers, however, was the magnificent, touching  performance by the beautiful young Jean Louisa Kelly as Rowena. Her presence in the film was a gem of casting; her voice is that of an angel.  She brought me to tears.  And now we find that she is also a fine comedy actress, as witnessed in the new CBS sitcom, &quot;Yes, Dear.&quot;Hopefully, we will see much more of this lovely lady in the future. I am in love.
B00J6YBOFQ|4|Interesting insights into starting and running a business. Matches the author's much-publicized contrarian views.
B00IS87HYI|5|Addictive! Very fun, and you can definitely play for free all the way, if you are patient enough. Setup is like Candy Crush, with levels, and no advancement unless enough pets rescued, or a certain level of points or both. And then, just like Candy Crush, there are the &#34;In order to advance, solve these three levels 24 hours apart or pay.&#34; If you are impatient, I guess you can pay - I'd rather do them one at a time. some level are very challenging, some are easier, so they will keep your interest!<br />Pets are cute.
B011KKCQH8|4|I love sci-fi thrillers.  This one was pretty good, no expense was spared on the special effects.  Good plot and good acting.  My wife was bored to tears with the movie, but I enjoyed it.....female robots, need I say more ?
B00MU9R5OI|4|Good Game and lots of fun!
B00SH00N3Y|1|You will probably go into this movie expecting bad science and good fun. This movie falls short of both of those expectations. It sounds like it was written by a stoner that failed high school chemistry but insists he is a true scientist with an unparalleled grasp of all things. Insufferable. Probably what Scarlett Johansson, from her death bed many years from now, will name as her one real regret.
B00687Q0VC|5|Excellent series.  I learned so much about John Adams.  I now want to read the book that this series was developed from.
0307455874|4|I'm not normally a non-fiction reader, but I thought it would be important to read a little from our president.  I'm glad I pushed myself to be patient with the book because after reading it, I feel like I understand him better.  It's sad that he won't be able to achieve the America he talks about it the book, though.
B00A7OIXW6|5|Good movie, great packaging, usually always happy purchasing items from amazon, especially movies & CDs.  I can always count on a good price, and if I am not happy, returns are simple.
B000UBMWG4|4|I received my Blade Runner set this past week.  I put in Disc 1, the Final Cut, and I think I got the Workprint instead.  I also reviewed Disc 5 and it seemed to be the same as Disc 1.    Disc 1 contains a version where there is no opening credits, but just the dictionary definition of Replicant.  This is the workprint version, correct????    I know this has been a problem in the past (wrong editions on discs) but I thought this was resolved.    I called Warner Brothers and they are sending me the correct disc for the Final Cut, at no charge.    We'll see what happens....
B003XF1XOQ|5|WOW! Spent most of weekend reading. I couldn't put the book down. I found the Hunger Games hard to get into,in fact, I nearly set it aside. I'm glad I persevered and read all of the books.

B0016YBFZ8|5|Its a nice 'glamorized' movie of a  bunch of low life losers.They lie,steal,stab each other in the back,and murder their friends.DeNiro,Pesci and Sorvino we're great.Liotta was outstanding.Matter of fact,the whole cast was Terrific.<br />But facts are facts.Mobs and gangs are suckers.They suck from those of us who 'play by the rules'.<br />I like Reservoir Dogs better.
B00457X7XQ|4|Technically well written and somewhat believable the subject matter is as pertinent today as it was when it was written a couple of years ago.

0790739356|1|After watching stuff that's thrilling and full of details and lush tones like &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; or &quot;Star Wars,&quot; &quot;Soldier&quot; seems too dull. In fact, it's also TOO boring. Never  was I interested in what was happening in this film, I just wanted it to  end. First, we have a cheap script by the writer of, can you believe it?  &quot;Blade Runner!&quot; The story is badly crafted with some  uninteresting characters or characters that we have already seen in  previous films. Kurt Russell is basically wasted in this movie. All he does  is stand around giving people pissed-off looks. He never even gets decent  dialogue! &quot;Soldier&quot; also desperately lacks imagination. All we  get is a desert planet that's just full of trash. Even the desert planet in  the equally dull film, &quot;Stargate,&quot; was more interesting than the  one in &quot;Soldier.&quot; And when there finally is action, it's  predictable and just plain boring. Paul Anderson should have added more,  more to the sad scenery and poor screenplay. We are a culture that starves  for new images like &quot;Dark City,&quot; not boring, unexciting material  like &quot;Soldier.&quot;
B00H6LS59E|4|Five teenagers with nothing in common share a school detention. They are different ages, sexes, colour and from very different backgrounds. They don't even like each other very much. Under normal circumstances there would be no social interaction between these five, despite attending the same school. But unbeknown to them they each share something exceptional and an electrical storm during their detention ignites what in each of them makes them special.<br />As they come to terms with their own uniqueness and learn to control their powers they must also accept each others differences and work as a team.<br />An excellent &#34;awakening&#34; novel. The author has set a strong foundation for the trilogy.<br />Interesting idea, likeable characters and a fast exciting plot all make this a good YA novel.
B00L23SE52|4|Good movie!
B00E8B1358|3|Preposterous plot, great action sequences, mildly endearing characters. Though slightly confusing for those like me who are unaquainted with the comic or 1980s cartoons. Pretty much delivered exactly what I expected and I mean that in a nice way.  Cartoonish violence may be bloodless but I think it should have garnered an R rating.
B005LAIH4A|5|This is a great deal.  You get the blu ray disc and the regular dvd in the package.
B00IS87HYI|5|I really enjoy this game , the only grip I have is the length of time it takes to complete tasks, when you don't have gold bars to automatically move on.

0671027344|4|The life of the protagonist Charlie changes completely during his first year at high school. He makes new friends and with them he enters a new world of parties, sex and drugs. But actually he remains a wallflower and his over-sensitive character suffers from the problems of his family. <BR>Charlie also has his first experiences with girls: His love with Sam doesn't have a chance, because of differences in age, behaviour and thinking. He starts dating Mary Elizabeth, but it is not true love. <BR>In a play he decides to show his real feelings and hurts nearly all his friends. This event marks the turning point of the story, because you ask yourself if he remains together with Mary Elizabeth or if he comes together with Sam. <BR>The book consists of Charlie's letters to an unknown friend. By means of them you can imagine his feelings very good. <BR>However, you only look at each event through his eyeglasses. <BR>But on the whole we can recommend this very intimate book because of its tension and interesting report of growing-up.

B001GZ6QC4|5|A strong, water-tight follow-up to \\"Batman Begins\\" as only Christopher Nolan could deliver.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" reunites Nolan and Christian Bale, who once again dons the cape and cowl of Batman in his ongoing war against crime. Returning to the fold, as well, is Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon who enlists additional aid in the guise of Gotham's daring new District Attorney Harvey Dent. Dent, portrayed impeccably by the incomparable Aaron Eckhart, is hellbent on bringing down as many crime-lords as he possibly can. That campaign is quickly and boldly challenged by a rising criminal mastermind known only as \\"The Joker,\\" who aims to thrust Gotham City into ceaseless chaos and force its brooding Caped Crusader into crossing that fine line between praised hero and reviled vigilante.<br /><br />Make no mistake. This is every bit as gripping and character-driven as its immediate predecessor. You have Christopher Nolan's masterful storytelling coupled, once again, with the outstanding talents of a first-rate cast nobody could even remotely request any better of. The standout performance here, it should go without saying, is that of the late Heath Ledger. Forget everything you already know about Jack Nicholson's legendary Joker performance. Mr. Ledger takes the character to a brand new level of disturbing realism that no film in this franchise has ever previously explored. It's equal parts dramatic and, at some points, downright creepy. He really knocked it out of the park.<br /><br />The overall tone of this movie is what ultimately makes it so very satisfying. It's dark, it's moody, and as with \\"Batman Begins,\\" it never once delves into the realm of corny candy-coated kitsch. This is straight-ahead, pull-no-punches action from start to finish.<br /><br />And, if you're any type of fan, you shouldn't be disappointed in the slightest.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" hits the bullseye, squarely and decisively.
B00005JPNZ|3|There's a moment in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls\\" where I had what I would call \\"pulp bumps\\".  In other words, that tingling sensation you feel when you're in the midst of a really good boyhood adventure (the type you want to read by flash light under the covers after bedtime).  It's at the beginning. Soviet soldiers have infiltrated a top secret military compound and their captive is non other than our old friend, Dr. Henry Jones Jr.. After 19 years our hero is grizzlier and gravel-voiced, but still packs a solid punch.  Our villain is a dangerous dominatrix played deliciously by Cate Blanchett who tells Jones he is needed to find the whereabouts of a crate with mysterious magnetic powers; something out a 1950's sci-fi serial.  The commies cock their weapons, John Williams' majestic music swells up, and for one brief and shaken movement I felt I was back in time to the year 1981; I felt I was back in an INDIANA JONES movie.    Well, moments are fleeting.    By the time Shia LeBuf is introduced as \\"Mutt Williams,\\" a pugnacious motorcycle riding greaser who is in actuality...(c'mon, you know), \\"Crystal Skull\\" becomes the Indiana Jones movie I feared would huff and puff its way back into our popular culture. Grand, funny, and exciting in spots- tired and in need of a nap in others.  Okay, perhaps I'm shooting for the obvious with the 60-something triumvirate of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford all trying for one last hurrah. And face it- there is no way that these movie giants can equal the magic of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" but at the very least the filmmakers could give us a damned good story and, unfortunately, \\"Crystal Skulls\\" is a dull one.    All the great movie serials and adventure yarns had what Alfred Hitchcock called, \\"Maguffins,\\" i.e. things that would spark the story but in the end would be unimportant for audiences to enjoy the fun.  In \\"Raiders,\\" the hook was immediate- the Nazis are after the Lost Ark of the Covenant, Jones must find it first.  Bang!  We're off and running!  Here we are never quite sure what a \\"Crystal Skull\\" is and why we should care about anybody obtaining it (in the hands of Ford it actually looks like some weird ice sculpture lifted off someone's buffet table).  Indy and Mutt are locked in the position of having to explain the what, where, and why of this thing over and over again as they dig through the \\"been-there/done-that\\" cob webs and corpses.      ...and the CGI effects are again a bust.  The craftsmanship is gone.  We all remembered that giant ball in \\"Raiders\\" partly because is WAS a giant ball.  \\"Crystal Skulls'\\" computer tricks, despite their state of the art innovation,  lack a palpable depth.  It looks fake and oddly surreal. When Indy and company are besieged by a swarm of killer insects I looked on indifferently- I wasn't seeing real creepy insects but something made possible by a massive hard drive.    Few bright spots are the return of Indiana Jones' long lost soul mate Marion (the ageless Karen Allen). Ford's glee is priceless when he first spots her but David Keop's screenplay waits far too long to bring her into the mix.  Another is a bone fide fabulous action set piece involving what Indiana Jones does best- jumping to and from speeding vehicles and other assorted hair-raising near misses.  Even the classy Blancett gets down and dirty.  Who knew?    Harrison Ford is solid back in Lucas/Spielberg territory.  After having to take ridiculous pot shots by internet fan boys about his age, Ford is very appealing in the same way we can appreciate the craggy beauty of a Clint Eastwood or a John Wayne.  I also found poignant the way his meek professorial alter ego looked more and more like the beloved old school master from \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips.\\"     It's glad to have you back, Mr. Jones.  We've missed you. But if you do return (as the ending implies), please bring with you an interesting story next time.  And perhaps, maybe a giant ball or two.

B001GUXJQA|4|I liked the honesty in dealing with personalities that may have not been too pleasant, even in a highly protected work environment (CYA syndrome) as a police force.  Lie, cheat and steal to get ahead.  It happens in most places with career oriented people.  The only thing that bothered me was the mystery surrounding Moore's wife.  The end of the book kind of left that relationship with Bosch hanging out there.  I almost felt like she was guilty of something. . . .maybe she was and we were meant to think that.

B006TTC5O0|5|\\"Well, I've wrestled with reality for 35 years, doctor, and I'm happy to state I finally won out over it.\\"<br /><br />That cheerful comment sets the tone for \\"Harvey,\\" a movie about a lovable guy whose way of dealing with the harshness of reality is simple: Make his own. It sounds either alarming or overly precious, but the brilliant performances of James Stewart, Josephine Hull and the rest of the cast give it a strangely sunny, heartfelt charm.<br /><br />Veta Louise Simmons (Josephine Hull) hopes to arrange a wonderful marriage for daughter Myrtle May (Victoria Horne) in the upper echelons of society. There's one problem: her wealthy brother Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) has an imaginary pal, a six-foot-three rabbit called Harvey. After Elwood accidently wrecks a party by introducing Harvey to everyone, Veta decides to have him committed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when Veta takes Elwood to the sanatorium, the staff come to think that the fluttery socialite is crazy, and is trying to get her sunny brother out of the way. So they lock her up, and let him go. After that mistake is straightened out, the psychiatric staff and Elwood's long-suffering family try to find him.... and Harvey.<br /><br />If we ever saw Elwood P. Dowd (\\"Here, let me give you one of my cards\\") in a car, the bumper sticker would probably say, \\"Reality is highly overrated.\\" The big theme of the movie is that reality can be harsh, and that it's not necessarily a bad thing to lapse out of it into the fantasies of our own minds. If Elwood isn't dangerous and is otherwise normal, who cares if he has an imaginary friend?<br /><br />Is Harvey real? The film leaves that up to our imaginations. And in the end, it doesn't matter if Harvey is a figment of Elwood's imagination, or a friendly spirit. It's the effect he has on Elwood that is important. His presence makes Elwood happy and relaxed, and Elwood makes others happy and relaxed -- even the hard-boiled head of the psychiatric ward, who lies down on his own couch and tells his secrets to Elwood.<br /><br />This actually isn't too screwballish a comedy -- sure, there's the running joke where Elwood politely introduces Harvey to people he meets. And the scene where Veta is committed is hilarious. But it's more of a heartwarmer than a comedy, from Elwood softening the lead shrink to Myrtle May finding love with a lovable blue-collar worker from the sanatorium.<br /><br />James Stewart gives a wonderfully dreamy performance, slightly smelling of booze and flowers -- his Elwood P. Dowd is mild-mannered, sweet, gallant, courteous, and oh-so-pleasant. And he's learned the value of just enjoying the little things in life, like a flower, a beer or a talk with a friend. And Josephine Hull brings up a brilliant performance as his frazzled sister, with several other good actors rounding off the supporting cast.<br /><br />Who is crazier -- the happy man with the imaginary rabbit, or the people who want him to be 100% sane and less happy? You make the call. With a sweet, surreal story and a flawless cast \\"Harvey\\" is one of those rare movies that does an unspecifiable number on your heartstrings.This actually isn't too screwballish a comedy -- sure, there's the running joke where Elwood politely introduces Harvey to people he meets.

B00H1KX87E|5|Anya's Story by Author Julia Gousseva<br /><br />Talented Author Julia Gousseva has done it again! She has penned another captivating novel for both the young and older reading audience. It is chockfull of a combination of Russian history and romance which is bound to capture the interest of the most discerning readers who enjoy this genre.<br /><br />Best friends, Anya and Katia are finishing up their last year of high school in Moscow and are enjoying their time together before their new life commences as college students. Anya's boyfriend Victor, is off to navy military school in Leningrad to fulfill his dream of working on a submarine. As he embarks on this career choice, Anya already misses him as his arduous training will occupy him for five years. The first two years are the most vigorous and they will not be able to fulfill their dream of marrying and spending the rest of their lives together as planned, at least not for some time in the near future.<br /><br />On the home front, Anya's parents decide to entertain some old friends that they haven't seen for years. They come over to enjoy a meal and bring their now, twenty-one year old son with them. Yuri, is also a trainee at the military academy in Leningrad. However, due to his more senior status, when Anya and Katia go to Victor's oath taking ceremony, it is Yuri who has the time to show them the sights.<br /><br />Anya....the protagonist in this descriptive and charming novel is forced to face great disappointment and what she considers to be betrayal from Victor, the love of her life. In her innocence and naivety, she is extremely hurt by what appears to be Victor's duplicity and finds much solace and comfort in the open arms of Yuri. They share a warm friendship before Yuri unexpectantly proposes to the much surprised and somewhat confused Anya. She sees no reason to refuse and accepts his proposal. They marry a few short months later. After graduation, Yuri is posted at a northern military base, Vidayevo in Murmansk, where Anya discovers the friendship of a lovely couple from Georgia.<br /><br />When Yuri gets his first assignment...a three month stint on the submarine K-626, Anya continues with her correspondence courses. When she returns to Moscow to write her exams, she contacts her dear friend Katia and has the opportunity to share a fun-filled time with her, her husband Evgeni, and some of their old high school friends. Unbeknownst to Anya, Victor arrives with one of his naval academy friends, Fyodor.  When Fyodor and Anya have a few moments alone, he inadvertently shares a story with her about Victor and Yuri that has lasting and irreversible ramifications...<br /><br />I absolutely loved this fictional novel. Author Julia Gousseva's writing style is wonderfully refreshing....no sexually explicit scenes....no cursing...just great old-fashioned story telling....a gifted raconteur at her best. She adeptly pens a realistic story that reaches out from the written page and grabs at the heartstrings in an indescribable and heart wrenching way. I enjoyed every word of this novel and I could literally not put it down. I especially love this quote from the book and feel it needs to be shared. It's about the special bell that Anya kept as a memento of her grandmother's words...\\"Bells keep our souls alive, revive us, and remind us that life always moves forward\\".  Now Anya, at such a young age and with all her past trials and tribulations, must heed this sage advice.<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00EGPIZS4 I'm Not Perfect and It's Okay]]evo in Murmansk, where Anya discovers the friendship of a lovely couple from Georgia.<br /><br />When Yuri gets his first assignment...a three month stint on the submarine K-626, Anya continues with her correspondence courses.

B0064MPXFA|5|very entertaining but at the same time make you stay tuned over and over in every chapter
B004FGMDOQ|5|I really loved this book, the story is fresh and the characters are great. I love the premise of the book that your wacky and shunned family stories may turn out to be true. The time travel aspect and the peculiar children themselves made it a really enjoyable read. I read the book in a few days and then read it's successor &#34;Hollow City&#34; which was just as captivating. I'm looking forward to the third book.
B000FCKGPC|5|This book is great, has all the awesome twists, just have to get used to it. The character split between four and find is confusing but worth while , I'm ready to reread five again
B005ZOBNOI|5|Easy, comfortable read.  Love the voice of the book.  Yes a little sad but I loved the characters.  My daughter died 15 years ago of cancer at the age of 9 and I wasn't turned off my the subject or the story.  My daughter and I keep trying to see the movie at a theater before we have to break down and watch it at home.  We want the movie theater experience.

B00DMCV7K0|4|was a very good written book characters are very easy to follow was so realistic you can put yourself in their places easily
B0002XH9Z4|3|The box set is incomplete through and through. I would've thought that since Sony came out with it, that it would include all of his hits from his early days in Jackson 5 all the way up to now; it doesn't. It doesn't include all of the duets he did as part of the Jackson 5 and solo such as \\"Say Say Say\\", \\"Muscles\\" which he wrote and \\"Somebody is Watching Me\\" which he also co wrote. It doesn't include more of the Jackson 5 hits which is pretty much disrespectful since he had more hits in that group than solo, it briefly skims over the Jacksons hits which is a bit of a save since the Jacksons was just a stopping point for Michael. Its good that they have all that unreleased stuff but at this point in time, it doesnt matter unless Epic/Sony is telling us something that we don't know; Is Michael's career over?. It doesn't include \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"Lady of My Life\\" which are important soul tracks. It doesn't include \\"Scream\\" the only duet he did with Janet which also makes the Box fall short. It doesn't include any of the songs in their Moonwalker versions which is another issue since we all grew up watching that. It would've been a complete box if they also gave us more that we remember from Michael as well as the unreleased material which really was used to fill in the discs in my opinion. Michael deserves way more respect than that when it comes to a box set.
B008Q0D32S|1|I couldn't stay with it to see what happened. It was like watching paint dry. Painfully slow. Didn't like it.

1401370470|2|Dear Mitch –<br /><br />I enjoyed your earlier works, both fiction and non-fiction.  “The Time Keeper” contains much of what made those books great.  Easy-to-read, but not dumbed-down.  A narrative that is comforting, uplifting, and touching.  Characters that we quickly care about.  The only thing missing is that spark of originality that made those other works unique, and prevents this book from rising to the level of the others.<br /><br />How many times can we see the “paranormal being shows our main characters an alternate world”?  Charles Dickens did the “after you’re dead” scenario in “A Christmas Carol”, and while that may – MAY – have been a fresh concept in the late 1800s, it’s been done to death by now.  That concept’s cousin – the “World Where You Never Were” – has been cloned and adapted since Clarence guided George Bailey in “It’s a Wonderful Life”.  I am not saying that it is not possible for a talented writer to manage to find a fresh angle to either of those scenarios; I AM saying that you are a talented writer who was not able to do so.<br /><br />Taken entirely on its own merits, the book is a pleasant diversion with some lessons for all of us.  Unfortunately, those lessons needed a fresh morality tale to help pass them on to a world that can sorely use them, rather than the “been there, done that” feeling that this reader got from your text.<br /><br />I hear your next book was just released … please rest assured that I **AM** looking forward to it!<br /><br />Your friend,<br /><br />Andrew<br /><br />p.s. RATING: 2.5 stars, rounded down to 2 stars
B0044FEZBM|4|Bolshoi Ballet - Flames of Paris    To break it down into simplest terms, this is a beautiful and exciting ballet, and with Vasiliev and Osipova in the starring roles, there is really no way you can go wrong.     As a ballet, Ratmansky's choreography combines the best elements of contemporary and classical into one. At first glance, you won't notice really any contemporary elements in the ballet; the dancers are all in classical costumes, girls in pointe shoes, and men performing their typical feats of virtuosity. However, the pace of the ballet is moved along significantly by the flow of scenes from one to the next. In the first half of the ballet, there are no divertissements, no grande pas de deux, no time consuming entrees or variations. Everything flows quickly, moving the story along and creating a clear exposition.     The only possible flaw in Ratmansky's beautiful and sweeping choreography is the loss of pace in the second half of the ballet. After experiencing the torrential whirlwind of movement in the first half, it's a bit surprising to see things slow down after intermission. However, the divertissements are so brilliantly danced and choreographed that it seems almost a crime to dislike the change.    Natalia Osipova, petite pistol of the Bolshoi, is made for the role of Jeanne. Her dynamo technique and absolutely unrestrained passion convince the viewer immediately that she is indeed a strong peasant girl with the fires of youth burning brightly. Any entrance Osipova makes onto the scene is immediately noticeable; beyond her incredible jumps and technique, she emits a magnetism that is difficult--if not impossible--to ignore. Her technique shines brightest in the final act's grande pas de deux; Osipova seems to not only match, but outshine her partner's incredible jumps. My only regret is that we do not see more of Osipova in the ballet. Granted, ballets ought not be transformed to be vehicles for star; but I found myself wanting more of Jeanne.    Lead ballerina aside, the other three stars of this production do a fantastic job of displaying a smoothness and plasticity of technique and pulling you into their stories. Denis Savin plays the fragile and emotional Jerome with a tenderness often difficult for male dancers to portray. Nina Kaptsova matches him beautifully, and the love story between Jerome and Adeline is, as a relationship, more interesting than that of Jeanne and Phillipe (Osipova and Vasiliev.) Perhaps the scene stealer of this particular production is the nimble and dazzling dancer portraying Armida in the grande divertissement of the party scene. Seldom can a divertissement so long and detailed not feel like an interruption in the story; however, the stunning spectacle of this one makes it one of the brightest and best parts of the ballet. Where Osipova and Vasiliev dazzle with virtuosity, the spirit of Russian ballet and its delicacy and Imperial heritage shine through in the divertissement.    Overall this DVD is one absolutely worth owning for all ballet lovers and watchers. It is also, in my opinion, a fantastic way to introduce someone to ballet. The story is bright and quick, the dancing exciting, and the setting well known.
B00BATG18K|5|No spoilers, but I can say there were three places in the book where I had to grab Kleenex. I love how she layers her characters in such a realistic way, while making you feel you are immersed in the history. My only complaint is I wish we would have spent more time in San Francisco with Lucretia after she returned<br /><br />An absolute gem of a book.

B00AK0X5VQ|3|This game is beautifully designed and challenging, but it failed to hold my attention for very long.  It is good for a momentary time waster, but I don't think it would have a high replay value.
0316228532|1|Let me begin by saying I LOVED the Harry Potter books!  Rowling created a fanciful world in those books in which one could lose oneself.  Her language was so rich, and she painted such amazing word pictures in such deep hues.  She brought children's books back into the category of literature.  So it is with GREAT disappointment that after forcing myself through almost half of The Casual Vacancy, I close it and give up; I will not and cannot finish this book.  Boring, boring, BORING.  There is not one character in this book (and there are probably too many to choose from) that I remotely begin to like.  The language feels forced; the word pictures are dingy at best.  If this books paints a picture of the English countryside and its people, I don't want to visit.  (If I could give it no stars, I would.  But they won't publish without at least one.)  Can I have my money back?????

Then you might be so computer illiterate that you could enjoy this game.<br /><br />The object of this game is to touch two different pictures in the vague hope that you might get a new picture.  When you do, you can then use that picture to combine with your old ones to make still others.  Oh the joy!  Rapture!<br /><br />Personally, I quickly discovered that the most efficient use of my time was to match each picture item by item until something new popped up.  There was no rhyme or reason to it.  Just keep clicking until something happens.  By that point, I was about 30 minutes into the game and made the decision to delete it never to look back.  And now I have written this review so that you need not suffer.  Aren't I nice?
B0025T65GC|5|I had a major musical identity crisis growing up, especially when it came to picking a band or person I really liked.  Devin Townsend has been the person that stands out above of anything else I have listened to.  Every album he does is different, but he keeps his Devy signature there.  Ki without a doubt is no different, being the album to date that is way different than anything else he has ever done, it proves that Devin Townsend is one of the few people out there that creates music that is original and new every time a new album is released unlike other bands that fall into the same genre with Devin.    Ki is a first of four albums under 'The Devin Townsend Project' plus this is first album being sober and it's very noticeable.  His style has obviously changed, plus the clean tone guitar is something that gives the album it's own stand alone sound.  The album plays on self control, something that Devin himself has learn and explained in his radio interview, every time you think this record will lose its composure, it takes a breath and let's it go.  But there are some very 'chill' songs on the record like \\"Terminal\\" \\"Ain't Never Gonna Win\\" \\"Winter\\" and \\"Lady Helen\\" that are soothing enough to make you doze off while you listen.    The record itself can leave you hanging if you are looking for something that will rock out at some point, because it won't.  Ki is instead an introduction to what Devin has now become, a sober and brilliant artist with a whole new side to show us.  If you have been listening to Devin over the years, you will appreciate this album for what it is.
B000065V42|5|Was so happy when my grandson asked for this movie since he is only 7. He was so excited to receive it. Has watched it many times over.
B004UPALT6|5|I always loved the Evil Dead movies. the DvD plays very well and I'm able to enjoy the craziness of horror and comedy combined.
B009FZFONO|5|And the actors. This is one of two TV series I have found in years worth watching. Keeps me thinking.
B000FS9FCG|1|This film has a female protagonist who does nothing but have all her agency taken from her by various men so that the character V can live an absurd masculine egalitarian power fantasy.  The climax is a poorly-choreographed, poorly-shot train wreck of a fight in which no one survives because higher body count = more gritty realism.  There are some good, important political ideas in this film, but the philosophy in general should not be taken seriously.
B0058EBNAO|5|This is by far the best weather application out. There is so many options for this app. I like all of the available information that I have at my fingertips with this app. I have tried many other weather apps out there, but each and every time I find myself comparing them all to this one, and each of the others seem to always miss something.
B005DD7JL2|3|The fight scenes were well done but the story had work to do. Also the Main villain of the video game is smaller then in the video game and doesn't fight in the movie at all. Could've stuck more to the video game story, which in it's own right is pretty good.
B000002KY8|5|Awesome Classic album from the 80's, in my opinion 1999 and Purple Rain were his best albums.
B004HZ76FQ|4|It's fun to play...I guess as close to fishing as you can get in a get in a game.  Sometimes it seems kind of random.
B005V2EVBQ|3|This case is convenient and light weight.  Even tho I wish it were more sturdy, it was worth the money I paid for it.  It's a bit hard to keep it propped up while viewing videos, whoever, once you figure out a way to keep it propped there are no problems.  Over all, I like the product, but wish I had spent more for the sturdier case.
B00A3NQNUU|2|It won't load when I try to play it all it says is we will fix the problem but the problem never gets fixed otherwise it's a pretty good game
B00FB13Y74|5|It's a really fun game and it's smart and clever and funny so that's why I give this 5 stars
B008476HBM|5|My favorite Jane Austen by far! And so convenient to read on my iPad! How happy I was to find a free copy on Amazon!
B005LJETYI|5|Sakurazaka has created a world deep in detail and visceral.  The characters are alive, you get to know and like them.  The description of action is detailed and vigorous.  As someone who likes to escape the real world with his reading I found this story well worth the time.
B0014VPFTA|5|Amazing!
B00005JNJT|5|The film basically follows a plot of focusing mainly on Bruce Wayne. The other 4 films directed by Burton and others focused mainly on the villans and gave The Bat a backseat. Well, now Batman  now has his own movie. The first part is where Bruce Wayne's origins, and follows how he got to where he was and why. The second part follows the devolopment of his alter-ego, Batman. The third part is less plot developed, but packs a solid action punch. The third and second part focus on Batman's pursuit of Scarecrow.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece. Instead of putting Batman in the backseat like previous directors had, He has created basically a tribute to Batman, focusing on his life and emergence. He also adds his own style and darkness to the film, making it a lot better than the animated style of Burton. He makes Batman more realistic and helps us see how exactly Batman formed. The effects were supurb, and I had a fun time watching this fantastic film.<br /><br />In closing, I thought this was the film that everybody has been waiting for.  Batman fans have been waiting a long time to rejoice over the story of their hero, Batman. He has been put in the back seat too much. This was his moment to shine, and by god, he has been given the proper film for it! Fantasic film!
B00BEZTMQ8|1|I bought this disc thinking that it was a &#34;digital&#34; copy that could be downloaded to iTunes, where I keep ALL my movies.

0446677450|4|It was OK
B005K01VZS|5|This is an absolutely wonderful story of Mitch Albom's faith journey, a journey that snuck up on him. Have recommended to numerous people already.
B008XX6J4C|5|These guys are so inventive and we can't get enough of them. Very different, but wonderful music. Hope we hear more of them!
B002BSHXJA|5|Like many other Beatles fans, I started off by grabbing the complete set of STEREO REMASTERS the day they went on sale in Sept.....Unfortunately, I was unimpressed with several of the stereo mixes....PLEASE PLEASE ME...WITH THE BEATLES...RUBBER SOUL...REVOLVER....Immediately turned me off..That \\"vocals/right-music/left\\" technique just didn't do it for me.  .and after a second listen....I found myself  growing ever more unpleased with SGT PEPPER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR...<br /><br />So I ran out and grabbed this selection.....The MONO REMASTERS....and am extremely enthusiastic about my purchase.  I actually prefer the MONO versions of everything up to the WHITE ALBUM...I have mixed emotions about the stereo versus the mono WHITE ALBUM....After several listenings of the MONO version, I find it has a much fuller sound than the stereo.<br /><br />An historical note:  Back in the days before stereo...MONO (or Monaural as it is called) was actually HIGH FIDELITY and was preferred my many audio enthusiasts because of it's exceptional dynamics...Stereo was dismissed as a passing fad and gimmick that took away from the musical performance.<br /><br />The MONO sound quality is fantastic...very smooth highs...and not harsh like the early cd issues...deeper, more natural bass tones....wider dynamic range....You can actually hear alot of detail in the vocals and music now.  The mono mix just has a stronger, fuller sound overall...Another quality is the very consistent sound from cd to cd..<br /><br />As far as the Stereo versions....I would grab .PAST MASTERS...ABBEY ROAD...LET IT BE and LET IT BE NAKED (as the latter 3 aren't available in mono)...and if you pick up a copy of HOLLYWOOD BOWL and the BBC...That would probably pretty well complete your Beatles collection.<br /><br />I guess the hard core Beatles fans will do what I did and just go buy the complete sets of both....as both have their own merits.<br /><br />If your budget is limited..then..most definitely...go MONO
B0089LOG02|5|It is definitely a page turner. Beautifully written with a balance of emotions. It was intense & something I got immedi
B002APS61I|4|Nicely summarized version of the book with great soundtrack and great cinematography.  Would recommend.
B000075BFK|5|These album of 2Pac is one of the most excellent audio tapes he ever recorded. I heard already the album and you better buy it, cuz its a fantastic album and real. Not remakes of other artist but you will hear him and other artist. <br />He'll return in 2003.
0316225932|5|great I love bosch stories
B000FC1AGG|5|In the end it was just such a great ending. I was able to go to bed with a nice little smile on my face for the first time in a few days. Overall Can You Keep A Secret? is just a nice little heart warming read that will leave you happy at the end of it. Even though the book clocks in at just a little over 380 pages it didn’t feel like it at all. The story flows really well and I would have never guessed it was this long. In fact I wish it had been longer. I love long books, but I love them even more when they’re done and I find myself wishing for more.laugh at all their antics.<br /><br />Even though Can You Keep A Secret? is most certainly a rom-com there were moments of suspense. Around 85% just when I was thinking things were bad you get this feeling that you know they are about to get a whole lot worse. I wanted to strangle a certain character in this book, ahhh. Some people just don’t listen and others are way too trusting. I found myself simultaneously pleading to not let it happen and yelling at Emma to take off the rose colored glasses because we all saw this coming.<br /><br />In the end it was just such a great ending.

B0063GORYU|5|I have not found any problems with this game only my usual addiction of not being able to put it down.
B0017SWPXY|3|It is well written for the most part I just started to scan whenever he began listing race car drivers...what they did.. driving techniques....otherwise entertaining
B004H4XAXO|5|The scope of Jordan or Tolkien with an emotional and inspirational connection with readers. Loved it.<br /><br />Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.
B009CGR9S4|5|This is a great movie and something that you can watch over and over.
B00000IQV6|5|This a a great, moving, true story of a down-to-earth medical student with a big heart and the right motives for becoming a doctor.  I hope every doctor watches this movie.
B00LSWU1A8|5|Fresh, yet back to the roots. Amazingly straightforward, yet rich album. Chapeau, Jackson!
B000002OX7|5|It's been almost thirty years, and this album still hasn't been topped. Some of the added songs are good, but the original album's nine songs are the most perfect studio rock album of all time.  Nothing by the Beatles,  the Stones, Zeppelin, Floyd, Dylan, Clapton, Hendrix, or anyone else can  top this masterpiece.  You cannot call yourself a rock-an-roll fan unless  you have this album.  Every original song is simply great.  Hardly anyone  ever mentions Goin' Mobile, and it may be the the lightest of the songs of  the album, but I love it just as much as the others.  &quot;Watch the  po-lice and the tax-man miss me, I'm mo-bile.&quot;  I love that line.   Needless to say, there are many other great lines as well.  As much as I  love the Beatles (and Zeppelin, and Floyd), it's never gotten any better  than this album.
B000002KAT|4|Good stuff
B00IVFC6QC|5|This item was perfect, the box was a little crushed, but the camper is cute and my grandaughter loves it
0812589041|5|The book Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, is an action filled, thrilling yet emotional science fiction novel.  The book is about one little boy named Ender Wiggin who is the third child in his family and a genious along with his older sister Valentine and brother Peter.  Ender Wiggin is specially chosen out of the rest of his siblings to go into the military and train to fight off the buggers, who are aliens from a different planet who attacked Earth years earlier.  The military training is not just any average army- it takes place in space.  Ender, only being six years old, turns out to be the best at all the military games.  At a young age, he manages to beat older kids of 12 or 13 years.  Although Ender is the best at the games, he is not a happy child.  Ender not only misses his family, mostly his sister Valentine, but he is also picked on constantly at Battle school.  Soon enough, Ender is transferred to a school where he is one of the youngest boys.  Now at the age of 10, Ender is trained by Mazer who was the one who saved Earth from the buggers years ago.  Mazer worked Ender day and night- hardly leaving Ender and time to sleep let alone relax.  As Ender wins every battle on the video games he is commander of, he suprisingly saves Earth.  The entire time Ender fought battles on the video games, he was being fooled- it was real.  The ending of the book becomes very intense and the suprise at the end is amazing.  I highly reccomend this book to anyone- even if you've never read Science-fiction before!!!!
B000AARKW6|5|It works great and it was not damaged or broken. I was very happy with this purchase just great. Thanks.
B00000294R|5|Having made a name for himself as a guest MC on D.I.T.C. (Diggin' in the Crates) projects such as Diamond D.'s Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop and Showbiz & A.G.'s Runaway Slave, the flamboyantly gifted Lamont Coleman (aka Big L) dropped his debut in early 1995. A product of the mean streets of Harlem, L made his bones in the rap game with his rapid fire freestyle delivery and clever punchline-peppered rhymes. A patchwork album with a few outstanding cuts, Lifestylez fails to package the lightning-in-a-bottle talent of this cut-above MC. The album showcases L as a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire. The lead track, \\"Put It On\\" produced by Kid Capri, is a party cut with a criminal attitude. \\"M.V.P.\\" snatches a brief segment from DeBarge's \\"Stay With Me\\" (later aggrandized on the Notorious B.I.G.'s popular remix of \\"One More Chance\\"). \\"Da Graveyard\\" features a young Cam'ron (here Killa Kam) and most notably a superb verse from a pre-Jigga Jay-Z (at the outset of his solo career). With better production and marketing, Big L might have found himself with a platinum album but instead he settled for platinum respect. This album captures the dynamic potential of a street legend, a legend who would later be gunned down in his prime. This is definately the most under rated rap album i know , and Big l arguably the best lyricall rapper too ever grace the mic. but too bad the world would never really know , this would be his only album he recorded. (The Big Picture LP was never fully recorded bye L it was just a bunch of underground stuff he recorded mashed together , was pretty good but still wasent really his real shidd) R.I.P. BIG L
B0054TKAZW|5|Love this series!
0399213015|5|This TINY little book is a classic, of course.  My kids love reading it and now that they are starting to read on their own, it's a favorite.
B005LW5J9O|4|I enjoyed the history it contained.  However, He stopped before I anticipated he would.  Expected more dialogue.  I also did not expect that about half the book would be footnotes, bibliography etc.
B004ALIKKC|5|Jon, Richie and the boys just simply put out good old fashioned ROCK N ROLL !  If you don't purchase this,it's your loss !  Rock on Bon Jovi...the real deal !
B005LJKEXS|5|Seems to be very good quality and works well when tethering my Canon camera to my computer to view the pictures in Lightroom. Hook up the computer to a HD TV and you can really get a handle on what the images look like and adjust for mistakes on the fly. I'm not strapped to a short 15 feet like I had been which gives me more flexibility to move around. I tried a longer extension USB wire but found that the signal just didn't make it all the time to the computer. Haven't had any issues with this one so far!
B00C7KXUOE|5|At first I thought this series was a prequel to the books and movies. It turns out to be a very artful reboot, neither a slave to the source materials, nor stumbling over itself to carve out its uniqueness. References to the original stories are seamless and simply exist as a part of the whole. They neither attempt to contrast the originals nor pay obeisance to them. The series simply is what it is.<br /><br />This isn't a simple forensic mystery show. The characters' lives, psychology, and motivation are woven into the tale at every level. The show is intelligent, handles psychology well even when pushing its credibility, and integrates human culture and philosophy into a lens through which we see the events.<br /><br />Hugh Dancy gives a flawless performance as the tortured but determined investigative psychologist. And while I had to get used to Madds Mikkelsen as Lecter, after a few episodes I was actually ready to say his performance is far better, and that he portrays a sociopath more convincingly, than did Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />This Lecter is more complicated than the interpretations we've seen in the past. He's cold and cunning, highly cultured, lacking any natural empathy, but still seems to need people in a certain way that actual sociopaths really do. But his self control is nearly constant, and much is communicated simply by the smallest of his facial expressions and his cultivated movements and gestures.<br /><br />I was already a big fan of the previous Thomas Harris movie adaptations, but the Hannibal series places the franchise on a much higher level.
B00BAXFECK|4|Struggled through this book just because I wanted to see how it ended. I don't recommend it.
B008PZYLEI|3|Good movie...needed a little more of a story for me.
B000003TAW|5|One of the greatest albums of the 1990's! Starting out heavy with My Name is Jonas and finishing elegantly with Only in Dreams.  This has to be my 3rd copy I have bought due to others getting scratched.
B004WDRT1Y|5|No matter how many times one has seen this wonderful film, one more time is still terrific entertainment! And to watch it in 3D just made it that much more special.
0385495315|5|I had heard of this book on Slashdot, but I was unprepared for such a well-written, enticing story.  I was drawn in from the beginning, and loved almost all of the book (the section on dead languages was a bit dry).  I learned a lot about how cryptography works, and more importantly, what is wrong with other methods besides public key encryption.<br />This is a great book.  All my friends who have borrowed it loved it too.
B000B5MI3Q|5|With the number of competitors out there in the dive watch style category the Seiko 007 is hard to beat at the given price point - under $200.  Attractive and customizable, it's worth serious consideration.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|great writing and great story telling. not terribly deep but kept my interest through to the end.  now I want to read the next one by moriarty.

0385335997|4|I absolutely DEVOURED Outlander, but I thought Gabaldon really lost her tough in Dragonfly in Amber. It was too long, too much detail and too historic. Because I loved Outlander so much I thought I really had to give Gabaldon one more chance, and I am so glad I did.  The magic of Outlander is completely recreated in Voyager. The spark between Jamie and Claire is there, and the war and history of Scotland is secondary to the main plot line, where it belongs. I absolutely love the addition of Brianna as a character and am so relieved that Claire is back with Jamie where she belongs. After reading about these characters for over 2000 pages, it was amazing to see how their lives have changed 20 years later. I love the men that Fergus and young Ian have grown into, and I love the family that Jenny and Ian have created.  One thing I will say though, is that I agree with other readers who say that it is a bit unnecessary for Jamie to get into some kind of trouble in every.single.situation. Gabaldon has the poor guy basically fighting for his life, or Claires every time he uses a chamberpot. The crazy situations are a bit overdone, but I still really enjoyed this novel and can NOT wait to get my hands on the 4th installment.
B0050DIWFC|5|excellent read
0374533555|5|I have just taken delivery of this book. However, leafing through the Introduction clued me to a &#34;page turner&#34; in the offing. So, I should safely submit that &#34;I can judge this book by the (Introductory) cover&#34;. Any thought from the Nobelist who gave us Prospect Theory stands to be hefty, any day!
B000002IOJ|3|One might start by saying that a lot of the material on this album is a departure from their two earlier albums. The biggest departure is the lyrics. For most reviews I don't even mention the lyrics because most bands don't know what they're talking about (or it sounds forced). But on this album, the lyrics deal less with the occult and \\"gothic\\" type themes to deal with worldy issue like rainforest destruction, the U.N., pathological liars... <br /> <br />The opener starts out with usual speed of a rock song. No speed antics yet...and there won't be any speedy songs for the rest of the album (the exception being \\"Blessed in Contempt\\" but even that is a stretch). Speed doesn't necessarily equal good, but Testament compensates well for the lack of speed with some of the narlyist guitar lines of ANY Testament album. (Just listen \\"Greenhouse Effect\\" and \\"Envy Life\\".)   <br /> <br />The guitar work on the album is very accomplished and deserves much credit. The guitar work and the overall song writing are the album strong points. The bass lines shine in between the guitar solos. The Achilles heel of the album is the rather bland drumming (that 'click' instead of 'pound'). Louie has to be one of the most unoriginal forgettable drummers of the brief Thrash history.  <br /> <br />Their creativity shines at the end of the album with \\"The Ballad\\" and the awesome acoustic guitars to that song. The instrumental song at the end is forgettable but even then it would be hard to call it bad. The one ultra-cheesy thing they do at the beginning of \\"Sins of Omission\\" is they play a kind of Knightrider theme chord. <br /> <br />Still a good album despite the differences between this album and the previous effort. It's not as much of a \\"shock-and-awe\\" oh-my-god-is-this-for-real? album as 'New Order'. Its more of a \\"let me sit down and think along with the music\\" kind of album. Worth having. 3 1/2 stars.

1572815108|5|As a tarot collector, the Thoth Tarot has been one that always intrigued me.  Designed by Aleister Crowley and Painted by Lady Frieda Harris, this one is probably the third most popular deck after the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot and Tarot of Marseilles.  With an intriguing collage of symbols, this is a deck that caters to the occult like no other.<br /><br />The Thoth Tarot from US Games comes in two sizes:<br />- 4.375\\" x 2.75\\" deck which is 0.375\\" smaller than standard US Games decks.<br />- 5.5\\" x 3.75\\" deck which is ~1\\" bigger and wider than standard US Games decks.<br /><br />The smaller deck is easier to handle and includes two additional versions of the Magus, while the images are easier to see on the larger one.  However, the larger deck lacks the additional cards.<br /><br />The back of these cards is non-reversible, showing a Rosicrucian cross, colored yellow up, white and black down, red left and blue right on top of a green spark, on a crisscrossing diamond pattern containing small symbols of wands, cups, swords, and disks.<br /><br />The Major Arcana are numbered at the top, in roman numerals starting at 0 with The Fool.  Comparing these to the RWS Tarot, I noticed that the following:<br /><br />I. The Magician - I. The Magus<br />VIII. Strength - XI. Lust<br />X. The Wheel of Fortune - X. Fortune<br />XI. Justice - VIII. Adjustment<br />XIV. Temperance - XIV. Art<br />XX. Judgement - XX. The Aeon<br />XXI. The World - XXI. The Universe<br /><br />These cards are labeled at the bottom, with an Hebrew character and an elemental, planetary, or astrological symbol included with the label.<br /><br />The Minor Arcana are arranged in four suits: wands, cups, swords and discs.  These corresponds to the elements of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.<br /><br />The pips are numbered at the top.  The Aces of each suit are labeled as such at the bottom while pips 2 to 10 are labeled with a key word.  These cards are illustrated, but focus only on the symbols of each suit, and are devoid of any figure, human or otherwise.  These include small symbols corresponding to the planet and astrological sing associated with them.<br /><br />The court cards are only labeled at the bottom as Princess, Prince, Queen and Knight of each suit.  These are associated to elements of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, correspondingly.<br /><br />The deck comes in a fitting box with a little white book (LWB).  In the LWB, The cards a numbered starting on 1 (The Fool) and concluding with 78.  The Ace of Wands is numbered 23, The Ace of Cups is numbered 37, The Ace of Swords is numbered 51, and The Ace of Discs is numbered 65.<br /><br />A lot of books have been written exploring the richness of symbols in this deck, so I'm not going to pretend to scratch the surface in this review.  Suffice to say that this is one belongs in the collection of any avid tarot collectors.and are devoid of any figure, human or otherwise.

B003MC5AV2|4|I have read all Elizabeth's books and I love every one of them. I read her book TAKE A BOW. I enjoyed every moment reading it. About 2 months after that I found her book PROM AND PREJUDICE. Loved that book too. And then this one wad just wonderful I definitely recommend any of her books.

B00HDMMISA|5|So many twists and turns, I was chomping at the bit the entire time. The author encompassed all perspectives while being able to keep the plot line clear. Excellent read!
B000002UAX|5|Although I tend to prefer The Beatle's earlier work, this album is one of their best in my opinion.  Double CD and all the songs are great.  Worth every penny!  You really can't go wrong with any Beatle album.

B00EMJBVAI|5|Best escape science fiction in a long time! You have to take a great leave of rationality but what else can you expect in a zombie movie.  The first third of the movie is the best, and it kinda bogs down in the rest.
B009GQ57ES|5|Amazing album.  Talented and unique artist puts his all into this.  Solid from start to finish.  I would expect some grammy's in the near future.

030746363X|3|Remember that old saying that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is? The 4-Hour body promises to show you:    ·        How to lose 20 pounds in 30 days without exercising;    ·        How to increase fat-loss 300% with a few bags of ice;    ·        How to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested;    ·        How the author gained 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days, without steroids, and in 4 hours of total gym time;    ·        How to go from running 5 kilometers to 50 kilometers in 12 weeks    ·        How to reverse \\"permanent\\" injuries;    ·        How to add 150+ pound to your lifts in 6 months;    ·        How to pay for a beach vacation with one hospital visit;    ·        How to hold your breath longer than Houdini; and much more.    I'd like to tell you that all the promises are true and that the author discovered some new information in each of these areas that reveals all these secrets. But I'd be lying. The truth is that most of the above examples are wildly overstated, greatly exaggerated, impractical, ill-advised or simply physically dangerous.    Let's go over just a few examples.    In the chapter on how to lose 20 pounds in 30 days without exercising, Ferriss says that it's possible to do so by \\"optimizing any of three factors: exercise, diet, or a drug/supplement regime.\\" He then goes on to note that in 2007 he went from 180 pounds to 165 pounds in six weeks.    But how is losing 15 pounds in six weeks the same thing as losing 20 pounds in 30 days, you might ask? Ferriss explains that he added about 10 pounds of muscle during this time so that he really lost about 25 pounds.  Two questions immediately come to mind. One, how do you know you gained 10 pounds of muscle during this six weeks? Two, you promised to show folks how to lose 20 pounds in six weeks without exercising - so how did you gain 10 pounds of muscle if you weren't exercising?    Ferriss claims he lost the weight by doing what he calls the Slow-Carb Diet:    1.Avoid \\"white\\" carbohydrates. He writes that you should avoid any carbohydrate that is or can be white \\"except for within 30 minutes of finishing a resistance training workout\\" as described in other chapters. (Workout sure sounds like exercise to me - don't you think?) So no bread, rice, cereal, potatoes, pasta, tortillas, and fried food with breading.    2.      Eat the same few meals over and over again. Basically, eggs, chicken, beef, fish and pork for proteins. Legumes include lentils, black beans, pinto beans, red beans and soybeans. For vegetables, choose spinach, asparagus, peas, broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, and sauerkraut.    3.      Don't drink calories. No milk, soft drinks, white wine, beer, or fruit juice.    4.      Don't eat fruit. Except for tomatoes and avocadoes (in moderation), don't eat any fruit.    5.      Take one day off each week. Eat whatever you want one day a week. Ferris has specific instructions on how to minimize weight gain and insulin release on your binge day.    He also recommends supplements to increase insulin sensitivity: PAGG, which is 4 different supplements (Policosanol, Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Green Tea Extract and Garlic), taken in a combination at particular doses. These supplements are taken six days a week, with one day off each week and one week off each two months. Ferriss also recommends that you do air squats, wall presses, and chest pulls with an elastic band a few minutes before you eat and 90 minutes afterwards on your binge day (again, what ever happened to that \\"without exercising\\" claim?). He says that the diet causes you to lose excess water and recommends that you take additional supplements: potassium, magnesium, and calcium.    If this seems all a little daunting that's because, well, it is. The hype is: lose 20 pounds in 30 days without exercising. The advice: give up all bread, pasta, rice, cereal, potatoes and fried foods with breading. Don't eat fruit, drink beer, or have fruit juice. Eat the same fewmeals over and over and over and over.    Let's turn to something else Ferriss promises: how to pay for a beach vacation with one hospital visit. In reading this chapter, Ferriss explains how he went to Nicaragua for two and a half weeks and spent about $2400 on travel expenses, housing, auto rental and food. So how does a hospital visit pay for his vacation?    Ferriss explained that he went to a hospital and had seven MRIs taken at a negotiated price of $400 each. He estimates that if he had to pay for those in the U.S. that they would have cost approximately $750 each so he \\"saved\\" $2450. He also estimates that he saved $640 on comprehensive blood and urine testing. This resulted, according to Ferriss, is a total cost savings of over $3000 which more than paid for his trip.    Does this make any sense? Ferriss claims it does because he uses the seven MRI for testing and prevention. But I question that assumption. First, who in their right mind needs seven MRIs? I'm over 50 and I haven't had seven MRIs in my lifetime. Second, I have health insurance and the few MRI's I've had didn't cost me $750 - something substantially less. Third, MRI's taken while you're healthy might not be beneficial to your doctor if you're injured. If I injure my knee running and my doctor wants an MRI, one taken three months ago in Nicaragua isn't going to be any good. Fourth, how do you judge the quality of the medical care you'll get in another country?    Again, the hype is much better than the advice.    What about the claim to sleep 2 hours per day and feel fully rested? It called polyphasic sleep and sounds great until you realize that it requires that you get your 2 hours sleep by taking 20-minute naps every 4 hours. Ferriss cautions that you can't oversleep and can't skip naps or you'll be a zombie.    Come on. Really? Who can handle this sleep schedule? And even if you can adjust to it after a few weeks, how practical is it and how long can your body endure it? And how healthy isit? The idea is that most folks only get a couple of hours each night of deep REM sleep, but isn't there also some benefit to the other phases of sleep?    I could go on and on in analyzing each of the claims in this book but I don't want to leave the impression that the advice was completely worthless.    It wasn't.    The Slow Carb Diet is similar to the paleo diet, or the Atkins diet. As such, it has some health benefits - with some tweaking. Taking a day off each week in your diet has been proposed by others (can you say Body for Life?). Many of the exercises proposed by Ferriss are valuable. He had some common sense rules about getting a good night's sleep that were valuable. His ideas on running with proper form (Pose method) are a Reader's Digest version of the training advice in Born to Run.    This is a big book in many sections. For those new to fitness, you should take all the claims with a grain of salt and proceed slowly. I wouldn't, for example, expect to go from running 5K to 50K in 12 weeks without injury. Ferriss has a couple of chapters where he consults with Brian MacKenzie (a former tri-athlete) to come up with a training plan.    Ferriss indicates in the book that he followed the plan. Did it work for him? He ends the chapter by saying that there wasn't enough time to update the chapter before going to press but that the outcome is on his blog. My book is a 4th printing and Amazon says the book was first published on December 14, 2010. But the link on the author's blog detailing how he did in his 50K run is suspiciously missing with a note that it's \\"coming soon.\\"    Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
B001ANSS5K|3|This book kept me interested throughout most of the book. Margo is an elusive character who people seem to be searching endlessly for. Just was not what I was expecting.
081298160X|5|(This review originally appeared on TipsyLit.com)<br /><br />Have you ever considered that everything you do is merely a collection of habits? For example, you wake up in the morning and either you roll over or you jump out of bed. The chances are good that whatever you do, you do it every day without thinking. You take your coffee a certain way, you make your sandwich a certain way, you speak to your family a certain way, you spend your evenings a certain way.<br /><br />In The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, Charles Duhigg explains how the latest brain research shows why we don’t have as much control over our actions as we’d like to think. We’re stuck in the habit loop of cue &#62; routine &#62; reward. You get off work (cue), you go to the gym (routine), and then you remunerate yourself with a smoothie or a glass of wine or ice cream (reward). Or maybe you get home from work (cue), you pop open a can of beer and turn on the TV (routine), and you put your feet up and turn off your brain (reward).<br /><br />Accordingly we are hard-wired not to lose weight, stop smoking, quit drinking and break other addictions. Once we develop the habit of burying our noses into a smart phone at every pause it’s nearly impossible to say no to that tiny little universe so readily accessible at our fingertips. Our brain takes over at the cue, hungry for the reward.<br /><br />The Power of Habit hooked me with the opening story about a woman who completely turned her life around by changing her habits. She went from an overweight and heartbroken smoker to a healthy marathon runner, happy and successful, in record time. Neurologists found that the patterns inside of her brain had changed. And though the old habits still existed, they were overridden by new ones.<br /><br />Duhigg has a way of explaining science in an accessible and captivating manner. Using countless examples from the 20th century, from social change to business to professional sports to organized religion, he identifies how habits affect everything, and how habits can change and be changed. Duhigg applies the lessons to his own life when he wants to break an afternoon habit of a chocolate chip cookie. First he identifies the cue and then the reward. The tricky part is changing the routine to get to the same reward. It takes some mindful research and a willingness to change, but with some trial and error and patience, he does it.<br /><br />As I read this book many ideas blossomed of how I can and should change my own habits. I don’t always go to bed when I should and I can’t remember the last time I woke up and jumped out of bed with energy. I check my phone and email and Facebook so many times through out the day that it’s become like a debilitating tick. I revert to the internet when I don’t want to focus. And it takes work to change these habits. It’s more than just awareness of the habit loop, it requires commitment to change the routine and self-control to ignore the old routine that never disappears.<br /><br />Benjamin Franklin said, “you can do anything you set your mind to.” According to Charles Duhigg, it’s not only about setting the mind to something, it’s about transforming the mind. He presents a compelling narrative on how human nature works and how we can regain some control. I recommend this book to everyone, but especially those interested in psychology, business and self-improvement.<br /><br />(This review originally appeared on TipsyLit.com)
B00COGY2P2|4|A decent Tom Cruise action movie.  Not as intense as his MI series but a decent story line and still plenty of action.  I enjoyed it and most likely will watch it again sometime.
B007FG9LIE|5|Loved this book - but did not realize that the next book would not be out until September.  Can't wait to read it.
B0082FPIY8|5|Wonderful reading. Well done girl on all levels. Compelling reading with not so gentle spotlights into your soul.  Did those feet recover?
B0064MPXFA|5|Wow, I can see why she wins awards for lead actress in a drama.  Excellent, excellent!
B00L9B7IKE|3|Okay just not worth all of the hype.
B00000K2SC|3|What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  There are over three thousand comments at IMDb and another twenty-nine hundred at Amazon.  There even seems to be some block \\"reviewing\\" from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life: Neo, \\"The One,\\" \\"Trinity,\\" saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc.  I would add that directors Andy and Larry Wachowski touched some other religious bases as well.  Note that Gloria Foster is \\"Oracle\\" (Greek mythology), that Lawrence Fishburne is Morpheus (of the Underworld) and that Joe Pantoliano is \\"Mr. Reagan\\" (a little secular allusion here).  The band of heroes are also referred to as \\"freedom fighters\\" to recall our ex-prez's words.  (But never mind.)<br /><br />The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love; in fact all of Hollywood loves The Matrix because it gave work to so many.  Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good-bye.  The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.<br /><br />But is the movie any good?<br /><br />Well, it's not much on video.  The DVD is undoubtedly an improvement, and on the silver screen it might lean you back in your seat.  The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.<br /><br />But I mean philosophically speaking?<br /><br />I think we can get a hint from a review that began (and I quote) \\"Why can't all movies be this good? -A 12-year-old viewer.\\"  Indeed, this is the question all those marketing minds in Hollywood are asking.  The true blockbuster action/adventure/sci-fi movie aims at a male viewer of about 18.  Ideally the range would include 12-year-olds to thirtysomethings.  Any philosophy beyond that mental age is burdensome.<br /><br />So you don't think it is a philosophically interesting movie?<br /><br />Actually I do.  I just don't think it's original.  I mean Plato's cave allegory is over two thousand years old.  And let's not forget The Wizard of Oz (1939) or even The Truman Show (1998).  Any science fiction buff can point to half a dozen precursors.<br /><br />Isn't that stretching it a bit?<br /><br />Okay, how about this short story from half a century or so ago called something like \\"The Perm-Machine.\\"  Everybody in the future society is working their nine-to-five tails off for a TEMP--that is, for a few hours in the box hooked up to the feelie machine complete with 3D screen, surround sound and electrodes attached to your every neuron so that the complete, thrilling, all senses experience of the greatest adventures in life are theirs, including sex, drugs, heart-pounding action and other sensual pleasures.  But what everybody really wanted was a PERM, which would place them in the box permanently hooked up to the electrodes and intravenous drips, etc. for the rest of their lives, a kind of virtual reality heaven on earth.<br /><br />What about the acting?<br /><br />Forget the acting.  It was okay.  Consider this instead: we are going to become software.  There isn't going to be any \\"warfare\\" between man and machine with the human spirit triumphant.  Instead, we are going to become more and more attached to our machines, our computers, our chips, until at some point (see Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence or Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution) the line between us and machine will be completely blurred.  And then, molecule by molecule, we will DISAPPEAR, and at no time will we even realize it happened!<br /><br />The Matrix is a vision of the future, but it is a hopelessly anthropomorphic vision, a kind of action/adventure director's scan, extrapolated from the present.  Where artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the prospect of quantum computers is taking us cannot be envisioned at all.  Some people call this the \\"singularity\\" factor.  The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.all this the \\"singularity\\" factor.  The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.

0061997811|5|I was working for our local YMCA this summer and a child brought the book with him one morning.  The other counselors and I were all hovering around him and looking at the book.  I then proceeded to order it from my cell phone while we were still there.  I have loved reading every page.  As a huge Harry Potter fan, having grown up with the characters, I loved getting all of the behind the scenes information that I didn't know about the filming and all of the actors/actresses.  It was a terrific book, for a very reasonable prices.  It comes with all sorts of exciting things that completely come out of the book, like the Marauders Map, Harry's Acceptance letter to Hogwarts, and a whole variety of other things.  It is a terrific book!

B000000OSE|2|By the time Guns 'N' Roses released \\"Use your illusion I & II\\" (1991) they were on top of the world, thanks more to their image than their musical skills. It's a shame that Slash got so much more attention than Izzy Stradlin - but that's another evidence that image and appearance is far more important in the music business than musical skills. Slash isn't at all a very talented guitar player (which you'll find out if you listen to his solo's) and Axl Rose's strained and high pitch squealing singing style can really get on your nerves. Although G'N'R were highly over rated, they actually managed to write some good songs like \\"Dust `n' bones\\", \\"Don't cry\\", \\"You ain't the first\\", and \\"November rain\\". The cover of \\"Live and let die\\" is rather attractive, but songs as \\"Garden of eden\\" just makes me wanna smash my stereo!<br />Some reviewer said that instead of two albums, G'N'R should have cut down the number of tracks and just released one album - that's exactly my opinion too. Get rid of all those annoying fillers and go for the best material.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Good book at good price.
B000JK8OYU|4|First let's get this out of the way--\\"Love\\" is the soundtrack to a show and that's the reason it exists. The bottom line here is that the remixes even if they differ very little from the final versions will make many of these songs feel fresh again to Beatles fans that have heard them a million times. Heck it might even convince someone raised on Nirvana or listeng to Cat Power to give them a try.<br /><br />The best mash versions of the songs on here are truly inspired George and Giles Martin combine the rhythm track from \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" with George's \\"Within You Without You\\" to truly stunning effect. The same can be said for \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" and even \\"Come Together/Dear Prudence\\". \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" features Harrison's acoustic demo (which appeared unadnorned on the 3rd \\"Anthology\\") with new orchestration by the Martins. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" features the progression from John's demo, to the first two versions the band cut to stunning effect as well. All of these are highlights of this album. All of these certainly deserve four or five stars.<br /><br />Equally as good are the new remasters of classic Beatles recordings including the first completely true stereo mix of \\"I Am The Walrus\\". While all the tracks sound stunning in either their new stereo masters/remixes or 5.1 remixs there isn't anything new here that a Beatles fan doesn't already own. It sounds a heck of a lot better than the CDs currently on the market for the band (with the exception of \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" and \\"1\\")but it's still the same classic songs. That's not a bad thing it's just that their whole catalog has been due for an upgrade for some time now.<br /><br />Why four stars? The mash remixes are solid throughout (although none as brilliant as \\"Drive My Car/The Word/What You're Doing\\" or even \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite/I Want You (She's So Heavy)/Helter Skelter\\")and the newly remastered tracks sound glorious but I was hoping for some of the mash tracks to be more radical than they are. Regardless hearing the 5.1 remix of some of these classics for the first time makes it a fun listen.<br /><br />Nevertheless Beatles fans will enjoy hearing the familiar strains of classic Beatles songs some altered a lot while others are altered a little. Like the \\"Songtrack\\" release this isn't anything new but will be enjoyed by Beatles fans but can't replace the band's classic back catalog which sorely in need of being upgraded.cks to be more radical than they are.

B00004TXR2|5|One thing that is good about Pearl Jam is they are not afraid to grow.  They do not stand and milk a formula, but move on, growing as musicans.  NO CODE is their best example of this.  That album recieved the coolest reception of any of them, although personally I like the album.  After going to more upbeat rock `n roll with YIELD, they continue this trend into BINAURAL.    There is only one other album that I know of that does what Binaural does: all the songs sort of blend into one with the others.  EXILE ON MAIN STREET, the Stones' record, does likewise.  There is no Jeremy, Daughter, Better Man, Hail Hail, or Given to Fly.  The tracks that stand out most is the single Nothing as It Seems, Thin Air, Insignificae, and Sleight of the Hand.  But these are still not anthemic tracks.  Instead, they contribute to the entire feel of the album.  The first three songs all sound similar to me.  YIELD was likewise, save Given to Fly.  However, I'm not sure if this is better than YIELD or not.  Soon Forget is a delightful little experiment that is 1:45 long.  Another good thing about this one is this much more of a band effort than their previous albums - there are several tracks that Eddie didn't write any of it.  Indeed, Nothing as it Seems was written solely by Ament.    There is a new drummer onboard.  Pearl Jam changes drummers like Van Halen changes singers.  (Did you hear?  Gary Cherone is out - reportedly, Warner Brothers told the Van Halen brothers get Dave back or they dropped, because of the dismal reaction to the eqaully dismal album VAN HALEN III).  I do not know if this is permanent (in the Pearl Jam drummer sense of the word).  As I understood it, Jack Irons (their drummer for five years) was sick during a recent tour, and they took Mike Cameron in his place - not because of conflicts within the band, but because of Jack Iron's health.    6-8-2000    As time has passed, I've grown to really like this album.  I think Pearl Jam has done a very fine job on this release.  There are few albums that the lyrics just truly stand out - this is one of them (another is Dylan's BLONDE ON BLONDE.  Such surrealistic stuff there it puts Morrison to shame).  Indeed, this is one of my favorite things about this album: the lyrics are outstanding stuff, with pearl jam (reverting back to the vs. days) truly stand out in their written verse.  All in all, excellent record, guys.        They are one of the few bands I respect.  In times of all these damned bubble gum teen bands (Backstreet Boys, Christine Aguilerra, N'SYNC, etc) we have a true band, Pearl Jam, continuing on the 70s rock tradition.  And I say \\"Rock on\\" guys!  If they'd just come to Christ, then we could really have a party!  That is what I am truly praying for.

B0001BKAEY|5|Revolutions is a bit more complex to understand; it is definitely a great movie with a lot of twists and turns. However be mindful when you are watching because it can be tough to follow. However a great movie.
B000W07EKW|5|I bought the Bourne Trilogy as a Christmas gift for my 37 year old son who had only seen the first movie but was looking forward to seeing the other two. He was delighted to receive it and watched 2 and 3 over the holidays. Everyone probably knows how good these movies are so I won't belabor that. I found them exciting, intriguing and satisfying on many levels. What was a pleasant surprise was the packaging they came in. Not only does the box hold all three with a magnetic flap but there is a very authentic looking Bourne passport inside. Fun!

B000JBXXZ4|4|First off, let me say I'm really surprised to see this album get such mixed reviews, although most are extremely positive.  I have the utmost respect for everybody's opinion...but I'm a little griped about some of these awful reviews.  Reviews given apparently by huge Incubus fans.  Let's set the record straight.  This is a band that is fully standing the test of time and only seems to get better and better.  But if you know this band at all, what you DON'T do is go buy their latest album EXPECTING a certain sound.  If you do, you probably will be let down.  Incubus is not cookie-cutter design group.  They are far too smart and a large pool of talent to stick to the same sound. <br /> <br />They will always reinvent themselves, keep it fresh and find a way to be creative.  And you just have to love that about a band in an age where everybody pretty much sounds the same.  Who sounds like these boys???  Nobody...ever has or ever will. <br /> <br />Alright, now that I've got the rant out of my system, onto Light Grenades! <br /> <br />I'm a huge fan of this album.  Like its predecessors, the first listen was a warm up, and I recognized that yet again...\\"this is different for Incubus.\\"  Many thought ACLOTM was a let down, I'm still baffled by this.  Next to SCIENCE, it's my favorite album.  But this cd is outstanding work, and is right up there with those two. Music wise, how can you complain with Mike playing the axe.  The man is brilliant, and he again and again impresses me.  The rest of the band is in full force as well, although I'm still listening for Kilmore on the records more.  But he does a lot more than just 1's and 2's now. And this album seems to be the most personal of all writings by Brandon...which adds to its power. <br /> <br />Summary of tracks <br /> <br />1. Quicksand -  \\"Ok...the monster is awake...\\" Just an intro track...but it does its job.  It sets the mood and tone for the whole cd.  \\"Some people fall in love and touch the sky, some people fallin love and find quicksand.\\"  You can tell Brandon has some heartbreak to share this time around. <br /> <br />2. A Kiss to Send Us Off - My favorite easily so far. A melodic riff comes in that is addicting and is followed by some classic Incubus grunge.  As the album seems to revolve around the subject of love, this song hits home for me as I feel it will for many.  \\"Just one...more...tongue...kiss before the sky it falls...out...from...this cloud we're hovering on.\\"  Painfully beautiful <br /> <br />3. Dig - A well chosen single to follow Anna Molly.  This song will gain many new Incubus fans, and will rub long-standing fans in a special way.  Like Quicksand, this song lets you know that Incubus has evolved yet again in the best of ways.  \\"We all have something that digs at us...at least we dig each other.\\"  Very poignant lyrics.  This song feels to me an anthem for best friends, and Brandon talks of camraderie being the message.  This will be a favorite to many. <br /> <br />4. Anna Molly - The first single, and for good reason.  Full of energy, speed and emotion.  There is a longing in Brandon's vocals that speaks volumes, while the lyrics are left to much interpretation.  Fans that have trouble adjusting to the band continually evolving their sound will cling to this song a while until they finally open up.  <br /> <br />5. Love Hurts - A great ballad.  Many reviews find this to be the low-point of the album, but across the board I've found it be a personal favorite to many.  A very simple song lyrics wise...\\"without love, I won't survive.\\"  A song purely about love, how it can be a blessing and a curse.  In this aspect, I don't see how it couldn't be a fan favorite cause almost anybody can relate to it. <br /> <br />6. Light Grenades - I love this song, and almost feel it would've been a better first single.  It has the same ability as Anna Molly to grab old-school fans and make them excited for the album, but if I hadn't heard much Incubus and heard this song on the radio I would be instantly obsessed with the band!  Going back to the days of SCIENCE, this song has an infectious groove, is urgent and its pace is so much fun to keep up with.  Brandon has fun with his lyrics, and you can tell.  Defintely one of my favorites. <br /> <br />7. Earth to Bella pt. 1 - I love how these guys pick the right time to slow things down, let you settle after such an energetic song and come back down to earth.  Ahhh but the best part?  It doesn't stay soft for long, when Mike comes crashing in with some thrashing guitar work while Brandon proclaims \\"I'm ok to sink...\\"  A short but sweet song, and a great seguay to the next track. <br /> <br />8. Oil and Water - This song really impressed me lyrics wise.  It's hard to resist a song that is so relative lyrically.  The rhythm and tone of the song takes me back to Morning View, Mike and Jose really do a great job here.  \\"Babe, this wouldn't be the first time, and will not be the last time...there is no parasol that could shelter these weathers.\\"   <br /> <br />9. Diamonds and Coal - If I were forced to pick a least favorite track, personally I guess it would be this one.  I love the song, and the aformentioned opinion will most likely vanish in a week.  At first it comes off too simple and redundant.  But once you get the message of the song, you realize the importance of repeating the title.  \\"In spite of this, we're doing just fine, even diamonds start as coal. Give us time to shine, even diamonds start as coal.\\"   <br /> <br />10. Rogues - This one to me took a page from ACLOTM, which is a wonderful page to take from to me.  The guitars are infectious, drums are tight and kicking.  \\"Hats off and applause to rogues and evolution! The ripple effect is too good not to mention. If you're not affected then you're not paying attention!\\" Mike busts out a killer, funky solo which will make many fans smile. <br /> <br />11. Paper Shoes - A wonderful song, again a little different for Incubus, which is why I love it. \\"You're about as reliable as paper shoes in bad weathers, but the pain will roll off water on feathers.\\"  Very melodic, and the drums are superb. <br /> <br />12. Pendulous Threads - An earlier reviewer wrote something I agree with on a certain level.  I feel this should've been the end track, cause this song packs some punch.  I love Earth to Bella pt. 2, but I would've pulled a switcheroo with the two tracks.  It doesn't take anything away from either song however.  Next to track 2, as of now this is tops in my book.  Mike gets in your face with some sharp guitar work, and builds to the bridge.  This is another song that harkens back to ACLOTM and SCIENCE simultaneously.  The drums and bass are intense, and if the band is as smart as I think they are, they will HAVE to play this song live cause the energy is undeniable. It would have been the perfect ending to this album, just like it had the perfect beginning. <br /> <br />13. Earth to Bella pt. 2 - I love this song, its just a note I wouldn't end an album on.  \\"Don't you want to see the deep, it's not that hard...\\" Still a great song, indeed. <br /> <br />Any true Incubus fan just has to show a lot of respect for this album, while it has some sounds from past works, it is still amazingly fresh and different for the band. Just really listen to it, the entire way through...more than just once or twice.    <br /> <br />Outstanding songs - A Kiss to Send Us Off, Dig, Light Grenades, Rogues, Pendulous Threads <br /> <br />\\"Sleeper\\" songs (songs that you will end up loving the more you listen) - Love Hurts, Earth to Bella 1+2, Oil and Water, Paper Shoes <br /> <br />I gave 4/5 stars cause I couldn't give 4.5...which is what I really feel.

0767903862|5|Bill Bryson is my Idol. I suffer from agorophobia so I don't get to travel.  But I vicarioulsly get to travel through books like this. Bill Bryson is very detailed and he must do a ton of research. In this book he travels through the whole of Australia and stops at all the interesting places. The wonderful thing with Brysons books is you get to laugh and learn at the same time. I have systematically started reading all of his books, but I am almost afraid to real all of them for there will be no others.  Weather You give a hoot about Australia or not you will get a hoot out of this book.

B00003W8NM|5|This movie has an awesome premise and simply has a very surreal and eerie atmosphere to it. Its the story of a man who is ruled by his own posestions and must have everything perfect. He attends meetings every night so he has somewhere to go. He eventually meets Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt (who I might add does an awesome job of portraying this strange character). They create the &quot;Fight Club&quot; where people join and fight bare fisted for fun, not to the death. The Fight Club gets out out of hand and the world starts crashing down around the main character played by Edward Norton. The final twist is gonna make you simply drop your jaw and stare at the screen, then after the movie back in the box youll sit there for about 20 minutes thinking &quot;How was that possible....&quot; or &quot;He was there but who was the other guy then...&quot; Itll boggle your mind. Ontop of all that it is full of action scenes which get pretty gruesome. This is a top notch film and definitly warrants a purchace.

0060558121|3|The story-telling is good, and the characters are well developed.  The imagery is well done, and you get a good feeling for the story and settings.  I found myself a little disappointed, however, that the plot didn't go anywhere more interesting.  The climax was so predictable that I found myself waiting for the next twist, but there wasn't one.  A fun read, but it doesn't make a huge impression.

The program is far more stable than others I have tried, so I would recommend this app in a heartbeat.
B00HZ3C4N6|3|OK movie for action movie fans but a lot of this stuff is too unbelievable evan for a movie - example, while riding in a wild chase scene, Ryan is dialing a cell phone, riding one handed, jumping obstacles and looking at the screen whild dialing.

B0000028W9|5|The Future is is among Cohen's best albums and leaves us begging for more music. Unfortunately Cohen has been keeping us waiting for almost seven years now...LEONARD WE WANT A BRAND NEW ALBUM !....but a Cohen CD is always  worth waiting for. We prefere one masterpiece over six mediocre ones.  Anyway, this album is a true masterpiece. The best songs to me are  &quot;The future&quot;, &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;Waiting for the  miracle&quot; and &quot;Closing time&quot;. &quot;Always&quot; is too much  blues for my liking, too long as well, but knowing that the song is very  special to Leonard (his mother used to sing this tune when he was young), I  can still like it in a way. &quot;Tacoma Trailer&quot; is an incredibly  beautiful instrumental track. WE WANT MORE !

B000A6T29O|2|Lighten up Lara. There is such a pile of macho manure in this film that you need a snorkel.<br /><br />Arrogance runs so rampant across the screen that you can't tell the good guys from the bad in this movie. I remember when heroes had a little humility. That's what gave them staying power. Look at the likeable Indiana Jones that Harrison Ford created. Even look at the characters in the MUMMY. In that film even the villain had his moment of pathos and he even got to come back in the sequel! I'll tell you, that mummy was no dummy. Lara, you are out of your league. It was great to see Richard Johnson on the big screen once again on this film's theatrical release. That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Thanks Richard.

B0010T75W6|5|JCM & Stephen Trask are master minds & a dream team! Completely in love with this story and this charcter. I'll be seeing the Broadway adaption in June starring Darren Criss & could not be more excited.
B00EB6ENXO|5|This movie perfectly coincides with all the other Marvel Movies and fills in a lot of story line gaps. The acting is superior and there are awesome graphics. It's exciting and thrilling from beginning to end.
B000PMFS2I|2|Showgirls starring Elizabeth Berkley is complete and utter trash but this film does have cult-status so I give it two stars instead of one. Berkley is no actress, she wasn't even that good on Saved by the Bell. Kyle MacLachlan always plays a creep well but otherwise than that Showgirls lacks sensuality. Horrible film from a good director.
6304080921|5|This is the best science-fiction movie of the 90s.    It has a brilliantly complex plot carried forward by the excellent performances of the actors.  Brad Pitt was spectacular as a raving lunatic, and Bruce Willis gave one of  his better performances as well.  Another plus is that they didn't decide  to make this a huge action blockbuster; it relies on its plot to make it  work, and work it does.  To fully appreciate the depth of this movie, you  have to watch it at least twice; you'll never catch everything the first  time.  And it's complex...I finally got the rest of my family to sit down  and watch it, and fully half of them didn't understand what was going on.  Don't get me wrong though...this was an excellent, unforgettable film.  Forget the Matrix; see 12 Monkeys.
B005ZUR724|5|I have been helping my parents and I'm definitely getting this. I watch youtube videos of this and luv the graphics. Worth the dollar. Check out jojopetv on youtube.
B0044RUSZM|4|I ordered the Griffin Laptop stand to elevate my 15\\" MacBook Pro next to my external monitor. It makes it significantly easier to do video editing on two screens when they're actually side by side. Considering the price, I was a little nervous about what the quality of the stand might be. Surprisingly, it's a very high quality stand in my opinion. It's made out of quality material, it is very sturdy, and it has guards on the end to secure the laptop a little more. It fits my 15\\" very nicely, it might be a little small for 17\\", and it matches the style of the Macbook wonderfully. The way it's elevated, it allows for me to place a couple of textbooks, a reading book, and a Kindle all underneath it in a very neat and organized way.<br /><br />So, here's what's good about this product:<br /><br />The Griffin laptop stand seems like a high quality, sturdy stand to me that also looks really nice. It has a \\"minimalistic\\" look to it (which I absolutely love), and it also has some grips on the end to help hold your laptop in place. The way it's built to elevate the laptop, it leaves a small storage area for a couple of textbooks underneath. It's also a breeze to assemble (more on this below though).<br /><br />What could make it better:<br /><br />Like I said this is a great product, but there are some areas where it could be improved. For one, the grip on the two metal strips could be a little stronger. They're not very \\"grippy\\". If it weren't for the guards on the end, I would be a little worried about the laptop falling off. Thinking back to the assembly, I think a little more support would make it more \\"secure\\" in a way. As it stands, you just slide them into place. Maybe adding a couple of screws would help this.<br /><br />Well, there you have it. It's a great stylish stand that's easy to assemble and fairly sturdy. It's definitely a great stand for the price.
B00FIUO8MI|2|Predictible
B000IOM0YM|5|To all of you people who are so-called \\"diehard\\" KISS fans and only give this set one or two stars because of video quality, you aren't fans at all.  These concerts and interviews were taken and not tampered with at all straight from the 70s, so of course the video quality is going to be bad.  You should be happy they released this set at all. Stop complaining and be thankful....

B00KQFP5GS|1|First robocop far better
B0031KC8OC|5|Quirky, fun, and relatively innocent show.  While there is some inappropriate sexual material, generally this show has fun characters, with a uniquely strong high school female lead character leading the way.  From one episode to the next Veronica and her friends and enemies are taken through mini-mysteries as Veronica tries to maintain focus on the big whodoneit that is the overall story arch for the entire season.  The characters are generally well written, although some are a bit obviously cliched, I'm looking at you Logan Echolls and Duncan Kane.  Otherwise, a fun show that includes mysteries that don't have you feeling depressed or scared for your life like Law and Order or Criminal Minds may.
B00004T9UF|5|ok. i am going to start off saying that this cd will probably offend 99% of the people on the face of this planet at some point. but that aside, if you just sit down and listen to the entire thing, you will realize that: 1)Eminem is incredibly talented and probably the best rapper alive today, and 2)that the lyrics are NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. on one song he says &quot;half of this stuff i just make up, to make you mad&quot;, but people are still too sensitive to realize that it is not meant to be a guidebook for living your life, it does what it is supposed to, and that is be an awesome cd with incredible rhymes and more emotion than anything a boy band or even half of the real bands out there have ever done. yeah, KIM is about killing his wife, but it's not like it is glorifying it. it is a really sad, angry song about someone who was betrayed by the person that they loved. is it offensive? yeah, probably to most people. does that change the fact that it is a great song on one of the best cds i have ever heard? definitely not. this song is an emotionally charged masterpiece, and everyone should at least give it a chance. listen to it once, and see if you don't agree with me.
1400079276|4|I went in having had no previous experience with Murakami, so I would recommend this novel to others the same. If you check out the negative reviews you'll see that some people really hate this book! I can understand why, and I do agree on some points. (It can get obvious and pretentious in parts, but to me the whole /was/ greater than the sum of its parts.)    I enjoyed the characters, the tension, the scenery. Oshima in particular is a really well-crafted character - one of my favourite characters from recent literature. I won't go into plot details and character relationships, but I will say that I enjoyed this book enough to go back and re-read it a few months later. (And I love cats, so that was a bit of effort.)    Regarding other people's complaints - soft porn, pointless violence, meaningless entertainment, shallow philosophy - quite honestly, I enjoy a bit of those sometimes! It's perfect if you're looking for something to pick up and escape into. The loose threads that most Murakami readers hate just don't bother me here. Having said that, I've only read Kafka and the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (which I didn't enjoy as much).    To finish off this roundabout review, I'll only say that I enjoyed it and it's worth a read! The protagonist is easy to get along with, the split narrative style kept me turning the pages and the whole thing was generally a good read. It's not light reading but it won't drag you to the edges of emotion either. Recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is sooo addictive omg I love the game it's just so fun to play and you get to buy stuff with fake coins

031623480X|5|Every person who values life and health for himself/herself  and their family should read this book.  It is about how research has found that gluten found in wheat products and too much sugar as found in many foods even fruit can have an adverse effect on the brain and cause impairment leading to dementia and alzheimers.  I wish my doctors would read this book as after reading it myself I fear they are offering everyone including my wife and myself the wrong advice concerning cholesterol and possible cognitive impairment.

B00AHTYI5M|4|Read many reviews with a lot of criticism about it not being historically and politically correct.  And this is true in part.  But it's a movie and it's entertaining and I think you can put 2 + 2 together and figure out why there would be a need for discrepancies.  I would recommend viewing it.

B004TACMZ8|5|This model was rated # 1 by Fine Home Building magazine a year or two ago, so I bought it to replace my Stanley model, which I didn't like. It has a round indicator which glows when you get close to something in the wall as well as an LED-type screen with a scale that helps find the center of the stud, pipe or whatever. The screen can be illuminated if necessary and the beeping signal can be turned off if too annoying (thank God).<br /><br />For normal use this model may be as good as these things get. But none of them are perfect, due I think to the nature of the task for which they are used.
B009WUBERW|4|There is more story ... and a whole gaggle of old action stars ... just my age.  I love them when we were all young and beautiful and I love them now that we aren't.  They kick everybody's butt and entertain me while they are doing it.  Who could ask for more than that?  It's not great drama, but it is great theater!!!  =)
159514188X|5|Th1rteen R3asons Why is a thought-provoking story about love, loss, friendship, high school and tragedy.  Clay's character is one anyone can relate to.  He is that person who didn't say what he wanted to, and then found out that it was too late.  Hannah's voice on the tapes is cryptic, sarcastic and brutally honest.  The insight that Asher provides into their lives and brains makes them seem as if they could be your friend, or even you.  This book was wonderful and sad with comic relief intermixed in all the right places.  This is a book that I would definitely recommend.
B004EBZX6W|5|One of my favorite's with a lot of good lines and a great ending

B000002LPD|2|Van Halen were always a lot of fun. But with this album the fun was kind of going out of them. We know the VH guys love chicks, but to actually call an album FV(K, I mean it seems like a big point to be making. It wasn't fun anymore, it was a statement. And this album feels like a statement.     I should reiterate that this album is actually Van Halen's most preofessionally delivered album, and it won a grammy for best hard rock performance, which it probably deserved. The band is tight and professional here. They stretch out a bit too. But it just ain't fun anymore!  And it wasn't the 80's anymore. It was the 90's. That was the BIG change from the last album.     Well, there is good material, but while the last album felt like a collection of songs, this album defintiely feels like an album, but too many of the songs just sound the same. I mean right smack dab in the middle of the album you get three slow-medium songs that all make or break the 5 minute mark. 'Pleasure Dome' is an eerie medium paced rocker with a complex but great drum beat, and it's a more daring song for the band, with some unusual time signatures, and some strange spoken vocals. There is a lot of complex guitar soloing that drags the song out to almost seven minutes. This is followed by 'In 'n' out' a very average, by the books rock song, but it lasts for six minutes, and while 'Man on a mission' is a bit better, it still lasts 5 minutes. So thats 18 minutes of fairly ordinary medium paced rock, and that can't be a good thing. This is one fo the most electrifying rock bands in the world, so what in the worlds going on? But at least those three songs are followed by the genuinely electrifying 'The Dream is Over'. I wanna give a big shout out to this song, it simply flat out rocks! What a freakin' heavy intro, man that rocks your socks off, and that guitar solo in the middle of the song, that's so electrifying, as is the line about 'It's a RIP OFF!!'. And yet the chorus actually sounds like alternative rock, with kinda gospel backing vocals. It shows that Van Halen were an open minded band that could change with the times, without selling out. Anyway, they had sold out long ago...    The opening 'Poundcake' is also an excellent song, and the closing 'On top of the World' is a joyous exuberant pop-rock song with a great melody. However, 'Spanked' and 'Run around' are sex songs that lack wit and feel matter-of-fact. 'Judgement Day' is such an angry song it hardly feels like Van Halen, and I never have liked the preachy 'Right Now', the piano is great near the start but this song is a power ballad that bands like 'Styx', 'Kansas' and 'Boston' had delivered in handfuls over the years, albiet without as much adulation. I guess this song is one of the better ones, nut nothing is really really bad. However, the overall effect of this album makes it worth about 2 1/2, rounded down this time.
B00PTB7B34|5|Is a great addictive game
B003ES5ZPK|4|My home theater system is probably like most. Pending a redesign (upcoming over the next few months,) everything in the back of the system is in tight quarters with little to no room to work. Nowhere is the space crisis more of an issue than with the system cabling.     Forcing HDMI cables to make sharp, tight turns due to lack of space is never a great idea.  The AmazonBasics HDMI Male to Female Swivel Adapter was just what I needed to manage the HDMI cabling issue. It is a compact well thought out design. The flexibility that it offers to the HDMI cables running behind my home theater is a godsend.    There are some concerns here. For one, this kind of cable mobility often carries with it signal deterioration over time. Dust and dirt get inside the adapter and normal wear and tear reduces the conductivity. I don't know if this will occur with the AmazonBasics HDMI Male to Female Swivel Adapter. However, this is something that I will keep an eye on as the adapter ages.    The other concern is what version of the HDMI standard is deployed in the adapter. The Micro connector defined in the HDMI 1.4 specification retains the standard 19 pins, but shrinks the connector size to something resembling a micro-USB connector. This device may not work then with HDMI 1.4 cables. But, for the price, this can be considered a throw away product to be replaced when you upgrade your cables. And, for now, it does the job of reducing cable tensions and mine quite well

B00I8Q77Y0|5|I think this is a great game. It is easier than the real flappy bird, and looks better. Better graphics, different types of birds, better background, and medals. GG.
B000063WDH|5|Their first album is absolutely their best. They have a great blues sound with no comparison.
B00699SDR8|3|A good, brief overview of the history of western philosophy. Keeping in mind that the book's target audience is supposed to be in their early teens, the book is well written. Much of the criticism of the book is targeted at the writing, and I believe that it is unjust. If I had read this book in my teens it would have been much more relevant, and much newer. I'd recommend the book to friends or family members who are in their teens.
B005HSL626|5|the game is fun I play it very day) I hope.that you like it as good as me hope you have fun with it good.  yes or no
0307744434|5|This is one of those books that made me sad when it ended - because I wanted it to go on and on and on!
B00PTB7B34|4|It's a really well done game but when you get the &quot;retiring&quot; screen it freezes and every thing gose slow
B00B0LPWU6|4|This film had a surprising story line and an unsympathic hero that redeemed himself in the end.  Worth the viewing.
B00688628M|5|Brilliant
B00HY7VU60|3|It would have been so good if they would have left out even half of the nudity and sex scenes.
B0007DAZW8|3|Well I now have \\"Human after All\\" in my hands. <br /> <br />1. Human after All - Great Song 8/10 <br />2. The Prime Time of Your Life - Not sure what this is 4/10 <br />3. Robot Rock - Great Mix of Dance and Rock - 8/10 <br />4. Steam Machine - Just a big mix Loop - 6/10 <br />5. Make Love - Its decent 7/10 <br />6. The Brainwasher - Not much to say with this one 6/10 <br />7. On/Off - Its not even a song!!!!!       1/10 <br />8. Televison Rules the Nation - Its got a decent beat 8/10 <br />9. Technologic - One of the better songs - 8/10 <br />10.Emotion - Its slow, ugggg 6/10 <br /> <br />Really and truley I like this Record. But the tracks don't stick in my head like \\"Discorvery\\" or \\"Homework\\" did.  <br /> <br />Pick this up if your a fan like me. If your new to DaftPunk pick up \\"Homework\\" or \\"Discovery\\" first, then give this record a chance.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Beautifully written story about WW1 Europe. I particularly appreciated experiencing every aspect of life through the senses of the blind Marie Laure.
B0014JIFWG|5|Great to slip on for getting out of the house in the morning. The non slip is a must for working in the hospital. Easy to clean and they wear great!
B00DW1WR14|1|I decided to give the samples a chance, something I hadn't done since I heard singles off Yield and Avocado.<br /><br />Sounds like they suck even more than ever. I was never a fan of the band, and I thought Vitalogy was a ridiculous album when it came out (I know no one would agree with that, but who cares - people rave over Green Day's crap too) because it all sounded like amateur garage rock. Spin the black circle, Whipping - you're telling me that YOU can't write riffs like that? There's something strange about the PJ fan mentality for sure. And Buhh-ter man and Nawwthing maaayHHHnnn were overrated too.<br /><br />Pearl Jam is up there with U2 for being overrated except of course U2 actually had some good songs till 1984. PJ have a handful in their entire career. Here's to you Rolling Stone, Rock hall of fame, Village Voice, Patty Smith types: keep listening to this proud hipster music, grow that beard, read Huffington Post, cheer Obama (same as his predecessors), more power to you. I'm out.
B00KBYLR02|2|I enjoyed the free portion of the game because it is not all doom and gloom, but $4.99 is way too much for just a game that is just hidden object.
B008Y6ZRBY|5|Great movie
B00A1EOBJQ|5|Great music and a good selection
B0054JZC6E|5|I love this game its a tank!!!!! and the games are super fun how did they make this so sweet
B0071QIN00|2|The game has many bugs, won't excelarate after pressing the jump button, freezes during a jump in mid air, have to exit game to continue. Really liked trial extreme but this one is not as refined. Please fix issues
B00S4YGWD8|5|the Babadook is absolutely unique. This isn't any average horror movie &#34;jump scare&#34; and &#34;gore fest&#34; type movie. This is something that is different which is why people hate it. Absolutely incredible movie which deserves the title as a modern day classic! (A)
B00009V7PJ|5|... I couldn't believe how well this DVD was rated. I bought it to see it first hand. Results: All reviews were right. The show is awesome an audio was incredible good...<br />A must have for your DVD collection.
B000XR49VQ|1|First, I love this movie. It's five stars in my book.<br /><br />The $50 version being offered here by 'classics_vhs_dvd' is a complete rip off. It's not a proper DVD-Video, it's a DVD-R that's been made from a VHS tape and one of those cheap home recording boxes. It's shame this movie isn't available in a better format.
B009LDD1X0|2|This DVD set was on back-order and it took FOREVER to get to me. So we were really excited when it finally got here, but then we went to watch it and we had two disc #1, then disc #3--but no disc #2. So we waited all that time and couldn't even watch all of it because all the discs weren't there.
B00SXK8R6S|4|I read all of her books. On Outlander except the last on. It is going to take forever for the whole story to be told at this rate.  I even got my husband to watch it.
0394800184|5|Nice quality book. Great gift for baby shower. Was on mother to be's wish list.!  Great story for small children.
B00FKF0F3C|3|Not as exciting as the first two books in the series
B000E1MTY0|4|1. Picture transfer - 8 (1/10)<br /><br />2. Sound transfer  - 8 (1/10)<br /><br />3. Movie Content  - 8 (1/10)<br /><br />This was, in my opinion, the best of all of the Batman series. The action was far more believable and the fighting scenes were much more true to life - sloppy and random with pushing and rolling. The scenes and/or locations had a good range from dank and droopy city shots to bright and gorgeous mountain range footage. I rate this movie a solid 8, which to me means I am glad I bought it, but yes there is better. For the price however I would say that this disc is exactly as advertised, a good first HD DVD to own.<br /><br />PS. Take my advice the only way to win a war is to recieve benefit from both sides victories (ala Switzerland). If you have the money purchase both an HD and a Blu-ray and let them out do each other. If you must purchase one I would go with the Blue-Ray, - much more stable platform(Toshiba dominates the HD DVD market and my experience is that Toshibas are very unstable, regardless of firmware) and anyone who says that one has a way better picture or sound is either lying or is trying to compare apples to oranges(different movies cannot be compared). Also be very carefull when you buy a Blu-ray player, I would wager that all pretty much supply the same quality picture, but alot of companies have extra sound options, such as Dolby True HD or Digital Plus, as well as DTS HD. Now all of these names sound cool but in reality all you need is an uncompressed PCM sound track. I bought a Samsung as compared to a Sony because of the price difference and I'll never care or think twice about some of the sound \\"options\\" I \\"passed on\\".
0399255370|4|Love the ColorSync the illustrations. My kids love this book. They giggle towards the end for Peach crayon. Very cute book.
B009IEXKXI|4|I like it for the most part, there where ups and downs and &#34;er, really?&#34; parts but it kept me going until the end.
B0094BB4TW|2|the update sucks I cant use the emojis or anything<br />im getting aggrivated with it. the update wont let me open up some of he messages.
B000VUCIZE|5|Great thought provoking book
B00GYQYL7W|5|Amazing storyline,  themes,  characters and acting.  An excellent &#34;coming of age&#34;  film that adds numerous internal/external struggles one would never expect. This movie will make you think and feel.
B009EE4YWI|5|My students read the book and so I treated them to the movie...goooood item...
B007R0WHMK|5|The actors in this film are fantastic, I love the storyline. Some people may not like the very end of the movie but I feel it's poetic and clever.
B003L20ICE|5|Once in awhile you come across a movie that hits on something real. This is one of those rare creatures. It's a family picture, but offbeat because the two parents are middle-aged lesbians: Annette Benning looking very old, and Julianne Moore. Their two kids are basically well-adjusted teens. Everything comes apart when the kids track down their sperm donor, Mark Ruffalo (one of my favorite actors), and he and Moore fall for each other. Things get emotional. Great script. Wonderful acting. Great score. I can't praise this enough. It had me hooked.
B00513F9Q6|3|I've read several of Ms. Atwood's books this summer and this one did not measure up, in my opinion.  She usually leaves me stunned with moments when her beautiful and brilliant prose jumps off the page and into my soul, but I experienced relatively few moments like that during this read. The idea for the story is good, but I didn't connect with the main character very much and found her to be quite unlikeable actually. She is basically a smart, talented, attractive woman who lets one mean girl from her past turn her into a grump for the rest of her days. I didn't feel much sympathy for this.  Blind Assassin, The Robber Bride, Alias Grace and of course, The Handmaid's Tale are all way above this in quality of writing and characters.
B000002N2N|5|I AGREE THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST LIVE ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!<br /><br />I WOULD COMPARE IT TO MOTORHEAD LIVE AT HAMMERSMITH AND SAXON<br /><br />EAGLE HAS LANDED! JUST ONE GREAT SONG AFTER ANOTHER. YOU FEEL<br /><br />LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT IN THE FRONT ROW! IT MUST'VE BEEN GREAT TO<br /><br />HAVE BEEN THERE. I AM PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN THE<br /><br />USA WHO BOUGHT THIS WHEN IT CAME OUT AND I'VE BEEN LISTENING<br /><br />TO IT EVER SINCE. IT NEVER GETS OLD. SO IF I HAD TO RECOMMEND<br /><br />A FIRST RAMONES ALBUM THIS IS IT! GABBA GABBA HEY TO ALL THE<br /><br />RAMONE FANS OUT THERE!
B003B02PF4|5|I always wish Grisham's books were longer because once I start I can't put them down.  Always a great read.
B00000AFGM|5|I bought this disc just from their performnce at the 98/99 mtv video awards. 2 years later i am still hooked! More layers come with each listen. A great intro to MM. ACSS is good too, but this disc is much more focused  and completely a classic!
B0000VCZK2|5|Love the series! Just bought Prometheus! Never been disappointed in any movie! A must have for the true fan! Ripley is the best!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Candy crush is an amazing game , it's fun and easy to play and I myself love it I'm an addict that's for sure. If you haven't tried it you need to its challenging ,but real fun!!!
B0083SBJXS|5|This movie has it all. Action, sci fi scenes, comedy and the hulk. great
B000001EYO|3|Thank you for a movie that has changed my life.<br />Having just watched the movie for the 20 something time, I have come to the realization, the sound track is a mere shadow of the original score. 'Your in a world of pain',  John Goodman's speech in the bowling alley as he threaten Smoky with his  life, is hung against a backdrop of and unknown song. 'The song really tied  the scene together man...'I am resigned to buy DVD player JUST to read the  music credits. Yes, the CCR may be in Forgarty's legal battles, but, Ethan  and Joel, please in future movies, use a disclaimer the soundtrack is a  mere shadow or the original. The selection of music to this movie was  nothing short of brillant.
B00IX9UTLU|5|Others have compared this book to Shades of Gray - but I find that the story is different enough and the writing much better than that - it is a story of love surviving despite the demons that may have haunted us in the past. It was an engrossing read. The only disturbing thing was the nickname of &#34;Precious&#34; used by a male figure. I thought the author made a mistake there - since it automatically made me think of Lord of the Rings and not in a good way. But other than that - good read.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Can't stop playing.u
0812932293|5|Yes, you can be successful in business without being a stuffed shirt or tyrant.  Branson examplifies the American Dream.  Here you have a swashbuckling individual who bucks the system and lands on top in every  endevour he chooses, not to mention a few lasses along the way.
B000XUBFE2|5|Such a good book. Great for youth to read to see the grief war causes and the kindness of some people to others.
B004XXIHS2|5|Ira Levin's A Kiss Before Dying is cleverly plotted with enough twists and turns to keep you turning the pages until the very end. A peek inside the mind of a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Excellent suspense thriller!
B00GEEB730|5|I almost stopped at the 1st chapter.  It was so depressing and I said to myself \\"this guy is such a curmudgeon\\". But the reviews were so glowing that I kept reading. I'm glad I did. It was really good.
B00000JTB2|5|This is what heaven is going to sound like the day Albert joins Stevie there. My goodness this is the best of blues guitar that I have ever heard! And I spend a good chunk of my time and income listening, baby. Let me tell  you easy and simple. This sound is the number one reason why I am striving  to reach heaven. Then when they throw in those little parts of the  Kingmaster himself giving those small tidbits of advise to the little  skinny kid from Texas...well it about brings tears to your eyes...If you  love the blues, kid, do not waste another second pinching that lousy dime,  this cd is worth it ten times over...just buy it!
B000FCKC4C|5|Paulo Coelho's novel is an instant classic about a young man's journey to discover his purpose in life and his place in the universe. A great read for a wide audience.
B006QRQVMC|5|I had the collection in regular DVD's but wanted to improve the quality of the images. Also my disks were played with by my grand kids and were a little scratchy and wanted to improve.<br /><br />This is one of the best collections for the 21st Century.
B004KPQK2S|5|It's great, very inspiring!
B00AE6SS5O|4|The game offers traits of mystery, and the charm of Christmas great for the kids, and anyone really who is into a Christmas mystery.
B004MC8CA2|5|The app makes it easy to do some reading in the best Book written, in a way thats easy to understand.
B00BAXFECK|5|It was really suspenseful but also very, very long.  Still I'd highly recommend it based on other books I've read recently.
0316056863|5|I wasn't sure how this book was really going to turn out, but I was laughing out loud the whole way through! Truly hilarious!
1250038820|5|I love HONY. I preorderd the book pretty much as soon as I could. And I love it! He's so talented.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|LOVE CHRISTIAN GREY!!! This will definitely give you a different insight into Christian and Ana's love story. He is very raw and surprising to the reader on his thoughts. I fell in love with him all over, again.
B00JB3MVCW|2|Really be a lot better if they would follow scripture better.
B000000XB9|5|Never forget this good music. It is perfect.
B000TEPL92|5|Love Richard Marx! Great collection!
B00E1LQ7Q0|2|not impressed - did not do Justin justice
B0001XAOLQ|5|Classic - gets top rating. Long and very detailed, be prepared in advance, have plenty of popcorn, this is a real thriller and far surpasses anything Hollywood ever tried to make. <br /> <br />Best submarine movie ever made!!!
B004W2UBYW|5|Good book about Steve Jobs.  Jobs was interesting, very gifted man and enjoyed.
B004GJDQT8|5|Great tool when expecting a package
1466401885|1|This is quite possibly the dumbest book I have ever read.  The only reason I finished it was that I kept imagining that somehow it just had to get better.  It doesn't. The subject matter and writing are juvenile at best.  Perhaps if you are not over the age of 18, it might hold your interest.  Otherwise, don't waste your time or money.
1451626657|5|I first read this book in 1962 as a 20 year old. I loved it, was transformed by it. Years later I would periodically re-read it and fall in love all over again with Heller's prose, his unmistakable characters,and his profound truths about war and human nature. All this served up with a rich language and zany characters. I just re-read it yet again now, 50 years later, and found more to discuss and ponder evan all these readings later. The rich and rewarding experience of reading \\"Catch-22\\" is a gift to all who experience it.
B005U9QIXY|5|Enchanting. Love anything Jim Henson has a hand in. This is wonderful. A family favorite.
B008FRFN7A|1|FOR THE MONEY ONE PAYS FOR THE KINDLE HDX YOU WOULD THINK THA YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO PRINT FROM IT WITH ANYONE OF THE PRINT PROGRAMS .
B00DVKOYBM|4|At first I wasn't thrilled with this app. I kept being reset to first level. That seems to have been fixed. This is a ton of fun. The graphics and game physics seem riight. The matchups are fair.
B003VQQG8K|5|The illustrations lend credibility to the story. Fast faced, action packed, keeps you on the edge. Dan Brown is a great writer.
B009UX2YAC|5|Subway suffers is so fun. You get to have a bunch of characters.
B00DPM7TIG|5|This is an absolutely beautiful book.  Wonderfully written.  Highly suspenseful.  Fell in love with the characters. Very sad  to have it end.
B0055PGUYU|5|Great book with many examples about how we create habits and how we can change them. Clear and easy to read.
B0051ANPZQ|5|It's a great story showing how one person can really make a difference with having to overcome obstacles and still be great.  It is especially good to be talking about 5th graders and all the peer pressure of that age
1616614609|5|While a bit complicated and the quickest game I have ever played takes an hour. If you can play magic the gathering you can learn netrunner. the A-Symmetric game play is very unique and allows for a wonderful play experience. the seven factions all have there own feel and style and allow for a very versatile game. I could play this game endlessly, my only complaint by tournament rules you can use upto 3 of any card and this base set only has 1 or 2 of some cards, E-bay will help you fix this as would a color copier but fantasy flight needs to relaunch this with 3 of each or a mini expansion that gives you all the cards you would need to make 3 of each.<br /><br />If buying this game and you want to get an expansion I would recommend any of the expansions other than creation and control for a first expansion. the reason is simple every expansion except creation and control contains card for every faction. creation and control contains cards for only 2 factions so you will find yourself only using 2 of the many factions and missing out on some content. Creation and control is still a very good expansion just not recommended as a first one.
B003WUYRGI|1|This wasn't a good idea to have the same thing including an optional word I think that the same way as to have been a good idea that the government to have been a good thing for me to the government of Canada is a great way to date width the ground and death in a good time for me is that the ground up to the government of birth control pills to the government is that the same thing as true to have been a great deal with it was a good idea to have been a new comment by an average American idol season of Canada and Mexico city council of Canada and death of a good thing including an independent worker who is a great deal of birth control over your own company that the government of birth control and Mexico city in the government is that the ground and death penalty in the same way as the same thing for the government to date with a new comment on the government is a great job with the ground up to date of birth club in the same thing including the government to date with a good time to have a good time for me and Mexico city of Canada and the government of birth club in a new comment your own site is a new comment on this up to have been yummy yr and the government is a new comment your name and death in this up err type in the ground floor e err independent rd f2f just think Thu the v hmmmm Bjorn BBC cycle and off rd f2f xxx comment r xxx chef tree CD
B00J4S962W|4|Bought this for my star wars and lego-loving husband. He put it together in a few days and it looks great although some of the pieces slide/fall off when you move it. Other than that, it did what it was supposed to - kept him busy for a few days!
B00FB13Y74|4|Super fun blend of original Angry Birds characters in a moderately challenging racing game with its own individual challenges.  Upgrade your vehicle and unlock new angry birds to help you race.
1451698852|5|I love this book! Just finished reading it for the second time, and once again could barely put it down - even though I knew the ending this time!
B001P1MZNI|4|I don't really like the talking parts.  That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.  Great album, otherwise.  A classic!
B008IJT0CE|5|I enjoy listening to these relaxing sounds while sitting on my couch.  I am a country girl and this just gets me back to nature the way I remember it as a young girl.
B000MRAAJW|5|Bought a 42\\" HD screen and HD DVD player just for this set of discs and it was worth it. Stunning photography. I just want to spend all my spare time watching it.
B008JFUNWS|4|Good rendition of the book though they could have added more from the story into the movie. I can't wait to see how they develop and bring the third book to the big screen.
0425266060|5|Love the books!! Love gideon!!! Can't wait for the next book to see what happens I hope Eva doesn't get in trouble in san Diego !!!!
0440180295|5|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is increadable.  It is a book that gets better every time you read it.  His style of writting is fast paced and full of things you won't catch the first time.  His unique narrative sets this book apart from all other novels I have read and his message is profound.  A must read for everyone.
B00SBNVLWY|5|I stumbled on the first book, Brie learns the art of submission quite by accident. I was hooked, I have read and enjoyed every single book since. I would absolutely recommend this storyline.
B00CH26TL8|5|I love this game. Each time I think I will try something new, I keep coming back to Bubble Witch! You have to plan your moves carefully so that you can not only burst enough bubbles but also collect stars. So much fun!
B00B81B0HC|5|I love this CD.<br />Radioactive grew in popularity and I just had to listen to the rest of their music. All of the songs are really good and catchy.<br />I got this as an MP3 download because you have it instantly on the computer. It's very convenient.<br /><br />I'd recommend this CD to anyone that likes music. It's just that good.
B005GFPZYK|4|The book is written very conversationally and at times feels like Mr. Kyle is sitting next to you telling a story. It is at times funny and heartbreaking. To me, the most interesting aspects of the book are not necessarily the combat scenes, but the contributions by Mrs. Kyle and the preparation that goes into the missions described. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the first hand view of a SEAL's life and of a Iraq war veteran's life.
B004JN1CW4|5|Great book!
B008MEM24S|5|Kids loved it
B005NPCUC8|5|This has always been a favorit album for me.  The digital remaster is exactly like the original but better quality sound.
B00BJS7LHC|5|So good. Classic Tarantino. Best movie I have seen in 10 years without a doubt. Only reason I wouldn't watch it is if you are sensitive to violence.
B008Y2X78S|5|Just an OUTSTANDING series. Waiting got a Season 5!!!!!! Love the show. Emmy Awards are so deserved.
B00005M91K|5|Gorgeous!  Stunning!  A must-see!<br /><br />One of the most gorgeous films ever shot.
B00CKJ2KK2|3|Why do u need to download more y can't it just auto-macticly download and if u don't download it u go to the menu WTF
B00L9B7IKE|4|Great read
B0063IH60K|5|this is a game you can play that doesn't require hyperactive speed or too much brain power. a game to relax with.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game. Hidden pictures with puzzles and assignments. Hidden pictures are harder than others. Nice challenge.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is one of the best I have played!  I can't seem to get enough of it.  I especially like the idea of changing locations.
B003MX95H6|5|This is now one of my all time favorite movies!! I love the story, the characters, and most of all the soundtrack!
B002G1YPH0|4|Originally bought this product for a new build with premium parts.  After reading how the Ivy Bridges run hot, I decided to also buy the H100 by Corsair as an upgrade.  Well the H100 sucked and didn't even work.  Luckily I still had this and has kept my Ivy Bridge 3770K under 40 Celsius.  I have a push pull configuration.
B00KG2PQUQ|5|loved it great action, stars, and romance
B005V2EVBQ|5|When I got my Kindle Fire, I knew immediately that I'd need some sort of cover to protect it against the normal wear and tear that can occur on a daily basis, but as the device itself is a little on the heavy side I really didn't want to add more weight than necessary. This folio from Marware is nearly perfect. It adds practically nothing to the profile or weight of the Kindle, it has a nice and sturdy feel to it and it has a very cool folding cover that can be used as a kickstand. Very happy with this purchase.
B00JP5GRVM|3|If you have nothing else to do it fills the time
B00932DCS8|4|Solid movie through and through. Slight pacing problems for me at some parts but can't find too many faults with it besides certain convient pieces I found, but that just my opinion of course.
0399250573|4|I have to say that this series has been one of the best if not the best series I have ever read. Alex is portrayed so well that readers try to solve the problems he was faced with just like he would. I found myself so engrossed in the books that I would stay up late just to try and finish it before I would pass out from exhaustion. This book was great all though I do have one minor thing to point out that didn't go over to well with me. Alex using a real gun. Now don't get me wrong, I love stories with guns; but it seemed so out of place in the book. Now besides that, I think that the series was perfectly ended and that we can finally rest assured that Alex is safe.
B009PNQUXO|5|nice app
B004W89N72|2|I'm with the other folks. Until this links to Google calendar or something else, is useless. Add the sync and it could be a very useful calendar app.
0307352153|5|Great book.  Silence is golden.  And a sign of brilliance! Also makes a great gift to the loudmouths in your life.
B005HEI61Y|4|The rest of the episode was decent but fairly unremarkable. But the last scene was touching. Just to think about how that would be... iPad in hand... That made it worth the wait. Interesting and different premise, too.
B000VDDWE2|5|this is definitely one of the best action movies i've seen in a long time, acting was excellant, special effects the best ever. just a really fun movie to watch i was glued to my seat from start to finish, not many movies do this, the best movie ever....[[ASIN:B000NDFN0G Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray]]]
B001P9KR94|4|THE MOVIE    The story of Slumdog Millionaire is, oddly enough, something you could easily see becoming a movie. A little heralded, straight-to-DVD movie; an executive taking a chance by putting it out in theaters; that same film dominating the Academy Awards, and becoming one of the best films of the year, making a star of its young leading actor. Sounds Hollywood, doesn't it?    It's odd for a movie to become so inexplicably popular, but Slumdog did it. While I did (and do) love the movie -- and consider it one of the best films of 2008 -- I have to step out on a limb here and state, on the record, that I do think the movie is overrated. Good? Yes. Great? Close. The best movie of 2008? Not quite.    Still, Slumdog is a fantastic movie the first time you experience it.    The story revolves around Jamal Malik, a young man from the slums of Mumbai, suddenly finding himself in the hot seat on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Inexplicably, Jamal seems to know the answers to every question. Accused of cheating, he's taken to a secure location, where the police \\"interview\\" him to get a confession. Of course, it turns out Jamal isn't cheating; rather, the answers to the questions come from his own life experiences. And what a life this young slumdog has led!    The film plays artfully between past and present. In one moment, you'll witness Jamal being \\"questioned,\\" and in the next you'll witness a much younger Jamil having to find a way to survive in the world, as many poor orphans (and non-orphans) are forced to do in India's slums. Along for the ride are Jamal's older brother, Salim, and the girl he knew since childhood, Latika. Starting out as homeless, penniless, hopeless orphans, the seesawing chronological tale shows the ways life can treat a young slumdog, and Jamal and Salim play perfect foils to one another; Jamal is the boy who desires to escape and avoid a life of crime in favor of moderate living, while Salim is slowly enticed by illegal workings and the gangster lifestyle.    As the film progresses, director Danny Boyle (yes, the same guy from the zombie flicks) takes us to places in India we may have seen in books, but that we've never seen before. Aside from the well weaved story, Slumdog's true charm comes from the feeling it exudes. On one hand a familiar world we can understand; on the other something so different that it may shock or disgust more sheltered viewers.    Ultimately, Slumdog is one of those \\"feel good\\" movies that, at the end, makes you smile. Is the journey always happy? No. But, as I'm sure you'll be able to ascertain, the ending certainly leaves off on an overall happy note. There are a few problems with the narrative here and there, but overall, the story is solid, it leaves you feeling good, and there are only minor issues. The biggest issue, perhaps, is that once you've seen it, you can never see it the same way again. Some movies get better with repeat viewings -- some stay roughly the same. Slumdog Millionaire, however, is markedly lessened with each viewing. Maybe it's because, after seeing it, the strange and unfamiliar sights and culture aren't so strange and unfamiliar anymore?         THE DISC      - Audio and Video -     One of Danny Boyle's signatures is using various types of cameras and films when shooting, resulting in scenes that look entirely unique to the rest of the movie. That strategy is employed in full force in Slumdog Millionaire, and never has it looked so good. The transfer to Blu-ray is spectacular, and near-reference quality. Colors are vivid, blacks are deep, and certain scenes look incredibly realistic. The only problem I noticed was, in some scenes, grain seemed to be a bit more present, and less an artistic use and more a technical limitation. There's also a problem with bloom in some scenes, but nothing too worrying.    Those two issues are minor, and on the whole the video of Slumdog Millionaire on Blu-ray is as close to reference quality as you can get. It just misses the boat, but it's definitely one of the best looking films to come out so far this year.    If the video is near-reference, the audio is above and beyond reference quality. I knew the movie (and soundtrack) sounded good when I saw it in theaters, but who knew it could sound better in my living room! Presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround, the audio is easily the best part of this release. Surrounds are employed to a great extent, really capturing the feel of urban slums. If it has one drawback, it's that it can be too loud -- too overbearing -- at times. With all of the little sounds going on in every scene, it's easy to want to turn it up to fully hear the atmosphere. But a minute later, the bass will kick in, or some foreground sound will increase, and suddenly you'll find yourself fumbling with the remote so you don't agitate your neighbor. (Although, if you live in a city maybe you can convince them the noise is coming from outside...)       - Extras -    The extras include the fare you'd expect with a release like this, but little of what you'd hope to see. To start off, there's the mandatory commentaries, the main one being by Danny Boyle and Slumdog star Dev Patel. Boyle goes on and on about the making of the movie and generally covers everything with a thick layer of enthusiasm, but Patel only offers a few real interesting tidbits, likely since he's not used to this sort of thing yet.    Next you have the deleted (and extended) scenes. A majority of the running time is spent extending scenes currently in the movie, but there are some worthy deleted ones that should be watched, including more fleshing out of Jamal and Salim's teenage years. Nothing that will alter how you view the picture, but worth watching for fans and non-fans alike.    Then, there's my favorite, \\"Slumdog Dreams,\\" which is the \\"making of\\" of Slumdog Millionaire. It gives an interesting look at some of the challenges a Western crew faced filming in Mumbai, aswell as some of the unexpected problems that arose. Not too long (at a little over 20 minutes), but entertaining and informative.    In a move that may surprise many people, Slumdog Millionaire actually has Blu-ray exclusive features! One of them (\\"from script to screen\\") is short, clcoking in at about 5 minutes, but the other is substantially longer. Unfortunately, it's a very specific piece for a very specific audience. Titled \\"Manjha,\\" the short black and white film (about 40 minutes running time) follows an actual slumdog through the streets of Mumbai, as he struggles to survive along with his baby sister. A fantastic story and one that must be told... But compared to the movie, a little -- make that a lot -- dark. If Slumdog made you happy and romanticize slums, then this will bring you back to earth.       - Verdict -    Slumdog Millionaire may not have been my favorite movie of 2008, but it's still a fantastic film. Sadly, there aren't as many extras for a Best Picture winner as I'd hope, but maybe we'll get the No Country treatment and see a special edition down the line. Until then, if you haven't seen Slumdog yet, this is by far the best way to do so. The film looks gorgeous, sounds bloody fantastic, and is a very inviting tale with enough character development to satisfy even the most jaded of critics. If you already saw it in theaters and were hoping for a few hours of extra material, I'm sad to say you'll have to keep waiting. In the meantime, still give picking this one up a thought. It may not have been my Best Picture for 2008, but so far it's easily the Best Blu of 2009. (So far.)      Movie Score: 4 / 5  Disc Score: 4 / 5  Overall Score: 4 / 5

B007J4T2G8|3|This book is just what it is being touted to be - erotica and nothing more.  Story line pathetic.  Even worse than a Mills & Boon storyline because the writing is so atrocious.  Typical poor, innocent girl meets rich, sophisticated man and of course he falls for her.  Storyline goes nowhere.  Read this a couple of months ago now and haven't being inclined to read the second.
B00CWY76CC|4|It's challenging. I like how each level makes me really think about my next move. Ever since I downloaded the app I can't stop playing.
B0009A40ES|5|Um, a slasher? A thriller? What are people looking for watching this movie? Its a full on dark comedy, with some social commentary. Yes, its violent. But every circumstance of violence is accompanied by a insanely psychotic act and awkward way of going about life that coulnd't have been done better. The music theme is hilarious. Every bit of writing is executed wonderfully. Take or leave it, but well actually i don't care this is just my oppinion.

B003Q6D27S|5|I now own the full series of Saw which I love this phycological thriller. Just in time cause Saw 8 is said to be out in October of 2015. I will own Saw 8 when it comes out on the DVD to complete the set. I hope that it is worthy of the first 7 Saw movies. I love them all. I hope you will too. Bring out the food and drink get the friends and family around the big screen and enjoy yourselves on movie night. This is a real good series.

0316055433|2|I stopped reading at about page 365, leafed through the rest.  I suspect that there are a number of beautifully crafted and compelling pages somewhere in the next three hundred, but... I don't care.  The opening of the book is impressive; I was hooked at the start and eager to follow the well drawn characters until... the protagonist lands in Las Vegas and the third of several sub-plots devolves into  Easton Ellis / seamy underbelly/ sexy step-mom/ drugged teens eating chips and smelling dog s***/ bad dad and loan sharks.  By the time Theo Decker gets back to New York and into Euro-trashiness, I was done.
B006R4H5FG|4|Enjoyed the examples and comparisons used. This really gave substance to each of his points. The book goes further then simple presentation ideas, but definitely makes you think of every facet of an opportunity to present.<br /><br />Sometimes a little broader scope then expected but otherwise worth the read.

B004A8ZWVK|5|Every once in a while a movie comes along that completely transcends entertainment. Based on a novel I've not read, The Help adds one more layer to the Civil Rights movement. The hardworking layer of the African American maids who lovingly raised the children of their employers and then suffered many of those same children growing into bigoted adults. Stories are shared, lives explored, attitudes revealed and the fictional account is likely just a tiny shadow of reality.<br /><br />A white young writer (Emma Stone) who is part of the upper social class struggles with her \\"friends's\\" treatment of their maids. And she feels deceived over the disappearance of her own family maid/nanny, a woman she loves maybe even more than her own mother. She approaches one maid about telling her story so she can write a book. For the maid to reveal what goes on behind closed doors could cost her what little she has.<br /><br />This film is so well written, filmed and acted that it needs multiple award nominations. Powerful, inspirational, sad and important. I highly recommend it, even for children. Language, some mild violence and the themes might be issues for younger children, though.

It is grown up, smart, funny, and worth watching.  I bought this for my wife, who loves the whole twilight nonsense, and we both ended up falling in love with this series. We will be buying seasons 2 & 3.

B0002OERI0|5|Ah Green Day, how we love thee. Has it really been 16 years for these guys? Seems like just yesterday I was listening to a new lil' band from Cali in my room. Memories...anyway \\"American Idiot\\" is Green Day's latest album. It seemed like an eternity when the guys were away, but the wait was worth it. What our wait gave us was a much more mature, artistic, and eloquent musical experience. As a whole the band has improved. Vocally, lyrically, musically, this album is above and beyond even Green Day's standards.   <br /> <br />Some have started screaming foul because Billie Joe decided to dawn the black clothing and mascara. But the fact is that this transformation began happening to Billie Joe before bands like MCR made it an \\"EMO\\" (I hate that term). And to call Billy Joe or Green Day \\"EMO\\" would be like calling Britney Spears \\"Metal\\". The fact is that Green Day A) grew up and B) transformed themselves. The band went through a very rough period as a group and basically were reborn. The thing that some seem to not understand is that the guys are not 20 anymore. Their 30. Pre-Idiot music like Dookie  was coming from a more teen angst/anger direction. It would be very odd to see 30 year old men singing about teenage issues and trying to look 15. <br /> <br />As for the people who hate this CD for the \\"anti Bush\\" theme listen here. American Idiot isn't just about Bush. There is a very good story that is told through this album and only a few songs are politically based.  <br /> <br />Musically Green Day has got to be the best 3 man set there is right now. Tre is nothing short of amazing at the drums. Mike has really expanded his range as far as guitar work goes. And Billie Joe? Well Billie is Billie. Vocally Billie Joe sounds stronger and more clear. Artistically the band has really stepped it up. Billie Joe's lyrics have matured very well here. The result is a CD full of singles. <br /> <br />As for this being \\"pop/punk\\" I'm not going to lie. It is...in a way. But thathas been Green Day since day 1. And as for there being a lot of \\"teeny boppers\\" running around posing as Green Day fans: let `em. The fact is everybody knows that this band is great. Go to a Green Day concert and I can tell you first hand that there are no \\"teeny boppers there. It is 15-50 year olds. Anyone who hates this album is coming from a background that is in support of the president and the war or hates the fact that Green Day isn't posing as something their not. If this CD weren't good then they wouldn't have won 32 awards with it and gone quad platinum. They have always won awards even with Dookie, but never like this. When I'm listening to Green Day in my 40s hopefully I won't have to hear any more of this \\"sell out\\" babble. In any case this is the definitive band of this generation. A band that has been around 16 years and already could be going into the Rock & Roll hall of fame in 06. I've been a Green Day fan for years and I grew up with them. It is only fitting that they did to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I absolutely hate reading books, but this book was recommended to me by my teacher... I read it in a full day. It was hard to put this book down and live my life today. It is so amazingly written and very shocking as well appealing. Thank you for being a great author and letting me know there is a such thing as a wonderful book.
B001JFZ118|5|One of my all time favorite movies ever!!repeated viewings and it never gets old.   THANK YOU
B00003CXSP|4|In my opinion, this is probably the best Hannibal Lecter movie, with MANHUNTER coming in second although it lacks Hopkins and involves HL minimally.  Very few horror movies can boast the amount of first-rate talent found in this one: Ridley Scott, David Mamet, Anthony Hopkins, and Giancarlo Giannini.  Julianne Moore is no worse than Jodie Foster in the main female role, but neither is convincing to me.  Scott, Mamet, and Hopkins add considerable depth to the HL character and succeed in an almost impossible task of making this monster both attractive and likable in a perverse sense.  The main problem with the movie is its excesses (common to most such movies nowadays): HL is simply TOO dangerous and efficient.  Also (not to give too much of a spoiler), the \\"brain\\" business is silly.  The movie should have ended with HL kissing Julianne Moore. What comes afterward is medically stupid and unbelievable.
B00E8KLWB4|4|This game is fun, it's more on the 'pass the time' side than some of the other hidden picture games, meaning there isn't side activities. The only issue I've found is that as you advance it is so hard to get energy restored, for free, it takes all day so you only get like 15 minutes of play if you don't want to spend money. But overall it's fun and challenging.

B007IXWL2C|5|The whole Trilogy was good.  This book was really confusing at first, trying to figure out where they were going with the story.  It was still just as good as the other 2.  I also think this book leaves you hanging for either an opportunity to add a 4th book or maybe move on to another story about one or two of the other characters in the books.

My  page-turner check marks  go to:<br /><br />✓Writing, ✓Plot ✓Characterization and ✓World-building<br /><br />4.5 stars<br /><br />I almost quit reading this book after the first ten pages. There were too many similarities with Hunger Games, Red Rising and Divergent and Mare's voice sounded exactly like Katniss in Hunger Games .<br /><br />Mare steals (like Katniss hunts in Hunger Games) with her male friend Kilorn (Gail, Katniss' friend) to feed her family (like Katniss) because she lives in a world divided by color (like Darrow in Red Rising) where she is a &#34;Red&#34; (like Darrow) oppressed by the powerful &#34;Silvers&#34; (like the &#34;Golds&#34; in Red Rising).<br /><br />Mare finds herself in the middle of a an arena (like Katniss), where the different &#34;houses&#34; (like in Red Rising) are competing to show off their powers and, after an incident, she is forced to impersonate a Silver (like Darrow has to impersonate a Gold), to train in combat with other teenagers like her (like Katniss and Darrow) and to become an icon for the rebellion of her kind (like Katniss and Darrow).<br /><br />But once I stopped rolling my eyes and got over all these similarities, I was glued to the book! the writing and world-building are five-stars amazing!<br /><br />Victoria builds a rich, complex world with different Silver &#34;Houses&#34; each one with their colors and powers, Silver countries immersed in a centenary war, a court full of cunning, betrayal, and blurred lines between good and evil and allies and foes. &#34;Anyone can betray anyone&#34; and “A lie will raise me up, and one day another lie will bring me down.” are two of my favorite quotes. And of course, there is the Reds that conspire and rebel against the Silvers to &#34;Rise, red as the dawn&#34;<br /><br />Though Red Queen is plot driven, there is a great balance between plot and character development. The characters are multidimensional, likable and believable. No one is infallible or perfect, they all have their weaknesses and strengths. I also liked the romantic tension. It builds up subtly, well embedded in the plot. I liked all the male characters with potential to become Mare's love interest: Cal strong, brave a natural leader but blinded by his convictions.

B000000993|5|Great Great Album! Highly Recommend..
B005LJKEXS|4|It was as advertised, tightly coiled. This resulted in additional time getting to go straight. But, otherwise, a fine value.
B000B8QEZG|5|Confessions On A Dance Floor is already really popular! Not only is Madge back, but she's back to stay, and back to rule the world. There are literally no bad tracks on this album, and most of the negative reviews posted on here are by no other than Mariah Carey's fans - members of TeamLamb, I say... The first single, Hung Up, has already became a number one hit in more than twenty places in the world, whereas the album has became a mega-hit worldwide, going onto sell four million in its first ten days, and opening Charts at pole position in over twenty-five countries in the Globe.  <br /> <br />HUNG UP <br />When I first heard Madonna was recording a dance album, I though, great! I couldn't have been more happier. When I heard she was sampling Abba's Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, and also working with the ultimate dance meister Stuart Price, I was over-joyed. When I heard the song on the radio, I though, hmm...catchy song. The album version is ten times better! I love the part where the music goes down low to build back up again. Fantastic opener! <br /> <br />GET TOGETHER <br />Where Madonna used the 70s sound sampling on Hung Up, from this song foward, Madonna tries to create the future disco sound. She pulls it off! This is yet another fantastic song which should not be missed. I really hope this one becomes a single. Speaking of which... <br /> <br />SORRY <br />...is the second single from the album. It's one of my favourites from the whole album, actually. Definate top three pic. Madonna speaks of how she's heard all of her boyfriends excuses before, while constantly repeating, I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before, etc, etc. Great song! <br /> <br />FUTURE LOVERS <br />In the evidence of its brilliance, this song is great! Madonna samples Donna Summer's I Feel Love here, and the spoken parts are particularly effective! Fabulous! <br /> <br />I LOVE NEW YORK <br />This song has caused a massive amount of chaos and controversy on Amazon, and I can see why.This is probably the worst song on the album, and the lyrics are so bad. That being said, I was a little dissapointed, because this song was literally hyped before the album came out. Stuart saves the song with his amazing dance beats! <br /> <br />LET IT WILL BE <br />This song is somewhat stripped-down and relaxed yet shaky and you can still dance to it. This one is definately a top five pic. Madonna repeats the title track alot, but this makes it unique. Somehow, the music in the song at the beginning reminds me of Die Another Day a little bit.  <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE <br />The name of this song was originally placed in Madonna's 1994 album Bedtime Stories. This one isn't the same song. It's a completely different song, with different lyrics, and obviously, a dance beat. The originally song was an uptempo ballad. Great effort. <br /> <br />JUMP <br />This one is said to be the third single from the album. Madonna uses lyrics like get ready to jump, and I can tell you now, you will be jumping with this song! Madonna delivers her vocals perfectly as normal, and Stuart continues to amaze me with his music! <br /> <br />HOW HIGH <br />This song expresses Madonna's robotic voice more than anything else. The lyrics are quite clever. It uses the words nobody's perfect and I guess I deserve it - they are both songs of Madonna's from her Music album. Fantastic song. <br /> <br />ISAAC <br />This song has been dubbed herendous by a few people (not on this site - it's a favourite on here!), inapropriate and the worst song on the album. It's certainly not! This would be yet another top three pic for me. I love it when Madge takes risks like this. This is your Ray Of Light song. I love the Kallabah-ness going on in this song. Just excellent! <br /> <br />PUSH <br />This is the second song Madonna has dedicated to her husband, Guy Ritchie. The first was from her 2000 Music album in the name of I Deserve It. This song is brilliant, but it's not one of my favourites. <br /> <br />LIKE IT OR NOT <br />The perfect closure. This is my number one choice from the album. It's a fantastic song, but music is brilliant, and the lyrics are overwhleming. Need I say more? <br />
B00DV2D0JC|5|Fun in the sun. Will play it again and will try others. Hope they have more like this one.  The ending was great.
B00GGEVKYO|5|Peter Jackson is a genius,his attention to detail is second to none.I was initialy disappointed with the ending but realized he couldn't do the Dragon to his satisfaction so he had to come up with a different end to the story. which was done well. The story he did give us was fantastic a blast to watch. And the beauty of the world he created is wonderful.As are the characters he creates.<br />  Update : I wrote the prior review not knowing about the next two parts. Which are as equally thrilling and entertaining as The Unexpected Journey was to watch. The next two parts are The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of The Five Armies. The detail Peter Jackson puts into all of his productions is of coarse always unequaled in the film industry. This and the following two parts were a joy to watch and worth every penny spent.

The \\"twist\\" at the end of this one was telegraphed long before we got there and it took away from an otherwise well told story. All in all though, this one's a winner.
B003XVYLDU|5|Science fiction meets philosophy and a war novel, it's  an excellent book.
B00BIPKROU|2|As the seasons proceed I'm finding the writers are introducing more and more objectionable content, slowly but progressively. It's disappointing. It's not necessary and there of those of us even now who would prefer to take the higher road.
B00AZRBLHO|5|After attending a presentation by the author, I eagerly consumed this book.  As a software developer and manager in a company transforming from services to product development, I have frequently related situations, struggles, goals, and characters presented in this book to myself, my colleagues, and my company.  I highly recommend this book for an approachable, enjoyable, and applicable introduction to managing software development and IT.  The book does an excellent job of presenting the concepts of DevOps and exposing its relevance to various corporate stakeholders who must participate in order for DevOps success.
B00632HWOG|1|The newest version of yahoo email sucks.  It looks like AOL email and I hate AOL email.  Yahoo execs and anyone that implemented this version of Yahoo email should be fired, it is very cumbersome and SLOWWW.<br /><br />They need togive users an optionbefore changing email formats.
B004RE29PO|5|Classic Sci-fi flick.
B000FC0V3E|5|A classic I have added to my Kindle collection. Ernest Hemingway's writing is like no other author, unique, inquiring, and imaginative.
0062267787|5|Very Happy
0679735909|5|I read this book years ago when it first came out.  It was incredibly well written.  Very much a contemporary romance novel (not the 18th century term of the word), but so well written that it defies those trashy paperbacks that line the grocery store checkout aisles.  If you are looking for clever writing, intelligent adult dialogue, and a romance that makes you believe such a thing still can exist then read this book.
B007K3JCAE|4|My fiance and I went on our first date to see the first movie. We loved it and each other so when the second one came out we went to see this movie as well. We happened to be in her home town visiting family at the time so she was showing me around and telling me about stuff, so we were having fun. Then when we watched the movie we were riveted the whole time.<br /><br />It's nice to have those memories as I watch this movie again. And it's a blu-ray so it's good quality.
B005LAII62|5|This is a good story, and it holes up well to the end.. My only complaint is because so  much of the movie takes place at night, the screen is very dark, and for this 73 year old, it, was difficult for me to see all the action. All in all, a very good movie.
3822856282|5|What else can I say? The pictures are amazing. The character is a light hearted, opinionated, and beautiful young woman that will captive you with her substance, wittiness, and charm.
B004SBS8LA|5|Graphics look great and Is free for only one day!! I wish the amazon appstore had more awesome apps but I didn't expect much on its first day open either.
B002QE3CTY|4|After reading this book , I read it again the went to get the second book. Just have to know what happens.
145162607X|5|I can justimagine how this is going to turn out. While I have not read this book to already know the History behind the storyand thw wonderful way Ms. Gregory brings a story together I can hardly wait!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5|It was great to get the NHE description from someone that studies the brain and prior to having one himself, didn't believe in the afterlife.  To be honest, after reading I feel much less scared of what happens to us after we die.  Great book!
B00W6XM002|5|So glad they finally made a version for the Kindle Fire. This is one of my favorites and I have not had any problems with the game. Thanks, King!
B00CWVGBEO|4|I really enjoyed the movie<br />and I like Arnold he can be funny at times.
B000LC55F2|5|I saw this in the theatre, and found myself discussing it with my fellow movie goers all the way home (30 minutes).  The next day I still was figuring out, in my own head, how the pieces all fit together in this movie.  Christopher Nolan has directed my two favorite movies, Memento and The Prestige.<br /><br />Sadly, when I received this on DVD, I was eager to watch it again.  But this time through, I found myself asking why I didn't catch all the clues pointing to the end when I watched it the first time.  The reason? Mr. Nolan knows how to give you all of the info without giving you the key to figuring it out.<br /><br />If you like magic, \\"thinking movies\\", movies with a twist, and paradoxes, you will love this movie.<br /><br />Even David Bowie was great as the part of Nicola Tesla.
B00L9B7IKE|5|This is an amazing twister of a novel. The writing is excellent and the plot is so twisted that it's like riding a wild bull of a story. I could Not put it down.
B003ODL004|5|The Extractor.  The Chemist.  The Point Man.  The Architect.  The Tourist.  The Shade.  The Forger.  The Mark.    All of these are characters in the movie, and I'd like to add to the list of characters...The Composer.  Zimmer and his score on this movie are absolutely a crucial element in the overall experience of this movie.  Others have already described all of the individual tracks in detail, so I'll just add my two cents and state that this is a fantastic work that should win the Oscar for best 2010 film score.
B0089LOKHG|5|I was hooked from the first book. I love this trilogy and I'm sad that it's over. I can't say enough about the book or series. Except I wish there was just one more
B00CUWWLWG|1|To many adds could grand kids not enjoy:-( NO MORE GAMES LIKE THIS CAN'T ENJOY TO MANY ADDS POP UP
6305126062|5|Thought this was a well-written, extremely well directed movie - and would  watch it twice just to see the sizzling dance scene again.  Must go now and  take a cold shower.
B00CTEP7O4|5|Great show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I have loved DowntonAbbey since season 1.  Each season just gets more fantastic.  My only complaint is that the seasons are too. short and we have to wait eternally long for the next season to start!
B005LAIH9K|1|We really enjoyed the first three &#34;American&#34; movies, but this one was way over the top with too much time spent on the ridiculous &#34;Baby sitter&#34; scenes. We are sorry we bought this movie.
B000E33VWW|1|Ok, I know this movie has received tons of kudos, but I myself can't really for the life of me see why. I read \\"In Cold Blood\\", and have enjoyed all of Truman Capote's works, but this movie literally put me to sleep. I'm a huge fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman, but egads! I felt a need to get up and slap the TV set from having to listen to his indecipherable verbalizations! I could scarcely understand a word he said, frankly! The whole thing was just a plodding, sluggish, boring, lackluster movie for me. I only stuck it out because I'd paid for the rental!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Don't like being timed out and being nickel and dime. Great game otherwise.
B0038QGXHW|5|I became a fan of Keith Jarrett's years ago after hearing \\"The Melody At Night With You\\", which like \\"Jasmine\\" was recorded in Jarrett's home studio. \\"Jasmine\\" won me over with the first song, Jarrett and Charlie Haden's nearly ten minute version of \\"For All We Know\\". The last minute and a half of this song is simply some of the most beautiful and heart wrenching music I have ever heard. It impresses me on two levels: the interplay between Haden and Jarrett is instinctive and amazing, and the sheer beauty of Jarrett moving up octaves (until you're fooled several times into thinking the song is over when it isn't) is enough to bring tears to my eyes every time I hear it. It seems to me that most of the debate about the quality of this album centers around Jarrett's tendency to vocalize while he plays, his ego, the quality of the recording itself, and where this music stands in terms of both the musician's careers. I would agree that both Jarrett and Haden have made music that is more groundbreaking and challenging than \\"Jasmine\\" both together and seperately in their long careers, but does that make their release of an album of standards pointless, saccharine, and not worth hearing by comparison? In my opinion it does not. This is not free jazz or the \\"Koln Concert\\" album, and it wasn't meant to be! While Jarrett's vocalizations are a matter of taste, (I for one don't particularly enjoy them), they don't detract from the playing on this album in my opinion. For one thing, they are somewhat in the background on this recording due to the microphone placement; I have heard recordings where they are much more prominent and distract from Jarrett's playing. Again, they are present on a few of the songs but not every one, and I have heard worse from Jarrett on other albums. Other reviewers have commented that they don't like the \\"dry\\" recording quality; to me this is another matter of taste. I found the manner in which \\"Jasmine\\" was recorded to be appropriate in that the lack of reverb made the performances sound more intimate, which makes sense for a collection of love songs. Lastly, giving a beautiful collection of songs like this one or two stars on Amazon because you find Jarrett's ego to be a turn off is in my opinion unnecessary as it does not reflect on the music. I have seen Jarrett play live at Carnegie Hall, and he does seem to have a huge ego, a pretentious streak, and a nasty side. However, in the jazz world (or for that matter, any form of the arts) that is not uncommon. Not to mention that while I did not care for his personality the night I saw him, his playing was more than exceptional, and he also gave the audience their money's worth and did seven or eight encores. If you listen to \\"Jasmine\\" at face value, I cannot imagine that it would be a turn off to the average listener. It is a beautiful, pensive, relaxing, and moving collection of songs, and I would recommend it to any lover of jazz.k of reverb made the performances sound more intimate, which makes sense for a collection of love songs.

B001FB5634|5|Nice product and good service.
B000068PQ0|4|glad to see the $$$ hasnt gone to thier heads...the lips rule.
B000069HKH|2|First of all, where is the E Street Band. This murky sounding mess has none of the great sax, guitar and piano play of the great E Street albums. It sounds like just studio musicians from the Human Touch era. If you want great classic Bruce, get the &quot;Live in NYC&quot; cd where the E Street Band does its thing.<BR>I was not expecting &quot;Born to Run&quot; (we'll never get that again)<BR>but it sure would be nice if Bruce would sing about things like  barefoot girls sitting on the hood of a Dodge rather than big worldly events. Its Bruce and therefore better than most, but not great Bruce.
B00NEQRNVG|5|I so loved the book however I was /am a little worried about the relationship.  Why won't Corrine leave them alone?  What I don't like about this book and all of the seris is that they are soooo good that I read them too fast.  I read this book in two days!!  Can't wait for the last book.  A personal plea to Sylvia Day, Please let this super couple live happily ever after.
B007R11DKQ|5|Move over Princess Bride, there is a new star in once upon a time movies. Great story, maybe a bit scary for really young kids.
B002IFT1ZA|5|I can be somewhat of a recluse and so don't tend to engage too much in the likes of television very often, I prefer box sets... less ads!  So I wasn't privy to the hype that surrounded the approach of the release of this show, of which I have heard there was much of.  I found it by accident in my tiny small town Tasmanian DVD rental store.  I'm a long time fan of Sean Bean and have a tendency to froth at the mouth at the prospect of some buckling of swashes, so I thought to myself... \\"well why not!?\\"  I was not disappointed.  From the onset of the highly and fanstastically orchestrated title sequence I was powerfully drawn in to the high quality nature of the production.  The music is subtle, driving yet never heavy handed, the performances are impeccable as well as believably written, the action and political intrigue kept me bound to the screen, the set pieces squeal high quality and lightness of touch and the locations are almost characters in themselves.  Like Lord of the Rings meets the Tudors except... dare I say it, better!  Big call I know and I'm sure there will be many that dissagree, but this reviewer simply doesn't care.  I found this show to be deeply satisfying all round.  The only hole I could find was the dwarfs very occasional accent slip, but he was such an engaging character that I felt bound to excuse it.  Head and shoulders above recent sword based efforts such as the far too shiny, sloppy and occasionally plain daft 'Immortals'.  Watch on and have your swashes well and truly buckled!<br />[[ASIN:B007KTEFSC The Dastardly Mr Winkle Meets His Match (The Green Man)]]
0670021652|2|I couldn't wait to buy the book because I had seen Elizabeth Gilbert on \\"The Bonnie Hunt Show\\" around the time the book came out. The author was talking about all this great history of marriage and her findings about how her attitude changed with age and getting to know herself without pressure from family/friends etc. Having gone through similar relationship and divorce issues I wanted a book with how women fall into social pressures, changing attitutes on marriage, cultural practices and just a general non-fiction social history book. I was disappointed.  The interview was so much better than the book. I skimmed over 60% of it because it wasn't at all interesting but read and then googled to find more information about the history and social/cultural attitudes on marriage.    This would be a book to skim over in Barnes and Nobel on a saturday. Not to buy.
B003UESJFG|5|My wife and son saw this in the theater when it was out and both of them really liked it.  We decided to buy the movie when it came out on Blu Ray.  I am a huge fan of the combo packs that include the DVD as well.  My wife and son did not steer my wrong with this one.  This was a very good movie and an excellent story.  I put this one right up there with the best of the Pixar movies.

185326895X|1|I wanted to read/examine the complete works of William Shakespeare in a single volume and I made an idiot's mistake of purchasing one of these editions without fully checking out the interior of the volume. (Note: this is an issue, but Amazon seems to have the inclination to lump reviews of all editions/versions of a particular kind together. For instance, I am reviewing the Wordsworth Editions of the Complete Works of William Shakespeare, yet this review may end up on the Oxford. Beware reading positive reviews of a certain edition/version without realizing that it may not apply to the edition or version you are getting.)<br /><br />So imagine my dismay opening up the Wordsworth Editions of the Complete Works and seeing such tiny, tiny lettering all bunched up together in two separate columns on each page. It's so small, I'm going to need magnifying glasses if I want to read it! Magnifying glasses! I don't know what other editions are like, but I fear this may be a problem with wanting a single volume of William Shakespeare's works. So for clear reading of the text without magnifying glasses, I fear you may need to purchase these plays separately or in a multi-volume edition. This is just horrible, horrible, horrible.
0062059998|5|I loved this so much. I loved the first, liked the second, and now it's right back to love! Great book. Easy read.
B005ZUR724|4|Unplayable due to an update that is nowhere to be found.  The iPhone version never treated me this way.  I hope they give me reason to change my mind  UPDATE:  The title has been updated and is now playable, touch controls aren't as sharp as Apple ports, but it is a great MMORPG for mobile users.  So far, it is the only title of this kind I will be playing outside of full fledged PC titles.
B000J103WK|5|Very nice - Great sound and Excellent visuals in HD-DVD  Maybe the best band ever!
B005EL6SUG|5|**As of November 2012, Lego listed this product as &#34;Retiring Soon&#34; and was, itself, sold out of the set. Supplies remain available here and there, but you should expect prices to begin to rise above MSRP. **<br /><br />I am the nut-job parent that you'll see in some of the other train reviews. I grew up with Lego and returned to it when I had kids. Obviously I am terribly partial to Lego (ignore my star rating), but I'll give you the best review I can so that you can make the decision that is right for your kids. I do not receive free sets or compensation for my Lego reviews. This set began trickling into U.S. stores in early July, 2011.<br /><br />A tidy and nicely designed set, 3677 includes a heavy switching engine (similar to a Deutsche Bundesbahn Class 290 diesel locomotive), a small green and white hazardous waste boxcar (with a pallet of lime green barrels), tipping ballast car, and maintenance-of-way (MOW) flatcar (which has a small cab, MOW truck, small crane and pallet).  The MOW truck has flip-down rail wheels.  There is also a trackside conveyor belt loader for the ballast, a trackside hopper, and four mini-figures.<br /><br />The set includes all the necessary Power Function parts (i.e., it is a remotely controlled, motorized train) and requires only batteries. The red battery box (a new color for this part) holds six AAA batteries and sits inside the engine. Lego also included the gray battery cover as a spare. If you don't like changing out AAAs, you can opt for the more expensive rechargeable lithium-ion battery and DC charger available directly from Lego. The lithium-ion battery has a gray cover, but if you are handy you can swap the covers using a small screwdriver. The set includes 16 pieces of curved track, 8 pieces of straight track, and 16 pieces of flex track (enough for an oval).<br /><br />This set sits between 7938 and 7939 in price, but may have the most playability of the three.  I find that kids love all the trains and naturally expand them with their own bricks and mini-figures, but this set has a bit more going on than the other two. While 7939 gives you two switches and a crane, with 3677's maintenance car, ballast car/loader, and hazardous waste car, there are more plot lines available (inevitably kids will stage a crash regardless of the train you buy).<br /><br />I like the engine design; it is the latest in a long line of Lego switching engines, the most recent being #4512 from 2003, and one of the most classic being #7760 from 1980. This new engine is very long and has a lift-off top to access the cab. The louvered doors on the side open to reveal engine controls (a sticker). My favorite part of the set is the brown tipper wagon. The green and white boxcar is merely okay.  I don't like how the double doors overhang the end when they are open; a single door would have been fine.  As for the MOW flatcar, I would have preferred a car that was a piece of MOW machinery (e.g. a ballast spreader) or carried something other than a truck (perhaps a flatcar full of rails). The MOW flatcar has a small cab with a hinged roof.<br /><br />I do recommend that you purchase #7936, Level Crossing, which has another Maintenance of Way vehicle that ties-in perfectly with 3677.<br /><br />Not many stores routinely carry Lego trains and even fewer have them built for you to view.  I recommend going to Youtube and doing a search for &#34;Lego 3677 brickshopholland&#34; so that you can get a better feel for this set. If you want to get a complete overview of what Lego offers for trains, you can go to the Lego site (go to the &#34;Shop&#34; and organize by &#34;theme&#34;) or you can click on my name, go to my Amazon page, choose the &#34;Guides&#34; tab, and then choose &#34;Get a Lego Train.&#34;ni-figures, but this set has a bit more going on than the other two.

B00AREIAI8|5|I always wanted a horse, but this is a distant second. The interface is responsive and the minigames are nice.
B00M25DDQE|4|I don't  know if I want Lucy's powers or not. But this is go ride. I love how it folows Lucy as she grows in her power and strugels to understand what is happening to he. For me, the car chase was a waste of time. And I love 'destroy 50 cars' chasses. It acctualy takes away from the movie. It does not showcase her enhanced driving skills, or help the story in any way.
B000R9OFLO|4|I fully expected a book this old to be a bit less than what was described as condition.  Was I wrong!  Although the dust jacket had been taped (expected for an item of this age) it was still intact and the cover of the actual book is like new.  I'm impressed with this seller and will surely order again if they are one that offers what I seek.
B004J4WKUQ|5|Some of the writing is a bit cheesy in it's attempt to be &#34;nerdy&#34;, but the story is very compelling and well written overall.
B005WUHAX8|1|This case might be made for good reason..but it will not fit alot of cases..and if you carry a purse..you have to put it in with other stuff (to bulky for pockets..on purses or person.)<br />Sorry...Make a thinner Case....with all the benefits...Hey, they can put a man on the MOON  !!!
B0054JZC6E|5|I love it very much it is fun you can play almost what ever ypu want and it is fun to chalnge yourself and beat your high score
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Once you start watching you want to know what next.  Can't wait until middle of Sept. for Season 4 to see who does what.
0312611692|4|I had already borrowed this book from the library - 3 times! - when I decided I needed it as a permanent reference. The book arrived timely and in the condition expected. Why the West Rules--for Now looks at history in a different way than the school texts I remember. In addition to also covering events in China that I had never heard of, events in the &#34;West&#34; are given a very different weight. Agree, or disagree: This book is thought provoking.
B00B8M4IMK|5|I bought this so that I could charge my iPhone and iPad at the same time, or two phones – especially useful during road trips. It charges the batteries faster than the wall plug (8W), because each port seems to juice at 12W (more like the iPad adapter).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs to charge multiple devices at once.
B00466HM28|4|I love this product cause its plug and play. Also its very portable. The only negative things i can say is (1. that the pads are kind of tuff 2.The keys are kind of small and not lightweight as they say on the box. Besides that its cool and good to go. I use it right now while im deployed and its nice. I mean with lil space anyway at least there is no excuse for not keeping my hobby going and making a couple dollars.
B0009XNUK0|4|When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their \\"The Essential...\\" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his \\"not guilty\\" verdict.<br /><br />If this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and \\"Thriller\\" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.<br /><br />If you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though \\"I'll Be There\\" and \\"Dancing Machine\\" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit \\"You Are Not Alone\\" and the 2001 Top Ten single \\"You Rock My World\\".<br /><br />As with most if not all entries in the \\"Essential\\" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that \\"Thriller\\" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as \\"I'll Be There\\", \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\", \\"Dancing Machine\\", \\"Ease On Down The Road\\", the Paul McCartney \\"Say, Say, Say\\" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), \\"State Of Shock\\" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.umber ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), \\"State Of Shock\\" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream.

0767802519|1|Well I don't know it was scratched up and I couldn't even get past the beginning.
6303589162|1|...Not only does it derive the entire story from Hitchcock movies, but its also graphically violent and  sensationalist where Hitchcock would have used subtlety, the scene where a  woman is killed with a POWER DRILL is pobably the best example of DePalma's  second rate abiilities as a director...Do youself a favor and get one of his better movies like  carlito's way, the untouchables or mission impossible. Or even better buy  Vertigo or Rear window,...ever major scene in the movie has pretty much been derived  from an older and better movie.
B006LSZECO|5|Amazing
B00V4JJFN4|4|Eh... not my favorite but I will take it... and I will probably watch again
B00BPA2PFM|3|Nice

B001LF347E|5|this show gives everyone access to  the legend of Camelot. It's just fun watching and always leaves the viewer with hope for a better world.
B007V508CC|5|Maroon 5 is one of the rare bands left today where EVERY song is good!  Just when you think the CD couldn't get any better you listen to the last son which is their version of Prince's KISS!  Awesome ...
B00000897V|5|Incredible progressive metal with stunning vocals and guitars. If you like Queensryche or Dream Theater, you will love Virgin Steele.

My only criticizm is that sometimes there is a slight speech delay (voice first, mouth movement second)  Random occurences so I can't say it happens with every viewing.
B0068PHS5Q|4|A beautiful story, with plenty of twists and turns
B00E0OK2X2|4|Super fun little game. Kind of awkward at some points, especially on the two thumb game. Overall, fun and enjoyable.<br /><br />Psst, for those confused by the pause screen, you just keep your thumbs on the screen and move them to restart play.
B000GPIPT2|5|Never mind the movie - we all know it was great - no one mentioned the packaging....FANTASTIC - a real collector's item
B00280LYIC|4|I really enjoyed this book.  It took a little while to get into, but once you get immersed in the world, you won't want to leave it.
B00K0OI42W|4|Classic
B001CTDH4Y|5|This movie is so cute & humorous!  I really enjoyed it all the way.  Dog lovers will especially love it.  Even if as an adult you don't laugh out loud, you can't help but smile. Cleverly promotes pet adoption too.  Only drawback is on the menu set-up.  This movie has both full & widescreen presentations on one side, but there is no obvious widescreen choice in looking at the main menu.  To access widescreen, you either need to click on audio commentary (you don't have to leave it on) or click on the scene selection you want and there you will be given a FS or WS choice.
B005XN0SGU|5|Ok I rarely do reviews on apps cause its just not worth my time to review everything I get, but after getting Perfect Viewer I am so happy with everything it does so I can read my comical on my kindle. Pictures great and the zoom in is very handy at times. Well worth 3 bucks.
B0057O6IDW|5|if you like harecore gory stuff, this movie is full of it. it may seem a little slow at first, but like any other movie its just building up the story, so dont give up on it. a awesome horror movie, no doubt about it.
B005MJFA2W|5|This book provides a simple framework with far reaching benefits to anyone wishing to understand or change any aspect of their emotional disposition or behavior. It is written in a clear pragmatic style that contrasts favorably with the obscure, overly complicated and professionally mystifying styles of most academic articles in this field and it provides a very useful lens for many professional practices.
B004ZMWUCU|4|Good read, not totally predictable.  Connected with the characters. Felt that the transition from past to present made it easier to stomach the abuse but still be affected by it.
B008J34466|3|Could have been in better condition
B00DQEB1V4|5|Great pen!!!
B007HJ9LXE|5|Salma Hayek does an incredible job of transforming herself into Frida Kahlo, body, mind and soul.  We believe she can paint, We believe she is injured.  We feel her pain,  She IS Frida Kahlo, Much the same for Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera.  This film is riveting, the music is beautiful, the scenes dramatic.  You cannot take your eyes away from the screen/.  The music is incredible.  I loved it!
B002OFWG7E|5|Great nice cd for a fair price with all of my favorite songs it has everlong the pretender and times like these
B000ID1J0E|1|I wasted my time and money on this terrible movie. I thought it was be interesting and it was just odd.
B001DCZ4IW|5|One needs an unusual sense of humor to truly appreciate this movie. One of my favorites from that era. The Cat Stevens sound track is classic.
0393324818|5|I picked this book up, thinking it would be a great sports read.  It turned out to be one of the most insightful business books I've ever read - whose principles can be applied to valuing businesses, real estate, individuals (baseball, in this case - but also football recruiting, which is my passion). <br />Michael Lewis captured so much in this great book!
B00CWY76CC|5|I love the app but it is 2 short so maybe lengthen it but love the app five stars love it
B0045HCJRQ|5|I've loved this movie for years, now I have my own! :)
B001UV4XJ2|5|Easily the best movie in the series.  A must see for all Harry Potter fans whether you have seen the rest of them or not.
B007J4T2G8|5|Great Book, much better then I ever expected. Its not a typical story for me to read but the intensity truly had me hanging on to the next word... I can relate in soo many ways.
1439181780|4|...The secret works and the more you read and learn, the better you become at getting what you want. you could have read Think and Grow Rich over and over and would have gotten to the same result, ot takes practice and knowledge till it CLICKS. exactly like a guitar, youneed to learm and practice and learn and pratice till you GET IT. there is nothing wrong with scret or all the others. once it satrts working youdont need to buy any other book but untill then, it pays to learn. justlike an education. u need to invest time and money, unless you re one of the few lucky ones who intuitively got it.
B00000IL1K|5|An otherwordly paradise-like affect, complete with a sitar, sets the stage for Eden, a worthy followup to Sarah's masterpiece, Time To Say Goodbye.<br />The three covers on this album are Hooverphonic's &quot;Eden&quot;, Kansas' &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; and Celine Dion's &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; only this song is sung in Italian as &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va&quot;, making it more exotic and intriguing.  It starts out in her pop voice before blooming in its full glory in her resonant operatic vocal at the emotionally climactic part of the song.<br />The medieval choir and Sarah's voice makes her rendition of &quot;Eden&quot; far superior than the original by Hooverphonic.<br />&quot;Bailero&quot; is an effective interlude that precedes the two other cover songs, which are back-to-back, by the way.  The same thing is achieved with &quot;Scene D'Amour&quot;, which bridges the emotionally potent &quot;Only An Ocean Away&quot; and &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;.  The crescendo that is reached when she sings the chorus is similar to the emotional climax in &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va&quot; but with lesser effect.<br />&quot;Deliver Me&quot; began life here before becoming such a theme in the movie Brokedown Palace.  More mainstream people who expect Eden or any of her other albums to be like &quot;Deliver Me&quot; had better have an appreciation of her opera voice.<br />The Richard Marx-penned &quot;The Last Words You Said&quot; closes the album and is a precious nugget wrapped around lush string arrangements.<br />Vocal styles:  Her lovely opera voice is put to great effect on &quot;Anytime, Anywhere&quot;, &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va&quot;, &quot;Nella Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Lascia Ch'io Pianga&quot;, and Puccini's &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;  Everything else is in her pop voice.<br />As on her post-Fly albums, an orchestra boosts her lovely vocals, and on Eden, it is the English National Orchestra.  While I place this below Time To Say Goodbye and La Luna, Eden still has its special place in paradise.l place in paradise.
B007A4SDCG|5|But at some point I loaned it to someone. Yeah I know...I've said that so many times, Never lend a book you don't want to lose.  Anyway it's on my kindle now and I'll be able to refer to it whenever I want. I just want to paint...
B001AQO3QA|5|This is a MUST-OWN for any Aliens enthusiast. You can see the pores on Ripley's face, the terror in Hudsons eyes, the desperation of the original crew, and the unseen terrors of the unprocessed extra! It's a treasure!
B00005B36H|4|ok, i've listened to two songs and already it sounds just like Ænima.  that's ok.  i like Ænima.<br />what i want to know is...how can the art work matter?  is this empty-v talking here?  thinking artwork will make music better is like thinking robert smith's hair and lipstick somehow had anything at all to do with the cure's music all these years.<br />ahhh...poor children, products of too much empty-v watching.  try to just *listen* to the music.  don't *look* at it.<br />anyway, this album is a bit more dreamy than Ænima and the mix seems kinda...weird.  mjk's voice isn't as prominent.  mantra is great, seeing as i'm a big fan of lustmord/köner/robert rich type music as well.
B007IXWL2C|5|Love being able to read anywhere..dark or very bright, I had NO problems.THUMBS UP..Thank you<br />I will be getting more books soon....
B006FTC6ZC|5|&#34;Tucker and Dale vs Evil&#34; is comedy horror gold. In this case, it takes the classic model of &#34;crazy hillbilly killers in the wild&#34; and completely turns it on its head, with side-splitting results. The titular Tucker and Dale are two good old boys looking to enjoy a weekend fishing and fixing up their new cabin they purchased (a fixer-upper, to put it lightly). They can be a bit dim-witted in some regards, and are simple people from simple backgrounds, but they are also good, honest, hardworking individuals who value the friendship they share and are extremely likable. Meanwhile, some college kids happen to also be camping nearby, who are rather full of themselves and disdainful (and fearful) of hillbilly types. When an accident at a lake at night results in our two heroes saving a young woman from the college kids' group, it sets off a series of events that first convinces the girls' &#34;friends&#34; that she has been kidnapped. Following a botched rescue attempt, the clueless kids become convinced our pair are just a bunch of deranged killers, even though it's entirely the dumb kids accidentally killing themselves! Things just escalate and get out of hand from there. It's great fun watching all the ways the kids manage to kill themselves, and manage to convince themselves it's the fault of the rednecks. It reverses what you'd expect about who is the hero and who is the villain, as well as who is smart and who is dumb.
B000FBJF6Y|4|I normally don't read who dunnits  but this book is more. There is depth of character and I learned about a culture  very diffrent than ours. It is a quick read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B004P12SSW|4|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  Plot is nothing new but the cast did a great job.  Cher is still looking superb and love the yummy bartender.
B00DAXXO98|5|Cogressman Frank Underwood (brilliantly played by Kevin Spacey) does whatever it takes to climb the political ladder and get what he wants. The series opens with him speaking directly to the camera as he deals with a dog hit by a car. It's not pretty, and it only gets more vicious and vile as the season unfolds. Underwood uses everyone, including his wife, who is more or less the female version of him. The newly elected president of the USA passes Underwood over for the job of secretary of state and the balls starts rolling faster and faster downhill as Underwood manipulates everyone for his purposes. An upstart reporter becomes his concubine and mouthpiece. An alcoholic congress becomes a tool. And even his wife has to pay the price along the way. There are very few redeeming characters in this show. They are either part of the problem or not willing to be part of the solution. Cynical and debauched, this show makes you wonder: Is this what it's really like in Washington, D.C.?
B000002MP2|5|i have a couple of other Green Day cds but by far this is my favorite because so of it is true punk and other is pop-punk but all around it is the greatest Green Day cd ever
B004DLPXAO|4|Quite enjoyed picking up straight where I last read. I've also read a couple of books I would not have thought to look at twice.
B0088RQ4X4|3|Not a bad fantasy-action movie ... but also not a very good one.<br /><br />There's fun action, but at the end of the day, this is the kind of movie you have on while napping on your couch on a rainy Saturday.  There's no real reason to seek out this thing.  It's not as bad as the critics say, and not nearly as good as the amazon reviewers say.
B000000OA6|5|If you know the story of Queen then you'd know that this album, released in 1991, was the last one released while lead singer Freddie Mercury was alive. Sentimentality reasons make this the greatest Queen album for me, and the tracks back it up as well <br /> <br />Innuendo - Great opener. much different style for Queen. 10/10 <br /> <br />I'm Going Slightly Mad - fun lyrics. Video is also fun. 10/10 <br /> <br />Headlong - nice rocker featuring great guitar work. 9/10 <br /> <br />I Can't Live With You - another nice up-tempo rocker. 9/10 <br /> <br />Don't Try So Hard - very moving song with great lyrics. 10/10 <br /> <br />Ride The Wild Wind - close your eyes and listen to this and you can picture yourself in the song. great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />All God's People - many fans don't like this song but I think it's a nice change of pace with some good lyrics. 9/10 <br /> <br />These Are The Days Of Our Lives - extremely moving song. if you watch the video it may bring a tear to your eye. 10/10 <br /> <br />Delilah - again, many fans don't like this song but I think it's fun and brings some color to the otherwise somber album. 9/10 <br /> <br />The Hitman - one of Queen best rock songs ever. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bijou - great guitar, not a lot of lyrics but song is great to listen to. 10/10 <br /> <br />The Show Must Go On - another moving song that'll bring tears to your eyes. Lyrics are haunting and very emotional. 10/10 <br /> <br />this album is definitely a masterpiece and should be in the home of every music fan no matter what genre of music you like. Overall rating: 115/120. Incredible album by the greatest band ever
B00005LOLD|5|\\"Sayonara\\" is a great movie!  The story is compelling, emotional & impactful.  It also has themes that will make one think.  The movie touched my heart.      I had not heard of \\"Sayonara\\" before I \\"came across it\\" on cable television.  Therefore, I assume that it is a movie that has been \\"flying under the radar.\\"  It has all of the qualities of a classic, such as \\"Rocky\\" & \\"Star Wars.\\"  However, for \\"Sayonara\\" to be considered on the same level as other classics, then people have to \\"get the word out.\\"    Marlon Brando & Miiko Taka are superb as the two main characters.  Red Buttons, Miyoshi Umeki, Patricia Owens & Ricardo Montalban are wonderful in their supporting roles.  James Garner (\\"The Great Escape\\" & \\"The Rockford Files\\") is one of my favorite actors & he complements Marlon Brando very well in a supporting role.  I highly recommend \\"Sayonara!\\"
B00EL8JCGU|4|Goof movie, like lots of action.
B009YQJ322|5|Quick to ship and was as described. I will do business with them again for sure in the future. Nice
B0085OELXK|2|With such an incredible cast, we thought: we can't lose watching this. Plus we'd heard so many good things. And really, the movie itself was pretty good. But the ending is just so lame...this film ends up being a total letdown.
B00DDTQE1Y|1|Gosh app developers that posted every single positive review, why didn't you mention it cures STDs as well.  Pretty awesome.  All kidding aside, absurd permission requirements, ckunky interface and poorly executed controls and features.  Every pro review is planted and bogus.  Every one of them.
B00000ILDF|3|I remember when my dad took my older brother and sister to see this movie. They were VERY excited, because all of us enjoyed the first two movies. Sadly, they came home disgusted that night after paying almost $10.00 a person to see the first screening, and I really can't blame them.<br />What's so bad? Well, first off, Alien 3 had a very weak script. The main characters die off right when the movie begins. Characters from \\"Aliens\\" (The 2nd movie) like Hicks and Newt, who you grew to love. Talk about shock value. As the movie progresses, we're treated to listening to a bunch of fowl mouthed prison inmates who you don't quite care about anyway. Ripley gets close to one of the inmates in particular, but he's killed off rather quickly. Oh, and did I mention she now has an Alien inside of her? I guess paying good money to see this movie with high hopes could be considered the equivalent of being shot and kicked repeatedly while you lie helpless on the ground. I feel for the people who were severely disappointed.<br />I watched this movie quite a bit from the time it was released on video right up until it became a DVD, and even on television a couple of times. What intriques me about this movie? Unlike the 4th installment, it stayed true to the dark brooding horror which is what the first 2 films captured. Alien 3 was very dark. After your mind accepts the faults over a period of time, you're able to appreciate it a little more. Ripley's selfless act at the very end of the movie, the emotional and not to mention enthusiastic speeches given by Ripley and the inmates, the music. It's a depressing film to some, and everybody knows why. But what can you do? I was personally hoping they'd make a 4th installment which canceled Alien 3 out as nothing more then a bad dream in hyper-space, but instead we were given something even more disgusting and a phony/dumbed down version of our main hero who was cloned. But that's another story.
B00T3DNKIE|3|Hard to see how this could have been written BEFORE Mockingbird.
0802473156|5|I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.  If you want to know how to better get along with and understand other people (be that a spouse, a child, a parent, a friend, etc), reading this book will help you.
B007ADIRDM|5|excelente
B002LFPAUC|5|Very funny! I can watch it over and over. John Cleese is brilliantly funny! If you like British humor then this is for you.
0312243022|4|Since the fall of 2001, I have been reading my way through the Pulitzer Prize winning novels and so far this is the best of the lot.  At the end of chapter 3, which are short, I was a little confused but stick with it.  Certainly provides some insights and food for thought.  Not however for someone who is suffering from depression !
B003VANOFY|5|Got this for my cousin for his birthday. He was really glad to get this as he doesn't need to be &#34;tied to the computer&#34; with the cord. However, you can still use it with the cord while it is charging. What he likes best is that you can leave the computer and still communicate with other players in the game. He said to give this a Two Thumbs Up. Since he isn't easy to make happy, I will give this a 5 Star Rating and Highly Recommend This. He did notice that before it had charged up completely, the volume wasn't as loud.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Addicting. Good game to pass the time.
B00D97HPQI|5|I recommend this book for all readers who enjoy thinking about the future role of technology in our society.  The questions of how technological advancement will affect humanity are well presented and thought provoking.
6304383177|5|I saw Bringing Up Baby for the first time just under a month ago, and have since rewatched it about five times. Not only does it stand up to repeated viewings, it seems almost to *require* them; there's no way to absorb everything at one go. The best part is that the funny bits are just as funny on the sixth viewing as they were on the first, if not even funnier, because you've grown to really love the scatter-brained chatterbox Susan, and the befuddled, confused David.<br />It's impossible to imagine anyone else playing either Susan or David: Hepburn and Grant are perfect for their roles, and their characters are perfect (foils) for each other. Most people would consider Hepburn a dramatic actress, largely because of her later body of work (e.g. The Lion In Winter). But BUB proves she is a dazzling, charming comedienne, well able to go toe-to-toe with the funniest men in the business. Grant is wonderfully generous in allowing her to dominate the movie by playing the straight man, and he does so wonderfully as well.<br />Watch this for Hepburn, watch this for Grant, watch this for Hepburn *and* Grant... and, oh yes, watch it for the leopard. ;)
B002W7H3EA|5|Every time I watch this movie, it always thrills me. They just don't make these kind of movies any more.
0544340620|5|Good
B0050DIWFC|4|very good read, although no firm conculsion at end of story
0385342020|4|I am completely unable to resist a new Sophie Kinsella book. I always really like them; they're romantic and funny and you can read them in a day. Twenties Girl is easily my new favorite of all her books. I loved Sadie (the ghost), loved to hate Natalie, Josh and Uncle Bill, and (of course) had a crush on American Frown. I really liked the research the author did on the 1920's and enjoyed the interesting anecdotes she sprinkled throughout the story. I spent this Sunday in my pajamas, curled up with the cats reading this, and I am really glad I did. It was funny and relaxing.
B006X96PF6|5|Revised to a 5 from a three after comment below my original...<br /><br />Original - It is a nice CD, but a number of repeat songs I have on several other CDs.  Not sure I would have bought the whole thing, I should have gotten the few new songs off of iTunes.
B006YTTVHO|4|Proven ideas to rething the way you talk to people and what to say at difficult times makes this book a staple in your library.
B00HCMG6LG|5|I really enjoy this game. There is just enough to make it fun without making it so difficult that it becomes frustrating.
B001GJ7E9E|5|Love to hate, hate to love. Who do you hate and should you love....LOL entertaining from beginning to end
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is adorable, and addictive. My whole family (or there about) plays this game, and we compare high scores.
B00E8B1P9M|1|NO AUDIO.
B000PKG7I4|5|Amy's voice was much smoother on this album to me and I can understand what she is saying... doesn't sound drunk on this album.
B00DURGZHW|5|Modern Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer flavored drama with nothing but praise for all the cast.  A classic to be savored.
0345528581|4|I thought this would be a great way to exercise any place any time.  The first chapters are really good; he reiterates that muscle mass burns calories all the time and gives as much science as I can tolerate on getting the best results with the least and most efficient actions.  I'm all for that!  And I learned a way to build toward a regular push up when I have all my life only been able to do a &#34;girl's&#34; push up from on my knees.  So all in all I think this is a very good book; the exercises are illustrated well, you can start as easy as you want and build on existing exercises to an advanced level.  You are not overwhelmed with the number of exercises.  His defined regimens tell you exactly how to start and progress.<br /><br />The only issue I have is that while you may not need equipment per se, I think equipment would help.  Some of his set ups used props that I didn't have in my house:  chair is too low, table is too high--I don't have large speakers that are just right.  Also, I am only 130 lbs, but pulling with my whole body weight on a door made me scared I'd eventually pull the hinges loose.  He does, however, use body weight and leverage to get results without having to buy a set of weights or clutter your house, and you can get by without buying anything.  Plus, he uses exercises that hit many muscles at once so the workout is shorter.<br /><br />I also like the fact that he is not a celebrity trainer, that he is expert in training for strength, health, and performance.  He has developed the quickest route to fitness because it was his job in the military.  He's credible.
B000SXLL8O|5|Love this band,they are amazing. Every song they put out is amazing. I would say everyone should check them out.
B00DVKOYBM|4|Good way to pass the time.
B00DPM7TIG|3|Will written by the author wasn't my favorite sorta confusing
B004EBZX6W|5|Great app for, troubleshooting wireless networks, signal strength and channel issues. Especially if there are a bunch of networks you don't have control of.
B0000009SF|5|I love Frank Zappa's instrumental/experimental period from the late 60's/early 70's.  That's probably why I love the Grand Wazoo.  While I haven't heard the entire disc, I can safely say this is one mighty fine album.  These instrumental jams are atmospheric, adventurous and as creative as a jam can possibly be.  The way Frank Zappa used to write music is just really incredible.  Being experimental really *is* the way to go, for long-lasting satisfaction.  While Hot Rats is his masterpiece, the Grand Wazoo is probably his next best album.  Jamming done right!
B00005Y7AW|5|There's not much more to say about this album that hasn't been said already. It's fabulous. It's brillantly written and performed. I listen to it in the car, at work, at home. It's absolutely in my top five favorite LPs of all time. My favorite tracks are &quot;Greek Song&quot;, &quot;Poses&quot;, and &quot;Rebel Prince&quot;.
B00000INEX|5|My daughter loved Baby Mozart and Baby Bach from the time she was 6 months to about 18 months.  Nothing else would hold her attention as long as one of these short but educational videos.  We normally wouldn't have let her watch a video as much as we let her watch these.  The music is pleasant (can't beat the classics!), the colors are enticing, the skits short enough to hold her attention, and always educational.  She learned many words based upon objects within this video series.<br />She did seem to lose interest in Baby Mozart and Baby Bach as she reached about 18 months and became more interested in the Dr. Dolittle World Animals and Neighborhood Animals.
B004MC0FO8|1|They Got Ad Mad worse than Face Blast or whatever that thing is called now.
B00688628M|5|Great series. Enjoyed the storyline and lots of action
B008133DO8|5|I don't have anything bad to say about this TV series. Both seasons were amazing and the last episode left me hanging. I'll be happy if the third season is half as good as the second.
B00DXP7L88|5|To wrap up the story in twelve episodes or chapters, that’s short, that’s fast, but that’s radical, &agrave; la Dexter. He manages to solve a ton of problems in these twelve episodes.<br /><br />First he finds a surrogate mother for Harrison, and that was difficult to find. Luckily the only woman he had loved and that was still alive, apart from his sister turns up and re-activates some fundamental mechanisms. And Harrison likes her. She is very special but she wants to become a good girl.<br /><br />He manages to solve the problem of his father and how his father, a good cop, could accept his adoptive son to become a criminal, how he managed to come up with the code, etc. In fact the symbolical mother surrogate of his, of Dexter, comes up to him and reveals who she is and what she did. She reveals that his father OD’ed on his heart drug when he could not stand what Dexter had become any more. Dexter hates that doctor Vogel that has nothing of a bird in that story, at most a vulture but that is no  bird you try to attract in your garden with a bird feed and a bird bath.<br /><br />He has to solve a last case of a serial killer who is aiming at both him and Doctor Vogel. Her past is revealed and she becomes extremely dark and deep with one son killed by another, you know the story of Cain and Abel. And the killing son is sent East of Eden in some institution in England, or something far to the East. And there he is tortured into medical blankness since he is a criminal who deserves to be punished even if it is with drugs or some archaic violent treatment like electric shocks or other forceful manipulations of the body or the brain, and why not the mind and the imagination.<br /><br />Of course the dear son who was buried alive in this institution plans a good case of arson, with seven dead people in the wing that burns, and himself among these seven, officially, because’ in fact he manages to get out, change identities and then move on, looking for mummy, Doctor Vogel, and all those she preferred to him, and first of all Dexter. And the blood trail can start under the police identity of the “brain surgeon” because he saws up the skull of his victim in a very special way and scoops out one very precise section of the brain and delivers these extracted sections to his mummy. A yummy appetizer for Christmas dinner or Thanksgiving celebrations.<br /><br />He of course has to save his sister from private investigation and then to make her a star in the Police Department. So he finally comes over his need to kill with his last victim and gives him over to Deborah for her to arrest him. But a Federal Marshall comes up and he completely messes the case, frees the criminal who kills him straight away, takes his gun, shoots Deborah who shoots him but in vain. And things will not turn honky dory and there will be some complications. Dexter then has to close up the file and clean up the plate. Deborah disappears in a hurricane.<br /><br />Finally he has to take care of himself and to protect Harrison and the substitute mother who has taken the boy to South America, and there is only one way. So he disappears with his boat into the hurricane. A tempestuous ending but it works.<br /><br />And yet they more or less kept one card up their sleeves, I mean the producers, for a sequel in let’s say five or ten years, when Harrison reaches teenage and starts moving towards finding his father and recuperating the father model he needs and remembers from his tumultuous first four years. Check amm by yourselves with the DVDs how they manage to keep one bun in the oven in slow gestation.<br /><br />You can always dream. But it is sure the author of the book series will be able to go on working with Dexter if he wants, though the last volume was announced a long time ago and will maybe finally come out next March (2014) and it is supposed to be entitled Dexter’s Final Cut, which promises quite some blood.<br /><br />We’ll see. Que sera sera. Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? What will be, will be!<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUa. Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? What will be, will be!<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B001NHNG64|4|Not the best, not the weakest. It took a while to really follow this one. It was a slow read.
B004EFYZ1C|5|Accurate and easy to use,  nice app .
B00CBRAD2A|5|This movie was actually really good. It was funny and full of action, just like you want to see it with Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br />I thought it did better at the box office. I really enjoyed it.
B0083Z6AH6|4|I enjoyed this novel.  It took me a few chapters to really get into it and to not confuse the characters.  Once the story got going I couldn't put it down.  I did think the ending was a bit abrupt. If it had been my story I would have guided the reader to the end a little more gently.
B00UC9EXKW|5|Great album, full of energy and thought.
B00NFQSW1U|5|Excellent!
0099489988|5|Charming and warm... I would recommend this book to anyone that appreciates a fun love story.
B00HHYEOY0|5|I have never bought an album by Beck  Have heard many of his songs.  When Koonye messed with him at Grammy show I decided to buy this cd. Thank you Koonye.  I knew if you didn't like him that he had to be good. Beck is a great talent!!
B00E8KLWB4|2|Game is ok; however, I found the search pictures to be very condensed and small making it very, very difficult to find the hidden objects at times. Furthermore, the game will randomly move your objects each time you go back to the same scene (while other games will keep the hidden object in the same place to allow players to compete for better score times). Always randomly moving the hidden objects around makes the game even more difficult. I am not a big fan of that and got tired of the game in a short time...
0920668372|5|My son, now 4.2 yrs, and I have read this book often.  He received it as a gift on his 2nd birthday. He enjoys it and will recall, &quot;I'll love you forever and like you for always, Mommy&quot; when we're together  This book does tug at the emotions of young children as well as Mommy's.  It's also a good jumping off book for talking about aging Grandparents et al.
1607747308|5|Good advice to get everything cleaned up.
B00JVZ0DQG|3|Meh, it's okay
0307346617|5|The way its told as interviews from individuals who lived through it is amazing.  Loved it and as I said finished it in one sitting during first part of flight and the first layover.  If you have a love for zombies you need to own this book.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Done in 3 days. I think James' writing has improved since the originals. I was so glad the whole Inner Goddess BS was done. Christian has thoughts but not nearly as stupid as the waste of ink in the other 3 Fifty books. That series would have easily fit into 2 volumes without it. I also was hoping that &#34;Grey&#34; would wrap up all 3, but I see in the quest for cash, there will probably again be a trilogy. So aside from that, I was glad to get a peek through Christian's eyes...always wondered just how the conversation went with Elena and with his psychiatrist. I do like the Gail and Taylor relationship and was disappointed that it was eliminated from the movie. So, now, waiting for the second volume &#34;Greyer?&#34;  The third, &#34;Greyest?&#34; Since the next 2 are already partially written due to carryover from the originals, let's get them on the market. I have no patience and am about to roll my eyes!
0399213015|4|I know it says miniature edition but this book is REALLY tiny! But for the price it was great and my son has been packing around with him everywhere :)
B005GFPZYK|4|OK
B003IPC5SO|5|First of all let me start by saying that Aphrodite is a very cute title for a dance album, but would have been better suited for an album of love songs. I have this album nevertheless Kylie Minogue's eleventh studio album is a wonderful addition to anyone dance pop lover. The album that i bears a heavy resemblance to is of course her own 2000 album Light Years, she took the same winning formula and just perfected it by a decade. One would only skip tracks on here only to get to their favorite ones. All the Lovers, Everything is Beautiful, Too Much, Aphrodite, and Better Than Today are among the best of an album of great songs.
B00IIJ9F2E|3|I waited awhile to purchase this Blu-ray extended edition because I had the three disc DVD set that was released awhile ago.  The transfer is far, far superior to the DVD release, but it doesn't appear that all the extras have been ported over.  I've tried to navigate the menu and some content is available through the &#34;U-Control&#34; menu, but there seems to be a substantial amount missing- including various 'behind the scenes' documentaries and the deleted scenes.  In actuality, it's hard to imagine getting through all the special features included on the previous release- but I don't like that these companies keep releasing these sub-par collector's editions that ultimately force you to keep your old DVD if you want to retain all the previous extras.  On top of that, the entire concept of &#34;U-Control&#34; is terrible.  Just grant me access to the production art or interviews directly through a basic menu.  It's invasive and jarring to have the movie interrupted with brief snippets of information.  That being said, it's worth the upgrade for the superior picture, but don't throw out those DVD's yet...
B000005Z0E|5|A classic, must have album.  The outrage and anger are real and the lyrics challenge anybody to think about struggling with injustice no matter what your race.
B00I8H6MGS|4|Mathew McConaughey played against type in this film, not sexy, not handsome. He became the character. AIDS isn't in the public eye as much these days. It's easy to forget it's still with us. This film is remarkable enough to view even though you might want to forget about AIDS.<br /><br />I would have given the film five stars except for personal aversions to Texas, a disease I hate, drug enforcement idiocy, dissatisfaction with standard medical care, and others.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I read books all the time and I love it when I find one that I can not put down, this was one of them. I felt like I really knew the characters, I cried at times and my heart hurt for the characters. I read it all at once and when I was finished, I was happy. I think that's a sign of a good book.
B00EFWU91E|5|If you loved the previous books you will love this one as well, my all time favorite series ever! I love it!
6302636779|4|In a truly great performance, Audrey Hepburn stars as Gabrielle (and later, Sister Luke), a young Belgian girl and daughter of a famous surgeon, who enters the convent with the ultimate dream of working as a nurse in the Belgian Congo.  From the outset, Hepburn has difficulty working within the vow of obedience, and it becomes a daily struggle to remain faithful to her vow.  The struggle becomes more pronounced in the Congo when working with Peter Finch, a brilliant surgeon who sees her conflict but is not a believer.  Hepburn and Finch have a relationship that is one of the highlights of this film.  The Nun's Story is not an action packed feature, but rather a character study about coming to grips with one's faith, character, and true self.  Hepburn does a terrific job of portraying Sister Luke's conflicts, all the more difficult given the emotional restraint she must show in the role of a nun. The supporting cast of film veterans adds to the excellence of the acting.  I also enjoyed the insight into the training and demands placed on nuns.  The level of sacrifice required surprised me, and although it's not an experience that most of us will ever have ourselves, there's much about human nature that can be appreciated and learned in this film.
B002ZG99A4|1|I like a good (key word) action / adventure as much as the next guy, especially anything with Bruce Willis, Jason Statham or Jet Li, and it's always nice to see Mickey Rourke, but this was just a waste. Maybe I'm just pissed that they wasted so many opportunities for humor, but then Stallone always has taken himself too seriously.
B007TBZ63Y|5|It was cool looking forward to getting house of Hades can't wait to see what happens<br />If percey and Annabeth will make it
0767830555|5|While most of Martin Scorsese work is pretentious garbage, Taxi Driver is a true classic. As a bonus, John Hinckley's infatuation with Jodie Foster (who portrayed Iris, the young hooker) led him to shoot greedy scumbag, Ronald Reagan. That personal opinion aside, this movie is very good and is well worth owning.
B003XQM2YU|4|It was great.
B0071DJZZA|5|The Hunger Games was a great book. I read it in less than a day because I could not put it down for long.
B0084IHVGG|4|Love this movie, brings back great feelings and memories
B0015AARJI|5|The extra controller is a necessary purchase for the PS3 if you plan on playing multi player games.
1400076943|5|This is the story of Kambili, a shy 15 year old Nigerian girl with a rich and strictly religious father who is loved by the community (even receiving an award from Amnesty) and both loved and feared by his children whom he lovingly terrorizes. Kambili and her brother start to realize about the uncommonnes of their situation while staying with their father's poor but independent sister and her children.  This book is about children loving their parents whatever happens and also (but less) about the place and time in which the story was set. In both ways it is an interesting and beautiful story.   The terrible father who wants the best for his family reminded me of Allie Fox in Paul Theroux's Mosquito Coast, although Allie was not so cruel (physically).   If you are interested, like me, in the daily life in other countries and other times the setting is an added bonus.     The story rings so true, as a reader you can understand both the hate and the love and the way Kambili and her brother deal with it so well, that I hope this is just due to Adichie's great gift as a writer.    Compared to Half of a yellow sun (that I read first and also liked very much) I think it is a bit less about hard times in Nigeria and even more about people and the way they survive in emotional hard times. For teenage girls I would recommend Purple Hibiscus because it also is about daughters and fathers and falling in love.    Anyway and anybody (grumpy old man or sweet teenage girl): read it!
B00CHCUR9I|4|Es casi real parece que acabó de ver la serie es muy bueno y de verdad leería los demas sin duda esta kompletamente privado de la indirecta lo que no se t y no se t y no se t y no se t y no se t y no se t y no se t y no se t y no
B006BGZJJ4|5|I love my Kindle. My father-in-law is sick, and needed a replacement Kindle charger and cable. I sent him mine. I didn't want to buy the full new Kindle charger and cable for my Gen II Kindle. I read that the iPhone cube chargers are 5 watt, 1 amp just like the Kindle. I have the iPhone chargers all over my house. However, the cable that charges the Kindle is somewhat unique in that it is USB to \\"Micro\\" USB, and the cable shown here is what is needed to connect USB to the Kindle. So, rather than buy a Kindle charger AND cable, I bought just the cable for a lot less cost. I think the Kindle charger and cable are about $30, and this cable was about $7. So, my Kindle is back in business for about 1/3 the cost. The iPhone charger and this cable work perfectly to charge the Kindle. The wattage and amperage of the iPhone and Kindle charger are exactly the same. I'm pleased with this cable and the cost savings! It works perfectly!
B00HJ957BC|5|Seriously what's NOT to like about this movie?? I need a 3D TV... It's just as good when you watch it upside down too...
1400069289|5|Loved it. Kept my interest. Charles Duhigg did incredible research for this book. It pulls you in from the beginning.
1594202842|3|I love how Amy Chua just takes one extreme view point to stir up controversy.  For me, I think the answer to being a good parent means not being one extreme or the other (tiger mom vs attachment parent).  Amy Chua's husband grew up with what sounds like more laid back, free-spirited parents and he still ended up in the same place, at Yale!
B00JB3MVCW|5|great movie
B0074D3CAQ|5|I highly recommend this book for a great summer read. An unlikely pilgrimage indeed, but a journey into the soul of a man most would never expect anything remarkable from, a simple, lonely, unheard man. From his early  years, Harold tries to fade into the background, to go unnoticed. As he matures, he chooses a career that is safe and doesn't require him to excel. His relationship with Queenie is a mystery  until later in the book.  His relationship with his wife, his son and people in general are all disappointments in his life. His journey reveals a side of him, people he meets and his family even he could never expect.
030789701X|5|This was a great purchase, I thought the postage was excessive but when the book arrived it is huge and must weight a couple of Kg's.  The book was posted on time and arrived 11 days later (to Oz), so fast :).  This guide is the best, it has everything you need to play Skyrim and all the add on's.  I am very, very happy with this purchase  which arrived in pristine condition, no scratches or corners bent Thank you :)
B001NLKSI4|4|To be really honest I hated Jordan in this book.  I wanted him to get a huge punishiment.  I know he has to pay a grip of cash, but I wanted his life destroyed, like the old man who he robbed in the begining of the book.  The story was well written and I couldn't put it down, mostly because I wanted him destroyed.  But I know since it was written from a personal stand point that he really wouldn't be.  But damn I was hoping.  As autobiographical books go, it kept me reading, even if it was presumptuous as heck.  It is a good warning to the egosentric of our world, you will eventually get caught.  If you loved the movie you will love the book.  He goes into way more detail than the movie.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Fascinating slice of fiction in WW2 setting.  Entertaining as well as informative
B001706I5I|5|Love this movie
B000QFCD5O|5|A great reassemble of the original lineup. All is well and the release of new material is anxiously awaited. John Wettons vocals still has that awesome power he is famed for. I look to hear the new songs that match the range he has now.
B007SGLZP8|3|Not the stellar books we've come to expect.  I've read all of Grisham's books and have liked all of them. This was a disappointment.
B0000025GW|5|I dont care what those other folks say bout old dylan how he left for christianity , dont give me that...there just mad casue they dont believe in it and there \\"leader\\" now is into it so they make fun of him? thats sad but all in all this cd is awesome , nice relaxing scene it gives to sit back and listen to and sing to , this is a really good cd all put together and needs more credit but I guess it wont sence he left his \\"old beliefs\\" but everyone has stayed with him over all the years so just listen to the music...
B00542USJW|5|We were very happy how quickly we received space jam and it was a good price! Glad we could find it on here since we couldn't in stores.

B00BC5I6Q2|4|If you liked &#34;West Wing&#34; you'll enjoy this! Kevin Spacey is excellent, and the scenery around Washington, DC is beautiful.
B009R659L8|5|As always Mary Higgins Clark has written a spellbinding story. Just when you think you've solved the mystery she introduces evidence that changes how you see it.
B008B1BL4E|5|I felt that this History was a real insight into the origins of WW I. The historical thread(s) were extremely  complex and I really felt that I was wandering in the weeds during some chapters. That being said, this History is well written and the author does wrap up his conclusions clearly. This book is must reading for those interested in exploring the origin of a calamitous event which shaped the 20th century.<br />RAJ
0439023521|5|Great writing
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great purchase and fast delivery
030758836X|2|I'll admit, I'm not the most gracious, forgiving audience.  This is really a split personality review because most of the book is 4 stars and the ending is 0... so I met in the middle.  I don't have a lot of free time and I want my books to be compelling top to bottom.  When I started this novel, I was floored!  The author had such fun with language.  The story was intriguing.  And then the second act was such a terrific 180... I was hooked.  Maybe that's why I felt so betrayed when everything started going south with the story.<br /><br />The third act sounds like it was written by another author... someone who was mimicking the style of the first author, but lacked the grace.  The twists and turns that kept the story fascinating early on became utterly ludicrous.  And there was no one left to root for, where early on I vacillated between heroes, which was great fun. It felt like the author wanted to do a \\"gotcha\\" with the audience.  Oh, you think there's going to be some redemption.... well, you're wrong!  I didn't feel like the story ended so much as it stopped.  I was reading on a kindle so it looked like I was only at 95% when the story ended (due to the closing promos) and I think I sat there with this dumbfounded look on my face for a solid 3 minutes.  And then I pathetically kept flipping back and forth like... WHA HAPPENED?!?!<br /><br />Honestly, the first two-thirds of the book are such fun and so skillfully written, I'd say you should read it if you don't care about books ending badly.  However, I had to go with 2 stars because if someone had told me the last third was going to fall apart like that, I personally would not want to invest myself.
B0087HT36U|4|this game was fun and frustrating at the same time. some levels were easier than others but over all a very enjoyable game.
B00JH49OTS|1|Stopped watching after ten minutes.....
B001ACY8D2|5|Well, you either love these guys or you don't.    I happen to love them, and I'm all over myself with this CD.    No, this isn't \\"Taak\\" or \\"()\\", but there's much to love and fall in love with this one.    Just listen to it, and enjoy!
1405916400|1|...at 25% and what was a series I loved, has become one I have lost complete interest in.<br /><br />It's been 18 months since book 3. I can't bloody remember what happened and I haven't the time or inclination to do a re-read. I can't finish it. I'm bored and am finding doing anything but reading this much more amusing.<br /><br />The biggest mistake possible was made in taking this beyond a trilogy. The magic that was Gideon and Eva has left the building and quantity (also cynically known is $'s) has clearly favoured quality.
B0055D3EFU|4|This movie starts out fairly mundane. Kid, family, new home. I couldn't help but think that this was going to be another Poltergeist or Paranormal activity. I half expected to have a jump scare within the first few minutes. Nope, didn't happen.<br /><br />However, the opening was more about you identifying with the characters and getting to know them better. I was really rather bored about 15-20 minutes into it. There's quite a bit of foreshadowing in the beginning, however.<br /><br />Then things start getting creepy. Typical poltergeist happenings, followed by several other scaries and a whole lot of creepy. Some awkward long dialogue scenes later in the movie with extreme close-ups on the actors faces really killed the mood. Still, the creepy factor really added up and startled everyone who was watching it with me, including myself. A for effort.
B004J4WLB4|5|Unusual love story between a daughter, mother, lover, sister and how their storie intertwine.  Beautifully written, kept me reading into the wee hours.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|I love Jelly Splash, however there are levels that need more moves to complete than what is allowed.  I have been trying to complete level 50 for 2 weeks.  I am not a facebook user and I can not complete it.  I wish that I could skip this level.
B000JPRPAO|5|I watched the movie several times and still want to watch more. It is a fantastic thriller and action movie. I liked the story and how the planned it.
B003Z49LYO|4|This is very good, need more seasons!  Very nice scenery.
B001IBIQU6|4|Well... Depeche Mode has better albums like Ultra or Songs of Faith and Devotion. This album is great and the sounds, despite being sometimes electronic dark, is a very good option to all Depeche Mode Fans
B00IX9UTLU|5|I found this to be a page turner with a lot of emotion.  I'm anxiously awaiting book four, &#34;Hudson&#34;.  The author really developed the characters to draw you into their backgrounds, experiences, and reasons for their motives for their individual behaviors and actions.  I couldn't read this fast enough!
B001ACH4DS|3|This CD is NEITHER the masterpiece 5-star effort that most are labeling it, nor the 1-star crap that others are.  David Cook has an amazing voice, and while I no longer watch AI, when I heard him for the first time, I thought that finally America got it right.  This CD is really a sandwich of songs, with no meat in the middle.  The first 3 tracks get things off to a great start, and the last 3 tracks close it out nicely.  The problem is the 7 songs in the middle are very generic and unmemorable.  My recommendation is to save some money and download 1-3 and 10-13 and leave the rest.  If you are \\"digitally impaired\\", the six good songs make it worth picking up a used copy.
B0013WJGJ0|5|Ever dance with the devil by the pale moon light?
B00F8F3J2S|5|Not sure how this country gets anything done with politics and personalities involved.  This book was very informative but saddens me with the turmoil in governing.  Courageous and more.
B007TNQ7EY|5|i have been looking for a good free roam gta style game and i came across thisgame and i am a cheapskate butspent the money for thisgame and i am glad i did. this game  feels soo much like gta san andreas i couldnt believe it. i wasnt expecting much out ofa tablet game but this one is the shizzle if you are even thinking of getting this game, DO IT! this game is great.
B00W6XM002|5|Addictive, lost somewhere in the 300's.
B001UV4XJ2|1|Ok, when I originally ordered this the description just said \\"Digital Copy\\" which has always equated to iTunes compatible and more importantly a true copy you could download to a device and take with you wherever you went, like say an airplane.  No, no, no...UltraViolet is Ultra annoying and impractical.  Honestly, you can use it on your mobile phone but only if you are connected to WiFi...if I were at home I would watch on my TV.   This is nothing but a deceptive business practice being used by WB to try and lock in people to a service that doesn't really work.  These people jsut don't get their consumers and more importantly don't care!    Horribly disappointed with this purchase...if I had know they would drop the ball on this when I originally ordered I would have just purchased via iTunes.  Save the couple bucks and just buy the standard 3D version if you want the discs.
B003XF1XOQ|5|definiety a easy read. Something to get your mind off of your daily routine. I dont want the story to end.
B009V5KI98|4|How can you not like it!  Its a fantastic classic, even with the slightly racist overtones in some of the characters.  I was slightly shocked to not have remembered that there were a few choice words I would have preferred my six year old not overhear, but then again, there are worse movies to which he would be exposed.  The songs are still wonderful and aside from not fitting in to the politically correct mold movies currently are, the movie still transcends time well.
B0013TXA5Y|3|After hearing a few of my [adult] friends go on and on about how good the series was (and with the arrival of the movie) I decided to finally breakdown and read City of Bones.  I should have stuck to my guns and left it alone.  It would have saved me about 12 hours of reading.  The book itself was an easy read and SHOULD have been right up my ally as far as supernatural/paranormal/sci-fi genres go.  However, I was sorely disappointed.  I knew most of the storyline before hand and I'm NOT a huge fan of predictable books.  I'm extremely tired of the 'love triangle' scenario that most YA authors seem to think is necessary for a good story. Not to mention that this book reads almost identical to the first installment of 'The Infernal Devices' series from this author as well (yes, I know that the names are different and the heroines have different abilities, but beyond that they really are the same story and just as predictable).  I will not be suffering through the entire series, the inside covers provide me enough information to figure out how the story ends.  I'm sure to most teens/young adults this is a very intriguing book series, but it's just not for me.  And because I initially enjoyed the Twilight series I assumed I would find this a good read, but alas the story doesn't really focus on the budding love story or being a Shadowhunter in depth.  The characters aren't real enough, in my opinion, and therefore makes the story itself rather dull.  I gave it three stars simply because the idea and concept of the Shadowhunters interests me, but other than that it was all kind of... meh.
B0098VXN2Y|4|Fun movie
B00ESY77LO|3|Impressive cinematography but too busy, cameras moved so fast switching from one angle to the next,  wish the story line was longer .
B007IXWKUK|5|Rated.5<br />Like how two messed up people with many differences can find each other. Wow! Great love story. Thoroughly enjoyed
B00006IRJU|4|I searched for this album after I lost my original one while moving house. I was pleased to find a good quality secondhand item on Amazon. The album itself is a good recording of Icehouse at their very best and it stands as a signature album for them. It is light 80's pop music and just about every track is a good one. This is one of the few albums in my music collection that I will listen to all the way through.<br />Item condition and quality was exactly as advertised and was shipped and delivered VERY promptly. Excellent service all-round!!!
B00009NQQO|2|Gets moldy really fast. My son loved but I had to throw away after 6 weeks. Not worth price.
B0027ZCQ4E|3|just as described
B0058VW36U|5|This was fun for me for awhile then got a bit tedious, however it gets five stars because it seems like it can keep the niece and nephew occupied indefinitely.  The content is all very age appropriate, and with some element of reasoning and experimentation needed to successfully complete the puzzles, it doesn't seem as detrimental, maybe even encourages some spatial reasoning, so letting the kids play with this &#34;indefinitely&#34; isn't as irresponsible as it might seem at first.

B004ZLBTK0|5|This sophomore effort from Adele is rich in lyrics, production, heart, soul and voice.  The extra live tracks at the end put the cherry on top.
B00KMX5V8G|2|Of the 50 coins I started with, I now have just 19 left AND NOT ONE SINGLE TIME DID I INTENTIONALLY MAKE A PURCHASE.  The way they position pop-up and buttons (or lack thereof) means accidentally spending coins - there is no confirmation screen, just oops hit the screen in the wrong place or at the wrong time and too bad coins are gone. Clearly this is not an honorable company, I'll keep my dollars to myself thank you. Really sad that such an otherwise incredibly fabulous game is being ruined by such incredibly excessive greed.  Stupid really, stepping on their own feet.

B00SH04286|4|Provocative story and Johansson character. Great action of female hero.
B00AEQYM6S|5|You need to like Wagner, (and you probably wouldn't be reading this if you didn't) and you need to be curious about a singer who is getting so much praise.  That's me.  Wagner is hard work.  Especially for tenors.  Not many have the equipment to sing his music.  This man has the equipment.  Powerful one moment, lyrical the next, soaring and ecstatic or subdued and reflective, he is totally believable, always just right.  He also seems to have good sense about what he will sing and what he will not.  May his career go on forever.

0525457585|5|I'd have to admit - I've had never read the book until a few weeks ago and brought the book from a used bookstore. However, I did saw the movie during the mid-1980s and it always been a part of my childhood memories because I have always loved it. It wasn't until a friend's recommendation that I should read the book and I found myself reading it with such an awe. There is a saying of the modern times: \\"The book is better than the movie.\\"<br /><br />So, I finally got a chance to read this book by Ende, and I have to say, it's such an fascinating novel. I can most certainly tell the major differences between the book itself and the movie version(s).<br /><br />There are basically two journeys as portrayed in the novel: Bastian's reading Atreyu's journey by reading a book and Bastian's own journey inside the said book. There are a lot of themes in this book that can be grasped by adults, so this book is not just for children (though, it meant to bring out the child in ourselves).<br /><br />I have found it interesting to see Atreyu's journey as really about bringing Bastian into the story. It appears to be a sort of a sense of dissociation - escaping into the story (or meeting of two selves) - and then Bastian became completely involved in the story and saved the Fantastica by giving the Childlike Empress a name, which starts a new cycle of life in Fantastica. When Bastian became involved in the story, he was wearing the AURYN (medallion) that would grant him many wishes but down the road, it became clear that more wishes he wanted, the more memories he loses. And, he would lose his \\"Self\\" or his sense of identity. Atreyu and Falkor are the ones who see the problem with Bastian's continuous wishing. The more Bastian engaged in his own wishful thinking, the less \\"real\\" he becomes. And, Atreyu has led a rebellion to go against Bastian and take the medallion away from him. In the end, Bastian lost all senses of who he was but with Atreyu's help, he was able to \\"go back home.\\"<br /><br />It appears to me that Bastian and Atreyu are different aspects of each other (since they saw each other in the Magic Mirror). Atreyu never stray from his goal and knew the dangers while Bastian was continuing to wishful think, wanting to be an \\"Emperor,\\" and his wishes led to his downfall. Bastian's actions were surely selfish and in the world where his wishes were become so true and real to him.<br /><br />All in all, it's an fascinating story (and regretted that I didn't read it earlier) and this novel challenges one's imagination as regards to the fantasy world. When we are drawn to living in fantasies, we can always return to reality with fresh new eyes and new energies as simulated by these fantasies, such as fairy tales (with deep meanings to them, unlike the modern \\"stories\\"/films that achieved nothing more than entertainment).<br /><br />With much ecstatic, I would surely recommend this book to anyone, both children and adults.me.\\"<br /><br />It appears to me that Bastian and Atreyu are different aspects of each other (since they saw each other in the Magic Mirror).

B0082Z1CVQ|5|Enjoyed reading it, there is so much wisdom in it. Sad that is finished. Everybody should read it. Thank you. Amazon!
B007SGM084|5|Loved this book. In a deep depression now im finished.
B00CWY76CC|5|Brings back nostalgia for the days of the Crimson room and the other escape room games, it manages to pose a bit of a challenge without seeming too impossible.  Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys these kind of games
0345535421|3|I loved \\"A Game of Thrones\\" so the moment I finished it I ran out and bought \\"A Clash of Kings.\\" It was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />As I wandered through the novel's 800 or so pages, I found my focus drifting. Too much repetition, too many words for too little action. Honestly, I think you could boil this book down to about half the word count, and it would be for the better.<br /><br />Then I came up with the perfect reading technique: just skip the chapters I'm not interested in! That is how I got through \\"A Clash of Kings\\": by jumping from character to character, following their story, and then going back for the characters I cared less about.
B00LOMNHXU|4|it's like those find the object<br />but finding a card...more challenging<br /><br />good for free game of the day(how I got it)<br /><br />not worth buying the game(I would by do it)
B0014U4X3U|5|Jane Austen...The words speak for themselves but it was really fun to read her works front to back without stopping!!!!!
B009LDCZ7I|5|It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time, great!!!!! Really nice show to enjoy at home
B00IS87HYI|5|Great game.  My seven year old enjoys playing it along side my husband.
B00FAPF5U0|5|At first I thought that this was just another match three game. I find them boring. But the created ways that this game is put together I find it very challenging. I just wish I could get the other sagas on my Kindle. I would really appreciate it.
B00005QGAZ|5|Great item
B00KFG156C|5|This is an awesome book!  I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline and getting to know Mare.  It was fun, interesting and had some good twists.  The only bad thing is that the next book doesn't come out until next year and that's way too long. :)
B009UX2YAC|4|This is the best game ever. I say it is only 2nd to temple run only because of the amount of coins you get at a certain time. In temple run you get multiple coins that are really close together. In subway surfers you have coins spread out pretty far until you can get a good long run in, otherwise this game is the best
B000957O7S|5|This is a guy-flick that chicks will adore.  The dialogue is compelling.  We rarely \\"buy\\" a film but this one is a must-have.  The Date Doctor's advice is worth heeding, too.  Refreshingly creative--Will Smith outdoes himself.  For all ages!
B000MRAAJM|5|This is a must have video collection item to explore through mother nature beauty.Excellent video to watch with family or for kids.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I have spread the word to my frail friends...this is a Wonderful story.  The characters were very real and the author may become one of my new favorites.  Loved reading this book.
B001F7MSFM|5|great
B005GFPZYK|4|Well written but very emotionally difficult to continue to read as life got worse and worse for the main character. The ending did make it worth reading however.  I only read it because a friend told me I should read it before seeing the movie. Not sure I can watch the movie after reading the book, especially because I've been told that the movie ignores the redemption that follows the torture.
B00EZ50SGW|1|I enjoyed the first film quite a bit, but thought this sequel was abysmal. The humor doesn't work at all in it and the scares are as generic as can be. James Wan can do better than this!
B005SZNZAY|5|One of the most powerful voices in rock goes acoustic, plus Cornell tells little stories between songs. A++
B003MYYJD0|4|I Like the watch. is looks good and serve me well so far.
B000ANVQ0K|5|Every once in a while the conversation will turn to \\"favorite movies.\\" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it. <br /> <br />I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic. <br /> <br />No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully. <br /> <br />James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed. <br /> <br />This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, \\"flying\\". \\"Iceberg, right ahead!\\" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears. <br /> <br />The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many. <br /> <br />I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. <br /> <br />Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.
B00BUCXVPI|4|What we were expecting entertaining action packed my husband and I enjoyed .
B00AG6Z92C|5|Loves his music.
B00CMQX84A|5|Not a huge fan of the new Disney movies they seem to really talk down to kids. But that being said my daughter loves this movie and had her whole birthday party a Teen Beach Movie theme. The girls loved singing along and coming dressed as bikers and surfers.
B009UX2YAC|5|I love subway surf!! it is so fun and very addicting!! I cold not stop playing it!! you will love it, too!!!
B0052UZIFA|4|Love this app... Very addictive. Want an update with new challenges. Love the achievements, my husband and I had a race to seen who completed them first. Now my 5 year old niece is teaching her grandma how to play. Great fun!
B004JZBGWI|2|I like this app but when it prompts you to update and then erases all your notes in the process that is a serious mistake and stupid behavior for an app like this, pretty annoying
B00LXLM05I|5|Was amazing and cool
B00BKU9ZFU|5|Cecile's interpretation of music choices provides the listener with purity of delivery in the jazz tradition.<br />A must experience for new listeners!  She has an emerging future among the &#34;greats.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5|I thought it would be easier to buy a larger amount of coins or gold bars. This has resulted a major loss of money. It is never credited. The crying faces continue to appear even after it has gone through all the motions of a purchase. In the last two days over. $40 has gone out of my account  into cyberspace. This repeatedly happens. Contacting the companies has resulted in saying it will take 3-7 days to straighten out. I have never seen that happen. This game is designed so that you cannot win without boosters. I give up! Delete!
B005VPRDAY|5|Bought these for 2 of my grand daughters and they loved them.  Just having the pink set for girls was a big hit!
B005J9ZDYK|5|Nice to have them all on one DVD...great stuff.  We now own every Shaun The Sheep episode ever made.  Love it!
B00DYTKKGI|2|I downloaded this when my niece was coming to play so she would have something to do. She couldn't really do anything without me buying the game/add-ons to the game.
B008XX6J4C|5|Piano guys are the most talented group coming down the pike.  Cannot wait t see them in person.  Will travel far to do so
B00GRHVIGU|4|I loved the song &#34;Radio&#34;. The words are mesmerizing to me. Another beautiful song was called What's Broken. DC is in good voice, I liked the background guitar as well.,
B0032Y0OH0|5|You just don't know how much you'll appreciate a jog shuttle for editing until you get one, and I finally broke down and bought this relatively inexpensive unit.  Works like a champ with the included software under Windows 8 and Sony Movie Studio.
B004ZJZPXY|4|If you like Pegg then you will like this. No doubt about it any way or the other. Wash and enjoy!
B002BSHWUU|5|these REMASTERING type of things are sometimes all hype but i do believe that these cds are a big improvement over the 1987 versions,listen to them side by side with the originals there is a big difference in the sound quality anybody with half an ear can hear that,listen to a song like I WANT YOU(shes so heavy)from ABBEY ROAD is riddled with distortion and horrid clarity issues the new version is pure and clear.YESTERDAY from HELP! has never sounded better.i think some sound better than others,i dont notice a great difference in SGT PEPPER but  ABBEY ROAD, REVOLVER, THE WHITE ALBUM,and the earlier cds that have been mixed in to stereo are a night and day difference than the 87 cds.give your ears a real treat and listen to the GOLDEN SLUMBERS/CARRY THAT WEIGHT/THE END medley its breath taking at some points.hey if your happy with your cds from the 80s keep em.but for real music fans buy the remasters its truly a worth while experience.
1423101464|5|I can't rate this because the book was for my grandson's birthday and I have no idea what it is about.  I'm certain he will be very happy with the book since he has already read book 1 & 2.
B003O86FMW|5|I could not put this book down! I read this series a few years before the movies came out. Loved this series but book 2 is my favorite!
B0036BK6MW|5|Awesome my mom loved it
B00DR0PDNE|1|OMG.  I was advised to buy this item to stream to Amazon Prime to my HD tv.  It is absolutely the worst internet &#34;casting&#34; product I've ever used.  The video stream was awful: choppy, out of sync, froze continually...essentially unwatchable. For the same money you're much better off with a simple HDMI adapter from Apple. Chrome will NOT solve the issue of casting/syncing Amazon Prime. Not to mention that it doesn't work with your Apple devices (iPad, iPhone.)
B0064X7FVE|4|I had this app through the Google playstore. The latest version there is awful. This is one time I am glad Amazon is behind on updates. I recommend not updating unless they fix the scroll they added, remove the ads, and add back M - points.
0345544927|4|Always a good read
B0049J0DC8|4|A lot of &#34;shut up&#34; and &#34;idiot&#34;, which made it a little older than our audience here at home (4 1/2). But otherwise, it's an all-time classic for all to enjoy.
B007SGLZP8|5|All you need to say is it is another John Grisham blockbuster.  A great read you will not want to put down.
B00CKJ2KK2|4|It is good but u need to be able to fly the airplanes then it will be 5 stars but till then 4 stars it is
B004GJDQT8|5|Amazon always has the best prices and works to ensure complete satisfaction. I would recommend them to my friends and family for sure!
B007PT3QOQ|5|love this game.  great job.  like it almost as much as the original Oregon trail game.  keep up the good work!
B006QKKN14|4|I have thoroughly enjoyed watching all of the Final Destination Tails.  I believe this one is my favorite, up until this movie came out my favorite was the first movie.
B000I5X81K|3|The voice is still great! I have been trying to find just one song that makes me want to hear it over and over again.  I have not found it even though I played it several times.  Right now, I am not even sure where the CD is.
B000GDH9JQ|3|Worth it for the dancing but not much else.
B007BRJYF2|4|it took 10 min to downlode. I have a great time finding everything it is a awesome game the graphics are good its a good finding things game. but it is really for pationet people ^.^
0805095152|5|I had been expecting a book about decisions near the end of life, and while this area is well covered this book is more comprehensive than just that. Dr. Gawande covers the whole terrain  starting from dependence as we lose our capacity for independent living and look towards assisted living or nursing homes. These are choices that can last for years of life, and the book explores how we got to our present system and where it can be improved as well as examples of improvements already offered in some places. Fully half or more of the book addresses these topics, which may or may not be what you are looking for.    The book turns to address the choices and decisions that need to be made when mortality is not somewhere in the indefinite future but has an identifiable cause and a more limited horizon.  Dr. Gawande discusses the older paternalistic approach of medicine, the more consumer-like \\"just here to give information\\" approach now in vogue, and an approach he advocates in which doctor and patient together explore fears and concerns, what goals are most important, and what tradeoffs one is willing to make. Amply illustrated by real-world examples, including the final illness of his own father, this book is one that lets one think about how to approach a time that will come for all of us.
B000I9VZJ8|5|I watch this with my young kids, it's a movie that doesn't have cuss words and teaches them to be themselves. Still a great flick!
B0006FO9J2|5|This is by far the best Iron Maiden archive and documentary of their early days. What was so strange is that I just saw here in Amazon that it was going to be released on December 28th, but here in Mxico it's been already out. Anyway, for you american people, I tell you it will be worth the wait...
1476778388|5|I was incredibly surprised. This was actually literary fiction. And I loved every story.
B00MJJ37BE|5|No Surprise.....perfect!
B00BIVN82M|5|Love anything Michael Buble does. If you enjoy listening to him, you'll love this collection of songs. Three more words.
B000003CKH|5|This album changed the way I thought about music.  A few Cake albums later, I'm still absolutely in love.  The ironic lyrics and compelling use of horn keep me coming back all the time.  John McCrea's wit is obvious in every song.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Wonderful I didn't want to put the book down. I read the entire series less than one whole week. Love it.
B00E9P959O|5|With Vapor Trails now being over 10 years old, it has had enough time to blend into the context of the entire Rush catalog.  I feel the same about the album today as I did back in 2002.  It ranks among my favorites.  At that time, I applauded Rush for creating a hard rock album relevant to the times.  It was rock with modern sound and mix approach.  It had edge and emotion.  The lyrics were less pointed and more open to interpretation.  I never minded that the individual instrument and vocal tracks were in my face, because I believed that the band wanted it this way.  It was their comeback album.  Neil had been through rough times, but the guys finally committed to a project.  The intent of the whole package shouted that Rush was back, and I loved it that way.<br /><br />To further my point on the intentionality of the original mix, check-out their live album \\"Rush in Rio\\" which was recorded on their tour supporting VT.  The sound on that CD comes at you with a heavy punch--even the crowd noise is turned-up in the mix.  I love the way they recorded this concert.  Next to All the World's a Stage, RIR is my favorite live Rush album.<br /><br />One Little Victory brings more inspiration to me than probably any other Rush song.  Ghost Rider has a similar emotional vibe.  Rush is a thinking man's band, but this album is wrought with emotion like no other Rush.<br /><br />I'm a bit of an audiophile, so I have good equipment.  I appreciate sound quality and all kinds of music.  I decided that Rush was mixing Vapor Trails the way a lot of new rock engineers do, with all the tracks pushed up front.<br /><br />All that said, the new remixes are outstanding.  The wider dynamic range enables the listener to pick-out all the instruments better and hear detail never heard before (for example, listen for the subtle backdrop of static now in Secret Touch).  New pieces and parts have been added and some parts have been replaced.  If you turn it up a little, it'll still hit you likea ton of bricks.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll listen to the new mix exclusively now but treasure the memory of first appreciating the Vapor Trails jam session back in 2002.  No doubt my favorite Rush album since Moving Pictures.
B00929G8SS|3|This review is for the import UK version release of Manowar \\"The Lord Of Steel\\". This version is not available through American Amazon  site. You need to buy this version on United Kingdom Amazon site. Manowar \\"The Lord Of Steel\\" is a good cd but has some flaws. The cd recording quality is not the greatest. The bass seems to be louder than the vocals and all other instruments. And the cd does not play as loud as their two previous releases. The \\"Thunder In The Sky\\" ep and \\"Battle Hymns 2011\\" cd plays louder than \\"The Lord Of Steel\\" cd when played at a same volume for comparison. The cd is good but the recording is a disappointment. Especially when Manowar likes to claim they are the loudest metal band in the world but their new cd does not play so loud.
B0018YIW4S|5|The added tracks are a bonus. I was irritated at first that they opened the album instead of being tacked on to the end, but they fit right in and help build that anticipation. I seriously need to buy better speakers. I don't think I can play this loud enough so that my neighbors can enjoy it as well.<br /><br />This is my favorite version of Doctor, Doctor; I'm a Loser, Mother Mary and Love to Love.<br /><br />If you are looking for something for some one who likes music, this is what I would recommend. it might just save the world.
B0058EBNAO|5|Do not let the price turn you away! Once you figure out how to use the app (its not that difficult) it is very detailed and very informational. I love this app and really love the radar. This app is definitely worth it!
B00FEMJF6O|5|This game is really fun and easy to use. I like how it is like the Facebook game but has some differences

1451627289|4|If you could go back in time and change history to make the world a better place would you. Stephen King tackles that theme in 11/22/63, taking us on Jake Epping's journey as he travels back in time as George Amberson from 2011 to stop the Kennedy assassination in 1963. We already know that King is one of the best modern horror writers, with this book he becomes one of the best modern fiction writers as well.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of time travel fiction. It's easy for an author to make mistakes. Time travel can be tricky and often ends up being messy prose. King improves this type of storytelling by adding themes, choices, and consequences to his story. He does use the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" trope creating ripples throughout time and improves on this by making time fight back, the past in 11/22/63 does not want to be changed. King's prose is easy to read contributing to a great story.<br /><br />Kings characters mesh making them believable. Their interconnections work great, especially when King contrasts Jake's failed marriage with Christy in 2011 with his love for Sadie in the 1960s. The friendships King writes for Jake with Al, Deke, and Ellie, also juxtapose themselves with reality creating a greater story and bringing depth.<br /><br />One problem I do have with this book is the set up. King spends so much time describing the events from 1958 to 1963 that when he finally shows us what happened in the future it feels passé. I would have loved to have gone deeper into the changes after the assassination was stopped, delving further into the history of how the world changed rather than have just a couple of pages. Sure, we get hints and glimpses of what has happened since 63, and Jake mulls over the choices that he has made. For me as a reader, it just was not enough.<br /><br />One of the unique passages within the book comes from the town of Derry where King brings us back to one of his older stories, \\"It\\". Not once but twice does King go back to the Maine townas he describes the Pennywise murders, Jake encounters Richie as well as Bev all the while he is trying to save a family that haunts him in his future. Using Derry grounds the story for Stephen King fans and allows them to know the world that he creates. It also allows King to build on the themes from Derry, such as Jake's feeling that something is not right in the town, and transpose them onto the city of Dallas as well. Derry provides a mystique to the book, allowing King to flow the mystery of time fighting back throughout the novel.<br /><br />This book is Stephen King at his best, but it is still not his best book. For me that has to go to It. I still walk around looking down sewer grates scared that I will see Pennywise staring up at me ever since I read that novel in my teens. With 11/22/63, King proves that he is not just a genre writer, this is one of the best pieces of time historical fiction that I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to any historical fiction or Stephen King fan.
B00HT944D4|5|I love the Mary Poppins movie, having watched it many times, with my nieces when it first came out and then with my own children years later. I looked forward to seeing Saving Mr. Banks when it was first announced, and wasn't disappointed. It's such an endearing story-so glad that Walt Disney was able to persuade the author to agree to the movie and all the fantastic songs!
B004EPYZP8|5|great movie needed to own it  so i can watch repeatedly  waiting for next one out  please  soon please  thanks
0385534639|5|I finished reading \\"The Night Circus\\" last week, and am so happy I came across it. It's a beautifully told story of magic and love, filled with an unusual cast of characters and settings. This story is deeply and darkly emotional, one I truly felt. Thank you, Erin Morgenstern, for bringing the Night Circus to life. I'd visit it in a heartbeat!  I highly recommend that you read this book, but only if you want to be swept away into a colorful and fascinating world!
B00APN454E|5|Classic movie
B00IMYZOBQ|3|I rented this because of all the great things I heard about it and the awards on it.  It was a good movie but I think it was over-hyped.  I certainly enjoyed it and the effects were great but there was nothing that took my breath away (I&#34;m a hard sell).  It was easy to order/pay/download my first amazon movie though!  Very easy to rent and watch!
B00JOT3HQ2|4|I love this game it's so addicting!!!
B000ZNRBK4|3|You get exactly what you pay for. This is a mediocre lens hood. It's just what I needed. It is not as sturdy as I would like but it is what I expected.
B0098VYCCE|5|I never commented any movie before, but wanted to support this one.<br />Really enjoyed watching with my teenage kids.<br />Thank you.
B008602KQI|4|Really enjoyed this adaptation of the book. Jennifer Lawrence and the other actors truly make you care about Katniss and Peeta as they try and win the Hunger Games.  It is an entertaining and enjoyable story of good triumphing over evil.
B001V9LPWQ|5|The classic Snow White looks better than ever on this BluRay DVD. It's obvious that Disney spent a lot of time and money turning this classic into a high-def film. But they did not re-do any artwork. It has the look and feel of the original, just sharper than I've ever seen it.<br /><br />This package is an excellent value as it comes with 3 DVDs: Two BluRay (one with the video and the other with extras) and one standard DVD. I really appreciate it when they add the standard DVD so I'm not tied to a high-def player. I can throw the original in an old DVD player or a computer, and even the standard DVD looks better than ever.<br /><br />Disney would have been justified (and probably would have sold plenty) at a standard BluRay DVD price, but as of the time of this posting, pricing was much lower than most new release BluRay discs, plus they threw in the bonus disc and the standard DVD.<br /><br />If this is any indication of how Disney will roll out all of their classic cartoons into High Def, I'm excited.
B007XKEY6Q|3|i have many games going and cant figure out a way to cancel or exit games with people. I would like to delete some games and people, please advise.
B004J4WKTW|5|a little bit difficult to follow the location and timeline jumping at first but beautifully written so that each time you re-read it you get the delight and satisfaction of understanding or picking up on something that you didn't catch or notice the previous times you've read it - absolute magic!
B0015DROBO|5|Excellent story, tons of twists and turns, tension building throughout, and maybe the most uniquely drawn character I've read in some time.  Lisbeth is never someone truly likable, but is never dull to read about.
B005IQZB14|5|A great read for all. A fun, touching, and emotionally satisfying adventure.
0380977281|5|If you have ever pulled your tattered copies of C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles from their space on the shelf as an adult, you will definately enjoy this book.  Not as innocent as Narnia, Stardust nevertheless conjures  delightful tale of a young man's journey through Faery to lay claim to a  fallen star.  Interesting characters abound in this tale-- drawing the  reader deeper into the twilight world of Faery as their tales are woven  into the rich fabric of the world beyond Wall.
B000JQU4TW|5|Love this story! A true horror classic!
B001UV4XIS|5|This movie sets the Harry Potter Sega to all time HIGH!! Voldemort takes over Hogwarts and no one is safe. Harry and Voldemort finally goes head to head in the greatest battle ever and Professor Snape shocks everyone in this movie because he tells Harry exactly how he feels about him.

1451695195|5|All of us are weak at one time or another.  I am a strong Christian and believe God comes to all of us as we need to see Him.  Eben Alexander MD was not even looking for God, but God found him.  I give this book, 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real to those who have suffered loss, whether &#34;Faithful&#34; or not.  Weakness finds us all.  We  need His help to get through until we meet them again.  This book is another source of &#34;Help&#34; from God.  We are all doubting Thomas's and we all have weakness and questioning God when we have great loss.  Rest assured, He is our Rock and Salvation - and doubt is Satan's way of keeping us in the &#34;Loss Column&#34;.  Eben Alexander is a messenger for His purposes and I am thankful he has seen the Light!

006178480X|5|This is his latest in the Sigma series.  This is a thriller and the adventure the characters undertake is a ride.  I love that he always explains the science of the novel or the history used, at the end.  I recommend his books all the time.
B004I8WD6E|5|Case came in right on time. It is just as described and Fits snug on my iphone. It protects the phone from any drops and the front of the screen is protected since it comes up and over the edges of the screen. Would recommend!
B004DLPXAO|5|If you don't have a kindle this is an easy way to read the books. its easy and quick to use not difficult at all!
B005UG53NS|5|Exhilerating
B000A6T1JU|4|This version had some extra scenes and commentary but i would have preferred the old version without the comic book rendering of a new scene.  Still it was a good movie; you either get it or you don't.  It was interesting to see New York and Coney Island the way it looked back then.
B00EMJD6TC|4|I had heard all kinds of negative feedback. This movie was a lot of fun. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.
B0064MPXFA|3|Loved the first season. The second she isn't nearly the strong woman I saw the first. Hoping that changes
B007IXWL2C|5|This trilogy was exceptional! I couldn't out it down! All I'm praying for is another addition! I hope there  is more!
B00499NHLC|5|Absolutely loving this show. Cumberbatch and Martin are excellent. Best Sherlock Holmes to come around in a long time. Thanks!

1440503257|4|I bought this book for the recipes, but love it most for the explanations of all things British.  When I read the Harry Potter books I used my imagination to try and picture the food J.K. Rowling was describing.  This book clears up the mystery of what exactly foods such as treacle, pasties, and bangers are.  The author also explains the origins of the food in a fun way.
B00846REIS|5|I read this in a day and a half!! This is such a great book. I'm starting the next one right now! If you liked 50 shades of grey then you are going to love this!
B00B2V66VS|5|It is an epic game where a giant gorilla chases the heck out of you. It is much more intense, interesting, and there is a lot more twists and turns than temple run 1. I recommend this app mostly because it is free and fun for all ages. Plus, it has upgrades and different characters that you can buy AND there is much more upgrades than temple Run 1. Let's just get too the point, IT IS EPIC. It is one of the best games I have. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001D0BLTA|5|Superlative!!!The movie accurately captures the high school insecurity angst of the popular rich kids.  Movement between the cliques is still based on the feudual lord (James Spader) approval.  High School social hierarchy is still based on medieval feudalism.  Great directing and acting is represented by the longevity of the principal actors in the fickle Hollywood business.  Writing is fresh and comical with catchy phrases.  May I admire you.  I am forever you duck man.  Classic.  Musical score is great with OMD and New Ordr. I would have added Boys Don't Cry by The Cure.
B000I5YCCO|5|I saw Taylor live a couple of weeks ago and fell in love with her music.  She sounded great, was gorgeous, and had personality to boot.  Bought the CD this morning and it's awesome.  I only wish the song \\"Permanent Marker\\" was on it...maybe next album.
B008J34466|5|Greatest CD
030789701X|5|This Tome is complete with recorded knowledge from previous adventurers of Skyrim. If you are a veteran of Skyrim, but still want to find mysteries to be unraveled, this tome might just offer what you are looking for.<br /><br />Comes complete with a cartographer's map of Skyrim with all the locations that are noted. The Radiant Raiment was honored to give this masterful tome a touch of style with a silk-woven bookmark, straight from the finest suppliers in Tamriel. This book also has dossiers and profiles on some notable folk from the Skyrim holds, which may prove useful for the new adventurers who wish to seek a advantage in gaining quick honor.<br /><br />If not for the usage, definitely for the collector. The Mage's College in Winterhold has a great library which features the very original print of this fine tome. It is closely guarded though, because it is imbued with strange magic that is said to connect mundus to a different universe. Strange mysterious dialect with words like &#34;car&#34; and &#34;gun&#34; or &#34;Airplane&#34; are found in the imbued magic.<br /><br />You have been warned, if you open this book, you may feel a strange connection with some unknown void.<br /><br />-Alexanjor, Nord Scholar.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Easy. catchy read.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is fun for the whole family. This is a great way to bond with order children. Definitely recommend for anyone
B0018AK9RA|5|I think all Judas Priest is incredible. With Nostradamus, they have created a Masterpiece!  Rob Halford's vocals just get better all the time, and the guitar playing is superior. It proves what a great band Judas Priest really is.  The Metal Gods are mature, and show their true confidence in this album. The range of their career has bloomed with the coming of Nostradamus.  They are to be forever remembered as the Metal Gods!
B00DDPZIUG|5|I really enjoyed this addition to the series after struggling to get into it at the start. I found the first few chapters somewhat distracting but the effort was worth it. Looking forward to the next one.
B005NGKLX2|5|What a great movie.  I love movies that take their time with character development and showing us the elemental differences between the characters.  Also the cinematography was wonderful and wondrous.  I've never been to South America, so I can only assume they used Bolivia and Chile for that, but in any case it's as beautiful as Costner did with the American west in \\"Dances With Wolves\\".  Shepard is incredible as always as is Stephen Rea and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau did an impressive job as the younger Butch.  I highly recommend it.  It's a movie for those of us who think.
B009EHDU7U|5|An engagingly funny book which also takes us on ride through history as we follow the life of Allan and some of the interesting characters he meets along the way.  I enjoyed the author's portrayal of this man as one who, despite his 100 years, still had enthusiasm for, and an interest in, living.  Any wonder he wanted out of the Old Folks Home!
B00P596I8Y|3|I was laughing at the pop up book part.
B006ZCWTV0|5|Polls tell us 51% of Americans believe the bailout of the banks was wrong. An overwhelming majority --- 86% --- disapproves of big bonuses on Wall Street. And more than 50% feel that \\"the power and influence of banks and other financial institutions represent a major threat to the country.\\"<br /><br />You'd think that a lot of bands would have a song for those people.<br /><br />It's no great mystery what messages that music might deliver.<br /><br />A shout of rage for what vulture capitalists have done to workers and the dispossessed.<br /><br />A raised fist at the politicos and pundits who know exactly how the game is fixed and don't give a damn because they've got theirs.<br /><br />And a message of hope to all those who are struggling to pay their bills.<br /><br />The silence of other musicians -- well, finger-pointing no longer matters, for we now have that CD. It is fierce and blunt and angry, and unapologetic about its rage; in the Guardian's phrase, it's \\"a sledgehammer holding a megaphone.\\"<br /><br />And the guy who made it is 62.<br /><br />In Bruce Springsteen' s world, the plane leaves when he shows up. He's got acreage that a Texan might envy. His kid rides expensive horses. As he once wrote, \\"I've got the fortunes of heaven in diamonds and gold / I got all the bonds, baby, that the bank could hold.\\" If he were so inclined, he could go on a Greatest Hits tour until the end of time and end up far north of a billion dollars.<br /><br />But then he would not be Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />If you've listened to Springsteen over the decades or even just dropped in on his seminal CDs, you know that one bright thread in his career is his concern for workers, the poor, the lost and the broken. It starts with \\"Born to Run\\" (1975). On one level, this record is a wet kiss to the American dream of endless youth and a four-lane highway with no speed limit. On another, it's a rebel yell, the defiant statement of a kid who's not going to let his soul be crushed.<br /><br />That kid grows up fast. \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" released just three years later, describes what it's like to discover you're not going to realize the dreams of your youth. The new challenge: to find dignity in defeat, to get married and have kids and still maintain some respectable definition of manhood in a system that reduces you to a cog.<br /><br />Jump-cut to \\"The Rising,\\" the 9/11 record that begged someone to make it. Not my favorite Springsteen, but it brought comfort to many, and that isn't small.<br /><br />And now \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" If we were to talk about the music here, I might say this is Springsteen's most interesting CD in a long time; you'll find jaunty Celtic melodies and gospel and rap and references to Pete Seeger and Johnny Cash. But the politics overshadows the music. As someone has said, this is the soundtrack of \\"Occupy New Jersey.\\" [<br /><br />What are the politics of \\"Wrecking Ball?\\" Simple: Springsteen hates the way people who have gained the world have lost all sense of connection to the rest of the planet. And now we --- he's in the 1%, but he identifies with the 99% --- are jobless and ignored. \\"The country we hold in our hearts is waiting,\\" Springsteen said during the 2004 election; eight years later, we are \\"shackled and drawn.\\"<br /><br />Some critics have dived into the politics of \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" and boy, that conversation can get granular fast. I admire their erudition, but I really don't think the politics is the main event here. Emotion is.<br /><br />By emotion, I mean primal feeling, what's revealed when everything you think you've got is stripped away. You can't really channel this; you need to have lived it. And Springsteen has. He's spoken of his father, \\"emasculated\\" when he lost his job in the `70s: \\"Unemployment is a really devastating thing. I know the damage it does to families. Growing up in that house, there were things you couldn't say. It was a minefield. My mother was the breadwinner. She wassteadfast and relentless and I took that from her.\\"<br /><br />In this CD, the wrecking ball that took down the old Giants Stadium becomes every dirty deal --- and every lost job:<br /><br />Now when all this steel and these stories, they drift away to rust<br />And all our youth and beauty, it's been given to the dust<br />And your game has been decided, and you're burning the down the clock<br />And all our little victories and glories have turned into parking lots<br />When your best hopes and desires are scattered to the wind<br />And hard times come, hard times go,<br />Yeah, just to come again...<br /><br />What do you do when you can't win? Just stand your ground. \\"Take your best shot,\\" he taunts the wrecking crew. And to us: \\"Hold tight to your anger/ And don't fall to your fears.\\"<br /><br />And this isn't the stance in just one song. The CD is shot through with a fierce refusal to sugarcoat bitter knowledge. Start with \\"We Take Care Of Our Own,\\" the song he did at the Grammys; only the brain dead could miss the irony.<br /><br />Then move on to \\"Rocky Ground,\\" which features this bit of rap (yes, rap):<br /><br />You use your muscle and your mind and you pray your best<br />That your best is good enough, the Lord will do the rest<br />You raise your children and you teach 'them to walk straight and sure<br />You pray that hard times, hard times, come no more<br />You try to sleep, you toss and turn, the bottom's dropping out<br />Where you once had faith now there's only doubt<br /><br />Samuel Johnson, 250 years ago, noted, \\"The natural flights of the human mind are not from pleasure to pleasure, but from hope to hope.\\" But as I hear it, the question at the heart of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is: How can we go on when the game is rigged --- and there's no hope? That is, first, a commercial question. No one wants to listen to a 45-minute dirge --- you gotta give them something that doesn't make them want to slit their wrists. But beyond commerce, that is the emotional question that \\"Wrecking Ball\\" must address if it's to be any kind of help to us.<br /><br />And Springsteen does directly address it in what I see as the key song of the CD, \\"Land of Hope and Dreams.\\" It's not a new song; it's been a high point of his concerts for years. And deserves to be --- it's an invitation to salvation, and for everyone. Show biz theatrics? I think not. I think this is the moment when it all comes together, and the world drops away and the reason you're the one standing up there is revealed. It's a moment that chills and inspires, and it doesn't happen often enough.<br /><br />\\"Faith will be rewarded,\\" Springsteen sings in \\"Land of Hope and Dreams.\\" \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is the argument against that. And yet, against all evidence, this is what Springsteen affirms. Because although he's a fallen-away Catholic, he believes --- as I find myself believing --- that there is something bigger than we are. And that, just maybe, we'll be okay.<br /><br />A CD for the ages? Maybe not. But later, when we look back, I suspect this will be the CD that will remind us what it was like in the late winter of 2012.steadfast and relentless and I took that from her.\\"<br /><br />In this CD, the wrecking ball that took down the old Giants Stadium becomes every dirty deal --- and every lost job:<br /><br />Now when all this steel and these stories, they drift away to rust<br />And all our youth and beauty, it's been given to the dust<br />And your game has been decided, and you're burning the down the clock<br />And all our little victories and glories have turned into parking lots<br />When your best hopes and desires are scattered to the wind<br />And hard times come, hard times go,<br />Yeah, just to come again...<br /><br />What do you do when you can't win?

B00G5G7K7O|5|I grew up with Lion King, Aladdin, Little Mermaid... one of the best times in Disney movie history.  This one brings back the magic in a big way and I cannot seem to get enough of it!
0553381695|4|Warning, possible spoilers if you haven't read Game of Thrones.    A Clash of Kings is a follow-up to Game of Thrones and the second book in the series A Song of Fire and Ice.  In it George R. R. Martin continues the tale of the struggles for the throne of Westeros and all the chaos that accompanies it.  While GoT had very little magic or sorcery in it that starts to change in this book.  At the end of GoT dragons have been reborn in to the realm and it seems they might be the controlling force concerning magic as after their birth the users of magic have discovered their powers increasing.  Add in the fact that the realm of the Seven Kingdoms is falling apart as everyone uses the death of King Robert to either make a grab for power or to settle old scores in the resulting chaos and it ain't safe out there.  Robert left a young son to inherit but it's been discovered, or at least insinuated that the heir is not really the heir, that he is a bastard born of incest between the queen and her brother.  This leads Robert's eldest brother, Stannis, to declare himself king, supported by Robert's most loyal follower, Ned Stark.  Unfortunately Stannis is stuck on his own island stronghold while the heir, supported by his mother's family, holds the capital.  Not everyone is buying the incest tale and so view Stannis as a traitor.  This leads to the capture and death of Ned Stark.  In the meantime Stannis' younger brother makes a bid for the throne himself figuring Stannis isn't well liked giving him an opportunity.  Up in the north Ned's eldest son has been fighting House Lannister, the heir's supporters, because they were behind an attempt on his brother's life and the death of his father.  Somewhere along the line his supporters say to hell with the kingdom that is and declare him King of the North, a title dating back centuries to a time before one of his forefathers bent the knee and joined the united kingdom rather than continue a war with it.  Also in the north Balon Greyjoy, who once lead an uprising against the dead king, Robert Baratheon, has declared himself King of the Iron Islands and has moved against Robb Stark's holdings in the north while he is occupied further south against the Lannisters.  To round out the potential contenders for a throne, across the sea, Daenarys Targarayan, last survivor of the dynasty that Robert unseated, has found a way to revive the dragons her family used in conquering Westeros in the first place and is making plans to retake the throne she considers rightfully hers.  On top of all the human turmoil a threat deemed vacant for thousands of years is rising in the North of the continent, beyond the great wall built to contain it.  In addition to the supernatural threat itself the denizens of that territory are gathering, looking to invade the southlands in order to flee the threat.    Got all that.  Good, because that is just the major lineup going in to A Clash of Kings.  Underneath all that are all the lesser lords jousting for position, supporting whichever claimant they feel is going to allow them to get what the want whether it has to do with ambition, greed, revenge, love or any other human motivation.  That's what Martin is writing here and what he is damned good at, human motivation.  Unlike most fantasies Song of Fire and Ice is not a battle of good vs. evil just because almost no one is totally one or the other here.  They're all human with all the foibles that entails and all the baggage that goes with it.  Some are loyal to a cause but most have a personal ax to grind.  Even those whose motivation isn't viewed as evil may perform wrongful actions because they are too unyielding in their own personal code, seeing things in black and white with no shades of grey.  All in all in makes for an epic tale of struggles, between the characters and within themselves.  If you make it through this book better plan on buying the supposed 5 books to follow, and hope that the last 2 make it to marketand we aren't left hanging, as the tale is gripping, probably more so than any other fantasy epic I've read and that includes LotR.  How Mr. Martin can keep track of all the twists and turns he is taking us through and even more pressing, can he keep it up, are a couple of questions you will be asking yourself.  Again the book is written from the viewpoint of some of the major players, some dropping out as they are killed and others taking their place.  Oh yes, Mr. Martin is not shy about shedding blood and not just that of sideline players, anyone is fair game for the ax, or sword, in this story.  Considering the all the betrayals, killings and characters that are involved in this story it seems that bringing everything to a satisfactory close by the end of the series, satisfactory meaning there aren't any loose ends not that the guys you are rooting for win out, but I plan to stick with it to the end and feel you should to.  If you enjoyed GoT I think you will find Clash of Kings just as good if not better and fitting second volume to the story.

B00000DGUG|4|Alanis Morissette was good on Jagged Little Pill, but after purchasing Infatuation Junkie, I was surprised at all the songs I didn't like.  But after about three weeks of owning it, I like all the songs, and I like her  sudden calmness on &quot;Heart of the House&quot;. Then her sinnging on  &quot;Baba&quot; was very religious, speaking of gurus and students and  all.  Another song I particularly liked was &quot;Front Row&quot; which  was intriguing, but didn't have the religious attitude that the others had.     &quot;So Pure&quot; was another one, where she sings that &quot;so  pure&quot; is such an expression.  &quot;Unsent,&quot; the track before  &quot;So Pure&quot; is fascinating.  I begin to wonder &quot;who were  Matthew, Johnathan, Terrance, Marcus and Lou?  Were they real?&quot;   But overall, I really liked it, except for &quot;Are You Still Mad?&quot;  which amde me a little uncomfortable about what she might be going through  in her mind.  I hope she Keeps it up!

B00CS65JS2|5|Daft Punk set out to make an homage to the dance music they grew up with, a sound that seems to come from somewhere near Los Angeles in the late 70s or early 80s if a couple of androids had roamed the scene way back when. If you want to know all you need to know about this album, then know that there's a big controversy in music circles because people are saying this is music \\"for their dads\\" and that they'd be embarrased to listen to anything this old-sounding (read: oldschool).<br /><br />...which hilariously ignores the fact that virtually all modern dance music is based very directly on work straight out of a continuum of dance music from the 60s to the 80s, with whole genres built around samples like remixed drumbeats from talents that backed up James Brown or synthesizers that originally accompanied Donna Summer. I hate to be that old man shaking his fist at the kids on his lawn, but this is the time for it.<br /><br />Daft Punk have made a glorious album that brings back every last bit of soul and funk and \\"GIT DOWN\\" from a bygone era. This music makes me want to rent an eye-damaging color of convertible and drive it down to the beach for a twilight dance party. This music makes me want to move, to groove, and above all to smile. Daft Punk had made a name for themselves for making low-production wonders (Homework, Human After All) and they take that to the extreme on this album, using a heavy dose of live performance from real musicians with a decidedly minimal use of electronics. It's an odd situation when having the guitarist from Chic lighting up your tracks is \\"low production\\"- and the results are all the better for it.<br /><br />There is one honest fault with the album, in that it's missing any strong female presence. Considering the massive influence women had over this era, this seems like a glaring omission. A modern music critic should also note that a lot of current dance hall tracks seriously overuse female vocals, such that when you browse most popular lists of dance tracks you're guaranteed to find syrupy-sweet female lyrics just about everywhere, and the lyrics serve absolutely no point in the actual music (when the original women of dance music were often making major social and political points, particularly in the areas of female and community empowerment). Maybe Daft Punk were making their own statement regarding this problem with modern music in their anti-use of female vocals, as they're clearly making similar points with the rest of this album regarding other excesses in current music. But the album still feels incomplete, point or not.<br /><br />This album is easily a \\"top album of the decade\\". Although what decade that is, might be up for debate. If it had included a proper female presence, Random Access Memories would be a contender for \\"THE top album of the decade\\". Really enjoyable, this is going to be a staple of my listening for a long time to come.opular lists of dance tracks you're guaranteed to find syrupy-sweet female lyrics just about everywhere, and the lyrics serve absolutely no point in the actual music (when the original women of dance music were often making major social and political points, particularly in the areas of female and community empowerment).

B002NXSRVG|1|The acting is bad, the writing is bad, and I was wish with all the destruction in the movie the entire cast of characters would blow each other apart. The special effects contradict themselves by being really good and really bad. The acting on the other hand is constant in it's blandness. Skip this movie, and if you watch it and love it, don't tell anyone so they don't think you're 5.    You know there's a sequel coming so hey \\"Hollywood people\\", please fire the director and the rest of the cast and get some real talent in there.

Scout now a woman out on her own living in New York comes home for a visit.  Here she encounters Atticus & dozens of familiar faces & lives, all of them trying to deal with time, life and the Supreme Court decision on civil rights.  When reading GO SET A WATCHMAN, try to remember the atmosphere of the South after the courts decision.  Maycomb is no different and Scout is thrust into the middle of it.  She still sees Maycomb and Atticus and the residents as she did when she was younger when she ran the streets with Jem & Dill playing and getting into trouble.  That's her first mistake.  Like I said before, dont criticize it before you read it.  I was crying towards the end.  Its not TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD & it never will be, but I think as a first book of Harper Lee's it was a good read.
B001ECDVKE|5|Normally, I don't get excited about alien invasion films. Mars Attacks is a different story. This is Tim Burton at his finest. His genius pays homage to all of the great sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's while having fun with all the special effects mainstream film money can buy. The cast is fantastic. Some people have said that there are too many \\"stars\\" for one film - but if you look at the films of the 60's and 70's (especially Robert Altman films) that's all part of the magic. The cast has as much fun as the audience and everyone goes home happy. Enjoy this film! It's meant to be fun!!
B005S9EK5Y|1|Great movie...I saw it previous to purchasing this DVD.  Fo not purchase from this seller. I watched the movie with company for the first the last night. Skipped and stopped. However, I am unable to return because it is over a month from purchase. Watch the movie, but find a different seller!
B005RUUUAI|5|if she could she would always watch this show the program is clear and she enjoys it very much. .
B00VRYCGLO|4|Love it
B00003CXBK|5|Simply the best animated film ever.  Not like regular Disney in that adults will enjoy this as much or more than children!
B0094BB4TW|3|A bit to simplified for Facebook. You do not see as much information as you do when you log in strait from the internet.
B000063DI8|5|No Prayer for the Dying is a really good addition to any Maiden fans collection,It contains the opening blistering \\"Tailgunner\\" which is one of my all time fav Maiden songs.As well as great rockers like \\"Holy Smoke\\".I know some dont like this album but you should check it out and make your own decisions.
B002VWNIAY|4|I bought this as a gift for my dad for Father's Day and he loves it! He says it's his favorite move!
B0000A4GAK|5|I have been hooked on Derek Trucks' music for over three years, and this release proves that my obsession is not unwarranted.  The musicianship of the artists playing on this cd is unparalleled in today's musical arena.  This cd is almost all instrumental, with the exception of one track with singer Gregg Allman, whose soulful, Southern crooning delivers the chills.  The instrumentals range from the bluesy beginning of Soul Serenade&gt;Rastaman Chant, to the jazz infused Bock to Bock.  However, the most captivative track on this wonderful cd is the last one, an original instrumental titled &quot;Sierra Leone&quot;.  This is what Spring would sound like if it was transformed into music.  Perfectly beautiful.
B00BD6EJRK|5|Excelent
B006FE83UE|5|I can't say enough about Harper Lee's thrilling sorry. I wish everyone would read this.
0930289234|4|Fascist: a reactionary or dictatorial person.<br /><br />Watchmen is well written, to make a gross understatement. It is a gritty, complete world that uses the fantastic so sparingly as to create a truly immersive story. The characters are seriously flawed, just like all of humanity, and make some very very bad choices, especially in the end.<br /><br />Using logic that dictates that the ends justify the means the characters choose who lives and who dies in order to \\"save the planet\\" from the ruin of war and intolerance. The protagonists in this story are kept secret, even until the end. You are allowed to make up your own mind about who is the most right or wrong. Nobody in this story is pure... except for the god-man. And he eventually decides the fate of the world.<br /><br />And here is where the writer, Alan Moore, shows his cards. By creating a character who \\"sees the big picture\\"; who \\"is above the pettiness of human beings\\" who can't make the tough decisions, Moore has set the stage for an inevitable conclusion: some people, alot of people, an enormous number, will have to die to save the rest of us. It doesn't matter who it is, just so long as it is a bunch of them. Them. Not us. Not me. Them.<br /><br />As storytelling goes, it is nearly without flaw. Watchmen is a seminal work in the vein of HP Lovecraft's very best. Many works will take the lead on this book for one simple reason: it is a fantasy lovefest for those who want self-righteous justice.<br /><br />But, if you're not looking at it that deeply, it is also a great escape into a sweeping mystery novel that ties up every loose string in the end.
B00CEZJT2E|4|The edge is not slik, a little disappointed.<br />Everything else is fine.<br />Take a really long time to charge to full, don't know is it normal.<br />But first 1/4 charging is very fast.<br />Slim as advertise.
B00D2JDNQ4|1|It was such a long winded read, although the story line was good, it just took a lot of unnecessary vocabulary to get there.
B00AREIAI8|4|Its a really fun game but it keeps not loading every other time i load it. But super fun!!! It also has amazing graphics
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is a good game.  I haven't had any problems so far.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I only read when I have to. But his book just caught my attention, started and finished in one day. Be mentally prepared for chapter 21.

B0064X7FVE|4|really good app I tried all other weather apps for my fire this one is nice.... all the updates are instant.....
B009NFHF0Q|5|Written as a memoir, the is narrated by a man returning to a farmhouse down the street from his childhood home. It follows two timelines; the frame story of the man skipping out on a funeral and his fuzzy recollections of a magical time. It's a quick read and Gaiman's usual &#34;adult themes&#34; aren't really present, other than a brief passage through the unfocused lens of a prepubescent boy.<br /><br />I read it in less than a day while on vacation in Scotland. Definitely worth it.
B000053GTK|5|This album is simply all that prog-rock is about but still it hasnt got one cliche on it. This is truly PROGRESSIVE, not just rock songs spiced with occasional 7/8-parts. Just get it. If you love progressive rock, you love Gentle Giant.
B007BVOEPI|2|It was well made, no doubt about that, but the bottom line is it was just to gruesome, dark, gritty, depressing for me. I would probably like it if everyone wasn't getting raped or killed or raping or killing 24/7. Pretty interesting story, I just wished I could have read the CLIFF NOTES without having to witness the constant gritty details.
B006ID6NDQ|4|This is an intimate look into of one Austrian Jewish woman's survival during WW II. The many details and descriptions leave the reader feeling as if they've glimpsed some of the darkest moments in history along side of the author.
B008SAZHLQ|4|I loved how well Rowell captured first love and the awkwardness of it. The end left me hanging and I wanted it to be more. I felt like it was rushed and forced.

B00LV4PZ3G|3|Cool game
1101946342|1|I'm using this space to express gratitude to amazon for a generous return policy. Unbelievably bad writing. The &#34;insights&#34; into Christian simply justify the acceptance of abusing women as his right, even more so than the poorly written drivel of fifty shades.  Sad to think women want this treatment, sadder that we're so entertained by such atrocious writing.
B007WULJ5G|4|This is the most intense movie ever made!  It's worth the price just to see if you can make it all the way through to the end.  I had to pause it a couple of times just to wrap my head around what I just saw (and once to nearly throw up).  Some of the biggest taboos of society are not just broken, but shattered in this film.<br /><br />I deducted 1 star because it is not up to Hollywood production values.  But the images are clear & the sound is crisp.  Don't let the subtitles scare you away.  In the same vein as &#34;2 Girls 1 Cup,&#34; you have to challenge yourself to see if you can handle it!
B0088W6IMQ|5|I love it just because it is Stargate.
B00MXBIPQK|5|Thomas Bergersen's music could be compared to novels, each song takes you to another place and tells you its own beautiful story. The music is powerful and demanding of attention.
B00BKZUVGM|5|These books became my life for a little while. The story line is amazing, feeling like I was there with all the characters. Literally cried because they finished...

B00D7Z4GQY|5|Once I finally got immersed in this book, I couldn't put it down. It will take a while for me to stop thinking about it. The way the paths of the characters lives unknowingly intertwined makes one ponder the hidden course of their own.
B00FM8WGK2|5|my daughter loved it as it was not availible in sa and she noe has 40 in her collection of monster high dolls
B001FB563E|5|I wont go into details so not to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Though dark this is a great story of a father & son's struggles and their fight to survive. I hope the world never comes to this, can you imagine? Great acting by Viggo. Highly recommended, though not for kids.
0307408868|5|Loved it
0486464504|5|I actually purchased this edition and another later edition. Both are valuable and easy to locate your grammar subjects of interest. I have one at home and another at work. I'm in the process or writing a book; that I hope to sell here on Amazon.  The name of my forth coming novel:  THE ROCK OF NEREID.<br /><br />Vincent J. Arcuri
B008JGSM6G|5|We downloaded it free from the Amazon Appstore and love it - we may even spring to purchase the full version.
B00594XOZU|1|I can't get no smileys. I can't even upgrade it to new colors
B0094BB4TW|4|What can anyone say about FB. it is Social media for your portable device. It will sync across all of your devices and give you the same information when you are on the go
B006ZS4SXQ|5|This collection of wanting a product<br />Regret working fine<br />I hope I have put a light brick<br />Quality is excellent value for money
B008JGSM6G|4|A bit easy, but fun.
B007J4T2G8|5|The book was highly touted by several intelligent women that I know. So I opted to read Fifty Shades of Gray, Vol. 1....WOW! What a STOREY TELLER.  She introduces an idea or thought through one of her characters in one of the chapters, and then brings it to light in another. Just blows me away away! WHAT a future she has launched. I have started Vol 11 and I am excited Because Now we're getting into the heart of the Storey. Happy reading
B00000DQSS|5|Perhaps the last gasp of the gorgeous British pop in the vein of the Beatles' Abby Road (where it was recorded), but stamped with her own very personal style.  Contains the minor worldwide hit Babushka. The album is  dark (the cover and the content) but very sweet.  Contains her first  experiments with the Fairlight sampler, and incredibly fun bass by John  Giblin on several songs.
B0000027D5|2|... as one might think, considering that this album was, a few years ago listed in an Entertainment Weekly article as one of the hundred best albums of all time--and rated fairly high within that one hundred, as I recall. I bought the album a few years ago on the strength of that.<br />I was initially rather disappointed. The versions of Santana's most popular numbers Black Magic Woman and Oye Como Va are rather perfunctory, and much of the rest of the album is devoted to lengthy jazz fusion tracks.<br />Recently, having purchased a car with a CD player, I have resurrected a number of neglected CDs including this set. It has not improved. While there are some excellent numbers with inspired playing there are a number of negatives that count against this album and in my opinion exclude it from any all time great list.<br />1. Poor recording quality. While live albums, for example BB King at the Regal sometimes provide a fine example of a musician in tune with an audience, this is not one of them, and it is replete with squealing feedback and poorly engineered instrumental balance.<br />2. Way too long, with far too many long noodling solos that go nowhere. Although there is some fine playing by Santana on lead guitar, there is also a fair amount of showoff trickery and repetition that adds nothing to the music. There is also one track of over nine minutes that is nothing but a percussion solo. Samba Pa Ti, which is an exquisitely pretty tune is largely thrown away, Black Magic Woman is cursory, and so on. Some of the later tracks on the second album, though overblown, provide some good driving music, with occasional whimsical quotations from pop tunes.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Me and my friends always play against each other and it is really great love this game
B00GRPD0J0|5|it was free and could be put on my kindle, but i don't know if I will really use it as I do most off my mail-reading on a computer!
B0007Z4S4C|5|For those of you who have been and always will be a Robert Plant fan, this is the CD for you to play everyday. The vocals and arrangements are excellent. On Tin Pan Valley you get to hear that awesome Plant Wail. I'll make it simple this a completely fantastic CD, Robert still totally has it.
B003YK42LQ|5|good sounds
B008JGSM6G|5|This game is a great mind bender. Fun to play and it works your mental and spacial thinking abilities. Great
B000005HN6|5|No words can descibe this....    My first Opeth purchace was \\"My Arms....\\", and as much as I hate to say it, I wasn't all that impressed. I then read some reviews of the Death Metal super group Bloodbath, and decided to buy that. It totally blew me away. That is one of the best Death Metal releases I've ever heard....    After being so impressed with that, I decided to give Opeth another shot. I then purchaced \\"Still Life\\". This was the Opeth I was expecting from the start, and that's a very impressive release.....    After hearing \\"Still Life\\", and liking it, I wanted to expand my Opeth collection. I then proceeded to read reviews, and after hearing such good things about \\"Orchid\\", I bought it as well. I waited a long time for this to come, and once it did, I popped it in immediately.....    IMO, \\"Orchid\\" is the best Opeth release I've heard yet. This is just so beautiful, I can't really descibe how wonderful it is. It's got an incredible melodic feel, along with some of the best songs I've ever heard. The musicianship is flawless, and these guys are truly in a class of their own.     \\"Orchid\\" was the Opeth I was looking for from the start, and I'm now proud to say that I'm hooked on Opeth, and everything they put their name on. These guys are the best Death Metal band in the world right now IMO. Nobody can touch the pure brilliance this band produces......    \\"Orchid\\" really hit me hard, and this is one of the most beautiful Death Metal releases I've ever heard. This is easily worth five stars. If you can pick this up, I highly, very highly recommend you buy it as soon as possible....
B000056K04|1|This cd is nothing like the others. I am disgusted that Dave would just sell out like this and totally change his image and music.  I just hope he never releases something like this ever again.
B00L4LUGEY|5|This movie was really good. It has some very strong relationship messages and some pretty good music, as well. Relatively family friendly.
B003UYUP58|5|Probably tells the lay reader more than he can assimilate; however, still valuable in explaining the complexities of the disease and the dedication and tenacity of researchers in unlocking these complexities.
B0089EHWQE|4|loved this book...cried my heart out...will read more of Moyes  books after reading this one
B007J4T2G8|5|I am stunned by all the reviews that are less than 4 stars.  This is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.  It's more than a sex book. It is a terrific love story betweeen two people who are total opposites that bring out the best in each other.<br /><br />It's a must read.  If you are on the fence about reading it because of some of the bad reviews, don't be.  I, too, wasn't going to read it and I am so happy I did.  I am actually going to reread the whole series again.  I can't get enough of Christian and Ana!
B008NMT684|5|My Grandson loves this puzzle and he especially loves the to pop the balloons at the end of the puzzle. Now if only I could get my Kindle back from him!
B000VZJUGY|4|What exactly do I say about this album that hasn't already been said? It's dark, angry, full of deep lyrics that alternate from soft, almost whispered, singing to screaming that would drive a person with lesser vocal strength than Trent's to their knees. It's a syringe of dark emotion that gets injected directly into your ears and leaves you wanting more, but it also suffers from the fact that there is nothing else to parse out once you get the lyrics. There is no deeper narrative to unravel, just a whole lot of raging, screaming, and pleading for help.
6305079900|5|'The Terminator' is a timely reminder that, once upon a time, Arnold Schwarzenegger was *way cool*, and that James Cameron was also similarly respected ('Aliens' is still the definitive Cameron film, though). Cast to  perfection, Schwarzenegger dominates the film to such a degree that the  hero, Michael Bhen, is totally overwhelmed. It's a very 1984 film - the  action is extremely violent, the music is done with synths, and the bad guy  carries an Uzi (the 'trendy movie bad guy firearm' for much of the 80's),  but it hasn't dated too badly, as it's clear set in 1984 and works as a  period piece.<br />It's a model of how to make an action film, and how  sometimes a bigger budget and more time can make a film worse. Initially,  it sets up a complex, engaging plot in a few scenes. It then develops the  plot with the minimum of fuss, moving swiftly through a mid-section that  doesn't really pause for breath, before a striking climax and a neat,  thoughtful ending. Not a scene is wasted, and not a penny is spent  unwisely.<br />Working on a tiny, 5 million dollar budget, Cameron keeps the  effects short and sweet, and with minimal publicity and no real stars, the  film must have been an unexpected surprised for the people of  1984.<br />Schwarzenegger's salary for Terminator 2 was twice the entire  budget of this film, despite which the sequel is inferior - bigger, more  impressive to look at, but slower and clunkier, and with a horribly dull  bit in the middle that a younger Cameron would have erased.<br />All in all  this is a classic piece of US cinema, and should be in your collection.
B0034DGPEU|4|This gripping story is set in a shameful time of America's history.  Although the main characters were well-defined and and the story engrossing there were so many additional characters that it was sometimes challenging to keep track. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a truthful, yet disturbing, account of life as it had been and one woman's journey to survive.
0399159347|5|this story is told from more than one woman's perspective. it involves several women all linked together by their pasts in a Sydney Australia neighborhood. things are set off by the most organized and successful of these women, Cecilia, finding in her attic a letter from husband instructing her to read it upon his death.  her husband is alive but on a business trip. the contents of this letter will show how interconnected all of these families' lives are including Tess, who moves back from Melbourne when she splits from her husband, and Rachel, whose daughter was murdered when Tess and Celia were just girls themselves. all of these women have families and those families are the most important parts of their lives. each of them will be facing what matters need to be spoken about and which are best left alone.  their consciences are all sorely tested. this book manages to make mundane things like a tupperware party and an easter hat parade be engaging parts of the book.  this author has three other novels, all of which i intend to read.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007V9YF5E|1|I've watched for maybe 30 minutes and the background music never stops for more than 30 seconds. It's unrelenting. It interferes with dialog. It's stupid and a deal-breaker. I'm done with this piece of crap.
B005VTS4EY|5|This app is super fun. Not too hard that you quit and not too easy that it is boring. Sometimes you need creativity sometimes just good timing. Beat all 100 levels and very sad it is over!! Get this app!
B004FRX0MY|1|If you are getting this as an alternative to spotify, get spotify the layout is better and less confusing
B00C6BA4SE|5|The movie looks great on Blu ray. So good that I decided to get the Steelbook version and give this to a friend.
B000V4NX04|5|One of the best films I have ever seen. First viewing was theatre several years ago; I watch it again once a year or so to remind me how lives are torn apart by selfish interest and social injustice, pertaining to current times as well.
B007FG9LIE|5|I first heard of this book after seeing the tv show pilot on Fox.  Immediately I realized I needed to read the book.  Two days after getting pines, I'm done and finding myself craving the second book.  You could say I'm addicted!
B00A3Z384M|4|Always have liked Michael Keaton as Batman.
B00338QENI|5|What a way to be remembered.  I couldn't put this book down because the topic of DNA is so current and I did not know this story and my emotions ran the gamut from intensely sad (for the plight of the Lacks family) to very happy to know this research is being done.  I do think the family should have been compensated for the commercial aspect of selling Henrietta's cells.

B00003CXN4|2|When I watched this it reminded me what I thought of The Assassin (Bridget Fonda). In that case an absolute classic movie Nikita was destroyed with a mind numbing version for the US audience. It's happened again here with Traffik becoming remade as Traffic. Traffic won all the awards and took all the money buy you owe it to yourself to watch Traffik, the original.
B0029LCJJS|5|The series, The Tudors, is fantastic.  I watched it almost all night.
B0001CNRSE|1|The only possible reason to watch this sorry movie would be for the advertised dancing, except the dancing was TERRIBLE. watch You Got Served or RIZE for great dancing. (they both had equally terrible acting, scripts, characters)Jessica Alba is not cute enough to redeem this mess. Also, it obvious she's trying too hard to talk and act urban, not very becoming)
B00000099Y|5|Amazon has a large selection on music.  I found all the cd's and they were all in stock, Rock on!
B004P8JPS6|5|If you like a drama/thriller with lots of twists & turns,you'll LOVE this book!  Also has lots of humor and very good writing.  You have to stop reading in the middle of the chapter, because when you get to the end, you can't wait to see what's going to happen next!!

Glad I got this, does everything the marathon does, is just as durable, very good looking, and I saved 400 bucks.

B00JVZ0DQG|2|The newest update has the game running so slow, it makes it frustrating and almost impossible to play! Please fix ASAP!!!!!!!!#!!
B00005JLSE|5|This is such a great movie!  Even if you're not a fan of musicals, you have to see it.  The comedic value alone is enough reason to see it.
B000KIPT30|5|I love this thing. It's only 20 bucks and it serves a great purpose. I've had some problems with Behringer stuff in the past so I was a little worried, but this Headphone amp works really great for me.
B00N6PD3GE|5|A great read.
B000002H97|3|Imagine Winston Churchill doing used-car ads; that's what this album did for Metallica.  <br />It cheapened the legacy of a super-band.  I can't worship this golden statue of metal-dom after its feet of clay have been exposed.
1936608898|5|I followed the plan to the letter. Today is the day \\"after\\" I completed the 30 day period and I stayed on the plan today because I just feel so good. It make a remarkable difference in my energy, mood, and reduction in swelling. Remarkable. The old \\"me\\" feels like a distant slug of a memory compared to this \\"new\\" me. After day 5 my cravings were significantly reduced and it made the rest of the time on the plan much easier. Only after sticking with it for the whole 30 and not cheating at all can you know the effects sugar and grains had on your body functions. Get it, read it cover to cover, and do it wholeheartedly for the whole30.
B00CO8D3G4|3|i came across this book when i'm thinking of choosing myself- quitting my jobs and pursuing my dream. I did not find this book very informative. If the author can organise the content well , i think it's easier for the readers. And some of the points are like beating around the bush...Anyway, i have found the daily practises to be very useful..<br /><br />Instead i found this book to be very useful and practical. And i'm no longer in dilemma, i have gained clarity and know my purpose and choose to be myself.. I would recommend this book to you [[ASIN:B00E3BISFQ How to Supercharge Your Willpower 10X Longer than Everyone else - Even if you have a history of Procrastination, Perfectionism and Self-Doubt (The Start-up Entrepreneur Edition)]].<br /><br />I hope you can benefit from this book too. Let's talk
B000002NHN|5|I had never heard of Lorrena McKinnett.  I had heard Mummers' Dance on the radio maybe once.  When my sister brought Book of Secrets home and made me listen to it I was amazed at the beauty of the entire album.  I had to have  it.    There has to be some surprises, so I will only talk about the tracks  that stand out in my mind. Listening to this album is like taking a trip  through time to a place where dragons and knights in shining armor roam.   Every single track stands out and all are my favorites.  &quot;The  Highwayman&quot;, though the longest song, is a tragic love story which  makes the romatic in anyone long to listen to it again and again hoping for  a happy ending.  While &quot;Mummers' Dance&quot; is the fairy tale.   Listening to this track, I envision a midevil troupe &quot;rambling&quot;  through the Irish hills looking for a castle to stay in for the night.     This album is breathtaking!  Everytime I listen to it I get a lump in my  throat.  Even if you are not a new age fan, I suggest this album for the  times when you need to be transported to another time and place so you can  forget about the outside world and all its turmoil.
B00JCW0BCY|5|Everyone will at some time in their life face critical health choices, whether their own or those of someone they love. The author has no easy answers. But what he does do is gently guide the ready through a process of finding a health care provider who will listen, and presents a number of questions to ask to enable one to make the tough decisions on their own terms. I highly recommend this book for just about anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5|Bingo!  I purchased another great game.  This game is full of endless puzzles!  I spent hours playing game after game.
B002ZG974W|5|So cute, so inocent, so different ways a baby lives its life.

B00992CF6W|5|On Amazon app store get PocketInvEditor<br /><br />It's works with minecraft<br /><br />If you have an Apple product get Pocket Tool. I love both of them
B004ZA9HB4|1|I don't use facebook so how am I supposed to use this?  No, I don't need and won't sign up for facebook.
B007V2UGPE|1|my kindle started locking up after installing and stopped only after uninstalling so......The prices for gold in this game is crazzy high and even if it didn't lock me up I still would have removed it which is sad because what I could play I really liked.
B00004TH7Z|5|As a die hard fan, it's good to have Bruce and Adrian back. Never  slacking, Steve and the boys press onward in yet more intricate melodies  and guitar  work.I saw them in concert in Portland, Maine earlier this  month supporting the Brave New Tour. They may be a bit older and wiser, but  they still play just as hard. Their show just as good as always. I've  always called Maiden Cerebral Metal; metal for the thinking man due to  mythological and literary based lyrics. I hope they continue to put out  such mature metal....up the irons!!!
B009NQKPUW|3|It explains a lot of where the creepy little aliens came from and left its self wide open for a sequel.
158767338X|5|It's awesome I love it!!!
B00KA87GCW|4|I like to play games that have goals (quest) to accomplish. This is one of those games! Lots of FUN!
6305538018|4|its quite a movie. Jennifer Jason Leigh creates a game called eXistenZ and you can tap in threw the back or the bellybutton, one of the two, anyway, at the beginning, a man trys to assassinate her but luckily Jude Law brings her to safety and tries to save her, then a man named Gas trys to kill her, played by Willem Dafoe and then he gets killed. they start tapping into the game and experience reality bending things. imaginative soup gun in that chinese restautant and the end is a twist which it turns out to be an actual game hey are all playing and the 2 are actually assassins themselves. other cast members like Don McKellar(Exotica) with a funked up part, Sarah Polley(GO, The Claim), Ian Holm(The Fifth Element) and Christopher Eccelston(Shallow Grave, Jude, 28 Days Later), add spark to the interesting piece, I read the book and David Cronenberg did an excellent job on the movie as well.
B00AGDY4AI|5|Some of the best chemistry ever on the screen depicted by the Duke and Maureen O'Hara.  This is one of my top John Wayne movies along with the Quiet Man (another great Wayne/O'Hara mix), el Dorado and Rio Bravo.
B00AYR2FOI|4|Boz Scaggs' distinctive voice is richer and grainier than it was when I first became acquainted with his work more than 30 years ago, but some features remain the same. The soul tradition, the emphasis on quality supporting musicians and great production are evident in this latest release. There are some very memorable tracks here -- some of them covers, and to me that speaks to the distinctiveness and superiority of Boz as a vocalist. It's pretty hard to take Loce on a Tow Way Street and make it your own.<br />My 7 YO daughter found this sitting around the house and popped it into her CD player to fall asleep to. And we've been going to sleep with Boz for more than three weeks. As a result I've only heard the second \\"side\\" a few times but am on the whole delighted.
B00DT99BX6|4|Pawn of Innocence is a story of discovery, love and finding your own place in the world. It centres around Camille. A young woman who has everything she could possibly ask for. The only problem is her father. Due to a tragedy that took her mother's life. Camille's father isn't taking any chances with the thing he values most. She is forever watched by bodyguards. As a way to deal with this claustrophobic surveillance, Camille escapes on breaks abroad. Challenging her father's intentions and authority. But little does she realise her father has good cause to fear for her safety. On a trip away everything changes for Camille. She not only finds herself falling in love but running from danger. Unfortunately for Camille danger and love seem to go hand in hand.<br /><br />Pawn of Innocence is a good and enjoyable read. Though the beginning was a little slow, I did not think this affected the story as I enjoyed getting to know the tenacious Camille and her family and friends. For a winter read, this is the book. Filled with wonderful locations, you can easily imagine the rich world Camille inhabits. A world which is helped along with a Sights and Sounds feature. I'd never come across this before. It was an interesting addition.
B00JMI3KSU|4|I thought it was very funny and can't WAIT to see Horrible Bosses 2
B008KYOCA2|1|I was looking forward to my calendars syncing similar to other android devices, but this app does not. Great free app if you don't need multiple calendars.
B00EY8BRGU|2|Very convoluted story line...requires you to suspend all sense of reality. All actors did a good job with a weak script.
B00884GR0W|5|this is an awesome game worth the money but for some reason I cant craft a crafting table but besides that its awesome a must get (if u have money)
B00CWY76CC|5|It is hard ,challenging and a lot of fun !!!!! I couldn't put my kindle down when I got it !! U MUST GET THIS GAME !!!!!!!!
