B004NELBPC|5.0|I love Huffington Post, I like the ability to easily access the site on my kindle.  There are so many topics that they cover besides politics that are worth reading.
B002M65AMI|5.0|The classic release from these guys.  Hard not to love everything on here. Definitely an island classic that everyone should have
B008XG1X18|5.0|I almost regret downloading this app because I use my kindle more for pinning than for reading!  It is a great app and I love the endless supply of ideas!
B000SXOFL4|4.0|Compelling and fluid, the album flows from one song to the next like the movements of a single piece. This is my first Enigma album and I can't stop listening to it.
1449417051|5.0|If you've had cats for any length of time, then you know how well they plot and scheme. In the \\"How to tell if your cat is plotting to kill you\\" calendar, Matthew Inman uses hilarious drawings and entertaining \\"interpretations\\" of cat behavior to unearth their true plans---murder. And maybe world domination. The artwork is silly and fun, and the interpretations of cat behavior are spot-on hilarious.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This product worked just like it was advertised that it would. I am still learning everything it will do.<br />It is nice to look at pictures on the Fire.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|A fun and entertaining movie for women of all ages. If you love gorgeous men then it is highly recommended.
0307593312|4.0|I've read nearly all of Murakami's novels and felt up to the task of tackling this rather thick work of fiction.  There were signature traces of the author throughout the story, motifs and themes that have kept me returning from each title to the next , however I felt that the book was unnecessarily long and drawn out.  While I'm pleased that I finished &#34;IQ84&#34; I can't say that it's my favorite.  I prefer &#34;After Dark&#34; &#34;The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle&#34; and &#34;Hard Boiled Wonderland the End of the World.&#34;
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I got this cover because I can stand up my kindle at an angle which makes watching movies and tv shows easier and more comfortable. I also wanted something that would protect my kindle properly. This cover is very sturdy, and I can put my kindle and the angle I want. Very nice product and well worth the cost, which is still lower than the one Amazon recommends with the kindle and just as good a quality!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book of The Hunger Games series. I don't know what else to say except start reading this series. If you ever had doubts about it, don't think twice just buy it and read it! It's an easy read, won't take up too much of your time, and once you start you wont be able to stop reading! I think this series will become a classic and be added to every high school's lesson plan!
B000L53D4O|4.0|my son is just too small for this product.<br />wait to see how good he can do for this walker after a few weeks.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed this book much better than book one. It is more about the beginning of the real relationship, not the contract based crap of the first book. It is interesting to see how Christian changes and becomes more loving and sensitive.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Once again, Aimee Mann shows us her amazing songwriting abilities with her catchy melodies and clever lyrics.<br />From start to finish, this CD is truly a gem!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I don't care how old you are, this series is amazing! I have recommended this series to everyone! Catching Fire is amazing! It has a really big twist that I didn't see coming. Be warned though, when you get the point in the book of the twist-you will not be able to put the book down until you finish it, and if you do, you will dream about the Hunger Games, and have to get up in the middle of the night to finish it! READ IT!
B009FO908A|5.0|I love love love this song its super catchy and has a fun beat thats great to dance and sing along with!! I love this band and cant wait to see whats next for them!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's THE HUNGER GAMES! I loved this book so much! It gets you hooked from the first page, and keeps you interested the entire time. It is a very easy read, but is not just for teens. I have recommended this book to all of my friends, all of whom have loved it! If you haven't read the book, but watched the movie-don't base your interest on the movie-this is SO MUCH better than the movie! Honestly I don't think the movie made much sense unless you read the book.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I have all the soundrtacks and this one is terrific, i read some of the other reviews, and was suprised when a few people gave it a low rating....A++++++ all the way! Shipment was really fast and the price was perfect...thanks so much ! ;)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After everyone raved about this book forever, I decided to give it a try. I enjoyed some of the book, but mostly I didn't like it. I did read the whole series becasue a friend said they get better, and I wil agree they do. This one really just sets up the basis of their relationship, and it is necessary for the other books. Be warned though it is graphic, and at time a little disturbing.
B004YMSTRQ|5.0|For as long ans Amon Amarth has been around, one would expect them to wear thin, but they are as strong as ever. I just got into Death Metal a few months ago, graduating form ZZ Top and Jonny Lang. I still like those guys, but when I want to shake the dust from the cabinetry, I put on Amaon Amarth.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Very addicting book. A little too on the graphic and raunchy side for me, but something about it keeps me reading!
0345803493|5.0|If you had read the first book on this series,  the second one will just hold your attention until you turn the last page.

B0007Y08II|5.0|This is a laughable porno-puppet dvd movie
B007FG9LIE|1.0|Another dreadful book based on  a seemingly 'good' idea which rapidly became farcical and poorly written. I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone else unless I really didn't like them.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book is confusing with multiple run on sentence, stretched allusions and characters who are hard to follow.  I am half way through the book and don't think I will even finish it
B00966TN1Q|5.0|I like the way Michael Connelly constructs his books, linking the past and the present seamlessly...in this case spanning twenty years. Detective Harry Bosch is again at the forefront of the action and again, Connolly leads the reader in one direction only to have the plot swivel into another direction. Good taut writing and a solid read.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br /><br />In the spring of 2011 my friend Rick Gershon, at Warner Bros. told me about an up and coming blues artist who was making a stop in Oxford. \\"Gary is a pure talent and a pure joy to see live,\\" Rick said. Shortly after that I received Gary Clark Jr.'s Ep and I was blown away.<br />I'm not talking playing at the blues. I'm talking knee deep in the muddy waters. I'm talking comparisons to Stevie Ray Vaughn or even, Jimi Hendrix.<br />Recently Gary cut loose a full debut, Blak and Blu. The album  debuted at #6 on the Billboard Top 100 chart. The first music video from the album, \\"Ain't Messin' Round\\" is in frequent rotation on VH1. He hung out at the network to record their \\"You Oughta Know\\" Live Session.<br />The 28-year-old native of Austin began playing guitar at the age of 12. As a teenager he had already met, and began to play with Jimmie, Stevie Ray Vaughn's brother.<br />He played at the 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festival with Eric Clapton requesting Gary join he, Doyle Bramhall II and Sheryl Crow on stage for their performance. He also played some of his own original material.<br />I really liked the blues rocker \\"Bright Lights.\\" Apparently I wasn't alone. It can be heard in a 2011 Jack Daniel's commercial and also in the 2012 Max Payne 3 videogame. He can get down acoustically too. Just give listen to \\"When My Train Pulls In.\\"<br />Gary credits where he grew up in Texas with his wide range of sounds.<br />\\"I'll tell you this: If I hadn't grown up in Austin, I don't think I'd be doing what I'm doing the way I'm doing it,\\" He said. \\"I always knew I was into music and wanted to be involved in it, but I was 14 or something when I really checked out the scene and started walking around downtown. You could hear a country band, a blues band, a hip-hop crew, whatever. All on the same strip on the same night.\\"
B0015DYIH2|5.0|What I love is that it in not like most vampire novels. When I was young, my mother read the Anne Rice novels and I remember her saying they were scary. Stephenie took it to a different level, instead of scare, she wrote a human and a vampires love story. The details are very imaginative and I liked picturing it before the movies were released. It is time to reread book 4 now that the movie is out. I will read it in one day! I can remember reading book 1 for the first time, it was a cold rainy day, great for cuddling up with a good book, I couldn't put the book down! I love when books have that pull over you! And Stephenie Meyer did just that. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next!!!!
B005LAIHYU|3.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br /><br />We're told that imagination is a terrible thing to waste.<br />In this case filmmakers take one of America's most loved presidents Abraham Lincoln and have him battling the undead.<br />At first I thought the film would be a dark comedy, more tongue and cheek but quickly learned the filmmakers wanted us to take this seriously.<br />The story begins in 1818 with young Abe living with his parents, Nancy and Thomas who work on a plantation, owned by the ruthless Jack Barts. Barts prepares to beat a young African American boy William Johnson. Young Abe jumps to his defense and in the course, gets his family fired.<br />That night, Barts, who is a vampire, comes into the Lincoln home and poisons Abe's sleeping mother.<br />Lincoln grows older with one thought on his mind to kills Barts. He attacks him one night only to discover his enemy has superior power. Abe is saved by Henry Sturges.<br />Sturges tells the young vengeful man about Barts being a vampire and volunteers to teach Abe how to become a vampire hunter. He explains all vampires descended from Adam, a vampire who owns a plantation in New Orleans. He tells of their weakness to silver and gives him a silver pocket watch.<br />Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is fine for escapism fare. It does try to take itself a bit serious, interweaving Lincoln's courtship with Mary Todd, and the background of the Civil War. It is also littered with over the top violence and CGI that kills any believability.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|i have never read a book straight though in a 24 hr period. its now 2 am & my alarm will be screaming at me in 4 hrs but there was no way i could not finish Slammed by Colleen Hoover<br /><br />there have been many books that have made me an emotional basket case ( The Lovely Bones & When I See You) but this book had real meaning, life lessons to take a minute & actually ponder over. nthis is one ill pass on to my daughter when shes old enough to appreciate the meaning behind the 'slam's.<br /><br />i highly recommend this book. its not smut or a murder mystery just a damn good read!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have an high end system (i7, 16gb ram, 500gb SSD, GTX 560 SLI, z68-v pro mobo,) I do a lot of 3d graphics and rendering that use up a lot of cpu.<br /><br />With the stock fan that came with the i7 I was getting temps of 35-40 idle and over 101 when rendering scenes or baking ambient occlusion which pushed all my cores to 100% cpu usage. I couldn't even run prime95 for more then a few minutes without my computer shutting down due to overheating. Now with the new fan I am sitting around 20 idle and max of 55 after rendering a scene for over an hour (which was previously impossible)<br /><br />The only thing i didn't like (which is very minor and more of me being lazy) is the fact that I had to take my mobo out of the case and install the mounting hardware onto the back of the computer. Fortunately the included instructions were easy to follow and cooler master has plenty of videos specific to installation.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone!
B004G600A4|5.0|A fine and FUN Christmas gift for young granddaughters, and  just the right ages to enjoy. Great price too. Thanks, Amazon.com
B005VGUA5S|4.0|Interesting music, variety of playful sounds. A couple of songs have foreign language flavor. I was turned on to them in a recent CBS Sunday Morning story.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|After the preview rest of movie is a total let down. This is one of those movies that all the best of the best is placed in the preview clips. I actually walked out near the end of the show, I have only done that 2 times prior, in over 30 years of movie going.
1553655427|5.0|Author Dambisa Moyo blows the lid off the Western aid program to Africa showing how Africa despite billions and billions of dollars in aid since the end of colonialism has regressed as a continent economically. The book is short and sweet because the author can write. I see there are complaints by other reviewers but she's not writing a thesis or a report for the World Bank. I'm sure she's done that before given her educational and working background.<br /><br />What Moyo has done has shown how aid is pure folly in the vast majority of cases and how, mainly China now, is showing what direct investment in Africa can do. There are successes pre-China into Africa that Moyo covers such as Botswana which show that outside of the big boys of South Africa and Egypt that African nations can get their act together.<br /><br />The fun thing about the book is she breaks it all down by introducing a fictional typical African nation called Dongo to some chapters to show how her theories may play out. Look, let's get over the idea she has all the answers. At least she is presenting an interesting argument and one that most aid workers will readily admit is true (at least off the record).<br /><br />All in all, it's a must-read for anyone interested in the global economy, Africa and aid in general.
1608871452|5.0|I am so pleased with this book, so much stuff to play with, much more than I was expecting.  The pictures are worth the price and all the goodies are just icing on the cake.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is back at it, front to back, non stop thriller, could not put it down!  I highly recommend this read to anyone, especially to followers of Vince Flynn.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|High Quality dramatic television. A must see!! I am a big fan of quality drama but rarely find something that is this well done.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved loved loved reading Wool.  The story  is so interesting and the characters are just perfect.  There were literally times where I would think \\"Why am I not reading Wool right now?\\"  It is so amazing that an author can just create a world and story like this from their imagination.  I have and will continue to recommend this book to everyone.  I very much look forward to continuing with this series!  I am so glad I found about about this book on the Self Publishing Podcast.
B003L77GG0|3.0|I bought this DVD set to finish out my collection of all 10 seasons and liked the picture/color quality about as much as anything in the season. The series may have gone on too long for it's own good, I think the writing really began slipping with the conclusion of the high school years (which season was that?). Someday I'll get around to watching this set, probably won't ever go Blu-ray unless it's really cheap and covers all 10 seasons.<br />It's been months since I looked my set over but I think #10 even had the weakest set of extras of the series.
B005IQZB14|5.0|(This review is from Nancy Ruhle, not Philip.)<br />Cheryl Strayed has written a brutally honest, gripping book that mesmerized me. I finished the book wishing I could meet her in person. Cheryl is a terrific writer.
1401322786|4.0|An unusual tale that emphasizes our use of time and how it's valued in our life.  It makes you think more deeply about your choices and the paths you follow as you spend your time.....and what is really the most important.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always Mr. Grisham keeps you guessing and wondering what will happen next! Can't wait for the next book.<br />Very suspenseful !
B003RNXIBK|3.0|Another good album from Eminem.  He seems to have calmed down emotionally and his music isn't as catchy as it used to be.  This is a solid album for his fans, and it was a good buy digitally, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  Very suspensful.  I could not put it down.  The book was told from the point of view of different characters and that added to the suspense.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|I bought WALL-E several years ago both on the strength of the Pixar reputation and the quality of the animation.<br /><br />The quality of the animation is very good, better than the story. The story itself?, I couldn't help feeling that somehow it needed trimming for length somehow, somewhere. I don't even remember just what the extras were like but being Pixar they'll have something good.
0143113100|5.0|this book has given me so much hope for myself, some family members as well as for the clients I work with. We can change our brains--they are the most amazing instruments. Too many people wander around thinking that they are stuck--when they aren't.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A discovery of witches is a fast page turner full of excitement, with a unique story line involving witches, vampires, and deamons.
B004856SQ8|4.0|I am not a professional product rater such as appears on Amazon so much (are they paid by companies to do this?), just a regular person.  As such I am not going to tell you all about the movie, why would i do that? the fun is in the viewing I don't need to know everything before i start watching a movie but whether other people really liked it.  Now i admit i am not a hard core &#34;this movie has to be perfect for me to like it&#34; type of movie person.  I just want to be entertained and I have found some movies that aren't rated that high by the professionals in newspapers or online to be perfectly fine and enjoyable.  I don't recall what the true professionals gave this movie (and haven't read what the amazon professional raters say) but I laughed and laughed watching this movie.  It is a hoot.
B001IF252M|5.0|I have a tv that uses a VGA in for a laptop but I have a MacBook Pro 13 inch 2011 mid.<br />The MacBook has mini display port not VGA so I had to get the adapter. Since I got it I have bin using it since.<br />i have had no problems.
B007EECSFA|3.0|Characters are well-developed.  I generally enjoy books about WWII set in England and this one gave a different picture of London during the Blitz.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|Not the best of films but has a lot of action, notable for a teen girl being the lead character and doing most of that action. Kind of off to a vague start but eventually you'll see Hanna get her revenge on those who created her (I figured out that she was &#34;created&#34; before the movie got around to revealing that). Sometimes had its odd bits like Hanna and her friend kissing, and the unbelievable Internet search Hanna did (raised by &#34;father&#34; to get revenge but taught nothing of computers and web searching yet she does brilliantly anyway?) yet Saorise Ronan did an excellent job with what must've been a hard role to perform.<br />I didn't like the way the viewer is just left hanging as to Hanna's future, the alternate ending in which she returns to her Arctic cabin home helped that only a little.<br />It's worth watching, maybe Miss Ronan has a future in action roles.
B00318EDD8|3.0|This 3 CD set is OK, but understand what you are buying.  Disk One is the original album remastered.  It is a solid 4 star CD and is well worth having.<br /><br />Disk Two, is mostly \\"home demos, band rehearsals\\".  These are mostly instrumental versions with poor sonic quality that I cannot imagine listening to over and over. It's just NOT a pleasant listen.<br /><br />Disk Three is a live version of the whole studio CD.  This would be great if these were inspiring performances, but they are not and do not offer much in the way of alternative interpretations of the songs.  The live CD also brought to my attention what a limited vocalist that Robert Smith is.  Apparently in the studio he can compensate for this, but in this live show, his limitations are very apparent.<br /><br />If you are a hard core fan of The Cure, you will probably want this.  But if you just like good music, the original CD should be enough.

However I have read sci-fi and fantasy for decades now (and i read a lot so I have read many authors) and I started reading Kevin earlier this year.  Really enjoy his books they are a fun and interesting read, I can't imagine you would be disappointed if you tried him.  I choose 4 stars because it's pretty foolish to think very many people or products are so perfect as to rate 5 stars....but this author is a very very strong 4 stars.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Who would've thought a story about star-crossed teens battling terminal cancer could be such an engaging, not to mention uplifting read? But that is what John Green manages in this lovely novel.<br /><br />His protagonist, 16-year old Hazel Grace Lancaster, who suffers from thyroid cancer, and her love interest, 17 year-old Augustus Waters (an amputee to osteosarcoma) are surely two of the most precocious, appealing, and believable teens to populate fiction in ages. Their wise-beyond-years, and often very funny conversations, keep the novel from slipping into saccharine/maudlin territory--which isn't to say that the novel doesn't strum the reader's emotions. It does. In fact, I recommend keeping a box of Kleenex handy.<br /><br />Green's memorable novel deals with the very human struggle to accept the reality of death; but more to the point, it addresses how important it is to accept -- and make the most of -- whatever life presents.  Even when the hand we're dealt isn't pleasant.  Or fair.
0375703764|2.0|I'd been looking for a modern classic horror novel. Something that broke the rules. Reviews, articles, and must-read lists kept mentioning this one. The sincerely large number of reviews here and elsewhere, as well as the existence of web forums explicitly devoted to this book all led me to believe there was something special here.<br /><br />Others have mentioned, this is a story being told about a person telling a story about a guy writing a manuscript about a documentary movie that doesn't exist. All of the ingredients are ripe here for a really mind blowing \\"found footage\\" style exploration. The presentation is excellent, the book is a serious thing to hold in your hands, rife with footnotes, appendices, excerpts with pictures and a layout that would probably make any type-setter cringe in fear.<br /><br />I was seriously hoping for a real mental enigma that might not come off as your standard narrative, and take some real head scratching with plenty of external references to get my head around. I'm often much happier with stories which don't ultimately spell it all out, but leave a lot up to the imagination. Stories which might not even come full circle and result in open ended threads of plot left to the reader to wonder about forever are some of the best out there.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while this book sets us all up for that experience, it never delivers. The primary tale-teller in the book is slowly being driven mad by the events unfolding around him. Not at all unlike many of the protagonists in many of Lovecraft's short stories. The only problem here is that unlike Lovecraft's work, the main story teller in HoL is utterly unlikable and completely uninteresting. The author subjects us to page after page of his mundane ramblings and comings and goings, sexual conquests and dissapointments, while leaving the reader devoid of any emotional attachment to his outcome. I can't be concerned or even intrigued about his descent into insanity as he's never made compelling to me, and what's happening to him is so abstract and far removed by pages of filler text, I ultimately want to end up skipping ahead to the good parts.<br /><br />There is a good story here, that of the house itself, and the explorations therein. The only problem is that narrative could have been better presented as a compelling short story that would have left me sufficiently unsettled, even if it left things as inconclusive, my investment level would have been less and therefore my expectations not as high.<br /><br />With a reading investment this sufficiently weighty, I would have hoped for a better return on that investment than the empty feeling I had as I turned the final page.<br /><br />I read another reviewer here say that the whole thing reads like a massive inside joke to some sub-culture that I'm clearly not privy to. I can only hope that is the case, here, otherwise this is clearly a labor of love that's missed its intended scope of impact.<br /><br />Perhaps I'll put this on the shelf and revisit it some day and some esoteric lock will click open in my brain and I'll enjoy it as thoroughly as others seem to, and as I'd hoped to myself, but right now I'm not inclined to recommend this one, and that's something I'm sad to say.compelling to me, and what's happening to him is so abstract and far removed by pages of filler text, I ultimately want to end up skipping ahead to the good parts.<br /><br />There is a good story here, that of the house itself, and the explorations therein.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Some people like the earlier movies (4-6 in the final count), my brother among them, others prefer the final three (1-3 I guess they're called) I just wanted to be sure I could have them in HD format. I'm really vague about what I'm getting, hoping that while Lucas may have &#34;cleaned up&#34; the FX in the older movies that he didn't &#34;improve&#34; them like he did on at least one DVD release. I've read a little of Amazon's text and some of the reviews here- I'm still not sure what I've got.v
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would call this book as well as the previous two books a must read for anyone whom watched and enjoyed the movie. The books are fantastic
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I accidentally found her and I'm ever so glad I did. I love this young lady's voice and her appreciation for music. Not one of her songs sounds the same. However, they all do have sounds of the 80's. As a 42 year old woman who is clearly not \\"hip\\", nor is trying to be, I enjoyed every song on here. I've subscribed to her channel on YouTube and look forward to hearing more from her. Like Adele, she's a breath of fresh air and her sound can be appreciated by all generations.
B000W91RUG|5.0|She fell in love with the guys while she was here in the USA, and I think that when she opens it for Christmas, she will be blown away to be able to come back here in her mind whenever she pops this into the DVD player...<br />Bazinga!
B009GEDP26|5.0|This is the best series I have watched! I highly recommend it! You will not stop watching it! I watched seasons 1-4 and all what was available in season 5 in less than two months.

B005723JSQ|5.0|Sometimes I think her books can be a hit or miss, but this one has joined my list of all time favorite Chick Lit books.  I didn't think any would come close to her book, Can You Keep  A Secret?, which I think is by far her best, but this comes a close second.  Hilarious, sweet and thoroughly entertaining!  You can't help but love the characters and laugh at loud at the situations!
076790592X|5.0|In 2005, I went back to school - i was 38 years old, a single mom of 4 and i was a former high school dropout. I am proud to say that I graduated that year, the same time as my oldest daughter. Prior to graduating, i had to take several english classes; in one, we had to read Tuesdays with Morrie ~ I LOVED IT and devoured every single word.<br /><br />Afterwards we were told to write our life stories, using the format of taking a particular incident in our lives and tell how it changed our lives. I couldnt tell my story in 1,500 words or less. I submitted over 7,000 words, using the recent find of my adoptive mother in the hospital. We had been estranged for several years because she was highly abusive and i had to walk away for my own sanity. My subsequent reactions and emotions came as a surprise so i was eager to examine this further. When I got my assignment back, my teacher only had one comment - she couldnt grade it, and she encouraged me to explore it further and one day publish it.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2012, and I did just that. This spring I published Finding Gloria- my personal memoir of survival. So many things happened to me after 2005, that my entire life was turned upside down. I was able to finally find the healing i needed after decades of abuse, self loathing and deprivation.<br /><br />So yes, I have to say THANK YOU - if it hadnt been for Tuesdays with Morrie, I would never have learned how to tell a good memoir - and while my story is far from perfect, I can proudly say that it is changing people's lives, encouraging the voiceless to speak out and touching people around the world.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Marianne Curtis<br />Author of Finding Gloria, Moondust and Madness: a collection of poetry, Behind Whispering Pines and Finding Gloria ~ Second Edition
B0086700CM|4.0|Many hours of enjoyment for kids and adults.  Sometimes it hesitates, which can really mess up your game, but for a free app, its great.
B00973DDN2|4.0|This is good. You will like, if you like The Killers, after a few listens.<br /><br />Five more words are required.
B004LQGXPA|3.0|To be honest, I do not particularly enjoy war movies in the first place. This movie was very funny, but I was extremely bored in the serious parts, most likely do to my dislike of war movies.
B00004YM0D|5.0|Early 1970's music at its finest! Perfect for anyone who grew up in the time period. A Baby-boomer's delight to the ears. Some Mo-town and a few other classic songs, this music is becoming appealing to the next generation.
B003M0H4NG|5.0|If you love Miles Davis you will really enjoy this cd/dvd set. The dvd was a wonderful surprise. Most music &#34;concert dvds&#34; are not well filmed. This dvd take you there and you get to really see the musicians performing.  Highly recommended.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I love this movie. The price was great and the shipping was very fast. If you like the Beatles, all of the songs in this movie are Beatle's songs just sang by different artists.The movie is very artistic and engaging. Love it!
B007TXN4TK|4.0|If I had something larger than a kindle fire, I would buy the full version of this application.  It is fun for all ages and could be an excellent tool for encouraging the inner musician.
B008MM9630|5.0|how can you not love this game?  you grow plants, raise animals,  build homes, make friends, and save princes.  I love this game so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Merry Christmas, Baby by Rod Stewart.<br />I love the &#34;old&#34; Rod Stewart. Brings back lots of memories. The new Rod Stewart is making new memories
B003954I9C|5.0|I first got this as a digital download, but I FINALLY broke down and had to have the actual CD. I've been listening to this on my mp3 player in the car for a while now and I fell in love with it when I first heard it. I've always loved AJ's voice and the unique quality it has. I've been a BSB fan for at least 15 years and I always will be, but WOW! This album really shows what he can do! I love the instruments, the \\"big band\\" sound he's created and the way it's all put together. He is the \\"bad boy\\", so some of what he sings about is the be expected. My favorite songs are \\"I Quit\\", \\"I Hate it When You're Gone\\" and \\"Sincerely Yours\\". \\"I Quit\\" makes me think of my ex and all the stuff he put me through and it's just a great song. I get hyped up every time it comes on. People seeing me driving down the street carrying on, blasting this song probably think I've lost my mind, but I don't care! LOL \\"I Hate it When You're Gone\\" makes me a little sad, but it re minds me of my other ex. We had a relationship like the song describes. And when I first heard \\"Sincerely Yours\\" I knew it was about his father. I didn't have to read it online to know right away what that song was about. Oh, and I also love \\"Gorgeous\\"! The way he sings like Prince is awesome!! I know he said he met Prince and that's why he got inspired to do a song like that, but WOW! He did such a great job on the entire album. I could go on and on about it all day. My friend's husband thinks I'm nuts to be so obsessed about one guy! LOL Seriously, I just know what he's been through and growing up \\"with\\" the Backstreet Boys is what I've done.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed these books. I will say that they are for a mature adult I found the story line to be very interesting.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|Elf is a great holiday movie fun for all ages. Sure there might be a joke here or there where you might find questionable but I just figure kids wont get it. I watch this movie at least 15 times between Thanksgiving and Christmas.<br />As for the quality of the Blu-ray I give it a 4 star. Not 5 because when I received the movie the packaging was slightly unwrapped. Other then that evrything was great. The movie played with out a hitch and for this low price how could you not buy it?
B004NELBPC|5.0|Keep informed, stay on top of important topics and rely on this news source as a rational, unbiased reporting agency, both nationally and internationally
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is indispensable if you are thinking of  publishing on KDP. And since it is free, it is a non-brainer.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I was a little unsure of this movie because I do not typically enjoy musicals, but I LOVED this movie.  All the actors were great, the music was outstanding and the story line was good.  I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to sit back and enjoy themselves!
0385344333|4.0|What can I say --- I enjoyed this one.  It probably is not my favorite all time Reacher novel; but some of it was classic Jack Reacher at his best and that is what I was expecting.  The plot did seems to dangle out there and was a bit hard to nail down exactly who was doing what to whom; but Reacher was being Reacher throughout, so I just stayed along for the ride.<br /><br />For me to ending was pretty typical ... he did what he does, he survived, and pretty much faded into the sunset (as it were).<br /><br />Some of the descriptive set-ups almost made me come out of my chair, they were so vivid; and what my mind created from Lee Child's words was marvelous.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that so many people seemed to be disappointed in this one.  I was not, and I have and will recommend it to my friends who are also Jack Reacher Junkies.<br /><br />I'd like to add that I am horribly disappointed that Tom Cruise was cast in the role of Jack Reacher for the upcoming movie.  He is not the man for this job.  Too small, too pretty -- I can't imagine that the character of Jack Reacher can even been slightly brought to reality by Tom Cruise.  I was hoping for Bruce Willis!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is very Classic Vince Flynn! Well done.  I had pre-ordered this book. He never disappoints! He can't seem to write fast enough!
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I just got this today, and I listened to it already twice. This is a very average album by Van the man, that barely makes it to 3 stars rating. It does not meet the high expectations I had after reading several excellent reviews, which means:<br />a) I should not trust reviews<br />b) I should not have such high expectations for music (or things, or people...)<br />I give all songs 3 stars, except for 'If in Money We Trust' (2 stars) and 'End of the Rainbow' (4 stars).<br />The song 'Pagan Heart' is a bad copy of 'Ordinary People' found in Van's Philosopher Stone double CD. Just listen to the guitar at the beginning and you will agree with me. This is a blues tune that completely lacks passion and feel. This cd can be dull at times, like in the track 'Pagan Heart' 'If in Money We Trust.' which is such a crime for a guy like Van. I do not recommend buying this CD.
B002GJU54E|4.0|As usual this is a funny book with surprises.  It is hard not to laugh out loud when one reads her books.
B009Y2KGSQ|4.0|I listened to some tracks from this album on Rolling Stone and liked what I heard. I then read some of the reviews and almost second guessed buying it. I am so glad I did. I've been a fan since the early days and found this album to be a solid return to great riffs and lyrics.
B00753MBHA|5.0|I'm so happy that Accept didn't wait too long & released such a fabulous recording.  They wrote an intelligent album with very well researched/ interesting lyrical content as well, quite nice.  Who cares if this is or isn't better than Blood of the Nations, the riffs and the lead guitar playing are blazing on this album as well as the awesome bass playing from Peter Baltes.  The songs just flow effortlessly, not a single song here to skip over.  It would appear that the band is gelling together nicely & the songwriting is some of the strongest of their career.  There is no question that Wolf Hoffman & Herman Frank are quite the formidable guitar duo, they play off each other gracefully and just as well as some of the other more notable metal guitar legends do.  Passionate vocals with grit, that is Mark Tornillo & he kills it on this album.  I doubt we shall hear any complaints about Mark Tornillo now with a 2nd album that is this strong.  From the very opener of Hung Drawn & Quartered the band is firing on all cylinders, with quick paced upbeat songs.  In essence, the first 4 songs just set the pace and are some of my fav's on this album.  The Quick & The Dead & The Galley close the album nicely, really tastefully done as one is another raucous guitar festival with the closer having a bit of a 70's vibe to it, clearly the least \\"metal\\" of the songs but with a real flow that just smoothly sails along.  To see a band of their era put out 2 albums of this quality in the past 4 years is simply amazing & I look forward to this new era of Accept & surely hope it gets them a bigger fanbase that may have missed them the first time around the block !
B007SGM084|5.0|I was hesitant to buy any of these, but after borrowing a friend's Fifty Shades of Grey I was hooked immediately and so bought all three.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept me reading, however a bit predictable. The whole time your back and forth on who your routing for. Worth reading!
B00425S1H8|5.0|After installing the drivers from the CD onto my windows 8 laptop, the device worked the first time! Many of the serial to USB converters can be quite glitchy so I was surprised when it worked so well. Also my other adapter is not compatible with Windows 8. Good product at a cheap price!
B002SYXCVK|4.0|Sting sings in a lower voice on most of these mostly ancient songs (probably researched during his lute period). I like the unusual feel to the album. Not good if you want a cheery Christmas album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app.  I am a fan of solitaire and this application makes it fun to play.  There are diffent games to play
B008FYZIVY|3.0|The production work is amazing and the acting is high quality. The plot line is like watching a seismograph as an earth quake is starting which starts tame and by the end is a bunch of crazy scribbles . Don't get me wrong, I like an intricate plot, but the longer this series goes the less I believe the viability of it.
B007G92QGO|4.0|This is an interesting legal thriller. A story set in small town has all the interesting components of family drama, psycho-social thought and interesting way of narration. The story moves back and forth between flashback and present and keeps you glued. I see a lot of potential for it to be made into a film. If indeed one makes it, it would be a huge success!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Sure, there were some holes to the plot, but there are some in all of the Alien franchise.<br /><br />Fasbender is a great android.  Can't have an Alien movie without an android.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next movie.  They left it wide open!
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Only half way through and I'm already depressed about finishing this before he writes some more.  Teeming with characters that could occupy their own story and the hint of old friends.  For the very beginning of The Blade Itself I've been hooked into this world.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|...So good. haven't had any problems since the processor upgrade using this stuff. I've used it on three different computers now and still have more in the tube.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|It is a nice app and you are able to do the very basics on LinkedIn.  However, I felt it was limited on what I could view.  I can see more information from the app on my iphone.  I also had trouble figuring out how to Sign Out.
B009YU62H2|4.0|If you liked Soundgarden and still enjoy listening to their music occasionally, you'll love this album. It has much of the mix of sounds of old Soundgarden.
0547564651|5.0|Bought it for all our teachers. It validates what we have been doing and gives us a direction to go in the future.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|This book gives a pretty good look at why the Higgs Boson is so important. It also goes pretty in depth about the physics of the Higgs. It was a little over my head at times. It's still a great book, though.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|Ordered two of these and 2 of the 60 watt equivalents from Amazon. I initially bought the 60 watt ones for reading lamps in the living room and computer room. These were a little too bright for this application so I figured I would order the 50s and use the 60s elsewhere. The 50s arrived and I installed them in the reading lamps and these were a little too bright as well, but acceptable. The color temperature of both of these were good. I will use the 60 watt ones elsewhere where a brighter light is required. I did some measurements on the 50 watt ones and they actually consume only 5 watts. The power factor is only 0.5. An equivalent CFL previously installed in the fixture measured 12 watts and PF of 0.6. The payback over the CFL will be longer but the LED lamps should be far more reliable. The CFls start getting flaky when the temp gets below 60 deg. or so. The LEDs don't care. I will be ordering more of these going forward.
0345803493|5.0|The media portrayal of this book says it all. The second book is &#34;lighter&#34; than the first and the plot is good.
B008C401YG|4.0|I love this guy's voice. So big, so weird, so deep. I heard him on the radio that when he started singing his voice scared him. It's that special! The lyrics are sometimes strange and, to me, bizarre, but a couple are utter gems. The style of the songs quite eclectic, but it's the voice -- that voice -- that keeps me coming back.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I think that not only was the raid part of the story interesting but all the information and background on the training, deployments, other ops and the insight into the operator's lives was very refreshing. The background about the authors early life and his drive and motivation shows the sheer determination, skill, audacity and the mindset it takes to do this type of work. An easy read and I recommend it.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Although it isn't as great as the previous ones, it's a great addition to the series. Milla Jovovoich is great and I couldn't picture anyone else in this part.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Fits in your pocket, cheap, does a great job. I sharpened all of my kitchen knives with it to a razor edge.
0060989157|5.0|This book was a great read.  I've been a big Motley Crue fan since the 80's and to hear how they treat each other is just hysterical, typical family life.  I was sad with Vince's story of his precious little girl passing away.  I totally understand some of the pain as I've lost all three of my sisters, two died 3 days apart. It was hard to deal with but losing a daughter Must be the most excruciating pain to have to bear.  Nikki, ah that guy must have been my twin in another life. Mick, is a no pitty type of guy he has the most respect from me than any of the others the pain the man lives in daily and still he keeps Rocking!  Tommy, what a trip. seems as though he would be a great friend to whom ever, I think he appears to stay drunk or doped up through out the entire book.. What a great drummer though.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was recommended to me last week. I finished it today, and kind of want to read it again immediately. As a child of the 80s, the references were fantastic, the story a page turner, and the characters both believable and worthy of suspension of said belief when the time was right.<br /><br />I would suggest this book to literally anyone. Just amazing.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|i know these books are really popular and i did get through the first one: by the end it was finally getting exciting! with the second i felt i was plunged back into this boring diatribe about who was son of so and so and cousin to such and such and who was heir to blah and blah. i really like the characters but the writing is so heavy handed i think i'll just watch the mini series.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|but still a must have for any Nicolas Cage fan.  Obviously we liked the movie well enough to buy it.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out! I just had to get it on blu-ray! Sadly I lost my copy on DVD so when I saw it was so cheap on Amazon I just had to pick it up!
0679720200|3.0|A story needs a hero. Camus tells a story well enough, and I have no real faults with the translation, but the protagonist, Meursault, is no hero. This book has been over-reviewed, but I am adding to the plethora of comments anyway.<br /><br />Reading this book as an adult, I can only conclude that the author and the protagonist were both quite functional though severely depressed, and as this book is a part of our education system from high school to college, I hope readers have the sense to realize that, and not merely think \\"ooooh, iconoclasm and nihilism and sadness -- how smart and profound!\\"<br /><br />The only way Meursault could have been the way he was, was not so much his being a sociopath, but rather because of an overriding, long-term depression. He was sensitive, yet insensitive. Self-absorbed to the maximum, yet a participant in life as a social being. Kind and polite, yet apathetic to the point of shooting someone dead because the sun was too hot and he wasn't feeling quite well, and not experiencing any pangs of conscience later.<br /><br />Those who cling to the idea that Meursault was evil have their points, but I stick to my depression diagnosis (as a non-psychologist!) noting his conversation with the priest near the end, as he was coming near his date with the guillotine, and Meursault burst out with a rant including, basically, saying \\"life is terrible and everybody knows it\\". Looking at the story as a whole, that was how he always felt. That expression really becomes the basis for the book, but not as a vaguely Buddhist realization, but the final \\"tell\\" that this man always felt this way, and it was the overwhelming, chronic sadness that made him who he was, and do what he did. Was he sad at his mother's funeral? He was sad all his life, or at least all his adult life, so why would even a loss that profound register? The man was just gone. He tried to be a nice guy, and was somehow functional. He worked. He was never belligerent. He sought happiness in the one basic way that was left to him: the company of a woman. But he was clearly warped into super apathy by his disorder.<br /><br />Meursault's (Camus's) conclusion was acceptance and defiance in the face of the misery of life, as he planned to march to his death and hope there was a big crowd to see it and cheer for his blood. An Existentialist might pick up on this as a call to arms, to be stoic if not aggressive in the face of the pain of life and spit in its face; but the fact that this story was expressed to the public, and the public accepted it as literature and philosophy rather than a cry for help, was nothing more than a sort of reification of the cliche that misery loves company.
1416511946|5.0|Nikki Sixx is an awesome guy who refused to give up his dream.  I think we've lived similar lives (expect I never did or do drugs and rarely drink) the way we feel about our family is so unreal.  I enjoy his views on how he got help and has changed his life. What an inspiration to others realizing that someone of his stature can change and show that you can still have a life worth living without the drugs and alcohol.  Everyone has problems and deals with them differently (hince the fact individuals) but drugs and alcohol do not solve the problem.  Fighting doesn't solve them either.  Facing them head on and focus on the positive changes everything.  Life is good.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I would HIGHLY recommend this book as well as the whole Mitch Rapp series.  Very well written.  The only problem is that there's not another one to read...<br /><br />REALLY need a movie or series of movies.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|the funny thing about my &#34;crush&#34; on Gabriel Macht is that I didn't have it until the last eposide of Suits season 2 when Harvey & Mike were stoned in Mikes apt and he smiled....the lines around his eyes and he was fun......I am addicted !!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Actually really decent acting and graphics.  I was very plesently surprised.  My husband even felt this was worthy of paying the extra for a blue ray.
0446580848|5.0|A big departure in type of plot and setting than what it was originally in Plum Island, but this is all John Corey.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|This a movie with a strong story line and a great script!  The characters are all so believable, and so well acted.  Stands up very well to repeat viewings.  Just when you thought they didn't make 'em like this anymore!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book kept me turning pages and taking the time to read every day. Intense! I loved it. I love her writing style. It keeps the reader intrigued and wanting more when the book is over.
B000FS9FC6|3.0|The movie was good. But the DVD full screen edition was 4:3 scale. Not the 16:9 scale that I was looking for.<br />It did not described 4:3 scale full screen. Otherwise, I would just get the widescreen edition.
B001QOGYFO|5.0|anything that has Gabriel Macht in it, I enjoy. I  was surprised by Alexs accent, sorry that Tom Skeritt was the bad guy
B009HV2JT8|4.0|actually not a bad movie.  There is one bad computer generated sceen (running on the backs of horses) but other then that a good enough movie to see several times.  Worth buying
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I have two sets in my possession and I couldn't make one good set from both boxes.  Quality control is terrible, my sets had warps, scratches (first pic in the user pics section), fingerprints (you would think they would use gloves to handle the records) skipping issues (on the White Album no less), pressing issues (4 of the albums in the first box, three of the albums in the second box), off center stamping (on side 2 of Abby Road), etc.  A cornucopia of flaws.  So they are both going back to Amazon.<br /><br />For those of you who wrote that you had a good set I implore you to listen to your albums once again but this time with headphones.  I didn't initially catch a lot of the flaws with my speakers.  It wasn't until a really bad section on side 2 of Let It Be that I decided to listen again with headphones.  Just so you know, I'm not picky.  I have many used albums that sound a lot better than this new set.  For comparison, I listened to my bought new in 1983 The Human League \\"Dare\\".  No pressing problems and it's a dead quiet flawless record.<br /><br />My set up is as follows:  Denon DP-47f with a Denon DL-110 (with less than 50 hours of play).
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I really like this movie and would recommend, can't remember too much though, but movie was great. See for yourself.
B002SYXCVK|3.0|Interesting adn unusual selection of songs - If a Sting fan it's a decent album to add to your collection
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved it!!!  I enjoy the story of their survival and the ability to still have passion.  I'm excited to read the next book.
B00544L9EI|4.0|Still listen to this over a year later! Not the best as far as Eminem albums but one solid callabo! Royce shines a lot when paired with Em. And Em stops all the silliness and accents and gets down to business to stay with Royce's more street/harder flow. Royce shows he can keep up with Em's rhyme cadences and the themes all seem to work well. So overall, solid 4/5
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Some wonderful early versions of well known and loved songs  serve as a reminder of the talent of the quiet Beatle..
B005IQZB14|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I am not an outdoorsman, so I can't attest to the veracity, but I found it entertaining and emotional.
B005PK553C|5.0|I love this show Season 1 though of every season. Season 2 is not good at all in my opinion.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I love that when I want a book for my Kindle or iPad, I have it within seconds from Amazon. That still amazes me. Stephen King is in great form and the book immediately grabs you. Haven't finished it yet (849 pages), but enjoying every word.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Best book of the trilogy<br />Gets darker and darker with each book<br />Can't wait for the movie to come out
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast paced and gripping. Keeps the reader constantly guessing. Holds your attention and won't let go. John Grisham at his finest.
B0026NZR98|5.0|I really enjoy Tom Hanks in all of his movies , and this one is one of the best he has made .
B009186JNO|5.0|Incredible footage, hilarious backstage and after hours Mick and Keith.  Great band in a chaotic set of concerts, loved it!
B002APU580|5.0|I really like this movie cause it is old and romantic. It is long and that is good and the actors are great.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|Probably my fault, but I wish it had been more obvious that this product doesn't open flat.  For the price, I thought it was like the one I have for my old Kindle that holds the unit while you use it.  This is a silly useless product.  I wish I had really looked at it before buying... Especially since it cost $30. Too bad for me, but look twice before you buy!
1936608618|5.0|The behemoth of a training guide is very well laid out, boasts intuitive queues and excellent photo illustration. A must have instruction guide for any CrossFit completest.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|love this show.<br />Very exciting.<br />can't wait until the next one!<br /><br />Acting is incredible, Saul, Brody, and Carrie make you feel like it's really happening!
B000OVLINI|5.0|This novel falls into the category of literary fiction.  It has many twists and turns, plots and subplots, and despite its often dark tone, is immensely entertaining and engrossing.  This is the best of the novels I read in 2011 -- and I read a lot!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was a fairly good story with a rather complex plot that sort of unraveled at times.  Some of the events were a bit unbelievable even considering that this is a work of fiction.<br /><br />Also, in my opinion, many of these works by famous writers are overpriced for the kindle editions.  After all, one reads the book and it's gone into the archives probably never to be seen again.  They are not worth the $12.99 or $14.99 for the kindle editions even though the writers (I don't think I have to mention the writers' names; you know who they are) are beginning to run on empty.  As the financial folks like to point out in their analysis of a certain stock's performance, &#34;Past performance is no indication of future performance&#34;.  All I ask is that Amazon do a better job of vetting their products and price them accordingly.
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|Philosophical, beautiful, and informative. I loved it. George was and is a wonderful man. RIP my friend. A young man from Liverpool affected so many.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Silly, fun, frustrating and challenging.  I've only seen the first few on the first level.  It seems lime the game will take a long time to get all the way through.  Very entertaining without making your brain hurt!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|My daughter loves Hello Kitty and she enjoys playing the game. I would have given 5 starts if they made it more interesting for kids to earn stuff more freely.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Very good but it starts off a little slow and is confusing if you have not read the rest of the series
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. Fun and very addictive.  Highly recommend.  Good graphics and fun for all levels of skill.<br /><br />Wish tethered were more like it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a Fun app to waste time with. If you are looking to be unproductive, this is the app for you! Lol
B002BWP49C|5.0|The movie was in brand new condition and just as I expected it to be!  Wonderful purchase!  Thank you! :)
B009329Y30|4.0|Why do some people die in war and others live? Why do some people find true love while others fight loneliness? This story covers both questions in a fun and not too dark drama.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|The is a great new force which will spread clearer thinking about decision making and the role of prediction in life. It avoids complicated math and holds your interest with gambling, basketball, baseball and even serious subjects like earthquakes and terrorist strikes. I particularly liked the explanations of why medical tests like mammograms are not necessarily bad news when they come up positive, so much so that I'm using the ideas and graphics in my teaching and in other communication projects I do. It even surprisingly pays homage to Donald Rumsfeld and unknown-unknowns, so it's not just for pointy-headed liberals.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Loved the movie the first time I saw it 2010. Really like the BluRay edition now. If I can be just a little critical of this first movie it was that the editing was not as crisp as it could have been. The story line was great and the cinematography was outstanding. The editing though had a few scenes where it jumped to quick into another scene. Especially noted was the bedroom scene where Holmes was in the center of the bed. He makes a Holmes like comment and then we go directly to his flat I believe. Again just a small observation. This movie is a solid 4 stars.
B009YU62H2|4.0|It's been 16 years since the last proper studio release. I'm happy to report that it's not a disappointment. Is it everything I've hoped for in a Soundgarden album?  Well, yeah for the most part. Is it their best record? No. No one Soundgarden record is a home run right off the bat, with the exception being Superunkown which has all the studio polish and all the right hooks all over<br />the record. Like the 96' album Down On The Upside, is textured but not overly glossy from a production standpoint. The first 3 tracks sound like a natural progression from the last studio record - a sense of bizarre time signitures , no apologies power chord riffing, and signiture Cornell wailing. While cool, it's not really until track 4 &#34;A thousand days before&#34; and  5&#34;blood on the valley floor&#34; that showcase Thayill's bottom end guitar sound to the forefront- albiet covered in Beatle-esque psychedelic noodles, - let us not forget Shepard's often tasteful display of bass runs interplaying with Cameron's often busy playing. &#34;Bones of Birds&#34; and &#34;taree&#34; are the more subdued tracks on the record- and while tap into quieter dynamics - are more creepy than they are melancholic. (Although there's a bit of that) &#34;attritition&#34; is a bit more upbeat but reminds me a bit of a &#34;kickstand&#34; - stooges-esque kinda attitude rocker. Some tracks don't grab me instantly but rather require a few listens before they soke in- which is why I hestitate to get it a full 5 stars. Still, its an album explores alot of moods and textures - but never feels overly self important or too nasal gazing. Don't expect power ballads on this record- instead it's cerebral and head trippy. Not quite as heavy as Badmotorfinger but probably closer to Superunknown or Down On The Upside- not bad company if you ask me...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille's Witt comes through in full. This is a classic and one of his best. He weaves current events with his most memorable characters. An excellent read.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|As soon as I got my preorder from Amazon I put the dvd in and began to watch this amazing concert. It was as if all of the years were gone ok Jimmy's has gone grey but can he still play and Robert still has that voice as powerful as ever John Paul is amazing and then to have John's son filling in for him on drums what a tribute to his father. A great set list all of the greats are here spanning their entire time they were together. I prefer live albums over studio it shows how good the band is these guys deliver the goods in spades. Great group great show.
B004Y8075M|5.0|Jonas, a boy on the verge of becoming a twelve, lives in a society where everything seems perfect.  People feel no pain, everyone gets along, uniformity is celebrated, and everyone is happy to follow the society's norms.  However, Jonas is nearing a huge milestone in his life, which will shake his view of the world around him.<br /> As children in the society reach the age of twelve, they are assigned to the careers they will work in until they grow old.  Jonas's task, which is chosen by the community's Elders, is a very important and honorable position.  This task will send Jonas on a path that leads to self-discovery, self-awareness, and forces him challenge everything he has ever known.  Jonas sees his family, his friends, and his whole community differently.  He begins to question the Elders, the ways of the society, and what is right and wrong.  Events in the society leave Jonas with the biggest decision of his life, and he must choose to do what he believes is best for himself and the society.<br /> Lois Lowry depicts the dystopian society in great detail.  The work is written for teens, and Lowry definitely plays to that audience.  As a high school social studies teacher I think The Giver would be a great book to use in a sociology class.  It could be part of a more broad culture unit, and used to discuss social norms, variations from one culture to the next, and could also spark discussions about some controversial topics written in the book.  Lois Lowry's The Giver is an extremely well written and thought provoking work.  I would highly recommend this book to any teen or adult.  I cannot wait to read the rest of The Giver series.
1250007305|5.0|Excellent - I lost a lot of sleep reading it. And it was well worth it! I'm now reading Trojan Horse. I highly recommend both - but read Zero Day first.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|I remember reading this book as a young teen and it was delightful to go on the adventure with Rudyard Kipling again.  A great classic!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|too many repetive words. The theme is lame and the character Christian is too fiction.  It is a waste of time. I believe people read it out of curiousity.
0142000671|5.0|What more do you want? its a simple paper back book, looks good, decent enough cover, what else? its a book
B0000ADY9I|5.0|Bought it when it first came out, I think I drove my coworkers crazy while in Vietnam played it almost every night. I have both versions this one and the Fillmore Concerts both great both different nights from the other. It would be nice if like the Grateful Dead if they would release a box of the complete Fillmore run. I have a great recording od thr Allman Brothers at the Fillmore when they were playing with the Dead, the Grateful Dead recorded every show they played that is why there are so many of their shows available. That is incredible, it was released years ago on the Dead's lable try to find it. Now back to this one I think I have every solo burned into my memory. From the beginning notes of Statesboro Blues to Moutain Jam this album cooks all the way through. No doubt Daune was great but the rest of the band was right there with him and I'll tell you Greg just kills on that Hammond B3, he still does. I can't say enough about this album if it isn't a part of your collection you just are not seriuos about liking music. A zillions stars for this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is the best one I have had so far if you Sony have get this is my real opinion I love it.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|The movie keeps you interested the whole time, lots of very good scenes. Great actors, great story, great message. Don't miss this movie.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|This is the most over priced item I have ever ordered! With small children clamoring for any Minecraft items, I feel that as a<br />buyer I have been taken advantage of.  $115.00 for a 6x6 box of mini Legos is awful...It looks more like an $4.99 item.  This item will be returned.  I have better places to spend my hard earned dollars!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn never fails to keep you glued to his books until you finish and wish you'd taken your time, because now you have to wait for him to write/publish his next one.  The end of this book hopefully leads to the opening of the next one.  I just hope it doesn't take him long to get it to us!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A really fun game to play and enjoyable tension reliever.  Don;t forget to sometimes aim straight up to the sky!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn writes in a manner that always keeps me wondering. His description of characters and locations are outstanding. I hope he writes many more stories.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Enjoyed it. Typical Grisham style.<br />Drags a bit in the middle but exciting finish with a bit of a twist
B003G4W49C|5.0|Pleasantly surprised with this book. It's odd following a main character that is so young, but Orson Scott Card pulls it off so well. The beginning of a series, but this one is by far the best and can stand alone.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I watched this a couple of times just so I could make sure I did not miss any action, It was a good story line and lots of great action
B0086700CM|5.0|Both my 5 year old daughter and I are addicted to this fast-paced game. it's so much fun! Being chased by evil hungry monkeys adds a scathe level of excitement.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Im a 14 year old guy who plays all the modern shiz like skyrim and i actually enjoy this app... actually find it fun.. enough said
B008KW43TE|5.0|After waiting forever to purchase this cd i finally did it and I'm happy I did.  Great debut from Mr. Ocean.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I was disappointed in the shallow plot and the failure to develop the story line.  Frankly, it was also very short.<br />Probabaly not worth the money  Maybe the library will have other &#34;Heat&#34; books, as I will not purchase again.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|I couldn't figure out how they could make a movie of this book reading the first twenty chapters.  The author spent so much time creating the character of Pi that at first I thought I had the wrong book.  But then he and his family left for Canada and the fun began.  It is a wonderful read that clearly kept me involved and credulous.  Things seemed impossible yet I had to keep agreeing that you did what you had to do to survive.  All in all an entertainment to delight.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|This was a very dumb movie, I should have listened to the other ratings but figured I would give it a try.. oh well
1884883303|1.0|Unless you want to be aware of who the latest advertisers are do not buy this book.  Many of the pages I was interested in, such as Parker Guitars, are exactly the same as the 2009 issue.
B007SGM084|5.0|THE TRILOGY BUNDLE WAS WONDERFUL SINCE I COULD GO FROM ONE BOOK TO THE NEXT. WOULD LOVE TO BUY MORE BUNDLES AT YOUR EXCELLENT PRICE
0385341008|5.0|A great book.  I don't usually read books that take place outside the U.S. or before I was born, but I made an exception for this one when multiple people reccomended it.  I'm glad I read it!
0345803485|5.0|Enjoyed all the books. How can anyone read the first two books and not read the final of the trilogy?
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The gal who played snow white was terrible!  The best part of the movie was usually played by the queen, she did a great job!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This book had great pacing and was very fun. Only real complaint was that it was to short would love to see more of this magic used in other books.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|There is some good information here, even if I didn't like how excruciatingly looooong  it took to get to the point.
B001A78JPU|5.0|A very moving story. You won't want to put it down.  Don't be intimidated by the number of pages. It's worth it.
B004I11VZA|5.0|GREAT MOVIE !! ONE OF THE BEST FIGHTING SCENES EVER PRODUCED !!<br />A MUST FOR ALL BRUCE LEE FANS OUT THERE !!
B005ZUR724|5.0|I mean what can I really say. ITS AMAZING! You can have fun,fight,talk to people,get friends and have or be invited to a guild. Its great and it does kill time but hey who cares your having fun right?
B007EECSFA|3.0|Lots of time period changing back and forth.  Morton did a good job of developing some of the characters.  Very surprising ending.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series, and can hardly wait until the next season is available in the U.S. All the characters are so engaging and the story lines are great.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|:) Story telling at its best...! Cinematography to die for, acting spectacular, hope of seen the next chapter soon...! I HOPE...
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is one of the only shows that would actually make me pay to watch. I have never paid for a television show on Amazon or any other site in the past, but there was no way I could wait til this one came to Netflix. I look forward to watching every single week.
B00773YOB4|5.0|Not a filler cut on the entire album.  Each song is a gem. After her hiatus from recording, Bonnie simply shines.  Great vocal style as always!  Super musicianship and audio quality.  Keep on Bonnie!  Want to hear from you again soon.  If you are a Bonnie Raitt fan, this is a must.  Nobody like Bonnie.
031606792X|5.0|It was easy reading with a fantasy ploy but you really felt for the characters.<br />Great to bring on a vacation or enjoy on a Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />I never though I would enjoy this series, but it has a very special place in my heart now.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very entertaining,  The make-up and effects are fantastic.  This is one of the very few shows we watch that when it is over we can't wait for the next episode.  Keeps your attention for the entire show.  Everyone we know loves this show.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Ready for the next five movies in two yrs... :) Yes, I am wearing a Captain America T-Shirt as I write this... Ok, maybe not, but I did get one for my nephew a couple of days ago... :)
B007HACDLK|5.0|The action and intrigue is none stop.  All the familiar characters don't disappoint.  It's easy to hate the bad guys.  It's a page turner.  Can't wait for Flynn's next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book I could not put it down. It is my favorite book so far I am going to start reading the rest of the books now.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|What more is there to say about a USB power cable?  It allows you to connect to your USB port on your PC or home AC power outlet.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is one of my favorites!!  Never disappoints!!  Fast paced! This one kept me guessing almost to the very end.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I want More... I have read five books in a week after this book, trying to feel like I felt while I was readying it... No Luck, truth is the way I journeyed threw this book I had never felt before...! Thanks you, Thank you so much for this voyage you took me on... To remember my childhood in that way, was just awesome...!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always mr Flynn gives you a great read and you don't want to stop reading. Waiting for more from him and Mitch
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It is a very good action movie, like Expendables 1, don't expect more than that, just action and good actors.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really like this book..and the one before it in the series.  But I hate when someone puts out a 3 part book but only have the first two out ... you want to finish the series.
1455502758|4.0|I figured his thoughts on mortality as he was facing it would be quite interesting--and they were.  It was a good read.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I know going backwards. I started watching the show, long before reading the books, but I'm pleased that they reflect one another. Can't wait for the next season.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Really enjoyed learning not just what to do but why and how the body does what it does with certain foods and workouts going in dept exactly what's happening leaving the body building realm simplified and doable. Its a nice standpoint from someone who has tried most of what's out there and explains fully each aspect of food and workout then gives you researched data and tests from universities giving you more certainty. After reading the book I get that Mike really isn't hyping or pushing products but really just helping others from his experience and research by simplifying this over complicated world of body building.<br /><br />Great book. Great data. Thank you
6305754969|5.0|The Duke! I don't need to say more!  It's on TV a lot, but I still needed this for my own!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I found this game to be relatively easy and fun to play.  I plan to keep on playing as often as I can.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks knows how to write a good book. Has all the emotions you'll ever have in a book. Love this particular story out of all his books. Love knowing that one simple picture can carry someone through some really hard days even if you don't know that person
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I'm new to Kindle and didn't read all the reviews on this app...sure wish I did as it is terrible. It doesn't work. I cannot add any cities and it only shows Los Angeles on the screen, tries to load but never does.  It was only .49 for this app but I wasted my money on it.  Try the test drive if you are interested as that doesn't work either.  I have no idea how to contact Amazon about this problem.. maybe they will contact me after this bad review.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a superb author whose writing style makes you never want to put the book down. His latest Mitch Rapp novel is no exception. I've read them all and this rates right up there with the best!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This will be rated one of the best movies of all time. I find something new and amazing every time I watch it.
B002KGEORM|5.0|It was a great experience to be able to catch up on this amazing show from the beginning through instant video streaming! I would highly suggest this show and this feature for Prime members.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Fabulous writing. Riveting story line. This book was a recommendation, read it and it's second book and highly recommend it to anyone else.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|We rented this movie through Amazon and I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see this in a movie theatre.  I usually like a musical but this was rather hokey.  Not what we expected at all.  We did watch the whole movie but would not recommend it.
B0096PAA6E|1.0|After the Crossroads Live performance and various internet video clips I was really looking forward to the release of this album. Why had no one signed him up?<br /><br />He has got the chops and the voice coupled to the killer riffs and beat, but a lot of this is &#34;so so&#34; modern soul and pop without any real grit or emotion. I found myself hitting the next track button looking for the next &#34;Bright lights&#34; or &#34;Don't owe you a thang&#34; without success. Shame.....
1451695195|1.0|The first couple of chapters were interesting, but after he goes into his NDE, the book gets painfully boring. I couldn't finish it. A waste of money!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A fantastic book. An absolute must read. It draws you in, so you keep reading to find out where it goes and what happens
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Its Such a great book that,will,make u,repose the world around u. I love this book and so,will u<br /><br />Always read on
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|my son and husband love this game. They fight each other to play it and try to beat each others score.
B009X01C64|5.0|This is an excellent case for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".  It's really fantastic.<br /><br />This case provides great protection for your Kindle.  The cover protects the screen from scratches and the hard shell plastic holder protects it from minor impacts.  It's really a great way to protect the device.<br /><br />The quality of the leather (let's just call it leather, OK?) on the outside is really nice and resists stains and marking very well.  The inside suede (suede-ish) is very soft and gentle on the screen.  It's attractive and feels good when you hold it.<br /><br />The front cover flips back completely for when you're holding the Kindle in your hand.  The flap holding the cover on doesn't resist being folded back that way, and it closes back normally just fine when you close it.<br /><br />The swivel mechanism is fantastic.  It freely swivels the Kindle 360* (or even around and around) without any limitations.  This makes it possible to stand the Kindle up and use it hands-free in either portrait or landscape position. Two of the edges (one long edge and one short edge) have small plastic tongues that slip into the slot on the inside of the front cover.  Use this to stand the Kindle in one of the three slots to adjust the tilt.  This is great for reading or viewing videos--I wouldn't recommend using it for games or anything where you are swiping the screen a lot (or entering text).  For typing or swiping, it works better to hold the device in your hands or lay it flat on the tabletop.<br /><br />The only thing I wish this cover had is a little pocket for holding notes or hotel room keys.  That's a small complaint though.<br /><br />I love this cover and highly recommend it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Awesome read, and worth every penny.  Nobody does political / cia thrillers like Vince Flynn.  One of many great books.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|The entire series was fantastic. I couldn't put them down, but I did especially enjoy this last installment. Highly reccommend.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is okay but the constant ads are a real distraction - not to mention a drag on the battery.  Of course the price is great!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game! Love the theme! The game is easy to navigate and the graphics are great. The game follows the story too. Beware though, it restarted on me and I lost everything.
B0087EACJK|5.0|I loved the original web-based Continuity game, but it's a Flash game and it can't be played on Mobile devices that don't support Flash. Continuity 2 is a great enhancement to the original. In addition to the physics rules from the original, they added the ability to rotate the tablet and have your player character fall and tumble to different axes. So by rotating the Kindle 90* the walls become the floor and your character falls to the new ground.<br /><br />The UI is very clean and looks great on the Fire HD. The mechanics and controls work great on this tablet. This is one of the first games I've played on the Fire in a long time where I didn't feel like the designer had taken shortcuts or made compromises. This really is a big improvement over the original Flash game. Well done!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|What is the point of this story? Got tedious and there was only one or two times that the story became interesting. I can see why James Cameron likes this one - usual pablum. I'm going to skip the movie, too.
030758836X|5.0|It came on time, and it was good quality. I appreciate the punctuality and the quality. I repeat this over and over because I was really pleased.
B000MV9026|5.0|When my granson (he's almost 3) and I watched this DVD he actually began dancing like the seal. That alone was worth buying the DVD. I've had more fun with this movie and with him &#34;showing Ga'ma&#34; his Happy Feet. Sometimes he actually does it spontaneously when he's happy and so do I.
B00979CS50|5.0|What I expected.
1419705849|5.0|This is the seventh book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  Do things finally go right for everyone's favorite wimp, Greg Heffley?  Of course not.  It wouldn't be as funny if Greg's plans worked out the way he wanted, would it?  This \\"diary\\" covers January and February, with the most notable event being the Valentines Dance.  I don't want to give away what happens, but trust me, it's funny.  I'm a former wimpy kid, I know what I'm talking about.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|I have had no luck with getting this game running. It says it is downloading resources, however it is doing absolutely nothing! I have full WIFI signal, so that is not the problem. I will not be purchasing anymore games from this faulty game maker! Grrrr
B004TI5N38|5.0|Can't wait for the next one.  Looking forward to learning more about the characters and there backgrounds.  Keep it up.
B005603236|5.0|Although lesser known of Jane Austen's novels, the screen adaptation of Northanger Abbey is wonderful and the blu-ray quality is quite good, with more details visible compared to the regular dvd.
B000P0J024|5.0|What I expected.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|A story about the importance of the environment, Dr. Seuss' original story was years ahead of its time. This movie brings it into the current time, and almost ahead of it. Environmentalism is a big topic of discussion now, more than it was when the story was first written, and this movie is a very real reminder of what could happen if we ignore things for too long.<br /><br />&#34;Dr. Suess' The Lorax&#34; tells the story of a boy named Ted who, acting on the words of his Grammy Norma, travels from his home in Thneedville to find the Once-ler. With a little persuasion, the Once-ler begins to tell the story of why the Truffula forest no longer exists and who is to blame for it.<br /><br />Several big-name celebrities lend their voices to roles, including Zac Efron as Ted, Taylor Swift as Audrey (Ted's love interest), Betty White as Grammy Norma, and Danny DeVito as the Lorax himself. Unfortunately, Zac Efron and Taylor Swift have no songs of their own. I found some of the acting to be a little wooden at times, but overall it was pretty good.<br /><br />The animation is wonderful. The bright colors of Thneedville and the forest before the Once-ler arrived contrast greatly with the state of the forest in Ted's time. The animators truly brought life and character to the the Bar-ba-loots, Swomee-Swans, and Humming-Fish that made their home among the Truffula trees. Unlike the original story, the Once-ler is given a face, which allows the audience to connect with him a bit more than if he was simply a pair of arms. He also has the distinct personality of someone who is determined to make it big and isn't willing to let things get in his way. In the end, he digs his own grave by destroying the entire Truffula forest.<br /><br />The music is very upbeat and is meant to appeal to the younger audience. Personally, I found the musical numbers somewhat painful to listen to. I didn't feel that they were that well done, although they did immediately get stuck in my head.<br /><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie. The personality of the characters and the animation more than made up for the failure of the musical numbers. It's appropriate for all ages, and although younger children will probably enjoy it more, there is humor in it that adults will appreciate. This DVD actually also includes a few special features (despite the fact the the listing says it does not). It includes a very short documentary about the designing of the movie, a few character drawing lessons from story artist Mark O'Hare, an interactive experience, and commentary from the director and co-director.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|It is a good app my 2yr. old daughter loves it and she will play it all day long. For a FREE app it is worth the down load.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Keep the Mitch Rapp books coming.  This was a fast and enjoyable novel.  I recommend it to any fiction buff.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is actually an ITV production and not BBC - a common mistake made by many American viewers.  As written on the detailed description of Season 3 - Original UK edition (blu-ray & dvd) on the 'Shop' section of the PBS website (pbs.org), this does include the 9th / Final episode to be shown in UK during Christmas.  So, the assumption that only the US edition dvd of Season 3 will include the Christmas special, is incorrect.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|Having only heard one song off the album before, I wasn't really knowing what to expect when I bought this album. I was pleasantly surprised though, and absolutely LOVE it! His voice in amazing and the songs are so catchy and fun. I can't stop listening or get these songs out of my head. HUGELY reccommend!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a good app but not the worst either.I don't like the ipod version gshvdtg gfthv ergcfgc cfyvdg fjcfhb fubcfg dyhvfh
0679731725|3.0|I was waiting for what i thought were to happen but the main character just throws away the oppourtunity! It is also a confusing book to follow so it was very unappealing to me. I only read it cause i had to for my english class.
B0001MDQ6W|5.0|True music will never fade. This is one of the greatest live performances ever.<br />You'll love it!<br />Very VERY recommended
B0090NNQX6|5.0|It is rare for me to listen to a full cd by any given artist.  This cd is one of the few exceptions.  Every track a listening pleasure.
B001QXCYZY|2.0|It did not receive phantom power through the USB like it said it would. I had to return it back and get a one that does!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I loved this app when I first got it but now it keeps freezing on me and force closing. I dont even know why. It doesnt need an update so not sure what to do.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Play it when I am bored.It's intertaining.This game has a good challenge too.I can play this any where.I can't use other things.
B0037XPP84|5.0|Cate Blanchett is one of our best actors in the field, and once again, she brings forth an amazing performance in this movie.  It is as good as the prequel, Elizabeth.  I highly recommend this for the writing, acting and staging.
1905236042|4.0|it's a bit easier to follow if you have a little yoga experience, but these cards do a great job of illustrating both the pose and the idea behind it (relaxing, stretching, centering, etc.).  Don't expect an energetic 3 y.o. boy to do the meditating ones though...
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the best book of the series thus far.  Edge of your seat excitement.  The pages just fly by.  I read the whole thing in one week, which is crazy fast for a busy, working mom.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Reading the Bible is so much easier if you have a plan to guide you through what to read. This Bible is loaded with daily reading plans. The only drawback is you need an Internet connection but that only causes a few problems!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love to here music most of the time and this station is great.I like the oldies and the Beatles music.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is addicting, and the fun doesn't end. Though it's free, you can buy things in the game. If you like dragons, you'll like Dragonvale!

B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy playing this!
0393064476|5.0|This is one of those rare non-fiction books that manages to touch on the mystical by making ancient voices and abstract concepts accessible to the lay reader, while at the same time keeping its roots very firmly in reality. The voices of monks, popes, and Greek philosophers are explained and tangible to the present-day reader. Can't recommend highly enough.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I finished it in two nights. I could not put it down.  Would recommend to anyone
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones was recommend by a friend I read book one and now I am reading book two so I downloaded the first episode it was great .
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It is fun but very frustrating and it helps with the cordination. I would recommend it to anyone that likes to work out frustrations.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The first season of the Game of Thrones in Blu-ray was truly incredible. Although it obviously did not cover every aspect of the book, it did a terrific job of staying with the multiple story-lines and character development. Also, the location shoots looked time period authentic and the movie technology was crazy good.
B002H6ZQRM|5.0|We LOVEd this movie! So much so that we had to own it so we can watch it anytime we want.
0345529057|3.0|Reading the first two books was a great pleasure. As a fan of Tolkien's works, I felt that A Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings were like Tolkien-esque books written for modern audiences used to more risque and violent content. Best of all, they were fun and engaging with interesting characters and decent pacing. Lots of important things happened in the first two books that kept you turning pages. Then something awful happened with books 3 and 4. They lost focus and lost my interest. They got boring with too many pages devoted to characters I either didn't know or didn't care about. Occasionally there would be tidbits of intriguing content but they seemed to be few and far between, especially in Feast For Crows. It got so boring that I had to resort to listening to that book on CD. Even that was difficult. I can only hope that it gets better from here because it would be painful to imagine the series getting worse. There was so much potential.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I read a preview of this book while on a flight to Michigan. The story tweaked my interest even though it's not my normal preference in reading.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A different and very interesting story about life.  Good food for thought. Written by physician with strong knowledge of material.
B0030B624E|5.0|Yep, another Zombie movie! But seriously! Worth the watch! If you have time to search for another silly zombie movie look up Aaaah! Zombies! You'll Die Laughing!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|It's sort of like a first person angry birds type game but has a charm all its own. I played it from beginning to end and had a great time along the way. This game was hard to stop playing. Just wish it had more levels. Terrific FAOTD.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|&#34;It's so fluffy I'm gonna to die!&#34;<br />This is a sweet and funny movie. I'm glad I finally own it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I think the box office numbers speaks on how well this movie was put together.  Why not bring the action home in 3D.
B004X75RK4|4.0|I giggle snorted so many times while watching this movie! LOL So silly! Sandra Bullock is always entertaining and definitely brought it for this movie! Loved it!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Riptide GP is a professionally made 3D racing game with excellent graphics, sound, and controls. I like that it's on water instead of land. I think it has great replay value, and it's easy to just pick up and play for brief bursts. Best of all, it's fun for all ages.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love this movie! It is funny and action packed. I love watching it. Just watched it again last week with my parents...who also loved it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved it bi will always encourage people to read this defenitly I could. Never stop reading in class it was addictive
B000VHIWD4|5.0|Have owned these on vinyl ,cd and now by download. Each purchased 15 years apart. the MP3 is clearer. Realizing the new recordings are getting rave review, I will still defer to these, there is just something here which makes a tear come to my eye.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched it while it was on the air...but always wondered &#34;What is that? Looks interesting&#34;. Then I watched a friend's DVD of it and LOVED it! Can't believe it only had 1 season. I must have it!
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|love this app because it plays all of my downloaded music and gives me much more music settings and options to choose from as opposed to the standard Kindle Fire music player.
B0086700CM|5.0|A really fun, addictive game that is easy and difficult at the same time.  My 7 year old convinced me to download this game after playing it at a friends house and I'm hooked!  A great game for coordination skills as well as to just pass some time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I started reading this book because I was curious about the background for Spielberg's movie. I was pleased to find out that Doris Kearns Goodwin had written the book. She has done great research in her approach to Lincoln. This book gives insight to Lincoln that is lacking in many accounts of his life by examining other major figures of his time. DKG has certainly done her homework, and it is very readable. If you like personal historical biographies, this is a must read. Great background on events leading to the Civil war although not the depth that she gives on Lincoln. This is not a criticism, rather I'm trying to say that even if you've forgotten events leading to the war, she brings you up to speed. This book is for the amateur historian as well as the the serious. I started learning things I didn't know from the beginning and kept stopping to tell my husband or daughter new tidbits that I didn't know before. And I read some of Lincoln's stories aloud to my family. I used to teach Early American History which is all about the events leading to the Civil War. I've also read her book about LBJ for a topical study course for my master's degree and found it to be very insightful as well.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This was such a fun game.  Now it crashes whenever I try to do anything.  Made it to level 69.  All my crops are ready to harvest and all my buildings have money to collect.  Have full energy and I am unable to do anything.
B008FC4WA4|4.0|I do like Nick Hornby's older books - and this Kindle Single is like a return to Nick's first author years. It reads well, it's funny and witty and you will be truly sorry for the poor guy who is the main character:-) I liked this story a lot and can recommend it.
B007HACDLK|3.0|This is not up to Vince Flynn's usual standard.  If this had been the first Vince Flynn novel that I read, I don't think that I would have read any others.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This was an Ok movie some good action scenes, I watch it twice and still seemed to notice that this movie was not aligning with the Alien saga.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is a great read and a regretfully the end of a nicely crafted tale.  Can't wait for the remaining movies to be released so I can enjoy the books one more time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've been a fan of Riordan's mythology novels for awhile now, and he never ceases to amaze. The book picks up right where Son of Neptune left off, with the Greeks and Romans forced to join forces to save the world from Gaia and her giant children. Characters from Percy Jackson and the Olympians unite with Riordan's new heroes to form a powerful, dysfunctional, and hilarious team. With their quest taking them all the way to Rome itself, the heroes face down ancient monsters and powerful enemies, all while struggling to piece together how to save the world. This novel gives the reader their first glimpse into the mind of Annabeth and her own mission. With lively humor, constant action, and a climactic ending, this is one book fans don't want to miss.
B008SVFX96|4.0|Absolutely a departure from the Bon Jovi like material, but the same can be said for his prior two releases as well.<br />One can tell that his vocals are enhanced and altered in a number of the heavier/faster paced tracks, which makes it seem like some one other than Sambora is on vocals.<br /><br />But none the less, it is a nice/different listen
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I was so thrilled with Book 1 (A Game of Thrones) that I powered through the next two books within a couple of weeks. A Storm of Sword is equal, if not better, than #1 -- and, btw, #2 is also quite good, if somewhat more plodding.  After a couple thousand pages of time investment, which was rewarding enough, I feel like A Storm of Swords is a good place to stop.<br />ASOS has all the great twists, turns and ruthless fates of its predecessors, but there's a sense that forward thrust is starting to slow.  For #4 and #5, I'm switching to book summaries.<br />I might pick up the series gain when #6 comes out, assuming/hoping reviews indicate it offers progress and resolution on the handful of characters about which I care.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Truly fiction not at it's finest, it's just ok (lower case).  The author's note at the end of the book sums it up best.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I bought for my 11 month old and he really likes it. He hates to be restrained so it's a real challenge to keep him in anything with seatbelts eg. highchair,  carseat, stroller. But he seems not to mind this bike seat. We had it for about 4 months and he still likes the rides. It takes a little practice to ride with the seat and a baby but I find it relatively easy and comfortable.... as for the baby - he seems to be comfortable too since he falls asleep 9 out of 10 times.
B007N0REX6|3.0|Not the best of albums, but it is definently a nice listen from his previous album where you may of heard &#34;fergie, among others on vocals.....<br />Myles Kennedy on vocals knocks it outta the park, sounds alot like Axl in alot of regards...<br />But this is not a masterpiece by no means... making me wish he wasn't churning out music every year and took more time to cook up some more great riffs.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book grabs your attention and interest from the first page to the last.  Vince Flynn is a master story teller and his stories are exciting and the time frame for the story is the one we are living in right now.  If you are fan of Mitch Rapp as I am you will like this book a lot!!!
B000SEGTI0|4.0|I love Bladerunner and have seen all versions.  I was curious to read the book that inspired it.  There are very substantial and interesting differences between the book and Bladerunner.  I enjoyed both.
B005LAII8A|5.0|I really was. I won't get into the story and stuff as many other users have previously done so but This film is just so damn good. If its not a Cult Classic within a year or so i will be very disappointed. See this now. Don't wait.
B005I6EU7U|2.0|This is a beautiful cover. However, the case doesn't close no matter how much adjusting you do with the Fire. I am extremely disappointed in Verso because I can't keep the case if it doesn't fit and I really love how it looks.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I think that this book was great because it was funny.<br />My favorite part of the book was when Greg went to a restaurant and got lost in a maze.
B002NT3B52|2.0|I read a newspaper article about the book and the author, so I gave it a try.  It is really very superficial.
B004KWVDWI|5.0|Papillon is one of my favorite prison escape movies of all time, because it combines so many classic elements in a single film:  a glaring expos&eacute; of the cruelty inflicted on inmates of the now-defunct penal system in French Guyana; compelling performances by a fantastic cast, led by McQueen and Hoffman, and amazing locations/cinematography.  The grit, courage and determination demonstrated by Papillon through many years of incarceration and torment, in the worst conceivable conditions, is a real testament to the triumph of the human spirit ... one which never fails to give me a lift when I watch the film.<br /><br />As a long-time fan of the film, I waited a VERY long time to get my own copy of it, and I wanted that copy to be the last one I'd ever need.  When the Blu-Ray first came out, it was a bit too expensive, but now, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to wait any longer.  In terms of price and quality, it's never going to get any better than this.  Both the picture and sound quality of this Blu-Ray version are first-rate.  The disc holder is placed at the back of a little hard-bound book, with some great, crisp photos and lots of background information on the film.  To me, the book is a bonus.  I would have gladly paid $20 for the Blu-Ray alone.  I consider this package the definitive version of \\"Papillon\\" for my personal library of favorite films, and could not be more pleased.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Very vivid imagination. Truly love old English writing. Would recommend to anyone.  Felt privileged to have read this literary classic.
B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|I have wanted to purchase for several years.  I have no added to my collection.  Thanks for great service.  Quality movie for family enjoyment.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is an old favorite and it has been interesting seeing different versions over the years.  I think the first recording of it I watched was one of those 12 inch laser discs.  For an enthusiast of the film, the Collector's Edition is like a playground.  I am not usually very enthused by those &#34;Making of ...&#34; shorts.  The supplements in this collection, however, were fascinating.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|I watched this with my kids who, after reading the book, absolutley had to see the movie.  There are some adult themes, but let's be honest here, it a movie about a kid who talks to ghosts and fights zombies.  If you don't want your kids to see those things, then this is not the movie for you whether or not it has &#34;Adult&#34; themed jokes.  I actually rather enjoyed it, as I did the book.  (Yes, I read it before they did, but it was purely just to see if it would be appropriate for teenage boys.  ;))  All in all, Funny movie with a great slew of characters.
1451678193|5.0|I bought this as a required novel for a class. The book arrived quickly and its condition was perfect. However, I am still NOT a fan of science fiction! For those who are, I guess this is a classic ... whatever!

0547995660|4.0|Strong beginning. A lot of thought went into the world creation. A few dark points surprising in a children's book. Its society mocks families by replacing it with a pale imitation. Interesting. The ending feels rushed. The final ending is open ended, but that doesn't bother me.
0062124293|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud so many times. Highly recommended for anybody who is looking for an extremely funny, blatantly honest, and insightful read.

0547884591|5.0|I have read all of Tim's books and follow his blog and think he should run for President in 2016! Let me explain... Tim is a renaissance man and has the ability to master subject areas and unite people behind a cause. More so than what most scholars or experts will do, Tim throws himself literally into the situation and comes out with the most favorable outcome. With that being said, if Tim were to decide now to pursue the Presidency, there is no doubt he would master economics, foreign policy, etc and be more \\"prepared\\" than most professional debaters (I mean politicians). Tim is a one man Wikipedia, he picks his expert sources and aggregates all of the useful data just for us. Thank you Tim! The 4 Hour Chef is just a continuation of his never-ending quest to what works best! Do yourself a favor and pick up the hardback version of this book. You will see what I mean, the book will not only short cut you to success it will also amaze you with how beautiful it is. I don't know how else to put it. Well researched content systematically presented in vivid pictures with beautiful layout and typography. It truly is a work of art in the modern sense of the word. Tim for President... You won't!!!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|From the title of 'No Plan B' (which is a great title) through all of the cuts on the CD, Van Morrison proves again why he is one of the &#34;Living Legends&#34; of our musical history and this CD is a must buy for those who appreciate the artist. As a side note: I was fortunate to have recently purchased a new copy of a previously released, but limited, CD of 'Van Morrison - Live at Austin City Limits' and that two CD set has become my favorite of all. If you are able to find a copy, and appreciate great music by a &#34;Living Legend&#34; my recommendation would be to buy it !!
B00081U7HC|3.0|I bought this movie for my sis in law because when this movie came out we watched it together until we had all the lines memorized.  When I pulled the package out of the mailbox it rattled.  Turns out the movie is ok, but the holder part for the center of the DVD was broke and everything was just floating around in the box.  Not real happy about that, but it will do.

B0091LS07E|4.0|Having been an AK fan from day one and owning all her previous work, I purchased this album without sampling any of it and is totally happy with it. It is Alicia and she has matured and it shows in her songs. The production is great, the lyrics are strong and powerful. I had listened to this album twice before I had even realized it repeated. My only upset is not having Girl On Fire without the dreadful Nicki Minaj feature. I erased both off of my ipod and laptop and now I have to buy the single without the feature, I feel like the feature version should have been on a deluxe version, other than that I am very happy with this album and believes that Alicia will continue to be a force in the R&B world.<br /><br />A fav is the oddly produced \\"When its all over\\", \\"Fire we make\\" and \\"Not even the king\\" she has an overall amazing album but these are my favorite thus far.

B004UID2LC|4.0|App works well.  I like it a lot.  However you can get the same app in the play store for free.  This should be an add free app, because I paid for it.  I am still looking for a better app,  because I don't like that it has an add banner.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This was another good read with surprising twists, multiple story lines, and complex characters.  I'm usually not surprised by an ending but this one got me!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read in a long time.  It is a story of a young man's journey of self-discovery while trying to fit in to a high school setting...a bildungsroman novel that is very well written!!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|So I thought this movie was going to be kinda cheesy.  It actually turned out to be an awesome movie.  My boyfriend is very picky about movies, and he actually liked it as well.  May I say, Johnny Depp is very good looking as well.  Awesome movie, I was very happy with my purchase.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great replacement or spare. I would recommend to anyone who needs a replacement or spare cord. It's made life easier now that I have a spare cord again.
0345803485|5.0|Loved it, don't know what else to say, I was riveted from start to finish, could not put it down until the trilogy ended.
B009DB60W4|5.0|The lastest album from Therion is probably their best produced and mixed album ever.The vocals are stunning and instrument work has the best tone and sound from the band since Sirius B/Lemuria.The main difference is the content of the album lyrics.Instead of the World of Myths,Occult and Esoteric,we get a collection of French pop and love songs from a few decades ago.So is it a \\"Therion\\" album?The answer is yes!The songs all have the Therion treatment and just as any Therion album their will those people who totally get into it(in this case finding out what the lyrics are ,if they don't know French) and those who just enjoy the music itself and not ever care what the lyrics are.Isn't this ever Therion album?And for me there is no more mysterious and occult than love itself (I certainly don't understand it!) and at least the songs deliver a sense of joy and sadness (without knowing any French at all) than a standard Justine Bieber piece of crap.So if Therion wants to \\"break the rules of metal\\" and do an album like this more power to them.  As for the songs \\"Poup&eacute;e De Cire, Poup&eacute;e De Son \\" is a great album kick off up tempo song,\\" Initials B.B. \\" is a very close example of what a Therion song of the current time would be most familar to fans.\\"Soer Ang&eacute;lique\\" is my favorite (a wall of sound Sixties type song with Therion treatment) and \\"En Alabama\\" is a great example of a song that uses the beauty of the language to express a feeling.The whole album is strong from start to finish if you give it a few listens.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie was awesome!  Even though Kristen Stewart is in it, and can't act to save her life, other characters make up for this serious lacking.  Chris Hemsworth was fantastic as always, although perhaps a little more skin would have been appropriate.  Very interesting take on Snow White, and I was a fan.

B0093LFENA|3.0|Robbie Williams really wants you to like his new album, one can tell when listening. The optimistic album title says it all; he's here to reclaim what (in his mind) is rightfully his: the crown as King of Pop Music. Whether he succeeds is a matter of opinion (and probably geography).<br /><br />With two hit singles already in Europe, it's \\"so-far, so good\\" for 'Take the Crown', a pleasantly-bubbly entry in Rob's recorded output.  The record is well-produced (by Jacknife Lee) and sounds polished, confident, and stadium-ready. And yet, it has become clear that Robbie really has no identifiable music style anymore, but rather is entirely dependent on outside producers to create a style for him (perhaps he always was; but at least the Guy Chambers albums had a consistent style). This time out, it's slick synth-based power ballads and chiming guitars, and a trailer single (\\"Candy\\") by Gary Barlow, which is catchy and fun but really could have been sung by any pop idol.<br /><br />On a few of the outstanding tracks (Gospel, Into the Silence, even his halting demo version of Take That's \\"Eight Letters\\"), Robbie does sound more engaged with the music than on his other recent albums. The duet with American folk singer Lissie (\\"Losers\\") sounds more real than anything else on the album; at first one may think this is a possible future direction for him, but mostly likely it is a one-off experiment.<br /><br />Which brings us to the biggest problem with Robbie's music these days; ever since his break with Guy Chambers, he has experimented with various sounds and multiple producers, but really hasn't produced anything approaching the classic status of his Chambers output, and he hasn't even stuck with one set of songwriters or producers from one album to the next. Is he in search of the next \\"Angels\\", or simply adrift in a sea of both suffocating superstardom and artistic apathy?<br /><br />This immaculate pop album will no doubt find many buyers, and should continue the success of his comeback efforts after the disaster that was 'Rudebox'. However as for the elusive \\"crown\\" of pop music, that remains up for grabs.of his comeback efforts after the disaster that was 'Rudebox'.

B006G7R2KW|2.0|This season 4 is trash, horrible writing. Pathetic at best, season 4 becomes predictable. Characters are skewed to keep idiots watching, I'd be really interested to see who wrote seasons 4. GL End your SOA at 3. As it should have been.

B00913P6G0|5.0|I have been listening to rap for over 2 decades now and this dude spits lyrics. All these wack ass rappers that talk about money cars and bitches can eat a D*#K. I am so sick of studio rappers which all sound the same 2 Chainz/ Big Sean and so on.<br />Kendrick and J. Cole are some of the best new artists to come out in years. I have not heard a bad mix tape or album from either of them. Heard they are teaming up for a joint effort, i am sure it will be dope.

B006OE7XM4|5.0|Gregory Porter has what many jazz vocal pretenders can't manufacture! The jazz &#34;gene&#34;. He has that warm mahogany voice and knows how to use it. He composes original songs and boy do they work! &#34; On My Way To Harlem&#34; is the most infectious song I've heard in a decade: I can't get it out of my head! And it's not the only great song on the disc: &#34;Painted On Canvas&#34; and &#34;Be good&#34; are also wonderful. There hasn't been a male jazz stylist to excite me this much in many years; I can only hope to see him live some day.
B004D2A04M|4.0|This should come with the flashlight instead of the cloth pouch it comes with. It rotates on your belt so you can use it hands free if you want. I wear it everyday for work and it retains the flashlight perfectly. I run climb and go through alot of brush and it stays in place. The flashlight comes out with just one hand no hang ups. I've had it about a month and it's great. The combat grip of the flashlight shredded the old pouch and made it difficult to get the flashlight out. I highly recommend this holster. It will fit almost any small handheld flashlight.
B009DMIZM6|5.0|Showed it to my 2 and 4 year old.  We were doing Kung Fu for days afterward.  The kids identified with the characters and the story line was enjoyable for adults as well as kids.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is very addicting. I love it !!! If you haven't seen this show you are missing out. Watch the series from the beginning though and you will be amazed how addicting it is........
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Hysterical vs. historical. Learn the real story about a real hero. Who knew Mary Todd was so hot? Now I know what really happened to Will. Support your local library!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|A must read for all, irrespective of leaning or beliefs! There's so much I've learnt as I went thru each page. You have to have an open mind though!
B003521R6G|5.0|THE ONE, THE ONLY, THE BEST!<br />One of the best of all the 80's classics and my personal favorites!!!<br />There can be remakes a plenty but they will never be as good as this...IMHO.<br />Thanks!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book exciting !! The third one should hopefully be a little more exciting than the last one I read
0312340958|4.0|I like memoirs and especially re:  this subject  Karen is remarkable to have survived.  My book club is very interested in it.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I love being able to sync my passwords across browsers and devices.  The secure password generator is a nice touch.  Generate a random string password and then save it so you won't have to remember it.  Very nice.  I have been using Lastpass in the form of browser add-ons for several years.  The Android app is what made me upgrade to a premium account.
0802473156|4.0|It's a good book and a good learning tool .Some of it states the obvious but like starting a new job one has to learn from the begining ...as with relationships sometimes we have to go back to the basics and learn from that ...
B0086700CM|4.0|Its a nice game and love to play it every time. Also the sudden changes makes more interesting all time
B007HACDLK|5.0|I wish I could give John Boehner a Mitch Rapp transplant of spine. I am only 30% through this lates Vince Flynn work and all I can say is I can't wait to get to the airport, get checked in, and settle in for some fantastic reading of a great book with characters that are eerily like those in the Benghazi debacle now. It is good to read a book about guys with spine, after dealing with this Administration and it's mealy-mouthed lying types all through the election cycle. I will review it fully after I am done, but for now, you can't go wrong getting this book. It's great from page 1
B00A11AN6O|2.0|Liked the Idea of having 5GB free storage (dropbox only 2GB free) but the app is not available for my BB Torch (mobile device) so it is not compatible for my needs.<br /><br />So many of these apps advertise across the board compatibility but they are not.<br /><br />The kindle fire has such limited space available for app storage that you can not afford to have apps that are so limited in function.<br /><br />I really enjoy my kindle fire except for all the hassle of hooking up the computer to transfer everything.  It would have been much easier if they would have installed an SD drive.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I choose this rating because I love this book just like the other series he wrote . Thank you Rick Riordan .
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|Oh boy! Talk about action. Talk about drama. This is the first of a trilogy, and what a begging. I own all 3, and this one sets the stage, and then some. Believe it or not, there even seems to be some correlation of Biblical proportions.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its a fun game that requires skill as well as mental patience. my kind of game!! i definitely recommend this game as a good time passer and a boredom killer!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|They really upped the ante on the action. If you are expecting a Woody Allen film, get lost. This is a film that harkens back to the classics of the 80's.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I choose this rating because I love this book just like all of the other books he wrote. Thank you Rick Riordan .
B0000VCZKW|5.0|We rented this for my daughter in 1996, when it was new. She watched it over and over and over and over. Every time I hear the theme song, \\"Little Bitty Pretty One,\\"  I think of her. The movie is fun, so I bought 2 copies, 1 for her and 1 for me. It is a cute story with the happiest of endings.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|when ever I want to save a photo someone tweeted it does not let me! it used to let me like a couple of days ago. the little button at the bottom let me. but now when I'm on a photo and click the button the only option it to bring me to my timeline. I need help!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|Running on on a D40 and it's been heavily used in direct, bounce, and with the clip-on diffuser.  I do a lot of macro work with it with the flash off camera using the SC-28 cable and the diffuser.  Works very well.<br /><br />For longer distances (say a school play it could use a little more power, but it is a great improvement over the built-in camera flash.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it that's all I can say!! Reminds me a lot of 50 shades!! Can't wait may 2013 and hopefully a 4th book :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I always enjoy John Grisham novels and this one doesn't disappoint. It's very complicated and keeps you wondering what the heck is going on. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a book that keeps you guessing about what will happen next.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|thank goodness these guys are on our side!  great peek inside the lives of SEALS, and fascinating read on the killing of UBL.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|I don't usually write a review...I leave that to the experts. But one movie gives me great joy during the Christmas season, and that is this movie, The Muppet Christmas Carol. I have always been a fan of the muppets and who better to give a whimsical treatmentn of a classic. But the best part of this film is Michael Cane. He plays it so straight. He spends most of the movie talking to sock puppets, yet you would not see that on his face or hear it in his voice. He takes the roll so seriously you would think he was doing it with a fine acting troup. If you could edit the muppets out, you would think you were watching a straight production of Charles Dickens'. Unfortunately, the song by Scrooges fiance is still not included, but the blu ray makes the film that much better. I highly recommend this film for anyone wishing to get into the Christmas spirit. It's funny and heart breaking all in one film. So pop it into your blu ray player and enjoy the evening with this fine Christmas delight.
B007ZCOT6C|5.0|I liked the differences between the worlds Alex and Brittany live in, loved their sarcastic banter (aka foreplay). And how Alex's character developed later on in his chapters. I mostly liked brittney when she actually stood up for herself in the beginning I wasn't too impressed with her, mainly her staying with a guy who just wanted one thing, because then her life wouldn't be 'perfect'.<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars even though I had to have a tiny rant. But over all I am in love this book and the series. And hey I'm learning Spanish and yes I did have google translate app open while I was reading these books
B005LAIHPY|5.0|When I first rented this movie I expected to see action and special effects from it and it delivered in spades!
B0053O89JM|5.0|Yet another awesome season of House, although I do miss Cuddy and 13. Can't believe Taub has two babies the same age by different women, although I guess it shouldn't come as a surprise. lol
0739378341|5.0|I haven't read this yet, but my husband read it on our last cruise.  He enjoyed it very much.  I intend to read it after the holidays.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever, love the story, the actor and actoress, and the music.<br />I've been a customer of Amazon for over 5 years now and I'm very please with their services.  I like Amazon to know this and thank all of the staff at Amazon for a job well done.  Please keep up the good work, it is the reason why I've been a prime member for so long.<br /><br />Merry Christmas and a Great New Year to all
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This was a very good and well made movie that seems to have been over edited to cut time.  If this was the three hour movie it seems it should have been it would have been a classic.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I bought the Kindle cover thinking it would fit my Kindle Fire HD. I was wrong so I gave it to my friend who has a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Roger
B005NQ94KS|1.0|Hathaway's last film before trading a womanly figure for a scarecrow's.  Years of being a shoulder to cry upon about Lost Dreams.  Finally getting together before being Torn Apart. A crying baby who becomes a beautiful daughter who understands he had a Lost Love.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I had to wait 2 years to get this from the movie release but, it was definitely worth the wait. It follows the original show if not exactly, at least accurately. Also, it was definitely not an American movie or even a made for America movie but, in this case, that was a good thing. Anyone who enjoyed the Star Blazers show back when they were a kid, do not even think about, just buy it. The English subtitles were very easy to follow as well and did not distract from the movie whatsoever.<br /><br />One thing I did notice right away, there were no movie previews or other crap that I had to skip through. (I really appreciated that.)
B008EQIEWS|4.0|This is a fun &#34;popcorn&#34; movie with good action and special effects, which my family enjoyed watching as much as the original Clash of the Titans.
B009GESJH2|3.0|A little better than Born free but this album is still pretty weak overall.  There are 3 or 4 great songs and then the rest if filler.  Boring ole filler.  This is a typical today's generation album.  Download a few tracks and never realize the rest happened.  Also, there is nothing that really rocks here.  There are signs of rocking on Let's Ride but it really a safe song.The others I like are The Mirror, Happy New Year and Chickens in the Pen which aren't exactly rocking Old School Kid Rock.  Sigh.  I miss the Rock N Roll Jesus and American Badass.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Ian Rankin has slowly built-up the suspense, introducing the characters so that, for first time Rankin readers, like me, I was able to fit them in as the plot progressed. Rebus is an unlikely, but likeable character.<br /> Rankin knows his Scottish countryside, so the reader becomes familiar with landmarks and routes.<br />Any reader of crime fiction will enjoy the style and suspense.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this book! It has gotten her so excited to go potty, I love pretty much all books by this author.  They are great for the almost 2 set.  The positive viewpoint really makes this book special.  My daughter especially likes the last page and will occasionally shout &#34;UNDIES!&#34; just for fun.
B009S8PEHY|3.0|I don't believe Rod Stewart's voice is made for Christmas carols.  This will not be a classic Christmas album.  It's just OK.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|There are some really great songs on here, Oh Yeah, Beautiful, Another Last Goodbye, Out go the Lights for example.  But, there is quite a bit of filler or generic songs that you will find yourself skipping over.  Maybe this should have been a 10 track album with 5 bonus tracks so we would expect some of the songs to not be very good.  Overall though, i'd give this a 4 out of 5 for how good the good songs are.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This is useless. I wasted my money on an app that simply refuses to work. It's huge and doesn't even function properly.
0761944524|5.0|I am taking graduate level statistics classes and this is a great supplement to the book my professor uses. In fact, this one is written so clearly that after I sit in class for 3 hours, I come home and teach my self the concepts using this book. Thanks Andy!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book! It's one you'll start and won't want to put down! If your looking for something to read quickly this is it! Can't wait for the next one!
1451695195|5.0|The author has more credibility than other people who may have gone through a similar experience.  Readers who have doubts about an afterlife will have much to think about after reading the experience Dr. Alexander encountered.  I highly recommend this for all people, but especially for those who are seeking a higher understanding of our universe.  This will be very thought provoking.

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|One of the best novels I've read in a very long time. A friend's book club read this and she passed it on to me.  I loved the bookt so much that I bought 4 copies as Christmas gifts for family and friends.  This novel is a mystery within a mystery within a mystery.  Lots of plot twist and turns.  Never saw the ending coming!!!  Would highly recommend this.

B006PAZMMK|5.0|A well put together EP of aggressive bass pounding dub-step beats. Well mixed and mastered for optimal listening enjoyment. Definitely worth the low cost.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|i liked the remake but i still love the original although kenny wormald is a cutie :) but he isnt a fox like kevin bacon !!
B002TVQ4GW|5.0|This is a small indie film that essentially represents what is called a &#34;loop&#34; or &#34;endless loop&#34; film. In this context, a character is condemned to repeat the same series of events over and over again (such as the film Groundhog Day) The story alludes to the mythological figure Sisyphus who was condemned by Zeus to endlessly push a boulder up a hill only to have it fall back to the bottom. According to an essay by French philosopher Albert Camus, there is a certain honor or nobility in continuing that task, even though no matter how a person tries to change the events, he cannot reach a desired outcome.<br /><br />This particular film ties the endless loop scenario within the framework of an apparent slasher genre, but offers a lot more. With a modest budget and low expectations, it produces a very pleasant surprise in terms of the complexity of plotting and themes.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have loved this whole series.  Normally, I get bored with a book series after about the 3rd book.  I still love reading this one.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Without the good, occasionally great, visual effects and engaging aerial combat sequences, this entire film would be unwatchably bad. every single character is one-dimensional and ridiculously cliche, from the scowling, melodramatically villainous Germans to the standard pre-fab action movie cliches the Tuskegee Airmen have been reduced to (the cocky, wisecracking ace; the plucky, naive kid; the gritty, pipe-chomping flight commander, etc.). The plodding, predictable script is abysmal - chock full of heavy-handed expository dialogue right out of a bad comic book, period-inappropriate language that makes it impossible to pretend you're watching the 1940s, and tired plot devices. The acting from this mostly talented cast is poor - wooden, forced and insincere, probably a product of the awful script. And if all that wasn't bad enough, toss in a throwaway romantic sub-plot that's totally devoid of plausibility, sincerity and chemistry.<br /><br />In short, this movie is about what you'd expect from George Lucas - a truly terrible film with cool and exciting action sequences. Star Wars in World War II. It's no wonder he had so much trouble getting it distributed. The Tuskegee Airmen deserve so much better than this stinker.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|one of rachel mcadams best movies as far as her acting. i love her! this movie made me sad happy and angry at the same time.  when a movie makes me have all those emotions then it is truly a great movie
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer is better than most of John Grisham's more recent books. I enjoyed it. It wasn't as clever as some of his earlier books, but if you are a fan you should not be disappointed.
0689835604|2.0|The biggest problem with this book is that the flaps are too flimsy.  My twins love to read books on their own and the flaps are already bend out of shape.  The book itself is cute.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|While not the best Mission Impossible story of the Tom Cruise series this one was not bad.  Certainly the production of sound and picture were great, it just seemed like a some what run-of-the-mill plot.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|this app is a very nice version for ppl who have smartphones but dont have kindles but want to read on their phones in their spare time.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I absolutely CANNOT put down Vince's books once I pick them up!  The level of suspence, the detail, etc is astounding.  Hope there will be many more to come after this one...I'm ready!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|To anyone that likes Sundance movies.  This one is top totch.  The filming style and narrating and all.  Great movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is back !<br /><br />Great read and great fun.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I'm really happy that Vince Flynn is making progress with his cancer issues.  Great author who I hope to be reading for many years to come.<br /><br />This is one of his best !
B005QJZ5FA|1.0|After a horrible SNL performance, I wasn't sure about Lana Del Rey's ability to sing live. However, I was curious about her album after watching and listening to \\"Video Games\\" on YouTube. Turns out the issue isn't the performance venue - it's that her voice is uninspiring and limited (she can hit alto or perhaps lower range notes, yet can barely make another octave). Her voice falls flat, as she seems to be completely disengaged from the music. I have no idea if she did any writing or composing (she is called a \\"songwriter\\"?!), but it sounds like she's auditioning for a part that she clearly doesn't want. The music itself is very simple and oftentimes over-dramatic; are strings necessary for such a lackluster vocal performance? If you couldn't tell from my review title, I'm disappointed with this album!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It was great to be able to watch the episodes I missed while my satellite was out.  The only problems I had was list connection but it did not last long and still got to enjoy my show...
B00834FP5A|5.0|The item came exactly as described within a reasonable time frame. Love the detail. Looks great!  The only bad thing I could say about it is that that if you want to set it up in a flying pose, the stand doesn't support it very well. Mine will stay up for an hour or two before falling over
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a lot like mireo or how ever u spell it.  but that's a good thing because then u know how to make the things work how u want it.
B000683VI4|5.0|this is one awesome movie, i love it and i could watch it over and over and over and over again
B006YXTRHY|5.0|It was good quality, only had one issue with it freezing but when I rewinded it back a little it worked fine through the rest of the movie...
B004FN1SW2|5.0|There is nothing negative that can be said about this book. I like the format and the conversational style of the authors.  Because it was written to teens, it makes it easy to digest even for adults.<br />I especially like the 'To Do List' that comes at the end of each chapter. If the information is implemented into your life you will definitely become a person who attracts success in every area of your life.
B000BZISTE|5.0|I love this movie!!! Glad I waited to buy this one!!! Grab a beer and enjoy the humor and great cast!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Exactly what I expect from Vince Flynn, The Last Man was fantastic!  The action never stops and I have to keep reading!
B0078XM4SI|4.0|Missed hearing new stuff from them.  It is a very solid album, but nothing earth shattering here...nothing really poor either.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Another addictive game that provides hours of entertainment. However there are times (not often) that there appears to be a lag in the response of the game to the action provided, which can cause the player to miss a shot.

B00A8ECU24|2.0|?I thought this would be fun for my five yr old<br />I read the reviewsand they were great.downloaded it. once I started the app it would not let me go back.you cant quit.  then I got messages from game saying my ponies missed me. I don't want an app like this running on my kindle at all times. I deleted it._
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I bought this for a family member for Christmas and they loved it! it is a great movie with great actors!!!
B008RYN44U|2.0|i felt like it was produced by someone who has a name in the business but had lost the edgy sounds and lyrics. i found the music bland and the singing just as bland. not worth your collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Once you get past the grotesque and ravenous hunger of the zombies, this show is full of great character and plot development.  The producers/directors have no qualms about killing off main characters, so there is a lot of risk and suspense in each episode.  I &#34;devoured&#34; seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix in just a few days and now wait impatiently each week for a new episode in season 3.  I would rank this series as just as entertaining as some of my other favorite shows: Breaking Bad, Mad Men and Sons of Anarchy.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|This amacon app did not work for me despite reading on-line help. Horrid! I am very disappointed in Amazon, their Cloud, and the Kindle purchase.

B008G33PMI|4.0|sometimes when an artist goes solo, the quality drops, but not in the case with Tarja, her remakes and new material had energy and a fullness of sound. her vocals, remained strong and at the forefront of her music. Definitely worthy of your collection.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|What a mesmerizing experience! Florence's voice punches you with an electric fist while her lyrics gently kiss & rattle your soul. This album is a true gem and I highly recommend it to everyone.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|Originally a broadway play, this film is one of my favorites. Hepburn, Grant, and Stewart are powerful triumvirate in this romantic comedy. Hepburn plays the emotionally stunted socialite while Grant is effortless in his portrayal of the easy going playboy and it's topped off with Stewart as the witty, sarcastic writer. The plot and the actors work in tandem to make this one of the most memorable films in my collection. If you want a feel-good movie then look no further than this one. There are a few bumps along the way, but what film would be complete with them?
0545128285|5.0|I bought this for my 16 year old granddaughter who is an avid Harry Potter fan.  She loved it, and even insisted on reading it aloud to us by candlelight one evening during a storm that knocked the power out.  If her enthusiasm is any indication, then this book comes highly recommended!
B0063IH60K|5.0|pretty good and simple to play app...suitable for any person and age plus its free we need more like this...well done
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is brilliant, haunting and mind-boggling. Hugh Howey has done an amazing job in weaving a spellbinding story with interesting characters that leave you suspended in time - looking outside of the silo to a gray world, Juliette's world.<br />I was not able to put it down until I read all of the series! It took me 4 days to read the entire series, which involved little sleep BUT well worth it. I am now reading the First Shift - book 6 of Wool and I am devouring it but trying to savor it a bit more so I don't feel disappointed that I am done while waiting for Third Shift.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This is a hilarious movie that occasionally touches on deeper topics like sexuality and bullying. Emma Stone spreads her wings and shows an exceptional sense of comedic timing. If you're a fan of 'She's the Man' or '17 Again' then I would highly recommend this flick. Emma's interactions with her parents, played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, are priceless. I always have a moment while watching the film where I wish they were my parents if only for their humor and charm.
B007FGPZTS|5.0|Shipped perfectly and very fast.<br /><br />I bought this as a Christmas gift so I haven't unwrapped it but I don't see why it would have anything wrong. It's packaged just like if you were to buy a brand new record. If something is wrong I will change my review.
B00407PNWO|5.0|Excellent movie, Great place to buy from A+A+A+A+A+ Was always and Errol Flynn Fan and would to have some mre of his old movies, S will be looking.
1451613512|4.0|Myself, having lived thorough much of the history contained in the book since 1947, found answers to why some events happened as they did. The material covered sure takes the shine off the lily pad. I believe that this book should be required reading for every high school senior, along with the writings of Smedley Butler. The last two chapters, to me, seem the most relevant. They reveal who really runs America, and it's not individual voting citizens!<br /><br />One must keep in mind that this tome is written from a highly biased left wing perspective, and that hindsight is a most valuable tool for writers of historical products. None the less, I believe that the writers did make a good effort at being fair and laying blame where it was to be found.<br /><br />I myself, disagree with their opinion on the A-bombs used on Japan. Those people caused nearly a century of sheer misery on millions of other folk, not to mention themselves. They deserved everything they got!<br /><br />The book would be a good one to keep on your shelf.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Loved this movie.  Unexpected story twists.  Great acting and character development.  It was entertaining from start to finish.  Highly recommend it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I give this game 5 stars because it is great for kids 5 to 105 and this game is awesome!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The film was shot on location, adding to the accuracy of the many simple truths this story told about retirement, friendship, romance, travel, and simply being open to new experiences.  It's a must-watch if you love to travel!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works Great and is pretty accurate for the weather goes out 15 days for the forcast great for planning trips.
0393976041|5.0|The book was in great conditioin and got here very very very very very very very very very very quickly.
B005VSRFEA|2.0|The first few chapters provided a good overview of systems models and systems thinking.<br /><br />As with many business/professional/educational books, I found that the content became repetitive and remained shallow, with very little substance in the second half of the book.  That did not surprise me or disappoint me as much as the very obvious slant toward a liberal agenda evident in all of the 'examples' provided.  Several examples of systems were stated as fact that are, at this time, merely theories.  I found this to be a huge distraction from the message that the book could provide.  I skimmed the second half of the book just trying to get through it.<br /><br />Very disappointing, given the many positive reviews I read before purchasing this book.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|The violence is beginning to be too much. I hate that people who are suppose to love or at the very least care about each other are plotting to kill or at least deeply hurt them instead. The first three seasons were by far the best, and season four is beginning to devolve into a level of violence and betrayal I dislike. I hope season five gets out of this trend and moves it back into a brotherhood and family first before anything else as it once was.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Too Small to see well and you have to get all the way out to stop it and then start it again.
B008FOB124|5.0|i have loved this band since i first heard them, sooo long ago. i have kept up with them over the years and still find them incredibly creative.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I loved this app - it worked very well and was pretty intuitive; however I've had an issue with the app for MONTHS and have not been able to get ONE response to my many emails to the developer.<br /><br />PROBLEM - Images will no longer save, post<br /><br />I can alter images all day long, however the images will no longer save ANYWHERE.<br />Until the recent update - CUSTOM save option would not even display, where I could see if it the images were being placed somewhere unknown(even though searching all files failed to find any)<br /><br />When I try to save - its goes through processing as if it is...but nothing.<br /><br />I wasn't certain if this was related to the Jellybean update it was around that time, but I've not seen this complaint in other reviews or something else. Trying to get any help/response from the developer is about as effective as trying to save something I've done in this app.<br /><br />I saw what could have been a similar review today and a note that the \\"lite\\" app still saves - so I tried that...and low-and behold it does...however you don't have all of the features.<br /><br />I don't know if the \\"save\\" screen should be the same and it is not in the PRO version - missing Email and share option.<br /><br />If anyone else has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|ugh! this game is sooooo unpatriotic George Washington would rather die thannplay a second of this stupid game! this app makes SLENDER MAN run away in terror! even mitt Romney hates this app. my little pony's are secretly trying to rule the world by brainwashing people to do their bidding by their cutsy wutsy songs and their cutsey wutsy LAME adventures!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer is a sweet time waster!  A very awesome no-pressure kind of game.  It is surprisingly deep... Lots of puzzles to complete and whatnot.  No real complaints... 5 star!
B002YK8OKC|5.0|This classic film makes me laugh year after year.  It wouldn't be Christmas without viewing with family as we enjoy time with each other and  our favorite Christmas treats.  The visit from Eddie and the chaos of family get-to-gathers is so familiar to most of us.<br />We look forward to side-splitting laughter each time we watch it.  Love it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is addictive.there is all lot  of courses to play. And you'd want to see how far you can go.lots of difficulty levels.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Megamind is a funny campy cartoon superhero/antisuperhero movie. Our sons love watching it over and over again. Some adult story lines that the kids do not pick up on
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|but the packaging was a disaster, my son was very disappointed to see that the box had been broken BR, very bad service Curier
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a good game for your mind.its a brain teaser. get it.  u will not regret getting this flow free game.Its also FREE. you know that you want to get it.it is deffinitly worth getting this game!
B0002XVQNU|5.0|This was ordered as a gift for Christmas. The new owner will be so thrilled. This will replace the old VHS version that she had previously, that will no longer play.
B00555X8OA|5.0|A mind-opening and provocative book that challenges us to recognize how relatively closed our minds truly are and how little we actully rely on rationality - especially when we are most sure of teh validity of our &#34;thinking.&#34;
B004L53MAA|3.0|The CD is good but the packaging was a disaster, the CD came broken and had to be replaced<br />not repeat the purchase of CDs
1400076943|3.0|This novel was an excellent read for my senior class. The story was something you could connect to on a personal level as a teen girl but had a historical twist.
034580404X|5.0|Was so excited to get this! It was so much cheaper than other websites and arrived the next day. Great purchase!
B005WLQQ4Q|3.0|The CD is good but the packaging was a disaster, the CD came broken and had to be replaced<br />not repeat the purchase of CDs
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks writes the best love stories ever! I am almost done reading all the books he has written and I have a hard putting them down.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was fantastic, very well written and has a very very big ending that will make you want to go out and get the next book when it comes out
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Bought for the grand kids and they absolutely love watching these and some others that I bought at the same time!!!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This game is fun. Gets harder but still great. great graphics an characters. I want more. very quiry. Get it.
B004G6009U|5.0|After seeing Tangled once, I was simply enchanted and entranced! After that, I knew I had to get the Blu Ray (go for the 3D version if you have a 3DTV), and the soundtrack. With Dreamworks/Pixar etc, you'll be glad you got the Blu Ray. Tangled is an absolutely delightful ride for your senses, the emotional richness paired with the engaging wondrous landscapes invite you into this sprawling world of fun and prismatic color!
0525457585|4.0|Any child of the 80s or early 90s remembers the original movie version of The Neverending Story.  However, few have actually ventured to read the book that inspired the movie.<br /><br />The book's text itself is a piece of art, with different font colors representing the narrator's story compared to Bastien's story.  The storytelling is amazing with great descriptions of the fantasy world and its inhabitants.<br /><br />What I was really surprised with was how closely the original movie followed the first part of the story and how horribly the sequels destroyed the rest of the book.<br /><br />People who have seen and grew up with the original movie will be familiar with the majority of the first half of the book, only with much more vivid and awe-inspiring detail and a couple of characters and scenes not found in the movie, likely due to technical limitations.<br /><br />However, the second half of the book is just as amazing, unlike the movie sequels.  The second half of the book focuses on Bastian's journeys in the fantasy world.  This initially starts with him creating some new locations and befriending some amazing new characters.  However, it ends as a much deeper and continued journey of Bastian discovering himself and growing from his experiences.  In some very real ways, Bastian does lose himself in the fantasy world and must find himself again before it is too late.<br /><br />If a person has only seen the original movie this will be a great continuation of the amazing experience that you had with the film.  However, if you were like me and saw ALL of the movies, including the sequels, you owe it to yourself to read this book and to redeem and re-live the experience.  It is truly an amazing book and I regret having not read it earlier in my life.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Love the movie, the artist Adele respect her music, she was the perfect choice to represent this movie, love it!
B008KE3960|5.0|Great game to play while you have time!!! Different twist to a tower defense game. I would recommend it. It get a little hard to manage all the plane in play.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Do you love unadulterated, undiluted, unfiltered, pure, genuine, raw AWESOME!? Then Taken will have to file a restraining order against you, because you're about to send it a &#34;fan letter&#34; gushing about how much you love it, in individually cut-out newspaper and magazine letters. After putting this piece of cinematic history-making bliss into your DVD player, one of two things will happen: You'll never be able to hit the eject button, or, you'll fall victim to spontaneous combustion after witnessing such skull fracturing terrorist slaying wickedly gnarly coolness, exuded by the then little known William John Neeson. Read on...<br /><br />Liam (Or &#34;Li-li&#34; as I call him) is a cherished friend of mine, and when we hang out on the weekends when our schedules allow, it's such a blast drudging up ole' set stories from all the insanity that ensued while filming the eventual sure-fire global sensation that was at the time titled &#34;I was Zeus, trained Batman, and mentored Jedis, and you took my daughter!?&#34; (It was later decided that &#34;Taken&#34; seemed more fitting for box office marques). Oh boy, I remember the time Liam leaned over to me off-camera between takes, and said &#34;Hey, Aaron... give me some sort of hardcore ominous monologue that I can use when I'm on the horn with Marco from the sex-slave trading bizz,&#34; and I immediately lit up like a Christmas tree when it hit me: LIAM, TELL THEM YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS! Now you know, the rest of the story.<br /><br />If you don't own this Blu Ray DVD, Liam will find you... and he will ask to be invited in for a screening with you. He is, after all, an overly polite gentleman. So, buy this Blu Ray, because Li-Li has a habit of showing up at the earlier hours of the morning.
B004V50V9A|5.0|perfect ! Now i just need to find some cheap androids to install it on, so I have em all over
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I totally recommend this book. Cant believe this was the first book the author wrote and how difficult it might have been to write in present tense.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app only shows a few posts down and then nothing. I can only get the ten most recent if I am lucky!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Millions of gamers around the world are all too familiar with this PS3 controller, so I won't get into any sort of boring details where that's concerned. It works just fine. I WILL SAY THAT YOU HAD BETTER MAKE SURE you only buy genuine Sony/PS3 licensed accessories, I foolishly tried buying one of those &#34;replica&#34; Japanese controllers off Ebay, and I GOT BURNED, BADLY. The controller would turn itself off, some of the buttons would stop working, and a whole laundry list of other unpleasant features including hilarious attempts at forging Sony's logos and trademarks.<br /><br />One thing I have taken note of, which is why I didn't give this a 5-star rating, is that at least once a week, AFTER  a full charge, the remote control will flash low battery, and I'll have to plug it in.
0345803485|1.0|I gave it one star only because you don't have the option for zero.  This book is SO badly written, it's a joke.  Beyond that, it's an insult to anyone who paid money for it.  The writing is repetitious -- then it's repetitious some more.  Reuse of words and phrases is rampant.  It's a lie that it was edited to ANY extent, even a third grader would have caught most of the mistakes.<br /><br />There's sort of a story here, but it's overshadowed by the sloppy execution.  If you like characters that CLAMBER, GASP, and bite their lips over and over and over and over and over (it must be a macro), then you'll love this.  Anyone who's ever read a decently written book, however, will want to throw it in the fireplace.<br /><br />A fantastic attempt at the dumbing down and ripping off of readers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldnt put the book down (or out- kindle version). Cant wait to read book #2. I know it is not Shakespeare but it is indeed very entertaining. Loove it!
B008BM9L72|2.0|Thought I better read this trilogy to see what all the fuss is about. It is poorly written with a predictable storyline, and I wasn't a fan, but had to admit that there is something that makes the reader keep turning the pages. It wasn't for me, but passed the time on a long flight.
0811875555|5.0|I bought this as a gift, but Tangled is one of my all time favorite movies. This book really embodies and projects the characters from the film, and lays out in practical clear steps, how to replicate the animation from the film. Tangled was a visual feast, and after connecting with the characters, or the storyline, you'll want to get closer to the action by learning how to make everyone come to life for yourself. It is a fun, colorful, guide to creating spectacular renderings for anyone already somewhat skilled and acquainted with artistic techniques!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Awesome books that have more depth and colour to the plot than the TV series. Though the TV series was visually spectacular, the books have more substance.
0385737955|3.0|Overall, I thought this was a good read. The dialog was believable, and I thought the slang of the Glade added an extra element of fun. The characters and plot were a little flat, but Dashner did a good job of keeping me interested. The ending was a little on the weak side and seemed a bit contrived. That said, it still had enough of a twist to make me want to read the sequel.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie.  Great price.  Definitely worth buying.  Also great gift for 11 year old nephews to watch over and over again.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Would have given it five stars if Vince Flynn had been more like James Clavell in writing the appropriately lengthy &#34;Shogun&#34;. Other than it being too quick a read, Flynn doesn't disappoint.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I can't wait for the seqel.  It is a disturbing book but a tale of true love.  I can't wait to see things from Travis's perspective.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love John Grisham.  He doesn't let you down in story after story.  You can always count on a good read with characters that you can visualize.  I'm enthralled with the courtroom drama and behind the scenes of the legal world.  I've learned much from his stories and appreciate his very keen way of telling them.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Love this movie.  Love the blu-ray price.  AND it came with a free download of the film on my amazon prime account.
B0090EJR1K|3.0|another product from Sacha...<br />if you have 1.5 hours available and you're<br />NOT expecting a lot...then yes.watch it.<br />many &#34;ugly&#34;jokes mix with bright ideas.<br />not for kids for sure.<br />generally,not art just a pub's jokes.
B00A77II0U|4.0|The game is very well made but maybe a bit easy. Movement through the game is highly intuitive, so the player has no trouble navigating. I found it to be a little short; on the other hand, it wasn't filled w/ silly &quot;conversation&quot; or other time fillers. I recommend this game!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|It is a great movie, funny and sweet. Interesting concept of starting a retirement facility in India. Great actors, quirky and funny plot. Thoroughly entertaining all the way through. I gave it a 5 star rating because it is one of those (rare) movies I wouldn't watching again in a few weeks.
0670023329|5.0|This book is hard to stomach, but really needs to be read.  Details from the mouth of someone who was born and raised in North Korean camps.  Horrific and heartbreaking- this is a good read and something that everyone should get their hands on and pass on.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I am not a true Aliens fan but I did enjoy this prequil.  The film has a more European feel with artsy elements.  The performances are middle of road but not as essential to the story line which dominates.  For those of strong stomach, Prometheus is entertaining and often darkly humorous.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I love every song on here, I wasnt A huge Rihanna fan before but this album is truly impressive. I'm obsessed with it!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Rented this movie for thanks giving weekend.. Kids enjoyed it. I dont think its really come in disney's collection category
B007DIQC90|5.0|My poor husband has been listening to this on repeat, since I bought it.  If you like that main song on the radio, then you'll love the entire album.  Great buy!
B009FXIICK|2.0|I love some of the jewel match 3 games so thought I'd try this, plus the reviews were so high. I played through several levels, not very challenging, then decided to waste my time and efforts on other FUN games. This app is a waste of time and precious Kindle storage space.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the books and this kindle version had all 3 books and they all led right into the other! Recomend to anyone who liked the harry potter or twilight series
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I love Doctor Who, and I was happy to finally be able to purchase the series set, considering the DVDs are MSRP is ~$80, at a reasonable price.  \\"Rose\\" started out slow, but it gets really good later on.<br /><br />If you've purchase Series 1 from Amazon, and it's states in the Product Details: DVD Release Date: June 19, 2012.  That means that the set comes in a single DVD case with those detachable holders!  The DVDs do not come in separate cases nor the folding case!  It is not like the original 2006 set release.<br /><br />I already knew what I was getting into when I purchase it at $23, that I might be getting a single case for the set.  And I don't mind that's it's single case.  Please be aware of this when you make your purchase.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Wonderful movie, however; the blu-ray disc was damaged upon arrival. By my own mistake, I did not open the package for this disc to Amazon within the return window, and am out the money as the last 40 minutes of the movie are unwatchable.<br /><br />This movie is a fun, action-packed superhero movie you would expect given the contemporary demand for these types of movies. I think X-Men first class actually sets itself apart as this movie has more \\"soul\\" and character development that allows the audience to empathise with the characters than most superhero movies of today. It's not in the class of Nolan's Batman trilogy, but it blows away the Avengers series, and the X-Men franchise movies from the early 2000s.<br /><br />Fine movie with a lot of re-watchability. Fassbender is tremendous as always, and this allows the ensemble cast to play up to his level. Give it a try even if you don't like X-Men.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|loved item, perfect for my daughters hello kitty rock star party, great size and price, would recommend for others to buy
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I watched this movie and I recommend to everyone and anyone that is looking for encouragement to watch this. Great Watch!
0525952926|5.0|Excellent weave of history and characters in a complex dynamic setting.  War, politics, and family interactions told in a believable manner.
B004LP10PO|4.0|Steve McQueen lights up the screen once again in Thomas Crown affair.  Thomas Crown is not the most likeable person in the movie but McQueen brings his charisma to the character, and fools the audience into admiring this crooked business man.<br />Faye Dunaway does a great job as a secondary character to McQueen.  Although it's a bit dated, the clothes and cars are amusing to see again.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|This is one of my favorite songs of all time, from my favorite band.  Sound quality is great!  And you can't beat $0.99!
B007SGM084|5.0|What can you say about these books?? I got so involved with the story line that the ... ahem... &#34;extras&#34; were just topping on the cake! lol I had heard they were addicting but thought it was a cop out for just wanting to read the .. &#34;extras&#34; that I waited to buy it.  Bought it, LOVED it, and hated to leave the characters when I was done!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This is kind of a weird love story but FUN to watch.  The music was fabulous.  Ewan McGreggor sang GREAT!!!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter should be the story that's told in history books.  The movie does a fantastic job incorporating the historical aspects of his life, as well as the dark and twisted missions that he and his followers go on to rid the US of vampires.  Produced by Tim Burton, I figure you can't go wrong.  The movie never gets old.  The only negative I have is that in the book there's a cameo of Edgar Allan Poe when they're in New Orleans, I think that should have been in the movie, for some comedic effect.
B009P5S11G|4.0|I like Rhianna and this is another great CD.  My only negative I have is the inside booklet has a ton of pictures of her smoking.  Really?!?  All the pictures are of her acting \\"cool\\" with a cigarette - so not cool.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|awesome game love it great puzzles and mysterious games keeps you wanting more.  I cant wait to play the games of special enquiry
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie!!!!! I am buying it as a gift this year for a family member.  It was received quickly and in perfect condition.<br />A must see!
B002C4YYEU|4.0|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a sad movie, but perfect in a sense where the story comes full circle.  The director did a wonderful job outlining the parallels between the two characters.  Button who starts life as an old man, who travels in the reverse of aging, and his female counterpart played by Cate Blanchett who ages &#34;normally.&#34; The concept of time and age are intricately woven throughout the movie.  The characters age in their different ways from the 40s up to present day when we learn of the fall of our characters.  However, I have not read the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, so I'm not exactly sure how close it ties to the book.  The only other downside is that it's a long movie, but doesn't feel long, but there are some slow moving parts.  Overall, great movie. Definitely worth owning.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Excellent book.  Loved reading about the culture in India, his time at sea, how he survived .  Was that really a Bengal tiger????
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great concept, well written. Characters are well developed and the story keeps you engaged.  A book that makes you think.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Wireless headsets that give you a good 10 hrs of free movement. Love the surround sound for these headsets i could literally hear in which the direction gun fire is coming from. I live in a single bedroom apt and i can take the headsets from my living room to my bathroom in the back and no interference whatsoever.<br />Pro: Wireless, 7.1 surround sound, great equalizer for those who are looking for a specific sound to change to, 3 buttons on the headset that you can make any button while gaming.<br /><br />Con: Bass needs more work, if you turn up the headsets up then they sound really distorted, but not sure if because i bought them Like new. Needs its own usb plugin because of the base and i think it should use the unifying receiver.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend to friends and anyone who want a good 7.1 surround sound headset.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Not overly dramatic, and scenes seem so real. Scares me just enough where I can still sleep and not be terrified. Great story line, I am definitely a fan of this show.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I liked the book, kept my attention. It was not great, but it was a fun and wacky read. Peggy Garrett
1400069289|3.0|A half dozen fascinating stories reflecting on habits, but no science, just hand waving. I still don't know what a habit is.
B005PK553C|5.0|This is the best story going now on TV. The characters are believable and draw you in to the story. These stories are not for children or the weak stomach.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|awesome movie in my opinion. if you have seen it and have a blue ray player, no reason not to own this
B0076DCT2G|1.0|The only book DeMille has written that I did not like. All took place in Yemen.<br />Glad when it was over
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I must admit I didn't particularly care for History when I was in school.  This book, however, kept me engrossed.  The great figures of history are usually either portrayed as saints or villans but rarely as real people.  Lincoln, to me, was one of the saints who saved the union and freed the slaves.  Just one more of the historical figures from the beginnings of our country.  Using direct quotes and eye witness accounts from people of his time who knew him,  Ms. Goodwin made Lincoln come alive as a person with clarity and detail showing how he dealt with a national crisis, the major political players of his age, the political currents of his time with all the competing views both liberal and conservative, and his personal difficulties within his own family.  It made Lincoln, his cabinet members, the generals, and all the other people who populated the book seem very modern in a way.  After reading the book, I felt like I knew these people.  It made Lincoln human which to me only enhanced his stature since it showed how this very human, but very wise and caring person was able to rise to the enormous challenges that he faced.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|its just like angry birds space. I hats it. if maybe they mixed it up just a little I would love it. but no same old thing. I say don't buy it!
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Well if you like this movie just buy it already. not much to review. everything works just fine and shipped fast
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've been a staunch fan of Grisham for many years...back to &#34;ATime To Kill&#34;  as well as his non-fiction, and I have enjoyed all of his work that I have read.  This one, though, is my least favorite because some of the character's relationships seem to me to be a stretch, and for me at least, the story did not flow as effortlessly as some others.  Do I regret spending time reading it, heck no!  At his worst, Grisham is a great story-teller and I look forward to all his new releases.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am a big Tina Fey fan and her book did not disappoint. It is interesting, well-written, and multiple parts are laugh-out-loud funny. My favorite sections are about the theater camp she was a part of as a teen - probably because I can relate to some similar experiences.<br /><br />This book can appeal to a wide variety of readers. My 50-something dad is actually the one who insisted I read it. Highly recommended!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|BBC rules as per my tastes.  But I might be a tad prejudiced having been born there and find myself fascinated with period pieces all  over  the world.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|awesome movie in my opinion. if you have seen it and have a blue ray player, no reason not to own this
B009WO7NQO|1.0|What is that anyway? totally disappointed, you have to pay for each level? I have nothing more to say. duh
0811879542|5.0|My 5-year old daughter was given this book and absolutely loves it. It is a fun interactive book for adults to enjoy with children. Older children will be able to enjoy the book on their own. While my daughter loves it because it is fun, this book has managed to seamlessly include many different educational and developmental themes. Children can learn cause-and-effect, colors, and math skills.
0345505387|2.0|I am a big big fan if Jamie and Clair and there is absolutely nothing to compare to sitting to read about them. I have read them all and was so excited to hear about the book The Exile. I was so disappointed I haven't even finished it. I don't want to look at cartoons. I want to read a book with a 1000 pages. I think most mature people who are fans want to do that as well.<br />It sounds like the next one will be of little interest as well, if it is several short stories. Why change this beautiful story, it is so informative about the period, a beautiful love story, sexy and rivoting at times. Please go back to the original style your fans are waiting for it...
B007HACDLK|5.0|Read it in no time.  It is freaky how Vince Flynn can crystal ball the political/military scenarios around the world, and do it a year ahead of time.
1449410243|5.0|The Oatmeal will make you laugh so hard with this book. And you'll never look at your cat the same way again.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|When my old trusty cable disintegrated one day, I learned that this replacement cable (re-designed to not disintegrate) is FREE from Amazon as a replacement for earlier and poorly made cables that shipped with the Kindles. I didn't even have to pay shipping. I love how Amazon stands behind their products and offer real support.
B003Z0BSU8|5.0|As the heading to this review states, this is Andsnes' favourite concerto recording to date and, having bought several of his recordings all of which are very fine, I would be inclined to agree. Certainly it, and the whole series now achieved, must rank alongside the finest available.<br /><br />The approach to the third concerto is forward moving and dramatic and in this he is fully supported by Pappano, a conductor who has been responsible for a large number of operatic recordings of drama and whose character and conducting skills seem ideally suited to this approach. Not surprisingly Andsnes opts for the larger of the two cadenzas and in this he is totally able to match Ashkenazy with Previn which is no mean feat. This concerto has the greater sense of spontaneity however and this is clearly apparent in the thrilling build up to the first movement cadenza which ends in a marked final acceleration rather than a pulling back as is so often the case. This is one of many wonderful moments when all is put on the line and carried off with conviction.<br /><br />The 4th concerto is less of a warhorse in character and includes a myriad of influences including sideways references to the jazzy feel of a Gershwin. This was not so well liked by the initial reviewers who probably felt cheated with the lack of obvious big tune. One wonders what they themselves could have written of musical value. Rachmaninov undertook s number of revisions which reduced and concentrated the work which is what we hear today and on this record. The performance is delivered with the same quality of the third.<br /><br />EMI have provided a fittingly full recording quality and this is an altogether exceptional disc. The only way to improve its attraction so far as I can see is for purchasers to buy the complete set now available as a combined purchase. Owners of the first disc can buy this follow-up with complete confidence. The change of orchestra from the BPO to the LSO remains a mystery to me as both are equally good.s both are equally good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game keeps me occupied for hours. I'm tempted to buy the news packs because it is realy that much fun. It's a great brain teaser with many different levels and ways to test yourself on the time trials too.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|... you're into comic book-based flicks.  It nicely pulls together story lines from previous films (Ironman, Thor, Hulk), adds some new characters (that need more development) and provides a base for additional material.  Give the current level of character development, a lot will depend on keeping the cast together.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I played through Journey for the first time today, and it actually made me cry twice.  I don't even know why!  I've never cried because of a video game before lol.  I think I was just overwhelmed by how beautiful it was at times.  Which again...I'm not sure I've ever cried because something was beautiful before.  That said, I haven't even gotten to the other games on this disc yet.  I only paid fifteen bones for this puppy, so for me this was a great purchase!
B004N66XYE|5.0|Saw on MPT, after setting to record series so I wouldn't miss it, I enjoyed so much I ordered both seasons so I could watch in its entirety whenever I wanted to watch without waiting in curiosity each week. I had watched the older version that was on reg tv yrs ago as a series. That prompted me to watch this version because I enjoy these type movies and their history/lifestyle & costumes of dress in that time.<br />If you like Downton Abbey you will certainly like this as well. I rec'd my order very quickly after ordering in great packaging and condition, and will follow up with the orig set
B005723JSQ|5.0|I have read every Sophie Kinsella book that's been published, as usual she delivers a fun read. I love the premise of the story and will enjoy reading every last word.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|It is faithful to the basic outline of Snow White and provides some interesting detail, for example, why the queen is wicked.  The acting for some roles could be better, but if you are looking for something interesting to spend some time with, it is worth it.
055357342X|1.0|I decided to read the books because, my mom turned me on to the HBO Series. I really liked the series and as you know there's never enough time in a movie or tv series to give you the back story.  The first two books followed the storyline mostly and provided the necessary background information to give you a fuller picture of the characters and so forth.  In the third book the story has taken such a turn for the worse that now, I not only don't want to finish the book. I may not even continue watching the series.  What a turn off for me.  It's just like Harry Potter all over again.  I put in so much time reading those books, seeing those movies and the end was awful.  It made me feel like I wasted my time.  I just don't want to do it again.
081299471X|5.0|This is easily one of the best books I have ever read. A seriously engaging and through-provoking work. I plan to read this over many times, finding new treasures with each reading. I would recommend it to any avid reader.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This story is typical Grisham...well plotted, full of interesting situations...I liked it...didn't love it.!!  A good read that keeps you guessing.
1451620829|5.0|It was a very entertaining book much better than Simmons and Frehley's plus on the reunion show Mr. Criss was mostly clearheaded and sober which gives the reader a hint his memory is much better than Frehley's recommended if u are a diehard KISS fan!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is just like the computer and xbox version the only complaint I have to say- updates and items. we have one of the worst versions EVER. also there isn't even emerald ore or mods yet. great game!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a really fun game.  The hidden pictures where often challenging so I didn't get bored.  The graphics and music were great. The one thing I didn't care for was the tediousness of travel. It would have been better if the map let you move around from place to place.  All in all an enjoyable game and well worth the money. I am looking forward to the sequel.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I haven't opened it yet but I have heard their first song and it sounds great. KISS is my favorite classic rock groups
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Batman will always be iconic he has no superpowers but he is the best superhero!!!<br /><br />Christopher Nolan wrote/directed a great storyline, Tom Hardy was superb as Bane (Academy Award) and a satisfying conclusion 5 STARR RECOMMENDED!!<br /><br />P.S. Anne Hathaway was megahot as Catwoman!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|whats not to like with free? You can do it without in-app purchases. Facechecks on social nets gets more bucks for building.Practice first with Virt. City 1
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great DVD to watch! It's even better watching it the second time! Highly recommend seeing this one!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I read this book in two days, it kept me fully engaged as I continued to experience the many facets of the adventures of Mitch Rapp.  The story is timely and speaks to some of the issues that are currently in play in our Middle East policy day.  It was a fun read, and while I gave it 5 stars because of my overall enjoyment of this book, as I recall I was a little disappointed in the ending but then the story is not yet over.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am so happy when I begin a new Vince Flynn book and so depressed when I finish because I know I will have to wait awhile for the next one.
B00005YUNY|4.0|Yes on their toes giving a nice live performance. You'll have to read more of these words because they require a minimum # of words here.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Richard Ford has created a voice that is both wise and innocent.  The descriptions are laser sharp.  The characters' decision making processes are as muddled as inteligent humans can make them.  The children - eyes open - are swept across the great North American landscape.  A wonderful read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. It is fun for a while. I would recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead season 3 continues in the ghastly footsteps of seasons 1 and 2 with the saga continuing to surprise and astound with good storyline and special effects. Don't grow attached to favorite characters,  as there are fewer humans than there are walkers,  just sayin.
0374275637|5.0|This book is encyclopedic in nature. You will navigate through literally hundreds of studies as Daniel Kahneman connects them together into a single story.<br /><br /> If you want a casual, easily comprehensible read, then get Malcolm Gladwell's &#34;Blink&#34;; it literally discusses the exact same subject, but in a more casual less in-depth manner.<br /><br />I personally recommend first reading &#34;Blink&#34; as a primer, and then jumping into this behemoth. If you read these two books in that order your vision of why you choose to do anything, ever will be forever transformed.<br /><br />Both books tell the story of the two parts of our brain. There is an older intuitive brain, which, according to a litany of studies, is the primary decision maker. Then there is our conscious deliberate brain, the part that you think of as you.<br /><br />Why do we make the choices we make? Are we aware of the subtle environmental influences that effect our decision making? By the time you finish this book you'll have gone through hundreds of studies that reveal how little we know about our inner lives.
B002ZG981E|5.0|When Inception came to the theaters, I was interested, but had not yet gotten to watching the movie.  Then I received a text from my brother saying \\"Dude, go see Inception, I need to talk to someone about this movie\\".  I laughed, but then I went to see it.  As soon as the credits rolled, I was on the phone with him talking about Nolan's amazing cinema skills.  When I got home, the first thing I said to my girlfriend was \\"We need to see Inception\\", and the very next day I was back in the theater.<br />Inception's plot has been tossed around on the internet, parodied, praised, and punished since its release.  Yet you cannot avoid a sense of wonder in the scope of the movie.  Dream landscapes, mental quandaries, and a beautiful score will haunt your imagination.<br />Please pick up a copy of Inception and enjoy this film.<br />I would just like to add to those who have already watched Inception (SPOILER), have you noticed Cobb only wears his wedding ring when he is dreaming?
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. It is fun for a while. I would recommend it.
B005L38QK2|1.0|downloaded the software....... didn't work, downloaded the patch.... didn't work..... emailed company..... no reply yet....... time wasted trying to fix it and reading things off there website....... not getting back.....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it... Couldn't put it down!! Leave you yearning for more and more. Very good detail, and story line. Excellent
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is a confiurmation of what I have held in my faith belief.  Hearing it from a scientist made it all the more interesting.  it is very wasy reading and certainly well worth the time and effort for anyone searching for Proof of Heaven.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. It is fun for a while. I would recommend it.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I think I'll buy this movie to add to my collection. It's worth watching again. The acting and overall production was pretty good.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Terrific read ... nailbiter ... tough characters and a twisty plot.  Another ace effort by Vince Flynn.  Makes me want to go back and re-read the previous novels.
B004F1F32A|4.0|The movie is grey and it was a good download/viewing experience. No drive to the store or redbox and no disc to return- that's the best part for our crazy house!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. It is fun for a while. I would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A nice read, the plot is good even if straight forward a bit. I would not hesitate to recommend it !
B003N0XDT4|2.0|I bought a non-portable portable amp, battery doesn't keep its charge like most people's review said. I bought it \\"new\\", some people got it in a box? I got mine in a bag inside of an amazon box, Is this truly new? I don't plan on returning it, I might as well keep it instead of getting 30$ The sound is great, might as well throw in 10$ for a LOD. This was just for outside my house amplifying, as I'm planning on buying Schiit audio gear later on for inside house use.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I didn't particularly like this book and didn't finish it.  It just didn't fit the book I needed at the present time.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. It is fun for a while. I would recommend it.
B0093X805W|5.0|This is a great story! Love both movies as well and highly recommend them all! I love how each movie has different parts of the book that are original.
034580404X|5.0|I love the whole thing it was not about the sex I loved the love story as it unfolded as well. She saves him!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A  good read. Not as good as the first in the series though.  The part with Peeta and the brain washing was a little far fetched.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I bought this after seeing the movie and have enjoyed reading it. I would recommend this to other people. Great!
0061906220|5.0|I bought this for a friend who is a teacher for her birthday. She loves it. When I received it at home and removed it to gift wrap it, it was in excellent condition.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|Haunting melodies and profound lyrics are the essence of this very enjoyable collection. This is classic &#34;Floyd&#34; at its best!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another intriguing well written book by Grisham. Fiction that could well be Non-fiction! Everyone loves someone who gets<br />even with the system.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. I would try to find one that has more abilities.
B0032O6S4I|5.0|My daughter got this for Christmas 2 years ago when she was 3. It continues to be a well loved toy even now. It was not hard to put together, as my 10 year old daughter assembled it on Christmas morning with no help! It does have many small parts to keep up with, so keep this in mind. We have it set up in her room on an old square coffee table we painted white, and it puts it at the perfect level when sitting on the floor to play. We have left it this way since the beginning because you really can't move it easily. A train table would also be great for this. We also got the meerkat set and the koala/kangaroo set to go with it, and last year she got some add-on animals to keep it fresh and new. My only gripe is the price, but it is a nicer quality toy that will grow with your child and lets them use their imagination. No batteries either! One tip:If you have a ToysRUs near you, I'd check out their playmobil section first, as their price for the big zoo was $84 when I purchased! ;)
B009FXIICK|3.0|Cute game appeals to kids but kids couldn't play it.<br /><br />The timer doesn't give enough time after about 6 levels.<br /><br />Get rid of the help and if the person hasn't made a match in 4 seconds give help .
B0061Q13V2|5.0|Listening to her story of being a young gymnast and the great coaches she had in her life, and then those not so great, it was an eye opening experience into the real world of gymnastics.  I think she could have been an even greater gymnast, if she wasn't forced to train with the Karoly's and if her father stood behind her and did what was right for her.  Great read!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire. It is fun for a while. I would recommend it.
B009D5VPTI|4.0|I love Disney movies!  By the way, the music from this movie is great!<br /><br />This movie was cute.  I love the accents.  I wish they'd done more with the triplets!  They were cute and great!  They could do something like they do with the Penguins of Madagascar. They were pretty entertaining, wish we'd seen more of them.  The suitors were hideous, which made it funny.  It's another buyable movie!
B000003NA3|5.0|Non deve mancare nella discoteca di qualunque appassionato di Jazz. Coltrane ai massimi livelli di espressività. Le parole a questo punto diventano strette per descrivere le emozioni e le sensazioni prodotte da questo cofanetto. Imperdibile!
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a fun game you can build many different buildings make it the way you want but it seems to take more battery power than most games idk
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|One of the best movies i've seen. Really puts you in the place of the protagonist and makes you feel all of the emotions around. Definitely recommended.
0316232955|5.0|I really loved this book. Carson was witty and funny, yet a prick to a lot of the characters. The story line was really thought out and Carson's character was really fleshed out. I recommend the book to young adults especially those who need a lift and something to look toward to. Great book!
B007TK77QE|3.0|Stop at Harry Potter. Bought this for the Rowlings name and really cannot think of any comment other than it was ordinary.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is awesome. Keeps me busy when I am bored. The graphics are great. Recommend this game for anyone.
B000OW77UU|5.0|One of the best movies i've ever seen. It is very motivational and makes you think twice about all of the things you take for granted in life. And what the real objective is.
1419705849|5.0|I got this for my son and he loves it. Not only was it in my price but it got here early then it said it would
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Enjoy the series - read this on a 'plane. This was not as enthralling as many of the other titles.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Best TV Drama series since &#34;Lonesome Dove&#34; I would recommend to anyone who is interested in world politics. Not for children!
B00A135YUW|5.0|Lana Del Ret never fails to amuse me in her lyrics, and vocal style. There's something fun about figuring out the symbols and motifs in her songs. She's definitely got some interesting things to say. I definitely recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear some revolutionary music.
B00979CS50|5.0|One of the best album of Neil Young. A &#34; garage&#34; CD with the Crazy Horse. Even better than &#34;Ragged Glory&#34; (a &#34;5 star&#34; of Rolling Stones),  because without limit ( 2 CD are necessary with a 27 minutes song ).<br />&#34; Rock'nd roll will never Die &#34; &#34; This is the story of .... Neil Young&#34;
B0060FXBNM|5.0|If you or anyone in your life loved the Transformers Movies you or whoever you get these for will be getting a great deal... I'm not going to talk about the movies, but I will tell you that the purchase was fast and easy as always and it was at my door step in less than 3 days... the  blue ray movies played great and packageing was great as well...
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Not just Disney fans need to pay attention to this 70th Anniversary edition DVD out now. The classic Pinocchio is like a fine wine, it gets better with age.
0741470314|5.0|I want express my appreciation to dr. Moriarty for writing this book. Michael's story is told as one of a human being, a person rather than a persona, which is so rare. As a long-time fan of Michael, I am very touched by the way he is humanized in this book.<br /><br />Michael is viewed within the context of his unique circumstances, good and bad, which makes all the difference in the way one sees him. I love the quote: bizzare behaviour is normal in bizzare circumstances. Bravo! I wish that people who want to learn more about Michael and his life would choose this book.<br /><br />Also, one can tell that the author genuinely sympasizes with and admires Michael Jackson. Its touching, warm and heartfelt - thank you for that.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good app for passing the time instru&ccedil;tions on some games aren't the best. what do you expect its free it does have a wide variety of games
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Definitely the funniest parts were in the trailers. I think if fell short of my expectations. I had hoped for more. I do think that it's probably pretty realistic but overly dramatic at the same time. The pregnancy &#34;glow&#34; is real enough but I think that it get exaggerated by would-be mothers. Pregnancy is definitely not as fun as it seems in this movie.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Had to remove the case so they could hear me on the other end. Not a good choice. Looks nice but inhibits phone usage
B0091REZMW|3.0|its a fun game to play but it getting boring after a bit its the samething over and over again
B00021HBGS|3.0|You know that pinkish color mold that sometime accumulates in the corners of the showers when you haven't gotten around to cleaning?  I think that this product attracts that stuff.<br /><br />They are adorable but I would not recommend to a friend.
0399226907|5.0|I haven't had a young child in my family for many years.  I had to go to some young moms for suggestions when I had to buy some children's books.  This is one that was suggested repeatedly by quite a few of them.  Apparently it is a book that children have their parents reread many times.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was so much fun to read and see how Ana and Christen grow together. I wish there were more books to this series.
B008OJ291W|3.0|....that being said, I suppose I went into this one with my eyes open. It was never advertised as anything other than faithful re-workings of Jeff Lynnes past songs, it's just that I was hoping for some really great embellishments. Oh well, guess I'll have to wait for the remaster of Zoom.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn. Great as usual always excited and has u on the edge of your seat. If you like spy novels get this book
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Why gems to buy Rarity? I will not spend actual money to buy a virtual pony. fix it to the coin bits and it'll be a better game.
B009715NUK|3.0|This is sloppy and sounds like a throw-away single for the Boys. The Winner single had three great tracks to back it but those here are PSB's By Numbers type songs. Have to admit that Hell is funny as...well hell!
1451695195|4.0|Excellent narrative, very good companion read to &#34;Heaven is for real&#34;, which is a childs view.  I liked the more advanced explanation of the view of the author, it appealed to my science background.  The actual explanation of what heaven might be like was not as detailed as I would like, but the scientific analysis allowed me to understand a more believable idea of what the author experienced.  The childhood version of Heaven is for real was simplistic, but both books were similar enough to convince the reader that heaven was visited by both.  Both books agreed with the religious studies I have made, and I could see nothing contrary to the Bible in either writing.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I chose those rating because I have rarely seen the quality of research and writing together in history topics.  This gives this period of this country as well as the qualities and lives of the four men the depth to keep my attention page after page.  It gives the strengths and weaknesses.
B0063IH60K|5.0|can not say much, i just like to play solitaire.  helps to keep my mind active and to improve memory funtion.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|This is a great gift for my dad but I noticed that the Bluray was enclosed but the advertised Ultraviolet Digital copy was not.  Apparently there was a disconnect between the advertisement and the factual item.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|I've watched this several dozen times and it never gets old. I always see something new or discover some hidden nugget or piece of wisdom.<br />One of my favorite films for sheer enjoyment.
0802473156|5.0|Self-reflection is one of the best things you can do for yourself and your own happiness.  This book helps you learn what things you need/want to feel loved and appreciated, and also helps you to determine the same for others.  It is great to help couples feel closer and more connected.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I always loved Tetris as a child (and adult), and Blokus is just as fun and challenging for me and the whole family (including young children, just got to modify the play a bit).
0240810961|5.0|Nothing like Disney and the ability to look at the Masters is just wonderful, it has been years since I've drawn and a bit gun shy as they say. Interesting to see the techniques used by these artist and learn from them
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I can't believe I loved this movie, I really have never liked musicals but where I love 80's rock music I thought I would give it a try. I was singing along real quick. I found myself buying the soundtrack right after the movie went off. And with a beauty like Julianne Hough was was hard to look away! Her singing voice is really nice too! Star studded cast a must see!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|I smile every time I think about perceiving this world from a bee's point of view, and there are several one-liners that make me &#34;lol.&#34;
0670022411|5.0|Have all three and waiting for the next on pins and needles!<br /><br />Great story and enjoyed it have re-read several times
B0088EDMMS|2.0|Great movie to share and watch during the season. However, this blu-ray version wasn't any better than the previously released DVD version. In fact, some scenes were so &#34;noisy&#34; that I found it distracting! Other than that, the movie Hocus Pocus is a good family flick which will last for generations.
B00005JLCI|5.0|An overwhelming experience. I actually feel it would be out of place for any of us to review or criticize or even praise such a contribution to the world's artistic achievements. One just has to sit there and watch and listen and marvel.  (Many times.)<br /><br />Just one thing that has nothing to do with the work - I am, it seems,  in a small minority of TV/DVD owners who can watch all regions.  This Hamlet is so far available only on Region One, but I know many people who would immediately buy this if they could watch it on their regional devices.  Why only Region One?
0571238343|5.0|Insightful for methods haven't used before... just beginning to draw again<br />I would say not a beginner book but a great resource for the rest
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|What more can I say? Anyone who looks for the flaws in this movie, and there are a lot, considering the man is a supposed genius and all... Just doesn't get it. The man might be rich, but he's never done anything &#34;real&#34; in his entire life. Which he explains (regarding his knowledge of all things) right from the start of the movie. If anyone misses the point, he explains this again by the end.
B007MDB548|5.0|I have loved all the Disney Fairies movies, but this is the first one I've seen in 3D and I have to say it was awesome!  The colors and landscapes in this movie are beautiful in 3D!!  Nothing like feeling like you're actually right there in Pixie Hollow!
1936608618|5.0|Been training with CFE program for 2 years now, done CFE seminar and this book puts together all the info in a very well explained detail with pics and descripition of the best way to train in an efective way, this is a must have for all endurance athletes or beginers.
B0012YYZYK|2.0|So why the two stares? Because this version of the movie supposedly came with previously unreleased material. Which is just not true! Perhaps the two disc version has this supposed material. But this DVD certainly did not. As a Zeppelin maniac, I have seen this movie hundreds of times. And this movie, while in blu ray, doesn't have a single moment which the regular DVD doesn't have. Now that Celebration Day has been released... I would have Zeppelin Fans consider that option instead.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I loved the movie from beginning to end. The acting was great, the guys are hot, the music was awesome, and the dancing was superb!<br />I fell in love with Channing Tatum's character and wish I could find a guy like that. Not for kids and probably not going to thrill your boyfriend or husband. Definitely a chick-flick. Great for a girl's night treat!
B006LSZECO|5.0|loved the plot, something many women might &#34;think&#34; of doing. It was a page turner and simply a good mystery.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|We bought this in local store for $19.99, because my daughter is an Angry bird fan. This game was made of cheap, light-weighted material. It is almost impossible to stack the pieces as instructed. I have to keep stacking it for my daughter to break. She lost interests after 20 minutes, and never touched again since. Even at a low price of $6.99, it's not worthwhile.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I find that most of this album is really very good.  There are multiple uptempo songs that rock out raw and hard (Luv XXX, Lover Alot, Legendary Child and more...) and a few slower heavier songs that are quite good as well (Closer, Something, Oasis in the Night).  Yes there are too many ballads, at least 3 too many, however, with the extra tracks provided on the deluxe version(s) of this CD one gets all together somewhere around 60-70 minutes of solid rock 'n roll, (subtracting 3 ballads).  There isn't nearly enough of that coming out any more these days.  Of course paying extra for the deluxe variants of this CD is annoying but that's how it is.  Finally, the mix on this CD is better than I've heard from Aerosmith in a long, long time.  It's raw but still well balanced and doesn't sound overproduced.  A major improvement over the last two studio albums of original material - Nine Lives and Just Push Play....<br /><br />The criticisms of this album appear to me to be far out of proportion.  Aerosmith has changed, all bands change.  There will never be another album like Rocks or Toys in the Attic.  That being said Aerosmith can still rock hard and raw (especially live, take a look at \\"You Gotta Move\\" - DVD).  In fact, I would say that they sound better live in their older years than they did when they were younger.  This is probably due to a number of reasons:  a measure of sobriety leading to improved musicianship, longer variations/jams on songs in concert, and the better sounds systems available today.<br /><br />Give the new album a listen.  Rip the songs to a music file and delete the sappy ballads and you're left with a damn good rock 'n roll record.. Enjoy!!<br /> My two cents anyway.....

0316069434|5.0|Bosch is back.<br /><br />Four years from the end of his career in in LAPD Harry Bosch  is working cold cases. He arranges to be assigned one that got away-the murder of a Danish photojournalist during the 1992 riots. It is a case that Harry began under the cover of National Guardsmen before being called to the scene of yet another riot related killing. It is a case so cold, so devoid of physical evidence that there is little hope that even Harry can get it closed.<br /><br />Looking for anything to help solve the murder, Harry painstakingly reviews the murder book and begins to see tiny cracks and those openings lead Bosch onwards.His trail takes him to a war zone, and then forwards. Along the  way Bosch to run afoul of his new lieutenant  and use up every favor he was ever owed.<br /><br />Only Michael Connelly writes like this...brilliantly plotted, each page commands your interest. Connelly is clearly America's best living mystery writer. Once you open the Black Box, you won't be able to put it down

B007HACDLK|1.0|The constant repetition of the F and S words, supposedly to show the toughness of Mitch Rapp, reminded me of unruly sophomores in a high school gym. The story itself is convoluted, verbose and often boring, completely unlike Flynn's previous books. Too bad!

B0002F6AZC|4.0|Young Billy is eager to pick up the latest issue of the horror anthology comic book, \\"Creepshow\\", before anyone else in town, and we go along with him for the ride, which also includes an encounter with some bullies and a pit stop to pick up a special delivery ordered from the pages of the comic itself! That's the framing story the Creepshow Creep frequently interrupts to tell 3 new tales of  terror from horror legends Stephen King and George Romero in this 1987 sequel to the 1982 horror classic!<br /><br />Maybe \\"new\\" isn't the perfect term for these stories. They were actually selected from among the rejects of the first Creepshow. The first story is about a general store's wooden Indian chief who avenges the elderly couple he loves when they are done a terrible wrong. The second is about a group of college students who head out to a secluded lake to swim and get wasted on a raft for the day, unaware of a mysterious creature that lurks in, or rather ON the water. Finally, when an adulteress accidentally runs down a hitchhiker on her way home from her gigolo's place, she decides to avoid exposure (and possible jail time) by leaving the scene. This doesn't sit well with the mangled hitchhiker, who absolutely refuses to die without teaching her a well-earned lesson.<br /><br />Yeah, these stories may be leftovers, but they aren't bad, and like the first, if you're a fan of Amicus horror anthologies, you'll appreciate this film just as much. It certainly is not as good as the original film, and there are far fewer stories this time around, but it doesn't fail to entertain. \\"Old Chief Wood'nhead\\" has some very entertaining moments and some noteworthy cast members, even if it's not very scary (in my opinion). There's some debate over which of the other two stories are the highlight of the film, but my money definitely goes to \\"The Raft.\\" \\"The Hitchhiker\\" is probably my least favorite here. I just don't find it that interesting. It might feel the most like an Amicus tale, but not necessarily one of their real winners. \\"The Raft\\" has some cheese to it, and the creature may just be a rip-off of \\"The Blob\\", but this story still manages to be creepy enough to work, and the visuals of the death scenes are unforgettable! Then, there's the wraparound story about Billy, the Creep, and Billy's trip into town. This starts out in live-action (Tom Savini in heavy make-up as the Creep!), but quickly turns into a consistently animated storyline. However, the animation isn't necessarily great. Then again, considering the tight budget of this whole film, I suppose it's pretty good, ha. And, Billy's story is still lots of fun, even if the animation (mainly due to the quality), adds to the general feel of this installment as being, I don't know, a bit more kiddie than the first film (no, I am not at all the type to view animation as being strictly for kids; again, it's largely because of the quality and general style of those sections, not the fact that they are animated; the animation in the first film was very creepy, as I recall).<br /><br />Over all, Creepshow 2 is a fun film to watch, though inferior to its predecessor in many ways. Considering the limitations of this installment though, it does pretty well for itself. I definitely can recommend it to the horror anthology fan. The DVD from Anchor Bay is pretty awesome too! Far better than the release for the original film! It actually comes with bonus features, and good ones! There's a director commentary, two trailers, still galleries, the script on DVD-ROM, and a very nice featurettes on the effects team that brought Creepshow 2 to the screen. Definitely a nice inclusion in a horror film collection, especially for those like myself who really love horror anthology films! And, as a bonus, besides having some great, E.C. Comics inspired cover art, the DVD also comes with an informative insert within the case that includes the great Creepshow 2 Poster art, too, which I assume you could slide into the outer area of the case if you want that to be your cover.<br /><br />Finally, I'll add that there IS a Creepshow 3, but it's not made by the original filmmakers and is generally considered your standard, direct to video schlock of the lowest quality. I can't confirm this though, as I haven't seen it, though I remember seeing bits of it one time online somwhere. If you just can't get satisfied with ONE sequel though, Tom Savini recommends \\"Tales from the Darkside: The Movie\\", which some folks have said is the TRUE Creepshow 3. It's definitely one I recommend too and intend to review very soon. In the meantime, enjoy Creepshow 1 and 2!o the outer area of the case if you want that to be your cover.<br /><br />Finally, I'll add that there IS a Creepshow 3, but it's not made by the original filmmakers and is generally considered your standard, direct to video schlock of the lowest quality.

1611761565|3.0|The book was informative and showed how well-trained troops can respond to changing situations quickly.  However, the author's almost \\"Tea Party-like\\" criticisms of Pres.Obama at the end of the book were inappropriate, unfair, and diminished the author's stature.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Marvelous.  I love this author and the Harry Bosch stories. Thank you Michael Co Nelly. Write many more.  Thank you!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Hopeful & sweet. A light & quick read that I highly recommend to readers of all types looking for a feel good read. Harold Fry is really impressive for a 1st novel or a 5th. Will appeal to all ages. Looking forward to this authors next books!!

B009L32R5I|5.0|Steve does a great job here.  The classics are tweaked a bit, but not enough to stray from the originals.  The only sticking point I had was it was hard not hearing Peter or Phil on lead vocals.  After a second or third listen the vocal arrangements grew on me.  This is worth buying if you are a fan and can't get enough of the classics.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a great game. Tilt controls respond very well. As a FAOTD this is one of the best. I dislike &#34;flying&#34; games but this one would be worth  the regular price.

141659521X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I am a big Vince Flynn fan and happen to have all of his books.  This one, like all the rest, was great.  I can never wait for the next book to come out.  Vince, please write faster.
B002SRQ214|4.0|I'd give this five stars, if not for the piece of junk fan that they send with it. The CPU works great. I haven't overclocked it, but it's already fast, and I've overclocked similar. I'm sure it works great. But why include the piece of junk fan when people will just have to go buy another one anyway. I'd rather they just send the CPU and take the price down a little. The heat sink might be usable, though. I even oiled the bearings on the fan and yet I've STILL heard 5 ton A/C condensers that run quieter. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Update: Definitely a good, robust, stable CPU! I cranked it up to 4GHz and didn't mess around too much with tweaking voltages or anything (left on auto) and it's trucking along with no problem and no heat issues!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is a typical Picoult, full of intrigue and mystery and detail and suspense. The reader assembles the story as it progresses, as the &#34;truth&#34; eventually emerges.  I loved it and highly recommend it to readers who appreciate this kind of fiction.
B0086700CM|5.0|the app is very good  screen resolution also very good.  I would recommend this app to anyone who likes games app.

B001KPYNR0|5.0|as always it did not disapoint. Very soothing to listen to while I work during the day or rather the night( 2-8am)
B009LROCJI|5.0|To be clear this is definitely not for the purists as this departs significantly enough from the originals; however, what a great job it does.  It elevates the original, more serene &#34;elevator&#34; music to emotionally stirring dynamic scores that is quite riviting and imaginitive.  The best music to me is one that illicits emotion from the listener and it does that wonderfully.  I do not see a reason why I would stop listening to the original version since it would be more suited, as mentioned, for a more serence listening experience.  This recomposed version however provides a wonderful new listening experience that I have not found in some time.  I will definitely look for more compositions or re-compositions from this composer.
1419705849|5.0|I purchased two of them  to add to my grandson and granddaughters collection. They love the books and read them over and over.
0316227706|5.0|Vivid images, great variety of breeds, makes a fantastic coffee table book.  Ordered as a bday gift and the receipient loved it.  Party guests loved it, too. I'd recommend it for any dog lover. Shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.
0060254920|5.0|As a kid, I read this book so many times that the pages fell out. Today, I still love this book as much as I did back then.  It's very easy to identify with Max. When he is sent to his room for misbehaving, he comes up with this imaginary world that he runs away to where he can be wild and free, without getting in trouble. He has fun ruling over the wild things and being a wild thing, but at the end of the day he accept his place in the read world.<br />The illustrations in this book are amazing. There are so many details on each page that bring life to the story. Each individual Wild Thing is unique and their personalities are portrayed very well in the illustration.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|Pese a que disfruté mucho la narrativa, estilo y ritmo de la obra, me parece triste que existan contradicciones en la historia general de la franquicia. El juego de Reach nada tiene que ver con esta historia.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book had a lot of twists!  I enjoyed the story line very much. It is one of those books that takes no time to read....you can't put it down.
1118109791|1.0|Received everything ok and on time. Warning: This is not the book to study for GMAT.UNLESS you already have a math AND english degree. The way they explain how they got to the conclusion of each question is missing data that leaves the reader clueless on how the math equation or reading question was reached. I still stuggled through the entire book anyway and I do not feel comfortable enough to take the GMAT so I had to pay $50 to push my date back.
B008X6N1OA|2.0|This is one of those movies where the producer is trying so hard to be politically correct it spoils the film. The cast of black actors ( in voice only of course), bleeds through the animated characters. Instead of enjoying the film all you hear are that stereo typical \\"black speak\\" not quite ebonics but that sassy uppity type speach. It is irritating.<br /><br />I think we need some more white characters especially ones with the distinctive voices of the classic films such as Disney. Very black type voices such as eddie murphy work well as a seasoning. When we see the donkey on shrek we smile in anticipation of knowing that we will hear that mamie type voice.
B00AF614OA|4.0|I was absolutely obsessed with Season 1, and was a little hesitant through the first couple episodes of Season 2. But what can I say? They done good.<br />Not a show for the squeemish, but even so, my friends who don't typically care for the horror genre are eating this series up.<br />Can't get enough - what's better, they're already scheduled for another season!(:
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I really dig the whole retro music that is coming to the masses. I like Lana Del Rey's album because it is reminicent of jazz lounge of yore but mixes in references of the modern times.  Lana seems to have a quirky demeanor in all the video's  and late night shows that I have seen. Unfortunatley, she has already sold out to Target ( if I recall correctly). BUT at least she appeared in the commercial. She has had some other album that came out after this one. Most of the songs are on this album. I dont really care for these types of albums and lower my level of awe. But still love the album. Hope next \\"real\\" one is great, too!
0920236162|5.0|This is a great quest book where the princess gets to save the day, instead of relying on someone else to do it for her.  I try to find books for my daughter that fight the &#34;princess culture&#34; that is marketed to girls now-a-days.  This is a fantastic story of a princess who outsmarts the dragon.  And she does it wearing a paper bag (because he burned up her clothes).
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Fun, easy read , good story line with interesting little twists. will chose DeMille again with John Corey as the reluctant protaganist.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|It was ok, i know most people raved about her, but idk I wanted more from it. The book was better. Maybe it's Hyatt the kind of story better told in words than pictures. I felt they lacked in portraying done of the more emotional moments. I also didn't like that they cut done kinda important details. If the choose to do all 3 books, they will have to back pedal or invent to stay true to story, unless they plan to do more cutting.
006197806X|5.0|Following on from Lauren Oliver's fantastic book `Delirium' here one continues with Lena's struggles as she is tested to the limits, as she stands upon the very edge of a knife. The narrative is spectacular, grabbing your attention instantly so that you are unable to put this book down until the very end. Full of drama, suspense and electric tension you will be hard pressed to find anything comparable to this author's extraordinary writing that has impressed me ever since I encountered her work. The heartbreaking, touching and moving story is one that will melt your heart as it pulls you into the saga hence imbedding itself within your mind for all-time. If you are a fan of romance and want to read novels that explore the true meaning of love then I urge you to discover this wonderful trilogy, which does literally touch your soul with its thought-provoking poignancy, candidness and honesty.<br /><br />Being re-united with the heroine was like coming home, as I delighted in delving once again into Lena's often unpredictable and emotional journey of self-awareness and the inner workings of her heart. The story just gets better and better as there are so many thrills and spills, which capture such feeling and thoughts which are as singular and personal to the author. Due to the author putting herself (metaphorically speaking) into her work and expressing so much, is not only a brave challenge to undertake but which makes this book something great and absorbing to read because of the truth that lies within.<br /><br />Having read Pandemonium I cannot wait to read `Requiem' the third and final installment within this outstanding trilogy, which is something that shall remain at the very top of my bookshelf and which I cannot enthuse about enough. If you love the Young Adult genre, compelling and beautifully written literature and romance that contains such emotion which is not fabricated but so truth-drawing and stunning then you will love Lauren Oliver's work. If I could rate this book any higher than a five star review I would not hesitate in doing so, for it had me awake into the early hours of the morning with chills running down my spine and a hunger to keep reading that was infectious. I can guarantee that this is a book you will definitely be re-reading time & time again!rate this book any higher than a five star review I would not hesitate in doing so, for it had me awake into the early hours of the morning with chills running down my spine and a hunger to keep reading that was infectious.

B009DH2PP4|3.0|I have been doing extract brewing for a year so the first few chapters were skipped over.  The next chapters<br />on water tweaking were beyond my pay grade.  I skipped through many chapters but picked up tips along<br />the way.  I believe I got my monies worth and will consider it a reference book in the future.<br /><br />I read the book on my new Kindle paperwhite, bad choice.  The tables were presented poorly and it did not<br />flow well.  It looked much better on my Ipad One and the paperback would be a much better reference book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of my favorite movies in the last few years! The combination between humor and action was great.<br /><br />The package arrived promptly and it was cheaper than buying it at the store. Great deal!
B0016MJ6HY|3.0|It's just an OK movie.<br />It did not have enough of Nora's music.<br />I would not recommend to anyone.  Boring to me.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|After devouring the entire Rebus series, I never managed to get hooked on Rankin's new character, Fox, in quite the same way so it was refreshing to follow a narrative through Rebus's eyes once again. A great read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It is good to move back to the current time line after the view into Mitch's past in the last couple of books. Vince Flynn mixes enough current events to give this a OMG &#34; how much stuff really goes on behind the screens&#34; feel. I can't wait for the next one! Mr Flynn can take his time to ensure the same quality.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Enough said,  just wish It was a little easier on memory size. Other than that,  it's great.  I am not a teenager, so I didn't text much.  After installing this entering text is very easy.  it very often predicts the next word.  it is also easily customized.
031606792X|5.0|This is my favorite book and I was very happy to find it for such a low price. Thanks so much.
1594481717|5.0|I am realizing the value of using the other side of my brain.  Really appreciate the need for more creativity.
B001BSBBEE|5.0|This is one of my more favorite horror movies. The plotline is terrific, especially in this day and age where everything is becoming a remake/reboot. The atmosphere is spot on and the music is perfect; the acting is a bit on the cheesy side, but does not ruin from the film. I would recommend this to any horror afficianado or those who enjoy Twilight Zone-esque endings.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|The game worked fine and the graphics were good. I just did not like the game itself.  I prefer angry birds more. I would rather sling birds than build contraptions.
0525953728|5.0|I'm delighted that this man had the courage to tell it like it is. The American people need to know if they are brave enough to read it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like Mahjong and have payed alot for ones to play on my computer. I know this one is free but it is fun and interesting to play. If you like Mahjong or even if you have never played you should give this game a try.
B0017HEX76|1.0|The package arrived and Korean was the primary language!  I know the movie has few words, but there was no mention of it in the ad and no way to return it.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|I don't ever leave reviews but honestly I've never felt this way after reading a book.  I watched Forks over Knives, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, Supersize Me, Engine 2 Diet and countless other health documentaries.  I've read The China Study and tons of other health books, but for some reason this just tied it all together for me.  I'm 32, never been overweight (180-200 @ 6'2\\") people call me skinny (those that haven't seen my gut), but I do have the typical high BP and high cholesterol that come from eating the typical \\"western\\" diet.<br /><br />In about a week without meat and basically no dairy (very little cheese) my BP is down to under normal levels and the brain fog is gone.  I feel more rested, more focused, more productive, less achy, no more lightheadedness, I can breathe better, it's crazy!  I'm curious if my cholesterol levels will improve at my next doctor visit (can't imagine why they wouldn't) something that hasn't improved in 10 years even with gym training or cardio.  The gut is slowly fading, and my weight has remained basically the same, so either I'm losing fat, gas, water, or all the above, unlikely that any muscle is wasting because I don't feel a slight bit weaker.  Whatever it is my body is beginning to like me again, and I can't wait to see what a year on this program could do.<br /><br />Do your body a favor and read this book today, like right now!
B0001I561E|2.0|The DVD has skipped since day 1. Had I not thrown away the slip, I would have sent it back. You can't watch the whole movie. If there's a way I can replace it, please let me know.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|As much as I loved Series One, I may love Series Two even more.<br />Modern Sherlock returns with new cases, new antagonists, and the same witty writing. I adore the clever dialogue and the sincere heart that runs through this series, and I think Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch have such endearing chemistry as Holmes and Watson. I would watch forty more years of Sherlock.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Got it for my Kindle Fire 2nd Gen.  First file manager app, chose it because originally I wanted something to copy files from my PC to the Kindle over WiFi.  This does that by allowing the tablet/phone access shared folders over the LAN, just scan and it comes up.  Additionally whenever I needed something to find and manage files (videos, .apk files...) 'under the hood' of the Amazon interface I open this up.  Other things I've used it for is installing .apk's and backing up apps.  I'm sure I've only touched the surface of what this app can do!
B004132HZS|5.0|Seriously, I love it so much.<br />It's clever, funny, sexy...I'm always bugging my friends to watch it. The writing is brilliant, the acting and chemistry is fantastic, you really can't go wrong. It's a fun update on a well-loved classic, and is gaining a cult-following of its own.
0547884591|5.0|There are so many elements to this book that it is almost impossible to do justice in a short review.  If you like to learn and learn fast (and not just cooking) then this book is for you!  Just a hundred or so pages in, I've already started implementing and using the great tips, suggestions and ideas!  I just ordered several more copies for Christmas gifts.  Don't miss out!
0451450523|5.0|I grew up watching the movie, and picked up the book to compare.<br />Peter S. Beagle's prose blew me away. He uses the most gorgeous, enchanting descriptions without losing pace, and is the most cliche-free writer I've ever encountered. This book is older than me by a decade, and yet comes across so fresh and new, you feel as though you're witnessing a miracle. I recommend this book for anyone who loves fantasy, and especially for anyone who wants to write fantasy. Peter S. Beagle is the man to learn from.
B009O2XY12|2.0|cannot play due to force closings. ive reinstalled several time and have been unable to play.  maybe it will work for you.
B005XI94HY|5.0|This album is a knockout. Every single track is gorgeous and fascinating, you simply cannot go wrong with this purchase.
B0092W2GSG|5.0|This is one of those collections I can put on, no matter what my mood, and enjoy from start to finish. There isn't a mis-step anywhere on here. I would highly recommend this (and have) to anyone who loves and internalizes music.
0061450162|4.0|I'm a Neil Gaiman fan, so this collection was pure fun to read. Some of the offerings fell short of what I've grown to expect from Gaiman, but I understand that they can't all be gems, and that different people appreciate different kinds of stories. I did enjoy it well enough to lend to several friends, and it's a good choice to curl up by the fire with.
B00280LYIC|3.0|I saw the movie two years ago. Reading the book, I felt that it<br />was on the verge of being a different story entirely than the plot I watched unfold in the movie. For being an adolescent geared book, I thought it was wonderfully written.
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|I was expecting more of a strong album, but I was not disappointed.  I like and love a lot of the songs on here, but I'm not going to claim it's my favorite CD of theirs.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I think there is such a thing as too much filler on this album. Jack Douglas is a great producer, however I don't want to hear his introduction on LuvXXX every time I listen to the album. The same can be said for the intro to Street Jesus. Too many ballads, especially Diane Warren's Another Last goodbye. All in all an ok album. Not great, not what I would have expected, but ok.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|...and I totally love it so far! There are so many good, wonderful songs in this album. So far, my favorites are \\"Cloud Nine\\", \\"That's What it Takes\\", \\"When We Was Fab\\", \\"Breath Away From Heaven\\", and of course, \\"I've Got My Mind Set on You\\". Amongst the additional tracks, Shanghai Surprise is my favorite (I find myself listening to this song over and over again). All in all, I absolutely love this album, and I love George. This is wonderful. Great job, George!

034580404X|5.0|I was not familiar with the dom/sub lifestyle, so I enjoyed learning about it thru the books.  I enjoyed the way the author chose her characters and their interacttion.<br />The only thing I missed what no allusion to religion except for the crisis prayers.  I expecially liked the ending of book 3, a nice ribbon on the package with insights into how things came out in time.
B004F1F32A|5.0|The action starts early and keeps going throughout the movie. This is a relatively short movie (1.5 hrs), and the premise is a bit far fetched, but it is a lot of fun.  If you are looking for subplots or witty dialogue, then this is not for you, but if you want to see exciting action sequences then watch this movie.
B007HJ91HU|2.0|Typical poor remake of a good thing.  Felt that it actually undermind and belittle the original movie which was excellent.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have to admit that I am addicted to Downton Abbey.  It took hold of me in Episode 1, Season 1 and has continued.  Of course, I will admit that I was a history major.  Downton Abbey is one of those well written pieces that does not alter history and reports it in a palatable manner easy for the non history lover to digest, an art developed by Mitchner.  I undertand that American television, NBC I think, has hired the DA writer to put together a similar saga based in early 1900s New York.  If that interests you, you might want to watch The Age Innocence, starring Daniel Day Lewis and based on the book by Edith Wharton.
B007URCTOG|5.0|Restores your belief in everlasting love.  This was a wonderful story of faith and the power of love.  In this day and age, an inspiration that real love still exists.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Classic!  My hubby and I will always love this movie and my little one will be watching this soon!  :)
B0088WGBC8|5.0|Ryan Reynolds does and excellent job in this roll.  Shows he knows more than just comedy.  This was an excellent suspense film and would recommend it to anyone who loves Ryan Reynolds.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This simple game will challenge you as you go up the levels. I like improving my mind and this will keep you guessing.
B009329Y30|5.0|Zac Efron shows he is more than a teenage heart throb.  This was a superb film and Efron did a vantastic portrail of his character.  This is a keeper.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|This was a pretty thing that I thought I'd enjoy having on my kindle but the music was so soft I couldn't hear it so I ended up removing it.
B008578PRK|5.0|On the level of the old Hitchcock nail biters.  Daniel Radcliffe did a superb job of keeping you on your seat (and out of your seat) the entire film.  Wonderful suspense without all the blood and gore.  Really makes your mind work which makes the movie even better.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|A beautiful collection piece for a beautiful movie.<br /><br />Lots of special features and extra scenes. Really more than I needed, but as a new BLu ray player owner, i just had to have it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|great game for kindle fire hd. fun mini games. alot different from the story line. build and defend ur own town.
B000PMG16U|5.0|It was a good purchase. I love the movies and the quality of the sound and video.  Sorry, I don't remember the price.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Because I like when a plan comes together. And this movie had all the old players/ rough necks. Great Action
0307408833|3.0|First before you purchase this book buy the babycakes 2012 app instead or before. It explains so much. Everything makes so much more sense.<br />I bought this book when it first came  out. I was interested mainly on the vegan somewhat healthy solutions to sweets.<br />After I failed at 2 or perhaps 3 recipes I put the book on the shelf up until now (2yrs later ?).<br />I bought the app again because of my interest and yes everything made more sense. So I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Now for some odd reason in regards to her pie  crust recipe in the app and the book are the same. However when she does the sample video she uses completely different recipes.<br /><br />The pie crust on her video is actually gluten free. But the pie crust in both recipes are using spelt flour. Weird. I don't care about gluten it doesn't bother me (I don't think). In fact I love spelt. But I really wanted that very expensive recipe on her video. I found that strange. Well when I tried her recipe from both options (which were the same recipes)  It did not work. Basically my crust fell apart. So I ended up freezing it for a future crumb cake. I added a few extra ingredients and it actually worked out nicely for my vegan crumb cake I made today. A recipe I got online. The ingredients are way too expensive to just trash.<br /><br />Anyway I have to say I made donuts and it really came out great. But again from her app recipe (not sure if its the same as the book). I made muffins I sort of made it into my own recipe fyi she uses way too much cinnamon so cut down to even 1/2 tablespoon. It was a cinnamon apple muffin recipe from her book but the cinnamon was over powering. The texture however was really amazing. I was surprised and pleased and we ate them up.<br /><br />I did try her chocolate chip cookies. I did what she said on her video press down and well they  became flat flat cookies. But still pretty good.<br />I had froze half the batch and the other day we made some and instead I made round balls no smashing and they actually came out how they were suppose to be.<br />Crispy on the outside and nice and soft in the inside.<br /><br />I believe there are a few or more than a few typos and she does correct herself on her app at least.<br />I do plan to experiment more, I have not tried her frosting yet. I can't find rice milk powder. I even had my sister look at all the health food stores in Manhattan and no luck.<br />I bought the soy powder but I am hearing a lot of complaints of an after taste. So I am reluctant to try this since everything is so expensive.<br />Also I did notice her correcting her mistake on Martha Stewart as well I think with the milk measurements. So still like this book for my collection and I am finally using it. If you like experimenting with somewhat healthier vegan bake goods and you can get this book for a good deal then try it. But get the app too. Or just get the app and save a few bucks..<br /><br />She does seem really nice and my sister had her bake goods and loved everything she tried. I haven't gone to the bakery yet.<br /><br />Just an update since again I am trying out recipes from this book:<br /><br />I tried the freaking frosting (I was very reluctant). Well the taste was disappointing. Certainly not magic!<br />It's setting in the refrigerator now. I followed her recipe in the book. DON\\"T!!!!!!<br />It was my fault for not taking a look at her app before to see if the recipe matches.<br />Don't bother spending 8 bucks on coconut flour. You don't need it.<br />So what the hell, here is the recipe for those who don't want to buy the app or anything by this person...<br />Sorry babycake baking lady.<br />But I just wasted 8 bucks. You could have mention why you changed the recipe in the freaking app.<br /><br />1c unsweetened coconut milk (she doesn't specify canned or carton, figures!)<br />1 1/4 c of dry rice or soy milk powder<br />1/3 c agave nectar<br />1 tbls vanilla extract<br />1 3/4 melted coconutoil (she doesn't say neutral)<br />1 tbls lemon juice<br />follow the mixing instruction  in the book.<br /><br />As far as finding rice milk powder, prob will have to order it online for like 26 bucks.<br />With the soy milk powder, the frosting came out gritty. People complained of the taste. The taste is just bland and yellow.<br />Not very exciting at all. Compare to her app video the her texture looked like frosting even unset. Mine looked like a yellow ugly liquid mess (I followed her recipe exact).<br />I am still waiting for it to set though.<br /><br />I am trying to make a birthday cake for my sister, but I think I will use instead coconut fat from the coconut milk (canned)<br />or \\"healthy top\\". I don't want that coconut flavor but if in her new recipe she uses coconut milk then it will have a similar taste. Plus canned coconut is so much cheaper.<br />Go online and take a look at that simple cheap recipe.<br /><br />[...]
B007HACDLK|5.0|This one of his best. I loved it. Mitch is at his best wisecracking, threatening role to date.  We need a real life character like him in our government.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The only reason I purchased this was to watch it instantly on the episodes that I could not get from Comcast On Demand because they were not available and I could not find them on AMC's website to watch instantly. I will purchase again if I come across this issue in the future and have to. Great quality, not too expensive, and now I'm caught up with the Zombie apocolypse. :) Thank you Amazon
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Fairly good story-line but not sparkling.  The historical events were for the most part accurate but politicized. I mean by that Mr. Follett chose to emphasize some facts more than others, giving an interpretation which favored the Labor Party over any other party.  Of course I do not include the Fascist party in this assessment.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|Its just a funny movie, everyday life gets boring and a crazy scam goes wrong and its epic must see!!!

B008NB0SQO|5.0|Received the blu ray of \\"Muppet Christmas Carol\\" and am perfectly pleased with it.<br /><br />It is just as it is supposed to be; this is the 20th Anniversary blu ray edition of the THEATRICAL release...therefore, the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" is not included. Why would it be? The song was NOT IN the theatrical release (it was cut prior to the film being released in theaters), so it does not belong in the 20th Anniversary blu ray. The song was added to some home video releases at a later time, so it does not belong on this release.<br /><br />The transfer is fantastic...both sound and picture are a very welcome upgrade from the DVD release. This is the best I have seen this film since seeing it (multiple times) in the theater. Stray hairs can be spotted, stitching in costumes, the texture of the Muppets, it's all here in glorious high def. And I absolutely LOVE the surprises when the film is \\"paused\\"...Wonderful..!!!!<br /><br />People who choose not to purchase this because of a missing song are truly missing out...this film is so much more than one song that wasn't even in the theatrical release. I will be placing my DVD that has the song in a sleeve and putting it in with the beautiful blu ray. The blu ray will be my preferred viewing source, but should I ever want to see the non-theatrical release with the song, I will have it handy.
B004JMZPJG|4.0|Cheap but works well. I deduct 1 point since it's a little bit large for my Nikon D3100. The producer should figure out the inner size very clearly.
B004I744AS|5.0|Does everything can reasonably expect from a dictionary app. Plus games. Also the foreign language translations are neat. Amazing app considering it's free.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is convienet; easy to understand; and a very useful tool. It has a lot of different devotions for any one 's situation. This app makes it easy and exciting to read the Bible daily.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas present, so haven't opened it but is the CD wife was looking for.  Thanks!
B00513DGIO|5.0|The thing about Debt: The First 5,000 Years that I love is how informed the author is. This book is a concise, dense encyclopedia about debt. I learned a lot. And, honestly, the world makes more sense now that I've read it. There are practical reasons that things happen they way they do in society. This book explains a lot of those reasons.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|greatly fun but if u wish to continue without wait for new levels you need to buy more for $2 but its wort it
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|What were they thinking? What a waste. I feel sorry for the people that were involved in its production. That is really all I have to say.
0006748287|2.0|I did not care for this book, it reminded me of the strange story of The Hunger Games.  I prefer books that are more realistic.
B0071AKB38|5.0|It's small enough to transport in my purse.  I use it for my iphone and my ipad.  (both those devices do not have very good internal speakers if you are in an open area)  You can either use bluetooth or use the wire that is connected to speaker.  I have used it for a telecon too with my iphone.  I did get a comment that it produces feedback if you do not mute your phone and someone else is talking.  (that happens with speakerphones in general though)  I definitely recommend this to augment the sound from your small devices.
B000PC8AFU|5.0|My wife LOVES S R V and this is on apar with all of his previous works and a joy
B006LSZECO|1.0|Horrible!  Starts out ok.  Great writing?  How about the F-word on every page? This is a downer book with no redemptive quality.  All the characters are evil with no positive turn around.  The ending is horrible.  I would not recommend this book to anyone and I don't know how it's been on every best seller list.  I'm glad I downloaded it from the library and didn't buy it.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|love the Birds and all their variations. Not a gamer so simple nad fun is the key for me. good diversion

0670026182|5.0|I stumbled on this book's blog over a year ago and put it in my favorites! I love her recipes and the flavor. It's a nice starting point for my own creative juices to start off. The flavors are fantastic! I'm also not ashamed to admit that the food photography is beautiful, I believe that helps when thinking of what to have for dinner! Great job! Keep it coming.<br />Michelle from Bucks County PA
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful!!! I was hooked from beginning to the end. Definitely can't wait to watch the movie and read the two other books!! Two thumbs up.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|The Godfather is an amazing story that survives through the years. It'll never be outdated! I've watched the movie only a few  weeks ago and after that I decided to buy the book. I'm not repented! The book contains incredible details that make the story even better.<br />I strongly recommend the book!
B005LAIHSG|1.0|there is not much to talk about. hardly anything happens in the movie. it could have been trimmed down to a half hour movie. it seems while watching the movie that all they wanted to do was show visual effects. and even then its boring and uninteresting.<br /><br />how this movie made any money at all. let alone nearly 400 million dollars is beyond me. half the people that went to see it must have slept through it. i am very anti stewart. but any twilight movie has to be better than this.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|After meeting Colleen on a cruise and learning about her book, I had to read it. I'm hooked! This book was very sweet, romantic, and emotionally charged! Already starting her second book!
0446530573|5.0|I actually purchased for my vintage, collectible cookbook collection and was amazed to find there are really some awesome recipes in here!
B0034G4P94|5.0|Tom Hardy is phenomenal in this movie!  It is about family and having the strength to forgive and love again.  I recommend this movie!!
1608871452|5.0|This book is underpriced. Truly. It is a steal for the treasure trove of information, the big, beautiful pictures, and the wonderful little treasures within, such as removable stickers, poster and maps. Lots of detailed pictures and concept designs for many of the weapons and props from the show, interviews with the actors and staff, a wonderful tribute to Kim Manners and much more. This is a must have for the hard core Supernatural fan.
B0096Y6EUG|5.0|Just as good as I thought it would be.  Great driving music.  For $3.99 you cant beat this deal.  Paul simon is terrific.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|A trip back in time more entertaining than many current computer and action driven films. Nail biting conclusion. And not one of the apartments viewed through Jimmy Stewart's &#34;rear window&#34; had a television. Take a break from our hyper-wired and networked society and spend a couple of hours with a stunning Grace Kelley (cosmetic tweaking and enhancement-free) and an endearing Jimmy Stewart as they unravel a murder.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me reading late into the night.  I love to solve the story and this one kept me guessing until the end.
0930289528|3.0|The comic is not exactly as the movie, so even if you have seen the movie, it is nice to read it. The quality of the paper made it almost impossible to read, as well as the coloring of the images. I liked the story. I would not buy it again at this paper quality, but I would buy it at a good one.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Any Twihard fan will tell you it is important to have the dvds! This was great entertainment and I am waiting to buy the Part 2 Dvd when it is released.
1401216676|3.0|Nice design and good paper quality but I had not read a batman before, and this way of writing is too miserable for my appetite.
B0098460O4|4.0|The music is surprisingly unique and enjoyable. His classic operatic approach to the compositions and her clear pop tone are not only harmonious but they also create a new spin to the collective song choices. Very nice, with adding to the collection.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As soon as I found out that The Last Man was a Mitch Rapp book I had to have it.  It did not disappoint.  The story was made believable and up to date by Mr. Flynn's inclusion of the Pakistani's attitude about the Bin Laden kill.
B009RX8AQW|5.0|Pure entertainment, intriguing and there is enough there to keep your interest. Definitely a cult type program, may not have a broad appeal however if you like fantasy and fairy tail although campy at times can definitely be nostalgic. I just love this kind of stuff so I may not be the best critic. I give it a thumbs up, worth purchasing!!
0786956291|5.0|I purchased this for my husband, but my kids also use it. My kids are ages 12, 14 & 15 so this set it perfect for teen and adults. It in well written so that it's easy to understand.
B003K5ZQGU|3.0|I didn't know much about Queen Victoria's story prior to seeing this movie, so I was a little disappointed by the actual story.  Coming into the movie, I was expecting an Elizabeth-like story, where a female ruler helps set England on the right path.  That was anything but the case.  Instead, I found Victoria to be a bit of a weak character and it made it hard for me to really enjoy the story.  As well, the plot was a bit slow and a little boring as there was very little action throughout the movie.
B007V65R54|5.0|It's hard to overstate the importance of knowing what will happen in the future with just a little more clarity. This book has the potential to affect every decision you will make for the rest of your life.
B007SSEBCU|2.0|The only reason to watch this movie is because Meryl Streep puts on another amazing performance.  Brilliant as always, if you are a fan of her as an actress you will enjoy seeing her fully become the character.  The reason I rate the movie lowly though, as I am a big fan of Margaret Thatcher and I thought this movie sold her short.  Thatcher became powerful when politics was still really an old boys club and policies helped to steer England on a successful course.  Unfortunately, the director probably isn't an conservative and therefore steers away from any positive portrayal of her ideas.  Therefore, Thatcher comes across as kind of weak as you don't really see all that she accomplished.  Without the policies playing more of a central role, the movie just felt flat.
B002POVIMS|4.0|I have been listening to this for a few months now and find that I return back once or twice a week still. The tracks on the front third of the album are what I particularly like with the remaining sort of blending together.<br /><br />Most of the music I purchase is used during workouts to provide you with an idea of what I am looking for.<br /><br />Check it out!
0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis is a master at combining information with intriguing stories centered around real people, so that you feel like you are reading a story instead of a history book.  Lewis' recent books-turned-movies Moneyball and Blind Side have led people to forget that he initially came from the world of high finance which he exposed in Liar's Poker.  Once a wall street insider, Lewis returns to the world of high risk-high rewards and displays to you the crazy world of finance.<br /><br />Confused about what led to the Financial Meltdown?  After reading Lewis you'll understand how the financial industry was able to make fools of those who came up with the ratings. As well, you'll see how some really smart individuals called out that the system was a house of cards ready to fall, but no one was willing to listen.  Instead, those same individuals and their clients benefited from predicting that fall.<br /><br />Witty and fast-paced, this book is a great read.  You don't have to know anything about junk bonds, housing markets or bonds to enjoy this book.  Instead, Lewis explains everything in such a way that you end up feeling like a market insider.<br /><br />Sick of dry renditions on where we went wrong?  Then pick up this book and blow through it.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Hip hop fans need to check this out. Macklmore & Ryan Lewis have done something I haven't heard in a long time. Faintly reminiscent of a Tribe Called Quest.
B000056HE9|1.0|Don't buy this copy! It is a great Movie but MGM printed it with 2 burn spots that ruin the movie.<br />My VHS copy is in better shape than that!!
0547884591|2.0|I would say I am a Tim Ferris fan, having previously enjoyed both 4HWW and 4HB.  After following Tim's blog for many years, I guess I was full of expectations for this book and so far am very disappointed...<br /><br />Specifically:<br /><br /> - As a reader of Tim's blog, a lot of material used in the book had already been covered on the blog: from the broad topics, to the specific examples used / stories told to illustrate the points<br /><br /> - Given the focus in the book on the importance of sequencing when learning new skills, I found the sequencing of the book (particularly early on) less than ideal.  This made a lot of the concepts harder to follow than necessary.  I saw one review that described Tim's writing style as manic.  I would have to agree.  Perhaps why the topics / example work better (for me) as a blog...?<br /><br /> - I don't think the cooking manual section of the book should have been included in this book.  I know he is using cooking as a vehicle to describe how to learn new skills, but for me the cooking section should have been a separate book.

B000O59AFC|2.0|The movie itself is great, but the blu ray isn't very good.  It is quite grainy in some scenes and you can clearly see imperfections of the film in certain shots.  I have some DVDs that look equally good when &#34;upscaled&#34; in my Panasonic BDT210...  Long story short, I doubt most people would see a difference from the DVD version for a fraction of the  cost.

B0080JE49Q|3.0|On the one hand, I like this cd. \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" has actually never been one of my favourite, but it's nice to finally have a cd version with the spoken intro (I just got it on my vinyl so far). I love \\"Don't Be Messin' `Round\\", it's a very catchy, fresh tune and you nearly forget it's unfinished when you listen to it.<br /><br />But on the other hand, it's frustrating, because, come to think of it, you just get the spoken intro on this cd. Both \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" (but without intro) and \\"Don't Be Messin' `Round\\" (exactly the same version) are on the \\"Bad 25\\" cd. So... isn't it a bit like cheating?
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I wish there was an easier way to reach things... like a main page where you can click on notes or calendar.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game because if ur board u just play flow and ur not board anymore so to any of u who need a fun game I suggest this one and there are some other good games that I suggest angry birds and other entertaining games like that so get this game I dealt like it
B008KGPEQG|3.0|Beautifully writen but quite uneven in interst. Memoirs usually are. Has some very moving chapters, I adored his norweigean family, but others quite boring, at least for a foreign reader who has never experienced the taste of American sweets! I was enjoyable and easy to read, though, even it it's not what I try to find in literature.
B004N6369Y|4.0|I didn't want this story to end. Kept my interest all the way through.  Felt I would like to attend this hotel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was amazing! I didn't ever want to put it down.<br />However, the end really let me down. It just kind of fizzled out during the last couple chapters. I was expecting something way more than what I got there.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I will use my dives to film fishing sub. I hope to make great images of the aquatic world. GREAT .....
B004NEY9EW|1.0|I thought i was purchasing an actual dvd... was purcahsing as a gift... tried to cancel no where would it let me.very disappointed

B003M8NG94|5.0|The 1st one never made it to my POBox. I reordered it and now it comes here DEFECTIVE! it has all the sounds but NO VOICE! Then when I try to exchange it I am asked to pay the return postage!<br />Update: I finally did get this item delivered in working order and a return label was also emailed to me. I'm happy now.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|This is not my favorite cd. I'm used to the older music and this is not the same Steven Tyler I'm use to listening to. I like the older Music from Aerosmith. He did the country song and I do not like country at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book to read. It kept my interest through every page. Can't wait to read book 2.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I have seen the film before and got the dvd as a Christmas gift for my father. The package arrived in plenty of time for the holiday.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I was skeptical, because I had heard bad reviews, but I thought it was a good movie!  Was bummed when it was over!
044654759X|5.0|I have every Nicholas Sparks book so far and this one was just as great as the others. It was a wonderful addition to my growing Nicholas Sparks collection!!!
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Why did they create this film about an important statesman from the point of view of her senility?<br />The performance of Meryl Streep was very good but the part was so baffling that i do not know what it was in aid of.<br />Also, it would be nice if the author had made clearer if the woman was just power hungry or believed in her cause.  I found it quite unclear.  This was one of those films where i would like to ask for my money back when it was over.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is probably one of the best apps I've purchased. It updates quite frequently, which adds more games to the app, so there are tons of hours of entertainment with just this one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read the trade paperback version of this book and loved it!  It was so good, I passed my copy on to my daughter, grandson and granddaughter to read - but this is one I would probably want to read again, so I am buying the Kindle version.  It is sad, happy, inspiring, funny and heartbreaking all in turns.  I absolutely loved Enzo and his human.  One of the  most heartwarming stories I've read in a very long time - highly recommend it!
B003L77GH4|5.0|I absolutely love the TV series. Having the series on DVD so I can watch it whenever I want is absolutely fantastic. The extras on the DVDs are great, too!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book I really enjoyed it.  It was very interesting I really enjoy sci-fi books but the descriptions in this book were amazing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game! Some of the levels are difficult, but that just makes it more fun because then I get to have other people help me. I found out it can be a two or three person game.
0345803485|1.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started this book after hearing about all the hype for months and months and months, but quite honestly, I did not expect it to read like a raunchy fanfic of the Twilight characters.  By making that comparison I have to confess that I have read Twilight fan-fiction, including many stories of graphic sexual accounts no doubt written by young women caught up in the phenomenon that is Twilight.  It also occurred to me that I might actually be reading a story from Stephanie Myers herself,given the lack of depth in the characters and their tendency to \\"roll their eyes\\"; her inability to express annoyance, disbelief or impatience in any other way then this physical expression, a signature phrase used through the Twilight series. E.L. James from West London, married to a TV executive with two children sounds like a pen name and a fictional biography if I ever heard one. But alas, that theory went out the window with all the British slang included in this book.  Why this story wasn't set in London is beyond me, given that the setting was irrelevant; would that take it too far away from the land of Twilight for the author to relate too? But I digress....<br /><br />Assuming Christian Grey, the handsome twenty something billionaire is not Edward Cullen, and Anastasia Steele (who likes to be called Ana) is not Isabella Swan (who likes to be called Bella); and Elliot is not Emmett and Katherine is not Rosalie, and ADOPTIVE parents(dad) Carrick is not Carlisle and (mom) DOCTOR Grace is not Esme and little sister, the very enthusiastic Mia is not Alice, you can't blame me for thinking that this story sounds very very familiar.  The only one missing is Jasper, but maybe he shows up in later books.<br /><br />Why is all that relevant to this review, well if you've read Twilight then you will know what you are getting your self into, because this story just reads like a sexed up version of that series of books. As I previously mentioned, thecharacters are extremely shallow and under developed; stereotypical, especially our little innocent Ana, who despite being a recent college graduate and so beautiful that the ultra rich, incredibly good looking Grey falls for her after one meeting, is a virgin that barely can find her way around a bedroom.  And just like our pefect little Bella, Ana is also the perfect daughter and friend and girlfriend/sex slave and she gives the best head on the very first try!<br /><br />So ladies, particularly, if you enjoy this kind of story, you will find plenty of it on the internet and its all free. You can probably skip buying it in the form of a book.
B0028OA4CK|5.0|This season was wonderful! I didn't think I would like Catherine Tate with David Tennant after the great on-screen chemistry between him and Billie Piper. However, it proved me wrong!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got this game and now I can't leave it alone! It's challenging the more times you complete it but it does glitch frustratingly often. The music is pleasant and the graphics are ok. Pretty good time killer.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is a wonderful Christmas movie for all ages. It has become a sort of family tradition at Christmas to watch this movie at least once. Mara Wilson is absolutely fantastic.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Although I had gotten quite far in the game, it began to get repetitive. Then, as if that wasn't enough, when I had but a few more stars to go, ALL of my saved progress had disappeared. Naturally, this discouraged me from playing any further and making me quite furious at the game.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. It's an adorable movie, too. The only thing is, it has some spots where voodoo is involved, which may be a little scary for younger children. However, overall the movie is really cute and the songs are fantastic!
B0097S0TM0|5.0|I really enjoy this compilation. I made sure to download the &#34;clean&#34; version because I love turning the music up and my kids love to sing along. I recommend this to all of Pink's fans. You will not be disappointed. I liked that this album had a variety of different types of songs. Some upbeat, soulful, rock, etc. for a variety of flavor.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love this show and since some of my Doctor Who loving friends don't get BBC America, this set is a wonderful addition to my collection.
B00004U8P9|5.0|This version is great for RHPS fans. It includes a lot of bonus material & a couple different versions of the movie.
0439813786|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I love how it is made up of beautiful pictures that tell the story right along with the words. It's a wonderful story!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Outstanding book, time is finally explained and the journey the author takes you through is very relaxing and thought provoking. I found myself not wanting to put the book down until the end.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I was so excited when the TV series came out because I was already a fan of the books. The TV series didn't disappoint, either. It's a great series!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Love the CD.  Listen to it through and through first time.  Gone, Gone, Gone I think replaces Home as my favorite.  My 2 year old has enjoyed the CD and since she first heard Home referred to it as &#34;the good song&#34;!!
B009EAO38C|5.0|I love these guys. Their music is absolutly enchanting and I can't stop listening no matterwhat they're playing. I can't wait for their next album.
B002ZG97LK|1.0|This was a terrible remake.  Still don't understand why they did it.  When she got hit by Chuck I'm sorry I couldn't stop laughing it was such horrible acting the fake body crying was just to funny not to laugh.  Its mean yes but its one of those movies I wish I could un see.
B00000342V|5.0|Curtis may be gone, but certainly not forgotten, great music from the past and brings you music for the present. It never gets old for sure.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|While his story line is somewhat different this time, it is none the less brillant. Enjoy the read. You won't be able to put your kindle down. Always hate myself for reading the book too fast and then it's over
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am a history teacher and and have a graduate degree in history.  I don't like horror or supernatural stuff.  I'm not  fan of anything King has done in the last 15-20 years.  That being said this book was amazing, maybe the best book of this length I've ever read.  Never mowed through a 900 pager this quickly, I was truly saddened when it was over, I felt like I had lost a part of me.  Meticulously researched, beautifully written.  An engaging love story that was real, authentic, relate-able and non-gratuitous, woven into a historical narrative.  If you've ever wanted to go back to this time but can't because your DeLorean is in the shop, this book will do it.  I really felt like I was there.  The protagonist was someone everyone could relate to in some way, a very typical, reasonable fella from 2011 who acts and behaves and transforms in a way I think all of us can identify with.  Some people have said it is a little slow, but I couldn't get enough.
B005XN31LY|2.0|even though it is set in a fairytale genere, I feel like the relationships between the characters is fake and forced.  Rumplstiltskin is genuine and believable evil.  The others are tiresome.  I wish they weren't.  I wish I liked this show.  It has everything going for it... and yet, it misses the authentic struggle to make it truly great.  Merlin is an example of how silly premises can still hold real emotional value.  Those characters are connecting in an authentic way.  Maybe Once Upon A Time will get better in time.  Merlin did.
B00973902K|5.0|Got for my 7 yr old daughter - if it wasn't for Christmas music taking over I'd still be hearing non-stop in the car!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This was a great piece of historical fiction. It was fast reading and easy to get wrapped up in this story. Stephen King did a masterful job of putting you in the time period. It was a lot of fun trying to conclude how history would have changed if Kennedy was not assassinated.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game to shoot coins enjoy it eminsley have for phone and for kindle would recommend to everyone to try
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Will only load half a page, then loads half *ssed, then quits loading.  I am very upset with this. Fix it please.
0062202081|5.0|very good , im not read its a gift to my sister i hope like it , the material looks good
6304708483|5.0|This is a fun movie. This version has great sound, and includes some bits that I didn't notice with other versions (e.g., whatever version Palladium features). We watch this with kids. It is one of my 5 year son's favorites.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great holiday movie!  My family watched this movie when I was little and it was always one of my favorites!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My absolute favorite show :-) there will never be a cast like this one in my life time! Very excited
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Super!!! Este Cd supera a los anteriores. Excelentes canciones, sonido impecable y las letras cargadas de sentimientos. El mejor regalo para estas Navidades.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Great continuation of the plot from the prequel and the first season.  It is odd to see Spartacus being acted by another actor at first but you get over it.  Season ended well, can't wait to start watching the next season beginning in Jan 2013.
1449410243|5.0|This book doesn't disappoint, it's funny, interesting and well put together.  The poster insert is the best. If they come out with another book in this series we will definitely be purchasing it.
B00956UPSW|3.0|nothing much going on. same old rehashed licks, nothing exciting. I'll give it a few more plays but I miss the NOLA days.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|this is the second counterfeit LifeProof case we've received in a week for our kids Christmas gift of iphones - now will be buying directly from LifeProof
B009ZTLPJM|4.0|on the 1st listen I was unimpressed. by the 4th it had grown on me and now I can say I really like this album. nice job
B00A8ECU24|2.0|was hopping the game would be good for my 5 year old but to easy to hard to play for her without buying coins or gems and they are not cheapness
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a fan of the walking dead and I can't get enough of it...my son even love's watching the show!!!
0316212377|3.0|I haven't read a sci-fi book this entertaining and witty in a long time.  It started off a little slow but built very quickly and maintained its pace throughout the entire book, something I always have a problem with when reading other sci-fi books.  The characters, which were mainly ships and avatars, were very cool and the story very well written.  It really had the right combination of everything.<br /><br />HOWEVER, let's talk about that ending.  I am continually frustrated by sci-fi endings, doesn't matter who the author is (except maybe Arthur C. Clarke).  Most sci-fi writers, for whatever reason, always tend to rush the ending without providing any real solid conclusions to anything, and this book was no exception.<br /><br />I mean the entire emphasis of this book (including how the chapters are designated) was the so-called Subliming.  This concept was very, very interesting to me and I couldn't wait to read more about what actually happened when the Gzilt civ Sublimed.  But this was never addressed!!  In the end, they just went into the void, left a few people behind, and the \\"secret\\" was ultimately never even told to the Gzilt even though an incredible amount of energy was spent trying to uncover it!  There is no description whatsoever about what the Sublime actually is, how it feels to be in there, how people can come out of it, etc.  Nothing.<br /><br />So, while this book was entertaining right up until the end, all of it was ultimately pointless and anti-climactic as to the Subliming and secret everybody was after.  Sorry.  Would have given it 5 stars if the author had simply devoted one extra chapter about what the Gzilt felt after they Sublimed and how the secret may have played into it all.
B00005AXKF|1.0|I didn't know I ordered the wrong language!<br />I can't even play it because it says it's not in our region!<br />I am so Upset!!!!!!
B000GBEWHA|1.0|I ordered this item as a gift for my daughter because it showed a collectible little black jacket as sleeve. the first one I received came without it so I contacted Amazon and they said they will send me another one free of charge including the jacket...well it came without it again....other than that the movie it is great we the Grease lovers know that (five stars for the DVD), we already have several editions.<br />It was very disappointed received it like that after Amazon customer service assured me  that this time will be right.<br />May someone received two jackets and no DVD's who knows?
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but enjoyed the book more. The special effects were good, but character development was weak and less historical context than the book.
1451673442|5.0|i've read the other 2 byrne books enjoyed them enough to purchase this one. this is the best one i find. don't start reading until you're committed to reading the whole thing as if you stop you'll regret it and feel like you need to start over to get the full effect.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I highly recommend this inspiring book! this Near Death Experience on a whole new level! Much more technical than others I've read. I have read it several times, and will continue to refer to it.  A must read!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|not up to par for a Mitch Albom book. usually plow thru them but this was very slow to read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Secrets unfold with every page. I don't know what to do with my life until the next book comes out!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Overall a very entertaining movie. A little disappointing if you've read the book but good never the less a good movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Brilliant, what a ride. I recommend this to all who love a great story. Full of all of the emotions you expect but rarely get.
B0045XICB2|5.0|This movie was awesome. Kristen Stewart is an incredible actress and her beauty does Bella justice. I would highly recommend it.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|My kids are studying math without argument!  Wish I had found this last September.  Hoping this will help improve grades by Christmas break.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Very helpful app. I would regimend it. Better than some other options out there, and catchy graphics to boot. Has been fun to use.
B005LAIH4A|2.0|Upbeat songs, but it is pretty boring.  Lots of hitting and knocking over characters for humor.  Basically the same message of Wall-E, in a much lower class-form.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|I loved Duran Duran so much in the 1980's!  Their music was a big part of my life.  John Taylor was easily my favorite so I followed everything he did.  In the Pleasure Groove reminded me so much of all the memorabilia I collected and stored away.  Twenty-something years later it was all refreshed in my mind and heart.  I recommend this book for anyone who like and respect Duran Duran's musical style then, through the years,  or now.  You don't have to be a Durannie to enjoy this book, but if you are/were you will hardly be able to put this one down.
B0053O89RY|5.0|This is the most consistently wonderful show on television. I love all the characters. It would be hard to pick a favorite but if I had to, it would be Phil who is so naive and loveable and the perfect husband for Claire who is a little nutty herself. It is amazing how funny each episode is, but none of the humor seems forced. Definitely the best comedy show of all time! I don't want it to ever end, but if it does, I have all the dvds so far and will be buying them as each season becomes available.
B008XG1X18|5.0|a great way to enjoy pinterest away from your home computer. I love it. I have not had any issues with scrolling or freezing up on me. overall I would suggest it to friends and family.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The story is that the brain stopped functioning totally and the soul slipped away into this other place. The soul was fully aware of what was going on, on the &#34;other side&#34;, and retained a &#34;memory&#34; of the events. Then somehow, when the soul returned to the body, it transmitted everything to the author's now revived brain, in total clarity. The author was then able to recall, with his brain all of the information that the soul had absorbed. Despite all the extensive medical analysis in this book, I believe that all of this experience was created by the brain. It's not that I do not believe in some kind of existence after bodily death, it's just that I am not convinced by the author's  conclusions.<br />The book is worth reading by those who have a special interest  in near death experiences, because it does approach the subject in a different way.
B001F4UHGC|2.0|Watched this mainly to see the classic Mustang Gt and Dodge Charger chase.  That part was actually pretty good.  probably won't live up to its lofty praises though.  The rest of the movie was long and slow, painfully drawn out in unnecessary scenes, a meaningless and underdevoloped side story about the tensions in the relationship between Bullitt and his girlfriend and a plot that was thin with ridiculous bad guy behaviors.  Sure I can believe that a cold blooded professional hitman would leave two victims alive with potentially surivable wounds and walk away, right.....  Bullitt magically comes close to him in the chase scenes after in reality the time separation was so great the guy would obviously be long gone.  Same in the airport runway, the villian was in the clear hidden until he stupidly starts firing on Bullitt from long range with a pistol for no reason giving his position up.  Almost none of this story was believable, clearly developed or interesting.  The characters were flat, McQueen is nothing special.  I cared nothing about what happened to anyone in the movie since the charaters were hollow bores or cliches.  Do yourself a favor and fast forward to the car chase, its somewhat worth it, though also a bit on the silly side at times, and certainly overplays what those cars were capable of.  I resorted to Mystery Science theater type comments towards the end, it was on par at times with some of those movies .
B004GYY714|4.0|Although not every station is available there are more than enough to make you feel like you are in LA or Chicago or Philly or England and most anywhere else in the world. You got to try it.
B0086700CM|5.0|BEST app on the planet! really fun to play and easy to start. you'd be crazy not to download this and play. enjoy it!
B0087UN94E|5.0|I heard Neil being interviewed about this album and he spoke of the provenance for these arrangements.  This dates back at least to the 1970s way before Crazy Horse or even Buffalo Springfield.  These renditions of well known songs are (as Neil says) not necessarily the words that you might associated with them because he did his research and brings us the restored original lyrics.  The double offering comes with the music and video tracks (as a physical CD or a download) and in my opinion Neil will always be one of the very best and most talented of any musicians not just those out of Canada.
B003297I1U|5.0|Bruder products are always outstanding in quality and design and never fail to delight our grandchildren.  Our recent gift of this crane truck to our grandson in Manhattan was acknowledged with a photo of him lifting a molded fiberglass chair with metal legs about 18 inches off the floor with no damage to the molded plastic boom on the truck.  Bruder's attention to detail in their products generates sustained interest in their products and we have quit looking for any other brands in this type of toy.
B0091LS07E|2.0|still  sings  off  key, hi  jacks  older  songs  and  adds  nothing  to said  songs.  she  outta  trade  in those  14  grammys  and  learn  some  proper  pitch  and  learn  a  few  new  chords.  if  she listen  and  watched  Angela  Bofill then  she  might  actual  become  good  as  to  putting  out  bland  and soulless  muzak  and  hurting  my  ears  with  her  dolphin  yelps. Maxwell  is  wasted  singing  with  her  on  a  decent  track.  all  her  albums,phrasing  and tones  feel  like one big  ole  song. at  best  she  is a  ok talent. if  she  got  musically schooled  on  some Angela  Bofill  for  voice  and Brenda  Russell  for  composition  then  she  might  actually be in the  Right  \\"KEY\\"
B009GEAPYW|5.0|The people who gave this one star are not, I repeat, NOT fans of Batman and do NOT read comics or understand what great writing is.  Frank Miller reinvented the Batman with Year One.  Without Frank Miller there would not have been the Christopher Nolan films or Sin City.  Frank Miller is the creator of The Dark Knight.  This is by far one of the greatest comics ever written and a wonderful adaptation.  I highly recommend this for anyone who reads comics and understands the underlying social commentary that is going on throughout.  Read the comic and the sequel The Dark Knight Strikes Again.  This movie embraces the human spirit, the ability in all of us to stand up and fight back.  The reason Batman and Robin are so compelling is because they are not super, they are people, people who have had enough.  This movie brought tears to my eyes.  The people who don't like this are the same people that didn't understand The Sandman.  They are only looking for blockbuster Hollywood stuff, not actual storytelling.  Not that I think Christopher Nolan's new vision of Batman is poor, it's probably the best live action Batman around.  DO NOT BE MISLED BY POOR REVIEWS!!!!!

B005ZMTYBY|5.0|My daughter, 6 years old, and my son, 3 years old, LOVE this movie! They can watch it over and over. My son said that he wished he could jump into the TV (because he wants to be in the movie too). I guess it could be scary for some kids, but my kids have never been scared of things like ghosts, etc. We've always insisted that it's pretend and that there's nothing to be scared of so they aren't under the impression that they have anything to be afraid of. This is one of the only movies I've bought for my kids because I rented it and they kept wanting to watch it over and over. I highly recommend it for imaginative children that aren't afraid of Halloween characters.
B00008G7UJ|2.0|First off its flea market quality at best...<br /><br />Its a copied dvd (which duh is ILLEGAL) especially for resale.<br />The case is crap, the print on the dvd is amateur ...<br /><br />Its a fair quality dvd, though has some audio lag in some places (no its not my dvd player, ive tested it on multiple with same reaction)<br /><br />I suggest just go out and by the real deal
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome website! So glad to have an app for it! It's like a scrapbook without the big cumbersome three ring binder!

1567184855|5.0|Newton didn't start out believing in past lives or in the soul's realm between incarnations, but years of seeing hypnotherapy clients taught him otherwise. He has a systematic approach to explain what he learned in his years of research into this realm and he uses specific case studies to illustrate the basic truths he learned.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This Marware (I keep thinking Malware!) leather case is designed for the Kindle Fire HD 7; unlike some other KF HD 7 cases I've tried, it does not work for other 7-inch tablets! Just so you know. 8-) The case is high-quality. Unlike most other tablet cases, this one does not smell bad out of the box! Hopefully this means it does not contain weird coating chemicals. There is a hard shell inside the case where you fit the KF HD 7. The fitting is easy although I had to use a little bit more force that I was used to. The case folds horizontally to transform into a stand, just like any other tablet case/stand, but the hard shell is on a pivot so it can be turned, along with the KF HD 7, 90 degrees, so the KF can be placed horizontally or vertically! The case is sturdy, which means it's also bulky. But it's actually not as heavy as I had imagined when I first saw it. I got the black case which I think looks a little cheap. The other colors should look much better, if only because they add style to your Kindle Fire life! BTW, you do have access to all the ports when your KF HD is in the case.

0857865536|5.0|A week after finishing Life of Pi I'm still a bit at a loss for words to review it as it deserves---I mean, THIS BOOK. I never thought it was going to blow my mind as it did and when that happens it's always extremely difficult for me to put into words exactly what the book in question did to me.<br /><br />The whole story is one incredible journey, not only because of Pi's castaway condition, but also because I learned so much about other cultures, religions, and mostly about animals and animal behavior---all this in a way that no class could ever dream to teach me.<br /><br />Although I won't be able to fully express my admiration for what goes on in Life of Pi, I have to point out my two favorite things about it, and they were, 1. the stunning, perfect, flawless writing---seriously, even the long list of items on the survival kit and various other provisions had its appeal; and 2. the author's sharp, genius, made-me-laugh-out-loud-several-times sense of humor---I want to befriend this person and have four, five, six hours long chats with him.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie though, there were a couple of moments that almost made me stop reading, I honestly did not see those horrifying scenes coming, but I'm glad that I managed to keep on reading and find out how, when, where Pi's journey was going to end. That said, the last fifty pages or so made such a mess out of my brain that I'm still trying to put it back together properly.<br /><br />Without a doubt, one of the best books of the year for me, which means I RECOMMEND IT, even if I understand this is one of those books one either loves or hates with a passion.<br /><br />(Copy provided by the publisher, via NetGalley. Many thanks.)

B009FBX5M0|2.0|It sure doesn't sound like one. Believe me, I think it was high time new talent was brought on board to score the series as David Arnold had outstayed his welcome. But Thomas Newman? I understand that Newman and Sam Mendes have a long partnership together, but with Skyfall Newman is a square peg in a round hole. Personally I think that Craig Armstrong would have been a much better choice.<br /><br />The Bond theme almost completely absent here, save for the track 'Breadcrumbs', which feels like a cut-and-paste of previous concert performances of said theme. This is also the only Bond soundtrack album I am aware of that eliminates the title song from the track list. Maybe Adele didn't want her song being associated with such a mediocre score, though it would have made the overall quality of the album a bit better. Remember the loud 'Bond Chorus' blaring over the end credits? It's not here. In fact, the Bond Chorus, a theme often used when the character does something extravagantly 007 (smashing a tank through a wall, doing a wheelie through flames in a Kenworth truck), has NEVER been used during the actual movie for Daniel Craig's tenure thus far. Are they afraid to use it? Imagine Rambo without \\"It's a Long Road\\".<br /><br />Newman scores Skyfall in the most uninspired, generic way possible. It's certainly the weakest aspect of the movie. Since John Barry's reign ended in 1987 no one has really been able to adequately fill his shoes (although Michael Kamen gave it a good shot). I have no doubt that Newman is a talented composer, though he doesn't belong with his series.<br /><br />Music as heard in the film 2.5/5<br />Music as heard on the album 1.5/5<br />Overall 2/5
1451695195|5.0|The fact that the author is a neurosurgeon makes his story compelling. The fact that his experience is so similar to so many other near death experiences, yet slightly different, makes it even more believable.  Fascinating and makes me less afraid of death after reading. Also, these experiences make me think about that darned &#34;life review&#34; a bit more in my daily life to keep me on the higher road (most of the time)
B000002AH7|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out (I bought everything Miles and Coltrane came out with in the late 50s & 60s). Sketches of Spain stands out as my contrarian favorite because it is not jazz. This is really tight orchestral music (actually, concert band music since there are no strings) that transcends category.<br /><br />Everyone has commented on all of the tracks but the one track that gets short shrift; \\"The Pan Piper.\\" A tradition Galician flute song, arranged but not composed by Evans, it can be heard in the original on a 1952 field recording by Alan Lomax under the title \\"Toques de Chifro.\\" In a little over one minute, the soul of The Pan Piper is revealed by Galician folk flautist Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Rodriguez. No doubt, Evans used this field recording as the source of his stunning arrangement, which, I might add, does not really add that much to the raw musical essence of the original.<br /><br />Sketches of Spain is a genuine and enduring classic that sounds as fresh as the day it was recorded. Gil Evan's finely crafted arrangements could be played today and they would not sound any more contemporary but without the missing ingredient, Miles Davis' sound, what would be the point? This recording is so pristine that it could not be replicated, not even by Miles Davis (see, Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux).  Sketches of Spain is best heard in the original vinyl mix but any version is essential to anyone who loves good music.<br /><br />Is there room for another star?
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is amazing at character development and without boring you with unnecessary details.  Great action and suspense.<br /><br />This was a little change of pace from the rest of Mitch Rapp series as Rapp is shown to have a vulnerable side.  Again great book.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|The Beatles' 1968 album titled simply THE BEATLES, though usually called The White Album, marks a dramatic change in direction. The preceding three albums REVOLVER, SGT. PEPPER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR were masterpieces of psychedelia, expressing altered states of consciousness and social revolution. But now, on The White Album, you just can't hear the drugs any more.<br /><br />Instead one gets the impression that Paul McCartney is reconnecting with the American rock'n'roll of the late 1950s that first inspired the lads, especially on \\"Back in the USSR\\" (a jarring opener after three LSD-driven albums), \\"Rocky Racoon\\", \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Blackbird\\"; John Lennon is not so nostalgic for the past as shifting his interest from hallucinogens and peace to political activism (\\"Revolution\\"), the avant-garde (\\"Revolution 9\\"), disgust at various people (\\"Sexy Sadie\\", \\"Bungalow Bill\\") and love for Yoko Ono (\\"Everyone's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey\\"); George Harrison gives up the sitar and Hindu insight, choosing instead to record the appallingly bad social commentary \\"Piggies\\" that he had written years earlier.<br /><br />So after three tightly compiled and mind-expanding albums, what we have here is a jumble of songs where the counterculture magic is gone and everyone is going in different directions -- that The Beatles were well on their way to breakup in 1968 is well documented. Furthermore, the album sounds much less rich than previous efforts because their longtime producer George Martin was often away, and even when present he found it hard to draw good material from the band.<br /><br />So this is an incredibly flawed album. And yet, it does show that there was something very special about The Beatles, because even the worst of their late career is better than most music out there. Young people hearing the album for the first time today will probably recognize many of the songs from constant rotation on the radio even now, 45 years later. You might end up compiling your own playlist, dropping many of the songs here and almost never listening to the whole thing through, but you're sure to find a great deal of enjoyable music here.up compiling your own playlist, dropping many of the songs here and almost never listening to the whole thing through, but you're sure to find a great deal of enjoyable music here.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|This is a magnificent and brave book. It demands full support, and I am bold enough to express this. It brings together knowledge which many of us in medicine have known for some time, but it makes clear that the problem is worse than we have realised.<br /><br />This book strikes a fundamental blow to medical epistemology. We used to joke that \\"Half of what you learn in medical school will be of no use to you in practice- the problem is just that we don't yet know which half.\\" After reading this book you realise the problem is deeper- too much medical knowledge is suppressed from the start- and so as doctors we do not even know what we don't know. It just never crosses our consciousness. We don't even know the half of it.<br /><br />The flaws in medical knowledge Goldacre describes run wide and deep.<br /><br />Too much medicine is simply never published or recorded.<br /><br />Negative results \\"This does not work\\" are just as important to medical practice as \\"this does work.\\" Yet routinely negative studies are ignored, filed away, unpublished, maybe never even written up. There is no journal of failed treatments and other false starts. Authors and researchers don't get promoted for showing such results. Share prices don't rise on such news.<br /><br />Too much pre-selection and pre-editing goes on so that what reaches large journals and is then available to be incorporated into guidelines is rather over-optimistic, and based on a biased sample. (Most of the times a drug hasn't worked in a clinical trial the information simply vanishes into \\"internal company files\\") Goldacre points out how unethical this is- patients have been taking part in clinical trials to advance medical knowledge- and then the trial goes unpublished so no one can learn from it. Worse still some patients are at risk of harm as a result of this omission.<br /><br />The way information is presented to and by journals is biased. Large positive results are welcomed by drugs companies and journals alike- good for sales of both of them. Good for authors too. (Kudos/promotions) Some doctors put their names to articles they have barely even reviewed.<br /><br />Many trials are stopped too soon- so long term treatments are assessed over unrealistically short time scales. Many trials stop too soon so that later complications are missed out of the analysis.<br /><br />Many trials are set up against false or misleading comparators, rather than against best current treatments.<br /><br />Many journals are not robust in their peer review processes, and the possibility of obviously misleading flawed papers reaching publication (and so the credibility that goes with that) is huge. Peer review is touted as a gold standard of academic accuracy yet in reality it shows that fools seldom differ, and that great minds think alike. The misuse of reviewing by some competitive scientists to advance their own views, and to do down competition, rather than quality assure scientific results, is a blot on science's copy book. (I do peer review for some journals and sign my name to reviews- and try to be fair about a paper's merits)<br /><br />National Regulators are not given the full information about candidate drugs, and have no means to compel its production. So they make their assessments of a drug's merit on partial and positively skewed information. Bodies like NICE then have incomplete information on which to base their recommendations. All the way through the deletion and distortion of the published record of medicine is weakening our ability as doctors to make good treatment recommendations to our patients. We do not know either the positive results or the negative results properly, and so no one can get a proper overall view of which drug is good for which patients. The potential for harm by ignorance is huge here- whether by missed benefits or unrecognised side effects.<br /><br />All this means that the medical information data base is skewed, distorted and misleading. Asa doctor I try to practice evidence based medicine, and act in accordance with current assessments of best practice. What this book confirms is that my efforts are undermined before I start- all the information I need is not available at any stage of the process. I could be superbly read and up to date- and yet because of the flaws in the medical evidence base simply be moving deeper into misleading myself, and consequently my patients.<br /><br />This is not a comfortable realisation. The medical information base, that can then be consolidated into reviews, guidelines, the BNF, and text books is utterly flawed. The prevalence of deletions (missing information) and distortions (spin, misleading presentations of data) mean that my personal and our collective knowledge is inaccurate right from the start.<br /><br />And that's before my own prejudices and misunderstandings can even get going. Some years ago a post graduate tutor asked me to lead an EBM workshop and describe the process whereby we as doctors come to understand the evidence and then digest it and present it fairly to patients. I said I very much doubted that doctors do understand evidence very well themselves- we are easily misled by presentation effects- just as everyone else is. Ultimately the analysis of medical evidence is largely by means of detailed statistics, and few doctors understand these well. A patient of mine who was a statistician told me that his first question to a client was , \\"what do you want these statistics to show?\\" He could then work to their wish. Numbers do not speak for themselves, but can be made to sing sweetly if played right.<br /><br />This book shows that the current systems of discovering new medical knowledge, and of using existing knowledge well, are severely flawed. This is not a good state for my profession to find itself in. We have grand edifices of knowledge, and this book shows that many of them are built on sand. For a profession that prides itself on being based on accurate, well defined and described knowledge this is a very poor performance.<br /><br />Goldacre's book is important and raises significant questions about what we are doing as doctors, and about how we get the information we need to practice medicine well. This book shows that there are currently very widespread deep problems at every stage in the generation and distribution of medical knowledge.<br /><br />His book is well written, well exampled and accurate. It should compel action by many people in medicine, the pharmaceutical industry and by those around medicine who regulate knowledge generation.<br /><br />This is an important book, and it is vital for doctors to read it, no matter how uncomfortable its implications are for us.a doctor I try to practice evidence based medicine, and act in accordance with current assessments of best practice.

It a fun, easy breezy, laid back album that has some really great music. No Doubt definitely didn't force any of these songs and you can hear that. Any hard cord No Doubt fan will love this and any person new to No Doubt will find this refreshingly different than what's out there right now.

B007HACDLK|3.0|I am an avid reader and when Vince released his first book \\"Term Limits\\" almost 15 years ago...I was very impressed.  I have read all 14 of his books since and have enjoyed each one.  As with any Vince Flynn book featuring Mitch Rapp...they're page turners.  I believe I finished The Last Man in 2 days.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the book, I feel that Vince Flynn is pushing out his last three books too quickly.  The story lines and characters aren't being developed as well as they were in his earlier books.  I feel that he is repeating the \\"Mitch Formula\\" over and over without really adding anything new.  I feel that this book was predictable from the first to the last page...and I was a little disappointed with that.  Also missing from this book was the detail and in-depth information that made early Mitch Rapp books fantastic and riveting reads.  This book offered great opportunities for details on surveillance, human intelligence, small team tactics, counter-ambush tactics, close quarter battles, etc. and none of those opportunities were seized upon by Vince Flynn.  Also absent was Vince's detailed touches on weapons and the employment of those weapons...again, there were great opportunities presented during the book...but, they were not exploited.  I feel that these missing details are what made previous Vince Flynn books fantastic...where as this book was just decent.<br /><br />Is it a good read and worth taking time out of your day to read, absolutely...but, is it as good as prior Mitch Rapp books...not even close.

Even if you didn't see those movies but are passing familiar with these characters then you'll still enjoy this movie.

When someone wins, a window pops up letting you know the other persons stats and asks if you would like to play again with the same player. If you touch anywhere else it disconnects with the player. Also when someone wins or someone forfeits the other player can't finish their game. You can play the deal again, but you start with a fresh deal.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|I have this game for my kindle fire. So when the lastest update game with new hoverboards and Christmas mine did not update. I unistalled and reinstalled the game I loged into my facebook and all my stats and friends were gone. I had a record on 1.8 million.
B008WHTFL8|5.0|This album was worth the wait! Definitely returns to the great sound that was on Permission to Land. Great album to listen to while driving.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|totally relaxing. it really helps to drown out the outside world to allow me to get restful sleep. great job!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It's star wars. In blu-ray. So yeah, I really liked this product. I think I bought this used, but it was in great shape - no glitches, plays beautifully.
B009M8E3K4|5.0|I was quite anxious to see this film, a)having seen this mesmerizing trailer; b)being another one of Mr. Young's countless disciples.  Before his scheduled concert at Massey Hall in Toronto, we are privy to an exclusive passenger seat tour, with Neil in the driver seat (following his older brother Bob); of his beloved hometown in Omemee, Ontario.  We see the spot where he fished as a child, where his old home once stood, the school named after his well respected father;  returning to his roots obviously stirs fond memories and affection.<br />  A fleeting moment had me smiling; still driving, Neil was recollecting about something when someone on the sidewalk hollers, \\"nice car, buddy!\\"  Neil gives him a thumbs up, along with a proud 'thank you'.<br />  Then comes the concert.  Filmed as a solo engagement in support of his recent release 'Le Noise', Mr Young offers beautiful renditions from this, as well as many others spanning his extraordinary career. The show is both acoustic and electric.  Highlights include a captivating 'Peaceful Valley Blvd', to such subtle and sublime effect, it creates a lasting ambiance hinting of lingering Native spirits.  A tremendously powerful electric rendition of 'Ohio, to which the sixty-six year old man's voice simply soars.  I was awestruck; that's no exaggeration. Toward the show's close, Neil is seated at his antique pump organ, to deliver a spellbinding version of his timeless masterpiece 'After The Gold Rush.'<br />  If you're not that familiar with Neil Young and wondering what all the hoo-ha is about; this film will certainly help you understand.  If you've yet to see the film, and you're a Neil head like myself...whaddya waiting for!<br />  See it. And read his book, 'Waging Heavy Peace' while you're at it.  You might think Neil's giving me five bucks to say that, but he's not.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this series of albums from Vai. I had only read a review about the series in Guitar World. Decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I am floored by this man's ability to speak with his instrument. He is just awe inspiring. His songs are just that, songs. Not just vehicles for him to solo over and show you how good he is. No this dude takes it beyond that on the series \\"Real Illusions\\" which this album \\"Story of Light\\" is the second in a series of three (the third is yet to be released/written).<br /><br />It goes without saying that Vai is a phenomenal guitarist. But what's more to the point here is that he is perhaps one of the greatest musicians of our times. And on the two albums in this series, he demonstrates perhaps the greatest guitar playing I have ever heard.
159102594X|4.0|Five years ago I began to \\"learn\\" to read fantasy novels.  A complete novice with the genre, it really wasn't easy for me.  I bought this book, read about 100 pages and decided this just wasn't doing anything for me.  I gave the book away.  Fast forward to more recent times and this book kept coming back to my mind but I couldn't remember author or title.  Bingo!  Amazon recommended the newest Joe Abercrombie to me and while investigating that one I rediscovered The First Law trilogy.  Thank Goodness for that!  I discovered here a fantasy world which ultimately leads to a broad picture by taking the reader through all the squalid situations and barbaric actions of all concerned.  This is entertainment?  Yes, it was.<br /><br />A book filled with anti-heroes.  A book which seems to wander from one plot thread to the next without making connections.  A book of dark, grim subjects.  Put them all together and what I found was the first part of a story which kept me completely engrossed in spite of my aversion to things like torture.  Everybody is bad in some way here, well, maybe with the exception of Collem West, and yet I found them all to be fascinating characters.  This author made each personality in this novel so disreputable that they actually became quite endearing to me.<br /><br />This is not a stand alone novel because everyone (who survived) is now heading someplace else to engage in even more mayhem.  I can hardly wait to begin the second book, [[ASIN:0575077883 Before They Are Hanged]].
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awe man this book had me going since the first page. I seen the movie first which was ok, I wish I would of saved my money and brought the book. I'm not an avid reader or anything I just wanted something to read on my new kindle. I have to tell you I made the right choice. Once I started reading I couldn't stop until I was done. Excellent read, would recommend for any teenager to adult man or woman. Looking forward to reading  book 2 of the hunger games!!!
B007REV4YI|2.0|Like most James Bond fans, I was pretty taken with Casino Royale. Here was at last the plausible Bond film the studios had so often promised then failed to deliver- James Bond with a minimum of cute gadgets and a maximum of bombastic mayhem. So what if a third of the film was a poker game, and that game was so confusingly shot that you could barely tell who was winning and how? Here was a return to the roots of Bond. It felt like From Russia With Love all over again.<br /><br />Fast foreword to Quantum of Solace, and everything went down the tubes. Back was the over-serious silliness of the Brosnan years (the villain lives in an exploding hotel and steals rivers Carmen Sandiego style) and a major character (the sexy but physically and emotionally scarred South American secret agent hunting a renegade general) was shamelessly lifted from License to Kill, which most Bond fans will tell you is one of the three or four WORST Bond movies. That the whole package was only a little more than an hour long was a tender mercy.<br /><br />With Skyfall, early reviews were quite promising. No more silliness, the word was. Back to the grit! Sadly, this is absolutely not the case.<br /><br />The film's start lets you know what's in store. After an admittedly exciting chase (which can be read as a huge slap in the face to female drivers pretty easily) we get an introduction with smoky soul music and dancing naked lady silhouettes- we might as well be in an early Moore film at this point (not that I have anything AGAINST Adelle's excellent opening track). This sets the tone for a sloppy return to 60s goofiness. Does the villain have a private island? Does a henchman get killed in a pit of exotic creatures? Does Bond sleep with a high-class hooker who is then murdered in some ridiculous way? The answer to all of these questions is yes. Bond even trots out Connery's gadget-laden DB5, which begs the question of whether the events of the classic Bond films were meant to have happened inthis continuity somehow.<br /><br />The few bits of the movie that are not grifted from the Bonds of the '60s-'80s are just confusing. Why does the villain need to be arrested and taken to MI6 headquarters so he can escape into the London underground, a location with literally hundreds of public entrances? Why does a master hacker live in a hugely obvious location where he is the only inhabitant? Why is a big deal made of Bond's tiny radio when he had one injected into his arm in Casino? The whole movie is full of holes you can drive a truck through. Worse, an overplay on Bond's orphan-dom, complete with a brooding ancestral mansion and crusty old manservant (who was obviously meant to be Sean Connery until casting actually happened) all suggest that the filmmakers sort of want us to think of James Bond as an English Batman.<br /><br />There are gleams of light here and there- Daniel Craig still has some of the best screen presence and swagger of any Bond, and Dench's M is outstanding, but they aren't enough. By the film's end, when Bond has failed to achieve anything and walks right into M's classic office from the 60s (padded door and all) the movie's descent into confused irrelevance is complete.<br /><br />At least we have Casino Royale, I guess.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Solid performances from the principals<br />-Beautifully shot (but there are really no ugly Bond movies)<br />-Not boring<br />-Has an Aston Martin in it<br />-Good soundtrack, especially compared to Quantum<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Confused screenplay equates surprise to quality and fails to deliver either<br />-Plot holes that Timothy Dalton could 5-wheel a semi full of cocaine through<br />-Needless nostalgia tripping that just makes everything feel silly and contrived<br />-Skyfall is a big scary house with a grouchy Scotsman living in it. This makes it officially the lamest eponymous story element in any James Bond film.<br />-Aston Martin is blown up instead of driven to Monaco as it should be
B004SKIPXW|5.0|THIS VIDEO HAS BOTH, POP OUT AND IN DEPTH THE KINDA MOVIE FOR THE ONES THAT ENJOY A BIT OF BOTH STYLES AWESOME.
1451613512|1.0|This kind of deluded, revisionist drivel is the kind of dreck one would have been subjected to under Stalin, as Stone undertakes to airbrush out--and in--facts and fantasy that fit with his personal version of the way things should have been.  No, I didn't buy it (and neither should you); I borrowed it from a friend who was desperately trying to find someone--anyone--to spare him the indignity of having to display it on his bookshelf. From here is it destined for a late night drop into the library return bin, wiped clean of all fingerprints. No way I want this traced back to me!
1608862801|4.0|This comic is great.  It includes the first four issues as well as the free comic book day issue.  It is funny, clever, and a great addition to Aventure time lore.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have the backup stories which are present in the standalone comics (Or so i've been told I don't own the standalone comics).  Definetly worth the 9 bucks.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The third book in the Song of Fire and Ice saga by George RR Martin is getting better. I'm really enjoying how unpredictable the plot twists are. Compelling read. Looking forward to the next book.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Allowed me to (re)capture online video on my phone, copy it to work computer(that doesn't allow streaming video), and share with coworkers.<br /><br />It validated downloading and installing the Amazon marketplace in itself.
0671027344|1.0|honestly this book was not memorable AT ALL. had to force myself to get through it. would not recommend it at ALL. and the writing style was dull and dry. Awful.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Just like season one and two. Main characters dying, zombies everywhere, crtical decisions. I was constantly on the edge of my seat waiting for the next attack or personal conflict.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|If your true love is an action movie, you would not be disappointed.  however, i wanted a balanced movie with suspense, character development etc.  Oh well.....
B001RHPJBU|2.0|I Love Phil Collins, I just had no idea that my favorite songs of his were live performances on this album.  I prefer studio done stuff.  Was just dissatisfied because of this.
B0045XICB2|5.0|There was so much more action and suspense in this 3rd installment plus all the characteristics that i loved from the earlier features -  that I had to give it 5 stars.  When  you keep getting surprised in a positive way, that is a big accomplishment particular in these &#34;sagas&#34; of multiple movies that are part of the same storyline.  What makes this so compeling to me is that the characters were well developed and interesting and there were no lose ends. Given that there were two more parts to the saga to come,  I felt this one ended without a frustrating cliff hanger that would lend itself to an agonizing wait for the next installment a year later.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Wonderful because my four month old son could manipulate it himself after just a few days. Saved lots of time searching for a pacifier, especially when driving!
0199206589|5.0|Is a sistematic and academic review about geopolitics, its historical evolution and political tool. It gives to the reader a overview and proximity to this political fenomenon.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I will say I was concerned that I had received a bootlegged copy, but that is how the disc is SUPPOSED to look.<br /><br />Overall I am a huge fan of the movie. I think the plot and actors are all wonderful. Five stars.
B009186E3O|5.0|I think that what makes the documentary at the heart of this box set so refreshing is the fact it was shot without the preconception that it would be shown anywhere. It was really meant to be a trial run, a kind of \\"proof of concept\\" aimed to get the Rolling Stones ready for a more professional piece along the lines of the Beatles' Hard Day's Night, which had come out a year earlier. At the time this was shot, the Stones were obviously already popular and still a bit uncomfortable with and confused by their status as stars and sex symbols. They're still sorting it out, not even sure they want to be pop stars or what it all means. It's nice to see that when they are asked questions about who they are and what they stand for, they seem to be thinking it through and working it out, not all that polished, they're puzzling a bit on the difference between who they are and the role they play on stage and in front of fans and reporters. Some of the best bits are of them working out songs, improvising, or singing around the piano, relaxed.<br /><br />They are so young here. More importantly, they're coming at the cusp of the social revolutions of the late 60s and just beginning to glimpse its potential and realizing they were a part of it. It's really worth watching as a document of an era of transition. Well-dressed kids, coming to their concerts, and then mobbing the stage. The documentary was painstakingly reconstructed for the 50th Anniversary of the Rolling Stones, and the footage looks great. The soundtrack, from both the Rolling Stones and the Andrew Oldham Orchestra, feels fresh and alive and sounds amazing. This set comes with a DVD and Blu-Ray copy of the film, including the original 35-minute cut by Peter Whitehead, a longer 50-minute producer's cut by Oldham, their manager, and then an even-longer 65-minute extension done by ABKCO music, for which they had to restore all of the original bits as well as collate video with audio from various sources. (There's also a documentary on both the Blu-Ray and the dvd about the difficult restoration process - this was obviously a labor of love.) The special set also comes with a soundtrack album and a CD - as well as the vinyl LP! - of a live concert in England, and comes with a facsimile of the poster for the concert in Belfast. The box set would make a perfect gift for Rolling Stones fans - but the dvd or Blu-Ray by themselves are highly recommended for fans of music or of documentaries, and especially those interested in the '60s. Maybe not as important as [[ASIN:B002P8O29K Gimme Shelter]] (which came near the end of the revolutionary era that's just beginning here), or as polished as [[ASIN:B001G0INIE Shine A Light]] (which shows a mature group much later, still enjoying the music) but in some ways I like this best, as they feel young and hopeful and have an unknown future ahead of them. It feels quite fresh and is a great piece, well worth watching. (Note: I was sent a preview copy of this set, with the request that I review it honestly.)a documentary on both the Blu-Ray and the dvd about the difficult restoration process - this was obviously a labor of love.)

B007HACDLK|4.0|I have been a major Mitch fan for ever. I have read all of his adventures. This one didn't employ Mitch's talents to there fullest. The man lives and breathes action. He didn't get all of the people that needed to be attended to this time. I would hate to see him soften up in the future. I will be at the front of the line for his next outing.
B00913P6G0|4.0|No wonder why everybody is praising Kendrick´s album because it lives up to the hype. The only problem is the collabo with Drake who clearly is off-beat on the poetic justice record (and is the reason why I do not give a perfect score). Other than that Good Kid: M.A.A.D City is a superb album from top to bottom.<br /><br />I believe Kendrick was also influenced by Outkast and the Organized Noise, listening to \\"art of peer pressure\\" definitely reminded of \\"the art of storytelling\\" off of \\"Aquemini\\", and there´s a couple other songs that got tha ´Kast vibe into it and it´s all good!!<br /><br />If continuing in this path Kendrick has a bright future but of course the pressure of the 2nd album will be on his shoulders but that´s another story. For now we have to appreciate Good Kid: M.A.A.D City for what it is: a marvelous rap record, one of the best to come out in 2012.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|I really wanted to like this game, but the problems I've had with it in just three days have destroyed any enjoyment I derived from it.  At first, I was really excited about it, and even made two in-app purchases of bits so I could speed things up.<br /><br />The second purchase of bits is when the problems started.  After spending $19.99 on a Bucket of Bits... it never showed up in the app.  I waited 12 hours, rebooted and re-synced my Kindle, and basically did everything short of uninstalling and re-installing the app to make the purchased bits show up.  Nothing worked.  I finally had to call Amazon customer support.  They were very helpful, and refunded my money and helped me re-purchase the Bucket of Bits, waiting on the phone with me to make sure they showed up in the app this time.  It did, and I thought my problems were solved.  I made it to level 29, and socially connected to friends through Gameloft to exchange gifts in-game.<br /><br />And then, in the middle of playing, the game crashed.<br /><br />It wouldn't load, no matter what I did, and again, I tried everything.  Holding the power button for 20 seconds before rebooting.  Clearing the app cache.  I contacted Gameloft support.  Nothing worked.  The only way to continue playing was to uninstall and re-install the app.<br /><br />I lost everything.  My levels, my progress, my in-app purchases.  Amazon customer support once again helped, and refunded the money I spent on my now completely lost in-app purchases, but to play again I had to start completely from scratch.  The game still recognized my Gameloft ID and welcomed me whenever I started the game, but apparently it couldn't retrieve my progress.<br /><br />And then, the icing on the cake.  All my Gameloft friends that I had connected to in my previous game?  Lost.  I couldn't connect to them, and they couldn't connect to me.  We didn't even show up in each others' Gameloft Friends list in the game any more.  We're STILL trying to figure out how tofix this latest problem.  We're friends on the Gameloft site, but not in MLP!  To say that, at this point, I am overflowing with irritation is quite the understatement.<br /><br />Play this game and invest your precious time and/or money at your own risk.
B009GENZ12|4.0|I actually liked this movie. It left me in suspense which I love but even better was the ending...very messed up but it will make you think is this right or wrong...you have to watch it to understand. Overall it was a good suspenseful movie.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love Rod Stewart, especially the fact that he can do ANY genre and make it the best!  This Christmas album puts me in mind of his Classics albums.  It is not your Rock Around The Christmas Tree type although not all the songs are slow or serious.  I think it is enjoyable seasonal fare and I love the mixture and Rod's voice and the spin he puts on each song.  If you love Christmas/Holiday music I don't think Rod will disappoint.
B000244FDW|3.0|This version was tolerable. I didn't like this version as much as I hoped I would but it's the BBC and the do most movies right. I didn't like the person playing Mr. Bingely or Elizabeth in this version but overall It was pretty good version.

B007V508CC|5.0|But still he does know how to please his fans and those NOT his fans! He hits great ranges and knows what beats get our feet bouncing as we walk or run along to his music.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|When used carefully, it works as advertised.  Your results will vary depending on the bottles you're using and your patience.  The aluminum bars are light but flexible so you have to be careful to keep constant tension on the main bar while cutting.  Otherwise you can get a slightly wavy line making it difficult to break.  Check out youtube for lots of how-to videos.  I found using the hot & cold water technique to break the bottle easier than using the supplied tapping bar.
