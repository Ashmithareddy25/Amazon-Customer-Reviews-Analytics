B0098VYCCE|4.0|I like the drama and sincerity of the acting. And I especially like that the Queen had a brother who was as equally evil and mean as the queen. The insecurity of the queen was actually bought on by how she was treated in the past and not because she was so insecure about her looks. It was a good story but just alittle unclear as to which guy Snow chooses in the end.
0811826848|4.0|Great book to learn about the Beatles.  It tells of their early years of growing up and meeting each other . About forming the greatest band ever,and song writing team of Lennon and McCartney. This book also contains photographs never released. I'm glad I purchased this book to learn things I never knew about each of them.
B00005014I|5.0|Edit: This has been re-released in a 3-DVD box set [[ASIN:B00829GFNC Gould Plays Bach]]. The current DVD is the third of the three.<br /><br />Amazon webpage has numerous errors about this DVD. I tried to correct it without success so far.<br /><br />This DVD is for ALL REGIONS (Region 0), not Region 2. It is in PAL, not NTSC. So most DVD/Blu-ray players can play it. My 7-year-old Bose, which is Region-1 locked, plays this DVD perfectly.<br /><br />As for Gould's Goldberg Variations, it is divine.
1476712042|4.0|I was very hesitant to read this book at first because I thought it was going to be just another corny love story but once I started, I couldn't put it down until I was done. The characters are well developed and the back-stories add a little mystery. Once you find them out it also explains a lot about why things happened the way they did and why certain characters are the way they are. Abby and Travis both have such interesting stories surrounding them that its hard not to love them. America and Shep are the devoted best friends that make the story seem even more relate-able. It's definitely not a book for the older crowd, more along the lines of 18-25 but it was a great read in my opinion. It was very well written and hope Jamie McGuire comes out with more just like it!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I am a huge Ken Follett fan and loved the other two in this series.  In this book, I felt that the characters were forced into the story to make points about history and politics- which has worked in the past but I felt it was too transparent this time.  I realize that this is an extremely complicated historical time (and have learned quite a bit that I didn't know) but I find myself predicting elements based on characters that are introduced.  All this being said, I enjoyed the book and will continue to read all Ken Folletts work!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book came highly recommended on Amazon's Best of the Year So Far list. I knew very little about it, but after the first 3 pages I knew I was in for an experience. North Korea has been a deep fascination for me since seeing the documentary The Red Chapel a few years ago. The idea that a place is so absurd that the reality is stranger than any fiction could dream up was mind altering. To then read a fiction about this bizarro world of fictions masquerading as facts, and people forced to fit the story or perish, was gripping.<br /><br />As a programmer for a documentary film festival this idea of \\"what is truth?\\" is one that I'm often faced with when watching films. And in the end, all documentaries are artistic reconstructions of truth, trying to leave behind a story for the future that can accurately portray what happened, what people felt, and often who was right and wrong. I've been very cavalier in my feeling that editing, cinematography, music, all used to influence the narrative are necessary artistic imperatives for the filmmaker to get his point across in a 80-90 min film.<br /><br />But after reading The Orphan Master's Son and seeing how malleable and elastic the truth can be in the hands of a propaganda machine the size of the DPRK it has forced me to reevaluate how much license anyone telling a story, purported to be truthful or documentary, should be allowed to take before it becomes a fiction. It's a conundrum that I have not had a chance to sort out yet.<br /><br />As for the book, safely packed as a fiction with no claims to being fact, I found it even more compelling. To read something so outrageous and think it to be satire, and then to contemplate that it's almost not exaggerated enough to be satire, gave a sense of the real truth that is greater than any non-fiction book could convey about North Korea. So how odd that Mr. Johnson has in the end created a \\"biography\\" of a character in North Korea that reveals a greater truth about the place andthe people trapped there than a straight article or news story ever could? How appropriate to show the true power of fiction to convey a truth. The Dear Leader would be proud.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This book was very interesting to read and it made me how I think of money very differently. It was well written with giving examples from his own life that ties in with what he is trying to convey to the reader.
B007DJUO8O|4.0|I've had this CD for about a week and have listened to it maybe 7 times. Have to admit I was ok with it on the first listen but was certainly surprised by how mellow it is. Normally I need some thrashing about here and there to really enjoy music and did initialy miss that on this effort. No thrashing about here and there on this one....but that's fine. With every listen I do like it more. Very mellow, with all the unique mixes of acoustic guitar, strange time changes, and vocal greatness I have liked about Wilson. At points it has some truely bizarre noises in the mix that make you wonder how they are doing that which make it an interesting listen even without a sudden input of guitar and drums crashing in at various times. Not a great listen in the car really because of all the subtle stuff on here but at home with the headphones on and a buzz going it's really quite an amazing listen. If you are expecting ANYTHING of the thing based solely on past efforts by Wilson you might be dissapointed with this but keep an open mind folks and this will be enjoyed more with each listen. I'm not familiar with the Opeth efforts out there before hearing this but may have to check them out now. If I hear any of that growling vocal thing though I'm out of there! All through this you will find really nice acoustic guitar playing and excellent vocals and gosh darn it that seems to be enough to keep me going until Steven gets something new from the studio out there anyway....it's all good.
0439023513|5.0|I loved it. It was so hard to put it down.I could not stop reading after the second book.I recommend it to everyone.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Waaaaaaaaaaay Better than the first! Its no 50 shades to me cuz i loved that series but this is a great story. More tragedy. I loved it!
B007SGM084|4.0|what can i say - i finished all 3 books in 2 weeks. that's never happened, i mean i normally take months to finish one book.<br />LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE it!
B008SVS3FC|5.0|This is a truly great CD, one of John Hiatt's best yet.<br />Over the past couple years he has seemed to slow down and go for more folk/country-ish CD's (Same Old Man and Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns for example). Not to say they were bad records, they just showed the older John Hiatt seeming to slow down.<br />On this CD John Hiatt seems to be going back to his roots of rock and blues seen in Bring the Family, Tiki Bar, and Walk On (to name a few). \\"Bite Marks\\" and \\"Alright Now\\" are two highlights of his blues and rock while \\"I Just Don't know What to say\\" is a classic John Hiatt ballad.<br />I strongly recommend this CD for any John Hiatt fan, or any person looking to get into his music. This is clearly a classic.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I'm so glad that we bought the first season of AHS!  I'd heard how good it was and definitely wasn't disappointed.  Highly recommended.  Can't wait for the second season to start!
0385742886|4.0|When I first heard this book was coming out I was extremely excited. I expected it to involve the events right before The Maze Runner. However, that was not the case. This book takes us back further than that, to a time when the Flare had just released. It introduces us to more fast pace reality than that of Thomas'. The book focuses on a new group of people and their quest to find answers to what has happened. Overall I enjoyed this book a lot. The ending left the possibility for another book but with or without it, it is a good precursor to the Maze Runner.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like the Temple Run games, but it does get a bit dull overtime.  I enjoy these types of games, but their longevity for holding my attention is short.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Poorly acted. Poorly executed. Good idea. Zero character development. The story line is disjointed and does not flow. It appears the director tried to emulate Peter Jackson, but fell short.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|The movie had great special effects; however, the story content wasn't that great.  It does expand the Underworld world for future movies and I think I'll probably watch them, but I'd say this is my least favorite of the movies.
1439170916|5.0|I learned so much about cancer from this book. The disease is not one disease but a myriad of diseases all under the same name. I was thinking that cancer was caused by environmental factors and to some extent it is, especially the lung cancer and cigarette connection, but cancer has been around since the days when Jesus walked the earth and I certainly don't believe they had our polluted environment back then. I listened to it on audio book and followed up with the written book for reference. Highly recommended!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|For the 40th anniversary, Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung\\" gets a face lift. The cover artwork looks like it has been sitting on a shelf undisturbed for forty years with aged discoloring, but the sound is new. Previous CD releases of this classic have suffered sonically being thin and edgy, much tape hiss, an incomplete track, added reverberation, etc. Most of what is heard here is from 16 track analog tapes circa 1970, which were transferred to 96k/24 bit at Abbey Road by Kris Burton, then remixed by Steven Wilson (of Porcupine Tree fame) via Logic Audio 9.1.4. Steven did a great job! The new mixes really don't sound new, just revived. By using emulators of original period equipment, reducing tape hiss and paying close attention to the original mix, many, many veils have been removed. The sound is much fuller, present and personal. For example, the drums have more \\"whack\\". In general, everything has more body and better dynamics. In spite of these improvements, you'd be hard-pressed to notice many changes in individual instrument levels, effects or pans from the original '71 vinyl release. Great work for a great work!<br /><br />Note the 62.4dBC dynamic range of the new mix of the title track, an improvement of 2.9dB. On average the song is louder (82.5dB vs, 79.6dB), yet still offers more range. The song's quietest passage is 30.2dB, while it's loudest is 92.6dB, versus the 1984 version of 32.2dB and 91.7dB respectively.<br /><br />Included in the 40th anniversary edition is a 32 page booklet with many color photos of the band, etc., and interviews with Ian Anderson and Steven Wilson.<br /><br />The second CD contains fourteen 1970 and 1971 recordings made just before and after Aqualung. Five of these tracks have not previously been released, and another three of them have been remastered. This double cd* is a steal for the $17.95 retail price!<br /><br />*There is also a deluxe 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition, which includes; a 12'x12' 48 page booklet, a 180 gram vinyl pressing, the two cds, a DVD and a Blu-ray. The DVD and Blu-ray have the two cds plus a few extra tracks in 96/24 LPCM stereo, plus a 5.1 remix by Steven Wilson, and the original Quad mix, both in DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby Digital.nyl pressing, the two cds, a DVD and a Blu-ray.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!! This game is a lot more fun than I thought it was going to be. It sure takes you back a decade or two. LOL!!!!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|all of this developers apps are nice and simple. this keeps the functionality of the app great. great app for that added motivation. highly recommend.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Awesome movie. Action packed. Liam Neeson is great in this role. It keeps you oon the edge of your seat! Have seen it three times and it doesn't get old!!!
0525953728|4.0|If you are looking for a swamp of action, the unstoppable type you see on Call of Duty, this book lags in that aspect. But if you're just interested in the mission that took out Bin Laden, you will definitely find this story satisfying. It might not be as spectacular as its hype, but it's well worth your while.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are exceptionally talented musicians and creative songwriters. They mix popular and classical music as well as their own original work. They do amazing things with their instruments - watch their YouTube channel to see how many different kinds of sounds they can make with cellos and pianos. And all their music is appropriate for the whole family. If you buy one album this year, make this one it.
0470901071|5.0|This book was well written. It was very useful and helped me to be well prepared when I took my CCNA.
B00846REIS|4.0|I found this novel quite similar to the \\"Fifty Shades\\" novels but is much better written.  Characters are well developed and makes you want to keep reading.  I did download the sequel as soon as I finished this novel as I was intriqued enough to want to learn more about what happens with the 2 main characters.<br />Good light, entertaining reading.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|fun and enjoyable. except for the interruptions.  I am giving youthe review now so I am not asked any more.  these games need to let the player get past the first stage before asking to be rated<br />it is too early for 5 star
B0096C7QF0|5.0|This is a fantastic performance by a fantastic guitarist. He gives feeling to each note. I would recommend this highly.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I didn't want it to end..great graphics &amp; perfect that you can zoom in on hidden objects. It was just plain fun..can't wait for next one!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game big fish! This game is entertaining enough to keep me busy for awhile. Priced just right, I say, get comfy, download this app, turn out the lights and have some fall time fun! :)
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I saw this in the theater and it was good. Good scary and eerie music and the setting g inside the alien pyramid is scary. Also,  the creature effects were great. However,  the characters acted like retarded brags. For example, Fifield the geologist freaks out when he sees the dead headless engineer and runs away but later on,  he is awed by the alien penis snake and even pets it! Also,  Dr. Shaw refuses to let the team member take weapons with them when they set out to explore the alien structure despite the dangers they would encounter. We also have the scene when she takes the alien fetus out of her with the surgery pod. Her uterus was damaged and she must have had some heavy internal bleeding yet she runs around with no problems during the rest of the movie! Still a great movie!
B009CPRZ9I|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, and bought it the second it became available, but it pales in comparison to the source material, Frank Miller's original work.  I read it when it first came out and it helped to elevate what comics could be. IMHO, this one the top 5 comics of all time and is responsible for Batman's revival as relevant Character.<br /><br />The animation was OK, but not great.  The voice acting was good.<br /><br />I hope this is made into a live action movie at some point. Nolan could do it justice.<br /><br />This is THE seminal Batman story that all others since owe a great debt.  Any true Batman fan should read the comic/graphic novel.<br /><br />I enjoyed the extras and am looking forward to the next installment.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Its strange to update a movie/dvd review, but here goes...<br /><br />I updated my review of this installment from 3 stars to 4 stars.  After seeing Part 2 and then watching both in tandem, I've come to have a greater appreciation for Part 1.  My only criticism of this installment is chiefly due to how the mutant gang and their leader were represented.  They (the mutants) had an old school Saturday morning cartoon villain look about them that, to me, made them seem too nonthreatening.<br /><br />While Part 1 can stand on its own legs, it definitely stands taller and is more satisfying when paired with Part 2.  I'm not sure why it was necessary to break it up into 2  parts.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game that's simple to learn along with nice graphics and music. It's certainly worth the price.
0525953728|2.0|This book is a 5 at best, to much patting himself on the back. Read about 1/2 of the book,set it down and have not picked it up again.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it keeps freezing and having to shut down every now and then but I thoroughly enjoy having this app because I'm so addicted to pinterest.
006016848X|5.0|I highly reccommend this book. It has great insight into men and women. But there r already so many good reviews.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Beautiful game of match 3 (&quot;Bejewled&quot; like) with a neat story line. Very cool.  Works well on my HTC Inspire. Defintely a Keeper!
1557048630|5.0|I loved it as i loved the movie. It arrived sooner than I expected. The art of the dragons is more complete than the vikings but it was worth it
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have to say ive read all the Percy Jackson and heroes of Olympus books and there all great but i lkke this one especially the ending has great plot and the fact that we know more about annabeth and what sher perspective is. overall great book
B007SGM084|5.0|I purchased the trilogy for my best friend after I downloaded it on my phone.  My best friend said he wanted to read the books too so I purchased the trilogy for him. He is cowboy through and through and he really is enjoying 50 Shades of Grey. There is definately something in the writing for everyone, if you are open minded.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted! Love Love love his app. Glad the kindle fire finnally got this app. I spend hours pinning stuff
B007J26P0G|2.0|I bought this from Platinum Micro.  It was difficult to set up.  I thought it was DOA, but really needed to jam the memory in.  There is not WLAN !  Even though the specs say there is.  There is also no VESA mount.  This ended up being an expensive mistake, after the OS, Memory, and SSD.
0790729342|4.0|I had not seen this movie for about 30 years. I liked it then and I liked it this time around, as well. This movie is the sequel to MAD MAX and I would suggest you watch that one first so you understand the circumstances that take Max (Mel Gibson) to the \\"edge of hell\\" in THE ROAD WARRIOR. The world is DESTROYED and DEGENERATED. The arrid outback of Australia is the scene of this sci/fi action story.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Take new cable was a perfect replacement of the old one. The original cable disintegrated. The covering cracked & exposed the wires.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|You should go back and read the last book so that you are caught up with all thats going on but all in all its a good book. shouldnt have to wait a year for the next one but hey it is what it is.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|This is a soothing, melancholy vocalist brings a romantic setting to any special evening or calms stressed nerves before a big event. Whatever the reason, this CD will soon become a favorite as it did for me!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Romantic novel. Appears to be written more towards women than men like most romance novels.  Easy enough to read but would not consider it a masterpiece although I continue to read it in my leasure.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett stays true to himself - he takes the families from book 1 (World War 1) - and takes the families thru World War 2 - based on the beliefs and the history the families learned in book 1. It's riveting and you may as well take a few days off of work - your mind is on what's next in the book - not on what is happening in the 9-5!<br /><br />Ken Follett - you did it again!  Great Book!
1423140591|5.0|Continue the adventure and meet some new characters.  This book is a real page turner that you won't want to put down.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's like Bejeweled, but with a plot! I highly recommend it, especially since it's free today! Great game, I'd gladly pay for it

B00095NX9G|5.0|Okay if you're an experienced belly dancer wanting to up your performance, this is a great DVD to buy!  It's designed to take you up to the next level.  If you're a beginner, this has ALOT of isolation technique work which will help to give you the fundamentals for you to learn belly dance seriously.<br /><br />Rachel Brice takes it slow, shows each move step by step and then slowly speeds it up so that you can follow it and enjoy--but boy those drills left me SORE!  Which is good because it meant that I was using muscles that I hadn't used before;)  The yoga helped me to stretch out my body, particularly my back, and was a great warm up.  Takes a bit of time, but I highly recommend this to any belly dancer who wants to learn more about technique, layering moves and wants to push herself to be the best dancer that she can be;)<br /><br />Johari
B0076DCT2G|1.0|The Kindle price is less than $2 difference with the Amazon hard cover price.  Why should I pay this much for an electronic book?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app but I made this review because it told me to and I would have felt bad if I didn't. :)
B00914JWSW|5.0|When I first heard about Release Me I thought that at last the non-album single releases (Happy Days '62, Our Corner of the Night, Frank Mills, etc.) that had only been found on 45 or youtube would finally be out on CD. Then I discovered she was releasing tracks that were NEVER before released in any format. The 11 tracks are either from projects that were never completed or from releases that needed some trimming. While these tracks did not merit release at the time they were recorded, they are each newly discovered gems that fit well together. Even better there will be a volume two according to Jay Landers' notes.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|I love this app on my phone but on my kindle doesn't sync with google and cant choose different calendars
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Obviously kindle readers are not true/real readers....therefore I would not take any review by a kindle reader seriously, nor would I ever believe a kindle review....see how a few people can ruin the reputation of a product/group.....The book is not available here yet, so when I get it, my review will be on the writing, not on what it is written on...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book can't wait to read book 3 when i finished book one I ran to the nearest bookstore to get the other ones
B008HK3XYK|3.0|Aesthetically, this product is terrific. I absolutely love the look and feel of it. The Kindle fits into it perfectly and can be put it and taken out easily.<br /><br />It's only OK because, unfortunately, the designer didn't think through the fact that, when the Kindle is in the case, it cannot be charged. The ports are inaccessible when the device is in the case and the case is closed. This is what keeps the product from earning 5 stars for me.
B00932AA5G|5.0|As a fan of Jo Nesbo's books this film is not about Harry Hole - but it is no less satisfying. The plot is engrossing and the twists keep coming ensuring that the viewer is constantly on the edge of their seat wondering where the story goes next. Yes there are subtitles, and yes it's a foreign film but if you usually don't cope with those elements you should still give this film a chance - especially if you're on the Prime program and can stream for free.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love it.. but would love it even more if it let you replay past boards, so you can collect power ups.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett once again displays his amazing writting skills. He masterfully educates and entertains in one story. He makes history interesting and reminds us all how fragile our political and social systems can be. We should never take personal freedom as a birthright. I sadly finish this trilogy and hope that Ken Follett will soon again apply his mind to the creation of a follow up siries. I am a waiting customer.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|The biggest problem I see with this movie, is the billing. I remember wanting to see this at the theater because I thought it was funny. It was billed as funny by all the commercials for this movie. But when you see it, it is really not a comedy. So I think a lot of people were under the wrong impression by how this was billed.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great graphics; lots of puzzles &amp; hidden pictures. Highly recommend. Can't put down until all the pieces have come together. Love Big Fish games. Well thought out in terms of story line and multi-level tasks.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really liked this game. The storyline was intriguing with the just the right amount of creepy and the graphics were amazing! My only complaint was the voice acting, it was very robotic and lacked a lot of emotion especially considering the situations these people were in. If they were to fix this the game would be perfect.
950742895X|5.0|I had this book before but I left it behind at my old place, now I wanted it again because it always helps me when I'm going trough a hard time, regarding the fact that I couldn't get it because of problems at the shipping process I highly recommend this book, one of the best.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The acting and special affects were great in this movie they definatley set the bar even my wife who is not into super hero movies loved t and wants to watch it again.
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|I have to join the other negative reviews--I was using this product and it was just fine for about six months then suddenly stopped working. Too pricey for a piece of junk, I'm going to buy another brand now.
0525952926|5.0|I could not wait for the second book in Ken Follett's century trilogy to become available. I recently re-read the \\"Fall of Giants\\" in anticipation of the release of \\"The Winter of the World\\". Ken's second book like its prequel puts the reader into the shoes and clothes of the men and women who lived through one of histories greatest tragedies.<br />While some of his characters are larger than life, most are ordinary folk. Jackie Jakes is an example.<br />The book weaves these fictional persons into the actuial events that marred the first half of the past century, and perhaps is still marring this century. It is a history lesson in full colour.  An epic telling of real events and ordinary men and women. There is no plotical point scoring. It is a tale of human courage. The characters, real and imagined are alive on the pages. The book is very hard to put down.<br />My recommendation, borrow it , buy it whatever. You will never regrett the few dollars you spend to obtain an insight of life and even death during these turbulent times.
0691152640|4.0|This book is certainly well written and researched. However, you should have a cursory knowledge of economics before attempting this book, otherwise you'll be stuck absent-mindedly reading charts and graphs you will have little understanding of. Overall a good read, but certainly not as an introductory book.

B002RXZF6C|5.0|More eloquent viewers than I have reviewed this classic, but I'll gladly put my two cents in as well.<br />If you have not seen this movie, please treat yourself and give it a try.  All of the actors do an excellent job.  Colin Clive as the brilliant Dr. Frankenstein, who allows his knowledge and creativity to carry him too far.  Dwight Frye as mean little Fritz, a part played to it's creepy hilt.  The first time I saw this film, Fritz scared me more than the \\"monster\\". Mae Clark as Dr. Frankenstein's fiance, forced to watch her true love descend into temporary madness, and unable to do anything about it.  And last but most certainly not least, the great Boris Karloff as the monster.  His is one of the greatest non-speaking roles I have ever witnessed.  He growls, but says not a word.  Yet he is able to convey a wide range of emotion through body posture, hand gestures, and though his facial expressions were limited due to heavy makeup, he manages it anyway.  Yes, his monster is frightening to a degree, but he also makes you feel pity for this poor creature--created by an unspeakable process, kept in the dark, unable to speak, and ultimately rejected by his creator.  The one friendship he makes ends tragically, and you must see this original, uncut version to understand what happens there.  It has always been my opinion that Boris Karloff should have won an Oscar for his performance as Frankenstein's monster.

B00406UK5A|4.0|A great movie for action and historic implications. Actors perform at their best when the pressure of being caught is amplified. The lead actress as you know is in the movie opposite N. Cage, Ghost Rider 2.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I don't know what people are using that they cant fit a C or D flashlight in in but I do with no probloms. I have been using this for over a year, I am a security guard for concerts and I carry my normal tactical flashlight and I slip my gloves though the outside piece. When I work out doors on overnight I switch to my 4D maglight and it stays no problem. the whole thing gets used and abused everyday
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I can't t say that I liked this book better than the first but I did really like it. This series surprised me from the beginning and has continued to keep me guessing what will happen next. I love the characters and where she took them in this book. Although I was disappointed with some of the twist and turns the book took it all made sense in the end. Can't wait for the next book.

If you are new to The XX after seeing them at festivals this year, then again, this is a brilliant album, but I would recommend getting their debut first.  That was a magnificient album not quite on the scale of Co-Exist, but not many albums are...

B008G8SFGO|5.0|As a fan since 1980, and I still have my Kiss lunch box from first grade, I was excited about this album and bought it on day 1.  It took me a few days to listen to it many times but I am now hooked.  I was expecting this to be worse than Sonic Boom because that was such a great album but Monster is just as good if not better.  I just ordered the vinyl version because I loved the cd so much.  It is a catchy, fun record.  Great job KISS!

B008LY9AWG|3.0|I like the way Michael Connelly thinks..........but short stories are harder to grab onto you.  I'm sure authors like to move away from the tried and true, but these stories, while 'fine' are just a good quick read- nothing to fall into.

B009QW7HMC|5.0|This series is one of the best works of art being produced right now.<br /><br />I love how it opens- this glimpse into what the group has been putting up with, for months- hide, kill, hide, just sit down to 2 cans of dog food for a whole group (Carl obviously considers this a find, Rick still recognizing the horror of just that)- not even 30 seconds rest, and everyone has to run again.<br /><br />LOVE how the writers have not lost touch with the groups environment; neglected yards for months in the deep south are not yards anymore- they simply become wild again. The characters stay dirty. Staying true to the filth in an apocalypse goes a long way to the gorgeous, convincing shots in this and other episodes.<br /><br />The prison isn't an option. The prison must be won. I'm already hooked, but just in case I wasn't, here comes Michonne!!<br /><br />Michonne is AMAZING already, of course, and this puts down alot of the sexist portrayal of women that had begun to concern me in the first 2 seasons. I do wish the writers could get over mother+baby=helpless paradigm and show that mothers are capable of more than just being needy drama queens completely dependent on men for the emotional and physical well-being of both themselves and their children. In reality the men are usually gone, and mothers must go to great lengths to fight for their children's survival.<br /><br />The action-packed disaster down those prison hallways, getting cut off, going wrong so fast- wow. My heart was pounding.<br /><br />And what an ending! I hope they stay true to the comic on this one, but in any case this show is an absolute work of art!
B007P06DOK|5.0|A very nice remaster with some great demos thrown in to boot. Does not compare to my old copy. All we can hope for now is another Graceland tour.

B004NSVF7C|4.0|I truly love books and seem to never have enough, but why is it about a book that brings me so much joy. Personally it is the opportunity to travel beyond myself and enter the intimate space of others.  Writer Allison Hoover Bartlett in her book The Man Who Loved Books Too Much: The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession discovered by accident the underworld market of book collectors.  Those who are in the business of sharing the best writing form gems of books that are worth lots of money.<br />In her uncovering this book market world she was surprise to discover the large amount of thief and forgery that goes on.  One case that she fell upon was that of John Gilkey, an unassuming fellow who was obsessed with books.  He wanted to own a well stocked library but he did not want to buy them, he wanted them for free.<br />Not only did Barlett find Gilkey and befriend him but he confessed his story to her and led her to her journalist ethical dilemma.  This book a fascinating read to the underground unethical world of the black market book trade. A great read for those who love books. It will also make you reassessed your own relationships with books.

The characters are so complete and beautiful and the storyline is just perfection.<br />In its own silent and brilliant way it sneaks in on you and I became so emotionally connected to the book that I cried so much at some points. Not like a tear in the corner of my eye, I cried my eyes out.<br />Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|I rather liked most of this film, with the exception of last 10 minutes, which were very weak and disappointing.<br /><br />I believe that it is hardly a SPOILER to say, that this film is basically about two genetists, Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley), colleagues, friends and lovers, who, after facing budget cuts decide to make an illegal experiment, by cloning a chimera made of a mixture of DNA from a human, animals and the DNA of a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO), a kind of huge worm, which they earlier (legally) created. The result of this illegal experiment will be a facinating quasi-human intelligent creature, a little girl, which with time, for reasons you have to discover yourself, they will call Dren (Delphine Chaneac). Some more limited SPOILERS ahead.<br /><br />Maybe it is because I have myself two young children, but rather than the SciFi elements I immediately rather focused on the child they brought to the world and what would become of her. Because they are afraid of consequences and still not certain if they will allow Dren to even live, Clive and Elsa hide her - and therefore ipso facto they keep her prisoner. Therefore, as far as my personal perception is concerned, this film is mostly about a little girl who was denied her childhood and who suffers for a extended period continuous abuse from her \\"parents\\" - or maybe rather should we call them her \\"abductors\\"?<br /><br />This is a sad film and a sad story and although Clive and Elsa try to bring some light into Dren's life, she nevertheless still lives in a prison, locked and watched by her gaolers. Being different from humans, she grows fast and as she enters the adolescence, she finally starts to rebel - as all adolescents do. And because of what she is, she has tools to rebel as no other adolescents have...<br /><br />This film is also a kind of study in double, mutual entrapment, because exactly as Dren is being kept under lock by her \\"parents\\", they are also stuck with her... Vincenzo Natali, who earlier made the quite impressive \\"Cube\\", leads this story very skillfully for almost the whole duration of the film and he rather intelligently describes Dren's late teens rebellion until a breaking point is reached and she severs her emotional links first with her \\"mother\\" and then, even more radically, with her \\"father\\". This liberation and coming of age (showed in a very Freudian scene between Dren and Clive) is quite beautifully symbolized by her deploying of wings... This final rebellion is also a punishment inflicted to both Clive and Elsa for their cowardly failure to provide the necessary love and care to the child they brought into this world...<br /><br />Sadly, at that moment the director took the film in the completely wrong direction and as the result, what could be a very honest SciFi philosphical tale, crashed and exploded in flames. The last 10 minutes of the film are horribly bad and do not make the slightest sense, at least as far as my personal taste is concerned. This is the reason, why I think this film desserves only three stars.<br /><br />But still, I do not regret that I watched it, as it has many touching moments and for most of its duration it is quite good. And it certainly touched me and made me think many times since about this little strange looking girl with a tail, living her sad, lonely existence locked in basements and barns. About Dren, who never got a chance...incenzo Natali, who earlier made the quite impressive \\"Cube\\", leads this story very skillfully for almost the whole duration of the film and he rather intelligently describes Dren's late teens rebellion until a breaking point is reached and she severs her emotional links first with her \\"mother\\" and then, even more radically, with her \\"father\\".

0345803485|1.0|I gavet this book one star because you can't go lower than that and I guess the fact that it got millions of women who have never read a book in their lives read all three well I guess  you could say it earned it. I was wondering before I saw some of the reviews if I was the only woman in America who thought this book was an insult to my intelligence. As a reader I knew from the beginning I was not going to read this trash, my girl friends begged and pleaded with me and I should have know since none of them reads.... I tried the first book and could not even get past the 15 percent mark. I swear I was listening to the fantasy of an 18 years old this book is so juvenile even the writing is simple and boring. Millions sold, sad to say but that says alot about our society, not enought sex and trash on TV now they are putting it in books. Please if you have any bit of standards in reading don't waste your time.

I'm thinking about skipping to the last couple of chapters just to see if the ending I am predicting comes to fruition.<br />If you read it exclusively for the sex, you may love this one.  If you are looking for storyline, you will probably be disappointed!
1439152802|5.0|It's time to praise Kate Morton again. Her new novel is another terrific example of powerful storytelling, and I loved it. As with her 3 previous books, we have two casts of characters, in the past and the present, and in this story we also get a well-detailed recreation of the dark days of the London Blitz in WWII and the eventful years following it. Laurel Nicholson and her mother, Dorothy, are vivid characters, and the secrets, lies, and dark deeds that make up the era-spanning plot kept me thoroughly engrossed. The final chapters are emotionally powerful, in light of what has gone before. But that's enough about this particular novel--now it's time to talk about the author.<br /><br />I've always loved the Gothic tradition of storytelling, family sagas with mysteries from the past and their effect on the present, and I especially love clear, intelligent, provocative prose. Kate Morton is one of the very, very few authors still working in this vanishing style, and that's both good and bad. It's bad because the tastes of the new generation of \\"modern\\" readers seem to be more for quick, punchy stories with lots and lots of action, and I wonder how much longer books like Morton's will find a market. But it's good because she's keeping alive the tradition that I (and a lot of other, mostly older readers) treasure.<br /><br />I'm a writer in my 50s, and I was brought up on Dickens, Austen, the Brontës, and more recent favorites like R. F. Delderfield, Rosamund Pilcher, Colleen McCollough, Robert Goddard, Diane Setterfield, and my all-time favorite writer, Daphne du Maurier. I guess I admire the long stories, with lots of interesting characters and a steady, detailed pace. I can't begin to tell you how important it is to me that we still have authors like Kate Morton among us. I look forward to her books, and she never disappoints. If you're a fan of traditional storytelling, or even if you're just looking for a break from the clatter and clamor of the \\"modern\\" stylesof writing, I urge you to give her novels a try. She is a champion on a dwindling field. Highly recommended.

Emily Blunt is a wonderful actress whether or not she plays the protagonist or antagonist [[ASIN:B000MKD9P6 The Devil Wears Prada]].  In this delightful romance I found the chemistry with her character and that of Ewan MacGregor a very sweet addition to the story of the salmon and how to get them to the Yemen.  Anyone with a taste for British humor as displayed in movies such as [[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)]]or [[ASIN:B00320J6WS Pirate Radio]]will probably enjoy this movie.

Even the score is awful.<br /><br />What possessed Ridley Scott to film such a lousy script and produce arguably the WORST film in the Alien franchise? Prometheus is an enormous disappointment after Scott's excellent 'Alien'.<br /><br />Avoid!

0316228532|5.0|I am a huge fan of \\"Harry Potter\\"... I'm talking HUGE--As in, I've read all the books several times and I listen to the audio books often.  Most people have the radio, I listen to Grammy Award Winning Jim Dale read J.K. Rowling's seven-book masterpiece.  That being said, I was excited and at the same time very wary when news broke that Rowling was writing a new book unrelated to Harry Potter.  How could she measure up to a standard she had already set so high, and in a genre so different from what she's always written?<br /><br />I need not have worried.  \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" starts out slow, much like spending time with the Dursleys, but she's introducing vital information that sets up the story.  Rowling shows the reader just how well she knows people.  She gets into their heads (and yours) and shows you exactly how a group of citizens think of the poor, the addicted, the rich, the activists, the young, the old, the abusive, the complacent, etc.  The perspectives she shows the readers are shocking, honest, humorous, gut-wrenchingly sad, and eye-opening.  It's one of those books that will have you thinking for days after you finish it.<br /><br />Don't miss this gift Rowling has given us.  Read it all the way to the end.  If you don't chuckle, get furious, and tear up at the injustice of it all, then you're not reading it right.  She reminds us what it means to be part of a community--to be human--and how important it is for us to help each other.

160309007X|1.0|The cover-flap gag ads are the best part of this weak conclusion to the \\"Century\\" storyline. This too-thin volume merely drops the moon-child into the plot without any reason for us to loathe or fear him. Allan and Mina also enter the plot nearly as quickly as they exit it, once again, I felt nothing for them or their plight. Orlando dominates the plot, but his/her arc seems cheap and shallow. Every popular-culture reference seems strained and obligatory. In the earlier League volumes, Moore had managed to weave some magic around the popular mythology of forgotten characters...none of that is here. And it goes without saying that the means by which the moon-child is eventually defeated will leave most readers scratching their heads and disappointed.<br /><br />It seems to me that Moore had big plans for the League when he envisioned this multivolume arc, but just got sick of it and truncated the plot instead of resolving it.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|excellent movie<br />would surely recommend this to  friends to watch<br />love the actors<br />great movie costumes<br />love the makeup<br />missed it at the movies so waited for it to come out on dvd
B004LWZW4C|4.0|X-Men: First Class gets the opening exactly right. It returns to the same scene that opened the first X-Men movie, so we see, again, young Erik Lehnsherr being dragged away from his parents in a Nazi concentration camp. We get slightly more of what happens to Erik, this time, though, and we also get to meet Sebastian Shaw, played expertly by Kevin Bacon.<br /><br />However, from there, the movie bounces around and forward through time and feels a little rushed. Like there was more they should have been showing but had to cut it all out. That's always difficult when they're trying to provide enough back story and introduce several characters all at the same time, and they almost pulled it off smoothly, but not quite. Things (mostly) smooth out when we get to the present day of 1962. Oliver Platt gets a role, and, I have to say, I love Oliver Platt, so it was a joy to see him in  the movie. Rose Byrne, of Bridesmaids, is in as Moira MacTaggert, and she is also quite good.<br /><br />The main failing of the movie may just be a failing in me, although I'm not convinced. It might be one caused by the studio, in  this case Fox, not Marvel, not really knowing what audience they want to target. Marvel seems to have worked this out, for the most part, in  their own movies, but the X-Men franchise seems to be struggling with it. The conflict lies in how to deal with fans of the actual comic books. If you stray too far from the comics, the fans get into an uproar, but, sometimes, if you stay too close to the comic, the broader audience won't go see the movie at all (I could be wrong, but I think Warner Brothers is about to have this problem with Green Lantern (which is not to say that the movie's not going to have a big opening, but I think that may be where it ends)). When movies adapted from comics first started getting popular, that's how the studios approached it, balancing fans against people that never read comics, people who only knew of the characters peripherally. I'mfinding my issue lies in a third area, that group of people that at one time followed comics but has been away from them for an extended length of time. This is the audience, the nostalgia audience, that Fox keeps messing up with. And it's a much larger audience than the audience of current fans. These are the people with the kids who, if the movie is good, will take their kids back to the same movie over and over again.<br />All of that to say that one particular character in the movie really bothered me. Bothered me to the extent that it was distracting to me. For someone currently following the X-Men comics, this character shouldn't be an issue, but, as I watched the movie, not having even looked inside an X-Men comic published in the last decade, I couldn't see Azazel as more than a cheap Nightcrawler rip off. That character, in particular, decreased my enjoyment of the movie, because Nightcrawler has always been one of my favorite X-Men.<br /><br />Of course, I came home and did my background research before I started this post and discovered Azazel is a character that's been introduced since my sojourn in the comic book world ended. And he's such a Nightcrawler rip off because he's, yes, Nightcrawler's father. I won't go into my issues with that, since they have nothing to do with the movie. Most people, though, aren't going to go home after the movie and look up the character and find out there's a (unspoken) reason he's in the film. Again, maybe my reaction is just mine, but I would be surprised.<br /><br />The only real failing of the movie is that it succumbs to that long held movie tradition of the crash course training event whereby a completely untrained individual or group becomes expert at what they're doing in a matter of moments. In this case, the training of the X-Men lasts an entire week, and they actually comment on it during the movie, \\"Look at what we've accomplished in just a week...\\" For a movie that spans 18 years, you'd think they'd have worked out a better way than to cram all the training into that last week of the storyline, but no... It's unfortunate.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a good movie. Fox seems to have learned from its mistakes with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, although they may have also created some continuity issues between the two movies. Maybe they'll work those out at some point, but I doubt it. Now that I know Azazel is a real character, I'd actually go see it again. There's a lot to absorb in a movie like this, and it would just be nice to watch it without getting prickly every time Azazel pops onto the screen.<br /><br />As for the cast and characters, as I already implied, Kevin Bacon made an excellent villain. He's undervalued as an actor, so it's good to see him in a high profile role, again.<br /><br />January Jones is perfectly cast as Emma Frost, the white queen of the Hellfire Club. She goes from the role of the ice queen Betty Draper (Mad Men) to embodying that image literally. She doesn't show a lot of range, but, then, she doesn't need to.<br /><br />James McAvoy is a pleasure as Professor X, or, really, just Charles. There are glimmers of the character as performed by Patrick Stewart in McAvoy's performance, and, really, what more can you ask for than that? The only issues with the character come from the writing and not the acting. The issue stems from the desire to create a more basic conflict between Charles and Eric than one just of method. They play Xavier not just as wanting peaceful co-existence between mutant and human but as wanting the humanizing of mutants. Not that he wants them to not be mutants, but he wants them to be indistinguishable from humans. He sort of comes off as a bigot in this respect.<br /><br />The purist is, of course, Magneto. He believes in embracing mutantness, and, well, if you've seen the other X-Men movies, you know where this goes. Michael Fassbender does an admirable job in the role. Once he dons the helmet, he even rather looks like Ian McKellen.<br /><br />It was nice to see Banshee included. He's another of those X-Men that I really like that's often overlooked. He's an interesting character that they're really never delved into enough, so it was cool to see him in the mix. Caleb Jones did an adequate job in the role, but, honestly, I just kept seeing Rupert Grint superimposed in the role.<br /><br />Which brings us to Jennifer Lawrence. I'm sure all of you fans of The Hunger Games have been wondering when I'd get to her. Unfortunately, I don't have anything really positive to say about her. No raving about her performance. There's also nothing bad to say about her performance; it just wasn't anything that stood out. Possibly, the role didn't require anything of her other than to stand around and be herself, look pretty, but Mystique never really came into focus. There was a lack of emotional intensity that should have been present.<br /><br />Oh, and there's an awesome Wolverine cameo. That alone is almost worth the movie even if it had been horrible. Since it wasn't horrible, the Wolverine cameo really is icing on the cake. Not awesome cake, but good cake. With awesome icing.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Wonderful, realistic, almost haunting interpretation of a turning-point time in history. Lyrical writing, excellent character development.... I could go on & on.... Loved this book & didn't want it to end. Highly recommend!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Once you realize that the world of Suckerpunch is presented to you as seen by a shattered young mind struggling to make sense of a horrible situation, you have to step back and ponder what the visions really mean.  As her emotions play across the screen in a psychotropic tableau, stop and ponder... Is the asylum really an ex-dancehall doubling as an after-visiting-hours brothel?  Or does Babydoll just interpret her therapies and mistreatments that way to glamorize her otherwise horrendous situation?  Now... what is real and what isn't?  And when it is obvioulsy not real, what is really going on?<br /><br />That's the real SuckerPunch.<br /><br />I suspect the critics pan any movie that might take more concentration than a mind, fresh from a three-drink dinner, can handle.<br /><br />Spectacular, mind-twisting eye-candy?  You better believe it!<br /><br />More please!
B003FK8V7G|5.0|I hadn't heard Gaslight Anthem until I picked up a copy of American Slang.  This is one of the best albums of 2010.  It's that simple.  So buy a copy already.  No, not a used copy.  Get a new one for yourself. Or maybe two, because then you won't be too pissed when you loan it to that girl you like and then never see it again after you're done with her.

B004GTLVIQ|5.0|I have read all of Diana Gabaldon's books in this series 3 times in book form and now have purchased all of them for my Kindle. I absolutely love them I am transported to the time and place I can hear the sounds and smell the smells she writes so descriptively. I am anxiously waiting for the next book.
0345803485|1.0|My sister sent me the trilogy of \\"Fifty Shades of Horrible,\\" thinking I would love the books as she and her circle of friends did. I could barely read the first page without groaning out loud and feeling an urge to either rip the thing in two or hurl it against the wall.<br /><br />I am an author and I have judged many book contests. How on earth did this book ever get published, let alone become a bestseller? Has the world gone mad? Has the average IQ dropped to two digits? Am I living in a parallel universe where people actually mature past puberty?<br /><br />I knew nothing about the books at all when I received them, as I follow no media. The title was intriguing. Then I began reading, and my brain flopped like a fish out of water. I flipped to the cover where it said: BESTSELLER. I flipped back to reading and confirmed that yes, it really IS this bad, and yes, it really IS a bestseller. It is a marvel to me that a book so ghastly, sophomoric, unedited (apparently), unbelievable (one must be able to suspend one's disbelief) was ever published. I slogged through the first book out of courtesy to my sister, able to stomach only a page or two at a time, scanning much of it (especially the badly written erotica), and groaning, groaning, groaning at all the literary lameness (for example):<br /><br />1. Hideous protagonist, Ana. She is a formless blob, and we are to believe at her age she does not own any technology, is a virgin who explodes instantly into having orgasms at the drop of a hat (or a sideways glance), and unwittingly snares a billionaire beauty who can have whomever he desires.<br /><br />2. The hideous writing. Murmur . . . mutter  . . . roll her eyes . . . bite her lip . . . holy hell . . . AARRRRGH!<br /><br />3. Fifty shades of ridiculous: Christian. There are too many unrealistic and unbelievable aspects of his character to list here. I'll name one: he, the high-powered rich and beautiful businessman, falls in love with a formless blob. (Did anyoneelse take note of the copper--red--hair?)<br /><br />4. Hideous dialogue, bad grammar, sophomoric situations . . . AAARRRRGH!<br /><br />Did a teenager write this? Please someone, tell me how any person could love this book. If it's for the sex, I can only imagine there is better erotica (there must be, or how could the genre even exist?).<br /><br />I'm flummoxed.
1451673442|5.0|I have too many great things to say! Our lives have changed immensely since buying this book.  Everybody should have one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been a long time user of evernote on my ios, android,pc,mac and kindle fire products. I just love how they continue to add great features to the app without taking the core idea away namely yor notes on the cloud. They have constantly improved the look and feel of their UI. Their clous sync works great all the time. Strongly recommend it.
B007704HO6|4.0|I loved it.  I'm not a cat owner, but my mother and sister are.  So I loved reading this story.  Many of their experiences with their cats are similiar.  It was wonderful to read a story about how owning a cat can change your life for the better.  Truly, animals are amazing.  And Bob is at the top. I'll probably buy this for my mother in book form as she doesn't have a Kindle. She wouldn't be able to relate to the drug addition, but would love Bob's healing effect on James, as she feels her cat has added so much to her life, also.
0143119680|5.0|Mystifying, imaginative, and innovative. I'm amazed by how well the author tied in non-fictional historical facts with her fictional love story of a witch and a vampire. I would recommend this story to anyone who loves a story that takes you somewhere.
0545405777|4.0|I lucked up and found this for less than $5.00 at Amazon.  Since I was buying a class set, I would love to have been able to purchase enough for that set.  However, I was limited to buying only four copies.  The book itself works well with my class.  The paper is trade edition, and the cuts on the side are uneven.  However, that really doesn't matter for a class of ninth and tenth graders.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|match three game. great graphics. easy to use. fun for all ages. I would recommend this game. I have tried others and this is the best I have found.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) has spent his career catering to the demanding tenants of the posh apartment tower he works in, but when he finds out that one of the residents, Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) , an investment broker, had defrauded him and the rest of the rank-and-file staff out of their pensions, he gets the idea to rob Shaw's `nest egg' and gathers a rag-tag group of individuals to help.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I expected when I started watching `Tower Heist', but I actually found it quite a fun heist-comedy to sit through. Drawing on our sympathy for the working stiff that gets screwed over - which, sadly, happens a lot these days - made our band of mismatched average Joes that much more endearing to watch and we can't help but root for them as they go about planning and preparing the whole heist. Alan Alda also doesn't let the film down by making Arthur Shaw a despicable character, I mean peel back the layers and Shaw's just rotten, the kind of villain we love to hate.<br /><br />While Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Michael Pena and Gabourey Sidibe were pretty funny, I couldn't help but find Eddie Murphy's Slide a little annoying, I mean I know it's just Eddie doing his thing, but I just didn't see the humour in his antics. Still, the comedy wasn't over-the-top and it hit the right notes and gave us a few laughs. As much as I enjoyed it, though, I can't recommend this for a purchase. It's worth a watch, but it's also pretty forgettable by the end.<br /><br />The DVD includes two alternate endings, one of which I thought could've worked, the other; no way. There's also a handful of delete/alternate scenes - I always enjoy seeing what's cut out of a film - and an alright gag-reel and commentary track.
B0088X7YMS|4.0|Okay I am a huge fan of Starship Troopers the novel and loved the Roughnecks series, I really hated the original movie since it has very little in common with Heinleins novel, so I really liked Invasion, they still havent gotten the Power Armor right and the weapons but at least they are better than what they had in Verhoevens craptastic movie, which someone has finally gotten smart and decided to remake and do the novel. Now if they would just do Steakleys book \\"Armor\\" as well.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Game is well designed and fun. Nice graphics, music, and game play.  The only thing I do not like is the constant pop ups to review the app and try their new apps.
B006ATJXQW|1.0|I thought the first book was awesome, but after that it seemed that James was running out of ideas for a story line. All this book had was disaster after disaster with no good story plot, to the point that I was rolling my eyes with every new attack or disaster. Tip to authors: Too many disasters is going to make your story more boring, not exciting. I started wishing for everyone to just die and be done with it. There was no hope, nothing to look forward to.<br /><br />I was forewarned that this book had nothing to do with the rest of the series, so I wasn't expecting the story to really connect, but I was at least expecting some kind of story. This was no story. I understand that teen boys like lots of violence and action, so maybe that's what he was going for. I, however, would be disappointed if my teen boy was this dense.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I had a lot of fun watching this movie. The music was great and so was the singing and more than one laugh. Just when I thought Tom Cruise couldn't get any hotter, he proves me wrong. I loved it.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|My iPhone video cable works perfectly and I have yet to see the error message that other reviews have described. The screen resolution for most applications such as Netflix, apps from network TV stations, etc, appear on screen in better, much clearer resolution than what can be seen on my iPhone when viewing without using the cable or a TV screen. I have not had a chance to see if any presentation apps like the iPhone version of a PowerPoint viewer would work with this cable yet, but would be interested to hear from anybody who has tried this to see if it works.<br /><br />The only complaints I have are that when using the cable to charge my phone from a USB port on my TV, the sound of the phone is dissabled so it does not ring for incoming calls or alarm clock settings. Any time this cable is plugged in, there is no sound from the phone other than from the video on screen, so no alerts, calls, text notification sounds and so forth. Also, many application developers still do not use the video-out features that the iPhone is capable of, such as my cable provider (\\"Time Warner Cable\\" has an app for watching a number of available cable channels while within home wi-fi range, but it does not allow external monitor viewing as needed for use with this cable).<br /><br />For those who mainly use or want something like this for using Netflix, Youtube and purchased or downloaded videos saved on your iPhone, it works very well and is a 5-star product.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|first and foremost I liked the g13, seemed well built with some cool features, what I didn't like about it is the size of it, I have medium sized hands and it dwarfed them. other then that, it was pretty nice.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was great! It held my interest and was full of twists and turns! However, I thought the ending was very boring and not what I expected to happen.
0316212377|4.0|I really enjoy the Culture series - and I'm not lying when I say this, because (and let's be honest here), it's an interesting premise - but as I continue to read this - interesting, if somewhat loopy, - book, I keep getting hung up on a pattern that emerges paragraph after - and let's be honest here, because I'm not making this up - paragraph.<br /><br />Get the idea? I think he reached critical density in regards to asides, commentary, mentions in passing, etc. Does it detract from the story? A little, yeah. Could I have done any better? Come on, this is the guy that came up with the Culture. He's a cool dude.<br /><br />The story's been interesting so far. I'm about 2/3 of the way through and plugging along quite well. I'd just be able to enjoy it more without the constant hyphens and comma after comma after comma after comma as characters discuss things, discuss each other, discuss discussing, etc.<br /><br />When this comes down in price to around $6 or $7 (if it does) I think the dollar to value ratio will improve. I bought it at the $12.99 price because I'm a sucker for the Culture.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|What an awesome product!  The look of this on my shelf really...brings the room together?  Maybe?  It's awesome.  Buy it.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I liked the first album, just liked....I was hesitant to purchase this one, but after hearing the samples it just felt different. Halcyon is now one of my favorite albums! The sound and vocals are so uniqe and beautiful, it's worth the purchase if you're a fan of Ellie or a first time listener.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Fans of Jeff Lynne and ELO have waiting many years for new music.  When it finally got here I was a little disappointed to hear it was an album of covers.  Why would one of the best songwriter/singer/producer in the world do other peoples music???  It's because these are the kind of songs that got him interested in music to begin with.  On the first listen to the album I had to take back all my disappointment.  These songs are amazing!!  Never in a million years would I have thought I'd listen to a song like \\"Love is a Many Splendored Thing\\".  I was all set for \\"ho hum, Andy Williams boring\\" but it turns out Jeff does a fantastic job of making a standard a modern marvel.  When I listen to \\"Mercy, Mercy\\" it sounds like it could have been written yesterday instead of almost 50 years ago.  Simply amazing. Don't listen to the haters of all music who post the 1 star reviews here.  Jeff's voice sounds better than it ever has.  Some of the old rock guys'voices are toast, but his has mellowed with time and is sounding great.  Don't miss the album!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|if I paid $30 id be disappointed but for free seems great to me.<br />sometimes selects an adjacent piece but you can always use undo.

1451627289|5.0|What more can be said, simply the best book he's written. The story is so perfectly crafted and executed you can't be disappointed.  One of the best books I've ever read.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got this app free from the free app of the day. I love the way there is a puzzle involved with seeking the objects.
1441761268|5.0|Loved it. The characters were richly woven and colorfully drawn so that you felt as though you really knew each of them. I loved the behind the \\"big house\\"  view of life on this tobacco plantation and the plot was intricately pulled out so that you never really saw all the curve balls coming at you. And I respected the way the author didn't try to tidy up the ending with our hero and heroine riding off into the sunset together. This was on my reading list for months- I only regret that I didn't read it sooner.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Mildred Pierce is an excellent film, pulling you in from the first frame and not letting you go until those two words THE END fade from the screen. Reminiscent of the classic Fred MacMurray/Barbara Stanwyck classic Double Indemnity, the movie keeps you in suspense all the way through, and the final revelation is a real shocker. There are light moments of comedy sprinkled throughout, which are clean, and I won't say anymore, lest I spoil the surprise.<br /><br />Watch this movie. You won't regret it.<br /><br />Not Rated (no objectionable material).
0425263908|2.0|I liked 50 Shades of Gray better -- although I did read this book quickly.  It is good, but it had kind of the same theme -- rich man, abusive childhood, etc. - falls for - woman HEAD over heels.  I wonder how often that really happens in life?? ha ha  The men always have nightmares - and the woman saves them.
0307408833|1.0|I bought this book with the hopes that the recipes would live up to the reputation of the bakery and photos in the book. I am a experienced baker and have been extremely disappointed with the recipes.  I agree with several of the other reviewers that the frosting recipe does not live up to expectations and have tried it several times and have repeated other recipes multiple times to the exact specifications with disappointing results.  If you read the comments in the book, there is a lot of hype of how family, friends and clients rave about the recipe listed.  In my opinion, the recipes fall very short, not worth purchasing.
034580404X|4.0|This trilogy was a very entertaining fun read. My wife and I enjoyed reading it together. Hope you enjoy it too.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I cannot read this series fast enough. Love the twists and turns of the plot and the speculation of what will happen next. Can hardly wait for the new HBO season.

0596809158|5.0|I am using R from time to time, to process data from computer system performance testing. Not more than few hours a month.

Frequently, this is something that I did in the past, but I don't remember details.<br /><br />This book provides necessary support.

B005H5H3LW|2.0|I've no way of knowing personally whether or not any or all of the creative folk behind SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO grew up as fans of the 70's anime program of the same name.  I think it's a safe bet that they were.  (I wasn't a faithful watcher, but I caught it from time to time.)  After all, why resurrect the popular property after all this time if not a fan of it?  One would think that fandom and film projects go hand-in-hand, but maybe - just maybe - that worked against this 2010 film adaptation.  Perhaps it could've used some new and uninitiated hands at the reins in order to produce a better product.<br /><br />In 2199, Earth has been all but decimated, the results of a five-year war with the Gamilas.  Indeed, the surface of the once green planet has been irradiated, and survivors are left to fend for themselves in the subterranean world below.  When a chance message from the stars reveals that a cure for our planet's radiation may wait on a distant world named Iskandar, the Earth Defense Force does the unthinkable: they launch our last battleship into space with hopes that this one last team can uncover the remedy and return it to save humanity from certain doom.<br /><br />It's a great premise - one that has fueled countless sci-fi properties throughout the years - and much of YAMATO carries it off stylistically to great success.  In fact, one could argue that setting a feature of this type aboard a `battleship' is more than a bit inspired as it gives set designers and dressers a chance to work with far more `homegrown' settings.  I'd imagine quite a bit of the production budget for such films as STAR WARS and the ALIEN franchise goes into building ships - with their various rooms and settings - that look as if they're part of a future technology, but a good amount of YAMATO resembles ships of our time: destroyers, battleships, frigates, etc.  You rent out a decommissioned ship, throw up a fresh coat of paint, splash up a few futuristic graphics, and viola!  Spaceship!<br /><br />Arguably, that's the appeal of YAMATO, probably stretching back to the days of its infancy.  It always seemed like a closer tomorrow than, say, STAR TREK or ALIEN as those environments were clearly a distant future.  It's an inspired choice, one rooted in present technology as well as it is things to come.  However, it's a sound conclusion that didn't gel with the entirety of the film.<br /><br />Special effects here are, actually, downright disappointing at times.  Fighter craft tend to zip and scoot and flip and bebop around much the way they do in anime, and that's entirely incredulous when shown alongside the grim, utility-like images of the YAMATO.  In the world of STAR TREK, technology like `inertial dampeners' make it possible for man to survive in the high-tech environment of warp-speed and futuristic combat craft, but that healthy grounding in a real, relatable science seems to be at a loss to the crew bringing YAMATO to the big screen.  It's almost as if these space fighters `skid' through open space when their movements are decidedly cartoonish.<br /><br />And ... who knows?  Maybe that's precisely what the producers wanted, given the fact that YAMATO is based on an anime.  Maybe they wanted - much like elements of DICK TRACY did a while back - to essentially deliver a live-action-adaptation of a cartoon with all of its cartoonish elements specifically to throw viewers back to those days of the TV adventure.  If that's the case, then they may've succeeded, as the ship's Wave Motion Cannon looks decidedly much like it did on the boob tube.  I would've expected (and hoped) for something better - a contemporization of the beloved TV show instead of something so similar - or, at least, something that built on the program while still serving reverence to it.  Instead, the viewer is treated to some decidedly low budget effects visuals (albeit there's some smart cinematography here) more akin to computer games than they are a tent-pole franchise property.<br /><br />Still, the YAMATO - in all its militaristic grace - sure looked good out there.  Instead of B-movie status given here, I'd rather they gave it an A-movie upgrade, complete with characters far more dimensional than these carbon-copy fighter pilots and their hokey TOP GUN camaraderie.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED.  Meh.  I think it's a failure, but what a glorious failure indeed!  SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO looks and sounds mostly the way fans of anime would probably expect a filmed adaptation to look and sound - entirely harmless, covered in sugar to its cinematic roots, with plenty of flash and sizzle for the young-at-heart.  At best, there's a basic story of good-versus-evil here, though much of it is buried under C-grade special effects seen on shooter games in the late 90's; and, at worst, you could find hundreds of worse ways to kill 138 minutes.  As I said, I never cut my teeth on the televised anime in my youth, but, if I had, this might've been right up my alley.ise property.<br /><br />Still, the YAMATO - in all its militaristic grace - sure looked good out there.

B008WCP2KG|4.0|There are people giving this bad feedback.  It was never meant to qualify for an Oscar.  It was meant for fun, mostly for women, and it definitely delivers.  I saw it twice and enjoyed it both times.  Can hardly wait for the Blu-ray to come out so I can see the complete dances.  Women never get movies made for them, but men always do.  Ignore the low feedback reviews and rent the movie if you want to see it, but be sure to rent the Blu-ray copy.  That's the one that's going to be the most fun.  Personally, I want this around so I can drool any time I want to...some gorgeous men in there.
145168939X|4.0|This was my first time reading a book written by this author.  I wanted to read it before seeing the movie because I had heard people say they liked the movie, but didn't understand it.  I enjoyed the book, and it did help with my understanding of the movie.  It's not your typical hollywood adventure that's for sure.

I sat down with it and got about half way through and decided to see what other people thought about the book.  OK, so I'm not the only one who thinks this book belongs no where else but the trash bin!  But I read on thinking there has to be a point to all the swearing and \\"shagging\\".  Nope!  I finished the book and its in the trash where it belongs.  I've never read a more pointless book in my life.  Again, what was she thinking???

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is great for both children 12+ to adults. I read it to gauge whether to add it to my fifth grade classroom library, and came away wishing I had copies for the whole class. The novel is told from multiple perspectives (great for teaching POV) and would be a great springboard for discussion about acceptance, bullying, middle school, being true to yourself...Truly an extraordinary book. A great, realistic story, that will make you laugh, cry, and identify with each of the characters. A sequel would be a dream come true!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great app.  Graphics a+.  New twist on old game.  Over 2 mil in bejewled, but not bored with this yet.  Highly recommend.  Not easy.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app seems really boring but I have honestly spent hours of addictive fun enjoying it! GET IT!!! :) It is one of my most used apps in my kindle.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a very warm story that takes your heart through the mind of a boy named Charlie, who makes new friends, has new experiences, and even expands on Leo Buscaglia's ideas of being fully human. He is an intelligent and compassionate young man gray you fall in love with at the very beginning.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I just don't feel its finished, and I am upset by that! It took awhile to get into the story, and then for it to end that way. It is disappointing
B0071LLHGC|5.0|People say this is a bootleg.  The inner sleeve says its kosher.  It sounds a LOT better than the .mp3s I downloaded some time back.  If it's not legit, then my apple-ogies to Gregg and Co.  It's a brilliant performance and sounds excellent.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook. I love to play the games, and to look at the cute pictures that others post.I also can keep in touch with friends from other states. And if your lucky you make new friends.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|freaking addictive...... I lose time playing this game..... I really should stop playing and do some laundry or something productive, but here I am still in my jammies playing :)
006113127X|5.0|Factotum is simply a book that will just cut you out of reality for a while, for me i chose to read just when i had time or mainly just awkward times when i didn't have time, luckily the book is made so as long as you know where you stopped you can jump right in and exit reality. The book it self is really an autobiographical account of Charles's life in his twenties. Just he mainly worked shitty dead end jobs and drank and smoke incessantly. Not to mention being quite promiscuous and even managed to get crabs haha. I wouldnt consider this The Great Gatsby but it really does hold its own because nothing really helps you escape like a good book and Factotum definitely does. This book would really be recommended to any male artist who enjoys to party, thats all i can say.<br />Beau
B0088749CW|1.0|This movie is not what the trailers portray it to be.  I'm on the fence about this movie... seriously. It's not a Serial Killer movie. However, I will say as a credit to this movie, the cinematography was absolutely stunning! The storyline is very interesting and gripping.  As it may be, I was very disappointed in the final summarization and or ending of this movie. This movie was (NOT) what I expected! However, don't buy it. This is NOT and Ideal (buy it) kind of movie. I'm afraid it's best to RENT this movie. But for the sake of just \\"pure entertainment\\"...it's ok, but not worth buying. Again, to make this review stupid proof, I will state again, \\"it's NOT a serial Killer movie!\\" This means boring. Ok, thanks.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The YouVersion Bible app is great for daily reading and also Sermon preparation. I love that the search engine for this app is not just a concordance but also a topical search.  It also makes it convenient for daily Bible reading.  The only glitch I see is that I cannot remove old book marks.  I try to remove one and tells me it has been removed but remains on the list.

B004J4WLB4|3.0|The beginning is OK, but the story gets real drawn out and I lost interest.  I finished it by skimming over the middle and end to see if the ending would pick up my interest again and it did not.  Too bad.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Probably my favorite Argento movie, along w/ Deep Red and Opera. Visually stunning movie and the creepy music makes it even better. I would recommend this movie. Great Italian horror!

B003YV64OI|4.0|Bought this to be able to play Minecraft atleast on Normal render distance and it did its job averaging 40+ FPS. Initially, I had a Radeon HD 5750 with a single core crap CPU and I tried playing Minecraft, but only averaged 10 FPS but when I plugged this baby in, WOW! Everythig was smooth and clear. but not enough to play it on FAR. For some reason it just doesnt want to go above 20 FPS but who cares, Normal is good enough for someone whos had to play on Tiny for 2 years.<br /><br />Overall, I'm super happy with this super fast CPU. Not once has it ever gone above 75% usage on any core.<br /><br />The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because of the fan and the heat sink. The heat sink is tiny and the fan, o boy, the fan. The fan seems to be grinding againsts something because it makes some sort of noise and it doesn't fast enough. I checked out the speed and only averages less than 1000 rpm's and get the CPU HOT!!!. I've had several occasions where I'd play some games and the whole computer shutting down because it just got too hot. So for now, I stopped playing games so it doesn't stress out the CPU. So what I'm doing is having to buy thermal paste and reuse my old fan for the CPU which does around 2000 rpm's and cools it down to a relatively low temperature.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|ads are ANNOYINGandEXCESSIVE to the point I dont want to play! THREE ads before THREE more before I can see theirs.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|When first receiving the product all of the individual pieces did not come completely assembled but based on the pictures, I put them together. The directions to putting the actual device together is a little scarce on the words and the pictures are not in color so it is hard to see which side of the pieces connect.<br /><br />The device itself is easy to use though but as you score, small shards of glass come off so score over a table cloth or... I would do the whole process on a cookie sheet lined with a placemat. I found that if you rush the scoring, your bottle will unevenly crack making the cut jagged, so apply even pressure and score slowly.<br /><br />The key to getting the score through the glass and the bottom to come off is to SWIRL the bottle in the water. Just submerging the bottle and leaving it there for a few seconds will take longer.<br />- Slowly swirl the bottle in your pot of simmering water for about 6-7 seconds (one complete swirl per second) and also do the same technique in the cold water. Repeat if needed but I never had to do it more than twice. Another key, make sure your ice water is a good 30% ice to water ratio. The colder the ice, the faster and better the score goes through. Pops right off. After a few bottles you learn to listen to when the bottle is going to separate.<br /><br />The bottle tap I never used. I think it's called (F).<br /><br />Overall 30/40 bottles cut evenly. Not too bad.
1439152802|4.0|Set alternately between the present and the past, much of this mystery novel takes place in London during the Blitz, when the Luftwaffe bombed the UK for fifty-seven consecutive nights, killing over 40,000 civilians. Laurel Nicholson, a successful actress in her sixties, reflects back to her teen years in the 1960's and a crime she witnessed her mother, Dorothy (now ninety and dying), commit outside their Greenacres farmhouse.<br /><br />The Blitz years' sections belong to Dorothy, which Laurel pieces together from scraps of memorabilia that her mother possesses. It opens up to the reader as Dorothy's story, primarily. As Laurel and her siblings gather for Dorothy's last days, the reader follows the trail of clues revealed through memories, inquiry, and Laurel's amateur sleuthing. As the pages turn, we get more involved and intrigued by the intertwined lives of Dorothy, a woman from Dorothy's past named Vivien (and Vivien's husband, Henry Jenkins), and Dorothy's former beau, Jimmy.<br /><br />The most engaging aspect of this book is the smooth narrative and the intimate voices of the past and present. Morton creates characters that stand out, especially those from the WW II period. Dorothy is a complex woman trying to carve a future from the fear and impermanence that wartime creates. You can fairly hear the explosions in the background. Vivien is an enigmatic woman who never ceases to pique the reader's interest, and her husband, Henry, the celebrated author, adds to the curiosity. Jimmy, the photographer and Dorothy's love interest, is the moral center.<br /><br />What kind of relationship did Dorothy and Vivien have? Were they friends, or adversaries, or mere acquaintances? There's a photo of them standing together, emanating defiance and daring. But the more the photo is brought to light, the more the women in the picture elude Laurel.<br /><br />Laurel is driven and defined by the answers she seeks more than her life as an actress, which is secondary to the story. Although there is a murder mystery, it reads as a family saga. She decides to engage her scientist brother, who was there when the tragedy happened, (in his mother's arms--as a toddler) to help her solve the answer to their mother's secret.<br /><br />But first, Laurel has to tell him how she witnessed the scene from her hiding place in the tree house, watching while her mother placed the heirloom knife next to the birthday cake, readying for a family celebration, while Laurel dreamed the dreams of a typical yet gifted sixteen-year-old, secluded from the main action of her family and the outsider who intruded.<br /><br />As a family and historical drama, it was often engrossing. However, Morton did not surprise me with the big disclosures, or catch me off guard, although she clearly intended to keep us guessing. It was less about my fortuitous abilities and more about Morton's transparency. I read a review of her first book that stated she tipped her hand too soon and too conspicuously, which is done here, also. It is the one trait that tends to undermine an otherwise very pleasant read, a book that fits well with a cozy, plush chair next to a crackling fire on a damp day with a cup of hot English tea warming your hands.ry.

B001ER4CNY|4.0|I started watching I DREAM OF JEANNIE in re-runs with my sister about 10 years ago, and immediately liked the series. SInce I love and cherish history and pop culture of yesteryear, I took it upon myself to get as many of my favorite series as possible on DVD to share with my own family in the future; I DREAM OF JEANNIE is one of those series.<br />I originally bought the first season by itself (because it was available in black and white, and I had heard bad things about the color copy - plus, I wanted to see it on DVD as it had originally been aired, in black and white), followed by the complete series, and I had read mixed reviews about the complete series set's packaging.<br />Today, I recieved my copy of the complete series of I DREAM OF JEANNIE: the season-by-season fun facts cards were an added bonus I enjoyed reading, and the packaging was very cute - but it was a NIGHTMARE! I felt as if I were doing an art project for school, something I haven't done in a few years. Fold this here, fold this there - it took about 15 minutes to figure it out, and then I had to get rubber bands to hold the genie bottle's neck part of the packaging together, since the glue had come undone. I ended up throwing away the rest of the packaging (the clear boxes - one for the flash cards, one for the whole set, one for the bottle cap - and the bottle cap itself), and the hunkily-assembled (my dad's word, not mine) complete-series-in-a-bottle is standing on my bookshelf amid my DVDs, looking more like an over-sized nick-nack than a DVD collection.<br />Now I wish I had bought the individual seasons instead. (Pun intended.<br />This just seemed less expensive and less time-consuming, considering how fast these shows are being taken of the air in re-runs.)
B0000266T2|3.0|I saw the video of the Simon & Garfunkel Concert in Central Park. I love the classic songs and the dynamic live sound. So I ordered the CD thinking it would have the same sound quality. I was disappointed. The sound is very compressed, which could be a reflection of the technology used to record the live concert back in 1981. However, I also bought their [[ASIN:B000069JIN Live From New York City, 1967]] CD, and that recording sounds very good (maybe because it was recorded in Carnegie Hall). I think the Central Park live concert needs to be remastered for a fuller sound. If you love Simon & Garfunkel music, then you might not mind the sound quality. It is a great live concert.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Not great writing.  To be expected, I suppose.  Sad. I would have purchased this book no matter what.  I would definitely purchase the sequel in 20 years.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book is very slow and so tedious to get involved with.<br />I do not like or think I will get past the first 100 pages.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|not a new cd, there was scribbling  on the covers of all the cd' s  we were very unhappy  because we thought we getting new cd's
B007FEZQF8|5.0|After reading the first volume i was immediately hooked! i had to keep reading because i just had to know what would happen next. im on the tenth volume so far and i just get so lost in this world that is the walking dead. I love it!!! a must read
0439023521|5.0|My middle and oldest kids zipped through all three of these books and the middle kid isn't that avid a reader. So of course I read them too. The scenario was interesting and unique. The way it was written made it seem like a possibility. Some of the characters I rooted for and some I didn't, some kept me guessing for a while which side of the line they would fall on.<br /><br />Some of the killing scenes in this first book seemed too brutal and descriptive. That put me off just a little. I guess our kids are used to it and the book was supposed to be about a brutal world and life. It's just that those scenes seemed to be trying really hard to be disturbing.<br /><br />Overall a good series that kept several in our family interested and reading.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book. It is one of the best yet combining forces of Roman and Greek is a great touch to an awesome series. I highly recommend it to you!
0002171856|5.0|This is a must have for anyone that wants to survive. It doesn't matter wether it is a natural disastor or manmade this book will help you get through it. I suggest buying this larger version of the book and also the pocket size for your vehicle or bugout bag.
0385721234|5.0|The book was as described... Nice content and not hard to understand for non-native Spanish speakers. I'd recommend it. Excellent product.
B008VBYN80|4.0|like the game. looks like a huge money sucked though. I look forward to increasing in levels and meeting other players.
0525953728|5.0|I've been using Amazon since 1995 and this is my first book review. I've read five Seal book lately and this one is by far the most riveting and entertaining. As others have stated I disagree with the politics surrounding this book but must say the Author does a outstanding job retelling the story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My Daughter plays it and downloaded it for me and now I am hooked on it.  Several times a day I'm playing \\"COIN DOZER\\".
B0084I9QIW|4.0|It is Michael Jackson in concert nothing more to say, he is awesome. I have said it before, Michael Jackson was so HOT during the \\"Bad\\" era. Regardless, there was always something sexy about him. Having seen many of his later concerts, he certainly improved on his production as time went on. Not as many theatrics as later concerts just Michael, dancers, musicains, and background singers, tearing it up. I love it.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Yeah, best thing I think I have ever purchased. For the past week I haven't listened to any other artist. There's really nothing more I can say. That's how great this cd is.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great book - enjoyed all three volumes. I hated to have it end. It got so that I felt that I knew Christian and Ana real well. I hope there will be more!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I can't believe this game is free. There's so much content, tons of replay value, smooth animations, and it's so colorful and bright. You lose absolutely nothing downloading this game.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Loved it!  Clean cut crystal clear HD picture and the action was wonderful.  Jam packed with thrills spills and puns.  The humor was small but dry enough that I continued to be amused.  Wonderful job Marvel Studios with yet another GREAT movie.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|thought it was very good movie D. lewis is very good actor. liked him very well in band of brothers. Doesn't seem to do as well on tv shows.But in homeland he does very good. Can't wait for season # 2.
0547564651|5.0|So will anyone else interested in the future of our educational system and our children.<br /><br />So many programs have come and gone since this concept first burst on the scene years ago that I'd almost forgotten it.  But I hadn't missed the implications.  Right up to the day of my retirement from teaching, I felt that the current test-heavy system was doing our students a terrible disservice.  I couldn't put my finger on what I'd learned in the hazy past (pre-Goals 200, pre-NCLB) that would give the lie to the standard we were being forced to use.  Now I've got it in my hand in this well-organized and well-written book.<br /><br />Paul Tough is an acclaimed author for good reason:  He writes in clear language and with an engaging style.  This book is as accessible as anything about educational theory can possibly be.  The research that proved the \\"Baby Einstein\\" program a near-pointless waste of parental time and toddler brain power is discussed in terms that we can all understand.  And there's much, much more!  Want to know what the upshot of the GED program has been?  I had no clue, even after 25 years in the classroom.<br /><br />This book deserves a place in the homes of young parents across the country, as well as in school libraries and (one can only hope) in the hands of the Powers That Be that make the decisions about our educational programs without setting foot in a school or watching a child learn.  Kudos to Mr. Tough for an outstanding effort!  A+
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really enjoy jigsaw puzzles.  And to have one on my Kindle is great because the cat can't mess up the pieces. I do wish though that it would no require me to get on line as I live in the middle of no where and internet service is pretty spotty. I would lke to be able to ouse it where ever I go.  But the puzzles are fun and challenging in the small piece size.
0440246024|3.0|Don't know why I waited so long to read this book.  It is a very different story from Grisham.  The pace is slower, maybe a bit too slow here and there.  But for the most part, a good read.  It was interesting watching Willie, as a 23 year old, becoming an owner/publisher, and then seeing how he matured over the years.  It was also interesting having a story set in the 1970's during Vietnam, and set in the South, with such a huge gap between whites and blacks, but changing for the better as the story progressed.  The pacing may be too slow for some readers, but for me, it was a good story.

0739383280|4.0|Poppy Wyatt loses her engagement ring and I've Got Your Number starts off with a flourish.  While trying to find her engagement ring she makes an unlikely friend, and discovers much about herself and her friends.  True to form, Ms. Kinsella sucks you in by unveiling surprise after surprise; all the while, the reader because attached to the lovely quirky characters.  It isn't possible to give much of a description without giving away too many surprises.  If you like Sophie Kinsella, you'll like this one.  If you've never read Sophie Kinsella, start with a different one and come back to this one.<br /><br />On the story...<br />This book was almost a miss for me.  I just could not believe that anyone in their right mind would grab a cell phone out of the trash.  Not only is it unbelievable that she would use it, but it is unbelievable that anyone would start giving out the number as if it is was their phone.  So at this point in the book (probably page 5 or so) I had a serious attitude and couldn't really take Poppy seriously.  Luckily as the story goes on, I get sucked into the story and I get over the cell phone issue.  I actually ended up enjoying Poppy's character because her \\"personal issue\\" was a unique one and I loved to see her grow as she battled with it.  It's somethingI think many people struggle with.  I'm not going to reveal it even though it isn't much of a secret because the moment when it comes up is pretty funny and it truly made me understand Poppy more as I hadn't thought about it before.  Even though I grew attached to Poppy, she often bugged me with the seriously stupid things that she did.  These were not quirky and funny.  It was just stupid.<br /><br />But all of this would suggest that I didn't enjoy this book and I truly did.  It just took awhile.  Everything that happens earlier in the book is put into perspective and I loved every moment of that.  Plus, best of all... the ROMANCE in this was so sweet.  There isn't a lot actually and I can'ttell you anything about it, but everything about it made me want to melt.  It was so sweet but it wasn't sappy.  Every word spoken just really reeled me in.  It alone would make this a book worth reading.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br /> Unfortunately, I would suggest reading this and not listening.  Ms. Entwistle's voice for Poppy was so whiny.  The voice in combination with the silly/stupid things Poppy sometimes did had me gritting my teeth at times.<br /><br />Overall...<br />This is a book worth reading (not listening) for the second half of the book alone.  It is so worth it.  You just have to get to it.<br /><br />P.S.  There are footnotes.  This is annoying.  Authors should not do this.  More about this phenomenon later.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|They should have named this album \\"GARBAGE.\\" Self indulgent piece of crap. Paul can't sing any more, they're trying to turn Eric and Tommy into Peter and Ace, Simmons is just mailing it in. It's just another attempt to grab a little more money before the inevitable. Look! Get the other guys back, tour for a couple more years and then wait until the hall of fame finally calls you and call it a day. Stop embarrassing yourself with this crap.

B00846REIS|4.0|The book has great characters and the type of boldness that would take me by surprise if I were Eva. Gideon radiates control and is super hot! Eva seems a little on the shy side but of course there is reason behind it. They are captivated by each other right from the beginning and it shows! The broken are always seeking comfort and acceptance in others that understand... I just hope Gideon opens up about why he is broken! I cannot wait to continue this series and see where the the road takes Gideon and Eva! This book is similar on some levels to Fifty Shades, but completely different all in one! If you loved Fifty Shades, then you will love this too! Maybe even more!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book had me on the very edge of my seat the whole day and a half it took me to read it! I could not put it down! the twists and turns and ups and downs are fantastic and keep you as addicted to the series as Eva and Gideon are to each other! Sylvia has shown a little more in depth how broken these two really are. But what you can't miss, outside of the great sex and protectiveness, is the love that radiates out of each of their souls. I cannot express the excitement and hurt and madness I felt through out this book. It reels you in and steals your mind and thoughts even after you've finished reading it. I am hoping and praying that Sylvia makes this longer than a three book series because I honestly don't think it will be enough. This story has my stomach in knots and my palms clammy, and my box of tissues empty. I am stolen by this book. New year's eve cannot come soon enough. And please lets hope this is NOT the last of this rocky, addictive relationship!

Like earlier CG offerings, the tech is good and the action is jam packed.  You're not going to have your life transformed by this movie but you WILL enjoy yourself for the duration...if horrific mutation and the questionably undead are your idea of enjoyment!  And really, what's not to enjoy?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect and heard so many different things that I wanted to read the book. I was really surprised, it was really good. Yes, there is a lot of sex but there is also a story. As soon as I finished it, I couldn't wait to order the 2nd book to see how the story turns out.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|There are a lot of fun options and its super easy to use I love it if you want a quick edit this is it
B006VA57CY|5.0|GREAT SHOW..GREAT SHOW...GREAT SHOW....I started watching this by mistake, and that all it took for me to DVR each Sunday's on WETA in Washington DC. Can not get enough.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is perfect for the new Kindle Fire 7, and much less expensive then other option. There's no fancy bells or whistles, but what more do you need? I like the non-skid material on the inside that helps keep the device propped up for movie watching and whatnot. Great case!

B004QX07G4|2.0|Ellen is funny, I give her that. This book was a whole lot of jibberish, a bunch of nonsense. the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because i laughed at some of the jibberish. I was pretty disappointed, i love Ellen and actually thought i was going to learn more about her through reading her book. the only thing i learned was that she should stick to stand up comedy and talk show hosting and leave book writing to people that have something to write about.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|If you're a fan of Abba and Meryl Streep, then this is the movie for you. All around fun movie.

B007STBUIW|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies - They did a great job remastering this movie for the blue ray release, and the bonus features are great - I learned many new things about the movie I didn't know previously. This is a movie everyone should have in their personal library.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|A great movie with outstanding drama and fantastic music. I'll watch it over and over again. Operas don't get better than this.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|challenging and fun!!! I used to be addicted to rise of Atlantis so it was awesome to get this download!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I love this movie is very funny and has alot of songs. My little girls love this movie is a heart warming tale of a princess who was told to never give up and to work hard for her dreams. The prince in the other hand was always given everything, But soon finds him self with nothing and in New Orleans. Great buy.
B002BWP49C|3.0|This video was in perfect condition when I received it. After several uses though the special features disk stopped working.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Could have been an excellent movie but I found myself recalling identical scenes from Neverending Story, LOTR, and Willow. Very disappointed in what could have been an excellent film.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a page-turner! Not for the faint of heart, but definitely very entertaining. It's the perfect book for a long honeymoon flight :)
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Great Music at a Great Value. You can't go wrong with a purchase of this collection. Delightful music at a bargain price.
B008J34466|5.0|Got all u pink lover's out there, It's a must buy . One off her best yet. Good kick off before starting her tour next year .  Will be in Boston March 28
0143119680|5.0|This book was very engaging and entertaining. I was hesitant to start a \\"vampire/witch\\" story because I was not a Twilight fan (I know, I'm probably the only one). But the characters in this book are adults, so are much more relatable. It's a fantasy world that pulls you right in and you don't want to leave. I can't wait to see how the trilogy ends!
0739375970|4.0|I'm currantly listening to the CD's.  I do this while driving to work and back.  Only time I have any more for reading.  Very good so far.  Love the Dragons and the Dire Wolves.  Outstanding Characters, almost afraid to get attached.  Everytime I've done so in this series, they get killed. But I keep coming back for more.
0307960471|5.0|Harry is a character I've become rather attached to over the years, but I've also become used to things not going so well for him over the course of the series. Phantom is the ninth installment of this series and the seventh to be translated into English; if you've been a faithful follower of Nesbø's novels, you definitely do not want to miss this one. If you are just beginning with Nesbø, do not, I repeat, do not make this your first experience.<br /><br />A few years have passed since Harry Hole was last in Oslo; when we last saw him he was on his way back to Hong Kong, where he retreated to clean himself up and deal with the demons plaguing his life, having to do mainly with his relationship with Rakel. Now he's back and it's personal: Rakel's son Oleg is in prison, after being incarcerated for killing a heroin addict named Gusto. Everything points to Oleg as the shooter; Harry doesn't believe it and returns to clear his name. Having been officially warned to stay away from this particular case by his former colleagues, Harry being Harry is not content to sit idly by and finds himself in the middle of his own private investigation that leads him into the murky depths of drug addiction and production, gang wars, corruption and a reclusive but powerful Russian known as Dubai. Dubai, \\"a kind of phantom ... like the wind, impossible to catch,\\" has worked to corner the market on a new drug called Violin, which offers its users a prolonged euphoria, making it the newest high of choice among heroin users, a \\"junkie's dream,\\" \\"stronger than heroin, longer effect, and little chance of OD'ing.\\"<br /><br />The story is related through different viewpoints, one of which is from a dying Gusto. It is here where the reader discovers how Oleg becomes involved in events that will ultimately lead him to prison. Normally I dislike the \\"voice from the grave\\" approach, or actually in this case the \\"as I lay dying\\" device, but here it is engaged to provide necessary backstory and it works as a focal point for bringing together the various storylines as they are played out individually throughout the novel -- at least, up to a point.<br /><br />Phantom is an intensely bleak read -- from the sadness of the addicts on the streets doing whatever is necessary to score to the final moments of the novel, the atmosphere Nesbø creates is one of sheer darkness, alleviated here and there with some humorous moments, including a neck wound held together by duct tape, or the running gags about his one and only suit. And Harry's back with his trademark angst, this time ruminating over his shortcomings with Oleg who looked on him as a dad in years past, and the \\"curse\\" he's carried with him in which he realizes that all of those he loves eventually suffer at his hands.<br /><br />At the same time, it's a very compelling read; so much so that it's easy to overlook a few other standard Nesbø trademarks, including the sometimes over-the-top verbosity, sometimes clunky dialogue, scenes that could have been easily shortened with no damage to the overall story, and related plot lines that capture your interest then sort of fade out. The second half of the book is where the action really picks up and where the story becomes its most intense, with many twists and turns that I never saw coming, and writing that maintains a tightly-strung tension, literally up until the very last moment.<br /><br />Die-hard Harry Hole fans should consider a kleenex as a necessary accompaniment to this novel, and you'll seriously feel the need to put the book down, get up, go outside and find some sunlight as you get into the story. I'm happy to see that the Stieg Larsson comparison is gone from the cover (yay!); Nesbø has no need of putting his work up against that of anyone else -- his standing in crime fiction, Scandinavian or otherwise, needs no bolstering by setting his work against that of others. Do not miss this book if you are continuing the series, and as I noted above, youshould absolutely NOT start the series with this story. To the book's naysayers I can only answer with the following: this is not great literature, but it's a hell of a ride. (less)should absolutely NOT start the series with this story. To the book's naysayers I can only answer with the following: this is not great literature, but it's a hell of a ride. (less)
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed this series more than the Fifty Shades series.  I can't wait for the third book to be released.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|Taken from the famed comic strip by Hal Foster ,  Prince Valiant is a fun movie true to the spirit of the strip. It stars a very young Robert Wagner as Val & Sterling Hayden as Sir Gwain and Janet Leigh as as Aleta. Fun for fans of the strip and others as well.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Loved this show - nice mix of Frights and Dark Humor.  Great character development and a clean easy to follow story line.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|clean graphics, no stalling. good match game with interesting premise. good adaptation for the android os. great for the whole family.
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a really good app because it's really easy and hard and I like how that is this is the best app every I will tell all my friends about it because its soooooooooooooooooooo good
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Actually a lot of fun. Frustrating to plan a move and lose it to an unexpected cascade. The occasional highly beneficial cascade makes up for it.
1451648537|5.0|I purchased this shortly after it came out on Amazon. I can't say that I regretted it, It was an excellent book written by an excellent author.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I'm sorry but words cannot describe any of Rick Riordans books, but I'll do my best.<br />  The last Olympian was an amazing book, the plot line, the characters, and just the right amount of drama has led to the amazing outcome of this book and I really hope Mr.Riordan continues to write and that his skill passes on to his son Haley.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I am an avid GoPro user and I was looking to record audio as the camera was mounted on the inside of a car. I was skeptical about not using a microphone, but the skeleton case worked just fine. The camera records decent audio. In good enough quality that  you can work with it. Another big advantage is being able to plug into the charging port while filming so you have a recording time only limited to the size of your SD card. The Skeleton Housing full access to the SD card slot, USB port, microphone and video out ports. This being said this case is not waterproof. A good buy for anyone looking to record audio with their GoPro.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I am 2/3 completed with this book but find it very, very well written and has me wishing for more spare time to allow me to finish it!  Lisbeth is a very complex person with amazing talents and vision.  Mr. Larsson weaves this tale with intrigue, passion, and terrific word pictures of the characters.
1423140591|5.0|OMG! This book is simply amazing! Riordan has completed the near impossible task of creating a sequel that not only improves upon the first book, but is better than it. One of the things that make \\"The Son of Neptune\\" so spectacular is that this book is completely different than all of Rick's other 'Greek gods books' while still having the same underlying...'rhythm' so to say.<br /><br />  \\"The Son of Neptune\\" focuses on the Roman version of Camp Half Blood, Camp Jupiter. This book follows suit to \\"The Lost Hero\\" in that not one, but three demigods tell the story. There is Percy Jackson, an amnesiac Neptune(or Poseidon, whatever you prefer) whose only lingering memory is Annabeth (hmmm...wonder who THAT is), Hazel, a guilt-ridden daughter of Pluto who died [for the first time] just around 70 years ago, and Frank, a Chinese-Canadian whose father has yet to claim him, even though it is just after his 16th birthday. Frank's life is dependent upon a half-burned piece of wood.<br /><br />  This book is truly unlike any of Riordan's past work, the characters and situations are new and exciting, and even the old friends that we do revisit we get to learn more about. So for a good read that entertain and educates you(without you realizing it) at the same time read \\"The Son of Neptune\\" by Rick Riordan... 5 STARS!!!! For this and more reviews go to [...]
B007THA4FI|5.0|Barry Fairbrother's death is the catalyst that changes the lives of numerous people in the small village of Pagford.  JK Rowling has intricately woven together seemingly unrelated characters in her first \\"adult\\" novel.  She tells with heartbreaking honesty about the lives of both adults and teenagers in a small English town (that could just as easily be in America).  At the heart of the tangle of lives is Krystal and Robbie Weedon and Barry Fairbrother's death was the beginning of the end for them too.  Husbands and wives, fathers and sons, all of their secrets are revealed and you just might recognize yourself in one of these oh-so-human characters.  There is no magic to make their lives more bearable (but magic never did that at Hogwarts either) and people learn that they must live with the consequences of their actions, or lack of action in some cases.<br /><br />This is a book full of people that will stick with you long after you have finished reading.  If you expect wands and happily ever after, pick a different book.  If you want something a little more introspective than the usual chic lit, then this is for you. You won't regret it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great game to pass the time.  It makes you work your mind.  Lots of fun.  It becomes addictive.  You can\\"t put it down.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Gillian Flynn has been one of my favorite authors lately. After reading Gone Girl and Sharp Objects, I decided to give another one of her books a go.<br /><br />Dark Places is about Libby Day whose mother and two sisters are brutally murdered when she is seven years old. The narration flips between present-day Libby and her mother and brother the day of the murders.<br /><br />Dark Places is, well, dark. I'm usually a fan of the dark and twisty, but this was a little bit too much for me. Maybe I just haven't been in the right state of mind for dark this week, but this book seemed especially gruesome. Otherwise, it was a great story. The characters are well-developed and it is engaging right up to the last chapter. There is, of course, several twists along the way that keep you on your toes. Bottom line: check it out if you are looking for a good thriller and like really dark and twisty.
1609611543|5.0|I got this book, read it and thought I would experiment just to see what happened.  It's been three weeks now of gluten-free.  The biggest change I've noticed is that I don't have any cravings.  I only eat now because it's lunch time or it's dinner time.  I used to watch TV at night and think about what was in the kitchen that I could eat.  Not any more.  I'm not religious about it or anything.  The other day my husband made cheeseburgers with \\"regular\\" buns and I ate that.  I just try to eat gluten-free.  It's becoming a little easier now to shop for gluten-free products.  I buy gluten-free bread which is really good, gluten-free pasta that is the same color as regular pasta and tastes just as good (it evens cooks to a perfect \\"al dente\\").  I feel that my brain fog has lifted slightly too.  I can recall things quicker.  I'm pretty happy with the results so I'm going to continue to make this change in my eating habits.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House is about a Lavinia, an Irish orphan, who is sold to the owner of a tobacco plantation and becomes an indentured servant at the age of 7. She arrives with no memory of her past and quickly adopts the other servants as her family. The story is told by two narrators, Lavinia and Belle, a member of her adopted family. As you can imagine, tension arises between the two characters due to their difference in skin color and therefore social status.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and its unique narrative style. It was engaging and the characters were well-developed. At times it was a page-turner, but I didn't feel that way throughout. The historical information is interesting and adds a lot of depth to the plot and characters.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|its fun but it gets birding if u keep playing and its 400 just tor another person so its Mindanao sucks
B000QCS8TW|4.0|A Game of Thrones is story of medieval royalty and the struggle for power in a world where the seasons last for years. A consistent theme of impending doom shows up often with characters uttering the phrase \\"winter is coming.\\" There are a ton of characters and several different story lines that are woven together throughout the book, so I won't try to detail it any further.<br /><br />A note of warning: the first 50-100 pages of this book are tough to get through. As I said, there are a ton of characters and places with unusual names. Don't get caught up in memorizing every person and place, because I promise it will weave itself together and become easier as you get further along. It's also a story that is told somewhat in retrospect, so if you feel lost in the first few chapters, you will catch up when you get the full story in another chapter.
0525953728|5.0|The book was very interesting and easy to read. It started with the training and skills required to a successful completion of the required assignment.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Mahjong is fun even though I haven't been very successful at solving the puzzles! I keep trying.....maybe some day I will actually figure out the mystery .
B00866H7SS|1.0|I was not impressed. It was almost an exact copy of 50Shades of grey. Same story line, and then even the same damn dom/sub stuff. Come on don't just copy other story lines.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing! so sad to see it end though! read all three hunger games books! you'll be pleased!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|fun game to play on kindle it gets difficult in the later levels but its alright if you can make it to the top level good story line to follow
B0028MBKVG|5.0|the book was informative and inspiring, well writen and thrilling at moments, def a joy to read and a must read for anyone into jogging and long distance running
B00992CF6W|3.0|no npc towns no wolfs  no slimes i can name alot of &quot;no's&quot; but this is still great. also the game should be just like the pc version and xbox version not AN END TO THE GAME!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|In every interview about the film - it was never intended to be as frightening as Alien. The 3D is amazing and I recommend getting it for your 3D home system. It does feel a bit like a prolog to something rather then actually being something - but compared to most films out there - it's extremely well done. Compare this to other A list sci-fi films of the year like John Carter (which I sort of liked in 3D) or Men in Black 3 (Which is also a decent film) this one is much - much better.
B0086700CM|5.0|I LIKE THIS GAME SO MUCH I JUST LOWER THE SOUNDS OF THE GAME AND LISTEN TO MY MUSIC WHILE PLAYIN ITS GREAT!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have this on my laptop and was excited to see that there is an Android version. Works great on my Toshiba Thrive.
030758836X|1.0|Simply put - if I hadn't gotten this for free, I would've been really upset. Awful, just horrible and insane!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|First read DeMille in The Generals Daughter and have been hooked ever since.  This is classic DeMille and will not disappoint.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Anthony has definitely had an interesting life.  I found myself laughing at some of the stories and becoming annoyed with his inability to keep his life on track at times.  All-in-all an entertaining read.
1594135851|5.0|I have read all three book and \\"Catching Fire\\"was the best one in the trilogy. All three were great and I am looking forward to reading them all again, however, the 2nd book, Catching Fire was the best one in my opinion. Exciting, full of twists and turns. Great book
B005LAIHY0|4.0|But settled for only good.  I watched the movie and thought it was an OK movie.  I watched the deleted scenes and thought that they explained a lot.  If they hadn't made the cuts that they did, it would've been a great movie.  I was a little confused when I first saw prometheous but the deleted scenes explained them all.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple run now has some glitches from the last update. The game sometimes stalls, which gets really annoying. Otherwise it is great.
0393072231|3.0|While certainly entertaining, the book overlooks the huge risks that were imbedded in the startegy to short the mortgage market.  Yes, they were right but the risks were huge and the casual reader might not fully understand this.  The risks are not well explained but...  great entertaining reading.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|I was a big fan of Rebecca ever since I watched her on the x factor<br />She deserved to win and her voice is unique
B003YL4KS0|5.0|These instructions really work!  For those of us with curly hair who thought it was damaged beyond repair, by following these instructions, you can bring the curls back and enjoy them again.  And you will be able to relate to the stories from curly girls - I know I did!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I am having fun... wasting time. good game. gets a little more difficult each level. but good fun. how many words do I need to get out of this review??
034580404X|1.0|Sorry, it was boring, I even skipped the sex scences to find out what the very obvious plot was. Apparently I have too good a sex life.  Quite a few friends raved about it and were quite excited by the sex.  Clearly they aren't getting enough.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|These bulbs are much brighter than the same wattage of flourescent or regular bulbs, so you have to take that into consideration when you buy these.The lights are a beautiful soft white. Not too bright to hurt your eyes, but excellent for reading. Best of all, they don't cause headaches like those other bulbs. I recommend these bulbs big time. I am so glad I bought them. I only wish they made tube and circuline versions, so I can replace those mercury-laden flourescent lights I now have in my kitchen.
B000TERLEK|4.0|Don't let the review title get you cooled off; this is a fantastic album! It has a lot of similar feeling songs within it, so as long as you like the style of one song you should like the whole album! I love the unique melodies and atonal chords in this album, the lyrical content is a strong B, but all in all I'd say it was definitely worth the money!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|They must make another, Marvel fans have waited a long time for this, I wasn't much of a Downey fan till IRONMAN and he pulls it off perfectly, can not wait to see what The Avengers come up against next.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Call of Atlantis is the best game that I had ever played on the K-Fire. All the other games that I have played had so many issues. &amp; most of those games weren't a &quot;keeper&quot; besides this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft.But it needs more upgrades like water in the creative mode and animals in the creative mode. and maybe some more blocks of different kinds the water in creative mode would be very helpful.
1416987118|5.0|It is a classic.  Reading it to my grandchildren is a real fun<br />experience.  Then when they can start saying the words before you do,<br />you know how much they get into the book.  Whoosh, whoosh, plop, plop.<br />I feel sorry for the lonely bear at the end.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I used her first video in high school and got in such good shape. Now after having my son I moved on to this dvd and it's definetely working! I can see the toning in my sides, stomache, and arms especially. It gives you energy and Cindy is a great girl to workout with.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great worth the 7 dollars! Diamonds gold and iron everywhere and there's even redefine just can't mine or use it yet. But it needs buckets minecarts mushroom farming but that will be up to the next pe update!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's a real page turner with a bit of an unexpected, if not fairy-tale ending. I look forward to more from E.L. James.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Not being a great unforgettable movie, this one is worth the viewing. Better told and performed than most late years' typical American hits. The British way in comedies is more sophisticated than usual, but still easy for all audiences. This particular one lacks the \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" thrill, and keeps close in mildness to \\"Salmon fishing in the Yemen\\", just to mention two other recent British comedies.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I probably would not have bought this game because I'm pretty frugal.  Luckily,  it was a free app of the day.  I absolutely love this game.  The graphics are very nice, the music and narration is pleasant.  It is a variation on the bejewelled concept with some interesting capabilities that can be earned.  It is not a seriously challenging game, so far, but that could change.  But I find it addicting.
B008N2Z1M4|5.0|Glad all over captures the human spirit.Hands down.....By that i mean- feel good beats and feel good rhythym. Every song in my opinion is flawless.This album from \\"Misfits And Lovers\\" To \\" Have mercy on him now\\" is amazing. \\"Love is a country\\" another amazing song..I tell you one thing-- and honestly, Im glad i bought this album.It was an unexpected treasure that made me feel good.Thats rare.The songwriting is on-freakin point and the structures of each song can please the old skool punk crowds..A throwback with a \\"clash\\" blessing makes this album my pick of the year and it's  only October...It brought my spirits and faith up in Rock music...Refreshed and ready for the forefront.Thank you for reading and \\"Thank goodness\\" For \\"The Wallflowers\\" Get this album..-honest review from gary/texas
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It is pretty fun. The best free game that they have had in quite a while. It should be a good little time waster.
1611761565|5.0|Just a great story to a sad part of our history. I really enjoyed the story and felt it gave a very fair evaluation of the mission. I was sad when the story ended.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is the best free game that I have played that was designated as the free app of the day.
B00631VJIC|5.0|We enjoy this CD very much.  It has a wide variety of music that is easy to listen to.  I would recommend it to anyone even if you are not a Sons of Anarchy fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am so glad that Minecraft Pocket Edition finally came out for Kindle Fire. It looks great, it works great, and it is worth every penny I paid for it. The multiplayer works great, with every other device that has Pocket Edition. I've tried it with most apple products, and ome android phones and a few android tablets. You just have to be on the same wi-fi network. I think it should have bluetooth connectivity, but I guess that might eventually come in an update. It's grat to have a Minecraft in your pocket. Really, I think the coolest thing about the app is, you can copy and save maps while in multiplayer. One more issue, amazon really should try to keep even kind of close to apple with the updates. It takes forever. But great app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am really enjoying this trilogy so far from Hunger Games through book two (Catching Fire), and am very much looking forward to book three (Mockingjay)
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is a great album with great songs, many of which you don't hear on the radio...or at least not yet. I think 'Demons' is my favorite track yet. You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Screw Christmas! I can't wait for December 31st when book # 3 is released! Just like in Bared to You, Sylvia Day manages to capture all the eroticism and anguishing love found in 50 Shades, but it's actually written well, too! I absolutely cannot wait to see where Gideon and Eva wind up now that his secret has finally been revealed!
B008XG1X18|4.0|but the app is very slow....of it ran faster I would of given 5 stars! still very addicting. still love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a fun game and I like being able to just tap on a card to move it.  Ads are annoying but a necessary evil I guess.... and easy to get out of.

0316743003|5.0|I loved this book and its story of unmatched innovation and speed to production. This group changed the balance of power during the Cold War, IMHO.<br /><br />Says Tom Peters, about the origin of Skunk Works, 1943:  \\"Clarence (Kelly) Johnson, 43 years at Lockheed, earned a reputation for innovation, quality, and acting as a bunch of mavericks. He invented more with less--and faster--than anyone we know.\\" Says Peters, \\"Honor Your Skunks\\"<br /><br />Skunk Works most famous:  U-2, the SR-71 Blackbird spy planes, and the stealth F-117A fighter used in the first Iraqi war to deliver smart bombs undetected.<br /><br />Should be required reading for any manager concerned about innovation and team work written by true practitioners.<br /><br />Three memorable quotes I copied from this 1995 book:<br /><br />1. \\"That damned Swede (Kelly Johnson) can actually see air.\\" Hal Hibbard, Kelly's first boss, making a compliment Kelly always remembered.<br /><br />2. Kelly's `riot act' consisted of the basic rules we worked by, e.g., \\"engineers shall always work within a stone's throw of the airplane being built; and any cause for delay shall be immediately reported to C. I. Johnson in writing by the person anticipating the delay; and everything possible will be done to save time. For as long as you work here, this is your gospel.\\"<br /><br />3. \\"Leaders are natural born; managers must be trained. When Noah designed an ark and gathered his family and a pair of male and female animals of all species to avoid the Great Flood, he demonstrated his leadership. But when he turned to his wife and said, `Make certain that the elephants don't see what the rabbits are doing,' he was being a farsighted, practical manager. There's a real shortage of effective managers in government and industry today.\\"

B002NJWHHA|1.0|This review is not for the Actual movie. It desires 4-5 stars. The one star is for the extended version of the movie... It is ONE WHOLE MINUTE than the standard version. That is not an extended version.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it reminds me of some games but I like how it has the mini games in it. like I said best game ever made for the kindle fire

B004MC8CA2|5.0|No complaints..many available versions and a great app to have! I like the ease of use and of course the convenience!
B00913DPW2|4.0|It's not exactly a negative, but I found this game to be a lot more difficult than others in the genre. This was partly due to bugginess and partly due to the developer just making a harder game that doesn't hold your hand or have overly obvious solutions.<br /><br />I admit I tried to use hints a couple of times and found them to be pretty useless, mostly just telling me what I already knew, or being so vague as to be more frustrating than helpful.<br /><br />There's a really annoying tile puzzle section that I got stuck on for a while until I realized there was an option to skip buried in the settings menu. Thank god for that or I probably would not have had the patience to complete the game.<br /><br />Finally, either the game has the most anticlimactic ending ever, or it glitched out when I solved the final puzzle. There was no cutscene or anything to wrap things up. It just sat there and I was stuck on that screen. Kind of a disappointing way to finish an otherwise enjoyable game. I don't feel inclined to play through the whole thing again just to find out.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've owned this headset for like one year, and it is still working like the first day.<br />Just something I want to share, when I had like 3 months owning this product I lost my USB Adapter on a friend house, I panicked... So I proceed to write an eMail to Logitech asking them for directions to buy a new one, it was my fault after all, and they answered me after one day telling me that they would send me a new one for free... that was very kind of their part :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game great grafics . like this game for a fun time when you r<br />are waiting in line.<br />great little chalange
B005VPRET4|5.0|When our grandaughter opened this present, she exclaimed to her mother, \\"Oh, this is what I always wanted!\\"  It doesn't get much plainer than that.  Thanks!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|The game is very fun but it is quite short for the price. However, I got on the app of the day and it was awesome as a free app!
B005HSL626|5.0|if you turn your wi ti off you wont get any pop up ads its a fun game though. I recommend downloading it and free. you cant beat it. enjoy
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got this game for free but I would buy it even if it wasn't .From what I see its a good price
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I was thinking of something to watch and I decided to give this one a look.  I'm really glad I did.  I thought that Tommy Lee Jones played a perfect part in this movie.  I have read that this is based on a novel.  I honestly didn't know that and I still liked it and it kept me interested all the way through. I have always enjoyed movies and novels based on small town secrets with myself living in a small tight knit community  I understand how that is. Like they say, \\"Everyone knows your name and secrets\\".
B0053TMP24|5.0|This series is so exciting and informative. If you have any interest in the Greek and Roman gods this book is for you. If you don't, it's still a great read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|omg I love puzzle games I got it when it was free and Ps that was a great deal I totally think you should get this game despite it is 5 dollars
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I can't believe i didn't give AMD a chance before now, Ultimate performance with great value also the cooling fan looks better than Intel cheap crap, i don't know about how runs cooler but this product blow my mind i didn't expect it to be this good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|FINALLY!!!!!!  My waiting is over!! I can now play MCPE and not stupid block story. I mean who wants that crap. I know its kinds cool but I don't like it at all!!
B0091REZMW|2.0|I'm sure it's a good hidden object game and I wanted to like it but I would have liked more options for play format such as a casual mode (no timer; no limit to &quot;energy&quot;; no night search--just search for a list of items in each room).  The only settings option I found was to turn the sound and music off or on.  I also found it to be a little complicated and confusing ... items to search for sometimes by word, sometimes by silhouette; a separate list of items to collect (not sure how I collected those I did).  Will be uninstalling.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|For a FAOTD this is a definite download. The story isn't the most in depth but as far as match three games go it suffices, especially when its free. The only thing so far that could be better is the elevator like music but that is nitpicking. For fans of this genre its a no-brainer. Kudos to the designers.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|fun game not too fast paced. similar to bejeweled but more interesting. great way to pass the time. like it.
145162607X|4.0|A thoroughly impressive presentation of the facts at the time and an accurate presentation of the women's point of view of the events.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|No.  Please not UltraViolet.  Why not provide a digital copy in a useful format like iTunes rather than the dysfunctional, non-portable, and ultimately worthless UltraViolet?

034580404X|5.0|These books are the sexiest books ever! I love curling up with a good book... But throughout the day I would find myself daydreaming and wondering what was gonna happen  next!! So steamy,  Sexy and erotic!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was even better than the first one.  I read the first one again to refresh my memory but was pleasantly surprised to find the second one was less like 50 Shades but maintaining the integrity of the story.  I couldn't put this book down and I am currently reading it again.  Gideon Cross is definately no Christian Gray but you find yourself pulled to him all the same.  I can't wait for December 31st to read the next one!
B007HO392S|1.0|I love Carrie Underwood and have bought all of her c.d.'s. I was excited that she had another new c.d. but when I listened to it, I was horrified. The first song \\"Good Girl\\" is pretty nice but the rest is just so depressing. A song about two women who kill a guy and a guy that commits so many sins that his daughter wants the house to blow away?!?? Really - I hated it. I'm throwing the c.d. away because I don't want anyone else to listen to this garbage!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app!!! it wakes me up every morning. Its great period!! get it! I love it so much!!!! it makes it easier to wake up:) I am in LOVE with it!!!! like I said it just a great,wonderful, and perfect app!
B004R13U6Y|1.0|This software was reccommended to be able to read books in epub format on my Kindle.  It was difficult to download, requiring that I load it onto my computer as well as my Kindle. All it did for my computer is give me a tool bar I do not want.  My Kindle and my computer still cannot open epub books.  Lots of time and a little money waisted.
1118109791|5.0|The book is bigger than I thought, an it seems to be a good prep material. Comes with a cd exclusive to those who buy it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read Defending Jacob on my Amazon Kindle.  It was a page turner for me.<br />It contains twists and unexpected turns.  It's one I couldn't wait to get to<br />each day.  By the end, I read well past my bedtime.  Hate that it's over.
0062124293|5.0|Entertaining, earnest and informative! Hard to put down and a very swift read. I had a friend waiting to borrow my copy as soon as I finished it.
B005OP7162|5.0|This show is now my favorite drama of all time!!  My friend suggested it, and I'm so glad she did!  The drama keeps you guessing, and wanting more.  The characters work great together, and they throw in some light humor every now and then.  A MUST WATCH if you like drama!
B00275EHJG|5.0|What is there not to like about this gift. The boys loved watch it with there grandfather. Then later with all of us...
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this series. Never watched it on tv when it aired originally. Got hooked on it now since cable has been showing the reruns late at night. Was curious about the characters and how the series started out so I ordered the complete series on dvd. Was surprised to find out the package contained the bonus movies as well!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I started reading the Hunger Games because I watched the movie one night without expecting a lot. I liked the movie, but I always like the books better. Read the first one in about a week (could have done it in 3 days!) and went on to the 2nd book. It was a great continuation and really set the mood for what was going to happen on the final book. Really recommend it!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book...way better than the movie!    I cant wait to read part two !  I would recommend this book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved every aspect of  all three books. the love story was heartwarming as well as sad, all the ups and downs were unexpected and very moving. It is not all about the crazy sex that goes on throughout the book, its about the story as well. Amazing, i would recommend this trilogy to anyone that wants to read an amazing love story with some very interesting sex scenarios!
B004N622EY|5.0|On of the best fantasy novels I have read in a long time. Interesting and innovative magic system and compelling characters, 5 stars from me.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|After refusing to watch the show until sept. I watched the first 3 seasons on Netflix in 2 wks then bought season 4 cause it wasn't on Netflix and it took a day and a half to watch it all. This show got me hooked like the Shield did. Fx is the best network for quality tv these days.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I've been a avid Dexter fan since the first season. The show only gets better and better with each episode/season. I hope they keep them coming.
B008RTE08E|3.0|The image quality on the new DVD is GREAT! Much better than I'd hoped for considering the age and the recordings of it to date. However, make no mistake, this one is for fans ONLY! It took my several attempts before I could even make it through the whole thing without cringing. This is essentially a home movie that the Beatles made the mistake of broadcasting. - The commentary track from Paul is good and there is a nice 'making of' segment, but I think they could have done a little better with the extras since they know the movie itself is not that good. They also hid a few cookies on the main menu, which I think should have been just listed in the extras to make it easier for everyone.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|After getting my first DSLR camera, I didn't realize I needed to keep the rear lens cap! Ever since then I had been 1 short. Why I didn't buy this sooner, I don't know. It fits perfectly and works just like the original. The LF-4 style fits all my lenses and, as far as I know, fits all Nikon lenses. If you need a replacement, don't wait around just grab this one and you wont be sorry.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a retired Field Grade Army Officer, I was worried with the concerns Active Flag Officers voiced the day this book hit the stands.  In my read, I could not find anything that would compromise future missions nor anyone on the mission.  If you know a Seal, you know the type of person described in the book as an accurate depiction of one of this elite group.  If you do not know a seal, you will have a good understanding of the stress on families, the training required, and why the term, \\"Ring the bell\\" is so important to them.  Ringing the bell is required to quit the program and every Master Chief pushes every trainee Seal so hard, many focus on \\"NOT ringing the bell\\" in order to keep going.<br /><br />This account is riveting, written in a style you would expect from an active military veteran [now, post-active duty].  He takes you there-then takes you back to where his journey began, only to return to the story at hand.  This book isn't about UBL, [Bin Laden].  It is about the forces that train every day to keep this country safe.  The forces of the Joint Special Operations Command are the first in and many times, neutralize the situation before any front line boots hit the ground.<br /><br />I know a Seal-in fact many JSOC men.  While I understand their drive and passion, I now know them better.  It is hard for them to talk about their missions.  Most missions have classifications way above my need to know.  This has given me a better understanding of the man in the doorway of the chopper going out in the dark.<br /><br />It took guts to write this book.  Many have disapproved.  I do not.
0525953728|5.0|Absolutely riveting read.  Makes you proud to be an American knowing men like these are working on our side.  Hopefully this election will give these warriors a Commander in Chief that truly appreciates them.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Works great on HTC rezound, kept me challeneged and very entertained. Never had any problems at all. Definitely a good purchase
B00013M6NK|5.0|Not a lot to say about this item, it's a rechargeable battery that fits my Nikon camera. I use it as a back- up when taking a lot of pictures. It was easy to order from Amazon and delivery was quick.
1619691884|4.0|A courageous account to the bitter end. Few people could continue to write so well while facing such an intimidating demise. Brilliant to the end.
B0091THRCU|5.0|This case fits the iPhone 5 nice and snug and protects it all around.  I found it to be the perfect case!
B004ULNJF8|1.0|I bought this movie without watching it first.  I enjoy  and watch most of his films numerous times.  This is Statham's worst film and maybe the worst film I have ever watched.  Low on action.  Smaller plot lines within the movie went nowhere.  Waste of money and time.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|There will not be anything on Sunken Condos that will surprise fans of Steely Dan and Donald Fagen's solo material.  That is a good thing, IMO.  After all, we wouldn't want to hear him doing traditional country or heavy metal, would we?  Fagen and his production partner Michael Leonhart have given us yet another collection of luxuriously arranged, jazzy tunes that highlight Fagen's skill at clever, wry lyrics and cool melodies.  Actually, with that latter item, the tunes on Condos sometimes sound a little too similar to previous Fagen songs, or are a bit too repetitive (ex., \\"Memorabilia\\").  However, those are minor problems when the overall SOUND of the album is so marvelously smooth and sleek.  Plus, the musicianship is superb.  As examples of these strengths, just check out the fine electric guitar solo (by Jon Herington) on \\"Weather in My Head,\\" essentially as good as previous solos by esteemed past Fagen collaborators like Becker, Carlton, et al.  Or try a toe-tappin' bit of jazz-funk goodness such as \\"The New Breed.\\"  It may not be anything radical or new, but it's still great to listen to.
B008RC72G8|1.0|I love Johnny Depp and I do like some Tim Burton movies. Had high expectations but was hugely disappointed. Very boring storyline that didn't make sense and wasn't the least bit funny.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game combines match three and a section where you pair the objects.  I like the variety.  Doesn't take a lot of brain power so I can take advantage of the time to relax.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|It was a fun read<br />Lots of suspense and unanswered questions right to the end<br />Just fun beach reading<br />I would recommend it
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It's a very addictive game to play. Got it as the free app of the day, but I would pay for it after playing. Reminds me of Wizard Blox on ipod touch. Fun!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|\\"First Dive to Visit Fagen's Sunken Condos\\"<br /><br />Jim McPartland<br /><br />I've had trouble doing anything but listen to Donald Fagen's Sunken Condos since it streamed yesterday, 10/9, one week before its official release.<br /><br />I'm on eight times straight through so far.<br /><br />Like fine wine, it gets better with each listen. And like most of Fagen's material, it's very complex with lots of musical intricacies. Sunken Condos is a mixture of jazz, blues, rock, and 70's funk--and Fagen has never been in better form.<br /><br />Sunken Condos is Fagen's strongest solo material EVER.  Better than The Nightfly--and I LOVE Nightfly.<br /><br />It surpasses Steely Dan's Grammy Award winning Two Against Nature. And as good as Walter Becker is at contributing to Steely Dan, Fagen proves he is and always has been Steely Dan's driving force.<br /><br />THIS IS GRAMMY AWARD MATERIAL!!<br /><br />Donald made a great choice having Michael Leonhart co-produce. Michael `gets it' and his horn playing/orchestration are powerful. The recording is ideal- typical for perfectionist Fagen.<br /><br />A pass at the songs-<br /><br />1) Slinky Thing- funky- love the horns and xylophone- an older guy chasing or with a young chick and doubting himself.<br /><br />2) I'm Not the Same Without You- love the melodica, which Donald uses more on Sunken Condos than on any other CD's and handles it like a madman--- very upbeat-- and optimistic about a break up- think the opposite of The Things I Miss the Most from Everything Must Go. Great vocals! Takes all of Steely Dan and solo efforts---shakes `em up--- and pours out one of the best songs he's ever written.<br /><br />3) Memorabilia- great muted horns, sweet and soulful. More great vocals. The gals do a great job of complimenting Donald.<br /><br />4) Weather in My Head- very bluesy- more outstanding horns/backing vocals- super nice guitar solo- B.B Kingish- I assume its Jon Herrington.<br /><br />5) The New Breed- reminds me of Gaucho's My Rival--- organs--- freakin' great horns- and more melodica. More vocal harmonies. Donald's voice as strong as ever.<br /><br />6) Out of the Ghetto (Isaac Hayes cover)- very funky--think War's Slippin' Into Darkness. \\"I took you out of the ghetto, but I could not get the ghetto out of you.\\"<br /><br />7) Miss Marlene- THIS SONG TOTALLY ROCKS- a little I.G.Y., a little Ruby Baby. Vocal blend is unbelievable- takes the best of SD-- gives me the chills--another totally great guitar solo by Herrington.<br /><br />8) Good Stuff- TOTALLY FUNK-EEEE! Love the off key piano- more out-freakin'-ragous muted horns-- melodica-- xylophone---backing vocals--think Haitian Divorce--sounds like a Sopranos episode, both lyrical and musically--- \\"East Patterson\\"-- reprise of  \\"There's a special satisfaction when a job comes off so right- better break out the good stuff, the boss wants to party all night.\\"<br /><br />9) Planet d'Rhonda- Jazzy- \\"somewhere between 19 and 38\\"--sweet with more outstanding vocal arrangement--AND yet more Herrington guitar. Think Chain Lightening--- stretchin' out, like Donald said \\"Have at it, Jon\\". \\"My friends say `Jim, you're on a deadly spree.' They just can't understand that D's my vitamin XYZ.\\"<br /><br />I guarantee the reviews will praise Sunken Condos, proving you don't get old--you get better. I don't know what's gotten into Donald, but it's ridiculously good. Sunken Condos is an epiphany for Fagen, like vintage wine that has fermented for hundreds of years, is opened, and will be enjoyed for many more.cho's My Rival--- organs--- freakin' great horns- and more melodica.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This unique story is a \\"cancer\\" book without being a cancer book. Perhaps because we know up front that the main character has cancer, it's less of a stark topic of the book, yet having a terminal illness is a constant theme. I guess I want to tell people not to put this story aside just because it deals with cancer...it's such a great book, on so many levels, it shouldn't be shelved so easily.<br /><br />It's also in the Young Adult category, but if I hadn't known that, I wouldn't categorize it as YA myself.<br /><br />This is a love story, and John Green does such a good job casting Hazel, the main character, in a way that we really get to know her, get to go inside her head and understand her dilemmas, her faults, her strengths, her desires.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how easy this book was to read, yet it's so complex, it's topics heavy, it's story thick and rich. I wholeheartedly recommend it!

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this series on TV and want to own every season. I received this on time and in good condition! I order the shows I really like so I can watch them when there is nothing else on TV which I find a lot of.
B000002LOM|5.0|I've always loved this. It stands alone from his catalog in it's own quaint little way. It may not be his best but I think all the naysayers are just jumping on the bandwagon and not listening to it for themselves. Like all great Morrissey albums it has many strong tracks that can run through my mind endlessly. Morrissey's got a great ear for melody, that pop sensibility--the fabled \\"hook\\" that is often missing from today's music.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain, I love her music and listen to them daily. I love the upbeat songs the best. What a great pick me up to my day! I received this on time and in perfect condition.
B004LSO7IS|5.0|The movie \\"Elena Undone\\" completely touched me very deeply. In fact, I am using the film as a basis for better learning the craft of screen writing.<br /><br />Everyone that had a part in the film did such a tremendously good job. I must say, I have watched it at least 20 times now, and have it listed as one of my favorite movies on NetFlix.<br /><br />Necar and Traci were absolutely dynamic. They had such great chemistry. They helped to make the film top-notch. If they didn't get an award for best actors, I don't know why.<br /><br />The plot was developed so well that it was easy to follow. There was plenty of tension between characters. The dialogue was sharp.<br /><br />Nicole did an excellent job in directing the film. I consider her to be one of the best directors in Hollywood.<br /><br />Thank you so much for creating the movie. Everyone that had a part in creating and presenting the film have to be commended for doing such a wonderful job. It was a well-rounded and very professionally done film.

0062127241|4.0|I guess Townshend has mellowed a bit, because even though he's very honest about his private life, his drinking and method of writing, he hardly spends any time going into detail over the 1965 problems the band had with Roger Daltrey, and the problems the band had with Shel Talmy and the lousy controling contract that causes the band to actually be signed through Decca (which made their records issued in the UK on Brunswick, which was used to issue US Decca material).<br /><br />He also didn't spend much time on recording techniques, and other cool insider information about singles like \\"Dogs\\", \\"Magic Bus, \\"Join Together\\" or \\"Relay\\".<br /><br />I'm glad he wrote his memoirs and I'm glad I bought it, but I wish he had been a bit detailed about The Who's life in the studio, as well as the significant politics within the band.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome app. Great game for kids and teens. Also great for archietects and engineers. There is a free version on 4shared.com and type in MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION FOR KINDLE FIRE or ANDROID. And then you just download it and ham it is exactlly the same as the paid app.
B008RTE09S|5.0|Much better then the video transfer copy circulating over the last few years. Real good quality. The bonus features contain commentary by Paul over a slightly muted audio soundtrack of the film. Ringo also has a say on selected parts. Great outtake footage and lots of behind the scenes footage. You won't be dissappointed.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Joyful movie about seniors who retire to India. Their experiences, the relationships that develop, and the colors and mayhem of India make for an enjoyable little film.

030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I'm an impatient reader - I need a fast-paced plot that draws me in immediately in order to fully commit to a novel, and that's what I got with Gone Girl. The story is told in alternating points of view, from the perspectives of Nick (husband and prime suspect) and the diary of Amy (the woman who's gone missing). Each character is richly developed with deliciously dark humor woven into the narrative. The author keeps the reader wondering, and the constant, unpredictable twists in the plot were what kept me turning pages in the middle of the night.<br /><br />I have to agree with other reviewers on the only negative of this novel - the ending was indeed a disappointment. Up until the final two pages of this 400+ page novel, I was fully invested in the story and needed to know the outcome. Apart from this minor let-down, Gone Girl is deserving of five stars.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this app to my kindle for my 5yr old grandson. He was having fun until his sister tried it. She was hooked. I didn't think I was going to get my kindle back. But because it was getting mire challenging I started playing now I'm hooked. This app is truly fun and addicting. I love it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice graphics and fun to play. Hours of fun and very addicting. More fun than bejeweled. It is entertaining for kids too.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Engaging and challenging game! I really enjoy the levels, new challenges, and graphics.  I never want to stop playing, it makes the time just fly by...
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|this game had no challenge.  I would rather waste my time cleaning the cat box.  it also froze my kindle fire.  I have deleted the game.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|An interesting and slow start to this story. The tempo picks up quickly and the pages are turned quickly as you are lead through a story that has many twists and turns. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The best thing about this program is that you can ask it for only deals that are possible to win. Then, if you fail, you can play the same deal again.Then, if you still fail you can save the deal to try another day. Also, the game will do a winning run through for you, and then let you try again.So...you can really learn strategies and approaches to improve your skills. There ate also hints and auto-complete for the last easy moves when you DO win. This is the solitaire program I've always wanted.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I started this book with great anticipation and kept reading hoping I would eventually begin to find it interesting, enjoyable, etc. This never happened. I could have cared less for the characters. The plot was a snore. Perhaps not living in England makes it more difficult for me to embrace the story. I still look forward to Ms. Rowling's next writing project.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|I love this movie, it has everything, Guy Ritchie is great! I can wait for The Real RockNRolla, I home that movie become reality.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great take on the match 3 game.  The graphics are beautiful anc the game play smooth on my Droid 4. Lots of fun and addictive game play.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|lyrics, music, guitar, bass, drums etc is welded together to make the best rock album of the year.<br />every song is iPod worthy.
0316228532|5.0|I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews on the profanity and subject matter, this is no different that a lot of other adult fiction books I have read.  That being said, this book has very interesting, if not very likeable characters.  I had a hard time deciding which one I disliked the most!  Some are pretty despicable. The story is interesting too.  I like the way each chapter is from a different person's point of view.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game. I got it as a free app on my kindle fire and it's addicting. highly recommend.<br />Love it....
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is a fascinating book written in an unusual  style in first person for both of the main characters.  We read it as a book club book, and I started taking notes, and I realized there were so many twists and turns that what I thought was true wasn't true at all.  It was, however, easy to read, and the format and style kept my interest.  The author must have had a massive story board and outline to keep up with twists and turns in the book.  The characters were very well developed.  It makes one wonder just what makes some people seem so normal, and then there are all these characters.  Really mixed up people in this book.  Being from Missouri, I liked the references to places I knew.  I highly recommend the book as an individual read or as a book club selection.  It raises lots of questions and discussion topics.
B009G78EE2|5.0|My wife and I listen to it daily!  It has inspirational songs, funny songs, serious songs ect.  It is just an amazing cd that I believe is probably top 5 best hip hop albums of all time!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A real page turner with wonderful characters.  I read it in a few days and re-read it again as soon as I finished it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have heard various individuals make comments about how 50 shades is just about sex. Well to me it wasn't, it was more than just sex....it was a nice love story behind it all and showed how it takes two to make a relationship work and that running away from problems won't solve them.<br /><br />This is a must read book along with the other two. Can't wait for Christian's version to come out!!!
B009RIMPIG|5.0|Fun! Flirty! Witty! Mystery! And endless twists and turns that all resolve with our heroic couple landing in clover (in this case, in Castle's fantasy bed). Full to the brim with chuckles and luscious views and the charm that has enchanted us all for the last four years, \\"Murder He Wrote\\" has EVERYTHING you could want for one of the most pleasant and satisfying hour of entertainment EVER.  This is a Must-Own episode if ever there was one!  FIVE STARS easy-peasy.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun but little boring. Would like little more excitement.  Overall good game. Try it for yourself.  Enjoy the fun today
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|reminds me of Vegas with coin machine. I could play this for hours. only wish there were more coins each day
0142410322|4.0|At the end of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie Buckett, who has just won a whole chocolate factory from Willy Wonka the eccentric candy maker, is flying through the sky in a great glass elevator along with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Buckett, his grandparents, Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine, and Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina, and Mr. Wonka.  They visit the world's first space hotel, but the astronauts who are shuttling the staff to the hotel, and everyone on earth watching the proceedings, including President of the United States Lancelot R. Gilligrass, think that the glass elevator is a space capsule carrying aliens.  Then when Charlie and the others land on the space hotel, they find that it has been invaded by real aliens.  Who are the invaders?  Where did they come from?  Will Charlie and his friends escape or will they be gobbled up by the aliens?<br /><br />  Roald Dahl has written some good books and some not-so-good ones.  James and the Giant Peach and Fantastic Mr. Fox are all right but nothing to write home about.  The Vicar of Nibbleswick is not among my favorites.  And Mathilda is one with which I definitely have some objections.  However, I really liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  It was a fun story that also illustrated some good principles.  Sequels are seldom as good as the originals, and that is the case here.  It seems as if Dahl was pressed to provide a follow-up and did so without a real cohesive theme.  Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is certainly not a bad book, and most kids will probably like it.  A few common euphemisms (heck, golly, gee) occur; the phrase \\"O my lord\\" is used once as an interjection; the Nanny-Vice-President sings of the President, \\"I used to sit him on the pot and wait for him to wee;\\" and there is a reference to drinking gin.  Otherwise, it is a somewhat silly children's tale, and there is nothing necessarily wrong with that.  But it is a bit disconnected and lacks much of the charm of its predecessor.decessor.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this game it couldn't be better. As soon as I started playing this game I realized how awesome it was
B00005LK94|5.0|I purchased the DVD of \\"\\"Fly Away Home.\\"  It arrived well before I expected it. The DVD quality was fine.  I enjoyed the story.  It was what I expected.  And now I am passing it on for friends to enjoy.  I would buy from this seller again.
B008YW5RH2|1.0|Controls are not good. Already uninstalled. Not a great product. See others.display is good. Motion is not good. Fewer gaming options. Not able to serve properly.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game can keep you entertained for hours and makes youbthink ahead beforenyou make your move. Ireccomend this game for people who love card games.
1466401885|5.0|Wow! What a book! I was expecting this to be a book kinda like 50 shades and boy was I in for a shock. This book told more of a story and wasnt about constant sex. The characters had sex in this book maybe twice with vague details. It is more about a girl who loses a bet and moved in with her controlling \\"boyfriend.\\" It is really a GREAT book and I recommend you buy it.
B0006AP1F8|4.0|Hitlers boast that the Third Reich would last a Thousand Years, is still relevant, as this same Doctrine in Political Form still exists today.<br />The English  complete edition published by Houghton/Millflin Boston Copyright 1939, is closest to the original Translated text as possible, later published copies are ALTERED.The significance of this \\"unabridged\\" copy is the pattern that this form of political correctness follows, Mein Kampf presents a distinct  pattern of psychological manipulation/warfare that is used, (in all forms), in this case,  Hitler uses common phrases and sentiments,  that people of that time could identify and recognize, in this manner Hitler gained their trust by presenting these common interests, once this level of trust was established, the process of manipulation then becomes more and more radical and deviant  to justify any and all actions political and military, in what  then becomes a self perpetrating process of more control and power over the trust, that now no longer counts as recourse for the people.<br />The importance of Hitlers manuscript is that it provides a written example of the Form of Psychological Warfare and Political Correctness that can then be used to identify other forms of this corruption in politics of power that as evidenced throughout History seeks to DOMINATE, not preserve and protect life and freedom.<br />The Relationship between Hitler and His Book are  not entirely understood, and deserves further study even today.<br />Hitler states in the opening pages of the \\"unabridged\\" copy, that \\"many have asked that our program be written down\\", Hitler had this opportunity in 1924 after being sentenced to 9 months in prison for attempting to overthrow the German Govt,  and act that could have carried a possible death sentence.<br />The intent of Hitlers manifesto ,to create a \\"Legal\\" Document , that would become Statute \\"Law\\" for Germany.<br />The circumstances and setting (prison)where this New \\"Law\\" was formed,  by the conclusions and opinions of Hitler and a few others who shared Prison accommodations ,  was not a relevant concern  , among this convention and process of prison inmates.<br />Once this aspect of Hitlers manuscript is contemplated, the IMPLICATIONS of this \\"Law\\" and application can then be better discerned, for its degenerative properties of absolute power beyond restraint and accountability.<br />After Hitlers release from Prison, 1924, Hitler Kept the INTENT of this \\"Law\\" to Himself,  the subsequent publishing of Mein Kampf in German and Later in English was not widely read or understood for that matter, by Allied Leaders OR German Generals, what was  also not apparent was the relationship between Hitler and His Book.<br />In 1933 Hitler was offered the Post of Chancellor, from this point on Hitler being the LIVING Edition of His Book/Law, in Mind and Body, was then , as He saw it, the Ordained Incarnate Representative of this Book and Law.<br />With Hitler the Law in Person, every Physical act , idea, word from Hitler , as Law, had to be fulfilled.<br />Nothing was presented in Printed matter.  The section of Hitlers Mein Kampf concerning the right of self defense, would be the primary \\"authority\\" that allowed Hitler wide authority in the USE OF MILITARY FORCE.<br />Hitlers first actions under this 'Authority\\" was to abrogate the Versailles Treaty, then reinstate conscription and arms production, under this 'authority' Hitler ordered reoccupation of the Rhineland, and then Czechoslovakia, and then outright aggressive War against Poland.<br />The Allies Declared War against Germany on Sept 3, 1939.<br />The Self Defense Authority Law of Hitlers book, then worked neatly in the aspect  of placing the Allies , France and Britain as the aggressors, by their Declaration of War. Hitler by his own Law, was not legally obligated to Declare War in this case of self defense of Germany.<br />  It requires GREAT effort to read through the HEAVY SUBJECT MATTER, of 993 pagesand 15 Chapters.<br />What become apparent after reading this in its entirety, is a pattern of repetitive same argument, Complaint, and Comment that lasts the entire 993 pages, the 15 Chapters appear to also be of suggestive subjective matter.<br />  The constant repetition  of HITLERS  same Complaint, over 993 pages , is the attempt to CONVINCE the individual reading it, to think the same way.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Being a college student, we have reverted to using pdfs instead of textbooks. The majority of my classwork involves reading and looking back at pdfs. I used my Kindle Fire mainly for PDF purposes and I wanted to be able to highlight and write on it without having to print out the paper (my major is sustainability so that would defeat the purpose :)) This will make speaking in class much easier as I have something to refer to instead of writing out notes!<br /><br />If you are looking for annotating and highlighting PDFs then this app is for you!<br /><br />P.S. Also helps if you have a stylus, but not necessary.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I was so settled in for the read, and poof it was over. I guess I've been spoiled by the length of most post-apocalyptic books.Maybe he will write a series.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game is very challenging and fun!! Many different items to collect and use in a pinch!! Waiting to see where it leads.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|good graphics, nice sound, good game, nice story plot, if you like jewel quest, you will like this game too.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Got this one on a recomendation. It is one of the best. Great graphics and a decent story line. Not too hard of a game, but it keeps you interested.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|After reading this latest book, I still have no idea what has happened to Sansa, Arya, Jamie or the various wolves.  I guess I will create my own ending.......<br />In my conclusion, Jon Snow will recover and go on to save the Starks and reunite the remaining dire wolves.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|So we take American history mix it in with Tim Burton and modern horror like vampires and we get this not so bad movie. I think overall it didn't do well as people find history not to be messed with by Hollywood but this was a book that I enjoyed years ago and the movie left a few key elements but it was worth watching.
B0086449YA|5.0|Privateering is the most fabulously recorded album I have every heard.  You can hear every instrument and the sound they produce together is about a mile wide.  Love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is much better than the movie. My advice is to read all the books, then the movie would make sense.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down once I started & now im on book 2 &  getting ready to start book 3!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My husband and I must have been the only people in the world who had not seen this enchanting movie.  After we recently viewed it from Netflix, I decided to buy a copy of it for my mother, who loves both trains and Christmas.  I can't wait to give it to her for her birthday in early December.  She will love it.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|The films in this collection were second to none.  I even bought them when I had another copy of some of the movies.  The additional material is worth it alone.  Paramount put together the definitive John Wayne collection.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't usually read these kinds of books.  I'm really more of a science fiction reader and anything that can happen to someone in modern day bores me.  Then came The Perks of Being a Wallflower.  Currently I am going through a lot of hard things just like Charlie does in the book and so I can relate to him.  I have never read a book that so eloquently touches matters in such detail and puts you on such an emotional roller coaster!  Like Charlie says in the book this is my favorite book, but maybe that's only because its the most recent book I've read.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I pre-ordered this book on the assumption that any work from her would be very good, and quite possibly great.  I was wrong.  It is not that good, and certainly not a great read.  It is one of those books, that the reader sticks with, expecting it to get better, or expecting at the end to realize it made a point or an impact.  Again, to me - it did not.  To me it was a mediocre soap opera.  A story that might play better on screen, in a series like Desperate Housewives, than written as a novel by an author as noted as J.K. Rowling.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Totally engrossing,,,and very addictive.  Once you get the hang of it, time starts to fly. I have to set a timer so that I don't stay up all night
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is the first of a great collection. We have not been disappointed in them at all.I highly recommend them to others.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|was ok not as funny as it was made out to be but did have a few hilarious scenes.  All in all it was ok.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Wonderful. We will be anxiously waiting for Season 5. I have the entire collection now, minus the 5th season, but I will get that as soon as it is available
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The movie was very good action packed.  My son and I both enjoyed it and would watch it again. It was more than i expected.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It is a very good app. REALLY!!! I have had the app for about a year now then all of a sudden I wont let me download or watch any videos  on there. VERY DISPOINTING!!!!!!! Loved it then it turned on me. so sad. :(
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This app will let you decide the level of competition you need to become a better opponent. Playing a computer is hard but here you set your own level for a game.which makes for a better game of chess.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a very nice, simple app that is easy to use. The graphics aren't bad and overall, its entertaining.
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I also experienced the weird glith thingy. It would reset everything... except my chatacter stats and purchases. not worth the space.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest!!!! Awesome ideas and recipes!!!! Definitely recommend to every one, I'm really enjoying all the Holiday ideas!!!! Download right now!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest.... there is something for everyone on here. If you like to cook read a book or just look... you can find something that will be in your realm of interest! If you don't see what like here find it on another site and pin it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book of the Hunger Games trilogy is every bit as good as the first one. I bought this one to read via the Kindle App on my phone. Even though it was a small screen it still only took a couple of days to read it as I devoured every page.
B007PVHANM|5.0|For any Bob Marley fan. This is a must have. This film takes you on a journey which follows Bob Marleys life from birth to death. It show you interviews from his family to his closest friends. Some which has never been seen. You will not be disappoint for the film makes a connection with the great Bob Marley and integers you right from the start. The best of 2012. You will wish Bob was still alive today.
B005LQ6UE8|5.0|One of the best books I have read, I counld not lay it down. It saden me to read what people will do to other people, but then again you have people who can and will help others in need. Very well written book. I recomen it.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|This is one of my wife's favorite movies - she really like vampire movies. Glad we got it on blu-ray. It was worth it.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|After reading this book I could see my webshop in a totally new way. The book is full of good and easy-to-use advises.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The only negative thing I can say about this book is that I can't read it fast enough. I was reading it within minutes of ordering it online for my Kindle. Will be purchasing the next book in the series later today or tomorrow.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I really love this cd, I think it's the best No Doubt has done to date. Listened to it 3 times when I 1st downloaded it. Love the musical arrangement and the song harmonies.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|In short, this album is OUTSTANDING!  Rush-tuned ears will be able to hear culminations of earlier works like Xanadu, Permanent Waves, and 2112, among others, in a wonderful rock-heavy blend. The editing and sound quality, too, are top-notch. The critics are correct when they praise this release.<br /><br />Besides being harder rock than their late-career, mature sound (Snakes & Arrows), this album is tuneful and purposeful, being a themed if not \\"concept\\" album. I for one was ecstatic to hear the Moog Taurus bass pedals used so liberally, as if it were 1978 again and Rush the hottest prog rock thing going. My favorite songs are \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" and \\"The Anarchist\\" with \\"Clockwork Angels\\" in third place.<br /><br />This album is anything but a rehash, or a release from a band that ought to have quit decades before. This is hot. Was it simply the move to Roadrunner Records, or is it true Rush sought more independence by changing labels so they could rock harder? It is somehow vintage Rush, and totally new, at the same time. Few of their albums have come this close, in my view, to  their musical vision, having explored so many tangents.<br /><br />If any Rush fans have not heard this yet (which I'd find surprising), and they were worried that Rush might be running out of steam, throw this one in the CD player and turn the volume as loud as you can stand it.
B0029OR9JU|4.0|I hear string arrangements similar to those in Madman Across the Water, sparse guitar from Neil Young's French cousin, and Melody's disarmingly real laughter, which you come to understand by the 3rd listen. Oh and Serge Gainsbourg's chain-smoking talk/sing pre-Leonard Cohen's vocals are pretty cool too. Limited French vocabulary reveals \\"red hair\\" (her natural color), \\"l'attraction fatale\\" and \\"Merde!\\". I understand an English translation is available but I'm afraid it won't retain the same mystique afterward.
0446580848|5.0|Admittedly, I am a long-time John Corey fan.  I keep expecting the author to eventually run out of the smart-alec remarks that John Corey is famous for, but he just keeps 'em coming.  In The Panther, John and his wife Kate are sent over to Yemen (\\"If the earth had an anus, it would be located in Yemen\\"), ostensibly for one purpose, but of course office politics within the Anti-Terrorist Task Force, FBI, and CIA quickly turn it into something entirely different and, of course, far more dangerous.  Nelson DeMille's talent lies in maintaining the irreverent character of John Corey while simultaneously writing a tense, thriller plot.  The story is fast-paced, which keeps the reader's attention, while experiencing laugh-out-loud moments when Corey makes his random observations (\\"But the problem, as I saw it when I was there, was that we had a very small American presence in a very hostile environment.  A recipe for disaster.  Ask General Custer about that.\\")<br /><br />As usual, DeMille uses current Middle East events to fuel his plot.  Given his character's ties to 9-11, he creates taut, believable (for those of us not in law enforcement, lol) scenarios that keep you on the edge of your seat.  If you haven't read a John Corey novel, it's perfectly okay to start with this one.  Just be prepared to want to go back and read all the previous ones!  As long as DeMille keeps writing them like this, I'll be buying them.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I got this as the free app of the day. It keeps me busy. I don't really get the little mini games between the levels, but over all I enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the movie. Of coarse the book had more details which was great but the movie was pretty accurate.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|Good game, but don't buy games. 1st level is good, quick with beginners and expert level for all ages would recommend for all ages.
0525953728|5.0|This book was amazing! I loved reading it from the author's point of view. Nothing political, just an honest account of what happened!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Product is very sturdy, lightweight, and easy to insert and remove kindle into.<br />Am very pleased for the money I spent.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I use this and music bay and honestly im thinking abiut uninstalling.music bay, this is all ive needed. Just make sure if ur using a GS3, u dont interrupt the download. =)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!  I enjoy playing it!  It keeps my mind active and is pretty challenging at times. And it's actually pretty good to be free!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|In spite of the age, I thought this movie was fantastic!  This movie had a great plot, and a decent cast...  I give Jennifer Agutter two thumbs up...
B004YM6JLO|1.0|I order vampire dairies season 3 on 9/11/12 and its 10/16/12 and i still have not gotten it. I have been waiting everyday fr it and it still has not comw.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|A quick read and very funny. I recommend cat owners read this little graphic book. I will probably check out other books by the oatmeal.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|i am a very big fan of rick reordon already and these books are  jyst adding to my pile of books( only rick reordan books )
031620157X|5.0|The story wasn't focused on one thing. Lots of things took place and it was exciting. It was definitely a book I couldn't put down.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really nice. Before I knew it an hour had passed and I was late. Beware can be addicting! Keep up the nice work. I will check out more by this developer.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Best 2 hours and 23 minutes I have spent enjoying a movie in quite a while. Whats not to like? Marvel Comics,star power with accomplished and entertaining actors and actresses, wonderful special effects, excellent story line and plot, action packed and keeps you entertained constantly with no dead fill or dragging scenes. Just loved it. Recommend highly if you are into the Super hero theme. Thor, Captain America, Iron Man one and two were quite enjoyable as well and actually sets up a little background info on some of the Characters in this movie for the Marvel Novices. This one the best by far however. Left the movie Hulk out on purpose as Eric Bana 2003 version drags,acting is third rate,and it stunk worse then a public restroom on a hot day! That directors name Ang Lee should add the H in front of his first name for making the movie. As far as Edward Norton s version although a fine actor, the movie was just OK, he just was not believable in the role.
B009IF7JRA|5.0|The one thing I can say about this episode is tasteful, and at the same time it was elegant! I am talking about the musical part with Sarah Jessica Parker. It reminded me of an Audrey Hepburn movie such as Funny Face. Her and Chris Colfer voices blended so well I hope we get to hear more of them together.<br />The entire story was great which was a BIG lead up to the Next show \\"The Break UP\\"<br />I am glad to see Rachel (because of Kurt) stand up for herself FINALLY!!! to here bitch dance teacher, and at the same time reality is finally sinking into her.<br />I love my Glee and there is NOTHING I could say anything bad about it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|this game is a lot of fun...its addicting and one of the best free games I have played in a while...very easy to understand without lot of instructions
B00000637V|5.0|Has a better, more poignant rock album ever been recorded?  Has any work defied and withstood the test of time more gracefully than than this?<br /><br />I first listened to Berlin thirty years ago and it just didn't connect, either musically or intellectually.  But a relistening of the record today demonstrates that it as relevant as ever and it was certainly decades ahead of its time.  The transitions, bass line, and recordings of crying children combine to make The Kids a classic within a classic.  Berlin is, quite simply, a masterpiece.
B002OFWG7E|3.0|From a standpoint of overall fidelity these versions sound better than the ones on Itunes simply because they are lossless, however there is more clipping on these versions due to them being mastered too loud. I'll never understand this need to intentionally add distortion into music in order to make it play ear deafeningly loud on a portable music player. Keep that in mind when choosing this purchase.  \\"All My Life\\" is particularly bad as it already has clipping on every version I've ever heard.
0452287022|5.0|Greit's father is blinded by a kiln explosion, leaving her family without an income. Consequently, at the age of sixteen, her mother hires Greit out as a maid for the great painter, Vermeer, and his family. Greit works hard at the difficult work, becoming victim of the eldest child's cruelty and of the other maids' jealousy. One of her chores is to clean the master painter's studio, without moving a thing. She does her chore carefully, while becoming more and more fascinated by the master's work. Little by little, Greit begins to take on more responsibilities in aiding the great painter.<br /><br />This book is awesome! Through Greit's eyes, we get an inside glimpse of Vermeer's techniques. This is a tender look at one lowly maid's visions of great art.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like this app. The only thing I do not like is that it keeps pestering you to review it. I reccomend it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was excited to get the sequel. I loved the book and have already reread it! I think I may love the first book more. Mostly because it seems to cover more o a time period. Book two has some intense sex scenes that were nicely protrayed.  There are some things that were left unresolved. I am<br />Looking forward to book 3. I would recommend this.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|It was great until one day it started working incorrectly - only one side of my headphones received the sound and I jiggled it and it still failed.  I checked the other components and they work fine.  Tried other headphones with this equalizer too and the same problem occured.<br /><br />Worked like a gem until now but I think selling a product that only lasts for 9 months is unacceptable.  Granted, it was $27 so perhaps you only get 9 months of the product for that price...
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I like my tv shows and comic books to be not wildly apart as they are in some other shows. It is impossible to be exact, of course, but massive kudos to the makers of this show for consistently living up to the narrative arc and structure of the comics. The comics just passed the 100th issue and are way ahead of where the tv show is but there is no problem for me in following both. In both, the major characters are Rick and his son Carl. Carl is Rick's prime motivation for pressing on. He can't bear to give up for his son's sake.<br /><br />We open with two classic events which occur in the comics. First, the characters discover a prison. They now realize they need a fortified home and isolated houses and farms will not work against the zombies. So the prison is a solution to their need for fortification. They of course have to take the prison away from the zombies first, which is half the fun.<br /><br />Second, we finally meet one of the biggest characters from the comics version, Michonne. She is a lawyer who uses a sword like Darryl uses his crossbow. Those who are experts with relatively soundless weapons are highly prized in this world because the zombies can hear guns and tend to swarm towards the sound of gunfire. Michonne is as important as a right hand man to Rick as Daryl is.<br /><br />A special note about the actor who plays Rick, Andrew Lincoln. Much to my surprise, he is a British actor. I recently saw him in a BBC show and it took me about twenty minutes to figure out why he looked so familiar (but did not sound at all the same). I couldn't believe that this actor playing a British CEO was the same actor playing southern American deputy sheriff Rick! It was essential to the show that Rick be perfectly cast and he was. It is as if he stepped out of the pages of the comic books and this is absolutely crucial.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this is a reallygood game. its a very addictive gamewith a lot of brain exersizing too. ive caught myself playing it for hours and notevenrealizing how long I was playing. I wish there were more games like this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This show is a huge family saga and historical romance.  I always think I will resist being pulled into this world. Every single time after the first episode, I am once again a DA addict. Just try pulling me away!<br /><br />Right off the top, let me get something off my chest.  I THINK BATES IS GUILTY. Am I the only one to think that way? I  just do not see his late wife, a character who lived for revenge, killing herself, which is the only alternative. I guess you could argue that this was a primo act of revenge but she was doing fabulously well against Bates and Anna revenge wise with limitless prospects for further success. Why end such a pleasurable experience which she could watch endlessly unfold?  She was already making them absolutely miserable! If it turns out she was a suicide, I think it is the only misstep the writers made. So this remains a big plot element in season three downstairs with Anna still trying to exonerate him.<br /><br />Upstairs we have the wedding for Matthew and Lady Mary with further quarrels leading them all the way to the altar.  These two will not have a staid marriage and that is all to the good. Sybil is present with Tom and will be shortly delivering her baby. Hugh Bonneville, the lord and master of the abbey, is again beset on all sides.  He makes many mistakes based on his aristocratic viewpoint of the world.  At heart this is the prime problem for all of these people, they grew up in an aristocracy and the aristocracy is precisely what is no longer needed in post world war one England.<br /><br />But the best characters are the three older women, the matriarchs of all other characters.  These are the dowager countess, played wonderfully by Maggie Smith, Matthew's mother, and Shirley MacLaine as the present countess's American mother. You would think the dowager countess would be a complete anachronism with the future being firmly represented by the other two matriarchs.  However, as the power behind the throne, Smith is incredible.  There is always power behind the throne and it is often a woman who has it.  Smith thus continues to be a major delight.<br /><br />As usual, I am anxiously awaiting the next episode.  sigh.....<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00280LYIC|5.0|Classic.  Whenever we can't find a new book that's interesting we go back and re-read the Percy Jackson series...we've read it about 6 times now and it's still fun.  My kid knows way more about Greek mythology now than I did at her age.  Highly recommend this series (Percy Jackson and the Olympians) and the follow-up series, the Heroes of Olympus.
034580404X|5.0|Would recommend Fifty Shades Trilogy to anyone that is an adult.....man or women!  These books open your eyes, hearts & minds, to things most of us wouldn't dream of thinking about!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|basically a quest game with mostly a bejeweld type theme. good time waster. find the clues and knock them off the bottom while matching 3 pics in a row.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is great it has some adventure and so puzzle. love it. its awesome call of Atlantis is great
B005D67OLE|5.0|So well a acted and directed and look forward to every show. Not your typical cop show. It holds its tenseness through the whole episode.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. Read it all he way through without putting it down. Need to get the next one going please!!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I felt obligated to complete the series once I had started it, but I was not held in fascination as I was in the first book.  I was pretty worn out with the characters by the end.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|Mathlab Pro is needed on the Kindle Paperwhite and Fire/HD.  For students who read math books a good graphic calculator is a significant value added app.  Amazon and Mathlab should consider the millions of students that would buy this app.[[ASIN:B0085PFG1U Mathlab Graphing Calculator (PRO)]]
B0097AX6EQ|5.0|Grippingly honest account of a chopper pilot's fight for survival in a torrid war managed by idiots. Another read that keeps you up all night.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love pinterest love the app.  it works great have not had. any problems with it working properly it has let me keep up with what is being pinned daily
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I don't think anything compares to Fifty Shades Trilogy but Reflected In You and Bared to You are a pretty close match.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I loved it, and am completely hooked. I've already started on book three. I wish I would have discovered the maps sooner; it's a nice reference point.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|love it its the best game I have ever played in my whole entire live I love it with all my heart
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a great game, very high quality and fun. The graphics are great, the music is great. It's just as good as Fishdom, but adds some other game elements (hidden object, etc.). Very fun and relaxing! Gets tougher very quick.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. I didn't like the ending, but that's because the viewer does not know what happened after the ending. You are left wondering. Over all a good movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great continuation to the Lost Heroes series. It's great to see the characters again in a new venue.
B007L7JY3Y|1.0|I just installed this app on my Kindle Fire and there is no option to add a new task. I have an option to add a new calendar, but it won't save. I hope I can get my money back from Amazon.
0345803493|5.0|for those that think this is a gross book about sex, you are wrong .....it has a beautiful story line........I loooooooved it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great ideas everywhere about everything. Love using it for classroom lessons, home ideas, recipes, etc.  Great that I can share with others.the great ideas I've. found
0345803507|5.0|it was worth reading all three books , i hope she comes out with a fourth one......however, I'm not looking forward to a movie because i already know i will be upset because the director will mess u with my beautiful story I've developed in my mind....LOL......totally recommend reading all three
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book. It is a love story with a kinky and it just get better. the second book is better than the first and the third book leaves you wanting more.
B000HEVALC|5.0|The disk was fine, I played it.  And then I used it as a birthdaY gift to a friend who I know is a great Elvis fan.  He loved it.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|P!nk never ceases to amaze me, her silky voice on her ballads is so smooth, her humor and danceable beats just make this an Awesome Album that has hours of play on it.  I listen to this album every chance I get, especially at work when the hours seem to not want to stop, P!nk is my pick-me-up.  FANTASTIC ALBUM Mrs P!nk.
B005FISBTO|3.0|I'm a huge Dexter fan, but as other reviewers have stated, this DVD is ruined by the preview that shows you the last scene of the final episode.  My other beef is that this DVD, that I purchased from Amazon was defective, yet when I read the return policy it stated that only \\"unopened\\" DVD's were returnable.  I missed two episodes that sputtered, skipped and stopped.
B004X75RK4|1.0|I thought that while the plot was a bit predictable it could still be a good \\"chick flick.\\" I was very disappointed.  There was a lot (as in the amount of skin) of nudity!!!  Seemed like grounds for \\"R\\" to me.  And the turn of events were so subtle that it seemed as though the affections of the couple were out of place.  The nudity, however, was my biggest complaint!
B008NHS5K4|5.0|In 2012 a new release of the \\"chante Piaf\\"-album which contains two absolutely new recorded songs (July 2012) by la Mathieu: \\"A quoi ca sert l´amour\\" and \\"La goualante du pauvre Jean\\". Extended with the 1985 recording of \\"Les trois cloches\\", you find on this product 16 songs par excellence. The voice of Miss Mathieu is one of the best ever in the world; she´s absolutely popular in my country (Germany) as in the most countries of good old Europe and this has a reason: Her quality, her feeling for the music, her brillant voice which for me is the best ever(!) of all female artists.<br />Listen to these songs, they all are so wonderful and joyful. This CD is a real gift!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Should I be worried that the zombies don't bother me at all after 2 full seasons? ;-) ;-)  Great season premiere.  A good set up for another few months of nail biting action.
0307591549|5.0|The Happiness Advantage Helped Win a Toastmaster Contest!<br /><br />As I was reading this book before the contest, I noted 2 pieces of fun research I could share with my friend, a contestant in the table topics contest. I told her to keep her mind on something that filled her with joy while waiting for her turn. She did.  I also showed her a chocolate chip cookie. I told her she could eat it only after her turn. As soon as she returned from center stage she asked, \\"Can I have my cookie now?\\"<br /><br />When the winners were announced, she was shocked to learn she had won. Now she has a treasured trophy to share with her family and friends.<br /><br />The Happiness Advantage is filled with fun research on how to be happy. One I like using is to write 3 things I look forward to everyday. I'm finding that when I look forward to pleasant events, I find them everywhere.<br /><br />Jean Tracy, MSS<br />Author of `Character Building for Kids: Cartoon Guide to Good Manners with Family Discussions'
B000ICXQGK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. Robin williams playing a serious role, and doing it well. This is a great bittersweet love story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app. I have it for my android and I just installed it on my Kindl. Please make more games like this one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I highly suggest this alarm clock app. I've used it for several months now and it NEVER lets me down. There are a lot of options to customize the alarm to your needs & wants.<br />2 years later and still loving this app. Used everyday for the last 2 years, and has still never failed me!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Whilst I personally preferred the second book in the Trilogy. This one doesn't disappoint either. It still satisfies & leaves you wanting more...
0525478817|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I read it the first time in one sitting.  How Green manages to write a book about this difficult of a subject and not cliche the hell out of it is amazing in itself.  Most books/movies with the same plot allow for a certain amount of fake heroism for the characters.  Don't get me wrong, anyone who is battling cancer or any life altering disease is a hero in my book.  However, it's almost like writers have to write the characters as heroic to make it worth reading for the reader/like they have to give back control to the characters in the face of illness.  Green manages to capture chaos of trying to live a life with death looming over the characters and treat it in a real manner which at times is devoid of any heroism.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have seen from other readers is regarding the intelligence level of the characters.  However, the idea that teenagers aren't intelligent or don't have extensive vocabulary skills is ridiculous.<br /><br />The part where Hazel describes the smaller infinities created by their relationship made 50% cry and 50% jealous to not have found  that relationship.  I highly recommend this book.  Any worries you have about not reading about cancer, or not wanting to read a sob story...push them aside.  This is not really a book about cancer, cancer is just a side affect of incredible story.
0316228532|3.0|This book is very well written. JK does not disappoint with her incredible descriptive writing. The imagery created while reading this book was the best I have ever experienced, along with the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />I know I am a huger JK fan, but I think I may just not be a big fan of contemporary non-fiction. So my review is probably not fair. I love dystopian, fantasy and sci-fi, so this book was a little out of my element. But, I wanted to read it because I love how JK writes.<br /><br />The problem was, to me, nothing really happened. It was like a day time soap opera in a book. It tells a bunch of small stories about all the different people in the town, but nothing really comes together. I think I just prefer a main character or a few characters that I can cheer for and relate with in a book. There was just too much going on for me, personally.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Best book ever. Really great. Not as good as the first but can't wait for the third coming out in December!
B008SVS3FC|5.0|John Hiatt has done it again, which, to those who follow him, should come as no surprise.  Pretty much since \\"Bring the Family,\\" Mr. Hiatt has been delivering fun, relate-able, and sometimes dark songs, with his quirky sense of humor.  This album has everything from a bluesy lament of the modern age (\\"Blues Can't Even Find Me\\"), a brush with masochism (\\"Bite Marks\\"), rockers about motorcycle accidents (\\"It All Comes Back Someday\\"), and a promise that it all will end in tears (\\"I Know How to Lose You\\").  At the very least, I love the way Hiatt says \\"Funyuns\\" in \\"Wood Chipper.\\"  Pop it in your car, and you'll end up driving around the block a couple of times, just so you can finish it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follet maintains his fine reputation as a fictional writer in historic settings with Winter of the World. Set during the mid-1930s through WWII this is a book that will draw you in and provide educational insights of this turbulent time in history.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely not a put down kind of book.<br />Wonderful story proving  how strong love can be. Couldn't put the book down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all 3 books.  the ending was good but not what i predicted.  i'm sorry this is the last book.  looking forward to the last 2 books being made into movies.
B00005N6KG|4.0|model ordered is what I got and it came quickly but unsure if they are clean as they where handled and put in a plastic bag that was not sealed. my guess these where considered 2nds and where acquired in bulk and then sold on e bay a little sneaky!! but they work!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because once I  started reading it I couldn't stop.  The ending was quick and disappointing. It left me sad and unresolved .
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|first i saw review show 4 to 5 stars.. so i try it for free apps of the day... and oh my god.. i love this game!!!<br /><br />Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G<br />android 4.0.4
B008F5QQI2|4.0|White light is a reasonably good dance track.  His vocals continue to be strong and he remains one of the great pop vocalists of all time. I'm not particularly excited by the other tracks on this EP - the other edits of White Light don't add a lot in my opinion, but I'm always interested in anything new George Michael puts out. A word of warning, this does contain explicit lyrics.
159420411X|5.0|Just a truly outstanding book.  Quite possibly the best book I've read in years and certainly one of the most important.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Controlled and manipulation. no one likes to be controlled like a puppet,so when Katniss and Peeta are required to play the Government's    death game, they are able to see thru the subterfuge and win. At least for round  one.
B005K17RU0|1.0|this app only works in portrait orientation with the kfhd camera on the left.  I use a case that requires the camera on the right to work the magnetic on/off.  The case also orients the camera at the top when in landscape mode and the case functioning as a stand.  The camera on top works better for skype.  If you use with a case you'll likely need to hold it upside down or reverse the installation of the device.  i just can't get used to it.  i haven't used the app and can't review it further because i can't get passed the orientation issue.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Finally, an M:I movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. Although the premise is not a humorous one (global destruction), the movie itself and the cast seem more lighthearted thus making it less dark and serious. Simon Pegg pretty much gives any movie he's in a shot in the arm, and Jeremy Renner's acting chops fit in well with the rest of the cast.Sorry we didn't get to see Ving until the end, though. All in all a pretty good flick and the blu ray looks pretty freaking awesome ( especially the shots of Dubai).
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!! Make sure you download the right one - it should be free.  I wish it had a few short cuffs to pin faster like you can on the iphone.
B00321SMI6|5.0|I like watching programs that keep me interested. Mission accomplished. Also found out a few things I did not know existed like 100 lbs salamanders.
1451696191|5.0|I read a lot of books, and every now and then I stumble upon one which leaves me feeling as though something I never knew about had been missing previously to reading that book.  This is one such novel.  The Perks of Being a Wallflower is exceedingly excellent, and I genuinely wish that I had read it whilst in high school.  Throughout the book, Charlie is faced with a wide array of issues that everyone at some point stumble upon, and faces them in a very real and honest way.  It seems that often young-adult books about high school and coming of age have a very condescending tone, but Charlie is relateable and endearing.  All around, this was an excellent read.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|really helps me go to sleep when it is really hard to and I recommend. this to people who want to meditate or need to go to sleep
0316228532|1.0|Same detailed character development as the Potter series, but very poor plot development.  And I became seriously tired of reading about highly dysfunctional families.  Not an enjoyable book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love the story line makes the game interesting! Keeps me playing to see what comes next :) a game I can enjoy with my children!
B007SGM084|5.0|I am on chapter 12 of the second book and i love it. The book isn't what i expected it to be. There is a story behind it and it really is a page turner. I would recommend this book to everyone. Be open minded it's not just about one thing.
B008XG1X18|4.0|My absolute favorite app... I'm on it daily!  I just wish photos would load faster on Kindle Fire... other than that it 's a fab app!  Love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a must read for women. This book will bring the 'spark' back into your marriage.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I immediately was able to find where I wanted to start reading because of the Table of Contents and it is so nice to have it come back to the exact chapter that I left off reading.  I enjoy this translation of the Bible and the voice of the reader is very pleasant.  I had no idea when I got this app that it had a reader, so it was a pleasant surprise.  [[ASIN:B004MC8CA2 Bible]]
0440242401|4.0|A delightful \\"chick flick\\" of a book about a young woman who suffers amnesia after an accident, and finds herself in what at first appears to be a dream life, but then finds out that things aren't as good as they at first appeared and she needs to find her way back to her real self.  A quick, light, fun read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Does what it says. When you want to know the forecast for the day and week ahead, and get it quick, this is the app! No frills, but I wasn't looking for frills anyway.
B005FNGAD8|5.0|No collection of music is complete without this powerful album. The music within puts Mr. Joel's piano talents on full display.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Does its job. The default font size is too small, and although there is a setting to fix that, the setting does not seem to apply to all parts of the interface (for example, replies to a tweet).
B008RV5K5E|1.0|Just saw this movie and it was quite terrible.  If you value an hour of your time and want to discourage lazy film-making skip this movie!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book isn't exactly for adults. Teens could read it & learn from it. I wouldn't recommend anyone pay what I paid for it on kindle, that's for sure!!
0871404133|5.0|The Social Conquest of Earth is one of those books that teaches a great deal and encourages deep thinking. What is especially wonderful is Wilson's weaving together the biology, ecology, and cultural elements of social evolution. He is careful to describe the level of evidence available for his hypotheses about the importance of group natural selection. Thank goodness we don't have to rely on the pseudo-religious banter of Richard Dawkins and his selfish gene minions for good science! I highly recommend this book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun! I don't play a million times a day, but it is fun to play a few times a day. :)
0316228532|1.0|So sorry to see that she has fallen for the F___ word.  I detest that word and it's use, multiple times, in the first chapter has encouraged me to throw the book in the garbage.  I will never buy another foul language book by Rowling as I am extremely sorry I wasted money on this trash.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is awesome!  We can't wait for the next one to come out!  There is a lot of excitement and adventure for the heroes.
B007H1HQW0|4.0|Love this product. It made it very easy to cut the bottoms off wine bottles. I would probably still be here breaking bottles if it wasn't for this glass cutter.
B006QF7664|1.0|Good sf movies are few and far between. So are horror movies. Good horror sf movies are even more rare. Sorry but Apollo 18 was not a good sf or horror for me.<br /><br />Spoiler:<br />The basic theme seems sound: There was a mission after 17 which went to the moon and discovered Russian cosmonauts had been there as well as a \\"menace\\" which had killed the Russians and contaminated one of our astronauts. This we know from secret film which was edited to make the movie.<br /><br />Supposedly degraded film and shaking the camera do not make a good horror movie or sf movie. This film is a big bust so don't waste your money or your time. The trailer was better than the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Not so much for the sex part of it but everytime i put it down i wondered what was going to happen next.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|I love this band and their music! I will continue to buy every album they put out! Awesome sound, great production. Must have!!
B008D28HYS|4.0|this game is so awesome it really hard when your colorblind ... i got this game when it was the &quot;app of the day&quot; so i already had the non color version so i thought why not its free it i was so glad i did that but i also am very pleased that you constantly update it and one thong that you could make is a colorblind version that would be awesome....... thanks
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book and suzzane put so much detail in the beginning and middle but i thought she summarized it in the end i thought that she could have given more detail in the end after all it is the last book i would recommend this book to someone who likes a good  violent adventure like book and i think it was a great book
B007JM4CWY|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME IM GETTING BETTER BY THE MINUTE BUT COLOR PRESENTS A REAL CHALLENGE BUT CAN YOU MAKE A VERSION FOR COLOR BLIND PEOPLE THATS IN COLOR THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANKS ......
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is just as captivating as the 1st. I cannot wait for the next book in the series.   WOW!!
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Movie was great but couldnt stand the black spaces at the top and bottom of the screen.<br />So I returned it.<br />When they can make it fill the whole screen I would gladly buy it again
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is just about as accurate as my other weather apps....which means that they usually agree within a couple degrees, and then are all wrong.  ;)
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is great... love the ongoing game version! nice to be able to earn money overnight as a real city does.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I waited a long time for this book and now that I am finished, I sincerely hope that I don't have to wait as long for the next - please!  It took me about one chapter until all the characters came back to life for me.  Thank you Ken Follett.
B007XCH150|5.0|in 1987 when I were 19, I bought this album and fall in love with it immediatly.<br />it's amaing when I first heard \\"Naugjty Girls Need Love too\\".<br />the beats so uptempo in that time and Sam did a very great job.<br />Get this album, if you were 80's kids.
B00881VLCE|5.0|these puzzles have great graphics. its free for many of the puzzles and you can have 200 piece puzzles.<br />what can go wrong?! nothing! they have all sorts of different themed puzzles. I recommend it for all ages. I love playing puzzles but I hate having to put them back away. so I found this app free and fell right in love. enjoy and relax while playing puzzle. :)
B001AQIYJC|3.0|Loved the movie until the end...that was just wrong! It was a good story to follow but really left me disappointed in the end.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|it's a great game with matching and a storyline and object placement. good graphics and fun sounds and nice pause and return features
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Good plot with unexpected twists.  Wish I had the time and intellectual energy to try out some of the mathematical exercises in the book (is that what the author was counting on, lazy people like me?) but the idea is fun to contemplate.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Soo good! Can't wait until next year. I defiantly did not expect the ending. Can't wait to see the Romans' and Greeks' reaction to it.
B009GEGW62|5.0|Season Seven left me holding my breath when I saw that Barney and Robin were about to get married; I had been waiting in anticipation for season eight, and it has not disappointed thus far. It's still as smart and funny as it's always been. I think my favorite thing about the show is it stays pretty light with \\"just enough\\" drama at times. It never leaves me feeling sad like some shows do, even when the characters go through their breakups, the writers still manage to keep it from being devastating. For example, I didn't like seeing Robin and Ted break up, but when Robin and Barney hooked up, I was all for it. I can't wait to see how the story of how they ended up engaged unfolds. I definitely recommend How I Met Your Mother for anyone who loves a good laugh, and can enjoy watching a group of friends live their lives in a hilarious way.

B0058DRUV6|5.0|This book is Leader's Read for Visionaries World Wide and it delivers a very organized and through approach to discovering your personal as well as any company's economic denominator.  Collins is insightful and detailed.  This is a book you read with a pencil or a highlighter, for sure.  It is an excellent source for discourse if you are mentoring entrepreneurs.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't very often write reviews for anything - but I was particularly impressed with this book, so wanted to give this indie author credit where credit is due!

B007THA4FI|5.0|Was very interested to see how JK Rowling would handle an adult book and was not disappointed. The characters were intricately drawn and captured your interest.  The twists and turns kept you wanting more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great series. Suzanne Collins has done a fine job capturing the the odds being ever in her favor!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this series! I was unable to put this book down. The characters are all so wonderful and it's fun to see them all together on this journey. If you haven't started the series wait until they are all out otherwise you will be left anxious for the next book. Enjoy!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is very graphic & was very difficult to read because of that. It was very intense & kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters are so real! They moved me emotionally & I became very involved with them. Reading this made me anxious & I didn't want to put the book down, staying up late to finish it. As another reviewer stated, I also went back & re-read the beginning of the book. If I had to do it over again, would I read it? I don't know. It was too real.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice graphics and has a nice mix of match 3 challenges. Well crafted and the voice work is pretty good for a mobile game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is exciting and it shows that the real Heroes of this story are the men who carried it out, not the President who takes all the glory...shame on him. This book is apolitical but one can't help feel the pride in these brave souls and the distaste I have with the politicians that have tried to make it their story. Everyone should read this story.
0316228532|4.0|Just because everything has been said about a book doesn't mean more can't be said, right? The first I'd say (though certainly not the first to say it), looking at the number of reviews it has prompted in record time, is that if it weren't for this author, there wouldn't be that many. But neither would there be this well-rounded, engaging, fine story. So the standard for me was: Would there have been just \\"fine\\" shrugs, or more, with another, less-famous writer? Was J.K. Rowling under a particular obligation to write a better-than-fine book? If you've read even one of her--here goes, I can't not mention it--Harry Potter books, you've already pre-formed an opinion. I've only read the first, and I thought this was better.<br /><br />Better, but not fantastic, and certainly not fantastical: J.K. Rowling picked subject matters that scream \\"adult material,\\" insofar I'm with the critics. With her single-mindedness, I suspect she could have written in any number of genres. Instead she did some homework and hinged her big-people- book on small-town politics and socio-economic disaster. She spins more interesting stories than the premise might suggest, and gives the plethora of characters its due, in that each and every one is treated with distinction, all connections compute and mostly convince. Nothing to sneeze at in itself.<br /><br />A personal peeve: The mimicked speech patterns of Krystal Weedon, the character more tragic than deceased council Barry Fairweather who caused the titled Casual Vacancy, grated after a short while, and she gets lots of coverage. Prolonged use of vernacular has caused me to set aside greater books than this one, where Krystal and her folk talk only in \\"yeh,\\" \\"shurrup,\\" and \\"f@%&in'\\"s, every third word or so. I get it: She's underclass. It's described minutely in non-dialogue detail, not all of which I'm sure I needed.<br /><br />But WHY NOT? Because it's unpleasant? It's gross? The people are repelling and so far down that we don't feel likeanalyzing to what measure it's by choice or circumstance. If one of the characters close to Krystal had been more appetizing, he might have met a better fate; another, upperclass character admits so much. So WHY NOT show it? Sure, it's a bit much for basically saying that beneath a picturesque surface, there often lays ugliness. Is someone like J.K. Rowling remotely authenticated (a point of pondering for another character) to write about abjection?<br /><br />Any good writer can write about anything. There are other, private tragedies that, compared to Krystal's, seem like luxury problems, yet they move every bit as much, if not more, for their accessibility. The account of the bullying of a girl is delicately brutal, and a matron's obsession with a boy-band while yearning for lost love, looks and youth makes us laugh and cry with, not at, her. The author knows when to apply lighter touches, and how to sustain a scene, though--my advice, Ms. Rowling, which you must be waiting for: Sex scenes are not your forte.
B002S8AGZG|2.0|So, after much hesitation, I finally saw this film. I get that this takes Taming of the Shrew and makes into a modern day coming-of-age story. That was a reasonable premise. However, you take this talented cast and fabulous director and waste them on just another mediocre coming-of-age tale where the characters are so under-developed that you really don't care whether they come of age on not. Add to that a forced over-sexed twist to try to be hip and the result is huge loss of opportunity. There are moments, but overall, a stark disappointment when contrasted with the potential from source material and the talent on this film. I might be kinder if the source material weren't so great or the talent so strong. Really could have been bright dialog and clever interaction.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|lots of fun if you like bejewled type of games because that is what you'll be doing mostly. fun pass time game

B004EPYZUI|1.0|This movie is appropriately named, because I felt like a sucker after watching it.  It was clearly made to bring in the male geek audience with its video game-like fantasy/action and scantily-clad actresses. But as a geeky girl, I was going to overlook the latter in hopes for some substance in the film. Unfortunately, there was no plot or character development and the \\"dance\\" that she does repeatedly before going into her fantasy world is probably the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Overall, it's a visually striking but horrid film. Only watch it if you have some time and some brain cells to kill (or if you've misplaced your hallucinogen of choice).

0316228532|5.0|This first adult novel of J. K. Rowling has a Jane Austen-ish tone to it, in how it lays out the land, but that's where the similarity ends. Ms. Rowling sliced open all the souls to the core, revealing all of their weak and ugly sides to the degree that there's \\"no place to hide\\". She painted the pictures so clearly, not to mention deftly, sneaking up on you, that when outrage finally pours out it can afford to do so without any doubt or apology.<br /><br />I am one of those people who entered Potterverse with skepticism, but got completely enchanted soon enough, precisely because of the psycho-social issues it addressed, and never looked back. Childhood is indeed magical! It felt crisp with innocence, fun and wits, even in the midst of fighting the worst evil of all times. Ms. Rowling's witty ways hasn't faltered; it's just that there can be only so much crispness in the world of raw adult reality! I agree with a comment here that she was addressing much the same issues in HP, but with the window-dressing of fantasy and the restriction of children's literature.<br /><br />Real life is worse. Dying is almost too easy. In real life, Krystal would not have the escape route of lethal dose handy, she would go to jail instead, be subjected to further violence, and perpetuate the generational curse. And the little boy, if he lived on, would develop so much pathological behavior that his own people would not know how to live around him anymore. And cutters don't have such graceful transition. I know, because I've been working with these populations for couple of decades, and because I've lived through various socio-economic classes. The brief presence of Barry Fairbrother shows what \\"could've been\\", if the \\"adults\\" of the world had really grown up.<br /><br />Some adults in this novel are good and efficient at workplace, such as the doctor and the social worker, but they are practically clueless in their personal lives, leading to their bit of contribution in the confusingsocial mix. The way all the adults are prancing around, making wrong guesses about who attacked them, is so pitiful that there's no way to take a fresher look at it but by laughing about it, and there lies the dark comedy. Of course, the end result of it all is tragic, but it's not the romantic tragedy one traditionally associates with \\"tragedy\\" category in literature.<br /><br />Some comments called Terri a pathetic excuse for a human being. Some comments called some of the characters as stereotyping. I commend the author for getting her clinical facts uncannily accurate. There's no help in \\"stereotyping\\", it is what it is, the old cliché still stands, and there's no room for using imagination to make it more palatable, to come up with alternative brilliant explanation, or make the outcome rosier, if one is to look the hard, cold truth in the face.<br /><br />It's not a cozy read, it doesn't generate a fuzzy warm feeling, rather it revolts, makes one think, and possibly inspires to take action! I could not tell if that's the reaction author was going for, but if so, she definitely succeeded. I don't know what type of reception Grapes of Wrath got when it first came out, but eventually it got recognition as a classic. The Casual Vacancy has such potential. If we, as human race, made the world a better place already, then Ms. Rowling (and such other authors) would not need to write such pieces.

1423136802|5.0|I am a huge Harry Potter Fan and after reading that series over for what seemed like the millionth time, I needed something new to read in the same neighborhood as Harry Potter.  I found great reviews for the Percy Jackson series so I chose to give them a try.  They did not disappoint.  I could not put them down!  They have a great story line, action, adventure, mythology, and make you want to continue reading them over and over!
B008PE9GSA|5.0|It's been nine years since the famous Texas trio released an album of original material, but even longer since they released a good one.  In fact I'd have to go back to 1994 to find what I consider to be their last good album in Antenna. So after being lost in the wilderness for nearly two decades, relying on touring and repackaged greatest hits collections a-la Kiss, La Futura is a release that could be either a comeback album or yet another in the line of recent lack lustre releases to confirm their irrelevance today.<br /><br />This time around they have turned to the well reputed producer Rick Rubin and the American Recordings label.  Rubin is the man largely responsible for reviving the fortunes of country rock legend Johnny Cash towards the end of his career and introducing him to a whole new (and much younger) audience. Has he done the same with ZZ Top?  Well time will tell, but he has definitely put the band back on the right path with La Futura.  The album title is more than just a name.  It's a statement, the Spanish words linking the music of their early days with the direction ahead, and it sums this album up perfectly.  If you are hoping for a return to Eliminator - Afterburner - Recycler era ZZ Top then you may well be disappointed.  La Futura has more in common with ZZ Top's First Album to Deguello era, but this is the ZZ Top I wanna hear.  It's the kind of album I've waited far too long for (I had actually given up on them), and the kind of music I want from them in the future.<br /><br />The opening song I Gotsta Get Paid sets the tone of what's to come.  Right away it's clear that Billy Gibbons is persisting with the fuzzy guitar tone that's been his preference since the Rythmeen album, but whether it's better production or just that the tone has been fuzzed back a little, I'm actually ok with it on this album.  The song also lets the listener know what they're in for in terms of the style too.  It's blues, blues, blues (although this song does have an almost rap type style of singing during the verse).  Yes it's repetitive but damn funky and cool nonetheless.<br /><br />The rest of the album continues from start to finish with various forms of the southern blues boogie rock that they cut their teeth with, and it's all good.  Chartreuse reminds of Tush and the following song Consumption initially had me thinking it was the same song changing style as the riff is extremely similar, just slower and bluesier.  Over You and It's Too Easy Manana are slow blues to savour.  Heartache In Blue is straight blues rocking brilliance with a very welcome and substantial dose of harmonica.  I Don't Wanna Lose, Lose You is a good rocker and probably the closest thing on here to Eliminator and Afterburner.  Flyin' High is a straight ahead rocker in more of an AC/DC kind of blues rock way.  Big Shiny Nine also reminds a bit of Eliminator and closing the album is a funky slow bluesy song Have A Little Mercy.<br /><br />Billy Gibbons sounds to be singing more gravelly these days and could never be considered a great singer, but despite that I still find his voice enjoyable because of the character and coolness it has.  As a guitar player he is one of my favourites and this album is another great example of why.  Cool rocking riffs, sublime solos, a dose of slide, and all the while the blues shining through.<br /><br />Rather interestingly they have released another version of this album, but it is very hard to come by.  The regular album I have described above is available through all the regular music stores (including on-line), but the other version is only available through \\"Best Buy\\" (whoever/whatever they are), something I never knew before picking up my version.  The difference is that the Best Buy version has two extra songs and I think they should have been on the album proper.  Why they have done this I don't know, but my only criticism with the regular album is that it is just a little too short and so these extra songs fill it out nicely.  But not only do they give the album the length it deserves; they are two of the best songs!  Threshold Of A Breakdown is a cool bluesy rocker that has a little Eliminator shining through, as does Drive By Lover which is the only song on La Futura where Dusty Hill sings lead vocals.  Luckily I have since been able to obtain these two songs or else I would have been severely disappointed.<br /><br />So a big thanks from me to Rick Rubin for getting these guys back on track again with an album that I am enjoying very much.  I just hope the masses agree with me and we get more like this in the future.<br /><br />Preferred Tracks:<br />Chartreuse, Heartache In Blue, I Don't Wanna Lose Lose You, Flyin' High, It's Too Easy Manana, plus the two extra tracks Threshold Of A Breakdown & Drive By Lover.s fill it out nicely.  But not only do they give the album the length it deserves; they are two of the best songs!

Couple that with a ton of 'all the news that never get printed': interesting facts from history about how and why our current (albeit 1972) set of circumstances comes to be, and you have Sugar Blues.

0385737955|3.0|My YA librarians have been talking this series up.  I am a 30-something woman who enjoys Young Adult sci-fi/fantasy/dystopian novels.  They thought I'd love this one.  Um, sorry....not really.  It begins in such a confusing, disjointed manner....and I get it:  Thomas is confused and disjointed.  But still...!!  And the author just doesn't give any good solid answers.  After awhile, the interest and suspense start to fade; the constant killing off of named-but-unimportant characters becomes tiresome and unnecessarily gruesome.  And then you get to the end and it's like one big \\"Haha, RESET!\\"  And as much as I'd like to chuck it and forget the series, I can't because I've already committed and I have to finish the whole stinking thing.  The premise was good; I wish more with the maze and the history of the Gladers was fleshed out a bit.  Kudos to Dashner for creating a new slang, though I did feel like I was reading the words \\"shuck\\" or \\"klunk\\" 10x a paragraph.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This has been hands down my favorite Big Fish Hidden Objects Game (HOG) that I have played yet.  The hidden object screens were great - no problem viewing them on my Kindle Fire.  They were challenging enough so that I had to really search for some of the items, but not so hard that I was using the &quot;Hint&quot; button constantly.  The storyline was excellent! I ended up playing in a dark room just to make it that much creepier, not that it really needed it.  I would highly recommend this game!! I wouldn't really recommend it to younger children, however, because it does have some violence in the storyline.(Dont want to give any spoilers, so I'm just gonna leave it like that.  Cant wait to see (and even more play!!!) the next game in this series.  I'm hoping that Part 2 is as good as this one. LOVED it!!!!
0385738765|2.0|I am a 30-something woman who enjoys reading Young Adult dystopian/sci-fi/fantasy novels.  My local YA librarians have been talking this series up as something that I'd *love.*  Um, sorry...but no.  The Maze Runner was okay, not great.  It started with a good premise, but lacked fleshing out.  The overused, made-up slang -- and the suspense & gore -- were irritating as the novel progressed.  But any-hoo, this review is for THE SCORCH TRIALS.  Second verse, same as the first.  Well, not really because I think Book 2 was not as good as Book 1.<br />A simple summary:<br />1. WICKED:  \\"Haha, punked you.  Reset, do-over, but TOUGHER!\\"<br />2. Gladers:  Hot desert, walk, walk, walk.  LIGHTNING!!!  Walk, walk, walk.  ZOMBIES!!!  Walk, walk, walk.  BETRAYAL, oh the pain!<br />3. Thomas:  I'm not a leader.  I'm a leader.  Theresa?  Brenda?  I'm confused!  I'm angry!  My feelings are hurt!<br />4. WICKED:  \\"Haha, you made it to the safe haven, but we tricked you!  More lightning!  More bio-creatures!  Just wait and see what we have in store!\\"<br />5.  James Dashner:  \\"Oh yeah, hehe, tricked you again.  Read Book 3.\\"<br /><br />Seriously, though.... the one main thing that bothered me was the pitting of Group A vs. Group B.  Both groups of kids had been manipulated and tortured and abused at the hands of the same group.  And now, one of those groups is willing to harm the other because the abusers told them to...in exchange for their freedom/cure?  And they believe them, after all the lies....really?!?

1423140605|5.0|Mark of Athena starts off after the events of The Son of Neptune. Annabeth, Jason, Piper, and Leo sailed off to the roman camp to find Percy and the other two demigods that will complete there team on fulfilling the prophecy. The plot takes off from there.<br />I don't want to give away any spoilers for this book so this will be a non-spoiler review, but there will be spoilers from the first two books in the Heroes of Olympus series and some from the original Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.<br /> The pace of this book is very good as it always is in Rick Riordan's books. Every event in the book is crucial and important to the plot of the book. There is a lot of action and adventurous parts of the book that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I've always loved the writing style of Rick Riordan because he doesn't use big words that you don't understand, he may use some but he wants you to learn.<br />Almost all the characters in this book are familiar to you. We have Percy and Annabeth from the original series and then we have Jason, Piper, Leo, Hazel, Frank, and Coach Hedge. Even though Coach Hedge is not one of the seven demigods on the quest, he insisted on chaperoning the quest. Percy is of course as funny as ever with his witty dialogue and funny actions. Though he fools around sometimes, he still takes things seriously when the time comes to be responsible and brave.<br />Annabeth is now my favorite character. This is really and truly Annabeth's story as Rick Riordan said it was. It follows her journey in finding the Mark of Athena. She is so brave in facing her own fears. She is also brilliant which always comes in handy. Jason to me proves him worthy in this book. At first, I never really liked Jason. In this book he seems more brave and smart. He serves as a very important character in the quest. So does Piper. In this book she begins to stop thinking that shes helpless. Her charm-speak is really what makes the difference in the plot. Leo is always funny and cracks a joke throughout the whole book. Leo, Hazel, and Franks stories intertwine because Leo looks exactly like Sam from Hazel's past. Throughout the book though Hazel and Frank are suspicious, but both still focus on the quest. Coach Hedge of course acts like a chaperone from ruining late nights to grounding them and setting curfew.<br />Rick Riordan keeps you guessing throughout the book with twists and turns that are MIND BLOWING! The ending is so heart breaking and cliffhanging that you would do anything to get the next book in advance. Rick Riordan I solemly swear that I am going to get your next book before anyone else!! This book is of coarse 5 out of 5 stars! Due to how good this book is, I may post a discussion about Mark of Athena that will have spoilers in every paragraph. Thanks for reading and keep viewing!

B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is really great. I thought id never use it, but I cant go a day without looking anymore. the general controls were odd and confusing but I figured it out and now I loooove it!!! the crafts and diy are my fave categories!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book captivates your attention leaving you wanting for more.... more of Mr Grey...more of the vivid intimate love making scenes...more of the highs and the lows of Fifty Shades....
B004UNX1LS|2.0|this app is annoying I cant even listen to music I doesn't load it doesn't do anything but tuck up. I would rather pay 500$ to go to a concert and listen to music the tuck around with this pathetic app dont get it sucks d#$&amp;
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. Hope they come out with another soon<br />Watching it on Amazon while traveling is a bonus.  Will be watching more!
B008BRC7BE|5.0|Ian Gillan and  Tony Iommi collaborate on old and new music for charity. A great view of two great musicians through their careers as they perform within the genre of hard rock/heavy metal. They also bring a variety of other types of music to show the well rounded talents of two rock giants. Enjoy the expected and unexpected of rock royalty.
B004TTHLBE|1.0|I've been reading the genre as well as world mythologies and stories with gusto my whole life, and cannot recall the last time I've been unable and unwilling to finish a book.  It was beyond a disappointment, it was a frustration which even months later upsets me.  It was boring, unenlightening, dismal, dreary, depressing, and pointless. Though the idea is great, it went nowhere.

B009L6UDUG|5.0|This is the review for Tomorrow Never Dies Blu-ray Release (available exclusively at Target for $15, or included in the Bond 50 box set everywhere).<br /><br />I'll skip the movie, you probably know if you like the movie or not. This is a Bond film with a lot of actions, and this blu-ray release does not disappoint.<br /><br />The Disc:<br />This disc has no trailer, it leads directly to a menu that looks the same as the previously released James Bond Blu-rays (except Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace). When the movie starts, it starts with a newly designed United Artist logo and also a different music accompanying that logo instead of the old one seen in the Special Edition DVD (the 50th Anniversary Goldeneye Blu-ray release starts with the new logo too but the music accompanying that logo is the same as before), after that its the movie you knew before.<br /><br />Video:<br />Tomorrow Never Dies has never looked this good, ever! From the first frame it blew my mind! I see details I never saw on the DVD (for example in the pre-title sequence Bond puts a small explosive on the rocket on the back of a moving truck, I actually saw the small explosive's red light flashing instead of just hearing the beep beep sound) The outdoor scenes look natural and the scenes on the stealth boat has a cold tint to it that sets the mood but isnt distracting. If you own \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" on blu-ray from before, \\"Tomorrow\\" looks way sharper than \\"World\\", the contrast level is better and the characters and objects in the movie pops out more from the background.<br /><br />Audio:<br />Tomorrow Never Dies gets the standard DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound track like all 22 Bond films in the Bond 50 set. This lives up to everything you can expect from an action-packed film. Every gunshot pops, every explosions rumbles the subwoofer, and you can hear bullets flying around you all the time. Again comparing to \\"The World Is Not Enough\\", this sound track is far superior, it sounds cleaner and more distinctive between the many different sounds in the scenes.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like this movie, this is the perfect way to experience it again in its most perfect form yet.
0470901071|5.0|I used Todd's CCNA 7th Edition book to pass the CCNA with a score of 960. This book is a must read if you're planning on taking the CCNA. Read this cover to cover and go through as many practice labs and practice tests as possible and you will pass the exam.  Todd's chapters on subnetting are by far the best out there. Being able to subnet in your head really gives you that confidence needed to pass this very difficult exam. Todd explains how to subnet better than any method I've seen. I also purchased Todd's CCNA IOS commands Survival guide and that helped with practicing the labs. I highly recommend both books!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Easy read. If you liked 50 Shades of Grey you'll like this! You need to read the first one to appreciate the story between the characters.
B000002C4J|1.0|Unable to deal with the horrifying possibility of accidentally hearing another cd as bad as this one, I have just finished tearing my ears out with my bare hands.

B0072OFM28|5.0|liam mcintyre does not disappoint in this sequel.It has every bit of action and suspence as the previous episodes.Can't wait for next season!
B007V508CC|2.0|there's a certain glossy sheen, a sense of overcooked and overproduced top 40 schlock that defines the music of Maroon 5. Yeah, Moves Like Jagger was cute, but mainstream Top 40 drivel makes my ears bleed.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I haven't tried any games from this company before, but I really enjoy the puzzles and am quite addicted to playing.
B0050VI5SI|4.0|Great music to jam out to before going out or while in the car. The lyrics are refreshing and not as full of self pity as opposed to a lot of music that's big right now, or that I ususally listen to haha. Just fun music.
B0027BVMSY|4.0|I am a James bond fan. Quantum of Solace was a bit hard to follow at first. But enjoyable. Video quality was excellent. Wish I had known about amazon video sooner.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another great hot intense read by Sylvia Day. It keeps you reading and wanting more. Once you start reading you can't stop until your done but you should read Bared to You first, you will understand more. I can't wait until the next one comes out, I already pre-ordered it. I read 50 Shades of Grey and this comes real close.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|just started playing flow free; really enjoying it so far. its challenging without being frustrating. happy to recommend it. I usually play solitaire but this has replaced that!

B004LTA9MK|5.0|I have heard a bootleg of this show many years ago and it was about a 6 out of 10. This one has great sound and is filled with some great songs, most notably War/No More Trouble. There is a huge jam on No Woman No Cry making it a 6:05 length tune. From there it is like a bolder rolling down hill with the classic Marley songs Jamming, Exodus, Redemption Song and finishing with Could You Be Loved. For fans this historic show has a level of sadness as you listen knowing it was the last he would ever sing. His music stand up to time well. I will be honest and say I did buy this for the t-shirt and did not expect much from the recording but was pleasantly surprised. I have had many compliments on the shirt.
B008XG1X18|3.0|my friend showed me this and i had no idea i was to have an account, but you have too i didn't know at all. so i tried to sing up an account but it took FOREVER. the reason im giving this a few stars is because i love the stuff that they come up with. ;)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm a big Ken Follett fan so lets get that bias out of the way.  I read the first entry into this series and thought it was pretty good.  Not Pillars of the Earth good but well worth the read.  I think the second book is much better!  It is faster paced and I care more about the people in the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm obsessed with the hunger games. I can't wait when catching fire comes out on the movie screen next year!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Similar to the bejeweled game but with a mission and a story. I can't stop playing. Works great on the HTC Hero.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Really the book is awesome,,,but there is one seriously negative point,,,its that after you finish reading the book you end up wishing(or rather begging)for more..I know it is suppose to happen like that to prepare a good base for the next book in the series,,but i wish Rick release them sooner cuz it breaks my heart when i think that i have to wait one full year before the next book.<br />But apart from that it is an awesome read.I love the fact that the story in the new series is getting much more mature(like the seriousness of  the relationship between Annabeth and Percy) as the fan base of the series.Hope to see more romance(including possessiveness,problems,,etc) between Annabeth and Percy in the next book.Enjoy.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I Love the Fifty Shades of Grey Classical Album. I listen to it when I'm in the car and while I'm working on my computer.

B008I34ZG6|5.0|&#34;Over-nite Sensation&#34; was the first Zappa album I ever heard all the way through. I was about 12 years old, and it really hit home. Because of this album I've managed to collect virtually everything Frank Zappa released. More often than not I've truly enjoyed everything Frank released. &#34;Over-nite Sensation&#34; remains one of my many favorite Zappa albums. It did appeal to me as a 12 year old boy, especially the &#34;naughty&#34; lyrics in &#34;Dirty Love&#34; and &#34;Dinah-Moe Humm&#34;. The silliness of raising a crop of dental floss in the song &#34;Montana&#34; tickled my funny bone. The music on this album is best described as rock with a hint of jazz-fusion. This was also my introduction to jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, who plays the amazing solo on &#34;Fifty-Fifty&#34;. When I first got this album, I decided that I needed more Frank Zappa. I also decided that Frank was one hell of a lead guitar player. It's almost 40 years later, and the music of Frank Zappa remains one of my favorite ways to pass the time. The man's catalog is chock full of various styles of music. A Zappa album can be classical (&#34;Orchestral Favorites&#34;), balls to the wall rock (&#34;Zoot Allures&#34;), jazz-fusion (&#34;Waka/Jawaka&#34;) or any combination there-in. I'm forever grateful to my sister's friend Pete who brought &#34;Over-nite Sensation&#34; to our house that one day. If not for that day, I may not have ever learned about Frank. &#34;Over-nite Sensation&#34; was my introduction to Frank Zappa. His sense of humor is missed. The world hasn't been the same without him.<br /><br />To fully appreciate just how great this album is, consider this. I often burn CDs to travel with, because I don't like to subject my CD collection to the things that can happen in a vehicle! And in most cases I burn my own compilations. Every time I've tried to compile a Zappa compilation I get to this album and think, &#34;If I put MONTANA and DINAH-MOE HUMM on my compilation disc, I still need to have CAMARILLO BRILLO, I'M THE SLIME and DIRTY LOVE on it as well, as these are very popular FZ songs. Then I think, what about ZOMBY WOOF? That's a great tune, amazing guitar solo, stop on a dime arrangement. Can't do this without ZOMBY WOOF. Then it occurs to me that there's only one track missing, and it's a great one with a mind-blowing Jean-Luc Ponty electric violin solo followed by an insanely fantastic FZ lead guitar solo. Might as well just say to hell with the compilation and just copy OVER-NITE SENSATION for the ride.ed to have CAMARILLO BRILLO, I'M THE SLIME and DIRTY LOVE on it as well, as these are very popular FZ songs.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game as pretty good graphics. The monsters are created to really bring out their true nature and overall the monsters were nicely selected.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I have always loved this movie. Now, as a professor who occasionally teaches a professional selling class the movie is even more poignant. My students can learn a lot from it, good and bad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is such a great website to gather ideas for anything you may be into. I have become the greatest cook and  made the craftiest holiday decor around thanks to pintrest!!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|4 stars because you can't pin anything from other websites unless they have a pin button on their site (not a big deal). This is a great app for viewing others pins and searching pinterest for ideas. Well designed for quick browsing.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What a great video, now I understand why the movie was such a blockbuster hit.  Only watched the 3D version as I anticipated it would look spectacular and it did.
1451627289|5.0|I was so sad to see this book end.  I felt like the characters of Jake and Sadie became friends of mine.<br />I felt like I knew them from birth.<br /><br />I've always been intrigued by the Kennedy Assassination and I've often wondered  WHAT IF  he<br />hadn't been shot.  This book brings you into this world.<br /><br />Its thrilling,  heart breaking,  moving and  filled with Nostalgia that you'll just adore.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like this game. I have played various versions on my desk top and am excited to see it available here.  Have only passed the first part and so far so good. Would recommend.

B008MM9630|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is easy to move along and you can play anywhere. I hope that doesn't change. I was playing different game that started out that way and after update it went to Internet only :-(. So far this game is going well. Having lots of fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|To this day I tell people that I could not put these books down. I read all 3 books in 5 days no kidding!! And I even read them again after I was done because no other book could interest me the way this series has! If you love a good love story with some twists and some erotic scenes that make you look at your boyfriend and wonder why he can`t do that to you then this book is for you. It isn`t just about the erotic scenes but I just fell in love with the characters and think that the story keeps you wanting to read. I would recommend this book to anyone that asks me for a good story that makes you want to grab your covers and lay in bed and explore things that many do not know about and yes I am talking about BDSM.
1589795474|4.0|I read this book from the library after reading the reviews here. Great book. It shows the habits of the true wealthy. I always assumed a lot of really wealthy people wore regular clothes and drove regular cars after I found out years ago that Bill Gates drove a Honda Accord lol.<br /><br />A few quirks-the book mostly talks about being frugal. That's only part of the equation. The other part is INVESTING. Nobody get's rich just from saving. I would've liked if the authors would've researched some of the investment habits of the rich. Furthermore, the authors should've also researched a few regular middle class families to show the differences between these two classes of people/families. A whole chapter was written just to explain that it is detrimental to give adult children regular monetary gifts because it turns them into lazy underachievers. That was overkill in my opinion. The tables were a bit much too. Most of the rich are business owners and a very small percentage work for others. I would've liked if the authors would've researched these rich employees, since most people work for others.<br /><br />Besides those quirks the book is really a great book. It shows that the rich we see on tv and movies and hear singing on the radio are only a small percentage of the wealthy. And most of them aren't really wealthy when you consider their debt and spending habits.  As one other person commented on though, who wants to be rich and drive regular cars, wear regular clothes, etc? Maybe I'm brainwashed by watching all the 'rich' on tv and in movies with all their nice things.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Book was good, has an interesting twist. I thought the character development lacked some, I didn't get as engaged with them as I would like to
B008KL2ITW|5.0|What a breath of fresh air! This book was different in so many ways. The age category was perfect, it took me back to my college days, with all the dynamics of student freedom and independence. I really enjoyed how it was written too; Jamie gets to the point.  It reflected so many REAL emotions of crazy young love and the characters were deep and passionate. I just loved it and think it would make a really good movie, for now Im ready to read it again ;-)
B0043WHRWA|5.0|Season 3 is fantastic! Great storylines and back stories for all the characters. Congrats to Ryan for getting engaged! Best season yet
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book series (short story series?) is one of the best Sci-Fi pieces I have read in years.  I pride myself a Sci-Fi fan that has read a good balance of the classics (Bradbury, Wells, Asimov, Dick, Herbert, Heinlein) and some newer, fun stuff (Card, Bear, King etc.) But I must admit, I am picky with my non-philosophical sci-fi. I rarely enjoy a book that is nothing but adventure, nothing but plot driven action.<br /><br />The Wool Omnibus pack of stories is a very unique mix two of my favorite themes in Sci-Fi: post apocalypse and fabricated societal structures with a story that pulls you along without making you feel guilty about enjoying it so much.  It is an adventurous action mystery with philosophical underpinnings.  The characters are flawed, individual and intrinsically weak. There aren't laser wielding robot armies or a hero that can bend space with his mind.  This is a true Sci-Fi story: one that uses the genre and its structure to show us more about humanity rather than to just play around in the stars and with technology.<br /><br />WOOL is a perfect example of why eBooks are amazing.  This unknown author would NEVER have reached as many people if he could only publish in print.  This is a story that deserves to be told and I am excited to continue to follow.  4 stars because, hey, it isn't \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" or \\"The Road\\" but it is amazing, and for $6?  I dare you to find a better ratio of $ to enjoyment hours.  And if you do, let me know what it is!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I thought this book tried to make a Good Attempt At being close to 50 Shades of Grey.  It was pretty good and a must read I feel before you read 50 Shades of  Greg.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I've played Grisley Manor, Crimson Manor, Lost City, and am playing Enigmatus currently but The Haunt is my favority so far with Lost City coming in as second.  It had a good story to keep me interested, great graphics, and the length was long enough to feel satisfied.  If I remember correctly the developer has a website for the walk-through if I got stuck (I did use it a few times) which is also a plus.  More like this game please.....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book, and am now waiting for the 3rd to come out. It def. leaves you wanting more. I enjoy her writing a lot
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game; no glitches on my kindle fire. check it out! not for the action junkies, but a great time killer.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I watched this movie 5 times. 2 in the theaters, 2 online, and I rented it from Amazon when it was released. I am kind of obsessed with Iron Man so this movie got all 5 for me. It was so good it motivated me to watch Thor and Captain America. I cannot wait until they release the second movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Boy this book was good ...loved it ..thought it was better than fifty shades.Characters are still out of this world but just jaded enough for those of us in the real world to identify with.Cant wait for the third book.
B00190OHD6|4.0|I love how romantic and realistic it was at the same time. It kind of helps people learn how to deal with grief. It also shows that every one deals with grief differently.
B008602KQI|1.0|First let me say, I loved this film. So much so I wanted it for my home collection. Unfortunately, the DVD had a flaw which caused it to freeze up in the middle of a scene, and I was unable to advance the film from that point. I tried this on a several different DVD players (the two on my home TVs, and on 2 different computers) with the same problem each time, so it was not the player. I requested a replacement rather than a refund, but was refunded instead. While there was no problem  returning the item, since I purchased it with points, I lost the points with no replacement, as points are not reinstated with a returned item. Unfortunately, I have now lost both the physical DVD and the points.
B008MM9630|5.0|this game is so cute and a good game to play to help past time and is free!<br /><br />this game is so cute!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love this!!  Rick Riordan knows how to leave you in suspense and dying for the next book.  Only wish some of the characters had more prominent roles, though they may move into the spotlight in House of Hades.  Can't wait until next October!!!
0143119680|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  It kept me intriqued.  I felt like I was transported in time along with the characters in the book.  It was a great escape for a few hours of pleasure.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A few loose ends were tied up in this book.  Just as steamy as book one.  I already pre-ordered book 3!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game. But careful... it's addictive. simple enough for young kids to play. challenging enough for grown-ups. simple game rules with enough variety to keep it interesting.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|This is set in the story telling style of the comic books of the 1960's.  it doesnt waste story time on the fluff of hows and whys but goes immediately into relationship of the three boys and how gaining powers affects them.<br /><br />this movie isnt going to change the industry but its very good, well acted and doesnt insult you by adding pointless plot pieces on top of more pointless visuals. If an action scene needs to be 3 minutes to work, then its 3 minutes, not 10.<br /><br />The story is whats important and the story is what gets told.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is great.  I use it for so many different activities.  Using it to journal my travel experience - using it to store photos and lots of other fun things. A must have app!!!

B0009RCPY8|5.0|Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramus, Rick Moranis, and sigorney weaver. Struck gold with the movie,  Weaver's apartment building was built by a group who had formed an occult. Now, the boys work at a university. Before they're kicked out, since Murray is a scientist, but is really a scam artist. While Akroyd and Ramus are real scientists, being proven at the library. Enter sigorney weaver, a celloist. But her apt is haunted, and since the boys have been kicked out of college, Murray convinces the others that they need to go into business for themselves. A ghosthunting business, their first job is at a hotel. And their job is to capture Slimer, who becomes a character in and of himself. After pretty much trashing the reception room, they finally capture him. And so word spreads, meanwhile weaver begins to experience strange happenings, and calls on the ghostbusters. Murray doesn't really convince her that he's serious, but shows her the research on her building. And come to find out a babylonian god Zool has taken over her apt, unfortunately moranis's apt is part of the takeover too. They're both turned into Dogs, a running joke throughout the movie. The ghostbuster's also get another a member to the team Winston, and just in time to get thrown in jail by the EPA. But after a very funny meeting with the mayor, they're released from jail. Just in time to square off against Zool, And the Stay Pufft marshmellow man. The boys win, Murray gets the girl at the end. And save the city, a very funny movie. A great date movie, also part of this pack is the sequel. I hate to say this, but part two isn't quite as good as the first one, even though all the original actors come back. Even the Titanic makes an appearance, but it still doesn't elevate this movie. It's not terrible, but not great either.
B008MM9630|3.0|Fairy Farm is a really cute game. However,  I have tried making a purchase (4 unicorns, 400 crystal's &amp; 200k coins $9.99) and I was thanked for my order, started receiving the item's,  and the game crashed. I went back in,  and my items weren't there.<br />Amazon was gracious enough to refund my purchase but I really wanted the item's but won't risk it.<br /><br />In addition the avatar selection should have at least four skin tones from fair to brown skin. I feel that I shouldn't have to spend crystal's to get a brown skinned fairy.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Wow, I have to ask those people trashing this movie if they've really read the Spider-Man comic books. Because Peter Parker wasn't a muscle bound superhero, Marvel comics heros were and are primarely Science bound heroes. With alittle bit of action thrown in, and Spider-Man was no exception. He had to fight villains while on the other side of the city his Aunt is in the hospital because of a heart attack. Tobey Mcguire did an awsome job as both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst was okay as Mary Jane. And to disagree with a previous reviewer, this story is straight out of the golden age of Spider-man comics, yes they did change some of the origins. But again, it actually didn't hurt the story. The green Goblin, was alittle weak. Not too much, again to bring Spider-man to the big screen, this was Better than you think it was.
B00007GZQI|5.0|For the uninitiated The Magic Christian is a movie of outrageous fun and satire. It attacks just about every facet of mainstream society with devastating, black humor. Featuring Peter Sellers donning the best pomp accent in modern memory and Ringo Starr in a supporting role. Written by Terry Southern, who wrote the screenplay for Dr. Strangelove, and by young John Cleese and Graham Chapman before they formed Monty Python, it hosts a wide array of cameos, credited and not, from Spike Milligan (of the Goons, Sellers' former comedy partner), Roman Polansky, Yul Brynner, Cleese and Chapman (of Monty Python), Raquel Welch, Laurence Harvey, Christopher Lee, and a wider array of personalities and newscasters which were well-known in the UK at that time. It was directed by Joseph McGrath, who also helped with the screenwriting, and who was one of the directors of the 1967 Casino Royale. The Magic Christian has the same slap-dash sense of fun. It seemed everyone wanted to get in with the fun. And fun it is; it must have been fun to make and it is fun to watch.<br /><br />Beneath the humor, the Magic Christian has a cynical dark streak. The premise of the movie is that everyone has his price. While this may be a pessimistic commentary on human nature, it is verified time and again in this movie. As shown in the film the extent to which people will go to get money borders at times the mundane, other times to the surprising, and in the climax of the film, to the disgusting. While at places the movie appears dated  -- it was released in 1969 -- it is worth watching, if not to see a Beatle on the screen.<br /><br />It is positively anarchic in the targets of its satiric arrow. Nothing is sacred. At times it is just plain silly, but most of the time it is subversive and iconoclastic, destroying whatever validity its targets may have had. If you are a fan of Monty Python, or if you take nothing or few things seriously, as this film does, you'll love this movie.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|John Stockwell plays Micheal Harlan, or motorhead Mike to his friends. His teacher Dennis Hopper, tells him that the only way he can pass, is to turn in a science project, that isn't in anyway connected to cars. Since Mike can do that in his sleep, now to really set this up. The movie opens in 1950, where a UFO makes a mockery of the airforce, before it crashes. They bring Eisenhower in to asses the situation, and he decides that the UFO's remains be destroyed. Now cut to the future, Harlan decides to find his science project in a Military Junkyard, and amazingly the junkyard is also on the same base that the UFO was at. Now harlan had been pestered by the schoolpaper's reporter, and she wanted to get an interview with Harlan. He decides to take her out on a date, to the Junkyard, while there he stumbles into an underground bunker. And finds a gizmo of some kind, that gives off it's own energy, and unwitttingly unleashes the power of the unkown, dimensions get crossed as well as timewarps. Like i've said before, this movie was never meant to win any major awards, but it's a fun movie, and Hopper plays it that way as do the other actors. A good friday night date movie.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|This was the first movie i seen in the series, it made me want to go see them all. very good!!! good actress!!!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Love this movie! Saw it twice in the theater and then again several times at home. Will definately be buying this one. It has everything you want in an action movie...awesome stunts, hilarious dialogue, gorgeous actors...the works! If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for??? Watch it TODAY...you won't be sad you did!
B008J34466|3.0|You can tell Pink is happier now, this new album just doesn't have the kick the shit out of you that her others do. But over all it is still a good listen
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing story that will leave you wanting more. From the beginning until the very last page this book captivates you and you will not be able to put it down.
B00001OH7U|5.0|David Bowie's Station To Station, one of the finest rock albums ever. Your guess is as good as anyones as to what the songs are all about. David is such a surrealist, even he can't remember. Rumour is Elizabeth Taylor fronted the money for this album, what a coup financially for her. There is even a picture of her  smothering the Thin White Duke with hugs and kisses circa 1976. David seemed to have liked it, too. Favorite cuts:all of them. Wild Is the Wind was a song from one of Liz's movies when she was an ingenue in the fifties. No finer rock guitars than the duo of Earle Slick and Carlos Alomar. Lotsa of AOR FM airplay for the title cut and STAY. Top dance hit Golden Years,supposedly about Angie Bowie. TVC15 who knows? Just a great song. Word on a Wing, almost an epiphany.
B008S80P38|4.0|I love deadmau5 and I love this album the only reason it lost a star is because out of box a track skips. there is a small nick in the cds face. I chose to lose the song instead of waiting for a replacement.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|When I first saw this app, I wasn't too sure if I would like it, but after getting it for my Kindle I find it very entertaining and fun but I wish there were more coins available without having to pay for them. It's a great game to pass the time!!!!
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I pre-ordered this cd as I have read the books and had hoped that a cd would be produced of the music referenced in the books.  I went looking for it and found it listed here and was allowed to pre-order.  Very pleased with the content and the process for obtaining it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Mine did the same. All you need to do to fix is uninstall and re-install immediately. That will fix it. And now for the response. Youtube downloading. Two things I used to never be able to put in the same sentence. now. I finally can. thank you. -Kitty Johnson KF user
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Not what I expected...<br /><br />I muted most of the corny music numbers. Just couldn't take it.<br /><br />Tom Cruise has a couple funny spots, otherwise I'd like a refund. Anyway just not for me.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me and I was certaintly surprised that it was difficult to put down once I started. What an amazing story.... I loved the book and highly recommd it to everyone !
B00913DPW2|4.0|I enjoyed this game, and honestly found myself addicted to solving the mystery!  I finally gave up however, at the tomb where you must solve the slide puzzles.  I spent WAY too much time trying to get it right, and had to put the game away out of frustration.  Maybe I will try again some day.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I find this album inspiring, because attention was paid to the songs themselves, and Fagen with Michael Leonhart talk about how they actually started these songs in Garageband:    [...]    \\"With this record what I did is I had these demos. After I wrote them on a piano, I put them on GarageBand, the Apple program, and sequenced them in a crude way.\\"    I dig the lo-fi sounds that are ostensible on tracks like \\"Slinky Thing\\", but the tune is carried well. Any recording effort encounters subjectivity in terms of deciding on tones of instruments (you might spend hours on getting the right guitar tone, then scrap it later for something else), and the lesson here is that while those things matter, it's the songs (melody and harmony), lyrics, and feel (groove) that matter.    For me it completely legitimizes the \\"home recording\\" process.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|My wife and I enjoy watching this movie every year.  It's a classic story that never grows old.  I highly recommend this movie!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Some reviewers have given this book one star based on the price, and while I will say it is much too expensive for a digital book, my review is based on the book itself.  Let me add that I was given this as a gift - I never would have paid so much for a digital copy.<br /><br />This book is a detailed look at the villagers centred around a tragic, sudden death.  It's fascinating reading about the thoughts that go through their heads.  They are all extremely flawed in different ways and the way they treat their children is appalling, but I loved every minute of it.  I thought it was very well written, and it stayed with me long after it was done.  I was very stressed out towards the end, wondering how it was going to wrap up, but the ending was appropriate.  It's not Hollywood, with bombs and car chases and tons of action, but it was skillfully done.  I think J.K. Rowling has proven herself to be not just a great storyteller (with Harry Potter) but a masterful writer.  Give it a try and you might be pleasantly surprised.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I bought this movie years ago when it was on VHS so I was glad to see a digitally remastered version on DVD.  I never tire of this movie as my wife and I make it a tradition to watch this movie every year.
B008N2Z1L0|1.0|Even with the different instruments and style changing, this band still sounds exactly the same as they did in the beginning!  This is the main reason why this type of alternative music didn't last as most of the other bands in this same category have shown. It's a monotonousness sound, these 90's and 2000's alt bands good for a few albums and some hits but than everything from than on could be the same songs with different names! This genre of music has proven to be one of the disposable in music history!
B00004TS0E|5.0|This movie is a great remake of a classic.  Remakes aren't always the best but this one is an exception as it is just as good as previous versions.  Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|Pretty awesome!!! I could not put the game down... very challenging. Only pitfall I have is when my kindle volume is halfway down I can't hear anything otherwise very entertaining.
1401216676|1.0|I bought the product, and it said the condition was new. I don't tolerate companies that say the product is new, but in reality its really not. On several of the pages in this book, there were multiple green pen marks. I was going to keep this book as a collection after reading it, but not anymore.<br />  On a side note the story is really good, which I would rate a 5/5. The past of Joker is revealed, and you learn much more about him. This is a must buy for Batman, and Joker fans. Just don't buy from this company!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This collectors edition was a steal at $20. Considering the fact that retail stores were selling a singular DVD for over $20, the fact that amazon offered a bluray3d/bluray/dvd/digitalcopy/music bundle for $20 is incredible! Not to mention it is arguably the best superhero movie of the summer (sorry Dark Knight fans, great movie too!). Amazon will forever be my source of release day movies, because their price cannnnnot be beaten.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Most of the levels aren't difficult and I breezed through them... Even still I couldn't stop playing it! Great way to spend a few spare minutes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have never been much of a reader. I started reading a couple months ago and picked up on the first book Percy Jackson the lighting thief and was hooked by book one. I finished this book yesterday and it has defiantly lived up to everything and more hat I expected! Now I am just disappointed I have to wait a year to read the next book.
B009329ZF2|2.0|Spoiler - one of 5 alien ships that travel an unheard of distance to earth crashes into one of our satellites and then plunges to earth to be destroyed...um, I couldn't get past the idiocy that we're to accept that a superior intelligence doesn't have radar on their ships so they don't run into stuff. And that was after 25 minutes of \\"character creating\\" footage. Thank god for fast forward...Loved the special effects, though - I'm a ridiculous sucker for them...
B000PHX8C0|5.0|This album is 'bow down' worthy for sure.  Most likely to be their best CD ever!!!  This was a major breakthrough for them, they finally have found the foundation for their true sound.  There is nothing on this album that does NOT scream \\"BRUTALITY\\" and just all out awesomeness!!
1451675046|4.0|I got the audio version of the book.  I have never listened to an audio book in my life. Why? I prefer Text based reading. That said, my review will reflect my bias but with room to reflect where I feel the Text based book might flourish.<br /><br />The book is chocked filled with excellent information, giving someone the rudiments of a vast vary of Scientific topics. Regardless of which version you buy, you are at the very least getting the facts from a top notch source.<br /><br />Sadly, you can tell that it is written for children. I am unsure if the tone is present in the book but I definitely felt talked down to in the audio version. I looked into the book with Amazon's preview of it and it seems to be present there was well. Although it just might be me inferring it from the audio.<br /><br />Too much time is spent on mythology and I think we could of had a better book without these added in. Granted, they do a good job of bridging into the various topics of how various cultures over time have looked at what Science has given us answers to.<br /><br />I was dismayed at the information that was omitted from the book. Not because Richard Dawkins doesn't think you are unable to understand it but because he himself doesn't understand it.<br /><br />Also could of done without the interjected opinions on \\"Inferior\\" Pink Panther films.<br /><br />Not bad though. Worth picking up a copy of, regardless of how you prefer your books. Also look into [[ASIN:0307885151 A Short History of Nearly Everything: Special Illustrated Edition]]<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather just read the pertinent text to each of the Sciences that he discusses. Such as [[ASIN:0451529065 The Origin Of Species: 150th Anniversary Edition]] for an understanding of Evolution.<br /><br />That's just me,though. *shrugs*
B008220AVW|5.0|This movie was excellent!  I'm 31 years old and think that this is a great movie for any age.  The story of her life was great and an amazing view of \\"behind the scenes\\" of a major tour.  If you liked Justin Bieber's Movie, you'll love this one as well!
B00846REIS|4.0|I loved this book!! When I started reading it I found many similarities to 50 Shades, however,  as I continued on I Eva and Gideon developed in a different way. I am now on book 2 and loving it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is now my new favorite book.  I am already reading it for a second time.  I can't wait until Entwined with You comes out.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Very good movie, like all the Marvel movies they could have went a little more into detail but all in all its great
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was well written and enjoyable to follow. The characters and the story were easy to sympathize with. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it! I was very quick to pick up the second in the series.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Igor this game to play and it was awesome.It has very good features like all of the teamlava games. It also is easy for any age to play. My cousin is 3 and he loves this game. So I would recommend this game to anyone
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I'm new on the automatic watches department, so the only thing i can say is that it is huge, heavy, nice looking, quality build, accurate (mine gains only 3 seconds per day), it is a good one for dudes, i will get the yellow and the black one in the next month,<br /><br />MM, what else... did i say great watch?...
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I chose this app for the different bible reading plans as I already have a bible on my kindle.  The plans are pretty good.  Although I have not had this for an exteneded period of time, what I have discovered works really well.  I also have this on my Lucid phone and I like that I can be e-mailed the next day to the plan and the time you want it delivered to your phone
B006LSZECO|2.0|Very disappointed in the ending!  It was a good book up until then.  I would not recommend it.  Not worth the money.
B0037Z8SLI|5.0|The Checklist Manifesto [[ASIN:0312430000 The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right]] is a great read and has wide application as shown by some of the stories.<br /><br />The author is a great storyteller and I am now obtaining some of his other works to read.<br /><br />Every manager and health professional should read it. There is also a great story about its profitable application by a venture capitalist.<br /><br />Basically, I believe everyone will enjoy and benefit from reading this book - what more can I say!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follet is a great writer and I really enjoyed his book \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". This \\"sequal\\" is another great piece of historical fiction.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This was a great read but just wasn't as good as the first one till the very end! Just going to have to wait for the third one now!
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Full disclosure, I'm only 1/3 way into book, but writing has a rushed feel to it. Was author trying to publish before Mr. Jobs' amazing life ended? Nothing so far is terribly probing about Mr. Jobs' life. But it's an entertaining read, even though I know a sad ending lies ahead.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Amazing read! I couldn't put it down. The writing is great and the plot hooks you from the very beginning.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will keep me going with the series. I love the way this book delves into the corruption within the Capital. you will love it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Fun . . Romantic. . Psychotic. . Thrilling. . Tormenting. . A beautiful fantasy!  I enjoyed everything about the book read the second one and can not wait for the third to come out in December
0307279189|4.0|I finished it in two nights. It's a great anthropological, scientific, medical story with a twist in the style of Radiolab.  I.e. It provides knowledge in the context of a narrative. The reader is led down the path, but the only time I ever *felt* led was a little bit about the shoe industry. Though valid, it read a little angrily to me.<br /><br />Having said that, the story was compelling and fascinating. The pacing was good. He conveyed his message about \\"running is for all\\" without being very preachy about it. There wasn't anything I disliked enough about the story to mention. Maybe a couple typos?<br /><br />So 4 out of 5 where \\"1\\" is \\"chuck it across the room\\" and \\"5\\" is life-altering.<br /><br />On a social scale I like it enough to recommend to anyone I know.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|Soon as I heard my boy from True Blood trying hard to push an american accent I knew this movie would not be worth my time. Acting sucks from everyone accept the aliens, but the effects were the only thing that got an extra star from me. Trust me. Rent it. Put is not collection worthy.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|great game...I look forward to the second enigmatis. I love great hhidden object games with a story line and an objective..Big Fish Games has held my attention a lot recently...keepup the good work...works flawlessly on my kindle fire. I hope it continues to work on the new kindle HD I am waiting on..
B008FPOIT6|3.0|This book had great promise with a quest for immortality and a puzzle in a coded manuscript, along with a secret society.  I kept reading , hoping for a wonderful conclusion to the mystery and was left bereft of a satisfying conclusion.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I too am a Veteran but one who did not see combat but my father who served in the Vietnam War did & a brother who faught in Iraq at the fall of Sadom Husaain. I thought the book was well written & gave me insight to what it is like to risk your life..literally.. for your country. The chapter on OBL was the most interesting as i felt it would be thats why i purchased the book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Read Fearless while recovering from back surgery. All I can say is one of the best books Ive read in a long time. Great man, God bless him and his family
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy playing it.  Works better using a stylus to move cards.  Alway love to play Solitaire. Works well and is competitive with larger computer games.
0684857219|5.0|Good reference guide for bodybuilding athletes and nonathletes. The author long experience as professional bodybuilding, contributed with valuable information for beginners and experienced practitioners.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|In this second book, the depth of the characters is further revealed. Gideon and Eva are troubled, tortured souls but very likable. You are rooting for them as you ride their own and combined emotional roller coasters. The story has many twists, turns, angst and deliciously described sex scenes. You FEEL their passion. It is well written. You should read Bared To You first, but you could understand the story if you didn't. I couldn't put the book down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so addictive. It's a vey simple concept, but lots of objectives, and it really does require skill!
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I just started listening to Amy Winehouse after hearing Nas' \\"Cherry Wine\\". She killed it on that track and I was very intrigued. After not really paying much attention to her while she was alive, I figured I would give her a legit listen although I wasn't fond of Rehab all that much, so I decided to go with this album instead. Wow.<br />One of the best albums I've ever heard. Simple as that. I love the production here, its a hip melange of jazzy soul with R&B and Blues tinges. She is mesmerizing on every single track, her scatting will melt your face and when she goes for that rare high note, she picks her spots and hits it out of the park! Every choice she makes vocally is on point, every road she goes down takes you to a very special place. I can't even pick a favorite track, I need to go have another listen right now...This album is head shakingly good.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|What a great story for kids.....  my great niece just loves all of the Toy Story videos, and is always asking for them to be played.  As with all of the series, this one is great !
B000002GKT|5.0|This is an awesome CD. I have (had) this on vinal and I played the groves off. I have ruined a cassette tape too. The CD will last me longer. If you like live music then you should know about this. A must for all rockers!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was very impressed with how quickly the book moved.  I was a bit disappointed to find that there is still another book to read, but that's what you get when reading a series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow, what a great book, lots of suspense with Gideon and Eva, but in the end, they are a great couple who makes it work.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game its just so fun, I've played games like this before and at first its interesting but later you kinda get tired of it. This game make you want to expand your village its cool.
031620157X|5.0|This book is amazing! i really love it! i'm so proud of Chris for this book and can't wait for the second one.<br />i LOVE how different Alex and Connor see the fairy world, and i'm in love with Connor....!<br />Two thumbs up!!!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|i have been using Catch but recently added a kindle fire to my cadget collection. catch doesnt have a kindle app so i needed to make a change. discovered evernote. installed on my android phone, my kindle fire and pc<br />. I tested notes and photo syncing between all devices. i like it! works great.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Fine product and packaging and of course a great film to watch over and over again!<br />However, I wished that the extra features would of included more in depth how it was done features for HULK and other speacial effects!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love it. I want me a man like that well, kinda. I love allthe people in this book the friends and coworkers all great!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|lots of options and easy to use. I love the fact that each sounds volume can be customized in the mixes.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This is a good book.  I love the TV show \\"Castle\\" and this was a natural connection to the book.  The interaction between Nikki and Jameson is funny and serious at the same time.  I thought I had it figured out but was surprised by who really committed the crime.  It is not so graphic that it is hard to read through.  If you are looking for sex scenes then this is not it and I do appreciate that.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|In the future the real world is not such a wonderful place to live in anymore. So the majority of people looks for escape in an alternate reality - video game OASIS. It's not accurate calling it a video game, OASIS is a simulation of life with education, quests and everything you need. And you can look like anything you want - you don't have to be ugly, fat, bald...<br />When creator and owner of OASIS James Halliday dies, he does not make an ordinary will. No, geeks are known for their originality. ;-) Halliday declares that the first user who discovers an easter egg (hidden feature) in the OASIS, will get everything. So the race is on. Single users, organised groups and even rich corporations try to find it.<br />We follow the story of Wade Watts, Halliday's fan as he tries to be the first.<br /><br />There is a little bit of lingo related to video games in this book, but not much, and I think that even non-gamers will understand the meaning. As a MMORPG player I did not have that problems, my only problem was that I often had an overwhelming desire to go and play a little myself when I read about gaming in the book. :D<br />Also, there are A LOT of references to movies, games, music, series and other culture from the late 70s and 80s. Since I was born at the start of the 80s, a lot of those things were unknown to me, so Google was very handy at those moments. :)<br /><br />I must admit I enjoyed reading this story more than I expected. Ernest Cline delivers a fun and exciting adventure for readers of every age (and there's even a little bit of romance).<br /><br />I recommend this book to: fans of video games, people suffering from 80s nostalgia, young adult sf readers that are looking for something different and everyone that want to read exciting science fiction adventure.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game! I love it because it doesn't need wifi to play and its a awesome time killer. when you go to bed and you wake up you have 53 or more coins it is awesome do buy and forget all the bad reviews
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|must read !! Percy Jackson story is far from over. With the whole new group of demigods, Percy and Jason travel to their most challenging journey ever !<br />I started reading the book and i couldn't stop until i was finished ! greta recommendation !
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing and compelling. Character development is rich and touching. I could not put it down, was drawn deeply in to the plot and cheered/cried as Juliette struggled to find answers about her closed off society.  I will definitely read more from this author. Nicely done, Hugh. Five big stars!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this is a great game. I have had no problems with on my kindle and the game play is just right for the size of the screen.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Love this game. Like the game jewles too. Keeps you challenged. I have a hard time putting it down. I think<br />it is good for young and old.<br />  reader
098555780X|4.0|Before last August I probably didn't even know what 'paracord' was. I read an article in the newspaper that had a picture of the bracelet and story behind it. A couple of weeks later I started buying material. I can probably hold my own in a cobra knot contest now but realized I had to try other things. I think previously knitting and crocheting helped, but knew I needed other instruction. I researched the books available on Amazon.com and decided on \\"Paracord Fusion Ties\\" because it seemed to offer plenty for me to learn. I've been able to follow through enough that I've now made things using several different knots.  My adult kids are thoroughly impressed and request different things.  Following instructions in the book I can generally accommodate. There are some knots, including the \\"Monkey Fist\\", that I can't quite get the hang of, but I'll keep on trying.  The beauty of it is you can always just rip it out and start all over again.  My only drawback is that I get making things and want to try more, so I keep on buying materials, which can get a little costly over time.  I don't want to sell what I do, so I just chalk the expense up to \\"hobby time.\\"  The illustrations and instructions in the book are very adequate. I'm happy to have it and happy I read that article in August.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|For anyone wanting a mobile Bible, this one is amazing. Incredible resources for any User and very easy to use. Add to that, it's free!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|After every stage it crashes to home screen. Good game but can't finish level cause it crashes and keeps doing same level over and over.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|i use this on my kindle fire. not only does it work great its kinda fun to be able to write it :) also you dont have to worry about function keys or trying to find the symbol your looking for
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I Looove all the Percy Jackson books and I am 21 yrs old. This book is GOOD. Finishes it in 5 days and now I'm sad! The next book doesn't come out for another year :(
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Please save yourself the time and money I wasted on this book. I bought this on a friend's recommendation but after getting about halfway through I've finally given up - I simply cannot bear to read another word about Ana's blushing, flushing, muttering, murmuring life. The fact that this is a NY Times bestseller is a sad reflection on our country, and I am ashamed that my purchase helped put it there.  Please don't make the same mistake -- unless perhaps you are a 13-year old girl, in which case you *might* be able to look past the amateurish writing to get some enjoyment out of this joke of a novel.
0307730697|5.0|I have read many seal books and between this and chris kyles story in. can't choose a favorite highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an amazing true story
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun swap and match game with twists and challenges. I like that it has a &quot;goal&quot; to keep things from seeming pointless (though is there ever really a point?)
B008MEM24S|5.0|The levels are certainly challenging and how can you not love anything to do with Phineas and Ferb and Perry?
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Great book written by an awesomely crazed lunatic who knows how to tell a story. He writes in a way that makes you think about everything from what you drink and how much to what you do with you're life and why.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just read 50 Shades of Grey and wasnt sure how close this book would be to it but i love it just as much as i did 50 shades. It is different enough but it still has me hooked and i dont want to put my kindle down to stop reading. Great set of books.
B002JI94J4|1.0|You gotta be kidding!!! I like The Beatles and I like a lot the film. But sell it at $39.98 is pure greed!
0525953728|5.0|Thanks for doing what you do. My hat's off to the men and women who made the events of this book happen. They deserve our praise and stand as a testament to how well planned and well executed (pardon the pun) missions with full support can be successful without casualties to our boys. The personal aspect injected into recapping the actual raid and those leading up to it made me feel like I just experienced the life of an American warrior first hand. Awesome read.
B007THA4FI|2.0|No one can deny that J K Rowling is a talented, imaginative writer with great vision and the ability to create fascinating plots, realistic characters, inspiring settings and important themes; however, in her debut adult novel, some elements are less than stellar.  The basic premise, exploring the characters in two adjacent towns as they fight to fill a vacant council seat, has some merit, probably, but I had trouble distinguishing the characters and caring about them.  Eventually I did end up caring about a couple of them and Rowling succeeds in making them believable, but the theme is disheartening and the outcome depressing. Buy it to see how she writes for adults, but don't expect the quality or enchantment of the Harry Potter novels.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick riordin has once again accomplished his mission by keeping the readers on the edge<br />Once you read the book you will want to read the next so badly<br />The twist is quite a surprise and a sad one but this is a must read for all Percy Jackson fans as he finally meets annabeth and there are quite some cute moments between them<br />There is a lot of hazel , frank and Leo tension but the book is mainly about annabeth towards the end<br />Will she be able to fulfill her moms wish by facing her worst fear?<br />Well read read the book to know more
B008MM9630|5.0|i love this game its entertaining and the graphics are great but i love games that give you little challenges and anyway it gives you something to do in between classes
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app. I have used it for my art class tons! easy to follow once you get the hang of it. Great ideas for anything you can think of!
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|I am a huge fan of Santana.  I love how Carlos has defined and maintained such a unique and lyrical style of electric guitar playing that stands out as instantly recognizable among the thousands of expert guitarists working with that instrument.<br /><br />This album is very enjoyable.  I recognize as reasonably accurate the characterizations that other reviewers who gave it a lesser rating have used, such as \\"smooth jazz\\" (which I like personally), \\"elevator music\\" and \\"new age\\" (is that really a new insight into Santana. by the way?). I don't find categorizations of music terribly dispositive in general and not here specifically. If it's good to listen to, it's good to listen to. But those labels do fit to some extent so if they matter to you, be advised.<br /><br />One thing that struck me in listening to the disc that I don't see mentioned in the other reviews is its unusual (for Santana) amount of alluding to, borrowing or quoting other songs.  There is an incredible similarity between \\"Metatron\\" and Dylan's \\"Is Your Love in Vain\\" (Street Legal) although that is not acknowledged in the liner notes.  \\"Angelica Faith\\" quotes Carlos's own \\"Samba Para Ti\\" but I also hear a reference to the hook from Journey's \\"Foolish Heart\\".  \\"In the Light of a New Day\\" sounds in places like Lennon's \\"If I Fell\\" and the Carpenters' \\"Won't Last a Day Without You\\".  \\"Never the Same Again\\" alludes to \\"Song of the Wind\\" and also Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On?\\".  I'd be curious what others think of these thoughts and also if they hear others in these or other songs on the album.
B0077ATSZE|5.0|One of the best flix I've seen in a while. Acting is superb, as is directing. Story is very moving. All-round first-class job.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I enjoy the pattern games, and this is one of the best.  Varying patterns and an interesting flow to the story.  Very enjoyable and quite challenging.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I read all the books well before the movie came out. Of course my imagination is very different than the interpretation on the screen. In some areas I liked my view better but in other areas, the movie was a great enhancement.<br /><br />I loved seeing the movie in the theater but found that some of the shaky scenes were hard to watch (the camera movement was very wobbly). Watching it on our large screen at home, that issue was gone.<br /><br />The extras on the bonus disc are a little lacking. Lots of mundane chat and not a ton of substance.<br /><br />The ultra violet version is worthless to me on satellite internet since I can't download large files. Maybe some day.<br /><br />A recommended purchase if you didn't see the movie when it came out and if you did see it, still recommended if you enjoyed it. It is not all about children killing children. It is so much more than that. But you have to watch (or read) to get past that part and get the real intent of the story.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|We thought this movie was a remake of the TV show \\"The Avengers\\".  It is a bit too fantastic for our taste in movies.
B004418O0O|2.0|I love the \\"look\\" of this watch, but was disappointed to find out that it does not light up in any way, making it impossible to tell time at night or in the dark. My $27 Timex watch does this beautifully.<br />Why can't Swatch make that happen at a cost of $65? Even the areas on the watch which look like they would be glow in the dark, aren't.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This was a very interesting, even though sad, story from our favorite wizard Author, J K Rowling.  Though the plot was simple there are interesting character developments and interactions/links that made for a theme about people and their personalities and how what they did or didn't do had consequences that affected all of them.  There was a bit much obscene language but not so much that it made the reading a bad one. It was enjoyable and would recommend it to fans of Rowling and modern mystery, or social readers.  [[ASIN:B007THA4FI The Casual Vacancy]]
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book is different than others because it follows about 15 different characters rather than just a few.  That made it hard to get into at first: remembering all of their names and backgrounds and connections was very confusing in the beginning.  But once I understood what was going on I found myself very drawn into what was happening.  I'll be honest- this isn't a very happy story.  There was a little bit of dark humor but also blatantly depressing points throughout the story, and it was all set against a slight political background which was interesting.  I think Rowling did a good job of showing how desperate people can be to achieve some sort of happiness, but I would have preferred a slightly happier tone.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is one of the most fun gem games I have ever played!!! I love the quality of the graphics and the vivid color of the game.Call of Atlantis will definately keep my interest :-)
B003YFIUW8|4.0|A friend recommended this book and I completely enjoyed it. I especially liked that it was written from the child's point of view. Very thought provoking.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love love love this book.  Sylvia Day is a true storyteller.  I cannot wait for the next one.  Brilliant.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Warning!!!  It's super addictting!  Great app with no obvious flaws. It's like connect the dots on steroids.  Awesome brain exercise.

B008DVJO8C|5.0|Love it.. saw them in concert and had to buy the CD.This chick can rock!!! Play it loud, & often
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Before purchasing the CD, I attended the live Bob Dylan Tempest Tour at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut.<br /><br /> In addition to his \\"oldies\\", he played a lot of the new album. He had the audience of about 7,000 in is pocket! Granted, more time sitting at the piano and fewer harmonica riffs, he delivered his new material in a way only Bob Dyaln could...direct and to the point.<br /><br /> The CD reflects exactly the Dylan Live I experienced at Mohegan Sun. Best part, the CD for sale at the concert was 'way over-priced, but Amazon offered it well within my budget for such items.<br /><br /> Listen and enjoy!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Thank you Amazon. This is a great free apt. It's really worth the money if it wasn't the FAOTD. I had played  the PC demo version a while ago &amp; this a every bit as good. Great graphics &amp;  game play. It is one of those games that you'll want to play over again.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|awesome knife! needs work to get it perfect but if they completely finished the blade at the factory it would cost much more. the protective coating is crap and totally unnecessary, i recommend stripping it and sanding the blade smooth. the sheath is ok, but there are lots of great custom leather sheaths out the.  all in all, the blade is practically indestructible and holds a razor edge very well. great chopper! i definitely recommend this knife for the backwoods man/bush crafter..... cheers
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Awesome band. Wish there were more bands like them. Can't get enough of them! Their songwriting, in my opinion, is unmatched.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I played this game before online on my desktop and I am very happy to be able to play on my Kindle Fire! The bonus for me is that I got it for free!
B0086700CM|5.0|The kids love it and it is pretty addicting for adults as well.  I highly recommend this app as it is free as well.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Harry Hole is at his best trying to clear his ex girlfriend's son of murder as he uses what few trustworthy contacts he has in the Oslo police department to investigate the crime.  Unfortunately, this may be the last of the Harry Hole mysteries!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very fun. I love this arcade game. I like that I don't have to pay for the coins. Gathering prizes is fun.
B000FO0AOC|5.0|I bought it 3 weeks ago and I started out with disc 2, I haven't even had the chance to listen to number 1 bc 2 is so great. I'm looking forward to it though.
B009DP9D6A|1.0|This album was so disappointing! Repetitive and uncreative. Just looping over and over with beats recycled from many artists that have already done that. Lazy!
0671027344|5.0|First off, when authors write about any teenage angst problems, it normally turns me away. Perks of Being a Wallflower, however was written in such an excellent way that instead of being annoyed by Charlie, I felt for him and his problems with high school's social hierarchy, parents, sister, and his unrequitted love. The issues Chbosky writes about including drug usage, unplanned pregnancy, suicide, and homosexuality bring that edge to the book making it go beyond realistic, but at the same time making everything equally important to address to the audience. I love this book, and will definitely read and reread it. Props to Chbosky for writing the only book I will ever read that centers arounf teenage angst.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Love this game! This is an awesome batman game on my kindle fire! Worth every penny, especially for a Batman fan!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Both of my sons enjoyed this book. They have been a fan of Percy Jackson series. They have been anxiously awaiting this book since June 2012.<br />We hope Rick Riordan keeps em coming.
B000OVLINI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, written in a detective mantra. It felt like Emil the detective from my youth, which I also enjoyed. The plot line had some twists, but predicatable in ending. I expecially enjoyed the \\"full circle of life\\" in the ending.
0061726834|1.0|I borrowed this from the library, and I'm really glad I didn't pay money for it. I'm a reader who happens to be very turned off by authors who use gratuitous and unnecessary violence/cruelty towards animals in their stories. I thought this story was somewhat interesting and I was mostly engaged in it until about page 200, when I came across a scene that was revolting. I tried to just skip over the part I knew I didn't want to read, and then another chapter began not too long after that that I just knew would sicken me, so I stopped reading and very nearly threw the book across the room.<br /><br />I didn't really buy into the whole concept from the beginning, and I didn't really like the main character all that much. If I had I might have been able to finish the story despite the animal cruelty. As it happens, my disgust at the scenes included outweighs my curiosity as to how the story ends.<br /><br />Readers like me who can't stomach the suffering of animals should stay away from this story. At the very least check it out of the library and don't spend money on it.
B0029VT4Q4|5.0|The shorts were exactly as I'd have hoped.  They were shipped on time and the price was excellent!  I will definitely come back to this vendor when I need new shorts.
B009DQQF7Y|2.0|I am continually mystified by the cult-like devotion that Internet tastemakers, fellow music snobs (yes, I am part of that clique), some of my very good friends, assorted hipsters, etc. have for this band.<br /><br />At the same time, I almost feel guilty that I despise them so much.  On paper, GY!BE should be right up my alley: I love Ennio Morricone soundtracks, several \\"post-rock\\" bands from Slint to the Thrill Jockey roster, ambient experimental music from Eno to Tim Hecker.  I think Seer by the Swans is the year's best album.  I enjoy many minimalist modern classical music works.  Isis is a fantastic band.  What am I missing?  Why do I find GY!BE so annoying, boring, pretentious, and deficient in the technical/compositional chops as well as the emotional resonance that others seem to find?<br /><br />This album is just more of the same to me: poor and predictable use of repetition (unlike the Swans), clunky loud-soft dynamics, tuneless meandering.  And yes, I did listen to this album in its entirety, as I have their previous works.  On a good set of headphones no less.<br /><br />Obviously, there might be many who wish to throw electronic stones at my sacriligious review (which I admit is more of an apology or rant than an actual review).  I guess I wish to reassure any other doubters out there that yes, you are not alone.  There are others who \\"should\\" like GY!BE, but who are not yet moved to worship at their altar.
B0098VXE50|5.0|It was a good movie but I think they could have done more with it.  The action should have been more I think and the story line could have been more in-depth.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Enjoyed the book. Well written and you really get attached to the characters. The second 2 got a little cutty at some points. Transitions from some points to another were a little confusing
B008673ZAQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B008673ZAQ Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel]]<br />Loved this second book in the Crossfire series. I have<br />eagerly been awaiting it since reading Bared to You,  the first Crossfire Novel. I fell in love with the characters Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell in the first novel and was anxious to see how the story progressed.<br />Sylvia Day never disappoints you. I was enthralled from<br />the first page and had trouble putting it down. Gideon<br />and Eva are both two wounded souls doing their best to<br />get through their lives after tragic events in their<br />childhood that shapes who they are today. They find they are stronger together but they both have a lot to<br />overcome and many things happen that seem to push all the buttons and increase their feelings of insecurity.<br />A terrific read and hated when it ended. Wish they could make this story into a movie or a series. It was<br />Hot and Intense! Looking forward to the next book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is such a brainless addictive game. I can spend hours dumping those silly coins. a blast to play if you are trying go kill some time.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Great action almost makes up for the bad acting. Pretty realistic, and entertaining. Overall the movie Is a go. Four stars
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not as good as the first one but they never are. Still couldn't put it down! Love this whole series!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan strikes again, even as an adult, I can't put these books down til I'm finished. I can't WAIT for the next one!
0062014102|2.0|I found the discussion in part I of Bohm's and Pribram's work lucid and interesting. It was downhill after that. The holographic model was then used to \\"explain\\" the paranormal. References to quantum physics do not reflect the orthodox Copenhagen view--\\"...one of the basic tenets of quantum physics is that we are not discovering reality, but participating in its creation.\\" p. 191. The first part is true, but not the second part. According to the Copenhagen view, external reality--the thing in itself--remains enigmatic. Quantum mechanics is not about ultimate reality (apart from human perception). Ir is about appearances, our descriptions, what we can say about nature. Consciousness participates to create the phenomena of appearances, but it does not create the external world--the thing-in-itself. Talbot never mentions this Kantian distinction between appearance (phenomena) and external reality (noumena). Talbot's version of quantum theory is the popularized New Age interpretation that confuses the \\"observer\\" with consciousness. In the Copenhagen view, the observer is not the physicist doing the experiment, but the measuring equipment that records the data. Here the instrument \\"creates\\" the result by what it is designed and set up to measure--either a particle event or a wave event. Consciousness has nothing to do with the result as it is occurring in the experiment. Humans may cause their own extinction, but the planet and the rest of the universe will keep on going. Consciousness creates models of reality, not reality itself. If the mind could really change reality in any way it desired, we'd all be flying like birds. Sorry, but such a fantasy is a childhood hangover. It exemplifies primary process thinking, the state of primary narcissism of early toddlerhood, in which the world is perceived as an extension of the self. It is, so to speak, the holographic \\"you-niverse.\\"<br /><br />From a philosophical perspective, the New Age \\"consciousness creates external reality\\" view is an example of extreme idealism, known as \\"solipsism,\\" in which external reality is nothing but a product of the mind, and the self is therefore the only verifiable reality. Here are examples (from the HarperPerennial edition 1992): \\"reality is in a very large part a construct of the imagination.\\" p. 138 \\"The world [is] nothing but an objectivized dream...and whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely instantly comes to pass.\\" p. 153 \\"Indeed, if the universe is a holodeck, all things that appear stable and eternal, from the laws of physics to the substance of galaxies, would have to be viewed as reality fileds, will-o'-the-wisps no more or less real thatn the props in a giant, mutually shared dream. All permanence would have to be looked at as illusory, and only consciousness would be eternal, the consciousness of the living universe.\\" p. 159. \\"Contrary to what everyone knows is so, it may not be the brain that produces consciousness, but rather consciousness that creates the appearance of the brain--matter, space, time and everything else we are pleased to interpret as the physical universe.\\" p. 160. \\"...the mind is able to intercede in the implicate order, the holographic plate that gives birth to the hologram we call the universe, and thus create any reality or laws of physics that it wants to, then not only are such things possible, but virtually anything is possible.\\" p. 161. \\"...we are at heart just images, holographic constructs, created by thought.\\" p. 219. \\"...the mind may be able to alter the past as well.\\" p. 226. \\"...in a holographic universe...time is an illusion and reality is no more that a mind-created image...\\" p. 226. \\"...we are ultimately no more bound by space than we are by time.\\" p. 230. \\"Under the right circumstances our consciousness--the thinking, perceiveing part of us--can detach from the physical body and exist just about anywhere it wants to.\\" p. 234. \\"...encounters with UFO beings 'may be our first true quantum discovery in the large-scale world: The very act of observing it may be creating it as a concrete actuality, with sense, definition, and a consciousness of its own.'\\" p. 280-281. \\"Consciousness is not only a subtler from of matter, but it is more fundamental than matter...it is matter that has emerged from consciousness, and not the other way around.\\" p. 288.<br /><br />Solipsim is the opposite of extreme materialism, in which matter is fundamental, and consciousness is a mere epiphenomenon. While miraculous paranormal phenomena logically follow from an extreme idealism assumption, such an assumption is itself irrational and impossible to logically defend. Who is the solipsist debating? A figment of the imagination? I seriously question the authenticity of much of the paranormal superhuman feats detailed in the book. Much of it smacks of ego-inflation--a buffing of fingernails on the chest--which is so characteristic of the narcissism of New Age mythology. From an integral perspective (Ken Wilber), \\"The Holographic Universe\\" is an example of a pre/trans fallacy--pre-rational, magical, primitive thinking couched in trans-rational post-formal cognitive concepts. It is not a scientific explanation. It is myth making.
0316010669|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was a fast read too. Malcolm, as always, writes very well. Lots of great information packed in this book. It was worth my time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!!! I wanted to be her so badly. LOL!!! Good read. I could not tear myself away. I do not think comparing this to 50 shades is appropriate. This book is in a class by itself. Sylvia, I need another good read. Thanks!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I don't tend to play these kinds of games, but this one is done really well. well thought out. themed. plays smoothly on my HTC thunderbolt
B000BNX4MC|1.0|This film may have been a hoot when it came out, but Ferris Bueler has since grown up to be the kind of irresponsible stock broker and bank lender who took large chances with other people's money and just four years ago brought the entire economy down around our ears. John Hughes' comedies about over privileged Chicago North Shore teenagers are a relic of the Reagan years that we need to expose for what they are and get down to the serious business of building an economy in which there is a level playing field and financial wrong doers are punished and barred from misleading innocent people.<br /><br />It's difficult to believe that cute little Matthew Broderick who shown in Torch Song Trilogy lend himself to this garbage.
B007HU7NBK|3.0|Got the book on release day and finished it that night.  It was definately well written enough to hold my interest and I did enjoy much of the story.  I am torn between what is obviously a first hand account of my \\"glory days\\" as kid coming of age in the 80's with my favorite band and the glossing over of certain aspects of the bands history that I consider to be of the utmost importance.  Not complaining for complainings sake, but here are a few of my concerns.<br /><br />1.  The 1984 tour was just glossed over (for the most part).  Lots of interesting things happened on that tour of which I would have loved to have had John's insight.  I do understand that drugs tend to fog memories, but that tour was a huge deal.  Caught the 2/14/84 show and it still stands as one of my favorite concerts of all time.<br /><br />2.  I would have liked to read more about John's relationship with Andy during his time in the band, as well as after he left.  This also goes for the reunion era.  Andy's book did a little better with this subject.  A whole lot better than one sentence about the reunion split. Just wanted John's perspective. ****Disclaimer:  Big Andy fan here!<br /><br />3.  A little more depth about his relationships, personally, with the other band members during their \\"big\\" years.  Simon and, especially Nick, are strong personalities.  Would have been interesting to get some insight on how they really interacted during the craziness.<br /><br />I don't want to come across as totally hating the  book, because nothing could be further from the truth.  I thought John came across as honest and humble, and I do understand the politics of friendship and not wanting to step on their toes.  The insight would have been extremely interesting to say the least.<br /><br />Glad I read this book.  I really am.  But who can be 100% satisfied all the time?  Surely not me.  For what it's worth.
1469984202|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book.  I now have a new addition to my very short list of favorite authors.  Well written, characters I cared about, scenarios I worried about...this book had it all.  I lost a lot of sleep over this book since I do most of my reading at night before bed; I could never find a good place to stop!  I wonder how long it will be before someone turns this book in to a big screen hit, or better yet, a stellar TV series.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun to play. Good skill game for the grandkids to play with. Also a good game for driving to our camp, fun for all to play

B007Z9QS5K|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this film! :) I did not like Valentines day so I was pretty wary of watching it but was hooked from the first 5 minutes. Definitely see this if you want a comical take on the holiday!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Some series weakly drain away to their finish. Some are predictable to the point of eye-rolling frustration. This series is neither. You'll guess more or less how it's going to end because the author masterfully foreshadows and hints (with delightfully crafted suspense). But the details of the finale are still entertaining, and the world (which by this point you will have in your blood) remains true and robust. The author is heroic and keeps a firm and mighty hand to the final paragraph. And now that it's all over, I just want more. I miss the strength and elegance of this world's \\"physics\\" and all the amazement. Good stuff.
0525423656|3.0|I loved Matched, Crossed...not so much. It was alright and good enough that I will read the next, but I just didn't care about the characters like I did in the first book. I missed out on so much that the first book had to offer but none more than just feeling for the characters. I am hoping this was a quickly scribbed novel meant to bridge the gap between the first and third, and that the third will be as well writen and amazing as the first so my fingers are...crossed (terrible pun I know). So if your a fan of matched I will just say don't expect too much so you aren't let down but hope the third rocks it out ;)
0345505387|1.0|Although I love the story and the graphics were very well done, I was dissapointed in the book because the first 25 or so pages were bound out of sequence.  Very dissapointed. Glad I already knew the story line or I would have been very confused.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|From the writing, to the cinematography, to the acting and storyline, this show is a class act all the way around....And completely addicting.  Definitely a must watch for anyone who loves period pieces, but there's a bit of everything for everyone in this show...There's the romance, the intrigue, the drama.  All in all, a WONDERFUL show!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|\\"Reflected in You\\" was good as the first book in this series and Im excited about reading the next one!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Cant wait for book 3 to come out!!  I just love the story line of Eva and Gideon.  Always leaves me wanting more to read and that's why I'm sure book 3 will be the best yet to come!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Better than fifty shades by far.  Great story line and back story.  The dynamics of their relationship is intense and passionate.  Just as good (maybe even better) as the first novel in the series.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Paul is a bad man!  This is amazing!  More often than not when you hear an instrumental guitar album, one appreciates the virtuosity of the player. But finds that it is quite a task to find cohesion throughout.  I literally love every song on this disc.  Paul seems right at home behind the mic as well.  The one thing that is immediately apparent is when you realize that Paul is all about giving a song space to breathe.  To allow the other musicians to create a groove. Dare I say, that unlike his peers; IE, Satriani ,and Vai. Whom I find UN-listenable.  This is a realized group effort.  Amazing!
B001PPGAK8|3.0|The first two installments of the X Men films were great. The big absence however,of Brian Singer is painfully obvious while watching this.<br />Where Singer tended to hold back,Bret Ratner lets loose and you can really feel the inconsistency while watching. Two major plots are slopped together here and neither one is given due respect. Though the film does have a few highlights worth mentioning.<br />Kelsey Grammar as Beast exceeded all my expectations,yet the end result for the iconic Juggernaut (played by Vinnie Jones) was a huge let down.<br />The movie does pull some huge emotional weight in a few scenes that leave you in disbelief. The film also has alot of action which I felt was somewhat missing from the first two. It's just a shame it was added at the expense of the story.<br /><br />So what is the story?<br />The government has created a cure for genetic mutation (That was fast) while at the same time the supposedly dead Jean Grey returns from her watery end to wreak havoc on all her old friends. On top of this the long awaited war promised by Magneto since the first film is finally coming to pass. All are great ideas, the phoenix saga itself is one of the greatest comic book stories ever told. Too bad this adaptation of it was done so poorly.
0307749347|5.0|Love this CD . I listen to it over and over, getting new tips and concepts each time. I want to buy it for my son , my niece, my friend, and will probably think of more people that could benefit from this CD.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i love this game it reminds me of when me and my parrents used to goto an arcade and they had coin pushers . me and my step mom would spend about the whole time at one. the only issue i have is that its very annoying that it takes like 20 coins after all the coins fall but hey thats part of how they make money on the game
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a cute and fun.  The graphics are fabulous and the idea of the game is fun but it also was disappointing.  After you spend a good amount of coins to expand you still have to spend coins to clear the area.  The other problem I noticed is the amount of coins you spend to clear trees off your expanded area are an incredibly amount more in coins than the same tree around the border in other areas. This is not fair:(  Should cost the same.  Therefore it is going to take one way longer to clear that area since it costs a considerable amourt of coins.  Ex 1000 vs 10000. I guess when something is free there has to be something more to it.
0634060384|5.0|I am a user of The Real book.  I have the 4th, 5th and 6th editions now.  There are some duplications but what I like is when I do gigs, I don't need individual song sheets.  The jazz, balads, rock etc. are great oldies but goodies.  Music is concise and easy to read with exceptional chord theory.  My bass, horn and guitar accompanists' also have these versions and our sound is tight.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie is one of my top 5 greatest movies. It flowed from start to finish with a Fantastic story. The special effects were some of the best. The Blu-ray version is worth buying a Blu-ray player for this movie.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book, very well written. I have also read the series of 50 Shades and found so many similarities....but it was still a great read and I definitely couldn't put this one down!! Wish there was a third and even fourth book to this storyline.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|reminds me of bejeweled for the most part which I love. but also the quest of getting the crystals is a nice touch
B001BR5NH6|5.0|Just a good classic mid eighties \\"flick\\"....if your were in High School back then, you probably remember the movie. It was all over cable TV. A \\"must have\\" for your collection!
B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowling knows how to create a world. I came to really care about the characters and their lives.  This is not a \\"happily ever after\\" kind of tale, you‘ll want to look elsewhere if you‘re looking for hufflepuffs and rainbows.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Overall, I am really happy with the pinterest app on my fire... It is much more efficient and User friendly than when I was simply using the pinterest website on my fire. Sometimes it won't load when I first open it,  but of close it and reopen, it works great! Highly recommended!!
0425263908|2.0|I am only giving this a 2 because her writing style is so much better than the 50 Shades books.  I was so disappointed that this was just a better written version of the 50 Shades Trilogy and I can't believe there hasn't been more controversy about this being almost verbatim the same story as 50 Shades.  She's a great author, but this was nothing short of plagarism for me.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|We have waited forever for season 2 to go on sale, it finally did so we bought it. I think we finished it and season 3 within a few weeks. I love Castle, I haven't met anyone who hasn't liked it. I can't wait to see more!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Interesting look into a world that I would never take part. Very good acting. Lots of surprises. Highly recommend this show.
1408400944|5.0|I don't know if I can think of this book without picturing Jeremy Irons as Charles Ryder.  His work on the audiobook is top notch.  Highly reccommended for any fan of the novel.
1439152802|5.0|I had a lump in my throat and pit in my stomach the entire time I was devouring this book. I've read all of Kate Morton's novels with deep satisfaction, but none of them rocked me, choked me, and held me in a mysterious state of *dread* the way this one did. I began grieving the minute I began reading. But I wouldn't put it down. It was a personal journey of self-reflection and discovery as well as a compelling story.<br /><br />The novel opens with a jaw-dropping vignette told with little embellishment. It reminds me of a similar birthday celebration cut short with a cake knife, the incident that changed the course of the Mortmain family's idyllic life in \\"I Capture The Castle.\\" (A lovely classic coming-of-age drama in which, as in Morton's novels, transformation and redemption play large roles, and we are reminded that one can \\"come of age\\" over and over with the passage of time.) The events of that day are a climax and a begining at the same time.<br /><br />The story moves up and down stream from 1938 to 1941 to 1961 to 2011 without stumbling. The three main characters, Dorothy,  Vivien, and Laurel, are each classic Morton tropes: the mother with a past, the friend involved in a betrayal, and the daughter trying to find the answers that will solve a mystery and reveal her mother as a woman as well as a mum. The story belongs to Dorothy Nicolson, but it's up to her daughter Laurel to tell it.<br /><br />As an actress, Laurel is world famous for being able to slip into the coat of someone else's skin, to reveal what lies beneath without flaying them in grotesque caricature. We all eventually \\"turn into\\" our mothers but Laurel goes about it deliberately. Morton never strays too far into Laurel's professional life, keeping her moving and the narrative with her. But casting Laurel as an actress was a deliberate choice made by the author, one of many juicy literary devices employed throughout the novel.<br /><br />The supporting players, the men, are just as skillfully portrayed. Dorothy's first love Jimmy is uncomplicated and wholesome, an Everyman who is so easily loveable and who loves so easily. Even Jimmy's bit-player father leaves a powerful impression based purely on his presence alone. Dorothy's only son and Laurel's baby brother Gerry stands out from the \\"garden\\" of Nicolson daughters, not because he's the boy, or a witness or detective, but because Morton describes him so beautifully, even tenderly. Henry Jenkins is the most enigmatic of the supporting cast, but for most of the book, he should be. He is the man whose death so deeply shocks Laurel as it first flutters the carefully drawn curtains blacking out Dorothy's past.<br /><br /> As in her other novels, the passage of time, the past, heartbreak, love, mystery, secrets, and redemption are the themes each character must struggle with. Every character, not just the leads. Everyone had their cross to bear. Which of course is true for us all. We all bring our own experience to everything we read, and perhaps that's why I've been so much more profoundly moved by this novel. To have held vigil to loved ones' slow struggle, the unique labor of dying, brought so much to bloom behind the crackling backdrop of this story. It felt as though I was battling the book, as though it was dragging bits and pieces out of me just as much as I was trying to wrench it into a whole, manageable piece.<br /><br /> Laurel's journey to uncover her mother's secrets as she lay dying didn't feel like a race against the clock, which it so easily could have, under different author's curation. It flowed smoothly, an acceptance of the ravages of time united with the determination to sweep away as many cobwebs as possible in what little of that precious commodity remained. Morton doesn't spend too much time on minutiae, as she did in The Distant Hours, dulling what could've been a sharp tale. Here in The Secret Keeper her red-ribboned blade flashes as she deftly builds characters while moving the story forward at a gripping pace. She doles out bits and pieces like rationed boiled candy, enough to keep the reader satisfied while keeping you craving for more.<br /><br />This is not a beautiful novel. It is spare by Morton's standards. In sticking so closely to her characters, Morton sacrifices the beautiful sense of time and place she evoked almost too heavily in her previous works. It's like she consciously worked to shed descriptive material to focus on her characters thoughts, feelings, and reactions to each other and their environment, which is risky. Her one true outlet is through the lens of Jimmy's camera, allowing the narrative to pause to describe the horrors of the Blitz. This was a wise choice, because to understand what motivated each character, the reader needs understand something of the frenzied, fatalistic pathos that flourished amongst Londoners as the bombs rained down.<br /><br />In Morton's novels, the Big Mystery (the why, when, where, and how) is always paralleled with the measured discovery of the Who - the revealing details of the characters' personalities, strengths, flaws, and choices. She simultaneously fleshes out characters while flushing out the truth.<br /><br />There are many kinds of trials, many things to survive, many types of survivors. A common theme in Morton's work, each soul is this novel must struggle to survive their own challenges, the battles wrought by their own personalities. Even in the darkest night of the Blackout, where a sliver of light was criminal, life found a way to illuminate people's greatest flaws with harsh truths and harsher lies. Life also finds a way to grant second chances, so rare and precious that some, like Dorothy Nicolson, will never stop being grateful, and will do everything she can to make that second chance count. She dedicated herself to spreading light and locking away the dark shadows of her past. She spent time in reflection and spent time in reflecting the lessons she learned. We couldall stand to do the same.<br /><br /> We may each choose to wander in our own intentional darkness, but every now and then a book like this is a mirror focused on the reader with blinding inquisition, and all you can do is let it show you what you dare to let it. It's that infamous painful progress of life, moving you forward through time, bending and twisting you into whatever or whoever you're going to become.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|\\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" (2012 release; 85 min.) brings the unlikely but true story of how, Rodriguez, an obscure American musician who released 2 never-heard albums in the early 1970s became a music sensation in South Africa. As a music nerd, this became even more compelling as I will admit I had never heard of Rodriguez before.<br /><br />The first half of the movie centers around the efforts of two South African men in the music business, both fan of and curious about the mysterious Rodriguez to simply find out more about this guy. The movie then traces the beginnings of Rodriguez in the late 60s in Detroit (with archive footage of the city at that time, not much better than it is now, just haunting) and how Rodriguez's 1970 debut album \\"Cold Fact\\" first became an underground hit in South Africa at the height of the apartheid regime (with songs like \\"The Establishment Blues\\") and eventually became a genuine hit album. It is about midway through the movie that we are introduced to Rodriguez himself, in present day, as he and the two South African men eventually hook up in 1997, and they now retell the story of what happened then. We see footage of Rodriguez coming to South Africa in early 1998, and the scenes we get to witness are almost beyond belief and description.<br /><br />Several comments: Rodriguez (who now must be in his early 60s I think) comes across as a humble, truly down to earth guy, unfazed (and not bitter in the slightest) about how his life has unfolded. (The movie notes at the end that he still lives in the same modest downtown Detroit house he has lived in for 40 years.) As to the quality of his music, a mix of James Taylor-meets-Bob Dylan-meets Jim Croce, it is quite good and it only demonstrates again how unpredictable the music industry is: why does one good artist break through but others do not? Nobody knows. But the most burning question that I have on my mind is this: after the events in 1998, why has it taken another 14 years to bring this improbable story to US audiences? That aside, this is the second must-see, can't miss documentary I've seen in the last week (the other one being \\"The Imposter\\", check that one out also by all means). This is why I love well-made true-life documentaries as they always trump fiction. \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!this improbable story to US audiences? That aside, this is the second must-see, can't miss documentary I've seen in the last week (the other one being \\"The Imposter\\", check that one out also by all means).

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good play, and a different challenge for each level. The only problem with the game is the time limit isn't usually a factor.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As a mom, the very idea of The Hunger Games horrified me to the core. It didn't stop me from reading the novel, however, and I was completely sucked in. After devouring The Hunger Games and Catching Fire (my favorite of the trilogy), I impatiently awaited Mockingjay...which I promptly read in one, 6-hour sitting. When I hit the last word, I felt like I'd been KO'd.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is the master of tension. I literally couldn't put this book down. She's not afraid to kill characters as necessary and that keeps the danger real and fresh. The world building is spot-on. The scenes in District 13 and the Capital were vividly painted; even the day-to-day scenes gave a distinct slice of life. And I would even say Peeta's fate is a pro. That was shocking and horrendous and perfect and awful. I expected the gut-shot and got one.  Haymitch, awesome as always.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The pace was very nearly frenetic. And Katniss. Where's our warrior girl? She retreated into a shell-shocked version of herself, quietly using drugs to keep calm. Given everything she'd been through, that's understandable, but her collapse should have come later in the story, because she wandered a number of times. Gale...I've been team Peeta all along (disclaimer), but this book really cemented it for me. He's a revolutionary without compassion at times, and it disappointed me. Katniss's mother never really came to life in the book either.<br /><br />All in all, I gave the book four stars. It had some flaws and wasn't as tight as the first two, but it was a very good read (even if I felt exhausted when I finished it).

B007S3S8HO|1.0|This toy is completely silly and has no quality of fun to it.  I actually think the characters look cool.  I have them on display.  Other than that... my six year old said \\"stupid\\" (we did correct him on that word... say you don't like it!)  My 11 year old daughter just looked at it and asked what am I supposed to do?  When she tried... a roll of the eyes and she walked away.  Boxed up and put in the basement.  Any other questions?  Don't waste your time or money!  Go and buy the app if you want loads of fun!

B007L6VR6M|5.0|Wes Anderson is the most under-appreciated director of this generation. Sure, his fans are quick to expulse praise, but the general film-watching public has been slow to warm to Anderson's brand of quirk and charm.<br /><br />Moonrise Kingdom takes all of the Anderson trademarks and bakes them into a touching story about adolescent love. As expected, the writing is sharp, the direction precise, and the attention-to-detail mindboggling. With every subsequent viewing, you'll notice new details in the background and begin to smile at your favorite lines.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is stupendous. The transfer is clean and the extras are adequate. What more do you really need? At some point, it can be expected that a Criterion version will arrive, but for those who cannot bear the idea of not owning this masterpiece, you won't be disappointed with this disc.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I usually don't have time to read, but once I started it I couldn't put it down.  A cross between a Stephen King thriller and Lost, but it made perfect sense in the end.  Well written.

1469984202|5.0|My husband pressed his Kindle into my hands on Saturday, already open to the first chapter of the Wool Omnibus. Given my pressing schedule and writing of my OWN to get done, I made the crabby face at the intrusion...for about a minute and half.<br /><br />Then I was so CRAZY hooked, I dragged that stupid Kindle around the house: Kindle propped up while I peeled apples, Kindle resting on a plate holder so I could read while bathing, Kindle snuck under the blankets so spouse - who got me into this mess - wouldn't complain at 2:00am when I simply could NOT put that sucker down.<br /><br />Courageous plotting and a fresh read.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|Very good movie, different from what many people expected. This is about de Marylin Monroe success before hitting the US. Highly recommended.
B008IZYWXU|5.0|[[ASIN:B008IZYWXU Barcelona]]<br /><br />Given that this four-disc set contains material found elsewhere, I was able to find it for under $30 (including shipping, which was quick) and once I played \\"the\\" remastered and re-orchestrated disc, I was left speechless. WHAT A TRAGEDY we lost Freddie Mercury, at the young age of 45. This is musical and vocal brilliance personified. The DVD gets weepy, because you just want Freddie to be alive, and in this recording he truly is. WHAT A VOICE! And his pairing with Montserrat Caball&eacute; was nothing short of brilliant! Don't get me wrong: I love the Mike Moran \\"Barcelona\\" project which is mostly, if not all, piano, but this fully-fleshed out orchestral arrangement really gives you a further insight into what Freddie had in mind. He would have ROCKED the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, but his tragic death such a short time before the Olympics really pushed this entire project under the rug. I'd say if you can manage to purchase this for around $30, it's a steal. The only complaint I have is with the shipper. It was just wrapped in cardboard (albeit corrugated) but still, not enough to prevent a nice ding on the bottom right corner of the outer packaging of the 4-disc set.<br /><br />If you think Freddie Mercury is nothing more than Queen and his so-so solo effort Mr Bad Guy or The Great Pretender, get BARCELONA.<br /><br />You'll wonder where that magnificent voice was all those years!<br /><br />I'd give this six stars, but 5 is the limit!<br /><br />Keep on singing Freddie. You've left us with an incredible legacy, and for that, I thank you.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Fantastic movie about the holocaust years suffered by Jews in France, this is very real, the story about this Sarah girl will make you cry a few tears. This is a great movie, don't hesitate in buying it, it's highly recommended.

0061673730|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my motorcycle-loving man, after heading him mention that he was interested in reading it. He is a hard working man who never takes a minute to sit down and relax, and this book has captured his interest so much that he actually sits down to read! I can't wait to read it myself when he is finished with it.
0307887448|5.0|I had borrowed this book from the library, but I enjoyed it so much I had to buy a copy.  My husband, who doesn't read as much as I do, chewed through this book very quickly and really liked it too.  Very suspenseful, imaginative, and funny.  As a child of the 80's, it was a special treat for me to come across the bits of 80's-related trivia sprinkled throughout.  Best book I've read in quite a while.
B008RYN44U|2.0|Well, like a lot of reviewers I kinda feel down on that one. Settle down is a great \\"catch\\" song with a No Doubt sound but the rest of the songs are pretty \\"beige\\", no color, no flavor... :(<br />I miss the SkA sound, the energy No Doubt always had. I get that we are not in 95 anymore but it doesn't sound like No Doubt anymore either... I think this CD will stay on shelve...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like they way she continued the story line from the first book. The characters were fleshed out a little more in this book. The characters were a whole lot more real as reading through this book revealed just how messed up the people were. I hope Sylvia Day writes a third installment.. maybe seeing the characters help each other on their journey to being whole again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I truely love this game and this is no different to me as the 360 game and I do not understand any negative reviews for it.
B004EF2XC0|5.0|I stumbled upon this movie by accident and was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, the portrayal of poverty and its effect makes it a little bleak and heartbreaking to watch. However, this \\"dark\\" backdrop makes the beauty of this love story even more brilliant. I was totally captivated by the storyline and superb acting. Even the annoying sister (of Mr Thornton), Fanny, played her role so well that I dislike her very much. There are so many interesting aspects playing out, from class divide & business, to religion & friendships. And sometimes, with surprising twists. Above all, the tension between Mr Thornton and Margaret is the most intriguing element of North and South, climaxing to a beautiful ending! I thoroughly enjoyed this mini series and will probably watch it again and again.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|A delightful movie depicting the struggles of seniors trying to maintain their lifestyle. Comic yet poignant snippets with a bit of the culture of India.  Great performances by all.

Excellent product, excellent shipping and excellent book! Couldn't ask for more!!!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not wait for this book to be auto delivered to my Kindle!  I started reading it the very day it arrived and struggled to put it down until finished.  The story is an intriguing continuation of a touching and very exciting tale.  You can expect more seriously steamy sex scenes for Gideon and Eva, of course.  And a twisting plot line that may not be all together surprising, but is gut-wrenching and utterly satisfying. Loved this book just as much as I loved Sylvia Day's first Crossfire book.  Look forward to book 3!

Lives alone and all he is capable of doing is watching tv and dvd. He doesn't have cable just local programing but he does have dvd and bluray.<br />Thought this would be perfect for him and it was!  He loved the 1st season and can't wait for season 2.  The acting and storyline are superb!

B0085A9HXS|5.0|It's been a bit to see something not set in some ancient time where one's fighting style dominates another or there's some sort of vengeance from someone's death.  This is a great action flick with different plot twists and mix of good ol' martial arts, explosions and weapon's play that's also not over the top like a Bay, Schumacher or Bruckheimer film.  Would highly recommend this.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Okay, I am a HUGE fan of Ridley Scott AND of his second feature length film, \\"Alien\\" which is where the genesis of this movie came from.  What made that movie such a phenomenal flick is the stunning cinematography, story telling, pacing and acting -AND the visuals.  The grittiness of the characters, the tension between them before the movie really even gets going, watching them do their jobs -almost from a documentary style format.  That movie stunned audiences and deservedly so for 1979.<br /><br />This movie is a sort of \\"prequel\\" to \\"Alien\\" -though not completely.  The movie is obviously well filmed, has stunning visuals and effects, like its predecessor.  Now, to me -the acting was... okay.  You couldn't cut the tension with a knife -like in \\"Alien\\". The movie does, sort of, answer the question of where the aliens came from as well other little questions, like the \\"space jockey\\" and so forth.<br /><br />The time line for this movie is supposed to be before that of \\"Alien\\", though that movie was gritty (it WAS the 70's) and this film is very clean -too clean, almost like a \\"Star Trek\\" film.  There is no grittiness or realism to the characters -just nothing that makes you think these people could be you, me or anyone else.  To me this is a big issue as in the \\"Alien\\" film you could actually relate and connect to a degree with the characters.<br /><br />I admit that I did NOT see it in theaters, and ordered it as soon as it came out on blu ray (got a used copy, even!) so my excitement was high, and I admit that my expectations were thru the roof as well.  I also admit to being disappointed in this film... Scott is an excellent director (Alien, Gladiator, The Duellists, Black Hawk Down, BLADE RUNNER!) but this movie feels too commercial -there's nothing in it that makes me \\"dare to want to see it\\" like its predecessor. For \\"Alien\\" there were reports of people fainting, screaming and running out, and throwing up -if you went to see it, you were warned -this film you got none of that.<br /><br />Look, the bottom line is this: while I have complaints and issues with the film, I recommend it to those enthusiasts of the original \\"Alien\\" as it is an interesting entry after the fact.  I suggest if you've never seen it, before buying it, rent it -either thru Amazon or Redbox, first -then decide if buying it would be worth it to your budget.got none of that.<br /><br />Look, the bottom line is this: while I have complaints and issues with the film, I recommend it to those enthusiasts of the original \\"Alien\\" as it is an interesting entry after the fact.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Just as expected Indiana Jones is fantastic and being it's on bluray makes it look even better. Any fans of Indi should get this!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie had Amazing character development, great story and the visuals and action are mind blowing. Plus there is a sting at the end. Anyone who says otherwise is a communist and hates America and all the freedoms you love.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|Kept me wanting to continue reading. Fun to read and cheap through Amazon.  Good mix of easy to follow and make you stop to think.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|Cloud Atlas<br />This is an interesting and deep read.  The characters are well thought out and the plot is set to make any philosopher think. I read it in 3 days.<br />Couldn't put it down.
0316056871|4.0|I loved this book. It started a bit slow but it really picked up and was laugh out loud funny. I really enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started reading Wool Ombibus (Wool 1-5) and looked forward to reading it each day.  It kept me up late at night because I kept wanting to read just one more chapter.<br />I really cared about the characters and what happened to everyone.  I could also vividly picture the things Hugh wrote about.  I could see the landscape and the silos.  I absolutely enjoyed this 5 book edition and want more!  I will have to check out some of his other series!<br />Hugh you are an extremely enjoyable author!  Thanks!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game.  Seems to have reasonable opportunities to earn both types of credit.  Could be easier to acquire invest points - maybe trade city credits for them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a good book.  An excellent read to follow up the first book Bared to You. The story of Gideon and Eva is thrilling and can't wait for the third book.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|What a great book. The 5th Witness is an easy read and full of interesting plot twists. It is enjoyable and I recommend that anyone read it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It almost feels as if I am a social loafer here, just going along with the veritable tidal wave of top reviews; but I assure you, the review reader, that this was written with full capacities of my objective senses.<br /><br />That being said...the Wool Omnibus Edition was truly a pleasure to read front to back.  It followed me on my Kindle, and my mind, until I was able to consume the last sentence.  Amazing stuff, Mr. Howey.<br /><br />But please, no more Gangnam style!  People have been put out to cleaning for lesser offenses....  : )
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books were great! Book three was very interesting to read.I hope there will be another book  to this story.

0399157565|5.0|Patricia Cornwell does it again!  The Bone Bed is a smooth amalgamation of all the previous Scarpetta novels and includes all the best things from this series and Cornwell's writing combined into one book, the 20th of the Scarpetta series.<br /><br />From the beginning of the novel right until the end Cornwell presents a feast for all Scarpetta fans.  As she weaves an intricate story where we are given glimpses of sea turtles reminiscent of prehistoric creatures, water body recovery, an autopsy, new technology, social media, Kay's homemade cooking and plain old detective work, all described in such detail you'd think you were there, you can't help but feel like you are reading all Cornwell's previous novels at once.<br /><br />Back are the complicated relationships between all the main characters.  Kay and Benton struggle with their relationship, Lucy is her usual cryptic self keeping secrets from her aunt and Marino finds himself embroiled in a mess only he could manage to get himself into.  He should never fool with technology he doesn't understand.  Tidbits from the characters pasts and the return of a previous well-liked character are all welcome additions to this already  Scarpetta packed book.<br /><br />If you like to see Kay Scarpetta at her best then this book is for you.  I highly recommend this amazing read!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The Flow Free game is fun and challenging. It is not a do two things at the same time game. You have pay attention to your board and moves.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love this game! I'm hooked on it! It seems like you can never get ahead, but I still think it's fun seeing how fast I can go.
B00701L5XS|4.0|I really like this app, I am into scouts and camping and usually find myself out and about and needing to remember how to tie a specific knot.  This comes in handy and I love the extensiveness of the list of knots as well as the ability of creating my \\"Favorites\\" list to easily access the ones I use the most.  Plus it has the ability to see the knots in running 3D and being able to turn the knot around to see all sides is a nice bonus.  I know people have complained about the permissions on the app, and it is true that it has some permissions that I question why it needs them (which is why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars).  But I usually use the app when I am out of range of WiFi and have all radios turned off due to roaming, so it's not a problem trying to access the network in the app, since it's not available.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Excellent match 3 game. Keeps it challenging by introducing new things and changing the board. The graphics are pretty impressive too.
B007SGM084|5.0|I can't put this book down its so much better than I thought it would be yes it does have a lot of steamy scenes but its all necessary to build the characters read it
B003UBTX6S|5.0|this is a grate book for people who like a littel  exsitment and a love story. if you want the full story read the first book
0385344333|4.0|Jack Reacher is one the road again. When is he not? He is trying to hitch a ride to Virginia, but nobody will pick him up. Could it be the broken nose he has? But luck is on his side; he gets picked up by a trio, but soon realizes that they are not what they seem to be. Two are killers, the third their hostage. When Reacher escapes, he is determined to save the hostage. With the help of one FBI agent, it snowballs into more than either can handle.<br /><br />For fans of the Jack Reacher series, this is a good story. It kept me interested enough to not put the book down. It is fast-paced and filled with a lot of action. Just what I would expect from a Reacher novel. But it does seem that after 19 novels, the character is running out of steam. This wouldn't be the one to first read if you haven't read any of the previous ones. I still give it four stars.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Anthony Bourdain's wit, cynicism and charisma provide an entertaining backdrop as he details the inner workings of the upscale restaurant business. Bourdain does not hold back anything including even revelations of his darker days. If you enjoy him on 'No Reservations' you will enjoy Kitchen Confidential.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I very much like Meryl Streep, too, but this was one of the most BORING and negative films I've ever seen. I was determined to see it through to the end, but I was able to do so only by repeatedly putting it on \\"pause,\\" then leaving the room to wash dishes or make a snack or read my horoscope. The film's structure - incessantly jumping back and forth between Ms. Thatcher's memories and her present mental state - did not make the story any better or more interesting either. That technique just made it harder to follow the story. I understand that Ms. Thatcher was perceived as a leader and a very strong woman (iron-willed), but this film presented a very unflattering portrait of her as a selfish and self-centered woman, whose attitude seemed to be \\"it's my way or the highway.\\" The way she dressed down Geoffrey Howe (Anthony Head) at a cabinet meeting was brutal, rude, and insensitive, and just plain bully behavior.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book will change the way you look at food forever. It points out problems with the the modern diet and gives you the information on how to change it.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|When I read the 50 Shades Trilogy the first time I wished I knew the music that was serving as a backdrop for Ana and Christian's deepening relationship.  The only piece I was familiar with was the Pachelbel Canon In D.  This CD includes all of the classical music used in the books and the music is, as Ana often comments, wonderful.  I wish they would have noted to which pages the various cuts belonged.  As it was, I had an excuse to re-read the books (yet again) and play the appropriate music when I reached it in the book.  This definitely enhanced my enjoyment of the book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie was awesome! Lots of action, suspense!! YOu find yourself drawn in and yelling out loud! My family really enjoyed this movie!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Season Four was outstanding. I had missed some on TV so buying the complete season was the way to go. Plus I have the other three seasons.  Something to keep.
076115678X|5.0|I love this book. I have struggled with my curly hair all my life and I always straightened it. I have \\"gone curly\\" forever!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book, just as much as Bared to you! I couldn't put it down. I just can't wait to see what happens next!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Silvia Day has done it again! Im totally obsessed with Mr Gideon Cross.. Could not stop reading Reflected in You..can't wait for the next one in December :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I loved Season I of Homeland. I hope Season 2 provides the same level of entertainment without getting too weird or out there with the plotlines.
B008OOYALE|2.0|new update has caused force close every time I try to play.. getting on my nerves!!!<br />please get fixed I like to play...when its not messed up
1451696191|5.0|Touched my heart I love this book! its easy read and makes you feel everything that goes on<br />Yall should read this book RIGHT NOW!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game, I had previously played the free demo version, but couldn't justify the price of $4.99, so I was thrilled when it came up at FAOTD.  Kudos, Amazon - for finally offering up a true, FULL app, with no ads, no crappy permissions, no IAPs, no pay-to-play!  Just an awesome game, good story, escalating level of difficulty, fantastic graphics.  Plays great on HP TouchPad running Cyanogenmod 9 nightlies (ICS 4.0.4).  Thanks Playrix!
B0058W74UY|1.0|This app is horrible! I downloaded the app and could not get it to even open. It would start to open then cut off, after about 20 tries I deleted it. An absolute waste of time and storage.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|This release finds Paul McCartney in strong voice, though his appoach is much subtler than most of his earlier work.  In his take on these light jazz classics, the singer ranges between the agressive approach Frank Sinatra would often take and the laid back style of Bing Crosby.  The result is a deligtful middle ground that treats the songs with thoughtful phrasing without making them either boring and effete or too boisterous.  When more energy is needed, Paul steps it up such as on I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter and Ac-Centuate the Positive.  When a more nuanced approach is needed he tones it down perfectly such as on Irving Berlin's classic Always or the unique take he delivers with Bye Bye Blackbird.  There are many hits and very few misses.  Inch Worm is charmingly arranged though many may think of it more as a children's song.  Paul's take on the bluesy Get Yourself Another Fool is picture perfect.  And his original songs don't suffer a bit when compared to the old classics that comprise the balance of this brilliant collection.  The live versions of these songs show the depth of talent this man from Liverpool, England, possesses.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A great read! Starts right where the last left off and makes you feel every feeling you can amagin.  I love love love this book and the first one and I cant wait for the next to come out!!! This book was so well writen. The author really keep you in the book. I couldnt put it down until I finished it and the picked it up again.  Thank you for a great read!
B0071LLHGC|5.0|anything allman brothers is just fine,this version of in memory of elizabeth reed is one of the best i have heard.truely a home run,awesome
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Incredible mini-series. Own the first set and now this one which takes it to a whole new level. Plenty of nudity but goes along with the way the Romans were back then. Perverts. New actor does a great job taking the place of the late actor who was in the first series. A must to own for any Gladiator hungry fan.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book.  Ken Follett is a superb writer, and I'm looking forward to reading the third book in the Century trilogy!
B008XBCJ34|1.0|I am a fan of this movie, and picked up the 2D version twice, once when it came out, and got suckered in by not noticing it had zero special features. Brought the second release with all the cool extras. Now picked up the 3D limited edition naively, and just noticed that it comes with ZERO special features lol.<br /><br />Buy Prometheus. That comes with all three discs, AND hours upon hours of cool special features.<br /><br />This is a bare bones uber rip off.
B006LSZECO|5.0|We all know that the book is well written, based on the feedback. I am hoping that people will actually get something out of reading books like these and change their thoughts just a little to possibly make the world a slightly better place. This is well worth the time, and very creative and different. It kept me very interested in finding out what was going to happen next.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|really nice selection of formerly recorded soul and R&B hits by other performers. The arrangements have not be altered much. Seal's voice is perfect for these songs! I can and have listened to over and over!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Imagine Dragons is easily one of the top 5 new acts I've discovered (thanks to Amazon's recommendations). The vocals are perfect, the lyrics both uplifting (It's Time) and heart-breaking (Demons). I have a feeling this will be in my car's CD player pretty much non-stop for the next week or so.  Terrific stuff.  I look forward to seeing them live sometime.
1476712042|5.0|I really loved this book. One of my favorites I've read this year! I could not put it down & did not want it to end. I understand that the next book Walking Disaster is from Travis's point of view instead of Abbys.
1585104205|5.0|This is a great book to learn how to read latin with.  It follows a Roman family and what life was like back in their day.  It is the book my latin class is using.  The only thing is that the book is entirely in latin.  So if you don't understand a word, and you don't have a dictionary handy, you are up the creek.  The book DOES have pictures that help you learn the words, along with notes in the margin that are also equally helpful, but a dictionary would have been nice to add to it!
0425263908|5.0|I enjoyed this book just as much as fifty shades, maybe even a little more. Excited & waiting on the 2nd one to comme out now.
