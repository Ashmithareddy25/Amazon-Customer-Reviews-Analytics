0887307280|2.0|The E-Myth Revisited has a few valuable nuggets of information, but it's difficult wade through all the dense parable paragraphs with \\"Sarah\\" to find them. Michel Gerber is unquestionably an business writer of stature in the entrepreneurial space, but the book's format and content is too tired for our current era. Perhaps Gerber and his publishers might be interested in coming out with a revised and updated version, which could be very compelling.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Order v.s. Chaos is an amazingly addictive game.  It is like an obsession, it is acrually an addiction.  I will go to school and be thinking about playing this game.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I've loved Iron Man ever since I was a boy. I've seen the first and second movie, which were fantastic. However, Iron Man 3 wasn't nearly as good as the original two. Robert Downey Jr does amazingly well as Iron Man, and it's not different in the third movie. He definitely stole the movie with his great job playing Tony Stark. However, his acting wouldn't be enough to save this movie. The overall movie plot and idea aren't bad. The part that killed the movie was the ending. It was much too quick and wasn't as complex as the first of second movie. It's not bad, but neither is it great.
B00001QEE7|1.0|It would not play because it was in horrible condition.  If I was uptight about money, I would have been nagging about getting my money back.
B009LDD5E0|2.0|The last season of Glee served to only confirm that Glee is now nothing more than a radical left-wing propaganda platform.  From the utterly ridiculous \\"school shooting\\" episode to the season finale dedicated to shoving gay marriage propaganda down the throats of the viewers, what was once a creative and unique show is now only interesting to a small 5% of the population who are radical liberal progressives.<br /><br />The show can no longer be thought of as the wholesome family entertainment show you can watch with your kids. It is now the kind of show you will block your kids from watching so they don't get brainwashed with liberal ideals.<br /><br />The only real high point of S4 was the guest appearance of Jessica Sanchez in the finale. Her two performance were hands-down the best musical performances EVER shown on Glee.  Glee should bring Jessica Sanchez back and revert to being a music-oriented show, not a liberal political propaganda platform.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So much awesome shit goes down in this book. Whoa! This whole series is pretty mind-blowing. Worth the thousands of pages
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie to watch.  A lot of action and suspense.  Would recommend to watch.  Will re-watch over and over again.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|It's like reading twilight with some sex scenes....<br />it's like a teenager's novel. It was very disappointing.<br />boring, naive, boring...
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My 4yr old grandson loves this guy.  He takes it to the table when he eats and holds it's little tiny hands and talks to it.<br />The details are amazing and the mouth opens and closes.  Great T-Rex!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A very addictive game, love these hidden item games x<br />can drive you nuts but always come back for more especially if it's free x
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google has a relatively long history of trying to get into the TV device market and I should say this time they nailed it. What can be a better remote than your phone or tablet? You can use touch to navigate, use a proper keyboard when typing in search and so on. It's just awesome.<br /><br />Before I got Chromecast I used to watch Netflix on PS3 or a tablet because watching it on a PC was unbearable due to issues with Silverlight. Now I don't need any of that, I can just stream video or music from my Nexus 10 tablet or Android phone. It works beautifully. Streaming from a browser also works very well although it does consume a lot of CPU on my MacBook Pro running Linux. Hopefully this will be improved in newer versions of Chrome. Despite high CPU usage watching full-screen video I haven't noticed any lags, the audio stream perfectly matched video.<br /><br />Installation is very easy, even my grandma could do it with her eyes shut.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app you should get it.It loads fast all the time you should get it.It's  a family app
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was captivating!!!  It is a definite must read, no matter what your interest is.  The lead female character is so intriguing.  I highly recommend this book!  It was great!
1452126577|5.0|It's a funny book.I love this cat.When i'm in a bad mood and I read in this book , it's make me laugh.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Its Leonardo Dicaprio!! What else should I say besides this movie was great, he did a good job, and you should definitely watch the movie!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Excellent production and cast.  Outstanding TV and enjoyable family viewing.  Waiting for the new show to see the new adventures.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|There's a lot wrong with this book but somehow it manages to remain really enjoyable. Flawed characters, flawed relationships, flawed plot but still compelling. Glad I read it.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|I just received my Blu-ray of this concert.  I was lucky enough to watch the MDNA Tour on a windy/wet day in New York City NY last fall.  I also watched the Epix broadcast of this concert when it was shown earlier this year.  Sorry to say but I have to agree with the other reviewers.  There is a serious audio issue with any of the audio formats: DTS MA 5.1, DTS MA 2.0 or DTS - no bass, center channel sounds OK, but left, right and surround channels are almost inaudible.  What a disappointment!  I hope Amazon lets me return this...
B00338QENI|5.0|Seen this book several times and wasn't sure I would be interested. Read it without any pretense and wondered why I waited so long. True...don't judge a book by it's cover.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This box set includes all seasons and all episodes of &#34;Married with Children&#34;. I purchased the box set for my daughter to give to my husband on Father's Day, and he really loves it. He started with disc one, and even with watching every day we still have several discs left to view! I remember watching the show each week when it aired on Fox and following this wacky, funny and non-traditional family until the series finale. You will laugh and laugh and laugh!
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Could it be more intense?  I guess the only answer would be...I guess Season 9 will tell!  My head was spinning with all the twists and turn this season took.  Whew!  I'm actually glad to have a breather before the next season starts in May 2014.  Don't think you can watch this without needing a break.  Your body won't be able to take the stress if you attempt to watch it all at once.  Just remember one thing...BREATHE!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Don't buy this. It only supports Netflix and Youtube, and not very good at that. Extremely limiting!! Complete waste of $40. Instead, you'll want an Apple TV or Roku, which both support HUNDREDS of applications, not just two like Chromecast. Seriously Google, what's going on with you to release junk like this??
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This gets 5 stars. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were superb. She absolutely deserved the Academy Award as well as other awards for this film. The writing was great. Cast was great. Delivery was great. Highly recommend. Cast also includes, Robert Di Nero and Julia Stiles.
0142418471|4.0|I read this before giving it to my teenager.  I don't think he would have gotten past the first few chapters if I hadn't told him it gets interesting later... It was good in the end though.
B000I5SY5U|4.0|Really this entire movie is worth it just for Liza's two big numbers in the film. Her character is witty and funny. I recommend if you're into theatrical film. There are alot of modern references to Cabaret so if for nothing else, you will understand those better.
0316212377|4.0|The interactions of his AI intelligences are wonderful to read. The technologies he envisions are interesting and new, the story is a little... bare.  The main driving subject of the plot is rather abstract, and thus leaves the reader a little emotionally  distant from the  characters.  Not his best work, but fun to read.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I highly recommend this version of Les Miserables. It is a MUSICAL, so know that going in. The actors sing the majority of their lines. The really neat thing about this film is that all the singing is live and not pre-recorded. Great film with a great message. Props to Anne Hathaway (Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress) and Hugh Jackman. Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried do a wonderful job as well. I could pass on Russell Crowe's singing. It's not great. Helena Bonham Carter (Harry Potter) and Sascha Baron Cohen (Borat) are hilarious in their roles. Isabelle Allen was perfect for little Cosette.
B001QB9H1A|3.0|The digital copy was no longer valid. So not sure I could recommend this. The movie was enjoyable but the time stamp on the digital copy annoyed me.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|This was like a twisted fairytale... but not in a good way.I was very disappointed with the ending. It was cheesy AND they left out so many unanswered questions and holes from the beginning of the film. If you're looking for a suspenseful or horror or thriller film... look elsewhere.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got this for a new small 1080 hdtv in the guest room, so that the grown up kids can tune in Netflix with their smart phones when they're here.  I  opened the box at 6pm and was watching Emergency on Netflix by 6:15.  No buffering.<br /><br /> Here's what I had to do:  1) Plug in the Chromecast dongle into an HDMI port on the TV; plug USB cord into back of dongle and into USB on TV (if you don't have one, you can get the power from an electrical outlet, cord is long enough), change input source on TV to the HDMI where you have the Chromecast plugged in (although mine went there automatically); a web address is given to do the chromecast setup (google.com/chromecast/setup).  If you don't have chrome on your laptop, you will need to download it.  This is where Chromecast dongle gets sync'd up with your wireless network.  Then it will tell you you're read to cast.<br /><br />At this point I was a little puzzled, but here's what I had to do.  I had to go to the Google store and download the Netflix app for Chromecast to my laptop, or to my google cloud in the google store, I'm not sure.  I've checked and you can't use just Netflix.com; you have to get the specific Netflix app for Chromecast because it has the little \\"cast\\" icon in the right hand corner of the Netflix selection.  Now I had to sign into Google to get access to the store.  YouTube was already there, and I added the Netflix.  I imagine I will have to get the kids to download the Netflix app to their phone.  This is all one-time set-up stuff.  I clicked on the new Netflix app in the Google store and it looked just like regular Netflix, found my show, and accessed my show.  Once the show was ready on my laptop with the usual Netflix loading delays, I clicked on the \\"cast\\" icon and it appeared on my TV.  I then minimized and did some other stuff while the show was on.  You can't close it out as that definitely shuts it down.<br /><br />You have to have a wireless network, you have to have a Netflix subscription, you have to have a TV with an HDMI port (a USB makes it a little neater).  This isn't taking the place of my WII, but it is allowing me to view Netflix from my basement TV or guest room TVs.  Tomorrow I'm going to try it on my basement TV.  It looks like it will be pretty portable.<br /><br />Update 9/16:  Moved it to my basement tv, and it works perfectly, using the same name on the network.  Basement tv doesn't have the correct USB port, so I just used the plug supplied to get power from the electrical outlet.  I also tried browsing in hulu and cbs.com thru the google chrome browser and was able to cast the screen content over ...
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie is great! Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Miranda Cosgrove, Julie Andrews... it's great for children and adults of all ages. Funny and sweet. The minions are hilarious.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Great comic book movie! Fanboys and action lovers should rejoice. Karl Urban,in my opinion, would have made a good Batman.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I am a huge Baldacci fan and was hoping to find another character similar to Sean King and Oliver Stone. Reacher was too much of a tough guy. So much so that he is without credibility.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was hooked from the first chapter even after I would put it down I would think about until I could find time to read some more ... so I have bought the other two and have to go and she which book is next. Thanks for the ride.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This program really expands the usefulness of the Kindle Fire.  Now if only I had an external keyboard - that would make it great!
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|British TV has figured out how to present an engrossing series without grisly scenes of violence and sex. Not that both are not part of the storyline in Broadchurch, but rather it underlines the tension of the characters and its story. What you see is actors who know their craft and how to tell a story that is compelling and relevant.  I grow tired of our American TV series that leaves nothing to the imagination and insults the intelligence of the viewer.<br />Amazon offered the first episode for free and after watching it - I immediately bought the series. David Tennant and Olivia Colman are brilliant as police inspectors  trying to find the killer of an 11 year old boy who lived in a small English coastal town. Their character's lives intertwine into the storyline. It is TV at its best.
B0001I561E|5.0|Arrived on time is exactly what it says it is. Plays fine hope it lasts a lifetime however long that may be!! Thanks!!
B007IQX1G4|4.0|This movie was a lot better than i expected. The humor is a deft blend of dark comedy and farce, underpinned by believable and sympathetic characters.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|A incredible film that tells an amazing gothic story. Not just a monster that everyone should fear. I have watched this movies dozens and dozens of times and still love it!
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was a well comprehended book. It sucked me into the story.It felt so real.<br />I can't wait till the fourth book comes out.He makes us want to read more by leaving us on a cliff-hanger.<br /><br />  -haydn payne
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved the old version...the new one is useless.... bye app...have moved to accuweather app.  Let us know when you've fixed your mess!
B00003CXCQ|1.0|When I got the movie it was cracked at the edge of the DVD and scratched.  It stopped playing half way through the movie and would not play on any DVD player we have (4).  I requested my money back and did not receive an answer back..  I went to a local store in Chandler Arizona ZIA which sell used DVD/Bluray/records ect and got the same DVD/bluray/extra DVD in wonderful condition for 15.00.  I will shop there from now on as the store does not sell bad DVD's to customers and you know what you are getting for the same price or better
B0091REZMW|4.0|This hidden object game is addicting once you bypass the blab blahs of the background story. I just wish there was a way to earn diamonds fast since that is what is used to buy up energy. It takes too long to build up energy that gets used up searching 3 rooms.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My chromecast has to be, hands down, one of the best purchases I have ever made through amazon. It's everything I hoped it would be and more. Couldn't be happier.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|While the soundtrack contains an eclectic list of artists, the blend works extremely well and somehow still manages to fit the time period.<br /><br />Artists include:<br />Jay Z<br />Beyonce<br />Lana Del Ray<br />Jack White<br />Will.i.am<br />Elizabeth Debicki<br />Emili Sande<br />Fergie<br />Bryan Ferry<br />Gotye<br />Florence + The Machine<br />Nero<br />...and more.<br /><br />Listening to the music by itself won't do it justice, so give it a fair shot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like that it's challenging. I prefer games that require a little bit of thought but can be frequently interrupted. It's great for waiting rooms and while waiting to pick up the kids.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Really easy and super fast. I don't need to sir there all the time yo see whether its uploading or not. I downloaded the windows PC version real easy to sync and took fast..
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I got this things yesterday and I'm in the process of returning it. This thing has absolutely no redeeming value. It's called Chromecast but try streaming something, anything from Chrome, it doesn't work. The thing supposedly works with four apps, four. I'm extremely disappointed and would gladly give it zero star if that was an available option because it isn't worth even the measly $35.00 I paid for it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My son loves this game but is constantly asking for help clearing the endless pop-ups and adds.  He would give it 5 stars, but I give only 3 because it's annoying for me.
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|I don't know if it's me or what but I couldn't figure out how to access it so I never used it but the price was right, free
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  The musical value is far beyond any other CD from The Backstreet Boys.  The vocals are great - AJ really kills it!  Very catchy songs and beats.  I'm still not sure why they didn't release several of these as singles.  I wish their marketing would have been better back then (like it is now!).  I must suggest that you fall in love with \\"Unmistakable.\\"  It is the best track of the album!
B004BSJIUU|4.0|My favorite song on this album is definitely &#34;So She Dances.&#34; It was the reason that I bought the album, honestly. Give it a listen!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Great CD, buy it! I just wish they would come up north, maybe for the ND State Fair. LOVE THEM!
B002RVCD0U|3.0|This movie is decent.  The storyline is a little hectic and the fight scenes aren't all that believable, but if you want to see another movie with terminators in it, this is obviously it.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|This record is incredible, and so is Gregory Porter in general. There are many types of jazz, most of which I don't really enjoy as I find them to be too busy. This however, is just brilliant songwriting and vocal work and as a result someone like myself who listens to anything from metal bands to Adele, can really get into it. Seriously its now one of my favorite albums and a great addition to any 'baby making music' playlist. Saw him live a couple weeks ago and his talent is not restricted to the studio. He's a great performer as well.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app has it all in the easiest format.  If you are thinking about getting, do it......You will never need to look elsewhere for weather news
B009DH379C|5.0|I have enjoyed the music of Queen for many years, and I regret having never saw them in concert.  I enjoyed watching this DVD and hearing some of the great songs they recorded live.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I ended up deleting this game as there were no hints on how to play it, and I got to a point where I didn't know what to do to get any further in the game.
B000000OF6|5.0|What can I say, I enjoy Queen's music so I really enjoy listening to these CD's in my car.  Some of the best songs are on here, and songs I now am enjoying for the first time too.
B00005JMCN|4.0|This movie is not just for horsey people but also for those who root for the underdog. It shows strength in coming back from injuries.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is addicting not like, in a bad way, it's FUN addicting you<br /> should really get this game, I highly recommend it :)
B0001KZNLA|5.0|This movie was very entertaining!  Members of my family and I continue to use quotes (lines from this movie) to this day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hooked on the game for hours!!!!!  could not stop playing once I started. love the gamed!!!! try this game and have fun.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I love these headphones! They offer awesome sound for the price. Being close ear, you can get a little warm under there, but nothing my chilly room with an ac and fan don't fix! They are really comfortable and don't hurt my ears after hours of WoW. The quality of the materials used to make them is great and while I've dropped them several times and never broke them, my friend managed to break my first pair somehow (the plastic is pretty rigid, but I'm not sure what all was involved when they broke). But, I liked my pair so much I bought the same kind and I'm still using them. Even though I'm on my second pair, I've still spent about as much or less, had I gotten another pair of headphones and I doubt they would have been much better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We started watching the show a few weeks ago and quickly made it way through Season 1 and Season 2 and then on to Season 3.  Its a great show, whats not to love, scandal, british accents, adultery and war.  However my goodness the show is worse then a Spanish soap opera with its twists and turns!<br /><br />Can't wait for season 4
0786955570|4.0|Played this a few times with friends. While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really), it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral. The scenarios in the book provide a nice, gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session. There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose, you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P. Gameplay wise, the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities. I personally like this game, but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics. Overall, a fun game to pull out every once in a while when you feel like plundering a dungeon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game, it is very invigorating and interesting. I really do enjoy this game even my four year old sister.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the hunger games series is a quick and engaging read.  It will feed the preteen girl living within us all.
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|English Electric, a very good album with reminders of the days of old. Especially liked Helen of Troy which reminds me of Maid of Orleans.<br /><br />Good job OMD pls keep it up.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am speechless it is the best game I played in years good for all ages and with colourful beautiful animated dragons
B006ATAWUS|5.0|I read this book back in December 2012 for my book club. I have read it 3 more times since then. Absolutely wonderful read.
B004LROUNG|4.0|He is such a master at creating the characters. They come to life in this story, although the title is somewhat misleading, it is well worthwhile reading.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this series so it was only reasonable that I buy it. This was everything the seller said it would be & with very fast delivery! I'm very pleased with it all the way around!
B001TH7GT6|4.0|Nice quality cable for a fair price.  Allowed me to bypass the failed HDMI input on my HD TV and regain an HD picture vs having to but an new circuit board and labor charge
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great app. Lots of soothing sounds whether to lull you to sleep or just to sit and unwind after a busy day.
B001VU1NJ0|4.0|Good movie! Story is suspenseful with a twist towards the end. Thanks Amazon for including this one on instant video. Check it out!
B0012GMVG2|5.0|I purchased the CD to replace the album which I purchased when this first released. This has always been my favorite Toto!
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|great kid's movie, really funny for the whole family<br />my kid's and i have watched it three times and still love it
B005NPCUC8|5.0|a Favorite Pink Floyd release. I purchased a CD to enjoy as well as a download to work out with. Love this Album!
B001XUPGLY|5.0|if you are a big star trek fan you will love this oldie but goodie movie<br />very funny and entertaining
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Good cast and interesting episodes.  Will most certainly enjoy watching the entire series this time around.  I have always been a huge fan of all the StarTrek shows and this series will not disappoint.

0321934318|5.0|As with his other books, Scott Kelby hits a home run.  This book is good for experts and beginners alike.  The ability to go through each example on YOUR OWN COMPUTER is invaluable for training.  More advanced Lightroom users can skip around and get to the new features in LR 5.  Recommend it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Easy to use, fun to play, not too many distractions. I would download this again and refer to my friends...
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I was on the edge of the sofa the first, second, and third time I watched this movie. Denzel & Chris both out did themselves!!!  It is a MUST see movie!! Buy the DVD, this is a true story but to watch it on a regular TV channel with commercials doesn't do it justice.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love romance, Walking up Married, is one at its best!  So fun to read that I couldn't put it down!
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Good acting, great movie worth while to watch. My kids also enjoyed this. It a great follow up to the first movie in this series.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|The game is challenging, especially if you're not paying to win. You just need patience and you have to limit your playing time each day. Not a bad model.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I absolutely love the way that they portrayed Santa and the Easter Bunny.  The story is one of those movies you'll enjoy with your kids no matter how old they are.  They did an excellent job.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was funny and encouraging at the same time.  All parents need to watch this and be encouraged by it.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|And inspiring book that really got me thinking and questioning a lot of the status quo I see around me.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I didn't give this game a full 5 stars because it would glitch on occasion and I would have to use a hint to back out of a screen. Other than that this game was quite enjoyable. The puzzles are fun and not so complex that I was having difficulty with them.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Not sure why so many people are critical of this movie. If you are into sci fi's, this is one to add to your collection.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Challenging but I can't put it down.  Love ho games and this one hasn't disappointed me.  The puzzles in the dark really test your skills.
B008469DGY|5.0|i can play this for hours like an old nintendo game just over and over to see if you can get a higher score
B005544V6A|4.0|I didn't get to watch season 1 and am currently hooked on Suits. Like most shows it hadn't totally clicked everything into place in the beginning, but is still enjoyable.
0321543726|1.0|I took Professor Stroustrup's class at Texas A&M and we were required to purchase this textbook. The previous year, I'd used the draft of it prior to being published and found that it was really lacking how to learn C++ (much like his class). This published version is no different. Rather than using any of the frameworks out there, this book teaches new C++ programmers using his own library that's full of bugs. More often than not, you'll find that the sample code provided will not compile - heck, even his own framework will throw a large number of errors upon compiling.<br /><br />It was a pre-req to the course and it was useful for the homework assignments he'd issue us from it. Beyond that, if you're just looking for a programming how-to, skip over this one. There's got to be a better book out there for the price.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Tear jerker! I really liked the authors writing he really makes you fall in love with the characters. Would definitely recommend
B00CTXBO9M|3.0|Nice to have something that can be played without thinking too much. While waiting at doctor/dentist/ for hubby or anywhere, its a cute game
B008JLEUD0|5.0|Love it! I have played in more than 3x the first day I got it.<br />It is in my office now....
B000NMW6M0|3.0|Its all about making really bad decisions. A little over the top though. Ending was hurried. Maybe shouldn't take it too seriously.

0802473156|5.0|This was the first self-help book I read (about 2 years ago), and I've not yet found one that can rival it for usefulness. While it's not a magic panacea, there's a lot of salient points to it. I've just re-read it as I managed to pick it up in Vietnamese for my wife to read. She's maybe half way through it, and enjoying. We've already had some productive discussions arising from it.<br /><br />Sure, getting a dose of each of the five languages is also good, but it helped me productively think of ways to work on my marriage, and showed me that self-help books aren't just a pointless touchy-feely load of bollocks.

B00CTT9646|2.0|Okay people, first off I loved Into Darkness. With that said this amazon collection was a waste of $96. The Qmx phaser replica is the worst representation of the starfleet phaser. It has numerous flaws, scratches,and paint imperfections. The underside of the phaser is awful. Now im not talking about screen accuracies. Im talking about how its put together and how its molded. The pieces were forced together which causes them to be off set from the rest of the other pieces. It looks like a 3rd grader bought a model and was too impatient to take the time to make it look good and forced every single piece. My last problem is that the &#34;STUN/KILL&#34; function has to be done manually. There is no button for it to switch on its own. The pics on amazon.com are totally mis-leading. I could have gotten a better representation of a starfleet phaser if I had purchased the PLAYMATES toy back in '09. I will never buy anything Qmx again. This wa totally not worth the money spent. Especially now knowing Im gonna have to by the bluray again to get the special features I didnt get because I bought this phaser set.

0307700720|5.0|This a beautiful and complete set of Miss Austen's delightful works! It includes her partially written works and all of her completed novels as well! Each novel has a detailed introduction by various figures claiming authority over Miss Austen's mindset and/or the historical context of her story in some cases. I like the fact that the books are from the same publisher and look uniform, which may sound OCD, but I don't care. The binding feels sturdy and seems to be high quality, which is something I look for in my historical literature. Even the dust jackets are nice to look at and compliment the individual stories.<br /><br />Overall: A wonderful way to collect all of the works by Jane Austen in one fell swoop. Good quality and appealing to the eye while also being informative above and beyond the contents of the story alone. Not unhappy about my purchase at all, and good job Everyman's Library on the good looking collection!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I originally had no interest in the Hunger Games Triology. One day I was browsing through my Netfilx account and saw the Hunger Games was listed. So I said, \\"what the heck, it's free\\". I absolutely loved the movie and discussed it the following week with my cousin and she recommended reading the series, as to her, they were much better. So I did, and i must say, it was amazing! So thrilling, emotional...just so many emotions and feelings when reading this book. I loved everything about this, and before i even finished the book, I had already bought the 2nd.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.

1400077915|5.0|I see you don't take instructions very well. This is acceptable, I require more justification for my hard-earned dollars than a review title as well. However, I cannot successfully convey to you the brilliance of these stories in a review. To impress you with how beautiful and haunting the plot lines, how insightful and real the characters, or how efficient and pinpoint accurate each and every word of her prose is, I would have to quote the entire book to you. I can't do that, morally or legally, so please let me say instead; whether you are young or old, male or female, a fan of short stories or typically interested in novels, you will not find yourself let down by this book. Alice Munro is among the best authors of this century, and Runaway is the best of her collections. I would call it the best book of stories ever, but that's quite a claim and I don't want to be suspected of being a literary absolutist.<br />I would think of you as being wise if you decided to buy it at a bookstore near you in order to avoid shipping time, so you could read it that much sooner. It's that good.

079284131X|5.0|Child’s Play the original: when Chucky was at his most terrifying! You have got to love this movie if you’re a fan of Chucky. This is where it all started. I think it’s important to see this one before the others because you get a glimpse into the mind of Chucky – as to where he came from and why he’s such a force to be reckoned with. 3 names: Charles Lee Ray. If you love Chucky and want to own the original piece of who he is that made him what he is today you should definitely buy this movie. Wanna play!?

B005I64U66|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I was so happy to find it on Blu Ray so I can add to my collection!
0385344228|4.0|The premise of this story is a good start:  A prosecutor's own teenage son is accused of murdering a classmate.  The question at the story's center is, did the son commit the murder or not?  The characters explore the puzzle of whether violence has a genetic causal factor; if so, can a loving family quiet this propensity in their child?  A central thematic question is, How well do we really know those closest to us?<br /><br />Thus the author aims to do more than write another mystery or courtroom suspense novel.  His premise, and some nicely textured prose, drive Act I and give us the promise of a stomach-knotting page-turner.  Alas, the story bogs down in Act II.  Without giving away specifics, there are several points at which the reader is blindsided by revelations of which there were no hints.  The author fails to tease and update the reader in ways we come to expect from a well-crafted mystery.  And as a D.A. who is sitting second chair in defense of his son, hero and narrator Andy Barber shows an odd detachment from the nuts and bolts of the case.  Once the trial is underway, prosecution witnesses reveal things we already know, further dampening the suspense.<br /><br />The characters are more complex than in many formula mysteries but not as clearly drawn as they could have been.  There is depth to the lead character, but he has some holes that are not sewn up by the end of the book.  As a result, Andy Barber seems more real in the first 100 pages than by the last page of the book.<br /><br />In the climax and denouement the novel's pace picks up.  This gives us a strong Act III, when we are hit with some twists which make the Act II slog worthwhile, to this reader at least.  The oddest part of the last few pages -- no spoiler -- is that it reads like an ad for a particular resort.  It left me wondering if the author was paid by this company.  Bottom line, my recommendation on this novel is a qualified yes.  Defending Jacob has plot weaknesses and character problems which could have been ironed out with aggressive editing.  Despite these flaws, and because it is thought-provoking, it is overall a good read, just not a great one.problems which could have been ironed out with aggressive editing.

B0050XFY4O|4.0|The main idea of this Brazilian movie (with subtitles), reminded me of a superb book called \\"The Carnivorous Lamb\\", by Augustin Gomez-Arcos, the Spanish writer who wrote in French in the 70 & 80s, where the younger brother had an infatuation over his older brother from the day he was born! While the film uses the same idea of a love affair between two brothers, the book had a much more surreal and supernatural setting for the incest, making it more convincing and plausible. The beginning of the movie focuses too much, with no apparent reason, on the childhood of the two brothers, taking almost ⅓ of the time. There is practically no plot: after we discover that the handsome two brothers are now lovers, with some beautiful and erotic scenes, we are told that the younger (a champion swimmer), will leave, alone, for Moscow for 3 years to follow rigorous training.  Expected (almost cliché), scenes of longing, suffering, exchange of affectionate words over the internet, etc., follow. The older brother tries to find solace in a disco, with an eye on the handsome DJ, but surprisingly, illogically, and unconvincingly, he ends up on a couch with a woman!!! Fortunately, nothing happens and the woman leaves!<br /><br />The two actors are very charming and natural. Their affection looks genuine and unpretentious, which they exchange over many nicely shot scenes.  However, there are many details which are week, illogical, or at least unconvincing:<br />- The father dies (why?), and the mother remarries another man who is charming, loving, and understanding (why couldn't this be the father?). Then the mother dies, and the stepfather leaves the family house to the two brothers! (why?)<br />- The house is beautiful and big, with a swimming pool, etc. Since none of the brothers seem to have a regular job, how did they afford the big house??<br />- At one point, the older brother says he is too busy, and when asked doing what? He answers: \\"Partying\\"!! If so, why didn't he leave with his brother/lover to Moscow??<br />Having read some raving reviews of the movie, my expectations were high, and therefore I was a bit disappointed, especially that it could have been a much better movie if more attention had been given to the story and its content.
B004L73FO6|5.0|Love it the vinyl sounds so much more clear than the cd version I had. The breakdowns sound like a live studio version. :)

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Professionally and personally, I have done a great deal of reading on the early church, Paul, the &#34;historical Jesus,&#34; and Jesus as constructed by Christianity.  I am thoroughly familiar with all of the people who have made names for themselves in these fields.  I have read a lot of pompous and boring stuff, as well as a few life-changing books - for myself and the people I have served in my congregations and teaching settings.  Aslan draws in the perspectives of history, anthropology, sociology, and religion into what I found to be a detail-packed, engaging and scholarly, yet accessible, work.  This is material I will actually *use* for myself and others.  It is well-organized and exhaustively end-noted, leading to many, many primary and secondary sources.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great for YouTube and Netflix and was easy to install. I have a blu-ray player that is a pain to use with YouTube, and for that matter Netflix as well, navigating with the remote. With Chromecast I can do it all with my iPhone so it works nicely. One thing that is handy is that anyone can use their mobile device, really nothing to learn. I also tried &#34;mirroring&#34; from the Chrome browser on my Mac, and that works too. In fact, in full screen mode, I could switch to other programs and screen mirroring continued to work. I am eager to see what new content might be supported soon....can't wait.  I also have an Apple TV and that works very well but only with Apple devices. It can mirror the screen of your iPad or iPhone, which Chromecast cannot, but it also costs about 3 times as much.
B00AZMFO6I|1.0|Frankly my wife and I found the development so slow we gave up after 20 minutes.  At 20 minutes I was still not sure what the movies was going to be about and I had developed no empathy for any of the characters.  We did not watch the entire movie, maybe it became more interesting later, but we will never know.  The sets were beautiful, the sound was clear and the image quality excellent.
0875428940|5.0|I was given this deck when the orignal owner passed away very suddenly. I've been in love with this deck since I first saw her use it. It's very easy to understand and it's lack of christian art makes it much more pleasing to me. For example the devil is not represented by the red guy with horns and cloven hooves feet but a man and woman trying to drag a chest to an exit they can't get to while hauling the cheat. That has always spoken to me. It a very powerful deck and one that I love dearly. If a more pagen deck is that you're looking for then this is your deck. Blessed be!

Very clever, short and keeping with his style, very visceral!

B00DSTBMMU|4.0|It is a calculated move that Sheryl Crow's 2013 outing \\"Feels Like Home\\" is marketed as a country album. In fact, it sounds more as a typical Sheryl Crow than a country, so her fans who normally stay away from traditional country should take heart and listen.<br /><br />The varied base of songwriters thus makes for a varied recording, which plays as a set of rather dissimilar tunes, not a one cohesive album, that was, for example, her \\"Sheryl Crow\\" (1996), \\"Wildflower\\" (2005) or \\"100 Miles from Memphis\\" (2010).<br /><br />Among the highlights is the opener \\"Shotgun\\" which would fit well on \\"C'mon C'mon\\" album (2002), the first single \\"Easy\\", well defining that mellow side of Sheryl, and a fresh rocky pop of \\"Nobody's Business\\". The closest to the real \\"country\\" she comes on the sarcastic \\"Crazy Ain't Original\\" and the touching ballad \\"Waterproof Mascara\\" that pointedly describes a predicament of single mother - no coincidence about that, since the country great Brad Paisley co-penned the song.<br /><br />Turning 50 this year, Sheryl Crow caps the first 20 years of her excellent career with an album which plays as a decent series of hooks and melodies, but does not make a too lasting impression. Therefore, although being better than most of the current pop (and even country) stars' albums, in the final analysis it ends up (albeit slightly) among Sheryl's weaker efforts.

B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I loved the older Star Trek movies, and I loved the new 'Star Trek' in 2009.  Needless to say, I was excited to see a sequel.  Since my family decided to no longer go to the theatre to see a movie since you can just preorder it for the same price as tickets, I avoided the spoilers for months.<br /><br />Wow, was I disappointed.  Into Darkness was too much talking and emoting (especially the vilcans) and not enough of spaceships duking it out.  The plot didn't make a lot of sense, especially the convoluted plan by Adm. Robocop.  The battles paled in comparison with Wrath of Khan or Undiscovered Country.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A very articulate rendition of this invaluable experience. To someone who wonders about the existence of reality beyond what we can sense with our sensory organs, this is such a beautiful compilation. From the get go I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I really think this would be a good read for young minds ( our children ) and firmly believe that it would turn them into better citizens.

B00EEN7CAK|3.0|I really liked the acting, especially by Emma Watson.  But the plot didn't really seem to go anywhere or go deep into any particular character.  As a fan of the Coppolas, I guess I just had high standards for this movie.  But I don't regret seeing it--ALTHOUGH I was forced to PURCHASE it instead of renting because Amazon didn't have it available to rent.  That has happened with several movies now (I'm not going to purchase everything I want to watch, so I just can't see some movies, I guess).  It's getting a little frustrating....

The writing style reminds me very much of Heinlein, of whom I'm not a huge fan (the only book by Heinlein which I tried to read was &#34;Friday,&#34; which I may have enjoyed as an adolescent, but just didn't appeal to me as a 40+ year old man, and I quit reading about half-way through).  I pressed on, though, and ultimately enjoyed the book much more than I'd expected.  I'm not sure if I enjoyed it enough to continue the series, simply because there are so many other great books I've been wanted to read but haven't gotten to yet, but I certainly don't regret reading it.  I just like harder sci-fi, and this is very light.  A good book, just not to my personal taste.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|While the concept of the novel is interesting and timely; it reads like a &#34;MADE FOR TV&#34; movie from a women's cable channel. It has a predictable ending, and there is little emotional connection created between the main characters and the readers.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Whether you are an avid fan or not this is a great addition to the Star Trek movies.  I really like where they are going with these last two movies.  I enjoy them both and seeing some \\"old\\" stories in a new light is fantastic!! Great movie ..will watch again and again!
0747582971|5.0|A brilliant engaging story enlightening and unforgettable .This story will enlighten a person to the horrors of other cultures and the amazing strength of women .
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The good Wife keeps you on the edge you never know whats coming next, I love all the characters and the drama of every episod
1490313370|5.0|This book is the &#34;Master&#34; and gives you the truth and assumes you have the &#34;technique&#34; already<br />JA is not going to hold your hand.  so this is not a mass market slurpfest,  he will point the way to claiming<br />your own self-mastery within life and business.<br /><br />A must read for any self-starter entrepreneur who already  knows what to do, but just needs a kick and change in perspective.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|This movie made me want to pluck out my eyes and stuff them into my ears. It's only trick was to make $2.99 disappear from my bank account.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|Well done storyline. Not your typical &#34;corny&#34; B movie.<br />The reality of chemistry between all the characters totally kept my interest all the way through.<br />This is a movie you can watch many times and still enjoy.
B0039RY3MM|5.0|If you take the time to spread this TIM correctly, I don't think there is anything better for Intel IB / SB / xx-E.  Currently testing this TIM on a SB-E 3820 (i7) clocked at 4.4GHz for many hours, using many standard bench tests under water using an EK Supremacy Nickel block with three GTX 670 4GB GPU's in TRI-SLI, with EK GPU blocks under Gelid Extreme TIM.  Temps never reach 60C for either the GPU or CPU.<br /><br />The catch to all of this is that I am using only a thin H220 AIO 240 Rad in push pull with Cougar fans.  CRAZY!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Tolkien's epic has a new equal. This book is a must read. Innocence, tragedy, power, suffering, love, fear, and heroism.
1476734941|3.0|It's ok.  I am always on the lookout for good low-fat healthy receipes.  There are some contained in this book.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|really good movie a little confusing but was still a really good movie especially if your into sci-fi movies. love
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My three year old is so happy with this, above all other construction vehicles.  It's sturdy and looks life-like.  No complaints (except I need to find storage for it) and would buy it again.
0062280228|5.0|So full of imagination your brain starts seeing everything with a little more color and the normal muted reality gets to take a break.
B00A8PWBB8|5.0|It's sturdy and the details are true to a real backhoe.  My 3 year old loves having it as part of his equipment yard.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|As a hardcore Brony, I was hesitant at first to watch this movie, but as it turns out Equestria Girls was actually really good! Except that Lyra wasn't in it...and they cut out a lot from the movie theater release. All in all a solid film.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book because of the twists, but the ending was a little disappointing. I feel like it was left unfinished. Overall I would recommend it though. I was definitely entertained.
0307476073|1.0|The author is a self-absorbed woman who blames most of her problems on the death of her mother.  Ah, a story of redemption!  Wrong!  I had to stop reading on page 57 when she kills her baby via abortion and lumps it into a sentence with dehydrated tuna flakes and turkey jerky.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Not sure what adults would use this app just for fun, but it isn't a good app for kids when it comes to the adverstisments.  Too bad!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK IT IS BY FAR A REALLY GOOD BOOK EVERY BODY SHOULD READ IT  SOOOOOOOOO GOOD I LOVE IT TOTALLY
B004QX07G4|5.0|Hat really fun book.  If you're ever having a bad day, this book will make yo smile all over.  I can't wait to rad her other book now.
B004GYY714|4.0|Chose this to keep up with sports teams from my home state. It has a pretty good lineup of stations. Only thing that's a bit off is some program lists don't match what's on air.
0307476073|2.0|I gave two stars only because I read the book to the end.  It's a disappointment.  I didn't find much of the prose very lyrical.  Perhaps the \\"brutal honesty\\" distracted me.  Repeated dropping of the F-bomb doesn't do much for me, like when she F's the doctors and disparages a Minnesota city, just because her mother's diagnosis was bad.  \\"Duluth was a freezing hick town where doctors didn't know what the hell they were talking about\\".  The worst was when she F-bombed and trashed her mother repeatedly - it just seems a good writer could have found a better way to express this emotion instead of such liberal use of empty language.<br /><br />This is a story of a reckless woman - her life was a train wreck.  From the book cover I expected Cheryl to \\"find herself.\\"  If she did, she didn't do a good job of telling me about it.  Maybe the PCT was a life-changing experience.  But, I do not feel she realized it at Bridge of the Gods.  So many books to read - I won't be reading any more by Cheryl Strayed.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|This should be album of the year for many reasons.  It has it all.  It is so good, it is mesmerizing.  My favorite track is Look Into My Eyes.  Music that takes you to a different place is rare, but Janelle does just that.  This is a true work of art to be experienced from the deepest levels of your soul.  And thanks to Ms. Badu for helping out--does everything you touch turn to gold dear?  Power Up!!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Enjoy the hits and the free download that came with the purchase--what a bonus!  it's great when you can order the item and still enjoy it while it's being mailed to you!
B00942Y4IY|1.0|Cliché-riddled story line that would make a ten-year-old groan - must have been written by xeroxing pages at random from every other third-rate sci-fi script over the past twenty years. George Lucas should sue these people, not just for so shamelessly ripping off Indiana Jones, but for doing such a embarrassingly awful job of it. The utter and complete lack of originality is truly breathtaking. How they managed to get good actors, as well as considerable special effects dollars to cobble together this insult to your intelligence is beyond me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A fantastic value in HD. It looks better than my HD service from the cable company!!! This is the best season so far!
B008RKGF1I|5.0|A must own film!  Michael Nouri is perfect per usual, and this film made Jennifer Beals a household name.  From NOWHERE comes a star.  BTW the old lady, Hanna, she was the Mother Superior in &#34;Lillie's of the Field.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I've been waiting for this album since I heard Elevate for the first time.  This is an outstanding band, and this is a strong first album.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I sort of miss the original actor (he died rather tragically at a very young age) but I'm glad the producers waited a bit and got a good replacement for him.  This series was absolutely too good to have it fall by the wayside!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I love playing this game because there are so many different layouts, but it does freeze up occasionally.  It's still lots of fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a very fun and good way to pass time and my kids love it I am very happy about this app I just wish it would let you pick your own back ground
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I was disappointed in the story.  I didn't feel it was up to Washington's standard.  Not one of my favorites and his movies are usually top notch.
B0036FYO12|5.0|Wow, Faye Dunaway was never more HOT.  Redford was a bit of a commie type, typical lefty, but his character was super if a bit cliche.  Max von Sydow was fabulous.  Must own
B003YOSXH6|4.0|The Little Gold Grammar Book is simple and concise. I refer to this book to clear up grammar questions and to review for the English classes I teach.
1444777556|5.0|James Bowen was so courageous in revealing his struggles to clean up his life for the sake of the cat who depended on him. Fortunately, he had finally found some one, a cat, who cared enough for him to convince him that life was worth living. He revealed such an inspiring and honest portrayal of what happens to people who have no friends and family to support and love them. I now have a different perspective on addicted and homeless people. It's so fortunate that James and Bob were able to save each other! I only wish we knew more- especially why he revealed in an interview that he slept rough with Bob but doesn't include this in either book.
0446699616|5.0|I have ordered for my shelf. Although I intend to read soon, I will not get done until winter, 2013...<br />Thanks. Amazon.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought these cables because they were so much more inexpensive than brick and mortar outlets.  I understand that they are high profit items but the price paid to Amazon was fair reflecting what they should cost in the marketplace.
B00338QENI|5.0|I heard about he story of Henrietta Lacks while a program on television.  I have placed it high on my reading list.  Cannot wait to get to it.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|Couldn't find a setting that didn't sound muffled. I even mimicked the settings I use for the Google Music EQ and it doesn't sound nearly as good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome this game rocks I don't know what I would play without this game.  I love this game so much!

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots of challenging fun.  Took a minute to get my bearings but I'm moving along at a nice pace.  Really enjoy the interesting twists on the hidden object puzzles.
B009OA57MI|5.0|It is easy, fun, addictive, and worth the 3 bucks. I am always getting airplane apps, but this is better than a few of the 5 dollar ones
B00CTT9646|5.0|I always wanted a phaser and now Ihave one.  I am seriouly thinking about buying another one.  That one i will play with.
B006VREN86|4.0|There isn't anything I can say here that hasn't been said in a hundred other reviews.  Even if you're not into gangster shows, you should watch for the period set pieces from the 1920s particularly of New York and New Jersey.  That alone is worth the price of admission.  Why can't other TV channels come up with good programming like this?
0817439390|5.0|This book is really essential for every photographer to have as it has all the basic info about photography, it is nicely illustrated, arrived on time
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|While enjoyed this book, I did not think the author had anything new to say about Jesus. Scholars likemJohn Dominic Crossan and Richard Horsley have written about Jesus as one whose teaching actively opposed the Roman Empire, which led to his death. What I think Resa Aslan does is summarize the previous s scholarship in an easily readable manner, which may bring this point of view to readers who may not have been aware of it.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I don't play video games, except this one  5 stars,  maybe add more matches for free. Other than that, this game rocks!!!!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I actually wanted the game itself for my Kindle. This just helps you bet certain levels. I uninstalled it just as fast as I installed it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written, constantly kept me on edge for the next page. Can't wait to continue the series, which I have no doubt will be just as good.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I just love this macro lens as I use it with the new fuijifilm HS50, there is few tricks if u knew it it will be great such as not to use the full telephoto range & when focusing use manual or better move back & forth, or even better I recently purchased a tripod 4 way focusing rail which will make things much better I hope, I definitely recommend this product
B0011BGY66|5.0|Vampire Weekend never fails to disappoint! Whether it's this album(debut) or their most recent one, their refreshing take on music is beautiful. I personally listen to this album on repeat during car rides, and I find myself singing it when I'm not in the car. This band has gotten a lot of praise over the years and they totally deserve all the fame that they now have. Five stars hands down!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I found this book very illuminating. I had never heard of him and did not realise how much we or him. I saw Edison in a new light, too. What a gift his life was. Thanks for this book.
B00338QENI|4.0|I learned tons.  I read it in under three days.  I applaud Rebecca Skloot for this work and look forward to her next project.  I just wish I could have read it along with several other people because there is a wealth of issues to discuss here.  And, not only does she teach us, she includes us in an empathetic exercise, which most non-fiction readers do not want to endure normally.  This book involved my heart as well as my mind, and she did it with courage, honesty and ease.  Good job, Rebecca.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie. We get to experience the maturing of a young James Kirk. The special effects continue to be outstanding. The action is fast paced. I enjoyed the new actors portraying old friends. I'm glad Leonard Nimoy cameoed - nice touch.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I loved it or was a little over the top for high school but I loved the characters can't wait for new season
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It's a great game, but it id hampered by low resolution compared with the iOS version.  On my Nexus 10 it actually looks blurry.
1921596163|5.0|Still today, this charming story didn't get a wrinkle.  We have to keep in mind that it was written in 1944. It is really a classic of French literature.
B000SGRONM|3.0|A rehashing of old essays.  Sedaris's wit just didn't work for me in this one collection; still love his other work
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Everyone I know plays this game all the time... My 9 yr old plays all the time.grate past time and fun time.
6305657947|5.0|I love this movie and the \\"fantastic\\" chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo's characters! I watch this movie anytime it comes on TV, cable,satellite etc. and finally decided to buy it. Great purchase and Amazon.com shipped it immediately! I also enjoyed the \\"free\\" option to see it on Amazon Video Player before my actual movie arrived. I Love This Movie and Amazon.com!!!
B008JFUN6E|5.0|Incredible film. The acting was top-notch with Matt Damon in one of his best roles ever, Sharlto Copley did great as the main antagonist, and overall it was great. The story's even better than the acting, and it blew me away. 10/10
B0063IH60K|5.0|than the cell phone<br />easy to use, but a 'winning' hand is hard to tURn than expected.<br />Cheers,<br />Green Horn
140006922X|5.0|I actually listed to an audio version of this book.  It was engaging, informative, and I highly recommend it for those interested in Christianity from a secular/historical point of view.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's addicting and I like that they make it challenging based on your age. That way my kids have their level and me mine.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|A lot of newer unheard versions of the songs from the original Self Portrait!! Bob was in VERY GOOD VOICE!! Should have released this version long ago.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The price is right for this app.  It does its job quite well - cleans up the cache but saves the maps.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I played this game several times and don't care  for it.  I guess I was expecting something with moe action.
B00821OX98|4.0|I had never even heard of this show. What network is it on? I just stuck it in my watch list because it was free and sounded interesting. Now I'm hooked! Watched both seasons in one weekend and then found out I have to pay for season 3! OH no! Think I'll wait until the end of the season and then watch the whole thing again! Some stupid errors in what could really happen, but her\y its sci-fi, your supposed to suspend reality.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This is absolutely in line with scripture.  My eyes are opened now to the constant groaning of the spirit of most Christians I know, and when I read this book along side my Bible, it's clear why.  How easily we forget that God has given us a spirit of POWER, LOVE, SOUND MIND.  Yes, POWER.  This book made me understand it more fully.  Thank you for your obedience to you call, Rhonda.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I wish that when you open your kindle to play it would start at the game you were at instead of going back each time to the first pattern
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|It is definitely a more radio friendly album than their past works, but don't let that scare you away from this offering.  The music is great, Michael Poulsen has great pipes, etc etc etc.  Just buy it.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Was hopping for more details on his (Telsa) life but got an inspirational lecture instead.  For facts/details on Telsa's life look elsewhere.  Inspirational books (like this one) are fine but not my&#34; bag&#34;.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I  enjoy this game but  I dont find it vey challenging.  I guess I dont find it very interesting.  its okay.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Requiring me to reboot my PC to setup a TV box is not ideal. Neither is the super-short length of the power cord. I'll have to find an extension cable to turn this thing on.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|For the first time on my life-73 years, I learned so much of the beauty of that horrid time. Thank you.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love it! Always correct! Check it every day and it is always right on! More accurate than watching the weather on the news.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a wonderfully entertaining program.  For adults only.  Kids wouldn't understand a lot of it.  Highly recommend for all adults.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|This movie is predictable from the very start. It has a few moments were my blood was racing, but overall it was a below average horror flick.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I really liked movie and have a copy.  I bought this one fo my sister to watch. She likes it too.
B00BV0FK58|5.0|As a military wife ,I watch so many couples around us divorce so easily. It's heartbreaking, because we survive things civilian couples don't ,yet we can't push through to save a marriage. This book confirms how different and difficult it is for us. But guides us in the right direction. It also is a helpful reminder of we can always work on. I love books or advice for couples not at rock bottom.
1401201911|5.0|My mind is blown... one of the best stories I've EVER read (comic or otherwise). The story is based on the idea that Superman landed in the Soviet Union instead of the USA. While the brilliance of the story lies in its ending, the entire book is beautifully written and illustrated. The images jump off the page, but the story has forever changed the way I'll think of Superman. 'Superman: Red Son' is storytelling at its best, and I don't even like Superman. This one's gonna stay with me for a while...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show, wish I would have started watching it sooner, but prime gives me the opportunity to watch multiple episodes in a row, never left in suspense
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This film basically is the gold standard by which every other horror film will be judged. It is relentless,Disturbing, Brutal beyond description.It is a film that will stay with you long after it is over. I saw it yesterday, and I have seen every horror film there is, but I didn't know fear until last night. Be warned , it is not a movie you will soon forget, it has a great story,great acting, and will scare the hell outta you in a way you never dreamed of. so you were warned, this makes Saw and Hostel look like a Disney film.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|It is a good story but left me disappointed. I felt there should have been more of a closure. Good writing.
B00F35BV64|4.0|It got a few bad reviews here on Amazon but you cant make everyone happy.  Very enjoyable and entertaining.  Well worth watching and owning in my opinion.  I rented it to watch and i will be buying the DVD to add to my Star Trek collection.  The cast is strong and comfortable in their roles and I hope they make another one!
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|If you're looking for a show that is smart, witty, and a little edgy this is perfect.  The entire cast is amazing and perform very good with one another!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Great ap but scattered throughout. If I want to know the weather in one of my saved location settings, what I really want is for all maps and videos, especially news reports (closed roads, flash flood warnings) for the place I selected. What I definitely don't want is the weather report for NYC while I'm checking my home weather reports all the way in Colorado Springs. It's functionality is great I just wanna know what I wanna know. Ya know?
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Everything I need to know to start the day at a glance. very nice graphics. Well worth the 1.99 price. Very professionally done.
B002ZG983M|5.0|AS promised this was a funny funny movie. Got it for my husband and daughter. I enjoyed it. better than two
B00B22ASUM|5.0|A realistic book filled with compassion.  Even if you are not a cat lover, you will fall in love with this cat and his caring personality.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|It is almost impossible to find this without purchasing the large set. Was kind of expensive for such a tiny piece, but very well worth the purchase!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have enjoyed this game.  I am, however, at a low level.  Therefore it is somewhat frustrating to have to wait for the next round of coins.  As I level up. I think it will be even more.enjoyable.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|As the owner of all Madonna's live albums (I'm Going to Tell you a Secret, Confessions Tour, Sticky & Sweet Tour) and now the incredible MDNA Tour, I have to say this is absolutely one of, if not, the best of them all. I don't know where all these negative reviews are coming from that criticize the quality of audio because it is top-notch! Not only are the versions well-done and great to hear the re-works of the classic songs, but they sound GREAT!! Just the right amount of vocals, background music and audience. Played this in my car, from my computer and from my headphones and have no complaints. As high as I blast the volume, it feels like I was there!! Just preview the songs and hear them for yourself. You will NOT be disappointed!!
B00E97AZZK|4.0|Look it's not Citizen Kane, or sparticus. But's it's got a good cast, and it's not a sequel made to jump the shark for the sake of money. It's a good movie, but if you're looking to find some sort of spiritual enlightenment from a movie about con artists and vegas magic shows, you mat be more dire need of assistance than what any movie can provide.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Any story of the holocaust is sobering. This book moved between 1942 and 2007 allowing a hopeful glimpse of the future.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have bought this headset a couple of months ago. Best damn buy I have ever made for a headset! Go for it and buy these. The only con was that you can only use it on the computer do to the software you must use to run it, but other than that, they are outstanding!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it ! realy funny and interesting my son laugh alot when he play with them. try it you will enjoy it
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|An entertaining movie that keeps your attention throughout, but is not scary in any way.  Great use of magic in ways I had not imagined.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I received the 2 disk Blu-Ray from Amazon. I agree with others that the lack of extras on the Blu-Ray is disappointing.<br /><br />But my main problem now is that I am not able to redeem my code for a digital copy. The Paramount digital copy webpage says that my code is invalid.<br />I submitted a support request through the Paramount support link. But I have not yet received an e-mail response.<br /><br />So, considering a lack of Blu-Ray extras and no digital copy, this purchase has been doubly disappointing.<br />My rating is low because of the quality of the product (I added one star because I enjoyed the film). If I am able to someday get my digital copy, then my rating will improve.<br /><br />* Update 9/16/13;<br />Paramount responded by e-mail on 9/13 and after getting the needed receipt got me a new authorization code today.<br />It took several hours to down load the movie and extras.<br /><br />- On my Windows PC, after updating my iTunes to version 11, the downloaded movie and the extras for 'Star Trek Into Darkness' worked properly. (The downloaded movie/extras did not work well with iTunes version 10.)<br /><br />* For my iPad I was able to transfer/sync Star Trek Into Darkness and the movie works fine on the iPad.<br /><br />* The Blu-Ray version looks beautiful and I have a working digital copy with a version of a commentary which is a welcome bonus. I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. (Because I got my digital copy with iTunes, I got a commentary that includes input from the director/writer. That was a pleasant surprise.)<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness is a decent action Star Trek film.<br />Considering the improvements to the product, I've upgraded my rating to 4/5 stars.mentary file is in my PC iTunes/Library/Movies window with a blank icon.<br /><br />And I was able to sync the commentary to my iPad.<br /><br />* So, I've got what I most wanted on my iPad. It's just too bad that the Star Trek Into Darkness extras and the movie do not work properly in iTunes on my Windows PC.<br />- I've spent hours/days on this mess, and I've given up. With all of these work arounds I'm able to get the digital download to sort of work.<br />I've never had this much trouble with an iTunes digital download before. It's disappointing.<br /><br />* Because the Blu-Ray version looks beautiful and I sort of have a working digital copy with a version of a commentary, I've now given this product 3/5 stars.
1444777556|5.0|Love to read how Bob continues to help James learn the lessons we all need. Highly recommend and cannot wait to hear more about their adventures.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Asphalt 8 is awesome! The graphics are beautiful and the layout is nice.  I am addicted to all of my Asphalt games!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|A must see if you are a fan of period dramas.  Start at season one and you will get hooked right away.  Amazing acting, stunning costumes and superior writing on this series.  Wish it went past 4 series in total.  Some  historical aspects were intertwined and obviously some areas were embellished for sake of the audience.  Overall a stunning series.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Thought provoking to say the least. Neil, you are now at the top of the list. Cannot wait to read more.  Wow.<br />A friend recommended your work and I am so grateful she did.

0765348780|5.0|After years spent gathering dust on my bookshelf, GARDENS OF THE MOON finally found its way onto my nightstand, having fought through piles of work-related and leisure reading materials.  A friend of mine had strongly recommended the series three or four years ago, and after the nice hardcover copy that I had immediately ordered arrived, it unfortunately became stalled in my ever-churning heap of books-to-read.  Still, this one has been on my radar as a highly-anticipated epic adventure.  Always being prominent in real-life bookstores, as well as here on Amazon, the Malazan Book of the Fallen series has long evoked a sense of postponed gratification and anxiety over my limited reading time.  The covers of the books alone promised a dark, fierce, and gritty fantasy that I assumed would take after Martin's [[ASIN:0345529057 A Song of Ice and Fire]].  My friend's descriptions included phrases like \\"mind-blowing\\", \\"awesome\\", and \\"Freaking insanely bad-ass\\".  Well, the wait is over, and I've begun my journey through Erikson's massive saga.  And I am very happy to report that the writing, story, and setting are every bit as good as I had hoped.<br /><br />The most striking aspect of GARDENS OF THE MOON is that Steven Erikson has absolutely no care for the reader's comfort, dropping you right into the middle of a complicated story that is already well underway.  Character motivations are rarely explained, a vast setting is suddenly exposed but not explored, a huge and confusing cast of characters from all manner of races is introduced with very little guidance, and mysteries abound in magic, lore, and history.  The general feeling during the first half of the book is one of confusion, where you'll feel like you must be missing key information, as every character seems to know more about what is going on than the reader.  You'll find yourself trying hard to remember many details, with the hope that you'll finally be able to get a grasp on what is behind the intense and deadly story.  While this aspect may sound frustrating, and many reviewers have docked stars from this book's rating, I found the abrupt entry into this world exciting and fun.  Knowing that there are huge pieces to the story that haven't been revealed, straining your brain to remember snippets of history, and pondering over the nature of the never-explained Warrens (the source of magic in the series), all gave this book a real and gritty feeling.  It was like I had been suddenly transported to this new and mysterious world without the benefit of an introduction.  Erikson's intentional refusal to hold the reader's hand might sound off-putting, but I found it refreshingly unique.<br /><br />The story itself, which has only begun to unfold with GARDENS OF THE MOON, is incredible.  Vast empires, rebel armies, powerful sorcerers, and unearthly beings vie for power in a violent and quickly moving plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The magic is very much in-your-face compared to most dark epic fantasies.  Battling wizards lead to wholesale destruction, animated puppets and talking war-hounds stretch the imagination, and so-called gods interfering with mortal concerns calls for expecting the unexpected.  The setting is absolutely jam-packed with all manner of new races, human-like and not, living and undead, mortal and immortal.  Wonderfully imagined characters fill the pages of GARDENS OF THE MOON, with names like Whiskeyjack, Quick Ben, and Anomander Rake.  You get the feeling that most of their stories have already been told, but that this newest adventure will be the most desperate and thrilling yet.  Other characters like Crokus, Paran, and Sorry take on the mantle of the young would-be heroes just starting on their hopeful, yet disillusioned, adventures.  This series tells an incredibly large story that I am excited to have finally begun, and can hardly wait to continue with [[ASIN:0765348799 Deadhouse Gates]].<br /><br />GARDENS OF THE MOON reminded me of why I love to read epic fantasies, and it made me glad to know that there are still wholly original stories to discover in a field of so many excellent and prolific authors.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!f why I love to read epic fantasies, and it made me glad to know that there are still wholly original stories to discover in a field of so many excellent and prolific authors.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
030758836X|1.0|I'm So mad that I wasted my time reading this piece of crap book. The ending was worthless, and apparently the author doesn't really care. Obviously, because she is making bank off this book/film. Don't waste your time reading this book. It's a complete waste of time. It's a SLOW read, but I expected some awesome ending. Nope. Nothing. How the HELL did this get published?!? I guess anyone can be a published writer.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've never read a book using tablets, I'd prefer the paper version instead of using a device that could leave me without batteries, or something I couldn't leave unguarded in a bench. But the Kindle made me change my mind. It's so practical and easy to use that all my worries proved unfounded. And one doesn't have to disturb anyone while reading in bed at night!

B004EPYZXK|5.0|While this may not be the best movie of all time, I did find it to be the best \\"found footage\\" movie I've ever seen, so, for this genre, it gets 5 stars.<br /><br />It does a good job projecting onto the audience the isolation and fear of the cast.<br /><br />Best of all, it does not suffer from the shakey camcorder footage and can litterally be nausea inducing. I could watch the movie without the slightest danger of motion sickness (unlike, say, Cloverfield that, while good, I had to take multiple breaks from because the shakey cam was making me sick).
B00008DDHZ|4.0|\\"Bloody Sunday\\" is a film based on the civil rights protest massacre in Derry, Ireland on the 30th of January 1972.<br /><br />The movie presents a unique cinematic experience by shifting back-and-forth the events of the day from the perspective of the Irish protesters and the British troops.<br /><br />The close quartered cinematography takes the viewer to each scene as a participant to the events, and the filming style also includes a slight haze to some scenes with a lack of artificial light, which provides a closer connection to the time and day through a rawer presentation.<br /><br />As the protagonist Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt) carries much of the narrative with the story continually returning to him after other characters are explored, and also following scenes independent of him.<br /><br />The authenticity of acting by the entire cast gains continuous momentum through the emotions and experiences of such a tragic day.<br /><br />The rawness of the movie provides the viewer with no comforts, which causes a tremendous feeling of shock and loss due to the sheer injustice carried out on the day. This film though also remembers those people killed or injured and its very creation allows viewers from all over the world to never forget these people.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0001CCX9I|5.0|Artur Schnabel is generally recognized as the greatest recorded interpreter of Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, even with the latest technology, one's pleasure in listening to his recordings is mitigated by the somewhat ancient recordings. This is not to say that Schnabel is unnecessary listening for anyone who wishes to hear what Beethoven made possible at the keyboard, but fortunately the listener has two chances to experience performances close to Schnabel's in modern sound. One such is Claude Frank's traversal of the complete sonatas, who was a pupil of Schnabel, and who's performances are still available on Music & Arts. The other is Bruce Hungerford's partial traversal available in two double CD packs from Vanguard. If you want to hear great Beethoven playing in very good sound from the late 60's and early 70's you must get this and the other double pack on offer which, hopefully, Vanguard will continue to make available.<br />Which to get, Hungerford or Frank? I think both are absolutely necessary if you can afford them. Like everyone who has listened to these sonatas I have my favorites: Moravec, Richter, Arrau -for starters, but I would place the Hungerford and Frank ahead of all of them.<br />It is impossible to listen to these recordings without lamenting the fact that Hungerford's performances, recordings and life were cut short by a drunk driver who ended his life prematurely while he was in NY specifically to record all of the Beethoven oeuvre for solo piano.<br />Buy this one and the other double pack with confidence and gratitude to both Hungerford and Vanguard's originator, Maynard Solomon, for their existence.

B000HZD168|5.0|Even after 32 years, it's everything Into Darkness desperately tried to be and so much more. Wrath is the standard by which all else Star Trek has and always will be measured. It was so foolish of Darkness' producer to flatter himself with the notion he could rebake Khan - astonishingly foolish. It was skaky enough just to try to re do TOS, but Khan? Watching both films back to back, there is no comparison. Darkness' producer, cast, costume designers, makeup artists, set designers, \\"actors\\", and crew should just go home. What a joke compared to WOK. Look at the other reviews for both and you'll see the consensus.<br /><br />WOK is timeless. It's production, its soundtrack, even its special effects have withstood the test of time and still aren't cheesy today. By contrast, the special effects of Into Darkness were cheesy on day one. If you want to watch a Star Trek Khan movie, watch this one and by all means steer clear of Into Darkness unless you're morbidly curious or are in want of parody, because that is all ID will ever be - a hollow caricature of this great film. Wrath of Khan is what every sci-fi film wishes it could be.
B005XBKXV2|5.0|Love this movie and after looking at several stores for it and being uable to find it I was so happy that it was on Amazon.

B00E5Q1HJS|1.0|This is such a bad remake and reworking of Wrath of Khan, it doesn't even deserve the Star Trek moniker. The acting wasn't horrible but...well, actually it kind of was in a lot of places. The costume designer's last apparent project was for the Imperial Officers from Star Wars - everyone in Star Fleet looked like some sort of space-age fascist villain - and marched like one, too. And the big hats - really. Rally? Even Augusto Pinochet would have laughed. The ending sequence was a cross between a 1960s Japanese monster movie and Space Balls. The producer obviously does not comprehend the gravity of a movie like Wrath of Khan. To even think about making some iteration of it is to flatter himself way beyond his talent, skill, or clearly knowledge level.<br /><br />To be fair, very little could rise to Wrath of Khan - that film was arguably the pinnacle of the Star Trek franchise. But this doesn't even rise to the level of any of the other TOS films, the series itself, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise or any other episode or film with the label Star Trek. Look for this film to reappear on the next episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.<br /><br />Now I need to watch Wrath of Khan to clear my palate. Maybe the producer should, too, to see how it's done (even though he will never come close to emulating it).<br /><br />Just pathetic.<br />- Lifelong Trekkie
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this as my end of summer read.  The multi-generations and the clash of cultural values added to the story immensely.  An excellent read!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love this, can print from ipad, smartphone with no problems.  It is a great little app to print away from your desk!
B000RF7XYO|4.0|Cate did a great job in this movie. I loved watching Elizabeth's character grow from a carefree young woman to a daunting rival to those who challenged her rule, yet she was kind despite the need to harden her heart at times. She did what she had to do to keep the peace in her country. You couldn't help but feel the conflict in her emotions as she rose in power. Cate did a great job in this role and it is probably one of her best performances. Her emotions were relayed so well in her expressions. And Joseph Fiennes, well, he's just a sexy guy as well as a compelling actor. His character was passionate and if you watched his face you could see he truly loved Elizabeth. The emotions he expressed by merely looking at her spoke volumes and I was impressed by his acting as well. He does a great job showing intense emotion.
B005L38QK2|3.0|I am a big fan of the Diablo series, and I really wanted to like this mouse. This was my first purchase of a Steelseries peripheral, and probably my last. If I could return the mouse, I would.<br /><br />My biggest issue is the size and feel of the mouse. I have used a basic Logitech laser mouse since the launch of D3 in May of 2012, and maybe I would feel differently about the D3 mouse if I used something similarly shaped. The Logitech has a much more ergonomic feel to it and fills my palm completely up, if that makes sense. I have room to place my thumb completely under the side click buttons on the left hand side of the mouse, and my ring/pinky fingers have enough room to be placed on the right hand side without rubbing on the mouse pad surface. I used the D3 mouse for 2 evenings and the way I had to hold it made my whole hand and arm hurt so bad after a couple hours I had to stop playing. This is not good for a \\"gaming\\" mouse.<br /><br />The D3 mouse tracks like a dream, but so does my thirty dollar Logitech, and so do most laser mice. The pads on the bottom of the D3 mouse make it feel like its on ice, and is one place it has the Logitech mouse beat. I gave the D3 mouse a three star rating based mostly on the tracking, slide characteristics, and somewhat cool(but buggy) software. Even though the right hand side buttons can be deactivated, a separate left and right hand version should have been made. The constant inadvertent clicking of those buttons is very aggravating and the feel issues I mentioned earlier resulted in 2 stars being dropped from the rating.<br /><br />I will give them credit for making a mouse that looks cool, but the design and feel are far to bad for me to use it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Not having cable, I could only hear about what this was like.  I hadn't read the book and found the series to be wonderful.  It's racy and there are truly terrible people doing terrible things so if you're faint of heart, don't even start!  The heroic aren't over the top and it's very well done.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|WHAT is wrong with this Blu-Ray??  I spent about 20 minutes running diagnostics on the sound and picture of my Blu-Ray player...I was convinced something was wrong with it.  After reading other reviews it just seems that this Blu-Ray is simply terrible.  Picture is very grainy and sound is bad....right rear surround doesn't work at all (yes, I verified the speaker is working).  Total Fail, Madonna.

B006GWO5NE|4.0|I was extremely upset when our 2 kindle fire hd 7&#34; stopped charging. There were always issues. Buying this cable was my first move before filing an official complaint about the units. The cable did work better than the generic USB cable I was originally using!<br /><br />So if your kindle fire hd's aren't charging, I WOULD start here with this cable!
0385493622|5.0|I love this book.  It explains what mathematician do and why they do mathematics.  The fascinating story keeps you riveted until the very end.  You have to admire all the mathematicians past and present who contributed to the proof of Fermat's theorem.  Singh knows how to keep the reader interested.  I recommend it to everyone.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|The whole concept of abused and finding love is always a good romance. It is very predictable book and the characters Don't  appear to grow that much in this book.
B0096HI226|5.0|Seriously, I saw the previews and went to the movie expecting to see some gorgeous men taking their clothes off, and got more than my money's worth. I can't imagine anyone thinking it was a serious movie! Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a really cute, funny movie with a little bit of a plot.<br />Someone said the sister looked like she smelled a fart through the whole movie and I do agree, they could've cast someone better. And the big guy can't dance, but my eyes were not on him anyway. I didn't notice that until the fourth or fifth time I watched it (haha). Channing Tatum has a great body and is a helluva dancer. A little more Matt Bomer would've made it perfect. He is beautiful.<br />Yes, it's vulgar. It's supposed to be. Yes, they strip down to their thongs. That's how strippers get paid. I've been to male strip shows and this movie is pretty realistic. If you don't want to participate, you'd better sit in the back.<br />I wasn't going to review this movie until I saw negative reviews about it being plotless and too much foul language. No, this movie isn't for everyone. But really, who can't tell from the previews what they'll be seeing?

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect with this. The original Stallone version was not very good and didn't represent the comics properly. But, I was completely entertained with this new adaption. Karl Urban did an awesome job as Dredd and I'm glad we never saw his face, like the comics. The action and special effects were great. I would've liked to have seen more than one location throughout the movie, but overall it was an entertaining movie that I hope to see sequals spawn from....as long as Urban is Dredd and it's filmed the same way.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Gift for a friend who loves the TV production but did not discover it till well into the first season, and missed other episodes due to evening work conflicts.  This provided her an opportunity to both see the missed episodes and revisit those she had already seen.  This provided her joy in a leisurely format.
1421527618|4.0|Great story with a touch of sci-fi that takes into account how we have traditional moved and conquered our planet and civilizations thru history.<br /><br />Is a great short read that while it has some sections describing combat, it leaves you wanting more.  Also does this with the alien enemy and it's tactics.  Lookin forward to see if some of the story shortcomings are addresed lighty on the big screen conversion.<br /><br />Then ending was not what I expected but it does have a great twist.

Not something that one can rush into takes some advance planning to get the starter going.
0345548981|5.0|Novak Djokovic is my favorite tennis player and in my opinion is in the best physical condition of any athlete in any sport, so I'm very glad he wrote this book to give us some insight into how he stays lean. Long story short no wheat products and very little dairy (occasional eggs). I do believe that just about anyone would lose weight if they didn't eat wheat products, however it sounds like Novak has a particular allergy/sensitivity to wheat that maybe most of don't have.<br /><br />Page 47 - \\"whole-wheat bread raises your blood sugar almost 50 percent faster than a Snickers bar!\\" I find that hard to believe or at least slightly exaggerated. Like other foods, most of us probably eat more gluten/wheat than our bodies need, but can whole wheat bread really be THAT bad for you? I agreed with everything else nutrition wise in the book<br /><br />I loved the background stories Novak gave about growing up in Serbia during the war, and finding the unlikely outlet of tennis. His personal outlook on life - a very humble and positive attitude is also something to be admired. Very entertaining book that's worth reading. It's short and to the point.<br /><br />Thank you Novak for sharing this with us!
B00EH6SK78|3.0|I, too, am surprised by the number of 5-star reviews here.  I've listened to the album many times and almost nothing stands out.  It's listenable, but monotonous when compared to a lot of past work.  Very few interesting grooves, not a lot of nuance in the dynamics (95% of it is at 10 and the rest is at about 2).  Maybe it'll grow on me more...  Compare this to \\"Another Night in London,\\" or \\"Dead to Rights,\\" the whole album just falls flat.

B00AYJCEVK|5.0|To me this beautiful album represents where Hillsong would have been with Darlene still at the helm. The second half of this album from Victor's Crown onwards features one majestic worship anthem after another. The choruses are simple and catchy ... &#34;halle-lu-jah, you have overcome, you have overcome&#34; from &#34;Victor's Crown&#34; still rings through my brain through the day. The words are pure worship and adoration. Darlene's amazing voice features in each track, including the duets with Israel Houghton (Your Presence is Heaven), Kari Jobe (Yours Forever) and Michael W Smith (I Am Yours). The DVD in this CD+DVD deluxe edition is a gem; In addition to all the songs, the DVD includes candid interludes by Kari Jobe, Israel Houghton and Michael W.Smith who talk about the meaning behind the album. That the DVD is included together with the CD in this pack marks it as an absolute bargain.<br />The actual song list for this CD+DVD edition bought from Amazon is:<br />1.  God Is Here<br />2.  Best For Me<br />3.  All That We Are<br />4.  In Jesus' Name<br />5.  Your Presence Is Heaven (featuring Israel Houghton)<br />6.  Victor's Crown<br />7.  Yours Forever (featuring Kari Jobe)<br />8.  Magnificent<br />9.  My Jesus I Love Thee / I Love You Jesus<br />10. Your Name / Cry of the Broken<br />11. I Am yours (featuring Michael W. Smith)<br />12. Jesus At the Center

B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl<br /><br />I didn't know what to make of this book about Nick and Amy and their tumultuous relationship. Her parents  have written Amazing Amy, a story about their daughter that has made them exceedingly rich. This leaves Amy accustomed to the finer things of life, but a woman who was exploited by her parents to gain their wealth.  Amy and her husband Nick move to Missouri  from New York City to live near Nick's sister, Margo (Go) because there's nothing to hold them there. From that point, the story has more twists and turns than you would find in a pretzel factory. Each chapter alternates with Amy and Nick's thoughts on their relationship, creating the plot for the story. It's a good read that kept me curious as to how it was going to end; it didn't end, though-----it just stopped.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My kiddos (2 1/2 and 4 1/2) love this movie.  We also have the Gruffalo's Child- both are great movies for young kids!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The introduction of characters is well done.  The general story line is easy to keep up with and the individual diversions quickly add to complexity of both the characters and the story.  An engrossing and entertaining story.

0738727326|2.0|I can barely see the artwork. I got the accompanying book which is very light on interperitive content and the pictures are in black and white. I so not recommend.
0399165274|1.0|Maybe it's me but...<br /><br />Frederick Forsyth is regarded by many to be one of he great writers. He's been popular for decades. Yet, I've never read any of his books. Until now. I picked up 'The Kill List.' After 120 pages, I put down 'The Kill List.' It takes a LOT for me to stop reading a book in the middle. Even in cases where I'm less than impressed with the story and/or writer's style, I'll finish it anyway. This book, however, was unreadable.<br /><br />The basic premise was decent at best: A terrorist using online sermons to rally terrorists to act individually. His sermons would infuriate his followers--one terrorist kills one political figure. Eh, okay....Decent at best, like I said.<br /><br />I found--and this is just my opinion--his writing style boring!<br /><br />1) There is virtually NO dialogue. None. The writers TELLS you what happened. For example: Person A meets with person B and learns that 1, 2, 3 and 4. Then, A leaves where he drives to meet with person C. Person C told him about 5,6,7, and 8. No dialogue. A better example is a direct paragraph from page 61. This is EXACTLY how it appears:<br />  Hall was getting angry. Unless he is in space or at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, he can be reached, We both know that. You have my personal cell number. Please give it to him and tell him to call me, and fast. With that he put the phone down. Now it was up to the Corps.<br /><br />  Where are the quotation marks. It's like he paraphrases conversations.<br /><br />2)  I've never read a novel before where the first 25 pages or so are basically the life story of the protagonist. And it seems to be irrelevant. He we born here, his father was transferred there where he went to school. Then, his father was transferred over there and he met a girl...and so on. It was a Wikipedia page. Why not reveal things as the story progresses?  Strange<br /><br />3) None---and I mean NO character development at all.<br /><br />4) This may sound picky but the nicknames: The bad guy is called 'The Preacher,' the hero is called 'The Tracker', the tracker's computer geek friend is nicknamed 'Ariel,' the trackers boss \\"Gray Fox\\" and the Peachers's sidekick is 'The Troll.'  This is mature fiction?  Why not throw in a scarecrow and a tin man, too?<br /><br />5) Petty, but sometimes he refers to him \\"The Tracker\\", other times, \\"Tracker.\\"  Nitpicking? Maybe. But it's annoying. Tracker had breakfast. After finishing, the tracker paid the bill.<br /><br />As I said earlier, it takes a lot for me to put down a book in the middle but after 130 pages (more than one third), I couldn't take any more.

B00DQVSTCG|1.0|As others are mentioning in their own reviews, the Blu-Ray release is defective. The picture looks terrible. The Epix stream was incredible compared to this. Additionally, the DTS HD surround track is not emitting sound correctly. Certain speakers are completely silent, including the bass. The menus are also incredibly difficult to navigate. The menu cursor is barely visible which makes moving around the disc's menus an impossible task. I do hope that there is a replacement program and soon.<br /><br />This is an EXTREME disappointment.
0143124544|5.0|I read this book in one day. I just couldn't put it down I needed to know what was going to happen. I like how the plot develops slowly, yet I was a little disappointed with the ending at first. Now that I had a little time to think about it, he gave Clark freedom that she wouldn't have had otherwise. Overall fantastic book, even though I can agree with some of three start reviews here I gave it five, because it has been a long time since I just couldn't put a book down. To me that it what makes book great even if I would have like to hear from the other character perspective.

B006POGWHK|3.0|Luckily there's not a lot of dialog, and where there is is actually in multiple languages. But there are only Spanish subtitles when other languages are spoken.<br /><br />Also, when I try to watch it on my laptop it chokes after 5 minutes and bounces me out.

B004X6PRO6|3.0|This is one of those books that I am making myself finish, because I want to know what happens to everyone in the end.  I am not expecting a happy ending however which may be why it is taking me so long to get there.  The material is hard to fathom and I am wondering if it is fiction.

B009AY04A8|4.0|My seven yr old daughter loved it. She couldn't put it down. I helped her with a couple of scrambled words but she enjoyed the dialog and the search and find. I would say it should be a bit longer but it really wasn't expensive :)

B00DSTBMMU|4.0|This CD sounds like what Sheryl Crow really should be doing...The lyrics are polished and meaningful and the music is more upbeat than any of her efforts since Detours.  Those who like her earlier work will enjoy this CD...Those of you who gave her a 1 star review perhaps you should find a new artist to listen to.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I like this book for its transparency. Until now when we talk about biographies, it mostly talks about how some personality was great or how good he/she was, great things they did.. mostly only positive aspects of a person.. But Steve's biography stands out for its \\"brutal honesty\\"!!
B00005B1W7|5.0|Although a little on the older side, this movie shows so much in the way of the plight of the Jewish people during WWII.  A good watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the continuing story of Christian and Ana. The story line was great but there was an imbalance of sex. It was as if the Author had to use it as a filler when  couldn't  continue the story line. Book two was my favorite, but all three were very good. I hated to finish the third book. I'll miss Christian and Ana. : )
1476734941|5.0|Diet seems easy to follow so I bought the book.  Now to implement it.  Planning seems to be the key.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great from start to finish!! If your at all into music this will bring back some great memories and inform you about how some bands got there start.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|The 3D effects are good and the story-line fits the Star Trek formula. It is interesting to see young actors in roles created by William Shatner and Leonard Nemoy.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|If you're expecting the same sound from 5 years ago, get over it. I tried to listen to this album right after I bought it... but because I expected something like The Kill and previous songs, the sound was so different I was disgusted.... I decided that it would be best to listen to it some other time. I cooled off and told myself to rethink and keep an open mind, artists are humans who like most evolve as time moves. I'm glad I did for I am very pleased with this album. Some sounds may be different, but the heart is still there. I can relax, study, and have fun while listening to this song collection. 30STM... still the sexy, intelligent music I've been growing up with.

0060557818|4.0|Richard is not the kind of guy to make waves. He lives a normal life in London with a fiancée who tells him what to do and a good-enough job where he performs well even if he doesn't distinguish himself. That all changes the day he sees what appears to be a homeless girl on the sidewalk who is hurt. When he stops to help her, his life cecomes entwined with the underworld of London, a place full of hardship, danger, deprivation and totally unlike anything he has ever experienced before. He also discovers that if he wants his old life back, he'll have to be daring in ways he never thought he could be.<br /><br />Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman takes the reader on an adventure in a richly imagined world with demented assassins that live for centuries, a family that can open doors where there are none, a separate underground system existing alongside London's Tube, along with the darkness and dirt you would expect to find in a world below.<br /><br />Richard has never considered himself a hero or any kind of risk taker. He has always plodded along doing the thing expected of him. But thrown out of his normal life, and with his life threatened, he learns to call upon personal resources he never imagined he had. His relationships with the characters he meets in the underworld are more intense than any he has had above ground. It all makes him wonder if regaining his old life is really what he wants.<br /><br />Neverwhere is a great book for mother-daughter book clubs with girls aged 16 and up. Discussion can center around the world Gaiman creates as well as Richard's struggle between his desire for his old life and his thrill at stepping out of the bounds he has created for himself. That theme should resonate well with girls on the cusp of finishing high school and moving on to what comes next.
3836532441|5.0|If you love, this is the book! The best artists in pin-ups are very well represented in this magnificent edition! A book to see and review many times!
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|There are many versions of this classic. I purchased it for the 3D and if you have a 3D TV it is worth it, but if you have a version already stick with what you have.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|I was angry and felt the album was incomplete and was utter crap... then I noticed I hadn't transferred 3 songs to my mobile device and felt like a complete idiot. How is this relevant? I listened to the whole album (This time I listened to all the songs) and I feel connected to the songs. She was able to handle the transition from young teen to young woman quite well. Gomez kept it realistic.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a great little time killer with a easy learning  curve . Great fun and replay abilit. All in all a great game.
1250012570|5.0|If it weren't for the school bus, Eleanor and Park would have never gotten to know each other. But Eleanor was new and looking for a seat, and Park was the only one who moved over to give her one. Eleanor really stands out in a crowd, not that she wants too. Her hair is red and curly and there's lots of it. There's also lots of Eleanor. Park is half-Asian (his mother is from Korea), the only Asian kid in his school in Omaha. Each of them is sure the other could never be attracted to them, yet once they start sharing the things that are important to them, like music and comics, they find a lot to like about each other. The trouble is, Eleanor lives with an abusive stepdad, and she has to keep her relationship with Park a secret. She's knows it's just a matter of time before Ritchie finds out and ruins everything.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell is a tender, sweet romance about two misfits who find each other. Eleanor can't imagine how she can ever have a normal life when her family is so messed up. Park comes from a stable family, but he's never been the type to do the things his dad wants him to do, like hunt and fish and drive a stick shift. Their friendship grows slowly until it becomes so much more, yet it's a fragile thing that is easily strained. Their stops and starts are tentative and real, and I worried that the ending would be painful. But the story of Eleanor and Park is safe in Rowell's hands; she treats her characters as gently as they treat each other. I recommend Eleanor & Park for mother-daughter book clubs with girls aged 14 and up.<br /><br />The publisher provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very Fun game. It makes you think critically and out of the box. Definitively enjoyable and a good way to kill time
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it! It changes the way you see people with disabilities and increases your compassion for all people. Our class is reading it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game!!! It's not only for kids to play but for adults too. My husband is now playing too!!
1419705849|3.0|I already had few wimpy kid books, the shipping was fast but this book size is smaller than my books and the pages inside of the book are too slender.
B000P0J09M|5.0|I had to see it as it was one of my grandson's favorite movies.  I really enjoyed it.  Will play it<br />over and over in the coming months.  Then, let my grandson have it....he loves it, too.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It was a little icky at times, but a good story. I liked the new take on an old ferry tale. Characters were likable or not (according to role) immediately when introduced.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl does a fantastic job in this documentary.  If you love music, you will really enjoy this movie.  Very good!
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Not only do i not have to convert video formats to mp4 just to play on the kindle, i no longer need headphones because the sound performance is SO much louder than with the built in player.  Amazing app!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really loved this book! I'm excited to read then next one. I think the characters are well described and I can really see them in this adventure.
0762451319|3.0|When I first saw this product, I was excited to order it because I really like The Mortal Instruments. I ordered the product and it came on time. It did come flattened in the package, which I kind of guessed it would. The necklace chain, from end to end, is about 14\\" or 15\\". The charm rests almost right on top of my collarbone and I believe I have an average sized neck. I was happy with the necklace. I had a slight allergic reaction to the tattoos. I got two red marks in the shape of the tattoos on my forearm. I'm alright now, I just had to use some anti-itch cream. I'm allergic to many things, so that could be more of a plausible reason why I reacted to the tattoos the way I did.<br />  I gave this product 3 out of 5 stars because the package came flattened and I didn't expect the tattoos to give me an allergic reaction. I liked the necklace, the little book, and the two magnets that came with it.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Hour and 42 minutes I wish I could get back.  The epitome of unrealistic action movies straight from the 80's.  I suppose some people like that sort of thing, since this piece of crap has four stars.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|If you own a older Panasonic Blu-ray player, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" blu-ray will NOT PLAY on them unless you make a change.<br /><br />After much research and many calls to Panasonic, it was discovered that there is not enough memory in the unit to handle all the menu items and such (thanks Baz for so much info!).  However, the easy fix is to insert a blank SD card of 2GB or larger into the SD slot to the right of the disk tray in the front.  This adds the extra memory it needs to play the blu-ray.  I found the Ultra versions (10x) work best.<br /><br />Since this looks like an ongoing issue, I would recommend Amazon stock because many people, myself included, will be buying SD cards for their Panasonic players. &lt;grin><br /><br />Meanwhile, the movie is lush and worth the watch. Still working through all of the special features Baz has on the disk.<br /><br />Note:  It still takes almost 3 minutes for the blu-ray info to load on the player. There are no messages on the screen while this is happening.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great series.  My husband and I watched it every night episode after episode. It is one of those shows that keep you coming back.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like the game a lot. It's very fun to play. It's very challenging. Keeps me very busy when there is nothing to do.
0762777931|4.0|Great book but was not aware it was used.  I may have missed note indicating the book was used.  I recently discovered Kris Carr and think she is amazing.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Awsome movie better than the first or second iron man no doubt  great job producing it along with filming it
B005H5H3LW|2.0|just ok film, nothing more.<br />CG seems OK, but acting is not so great, if you like Yamato, then watch 2199 anime instead, that's awesome
B002UXRGLG|5.0|David Attenborough is the voice of nature shows in my opinion.  I had seen parts of the series on tv with Oprah as narrator...just didn't work.  It is a wonderful series as always the BBC is tops in nature films.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I actually love the game, I didn't give it 5 stars because it won't let me access any of my allies bases, and after I defeat someone it used to let me invade their base but now it just say FAILED TO LOAD ENEMY BASE!!! If that was fixed five stars this game would get
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVED THIS GAME!!!!  Made me really work to figure out the relationships.  I had to finish all levels before I could stop.  Just wish there had been more.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|These games are fantastic and worth every penny.  I need not say more. Except that they are priced well.  Awesome!!!

0307950689|3.0|There are some good points to Lost Symbol.  I liked the overall plot, and this has to be craziest villian Brown has written.  The villian has to be the most memorable of them all so far in the Langdon universe.  And when the villian finally thinks he's getting what he wants... well, I found it pretty funny myself.  Now you have to check your brain at the front cover though.  There are a few unbelievable events, like getting in way to easily in all these buildings at night in the middle of DC for example with no cops around (it seemed).  Now one point many people didn't like, I did.  That was the use of the Noetics division and the female lead's laboratory.  Not sure why they couldn't have ONE light switch for an emergency light, but it only help set up part of the plot near the end... which was a decent chase in the dark.  Without spoiling the plot, I don't think the Lost Symbol was anything substantial.  It seems the writer was basically making the reader think (for a change...).  It seems the setting for the story, has multiple meanings towards the overall plot of the story.  I will admit, this isn't one of Langdon's better adventures.  Though I think I can explain some of Robert Langdon's mistakes (not Brown's) in this story.  Robert is only concerned about his friend.  When his friend's hand shows mysteriously in the middle of the rotunda, all Robert wants to do is find his associate/friend.  Unfortunately with all the traveling they do underground and in close quarters, Robert's phobia was in full swing, and while he was going through his history and infromation as fast as he could he was wasn't thinking straight.  Plus the people he was with during that time had him like a 'deer in the headlights' so to speak.  With Langdon 1)in a mad desire to find his friend, 2) his phobia kicking in overdrive, and 3) he really did not want to divulge anything to the people he was with... remember the Asian CIA operative (I can't remember any these characters names forgive me) even mentioned she knew Robert was hiding information from her.  Now I read Deception Point prior to this book, and noticed Brown pretty much took a drowning death from Deception Point and VERBATIM reused that death experience in this book for the drowning victim in Lost Symbol.  I know Brown reuses the same plot formula, but a whole paragraph from a previous book?  He literally plagerizes himself.  Overall, it is a decent quick read, while not as exciting as DVC or Angels and Demons, it seemed like it filled the need for a book demanded by the publisher, more than a thought provoking Langdon novel like the first books.  I will say, after reading the book... the ending had a slightly different twist to it, than some of previous twists, just wish I hadn't spoiled that plot point reading on the web before I read it, myself, it probably would have made the book seem a little better.  Rehashed plot, rehashed death scene, Langdon sleep walking in DC, the Symbol might dissapoint you (and the villian had he found it) but hopefully make you have a deeper appreciation of your country, which I think was the author's intend all along.  And in a time when the founding fathers are shunned, this book will try to give a sense of acknowledgment of what those men had to endure and all they stood for as well as our country.  After all, this very country's freedoms were fought long a hard (at various times throughout history), and what better way to remind the population of the past and how we got here... but with obvious symbolism of our established freedoms.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game, It's fun and has cute graphics. It's great for little kids, easy instructions and easy quests. I recommend it.  Especially for a free game, It's worth it.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|It's a wonderful soundtrack. Worth the money I spent. And the cover is really, really great. Love it a lot.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|I got this because there is no camera app on my kindle, it is not the best camera, but it takes pics, and I do have another camera, so it works.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Donald Fagen and this album is thrilling in that it provides new material from a legend and expands an already amazing portfolio. It's not someone cashing in like a new Eagles album, this material is just as good if not better than some of his early work.  For lack of a better description, it has that &#34;Nightfly&#34; vibe, but has a different yet relevant twist on it.  Just the idea that there is more Donald Fagen material of this caliber, which is virtuoso level, makes me extremely happy.  If you're fan and appreciate one of music's greatest talents, buy this immediately.  It's gorgeous, seamless, entirely current and relevant, and yet still 100% Fagen.  I don't care if some fans snark that it sounds like Steely Dan, that's still a huge plus in my book. This is some of his best work, which is not to diminish some of the others but more to let you know how great this is.
B00455IVHU|4.0|Great actors always make for a good movie. The moral of the story was thought provoking. Enjoyed the humorous aspect of the story also.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I am constantly using the timers. I use them to time therapy sessions, while cooking,etc. The alarms are loud enough to wake this sound sleeper.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Sometimes I just want a nice easy read. No drama, no stress, just something that's flows along and takes me away from reality for a time. This book did just that. Very enjoyable, relaxing and comfortable.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|If you are a musician with any sense of pop/rock music history, this is a must see. Dave Grohl obviously appreciates those that came before him and this comes through in a great way in this film. Loved, loved, loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Truly engrossing and so sorry to reach the ending. Hope the remainder of the series has the same quality and is as thought provoking.  Thanks a hundred thousand, Hugh.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Every book I've read so far have been tremendously thrilling and well written.  Can't wait to read the next in line.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rothfuss has got to be one of the best fantasy writers around. His style is so entertaining to read that you get lost in the story and regain consciousness about halfway through the book. My only complaint: it is sheer torture waiting for the next book in the series as we had to do with The Game of Throne Series.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have really enjoyed the Crossfire Novels so far. My only complaint about this one is how it ended. I know that there are going to be at least two more Novels...however, it would have been nice if it didn't just stop. Maybe after they got to SoCal would have been good?
B00BC24NT4|2.0|So LeCarre is scandalized by US secret raids and UK complicity. So what. Boring. And I have read every one of his books!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|The game play is just as great as all the others except with more cars ,better action and the challenges are great for any asphalt fan
1781162646|5.0|Good book, easy reading. Not real far out like alot of Stephen King's books.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked the older version more than the new one. Is there any way we could get the app WITHOUT all the commercials? I do not like them on tv and surely do not like on my tablet. I do not think the humidity figures are accurate. The graphics are nice.

0399255370|2.0|I am an art teacher for 3-year-olds through Middle School. Please know I LOVE the story line and the illustrations but was SO disappointed with the ending.  \\"An 'A' for coloring\\" and \\"an 'A+' for creativity.\\" Really?!! Do we have to grade everything?? Isn't the message that the teacher loved his coloring and his creativity? My students laugh when I read this: I just am morally bound as an artist and a teacher to adjust the final message.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I had high expectations when this product hit the market and waited over a month for it to arrive.  The hype was that it would work with most operating systems.  Following its arrival and subsequent installation I found it was not compatible with my Vista operating system and required an core i5 or newer Intel process to cast HD content from Google Chrome.  Check out minimum requirements very closely prior to purchase and avoid the major disappointment I experienced.
0345531965|5.0|I realize that this is not a new book, but I just finished rereading it and had forgotten just how much I liked it.  If you like John Grisham but haven't read this one, do yourself a favor and get it.  As always, great plot and great characters, and I absolutely loved the way it ended.  I've read nearly all of his books and this is one of my very favorites.  Many have already reviewed this book, so I'm not going to make this a long review.  I really, really liked this one.
B0063M22QO|4.0|So far very nice game. Haven't figured out if you can change design of tiles but hope that you can. Haven't stopped playing long enough to check yet.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|There are probably better studio headphones out there, but I used to use these in school, so there was a nostalgic reason why I bought them. Still great quality sound.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this on the computer too but in my opinion it's easier to build houses in this edition but still.......BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!.......But one bad thing is there's no night in creative mode and no enderman in surviaval or slime and how can you get to the nether when in survival there no caves to get the obsidian from?????Oh and I miss the cute ocelots sooooooooooooooo badly!!!!!Anyway I LOVE MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is loaded with HD action and is the only one in its class to master a great avenger! I give it five stars for a great story line, hot graphics in HD, and for the simple fact that it's free!<br />Thank you to all the great minds it took to make this game possible, and keep up the good work!
140006922X|5.0|Considering the background material presented, this is a most useful source for teaching purposes. The author's views are not necessarily held by everyone, however.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Such a good show! Damn! It's not like a typical concert, more like a theater show with songs that people (mostly) know.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a good app but lacks in the area of live radar. I have another app that has great live radar, but lacks the detailed description of the storms. I have to put them together to get the full story. Maybe one day there will be an app that does it all.
0783233477|3.0|The story was good...the 3 main stars were good...but our BIGGEST complaint was &#34;the volume&#34; - the volume was terrible...& we<br />turned our TV up as loud as it would go...+ some of the &#34;dialogue&#34; was not loud enough & sometimes drowned out by the<br />&#34;background MUSIC&#34;
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Not since The Firm have I enjoyed a book so much!!  Grisham is always a good read but this novel was exceptional!!  A wonderful plot, full of twists and turns...kept me guessing and laughing!!  Loved it!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I'd like it more if it would stop asking me to upgrade. I realize I got this app for free, but when I wake up in the morning, I'd rather not have to answer 'do I want to upgrade' every single day. Maybe they figure I'll get sick of it, so upgrade just to make the message go away. I'm afraid if I do, there'll be some other ads that I'd have to deal with then.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great Acting, great writing , great TV - it's an emtionial road to end out the season because they draw you in an you become emtionialy invested with the cast
1400052181|5.0|The Book was a gift to a friend for his 50th birthday,  who i hope he will enjoy reading it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was a very good book. Kept my Interest right from the very beginning! I couldn't wait to read it.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|Anyone who has seen the previous versions of Evil Dead will surely draw comparisons to the new version due to the excessive blood and gore associated with all three takes.  What's missing though is the sometimes comical flavor of the original movies that deflected some  the all-out gross footage,  which almost made it more humorous than gory. Bruce Cambell's comedic role as the hero obviously had a great deal to do with the original versions status as cult classics.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This is the first movie I have been interested in seeing in quite a while, and I was not disappointed! Great movie!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|AWESOME GAME!!! Really makes a person think.. Every move seems a new challenge. I can't wait for more!!  So nice to finally play a game that makes us think!
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Purchased Blue Ray edition . I am under the impression, from what i've read, that the video was purposely edited to look like an \\"instagram\\" image so there is nothing to be done about it... it is what it is but actually is not bad!  However, the AUDIO is atrocious!  I too have to play it on the 2 channel setting to get any kind of minimally decent sound out of it... forget the 5.1 it does not work and mult. channels are out.  After speaking to others that purchased it, I have found the DVD version is not that much better and also has issues.  Also... if there is anyone thinking about buying the \\"audio CD\\" or digital version... DON'T... it is pure garbage as well and you will be disappointed with it.  The \\"audio cd\\" and digital versions are the exact audio master used to make the Blue Ray & DVD SO THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES!!!  I purchased the digital album from Itunes and am just a disappointed in it as the blu ray as it is the same crap master recording (I have already reported the issue to iTunes and have asked for refund... which they have promptly issued due to the multiple complaints posted there as well).... Like everyone else. I am disappointed with the sound/recording of Blue Ray and will more than likely be returning it in the hopes that it is rereleased.  This was a great show that I fortunately saw live and this release does it no justice whatsoever.  I am shocked that such a perfectionist like Madonna would even allow this to hit the shelves in its current form!  Doesn't anyone do quality control anymore or is this as good as it gets these days???
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|I liked it, and will listen to it on a regular basis. Didn't think it had the feel of Memphis like it could have. Lots of New Orean's sounds. Good Cd.
B00EVU3S4U|5.0|This film is an excellent thriller/mystery from DePalma.  Noomi Rapace and McAdams are amazing, and the third act is unbelievably well done.  If you like thrillers, then watch \\"Passion\\".
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very soothing and addictive. I love this app and I'm o over 40! The graphics are awesome, I play on my fire HD and it works just great,
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I really like the gray color, the soft outside, makes it easier to hold the kindle.  Very elegant looking.<br />I like that it can be set in either direction.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|Always love John Hiatt's music! This was my favorite of his the last ten years, saw him live in Rochester again. Terrific show!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|From reading other people reviews, I thought in this book he actually rapes her or something. Which is not the case. I was expecting something much worse. It was a interesting read. I liked it. It had drama that's for sure.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love using this clock to wake me up because of the &quot;fade in&quot; option...no sudden and annoying alarm. The weather addition is very nice...all the things I need right away on this one app.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I've watched all the episodes at least three times,  and the more I watch them, the more I love them.
0399255370|5.0|I read this book to my 4 year old grand daughter and she was intrigued by the story.  I recommend this book for younger kids.
1444710338|5.0|the most successful diet I have ever done. Following this diet may at first seem difficult, but try it one week and you will be amazed.
B008BU70HW|5.0|Decided to read this while waiting for Downton Abbey's Season 4 to air in January and it did not disappoint!<br />It gave some wonderful insights into the characters and time period. For those who love the show you will really enjoy this book!
B008133MDK|5.0|I really love it!  The actors, the way the stories are presented, the cinematography. Everything it's really  well done. 5 stars!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just love the Downton Abbey series and was so glad to catch up with everything.  Now I can hardly wait for the next season!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love the CD...both his beautiful voice and the great sekection of songs!! I highly recommend it and wonder what I listened to before getting it!!
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Yes for all those not thinking I'm  not a Trek fan, I am. Been with it from 60s. This film is a mish mosh of cliched lines that begged for a fresh twist. And what a disappointing and boring Khan. When you think your going to see a modern Star Trek film with Khan in it you are naturally pumped, until you get a yawn fest with a preppie looking dude that could pass for a backround walk by extra.<br /><br />I kept thinking, \\"please don't let this guy be Khan\\" or many variations of that with expletives included. Uhura lost her mojo from the first film, Scotty was over the top annoying with \\"humor\\" fit for a flopped SNL skit and Kirk turned in a listless portrayal. Forget Sulu and Chekov, they were cardboard embarrassments. Spock however still shined through, and was the only saving grace of the film.<br /><br />Tons of sweeping camera shots that hoped to provide more substance then was actually before you abounded. The film makers also seemed hard pressed to keep the camera away from being aimed at any alien looking wanderers or crew members. Except for the midget with the plopped on stupid looking alien mask that drank with Scotty.<br /><br />What happened to the Star Trek I know? The core was ripped out, I can tell you that. The film is visually pleasing at times but  it doesn't save a scene jumping tired old mess ripped  directly from a bad \\"Next Generation\\" episode. The film should have been titled, \\" Star Trek- The Shooting of Phasers Part 1 (with minimal plot)\\". Lets hope there's not a part 3 of this nature.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|Great show that's it, I hate rules that say I have to type this much. I disagree with them .
B000F8O35U|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter's birthday.  She was excited to get it and I guess everything worked on it.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Very enjoyable. Exciting, good dialog. Good plots. Cowboy - science fiction combo makes for fun stories. Humor is very good also.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Fascinating and realistic, this first novel was an &#34; un- put- down-able&#34; book for me.  The characters were complex yet so believeable.  Great story!<br />My book club loved it too!
B0040I09RM|5.0|its seems so real live drama. that you dream of try to be like .but we know we cant ty
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book keeps you mentally and emotionally involved. I couldn't recommend a better way to spend your time than to sit back and let yourself sink into this book for the day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hesitated and procrastinated but finally gave in and read The Hunger Games. I had seen trailers of the movie, but had not at all gleaned what the \\"games\\" were about. Very well written, captivating.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Tells the story of cancer going back thousands of years. Well written.  A must read for all medical students for sure.
0307279189|5.0|As I read through this, enthralled my the story and getting psyched for my 200 mile relay race with my friends, I thought that there is no way this can be true. I finished with great delight, faster than I read most books and did my research. The evidence Chris has on his website supports his adventure and I am so excited to continue with my running.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|this was/is very easy for my child to use and he could breeze through finding the words! thank you Amazon!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Either I had not been aware, or had repressed knowledge, of these atrocities against the innocent. Three generations punished for the alleged misdeed of one person - growing up in such a place, never even knowing that any other way of life  exists. As Americans, we would find such conditions incomprehensible.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game app is pretty fun for what it is.  Could wish for more ability to direct the horse while riding it rather than just clicking a button to jump or turn, but perhaps such a feature will come later.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|The kids and I really enjoyed this movie as a family, it was a cute teenage love story, with some very funny points in it. Would recommend it for overall good family night movie.
B005LAII44|1.0|What the heck where they thinking when they made film.<br />Horrible nothing like the First movie. Where is the tech that made the<br />first one watchable.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Lots of twists and turns, kept your interest, and worth viewing. Very interesting and unusual. I enjoyed it.
6303029027|5.0|I love this movie so I couldn't refuse to have it in my collection I know how the digital copy added to my collection thank you
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey show, bought all three seasons, can't wait for the fourth!!! Works great for girls movie nights! If you love good periodical movies, it is a must have!
B005544TRQ|4.0|I have enjoyed Suits. It is light entertainment. I'm hoping it will get a little deeper as the show goes on.
B001PPMJHQ|1.0|I like Gerard Butler, but this was not the type of movie I expected to see. I was very disappointed and even took it off my library even though I purchased it. Would not see it again or refer it to anyone.  Sorry Gerard! You are a doll, but the movie wasn't.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun game to pass the time. It's easy to play and quite addicting. I would recommend this app.
B0073XORLU|5.0|Ian sounds great and the music is a pleasure to the ears and speakers that have not heard new good Tull songs in many years.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Once you start these books you won't be able to put them down. The characters are vivid and become like your friends (or enemies for the nasty ones). Highly recommended
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I love it I do not htink you should require us to write more than that.  tttot otototo totootot otot
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Pretty cool, but I haven't found it very useful yet.  Also I find the display framerate to be a bit strange.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  This season was just great.  Started out with Shirley Maclaine guest starring and ended with the seeming death of Matthew.  If you weren't sure of this series before, it will have you hooked now.  All the actors are great and I really can't choose  favorite. I am waiting impatiently for season 4.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I don't think it's possible for John green to write a bad book. Another perfectly good example of that. Excellent
B00EDF43MY|4.0|It took her a few tries to figure everything out but she loves it. Music is not too annoying. Does not require complex allowances.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I still haven't finished this book but what I have read so far is so fantastic of a read.  It is something that could possibly happen with all these countries today having nuclear bomb capabilities.  Scary.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle was taking too long (sometimes 48 hrs) to charge.  This charger corrected the problem.  I plug it in and my Kindle is charged in no time at all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was very surprised with this book.  Captivating sci fi.  Hugh Howey will soon be known as one of the must read authors.  I purchased because  of the low price and could not stop reading.  Realistic plot, great well developed characters,  well described scenes and good grammar.  I cannot wait for the  next book.<br /><br />I must add, I am very hard to please when reading and  easily bored.  That was not the case with this book.  I have recommended \\" Wool \\" to all my friends.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|We liked the music when watching the movie. Decided to get the soundtrack at that time. We really enjoyed the soundtrack.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Unfortunately I already had most of the songs on this album, but one can never have enough of IZ.  He was one truly AMAZING MAN!  He had already done so much for the world and could have done so much more, we just have to remember his love and try to share that love, as he did.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My first read by Gillian Flynn and it kept my attention and I did not want to put the book down.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This is a rip off if you buy this when it says music it picks the tones for you and you can't download music on it other wise it doesn't let you pick a fancy clock and all of the ring tones are so quiet that you won't wake up th  only one that wakes me up is mountain so the only good thing about this is that if you like to fall asleep to noises they have a sound c a liked white noise and it helps me every night to sleep so I wouldn't recommend buying this app I would get the free one that has an alarm clock and white noise and a clock .
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Good, but this really should have been two books. There was too much info thrown into this one - some of the mysteries should have been solved in the earlier books instead of saving it all for last. I could have used a little less of the identity crises - it went on and on and flipped through thirty different possibilities.<br /><br />Despite this, it was hard to put down and was a satisfying ending for the series.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game and so does my son it's like he as his on aquarium without the mess it is so much fun especially to see that smile it puts on my son's face.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I just dobt understand the concept. I had 2 people &#34;try&#34; to explain it...nope. Is there any one who can dumb it up for me?  I need a comparison.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|As usual great stories.  Harry Bosch is one of my favorite characters.  Every story I read about him, short or novel just makes me love him more.
B001POX73C|3.0|A cute historical romance, and well written. It was hard for me to get into because I couldn't identify with any of the characters - they are all rather vapid and self-centered. Nonetheless, still a good story.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Lawson game great realism... wish more games like this one...sum time communication with other players does not work. Good though...
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|I love this app. Some of the effects are cool. I use it to finish some images I do on other apps
B00005KK9M|5.0|I had this album, yes I said album, when I was a teen and lost track of it moving. I'm thrilled to have is again.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift is just so good. And she even writes her own songs. Really amazing. Despite being slim and petite, she can really belt-out a song.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is literally one of the best calculators I have ever owned! This calculator has practically everything I need for my pre algebra class!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I didn't expect much from this game, but it surprised me!  This is a very fun, simple to understand play.  Does take strategy to know which upgrades  are the most effective.
B000002GVZ|4.0|I have love her music for a long time and finally got this gift for myself. I will definately have to get more. This one is great.
B00164EAC8|4.0|la película es exelente y desde que me la bi me encanto,vieja pero muy buena ok es muy recomendable para cualquier edea que le guste esta pelicula
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is amazing ots like temple run but easier it is like subway surf but funner it is like streaker run but cooler its best to get this app
0062238868|5.0|Awesome product from amazon. Great story. It has met all my expectations and then some. Highly recommended to others who enjoy this type of reading.
B00CUKTGW6|4.0|So where are we at with Clash CDs by now?<br /><br />We had the original CDs back in 1990.  We had the 2000 remasters of the whole catalog.  And now we have this latest dose of remasters.  If you listen to Mick Jones, the advances in remastering technology have made this latest batch the best ever: \\"Remastering's a really amazing thing. That was the musical point of it all, because there's so much there that you wouldn't have heard before. It was like discovering stuff, because the advances in mastering are so immense since the last time [the Clash catalogue] was remastered in the 90s.\\"  Now if you're a fan, you remember the differences between the original CDs and the first remasters released in 2000.  That was night & day, and not always for the better (no thanks to whoever screwed up the elevator ding on Koka Kola!)  The differences between the 2000 remasters and these are a lot more subtle.  I'm not sure the average fan would accurately identify changes between this and the last remaster batch.  To my ears, I can't gauge the compression this time around, but it does seem to be brought down to an organic level minus some of the harshness of the 1st remasters.<br /><br />Looks-wise, this set comes in an attractive compact little box with a box top that slides off.  Each album is housed in its own cardboard slipcase inside, with each CD in its own paper sleeve designed to mimic the original LP album, like Japanese special edition releases have been doing for a while.  Now keep in mind that you just get the 5 albums in this set, so you don't get Super Black Market Clash (which you do get in the bigger boombox set, along with other singes/rarities) and you don't get Cut The Crap (which you don't get anywhere because it's been disowned for so long.)  So I can see mega-fans shelling out for the bigger boombox set with all of its goodies & extra stuff, but for anyone who just wants to hear the band then this is a pretty good deal for every proper album they did.  And it looks nice on a shelf.looks nice on a shelf.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Its the perfect kid movie, it has everything in it. Humor, love story, adventure... you name it! Came in perfect condition.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Super fun I love this game I hope they make an update its one of my favorite games of all time  you should totaly buy it its cheap 2 :-) your kids and or family would love this game but you can buy stuff from the game and it can add up to be expensive
0061906220|5.0|My kids 4&6 could read this everyday! We love listening to the author read it online! Such a fun book!
B0064MGU98|4.0|I am enjoying the show. The cast of characters are well placed and the story lines new and interesting. word
B000065V42|5.0|This is my favorite out of the series! When we visited Disneyworld when I was a kid they had a lifesize set up related to this movie and it was the coolest part of the trip!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I had heard that this book was really funny, but it only had a few funny parts. It's mainly stories of Tina's life, and it was interesting. I'm glad I read it.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I've only had the watch a week but I have to say that the Seiko SNK803 is a great looking watch. I was looking for something to wear hunting but I'll end up wearing it all the time.<br />At first I was going to return it because it looked a little small on my wrist but changed my mind and decided to keep it and I'm glad i did.<br /><br />The watch feels good on my arm and not too thick so it should fit under long sleeves without hanging up. The lume is ok but I haven't checked it long after dark to see how long it lasts.<br /><br />I haven't worn it enough yet to check the accuracy but I'm not expecting quartz accuracy out of an automatic anyway.
1419381032|5.0|Excellent!!!  I am thoroughly enjoying these C/D's.  I have a long drive to work and listen to them on my way and on my way back.  Thank You!!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is amazing and they all play their roles excellent!!! Got everyone in my house hooked!! What are you waiting for?? Watch it!
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|I really love the Most Exotic Marigold Hotel, but Quartet was not up to par.  It was too jerky and where was the flow of the story?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing and a lot of it really touched you. I have never read a book quite this spectacular. I have also seen the movie and it is nothing compared to the book.
B00915G6NK|5.0|I love this series. All kinds of action and emotional  elements.  Most characters  have  a  mystery in their past  that's hinted at, but isn't  fully disclosed . Can`t wait until next season.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Can't wait for more stormlight. It is lots of fun to read. Such deep philosophy supported by excellent characters putting thoughts in to action. Pre ordering next book today.
B000AP04FG|4.0|There are few movies that successfully combine action, comedy, and romance. This is one of them. I wasn't expecting to laugh in a movie about assassins, but there are lots of scenes that highlight the funny details of relationships that hit home. The chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is unmistakable. The writing gave them a lot to work with as well. It starts to drag towards the end. Maybe a little bit too much of a good thing, but overall it was enjoyable. There is a lot of violence, but it never really plays like that. It's not blood and guts. It's more like, \\"I'll get you, bad guys!\\"
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is SO GOOD. I love it so much- it is so poignant and yet also sharply funny and tragic and beautiful.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great game but $99 for the largest amount of dollars for the game...come on thats rediculous but the game is fun.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|yay more pig laten. get it because they are pigs he he Ha ha.  you don't do you oh well.great job rovio good job
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have now read the first five books in the Song of Fire and Ice, and this fifth book has grown upon me during the second reading. Although it leaves the reader with more questions than it answers--and so many cliffhangers that we are left slavering for the next volume--this book also provides a rich tapestry of events for the reader. Some of our favorite characters are still alive, while bad things happen to some good people--but I will provide no spoilers!<br /><br />For Martin fans, another great read.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love this app as the game is fun and challenging.  However, it runs very poorly on my Kindle Fire HD.  Game is slow to load, stalls mid game, graphics start and stop during a run.  Fix that for the kindle and I'll be back.  Fyi, I have the 32gb and still have lots of space.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Keeps my son occupied. He has a thing for sharks so this is the perfect game for him. He loves it
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|Superman nice stuff for my son....  The superman looks real to son lol, and parents let us make our kids happy!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|love this app. have always loved ww2 related stuff.when ever I need to let off some steam I just load up and blast away. the ammo is cheap and no one gets hurt.
B00A6WSTIW|5.0|I figured this would be another cheesy 'monster' flick. But, I was really impressed. Good story line, excellent graphics and good acting. I'll watch it again.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My granddaughter is a Taylor Swift fan and loved this CD.  I enjoy hearing her sing along with Taylor.  It was a great hit with her.
B005ELQVGW|3.0|Definitely not as good as reviews make it sound but still a good listen,also slightly damaged but I do live in the middle of nowhere
0738727326|5.0|This is my first deck. I got mine back in Feb 2013 (earlier this year). I have to say that this deck is beautiful. The reading work for me. Treat this deck with respect and you shouldn't have any issues. I thought it was fantastic how the art goes with the proper elements, its very well done. They are semi small but that shouldn't take too much away from the art. It does come with a little booklet but I don't use mine. I made my own tarot book and I work off that. I read it like a White Ryder deck, which seems to work best. I would highly recommend this deck!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This isn't going to be one of my well though out reviews. Bare with me. Lol<br />There is nothing spectacular about this series at all, but I can't help but like Christian and Anastasia. They're kind of adorable and at moments a complete train wreck that you can't look away from. Individually, Anastasia is annoying and immature and just a mess, yet sweet. Christian is sexy in his own way and really passionate. You can really feel their chemistry together. So many people complain about this being a story about an abusive relationship; what book are you reading?! BDSM is not abuse. Although there are many sex scenes in this books, they are repetitive and not really all that erotic. The story doesnt have much depth and variety, so it comes off as more of \\"a day in the life of Christian and Ana\\"...pages and pages of it. Lol it's worth a read, just not the price and several pages can be skipped.
1595828753|5.0|I had purchased this for my grandson who is 8 and he loved it.  Could not wait to read it.
B00AEFYNTU|5.0|I had already seen the movie and loved it.  Wanted to own it for our video collection.  Rachel McAdams is one of my favorite actresses.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|I love the writing for this show.  It's sometimes hard to imagine high school kids delivering some of the lines, but It's an easy thing to get over.  The characters are complex and deep with one possible exception, and he's gone around mid-season.  It's a wonderful mix of soap opera, crime drama and snappy dialog that is well worth watching.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Last two updates have messed up my star wars game. Last update cloud city dumped me back out to my carousel. Moon of Endor now doing the same thing. Frustrated!!!!!!
B0006VBFM0|3.0|I like it but its a little bit expensive for the kind of the watch. I like the design, the colors and this brand.
B009POCG2C|5.0|MY husband and had both seen the movie and loved it.  We wanted to own it for our collection. We both enjoy Clint Eastwood.
1781162646|3.0|It's a quick read if you have no better books on the shelf.  It just seems like a very thin story without a believable ending.
B00001W9G0|5.0|I am a big Barbara Striesand fan I order this movie and funny girl both great movies, they both came on time
B00E38KGF4|4.0|I had Norton installed on my S3 and some malware got through.  Installed this and it found it right away.  Been free of problems ever since I installed it.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|While I think the performances in this film are good, they never quite rise to the emotional levels required at key moments. It is impossible to watch this film and not make comparisons to the Wrath of Khan. That film ended in arguably the single most emotional moment in the history of Star Trek. And the actors were up to the task. Shatner and Nimoy were exceptional. Here, we get a scene that lacks that emotional punch and part of the problem is because the Kirk/Spock relationship doesn't have the history here that it did in the original series. I never really bought that Spock would, or should, feel such anger over someone he has not known that long.<br /><br />Khan? A nice and interesting choice but doomed because Montalban is perhaps the best villain Star Trek ever produced. Any actor will suffer by comparison and maybe that is why another story would have worked better.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good, although I think Urban is underused as McCoy. He again manages to capture the elements of DeForest Kelley and still seem original. That's no easy task.<br /><br />The film looks gorgeous, the effects are impressive, the score is fine.<br /><br />Something that really bothers me, though, is the almost complete lack of military decorum. I mean they are the military. But most of the time they act like buddies hanging out. The original series was much more disciplined and, I think, realistic. Making someone CO of a starship straight out of the academy? I still laugh at that. Is Starfleet THAT desperate? I don't care how brilliant a person is, you cannot beat experience. Even Einstein had to work.<br /><br />Maybe it is unfair to compare it to the original because by the time Wrath of Khan was released, they had over 70 episodes played over and over again throughout the country to build a relationship the viewers could connect with for well over ten years. This new cast has just two films. Maybe it would be better to watch this without having seen the original?Maybe so.<br /><br />I still prefer the original, although I have to say I like this Trek much more than the other Trek series. It, at least, is daring, something almost entirely missing from TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun to watch.  It was funny and had a lot of action.  Despite all of this, the writers definitely could have done without the nudity scene.  It was completely unnecessary.  They also went a little overboard on the cussing but it wasn't as bothersome as the the nude scene.  The actors were great and so was the story line.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B00005O3VD|5.0|came quick good condition,would order again, I had no prroblems.Its a great movie I loved every moment of Barbara shed is great

B0088W6IMQ|3.0|It's okay - haven't had a chance to really get into the program or characters.  Was a huge fan of the movie and original series so we'll see if this one matches up.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|You grow with each character.  I fell completely in love with Lord Conall Maccon.  Each story in the series draws you more and more into the adventure & you feel invested in the outcome,  LOVED IT!!!  My favorite story was 'Timeless'.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is the ultimate tower defence game,If not one of the best games I've ever played!It has tons of upgrades a 2 hands full of towers,tons of beginner maps intermediate maps hard maps,and if you even dare,extreme maps.so what can I say,the ultimate tower defence games.....Although....I can't help but to feel sorry for the people who were suckerd into the free, down graded  version,bloons td battles because I feel they are missing the true quality gameplay of the actuall game.So what can I say,buy this one!!!
B004EPZ06G|5.0|i saw the first hangover and i loved it so i had to have the 2nd part...the dvd was in great condition.. no scratches,,and it was delivered really fast!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for the new season! Wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is. Easy to follow and great story line.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My son recommended Ender's Game, and I loved it. It's always good to keep in touch with the books that your children like, and I found out we both liked the idea of the future. He liked the action, and we both liked the characters.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|One seems to get the idea that Hollywood has run out of ideas. Actually I think they probably did a while back, they really should think about shutting down for a while or reducing the movies released. There was nothing in the movie that somehow you don't get the feeling you have seen before. There was no story depth, no character build up. The reason I give it 3 star is that it is relatively mild compared to the dark vulgar drabble that Hollywood produces these days.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series....it is funny, witty and sooo British.  I can hardly wait for the next season to begin...I have watched this several times and never feel bored
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Really intense and moving story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and hope others enjoy the true meaning behind it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My nine-year old says simply it was a good book. Just as good as The Lost Hero. Can't wait to read the next one Mark of Athena.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|Yes, the quip above is Dean at his best in a series filled with clever quips and performances.<br /><br />I was afraid that \\"Supernatural\\" might be exorcised after the rather anemic showing of season six (and it didn't help that it was facing other genre shows at the same time on other networks)but the series continues to be the \\"little engine that could\\".<br /><br />Season seven took a strong step in the right direction with a change in leadership, some new and interesting characters.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Season seven ended with Dean being sent to Purgatory along with the leader of the Leviathans. The loss of Bobby during season seven, the introduction of the tablet with the word of God that could permanently close the gates to Hell. In the eighth season opener Dean returns from Purgatory with the help of a vampire named Benny who has changed his ways. Unfortunately Cass ended up in Purgatory as well and doesn't return with Dean.<br /><br />Dean returns and finds that Sam has moved on with his life abandoning hunting. Dean convinces Sam to help him find a way to obtain the word of God, Kevin and close the gates to Hell forever. There is a price for everything in \\"Supernatural\\" and its quite steep for everyone involved including Cass who returns whole on the surface but is clearly very damaged beneath the surface.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />As with the previous seasons Warner gives us a top notch transfer with lossless audio. The exception is, of course, \\"Bitten\\" the found footage episode that received a mixed reaction from fans (I kind of like it for a change of pace)as it was shot on consumer grade digital video cameras but, hey, it's supposed to look that way).<br /><br />We get sound tracks in Portuguese and subtitles in English, Spanish and French.<br /><br />What's missing? Prior seasons included a booklet that gave you the title of each episode and credits. The booklet has been discontinued. I kind of miss that.<br /><br />The special features are quite nice for this season. We get three audio commentaries on key episodes \\"Hunteri Heroici\\", \\"As Time Goes By\\" and \\"Everybody Hates Hitler\\".<br /><br />We get a featurette on the creation of the \\"found footage\\" episode. \\"For the Defense of Mankind\\" focuses on the tablet. \\"Angel Warrior: The Story of Castiel\\" is a terrific featurette focusing on the character and actor Misha Collins who defined the role and made it difficult for everyone else to play an angel because, well, they pale in comparison.<br /><br />We get fourteen deleted scenes from the season. We also get the usual (and fun)gag reel.<br /><br />Ultraviolet access is provided to watch these episodes on your PC.<br /><br />Season eight of \\"Supernatural\\" demonstrated that a change in producers helped revitalized the series. While there were a couple of minor stumbles along the way, season eight is very entertaining and largely consistent.<br /><br />Highly recommended.eatures are quite nice for this season.

1451695195|4.0|Love the book and wish it was longer since the experience was phenomenal and gives everyone hope and vision for the spiritual life we can look forward to...
0374214913|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />It starts with a mysterious bookstore and leads into a pen-and-paper game type adventure.<br /><br />If you like bookstores, puzzles, D&D, or fantasy, you should enjoy this story. It is set in current day, and the insertion of modern technology into a centuries old mystery was a lot of fun.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|The book was very long.  This book is for readers who like to read with not that much action within its pages as reward. This classic tale kept my attention for most of it.  Some sections were a bit long but in the  end, I enjoyed it.  I am glad I was able to finish a story which has influenced so much of the vampire genre .
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|so not only does the audio release sound bad now the 5.1 soundtrack is defective. i got my blu-ray from Best buy... same problem. center channel with mostly vocals over powers everything which NOW makes sense after reading all these reviews. i knew it sounded \\"off\\" but i couldn't figure out why... never dawned on me to check all the speakers to hear whats coming out... or not coming out in this case.<br />the right front speaker has a very low volume muffled version of whats coming out of the front left. the back right speaker... totally silent. and the lack of bass from the subwoofer... i am SO disappointed. i REALLY hope the label or even SHE does something about this... there's a lot of pissed off fans here!<br />Oh, btw, this also applies to the DVD edition my friend bought from best buy, same defective 5.1 track.<br />I see Amazon recently pulled the Blu-ray, what about the DVDs?
B008K8VDPU|4.0|i like it b/c it sounds like a real piano, kind of. what i don't like about it is the instructions for some songs are lame.;[
B009XTF8KQ|2.0|This stinker of a movie is uninspired, forgettable and a blatant rip off of all the other possession movies being mass produced by Hollywood. The slight difference being a Jewish twist. Blah blah blah. Wasted performances across the board.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|From the villains to the heroes, this one sucked.<br />The special effects were a waste of time. Go read a book.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Movie will not play.  Sony is updated to latest firmware, Opening Logo screen and trailers of upcoming releases play fine.  Freezes when movie menu should appear.  Waited close to 10min, on a blank screen.<br /><br />Update 12 hours later:  Ok, I needed to reset the S570 to factory defaults for video playback and system settings.  I also unplugged USB memory stick then re-inserted to reset it as well.<br /><br />I then loaded the movie and it played great!!  Im a happy camper now.
0525953728|5.0|Terrific reading and account of the mission......  My son recommended the book to me who is part of that unit in the Navy.
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|This movie was on a roll until about the 50 minute mark or so. At that point it turned from something fresh into a typical Hollywood horror movie. It become predictable and quite honestly lame. On the whole it was enjoyable because the first half was some really good stuff.
0553382179|5.0|Maria Cilley is one of my favorite people in the world!  Although we have never met, she has changed my life and my home.  I cannot say enough good things about using her system of making your home into the clean and inviting place that you want to be without killing yourself.  Her system is oddly difficult to catch on to. It took me several attempts and more than one reading to grasp it.  The best approach is to simply do what she says and don't over think it. I recommend this book to absolutely everyone!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Many folks claim that season 4 was Dexter's best season ever. I tend to disagree. Season 7 started so slow, I stopped watching it after 4 episodes... then I started seeing it some months later off season and did I regret ever doing that! I can honestly say, season 7 might come to you as a slow start but it is THE BEST season Dexter has had EVER.<br /><br />Get it, watch it. You won't regret it!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen three different versions of this story.  Without question, this is absolutely the best.  The chemistry between the main characters is palpable.  They develop their relationship in such a compelling way that I found myself feeling as though I was watching a true story.  If you enjoy this genre of movie, I have to believe you will love watching......over and over.....this remarkably well produced film.
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|This film came highly recommended and I can now take opposition to that notion. Acting was better than average but the story felt stale and there were no redeeming qualities I could find from it. Just because Del Toro inks his name on a project doesn't make it a winner.
B00DQVST76|1.0|The show itself is amazing and I love the editing and techniques used. Madonna did an amazing job.<br />Interscope/Universal did a disgusting job making this disk. Without pointing out the lazy and superficial effort put into making the artwork,<br /><br />1- Menu is amateurish, poorly designed and you can’t really distinguish the selection options because the text is white and the highlight selection is a light gray.<br /><br />2- Video quality of the DVD is blurred and poor, you feel like you are whatching an 80’s VHS tape and you can’t barely see Madonna’s facial expressions or details (and this has nothing to do with the filters) the complexity of the visuals are lost in the DVD.  Blu-ray video quality is painfully grainy (again, nothing to do with the technique or efects) but this can be smoothen by changing the display options on your TV from auto to cinema.<br /><br />3- Audio quality of DVD is very good. On the Blu-ray audio is terrible. Dolby 5.1 dosen’t work on one side of the speakers  and you miss some sounds and bass is almost nonexistent up to the point that you don’t want to watch it at all.<br />I was able to compare these two against the Digital Download version of the video and the previous EPIX broadcast. It’s so sad and depressing to have such an amazing tour ruined by this horrible oversight. I am returning 2 Blu-Ray discs and 1 DVD and just watch my digital download until this issue is corrected.
1401937519|5.0|Great writing!! Easy to read. Love the book. It is filled with many great thoughts and a very poignant story. Definitely worth the read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I downloaded the new update and I have yet to get to play it. I open the app click on the new levels click level one and the app closes and takes me back to the home page. I have been very happy with all the AngryBirds games but I am disappointed that you offered a update and it doesn't work. Please fix this.
B005LAIHCM|1.0|More unoriginal garbage failing to deliver an enjoyable experience. This gets filed next to all the other over produced predictable crap.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I liked this film, I thought it was creative . Different than the usual depiction of extraterrestrial type stories. .
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One of the best Jack Ryan stories I have read. The book deals with many of the scary things that could actually be happening all over the world.  A lot to think about really.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series provides a  look into the life long past. A must see if you are interested in history. Highly recommend
B003D5FFY0|5.0|Enjoyed the variety of music on this cd.  A great collection of his greatest hits and very enjoyable to listen to!
B003UYV08E|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the implacable Mickey Rourke and the gifted Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />I was really impressed and surprised with their (Mickey Rourke and Robert Downey Jr.) minimal facial makeup, proudly displaying their handsome &#34;advanced, seasoned&#34; age. I was captivated and knocked-off-my-feet. Their &#34;natural&#34; appearance was very realistic and I really liked it! -- (Aging males do not need or require the pounds of make-up females plaster on their face.)<br /><br />Although the plot was albeit shallow, that's ok with me, for as a (male) Science Fiction based Action Film I do not expect much of an &#34;in depth&#34; bewildering plot. The graphics were VERY good AND the acting was VERY good.<br /><br />And again ,,, Mickey Rourke was FANTASTIC!!! ,,, Robert Downey Jr. is a gifted actor.<br /><br />The only part of this movie that I DID NOT ENJOY was the PATHETIC and obligatory token (female) exposing her udders, something ALL Amerikan (sic) movies MUST HAVE by decree of the Amerikan bovine which was accompanied by the bogus and also obligatory token (female) trashing numerous GROWN MEN ,,, ho-hum ,,, WHY the Amerikan (sic) Movie Industry feels the necessity to include these two bovine scenarios ,,, in EVERY Amerikan film ,,, can only be answered as such:: To keep the Amerikan bovine (from birth) a liar, whore, prostitute, gold-digger ,,, and bigot. Pitiful.
B00AG51V8E|4.0|Bruce Willis being himself and now he has his son who is a mirror image of him while repeating his extreme dislike that his sister had for their father. Like her, he too learns the error of his thinking but not before they blow up a lot of things, run, jump, hide, shoot...ect. Great escapism movie which is what they all are.

B00005R5G9|4.0|This is one funny adventure filled movie.Keeps you laughing all the way through. Enjoy watching it over and over.<br />  Just love the scenes in the store. Awesome!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's smart, sassy, and holds your interest thru the whole show.  Would recommend highly.  Good contrast of characters and how they interact.
031603438X|5.0|The undisputed legend of R&R, Keith Richards tells it all in grandiose fashion.  Such an entertaining read that surpasses some the crap they have on late-night television.  If you're into music and love a good autobiographical work, LIFE is well worth the purchase and read.  Others I highly recommend are: KIDS (by Patti Smith), Miles (by Miles David and Quincy Troupe) and WAGING HEAVY PEACE (by Neil Young).
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use it as white noise for baby and it works great. lots of other sound options too. cool idea.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was pretty good. It has all the features you could want from a YA Fantasy. The movie however is another story. If you insist on seeing the movie, then I would watch it first before you read the book.
B00498YXG6|5.0|It's a good movie - not as great as Sex and the City 1 but worth the watch.  Funny at times
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Great movie and my favorite of the series. Story line was good along with the cgi. The action scenes were incredible.
B0040QYROA|4.0|First of all, it would be truly eye opening experience during the 1920s when the film was first shown. I would say some of its technique in filming is still quite useful these days, and exceeding many B movies.<br /><br />However, as people evolves, the plot and its story is too simple. Maybe the way of story telling get advanced quite a lot for the past century.
0470477237|5.0|In the increasingly complex world of social media, how do you begin to successfully engage in social media marketing for your business? Dan Zarrella has responded to that question with \\"The Social Media Marketing Book.\\" It's a quick read. But the small book is packed with useful information for those itching to jump into the social media marketing fray.
B003U657OA|5.0|Great Movie, its funny, sad and happy all wrapped up in one.  It kept the same quality as the show.  Very good
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Excellent series - all 8 years! You actually start to care about the characters! I am anxious for season 9 to start!
B004DNWPY4|5.0|Book gets a little wordy, and lots of statistics that don't matter to me - but it has tons of good information and is totally worth the read.  Author drives home his key points - and I found this book to be a great resource and eye opener.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I recommend this book to people who are interested in the paranormal and the mythical creatures and stuff and I say from experience that this is a very good book-!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Loved this work by David Baldacci .. in fact I got hold of book #2 &#34;The Forgotten&#34; and couldn't give it high enough praise. John Puller is one heck of a character to reckon with without sounding like a superhero.  Im only regret is that there's only 2 books by Mr. Baldacci on John Puller.  David, please find some other worth cause for Mr. Puller :-)
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Quick read and very entertaining.  Overall a great book if you have limited time.  Kept me wanting more.  You will not be disappointed.
B001NLL93W|4.0|The story was a little slow to start, but it got definitively better. The last few chapters were action packed and so emotional. I actually thought this was the last book, until I saw the next book available.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I finally received my Google Chromecast from Amazon yesterday.<br /><br />My verdict?  Mixed...<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The device hooks up easily.  All you need is a free HDMI and USB port on the back of your TV.  The USB is needed to provide the power to run the device.  You do get a AC to USB adapter in the box if your TV doesn't have any USB ports.<br /><br />You are directed to a Google site to setup the device.  You have to setup from a computer/tablet/phone that is currently on the same WiFi network as the one you wish to setup the Chromecast.  I mistakenly tried to setup the Chromecast from my ethernet-connected desktop PC and it failed to run the setup.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The Google Chromecast is a device that really should be considered a 'beta' version.  So far, the device only supports Netflix and Youtube, and will only 'broadcast' web pages in Google Chrome (no surprise there).  The big deficiency is that it does not support Silverlight which for me meant I could not broadcast my Amazon Prime videos over the Chromecast.<br /><br />Granted the Chromecast only costs $35, however don't throw out your Roku if you have one.  It is a superior product.  I'm hoping that Google is not done with development and has further enhancements coming soon.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Just saw Paul recently in Tulsa, OK, and this show is very similar to what he is doing now.  Quality is fantastic!  You get the video, and the CD's.  Worth twice the asking price.
B000FBFML6|5.0|I do enjoy losing myself in Robin Hobb's world.  I read the Assassin's Apprentice series first and found this series to be a great follow up read.
0802473156|5.0|This book provides great insight and keys to understanding relationship difficulties. For those still early in a relationship, it is essential reading to maintain the love.
B00DNDR29I|2.0|I love Janelle Monae and have purchased all of her albums but this album is ummm average at best. Her last album Arch Android was fire!!!! This one is all over the place and average at best. The songs chosen seem like they should have been left on the cutting room floor. Now the Prince and Miguel Joints are great but theres maybe 5 good songs out of 19 (the Overtures rock!!!). The interludes with the androids are less to be desired. On her previous albums the androids were on a chase and painted a musical storyline but on this one they seem like ghetto, hoodrat droids twerking -- what part of the game is this???? I still love Janelle Monae and support her but if your looking for the futuristic, ground breaking songs like her past albums, you may be disappointed.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|\\"Dexter: The Seventh Season\\"<br />(HBO, 2013)<br />NOTE: There might be small spoilers below. don't kill me.<br /><br />. . .<br /><br />Sigh. My wife and I have been big \\"Dexter\\" fans for several years, but Season Seven was really a chore to get through. The stories and character motivations seem strained, the plot devices spawned many unlikely, impractical scenarios, and numerous characters (not just Dexter) pursued courses of action that seemed improbable and ill-advised. Deb, in particular. The emergence of yet another love interest for Dexter held its share of tedium, as well as potential psychological angles that could have been better explored... Numerous supporting characters were thrust into situations that weren't that involving and in general the show seems to be going through the motions, occasionally peppering the landscape with HBO-style sex and gore to keep viewers titillated. Or so they think: it's starting to get old.<br /><br />One bright spot, and I mean a HUGE positive for this season was Irish actor Ray Stevenson who was AMAZING as the bad guy Isaak Sirko.  Stevenson, who previously played the soldier Titus Pullo in HBO's \\"Rome,\\" is intensely magnetic and subtle, and steals every scene he's in. Our recommendation: cast this guy as James Bond. Immediately. In the meantime, this was a great performance, and one of the only real highlights to what was otherwise a rather sluggish, repetitive season of \\"Dexter.\\" I guess Season Eight is the series finale... hopefully they are renewing their creative juices to make that final season a real winner. (Axton)
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Quick, witty and full of action, Star Trek doesn't disappoint. This is also one of those movies I could watch three times in a row and not get bored. Everyone has a movie they like that much, for whatever reason. This is mine.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|To funny! Love this movie!!! &#34;What is this? A center for ants&#34;!!!! &#34;Orange Moca Frappuccino&#34;! &#34;Zip it Zane&#34;! &#34;Relax don't do it&#34;
B008469DGY|5.0|Do not download if you plan to do anything productive, this game sucks you in. This game is fun for all ages. I highly recommend.
B005WTR4ZI|2.0|I watched an interview of the author on the youtube, and I was really amazed by some of his ideas. I thought if he is able to communicate so many interesting ideas in a 10 page interview, he probably has great things to say in a +150 pages book, but this is really not a book, a 20 - 25 pages article on (a very interesting idea) which was structured in the form of longer book for commercial purposes.<br /><br />So I would not really recommend buying the book, just watch his online interviews.
B001RU2YUQ|5.0|When reading about the film, Australia, one often sees the film referred to as &#34;The Australian Gone with the Wind.&#34; I agree fully as it has a long runtime and it is an epic love story.<br /><br />Also, it has Hugh Jackman. That alone gives this movie an automatic 5 stars.
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than this! This is a true CLASSIC.  It is indeed timeless!!  This is MY music.  I listened to them 50 years ago and I still listen to them now!!!  Try it and you will enjoy it too!!!!

0316286850|5.0|The author: was one of the greatest makeup artists of all time who passed in 2002. He has worked with many celebrities and the books he wrote are the gifts of his extensive experience. They are invaluable to those who love experimenting with make-up or photographers who are looking to understand how looks read.<br /><br />What this book is: a collection of looks for various ages and skin types. It has step by step instructions from start to finish with each look. The end of the book is more creative--celebrities pose as different types with the same instructions on how to get the look. Amazing advice scattered throughout.<br /><br />What this book is not: a how to guide for the absolute beginner or the beginner who wants more extensive handholding (there is nothing wrong with that!). However, if you are willing to spend some time and effort working with this book and trying to recreate his looks then you will learn a ton! Remember, not all looks are for everyone--so learning what works for what face type is something you will need to discover on your own from practice and his photos. A good book for the absolute beginner would be Jemma Kid's guide!<br /><br />For those worried that the publication will be dated: I think this book is timeless. He presents so many different looks with so many different references and uses both neutrals and color that you are bound to find something that works for you. Plus he presents many looks that are classic--one is even called \\"classical\\" if I remember correctly. And if you do not care for the neutral colors, pick different ones! It's the techniques that are important to learn anyway.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I have been meaning to read this book all year and finally did.  I couldn't put it down. The ending made me want to know what happened in the future!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|You can really kick back and enjoy the &#34;team&#34; their antics and action.<br /><br />Nice arament lots oexposions and love that sea plane.
0380713802|4.0|I have now read two of Bryson's books. Both are not whole, but that is not what I was looking for. As a matter of fact I didn't know what I was looking for. That is why I really enjoyed this book. After a summer of traveling, in some cases to places in the book, I not only needed to get a good laugh, but read someone I could identify with. Wow. There is not a story exactly, but an attempt at a traveling stand up act where the comic is continually the butt of the joke. There are  some pretty smart insights but also some rather petulant whining. I sympathized with too much of this! No, this will not be sold at gift shops in Bulgaria, or the Vatican but it is worth the escape.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I don't have much to say other than this is not the same as Swype or even the Google keyboard that is built in to Android. The layout, although I only tried it on my tablet it is not good. I think there is a tablet version, but I can't imagine it being as good as the others as this one as not either.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like the display and the volume of the alarm. I had a different alarm application and you could'nt hear the alarm with the volume cranked all the way up.
B008602KQI|5.0|Just a well directed film with great acting telling an interesting tale.<br />Great footage and both memorable and audacious characters
B004P4O87I|5.0|As advertised, shipped quickly. Kits are quality as most Lego kits are. Way over my head, but the grand kids went wild.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This app adds a nice little cartoon look to to your photos as well as other filters for different effects. It is a fast little app that does what it says. There are a lot of different effects and filters to choose from. My favorite has to be the Neon effect. It is pretty cool to make your own neon photos.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I am a little concerned that pikmin made it on the board lol. Other than that its pretty awesome to play if you are a Nintendo fan
B008YRVW0I|4.0|A fun matching game with benefits. Building the aquarium is fulfilling and rather relaxing, as well.  Pretty good game for the price.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Bought this for a Christmas gift last year and kids still watch it every now and then. The special features are good on this set.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Plot events are not drawn out but are constantly evolving.  Great character development and definitely worth following the show through the second season.
1623360277|5.0|This is a great antidote to the sickness and obesity so many people live with due to consuming the Standard American diet.  It explains how starches, vegetables, fruits -- whole foods -- are what we are designed to eat and how all animal products -- including fish -- are disastrous to our health.  It doesn't leave you hanging, but presents many great recipes so you know you're not faced with a lifetime of eating steamed plain veggies, and gives you plenty of tips on how to live with and eat with the many other people who continue to consume unhealthy foods.  A fast, easy read.
B00821OX98|5.0|I stumbled across this series while searching for something to watch - didn't know it was on TV. All I can say is WOW. I spent days watching the episodes one after the other and then watched season two - and then ordered season three.  Now I can't wait for season four to start.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|I thought this movie was well made, but the kids have not watched it much. It might be lacking a little something that peeks kids' interests.
B00BXLU1EU|2.0|This app me the wrong passcode to my house. Connected me to another random network though....<br />I am so confused.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I initially bought this with the intention to expand upon my hobby of rapid-learning applied to various skills. Eventually I plan to tackle cooking, so that part was more of a bonus that'll come in handy later. Strange, I know. However this book is amazing, even when used slightly out of context, like I did.<br /><br />I especially liked the sections on picking up foreign languages and memory techniques for remembering complex strings of numbers. The first applies to my life immediately (I'm aiming to learn conversational Japanese & kanji within 2 months), and the other is a practical godsend, since I've always been rather forgetful with numbers.<br /><br />In regards to the main reasons why I bought it (i.e. not for cooking), a lot of the content can be found on the 4-hour workweek blog. However, Tim does add more detail to most of these shared topics, as well as adding some new misc info. (Not to mention how it's supposed to be a book on cooking first, with universal principles to learning new skills added as a secondary perk. :p)<br /><br />All in all, I heartily recommend it. After all: if you hate the eBook, returns are ridiculously easy, so you really have nothing to lose.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I was skeptical when I went to the first movie in this series, but came away well entertained by this new mix in the Star Trek genre.  This second film solidifies a great cast while giving the viewer a new twist on a twice told tale.  The action never stops, the dialogue is sharp without being trite, and the interaction of the characters is familiar.  The special effects, the hallmark of any good sci-fi film, are well done.  So, get some popcorn, put your feet up,] enjoy.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|The movie is great. My kids have watched this over and over. I think this is one of the better movies Disney has produced.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I love this game.  I was looking for a great turn based game and this one has proven addictive.  I have not spent any money on it yet.  Give it a try.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|This cable was sent to charge my kindle fire.  However I do not believe the charging problem was with my old cable.  The kindle charges completely sometimes but not others times, the cable does not seem to matter.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|To say I loved this book would be an understatement.  From the minute I started reading, I didn't want to stop. Such a thought provoking love story between Will, a man who had lived a &#34;big life&#34; prior to his tragic accident, and Lou, a somewhat eccentric young woman, who kept herself enclosed in a small world. The author does a wonderful job in bringing the characters and their story to life.  When asked by friends for book recommendations, &#34;Me Before You&#34; will be at the top of my list.
B00BBQXQFI|2.0|My kids have only watched this a few times. They have never asked to rewatch this. It seemed okay to me, but I am an adult. It obviously lacks some interest for its intended age group.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Well balanced price/quality.<br />You can save some money against other bag brands.<br />Last long, and protect equipment.<br />A good choice.
B009NH6AOQ|3.0|I'm a fan Of the comic and the first 2 seasons. My intelligence felt insulted. You have ppl wasting bullets firing guns in the air. Naive followers of a mad man. Half of the episodes were basically pointless filler. And why is it they can shoot every zombie between the eyes but everyone firing can't hit the guy standing in the open drawing attention to himself? Don't insult me. That's when I turned the channel for good...
B007HACDLK|5.0|He had a gritty writing style , but his Mitch Rapp series all center around a gritty character. They just work!
B009RH9FR6|1.0|I would not recommend this case to anyone it is bulk. But most of all it flips out of your hand real easy. Mine flipped out of my hand and dropped a foot of the ground and cracked my screen now I have to buy a new Kindle.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|love this game but very disappointing that the in app ordering does not work. even after uninstalling and reinstalling it still will not let me order more levels. this will keep me from playing any other games by noodlecake. too bad fun games
B0013FXWU6|5.0|If driven, complex and disturbed human beings intrigue you, then delve into this character.  Daniel Plainview should go down as a great study of goals, greed, principles, distress, misanthropy and longing, just to get a start.  The music is superb and is as unique as the character.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I really like King and Maxwell in David Baldacci's new series.  The background stories are as interesting as the main plot.  Frankly however, the TV shows didn't do it justice.  The stars are very good (Jon Tenney is a hunk), but the script was herky jerky.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I completely enjoyed playing this! I needed help from the walkthrough guide a few times. But I was quite sad when I finished it. Had such lovely relaxing music and beautiful scenes. Was a pleasure to play.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved this game. not so hard you can't figure it out. but not so easy that you just run right through it.
1401207529|5.0|Batman: Year One is well written and illustrated.  It maintains the essential darkness of Batman and is exactly what I wanted out of a modern Batman comic.  I will definitely purchase the remaining Batman volumes by Frank Miller.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Great story, great series.  Kudos to Michael Connelly on this one.  It keeps you interested throughout, and gives unexpected twists at the end.  A must read.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Man this game was fun to play. I got stuck once and had to look up what to do. But I finished it in one day! And I never finish anything in one day. Lol<br />Proof that its way too short. And it ended oddly. Like there should be more? He says he has so much to show you.....but then it's over. Well? Do I get to see it? Lol. Guessssss not. :/<br />So it loses a star for that I suppose.
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|This is a great figure. If you are thinking about getting this figure dont hesitate. This figure of Luffy is well worth you're money especially if you are big one piece fan. I am overall satisfied with amazon and my purchase.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I love the rebuilt franchise! Great film, with some serious action scenes & a tad special effects.? lol I like the rebuilt or retooled characters, great chemistry between the cast. Plus they drop in a few moments from the original 60s TV show, you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy this film! (it just helps lol) I like the story line that they are developing along with this franchise, ads to it! I'm a science fiction nerd, so I love that that they are bringing back to of the greatest scify franchises, Star Trek & soon Star Wars!!
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|I have seen the movie before so I knew what I was getting into. Now having seen the new Riddick, this is by far the best one of all 3!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Excellent show! I could not stop watching and can't wait till season 4! It is an extremely well written show
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It took a while for the story to develop, but when it did, it was gripping.  The domino effect of one tragic event resulted in a  far reaching complex ending.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I wanted an alarm on my tablet and this one was free.<br />I haven't had any poblems with it, yet.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|I like Matt Damon in thriller action movies. It was a little like his Bourne movies but a bit more of a futuristic vibe to it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very sad and moving book. The characters are sympathetic and heartbreaking.  Anything that reveals the horrors of slavery is a necessary read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy configuration, nice quality, good app.  It streams You Tube very well.  I wish that it supported Gallery images and videos.  I bought it expecting that it would.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I love google search engine so it was another essential addition to the tablet.<br />I haven't used it yet though.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|when ever I try to play it says error sega sonic CD plz try again why? just dose it say that???
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is awesome. My entire family loves it.  We love the time limit which allows every to play.  It is a great addictive game.
0385366752|2.0|My husband and I listen to this audio on a trip we made and we both thought that it was way to long and repeated itself many times.  We know it was on the best seller list, but we thought differently.  The author could have cut out about 3 of those disc's.
0143122916|5.0|This is well written, with a great preface and interspersed historical detail and reference.  I'm so glad that someone helped Shin put his story in the spotlight.  It is so hard to believe this really is happening in this day and age.  I was moved as well as educated.  I really wish that world leaders would get together and try to effectively do something... really makes you think of Adolf Hitler.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|This is a great movie, one of my favorites in the Star Trek franchise. Lots of action, adventure, and excitement.
B005F265CA|5.0|Love the movie!  Blu-ray was very nice in screen. Would recommend it to others to buy. Was worth my money and the price was great!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is the first time I have got a app of sounds. Love the layers and all the choices. Timer is great extra.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Although I'm by no means a hardcore Star Trek fan, I've watch Star Trek from day one and this movie makes me cringe. The action sequences and special effects are excellent, but everything else about the movie can be summed up in one word: HORRIBLE! The way the actors try to imitate the original cast is very annoying. The humor falls flat, because there's nothing original about it. Bottom line, the cast is a very, very cheap imitation of the original cast. What little plot there is to tie the action sequences together is very predictable and paper thin. Oh, need I even go into casting Cumberbatch as Khan! Well, I will. Simply, put horrible choice, but the casting for this movie and the first Abrams Star Trek is horrible. So why should things get any better?<br /><br />How JJ Abrams keeps getting work is beyond me. All of his recent TV shows have flopped and he's never really made a decent movie. I don't know how many times I've heard the media refer to him as the \\"master of science fiction\\". Well, Abrams is a hack. I blame this movie's failings squarely on him.
B00BL5YQKS|2.0|I watched a few episodes but couldn't get into this. Vic Mackey is unlikeable and the dialogue left much to be desired.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|It's an ebook, does what an ebook should and is a wonderful series. I read it from my iPad4 using the Kindle app.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It was a  Very Good book to read! It was easy and quick to read. There was good info in the book!
B00CZF8B68|5.0|We heard this song for the first time on SiriusXM's Kids Place Live...my kids love it, and I love it too. Since we went to see Despicable Me 2 they just call it &#34;The Minion Song that the Minions Don't Sing.&#34;
B0019IB0II|5.0|Fascinating journey into the workings of the brain - from a neuroscientist's perspective.  She does make it very understandable to the layman and an enjoyable read.  I have ordered it in audiobook form as well as several more copies of the book to give as gifts.  Most especially I would like my daughter, who is in nursing school and stresses out very easily, to read it and realize that she is not at the mercy of her emotions but that she can train and control her thought patterns to a more productive and enjoyable end.  I have made a concerted effort to do so myself, and have been reaping the benefits in the form of experiencing more joy, peace, and gratitude in my life.  I appreciated how Dr. Taylor explained exactly how she does this to give the reader some guidance, but urges that you find what works for you.  All in all a great read and an incredible story - even if you have no desire to alter or improve your own brain function, however, once you've read it you will be inspired to improve your life.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|I saw Mumford and Son live a few months ago (best show I've ever seen . . .and I've seen a ton) but was going through withdrawal afterwards so I bought this for the live cd. It's been in my cd play ever since. It might be my best cd purchase ever too!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Love this app I make it my screen saver,because its always show that .right time and the weather also love the live weather
0062235893|1.0|This is NOT the full version of the story! If you want the whole story you have to get the hard cover.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is fun and super addicting. They update it quite often and it's so much fun to play. Super cute graphics and games.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Although I don't regularly read science fiction, I found the themes in this book thought-provoking and intriguing, and can engage a much wider audience than just sci-fi fans. The language is lucid and at times sensual, an interesting blend of the futuristic world of technology and the organic world of love and lust, and the stories surprise you with unexpected twists. My favorites in the book are \\"Maciste,\\" \\"Life in Prison,\\" \\"A Perfect family,\\" and \\"Forms of Love.\\"
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I enjoy my old Bruce songs, but I really liked this CD with his new songs; slower, soulful, ballads that expressed much feeling. I love his voice no matter what he sings.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Update:<br />Using the Chromecast for however long it has been out now, I like it. However, I kind of wish I invested in a good HDMI for my laptop instead.  I never cast YouTube or Netflix from my iPad or my phone, which leaves using it exclusively for my laptop.  I hear the tab-casting is still in beta mode, but I wish it was better. Netflix and YouTube are not the movie/film-viewing sites that I often use, and any other sites would experience delay/lagging/disconnection with the tab casting via the Chrome browser.  I've seen my sister use her phone to cast Netflix onto your family TV and it works superbly (you can even leave the house or your phone can die and it will still play).  The tab casting, I feel, relies on good reliable internet.  If you don't have a good connection, don't have any hopes of watching anything on the TV.  However, even with the best connection (which I have), you WILL experience technical difficulties.  It's still a good product, but there are still major improvements that need to be made.  Not worth the price for where it is, developmentally speaking.<br /><br />//<br />I initially ordered a Chromecast from the Google website and it just came in last night. Although I haven't had it for too long, I'm sure I know of how well or poorly it works.<br /><br />The dongle itself is great, it saves the hassle of having to connect a Thunderbolt to HDMI cable to watch something on the big screen. My TV actually has a USB port, so an external source of power was not necessary. The dongle powers up by itself after the TV is turned on, and the input is selected (depending on where you inserted the Chromecast). I initially had trouble, I couldn't get the set up screen to come up. I only had a black screen with a few white dots at 480p. After going online to learn how to trouble shoot it, it turns out all I needed to do was unplug it, click the reset button a couple of times (to make sure it wasn't jammed), and then plug it back in. The set up was easy.Downloaded and installed Chromecast on all of my devices (both Android and IOS) in no time.<br />For the longest time, I've been using my TV as an external monitor, more for movies than anything. The fact that I am unable to see documents on the big screen (like I ever did that anyways) is tad disheartening, but I got over it. It takes a little while for something to be cast on to the TV, and at times, the connection can fail (I had it happen once so far).  The Youtube app had to be cast and then loaded before what I was watching was on the screen. Having something casted isn't as instantaneous as I had hoped, but I'm willing to work with it.<br />I don't often use Netflix or Amazon for movies. I'm more preferential toward third-party sites for my movies. I was worried that the movies wouldn't cast on my Macbook, but it did. But when it did, I was worried I'd have to watch it small-screen with the Google Chrome browser clearly evident. However, I noticed that after I clicked the full-screen button, the movie expanded on both my Macbook and the TV, but, you can still multi-task due to the multiple desktop function of the Macbook (which is a lifesaver)! Simply swipe to another desktop to start/continue working on something else.<br />I'm still in the process of looking for an extension or app of Google Chrome that would allow me to play music from my Itunes, which would make the Chromecast amazing in all aspects. But so far, my searches have come up empty-handed.<br /><br />For a small, convenient dongle that allows you to cast and watch movies from electronic devices to the big screen, the price is great. A decent Thunderbolt to HDMI cable would cost as much, and wouldn't allow you to connect your devices to the TV. For $35, it's a good buy. I'm hoping that there will be more updates to improve the 'syncing' and smooth playing of the movies and media. Other than that, I see no problem with it. I'm actually ordering another one from Amazon for my parents (it costs less than Google because of the shipping).<br /><br />Easy to use.<br />Convenient.<br /><br />Try it!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Spoiler ahead.....<br /><br />This film was either given praise or hate, I personally enjoyed it. My favorite Star Trek film is not action oriented (The Undiscovered Country) but that isn't to say this film isn't one of my favorite Trek films as now I believe it to be. Many criticize the film for not staying true to its mirror image \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\". I personally believe they are each great in their own special way. In this version he is more physical in the original he was more mentally controlling. Both are fine ingredients in a villain and I could elaborate more on the differences between the two Khan performances but I feel watching the performances does them more justice and both films are indeed worthy of a watch, or two, or three! At the end of the day this was a easy buy and I do not regret seeing this in theaters or buying the BD and it will be watched I'm sure many, many times.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age, yet again, has failed to disappoint. This album seems a little darker and full of personal storytelling on Homme's part, offering an insight deep into the artist's mind. As a fan of Queens, you can't ask for much more. His lyricism is on point as usual, the songs swing through a variety of styles while still staying true to the Queens sound, and the &#34;guest&#34; musicians really add to their respective tracks. From beginning to end, even through the &#34;slow&#34; songs, this album will keep you rocking.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I knew how the book ended before I started, but still enjoyable. Ignoring the fantasy side, I am not sure how accurately it depicts society at the time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love it!! Kicked my butt the first week but got used to it. :) i really like that there are three different levels and u can choose to stick to one level until YOU feel you're ready for the next. Im happy with my purchasee.
B00A2H9OZS|3.0|Diesel's passion project for the last half decade finally comes to the big screen and fans like myself were very excited. Little did I know this movie would be so thin in script and short in scope. The big seller for this film was \\"It is like Pitch Black\\". That sounds good and while it tries, it does not succeed. Frankly the movie is watchable and I am looking forward to seeing a directors cut in hopes like with \\"Chronicles\\" that it will help the film's scope and possibly its script (I have my doubts). Having said that I still cannot get over how underwhelmed I was coming out of the theater. Diesel tried it seemed to bring his best to the role (especially in the first 30 minutes of the film) but at the end of the day the script tried to hard to remind the character that he was not expanding like he was in \\"Chronicles\\" and instead going backward to a place we've seen already. Lastly I think this film went in the wrong direction and yes with its budget it couldn't do much of what the franchise did in \\"Chronicles\\" but that isn't an excuse to go backwards with a decade old character that many have grown to love.
B0094MQJXW|5.0|I LOVE IT THIS IS MY FAVORITE  MOVIE OF ALL TIMES. I CAN WATCH IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. Neve does an awesome job!
B0096MM9GG|5.0|This game is very interesting and a great game.  My husband originally got the game on his tablet and when my 5 year old son got his Kindle he got it as well.  Great game!
B000TX7B5U|4.0|System Of A Down, one of the most original, innovative, profound, and talented heavy metal groups of the 1990's, and easily one of the nu-metal genre's best outfits, built a career around simple thrash-influenced riffs, amazing vocals, and interesting, politically-charged lyrics. Unfortunately, they went on indefinite hiatus in 2005. But said band's frontman, Serj Tankian, found a way to keep busy, because just two years after their dissolution, Serj exploded back onto the scene with a solo album. 2007's \\"Elect The Dead\\" mostly, if not completely, gets by on the same foundation building blocks that System did.<br /><br />\\"Elect\\" might not trump any of SOAD's releases, but one thing is for certain: It is a very inspired effort. Indeed, Serj clearly has a lot to talk about over the course of these twelve songs, and if that means stuffing a few too many words into the verse of a song (see: \\"Saving Us\\"), then so be it. American politics is once again the dude's main source of inspiration, with his main target being war, finances (r.e. greed), political hypocrisy, and the apocalypse. But his subject matter, no matter how serious it may be, are, of course, tainted with an undeniably amusing sense of humor much of the time.<br /><br />\\"Empty Walls\\" is a hard and heavy, propulsive and driving, yet simultaneously controlled, opener that is filled with maniacal, borderline rambling vocals (including memorable, shout-worthy choruses), inspiring, thought-provoking lyricism, and a palpable energy. With that said, though, \\"Elect The Dead\\" actually works best when one of its songs starts out melodically and then builds to bracing, commanding heaviness. This is the case with \\"The Unthinking Majority,\\" which has a sluggish, feedback-laden intro, and \\"Money,\\" which opens with a nice, piano-sounding melody. But any notion of restraint is soon smashed to bits in both songs, with heavy, punching, blasting riffs, jarring tempo changes, and (in the case of the latter song: Schizophrenic, screamed vocals) taking charge after a while. The former of these two tunes is noticeably lacking a great chorus, but its sheer sonic energy and momentum more than atone for that fact. (It is a chaotic, all-over-the-place, and completely off-the-wall number, thus evoking vintage System.)<br /><br />\\"Feed Us\\" finds monstrous, reverberating power chords, blast drumming, and ominous bass lines trading off with much quieter and calmer sections, forming an excellent friction between the two styles. \\"Baby\\" is another standout in that it begins sounding like a pretty ballad (and one that is complete with warm and soulful crooning), before escalating to a massive and brutal finale/climax. Others include the lovely piece of power balladry that is \\"Sky Is Over\\"; the intentionally humorous \\"Lie Lie Lie\\"; \\"Praise The Lord And Pass The Ammunition,\\" which is even more of a hilarious self-parody, and one that showcases Serj's amazing vocal range (here he lays down some swift rap/scat-esque vocals and pseudo beat-boxing over a hip-hop-inflected beat and bass line); and the very thrashy and zany \\"Beethoven.\\" And the album closing title song is also worth noting, as it is a peaceful, docile, and gentle ballad centered around a chilling piano line and astonishing clean singing.<br /><br />Again, \\"Elect The Dead\\" does not come anywhere close to being as great as any of the albums that System Of A Down ever released. But it is still a good album all the same. And if nothing else, it at least serves as a nice, and very substantial snack for fans to chew on until the seemingly inevitable System reunion.screamed vocals) taking charge after a while. The former of these two tunes is noticeably lacking a great chorus, but its sheer sonic energy and momentum more than atone for that fact. (It is a chaotic, all-over-the-place, and completely off-the-wall number, thus evoking vintage System.)<br /><br />\\"Feed Us\\" finds monstrous, reverberating power chords, blast drumming, and ominous bass lines trading off with much quieter and calmer sections, forming an excellent friction between the two styles. \\"Baby\\" is another standout in that it begins sounding like a pretty ballad (and one that is complete with warm and soulful crooning), before escalating to a massive and brutal finale/climax. Others include the lovely piece of power balladry that is \\"Sky Is Over\\"; the intentionally humorous \\"Lie Lie Lie\\"; \\"Praise The Lord And Pass The Ammunition,\\" which is even more of a hilarious self-parody, and one that showcases Serj's amazing vocal range (here he lays down some swift rap/scat-esque vocals and pseudo beat-boxing over a hip-hop-inflected beat and bass line); and the very thrashy and zany \\"Beethoven.\\" And the album closing title song is also worth noting, as it is a peaceful, docile, and gentle ballad centered around a chilling piano line and astonishing clean singing.<br /><br />Again, \\"Elect The Dead\\" does not come anywhere close to being as great as any of the albums that System Of A Down ever released. But it is still a good album all the same. And if nothing else, it at least serves as a nice, and very substantial snack for fans to chew on until the seemingly inevitable System reunion.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like at the arcade, I play this game all the time now! love it!!! I wish I didn't lose so many things tothe gutter though. Even the arcade has walls!
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|After buying air hockey pro I can't get it on kindle very frustrating.would love some help<br />I Love my.kindle<br />Thank you
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|The match of these two artists is unparalleled.  Both have superb abilities and compliment each other.  You won't be sorry you made this purchase.
B00B04NJI0|3.0|There is something misleading about the tongue-in-cheek title of \\"The ABCs of Death\\" (which is of course inspired by the \\"Ant and Bee\\" books). The short films (each about five minutes long) shot for this death-themed anthology does not have to be horrors. Some of the works here are comedies (mostly dark ones) or bizarre, experimental stuff. You just cannot expect something like \\"Masters of Horror\\" here.<br /><br />Like most anthologies, some pieces are great; some not so much. Segment \\"D\\" is all shot in slow motion. \\"K\\" and \\"T\\" are animated films. \\"G\\" and \\"U\\" employs a first-person viewpoint. Some are disturbing. Some are plain weird, especially three sections by Japanese directors \\"F\\" \\"J\\" \\"Z.\\"<br /><br />Here is the list of the names of 26 segments and directors who have contributed their pieces.<br /><br />A is for Apocalypse (Nacho Vigalondo, director of \\"Timecrimes\\")<br />B is for Bigfoot (Adrian Garcia Bogliano)<br />C is for Cycle (Ernesto Diaz Espinoza)<br />D is for Dogfight (Marcel Sarmiento)<br />E is for Exterminate (Angela Bettis, best known as the star of a cult horror \\"May\\")<br />F is for Fart (Noboru Iguchi, director of \\"The Machine Girl\\")<br />G is for Gravity (Andrew Traucki, director of \\"Black Water\\")<br />H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion (Thomas Cappelen Malling, director of \\"Norwegian Ninja\\")<br />I is for Ingrown (Jorge Michel Grau)<br />J is for Jidai-geki (Samurai Movie) (Yûdai Yamaguchi, director of \\"Battlefield Baseball\\")<br />K is for Klutz (Anders Morgenthaler)<br />L is for Libido (Timo Tjahjanto)<br />M is for Miscarriage (Ti West, director of \\"The House of the Devil\\" and \\"The Innkeepers\\")<br />N is for Nuptials (Banjong Pisanthanakun, director of the original Thai horror \\"Shutter\\")<br />O is for Orgasm (Bruno Forzani & Héléne Cattet)<br />P is for Pressure (Simon Rumley)<br />Q is for Quack (Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett)<br />R is for Removed (Srdjan Spasojevic, director of a controversial movie \\"A Serbian Film\\")<br />S is for Speed (Jake West, director of \\"Doghouse\\")<br />T is for Toilet (Lee Hardcastle)<br />U is for Unearthed (Ben Wheatley, director of \\"Kill List\\" and \\"Sightseers\\")<br />V is for Vagitus (The Cry of a Newborn Baby) (Kaare Andrews)<br />W is for WTF! (Jon Schnepp)<br />X is for XXL (Xavier Gens, director of \\"Frontier(s)\\" \\"Hitman\\" and \\"The Divide\\")<br />Y is for Youngbuck (Jason Eisener, director of \\"Hobo with a Shotgun\\")<br />Z is for Zetsumetsu (Extinction) (Yoshihiro Nishimura, director of \\"Tokyo Gore Police\\")<br /><br />Give it a try if you are interested in the names listed above. The anthology itself, overlong and inconsistent, is really a mixed bag. You will enjoy some segments while being not much impressed with the rest of the film.
1400052181|5.0|excellent.very insiteful.  Will recommend to others as a must read.  What more can I say...read it. Good gift for some on.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|Why does one like anything? Hard to say, but something everybody experiences at some time. Thanks fellas for another very brisk handling.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I love JB and adding the vocals of Beth Hart....a match made in heaven.  Beth's vocals are made for this kind of music.  I love the &#34;sultriness&#34; of her voice.  And when you add  the masterful playing of Joe, you can't get any better.  This CD has a musical smorgasbord  of choices.  It will soon be one of your favorites.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Perhaps the formula for the Lincoln Lawyer franchise is getting a bit stale, but the book is still an enjoyable read.

B009XY97VC|5.0|Words cannot explain how amazing Thomas and Nick's music is. Invincible started it all, now I just have to go buy Illusions!
B0000AKCLS|5.0|When we came upon Joe on a PBS special, we were awed by his abilities, and soon became fans for life.  If you are a fan of blues, then this is the CD for you.
B003ZYJS5Q|5.0|I can't tell you how good this sounds on my phono!  I'm shocked!  While listening to this I never miss stereo.  We may well have been fooled into believing that stereo or digital would somehow sound better.  This is the best surprise I've had since my first grandson was born on my birthday.
B004H83IM8|5.0|Awesome collection of slap stick comedy with Mike Myers at the top of his game.  Each film gets better and better with progression.  Can only hope #4 is still 'in the works'.
B00005R23S|5.0|I love watching Springsteen and the band perform. They are so alive. I felt as if I was there at the show.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I am on the 9th one now..  I love these books and the characters! I will keep reading more books!
B00DHHWY9I|2.0|Part of me wants to shout out ::: SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS, IT'S TOO MUCH, WAY TOO MUCH!  But then I'm just one lone voice, shouting from the distance.  When it comes down to it, this retelling of \\"The Great Gatsby\\", will most likely be a hit (for all the wrong reasons).<br /><br />I'm an opinionated old coot (born in 1955), who grew up listening to old movies, old music and reading old books.  I love Jazz, adore Gershwin, and other music from the 20's.  So I guess I've always been a little off key and out of step with so called popular entertainment.  That said, trash is trash regardless of when or how it's created.  Luhrmann's lurid retelling of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" fails miserably on so many levels it reduced me to tears.<br /><br />The soundtrack and music are jarringly uncomfortable and not even remotely close to the type of music popular during the 20s, let alone described within the pages of Fitzgerald's Gatsby.  It's almost as if Luhrmann believes Jazz is too archaic for modern (translation: younger) viewers to enjoy let alone comprehend.<br /><br />Technically stunning, with astonishing attention to detail, I'm saddened beyond words for what this movie could have been.  Gorgeous visual elements created by combining  20s achiaval film and graphics along with state of the art CGI and newly created film ::: all thrown together in a never ending frenetic 3D display.  Exhausting to watch, confusing to follow and boring in ways difficult to describe.  Simply too much excess, too much noise, too much bad behavior, too much vulgarity and too much of everything else.<br /><br />The visual effects out shine almost everything real in this movie.  The movie is filled with so much visual imagry, movement, music and noise as to obscure the actors.  For me, much of the movie's substance was lost in the cacophony.  In a way I felt as if I were watching a movie that had been filmed from a speeding car ::: everything's a bright vivid confusing and noisy blur.<br /><br />I found Luhrmann's schizophrenogenic version of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" difficult to watch and oddly depressing for ALL the wrong reasons.  But don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and then decide.<br /><br />The Cast<br /><br />Jay Gatsby: Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Gatsby.  I would have loved to see him act in a less manic movie.<br /><br />Nick Carraway: Tobey Maguire (an actor I admire greatly) comes across like a wide eyed nebbish totally out of his depth.  But then that could be how Luhrmann wanted him to act.<br /><br />Tom Buchanan: Joel Edgerton comes across as boorish, vulgar and lascivious in the extreme.  His considerable talents were wasted on this film.<br /><br />Daisy Buchanan: Carey Mulligan's performance is more a caricature of Daisy, than a living incarnation.  Mulligan's performances in other movies have been stunningly real, and a joy to watch.<br /><br />Myrtle Wilson: Isla Fisher, another actor who's talents are wasted in this horrid film.>I found Luhrmann's schizophrenogenic version of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" difficult to watch and oddly depressing for ALL the wrong reasons.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|One survives perfectly well without the other but this was probably one of the best sequel films ever made.  Just as funny if not more so the the original Vacation film.
0061438294|5.0|I have read another book related to this called, &#34;Liespotting&#34; and this book was noting compared to Joe Navarro's book. I recommend this book to anyone that has a passion for reading peoples non-verbal language. I'm only half way through this book and I have learned to many great things and I'm now observing my surroundings more than ever. Thank you Joe Navarro
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This thing is great! Simple setup and does just what Google says it will.  I gave it 4 stars because Google broke the third party app AllCast for Android - so now all you can cast from your Android phone is NetFlix, YouTube and Google Play - no local content and nothing from a Chrome browser on your phone. Sure would be nice to see support for Prime Video!! It's new... hopefully things will only get better!!
B00EDF43MY|1.0|Hard to navigate. Takes to long to go between levels.  Boring in a short time.<br />Only giving a one star.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I like Rush, not Jack Black.  Unfortunately this DVD has both.  Remove him and this is one of the best Rock-u-mentories ever produced.  With him it's still damn good.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Good crisp graphics, fun for a while then it is the same old thing.  Good to give a kid while in the car
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting, fun, cute and entertaining. Hours of fun with everyone's favorite yellow minions. Different courses add variety and cool boosters make it unique.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Love this game! Wish they had more like this that are free. I play this over and over I  Enjoy it so much.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I didn't expect it to be this good. The price was awesome and it was a steal. Thank you Amazon...
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|Beautiful old school rpg with a final fantasy feel. So much fun and addicting, only downside is one times a little buggy
0446576220|5.0|Easy read - great stories about how Zappos grew into the large company it is today (and is owned by Amazon)...
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Saw the movie twice and know I will want to see it again and again.  Cast was fabulous. and deserved their awards.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|When I first started this movie I thought that I was going to be bored and end up only watching half of it.  About ten minutes into it I was hooked!!! The story is so amazing!  One of the best films I've seen in a really long time!  I highly recommend watching.  Its more than just another boxing movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My Bible was worn and I had taped it up, so having this on my iPhone and tablet is great. I just take them to church and we can read along with our pastor, but can also change which version we want to read from.
1452110581|5.0|Though I am a dog person, I loved this book.  Even bought a copy for a friend. Would reccommend this book to anyone.
1408173352|5.0|I have tickets to see this amazing story of a boy looking for love.  He solves a crime and find himself on a journey all alone and out of  his comfort zone at such a young age.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is the best calculator app I've found so far! Makes figuring my checkbook so quick and easy. Love it!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|the king of pop had many number ones, but these choices are a good start, i really miss this guy, i really like this album i  think you will aswell, this is a feel good, pick me up type of album, pop it in and automatically feel good especially on those bad days we all have, i say buy this, the world needs more michael jackson influence.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|One of my favorite movie and I'm glad they did it right for Broadway a big smash and TONY AWARD winner to booth.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love using the Kindle apps on my iPhone, tablet and our computers, but mainly on the iPhone. So nice to have a book with me so I can read as I wait in line wherever.
B0014DFCMS|5.0|this movie has funny quarky music i think people would like teens mostly, i'm young at heart so i like it, great actors ellen page, michael cera, it  has a good message about teen pregnancy, and the choices you have, but i bought it more for the funny parts, and the fact that ellen page is in it. buy this it's really good especially for teens, it does a good job showing the hard choices teens could encounter if they got pregnant.
0770437400|2.0|Ok, so I love anything and everything zombie and I thought I would love this book. I tried, I really tried but I just couldn't get into it. I think I read 50 pages and gave up. I really can't explain the exact reason why I didn't care for it but I think the writing style had a lot to do with it. It's more of a fictional autobiographical timeline than a novel. I guess I will watch the movie :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Excellent design. If you wish to get beyond a certain point in point multiplier though, expect to shell out a little dough... and for certain ability granting costumes.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I am very happy with the app and would absolutely recommend it to others.  I am so glad that I found this.
B00BY8DC2A|5.0|i've been waiting for new material from these guys for a while.  completely psyched.  just wish they sold music vids..
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great book! I Thought it would be scary because its Steven King but it was amazing not scary at all!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this cd- learned about her from my brother, who know I look for new music. The only problem I had was when I received this cd, the case was broken. Luckily the cd was unharmed, but hopefully Amazon will be more careful, as this isn't the first amazon purchased cd that I have had this problem with.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Beautiful use of language, haunting story. I read it years ago and was very pleased to realize that Childhood's End is every bit as good a read as it was then.
0439023521|4.0|So it's one of those things, right? Like there's a movie and there's hoopla and all the rest. Well, I did my best to let that die down a bit (like I did with the HP novels) and I think I'm glad I did because I was able to sort of bring my expectations down to acceptable levels. I really, really enjoyed this book once I got to like the 3rd or 4th chapter. If you're new to the series I'd advise just giving it a minute and eventually you'll find yourself liking it quite a bit! :)
B000J10ER4|5.0|this superman movie has a bit of romance in it but i am a superman fan and i love it.  in this movie it is like he came back from krypton area and getting back in the hang of things after a few years gone.  still lots of action from start to finish.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Nice book. This was an intriguing read. Keeps you on your toes and I appreciated the story of his family waiting back home on word if he was alive or not and the connection he felt with his brother.  He loved his partners that were killed and he still carries the scars on his heart from it. I can't wait to see the movie and I'm reading adam browns book now.
B007Z9QP3K|3.0|Watch this.  It's worth it.  The captions get a bit annoying, but it's still good.  It made me feel like I was part of the Uboat group.
B000P0J09W|5.0|the 80's family every one loves.  about these kids that go on a treasure search and then they then run into crooks and 1 on them is a ogre.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Hd a coach recommend this book and boy I'm glad she did. This is a life altering book and I highly recommend it to all.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My husband and I saw this in theaters, and we fell in love with it. We bought it for our son for Christmas, and it's all he wants to watch anymore! The storyline is touching, and there's plenty of good laughs to be had. Love love love it!
B002436WFI|5.0|i like the terry pratchett movies they are usually full of humor.  one thing interesting about terry pratchett's book world is well it is flat held up by 4 elephants on the back of a turtle cool.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This guy was a hero. I wish I could have met him. So humble, not wanting to even admit he was a bad ass. This is a phenomenal book. Written well and you get the backstory and the buds story, although to be honest I wouldn't want to read about buds again. Chris RIP
1607053888|5.0|This is a great book, easy to follow directions and the bags are adorable. I hope she comes out with another addition.
B00005RDRO|5.0|in this movie they get all the best detectives together for 1 mission.  and try to see who is the best detective.
0060005696|1.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I like his Ted talk and this book comes highly recommended from several business type gurus but it bored me.
031603438X|5.0|If you've ever seen an interview with Keith, you'd never expect the quality of writing in this book. I've read a few of the rock star tell-alls, and this is my favorite yet. Let's face it, most of us don't travel the world, raising hell, having a great time, and getting paid well for it. Reading this allows us to tap into our inner Keith Richards, if only for a few hours before getting back to our normal lives.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I had to originally remove it because I was getting nowhere. But it looks like it's been fixed, so we'll see!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have been hearing about this book for years. I have wanted to read it for a long time and I am so glad I did. If you are wondering....read this now to be inspired!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I loved it all.  I can't wait for the next upcoming episodes,  I hope it will be an ongoing series.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you like Youtube and Netflix that's all it's good for. I use XBMC on my AppleTV. It's so much better.<br />XBMC is 10 years ahead of this thing. And it's free!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Came highly. Recommended and I tried it. I don't read much fiction anymore but this was a good one.  The ending left a lot to be desired and it felt rushed . Overall I can see why reached is popular
B00821OX98|5.0|Once I started watching this series, I was hooked. This season has action, humor and drama. I'm not usually into sci-go but I enjoyed this one.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|You got to see this Gone in 60 Seconds at least once a mo Jolie is hot and Nicola is one of my favorite actors. The movie just flows with the action you'll enjoy the music too.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Another great movie from the Kendrick brothers inspired by the Lord.  Once I watched it, I watched it three more time before putting it down.  Wonderful acting, great story, just wonderful overall.
0399255370|5.0|This is a great book for children!  I work at an elementary school library and am reading this book to students in grades 1 and 2 this week.  The book is written using letters from the crayons to Duncan - each crayon expressing their concern about being over-used, under-used, used carelessly (coloring outside the lines) or in the case of orange and yellow, disagreeing about who is the \\"true color of the sun.\\"  The students especially love the letter written by peach crayon since it expresses his dismay at being naked (Duncan removed the paper off the crayon).  I also have a lot of adults (parent volunteers, aides and teachers) visiting the library with the students and it is a hit with them as well!  This book has an AR level of 3.8, so it might be a little harder for the younger ones.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Had a hard time putting it down and had it all read in just a few days!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|loved it more the second time around. I had to rest my kindle and lost all levels 22nd but I liked it enough to try a second round.
B005LAII80|5.0|Great movie. Great Story. Great use of 3d.<br /><br />I ask everyone who purchased this film to sign the official online petition for the sequel and show the studio that we mean business when it comes to a sequel.<br /><br />Even purchase this for your friends and family at Christmas Time.<br /><br />Go on Netflix to watch the movie and give it a 5 star rating to keep the movie on there.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very well referenced, this book explains in detail complex concepts about food, medicine and nutrition,in an eAsy to understand language. If you are looking to improve your health, or are just interested in topics on diet and nutrition, this would be an interesting book to read. It is very informative, however, does not give specific recipes of wheat free dishes mentioned.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great movie. If you've seen &#34; The Wrath of Khan&#34; then you'll love the remake, nice twist from the orginal at the end as well.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I have seen a lot of movies involving a bank robbery, fast cars, cute ladies, and so on. But FAST FIVE is somewhat a little different because in this one, Mr. DWAYNE JOHNSON is joining the crew for the first time as a cop out for a manhunt by hook or by crook. His mission is to stop the team from robbing a police station and bringing them in using his full excessive force, especially on VIN DIESEL. WOW!!! DWAYNE JOHNSON vs. VIN DIESEL, now this is going to be one hell of a FIRE WITH FIRE and WALL TO WALL action scene.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The headset has a lot of awesome features and offers great sounds for a wireless system. The only problem I found with it was that is was very tight around my head. After about 30 mins I had to take it off because it was just too uncomfortable. I did return the item, just because it was too uncomfortable. Besides that, it a great product, something you'd expect to come from Logitech.
B0035JNTA6|4.0|Hilarious Ben Stiller in top form. Great work from ill Ferrell and a young Alexander Skarsgard. Overall 4 out 5 stars
B00124PXW8|5.0|Scary, great reprint, clearer, thought it was a soap opera it was so clear! It was all well worth it!
B000FC0P9E|4.0|As always Stephen King keeps you turning the pages! This book was brought home by my 6th grader...I was surprised since he got it from school....so I was willing to let him try knowing king can be scary reading (darn scary) and I downloaded the book to my kindle. The content was too mature for my boy and I made him find another book but I couldn't stop!!! Being from Maine he hit landmarks and captured the feeling of Red Sox nation...Great read
B003EY62II|5.0|I believe I own just about all the Scooby-Doo DVD out there my grandchildren and I set down every Saturday that they are here an watch a movie. I myself prefer the cartoon originals can't beat them they are the best, but have to say we all enjoyed this movie. If your a Scooby-Doo fan you will enjoy it too.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game will be the best $0.99 you will ever use.  I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind killing EVERYONE on earth.  Oh by the way you can buy stuff in game and if you do decide to buy something in game then buy the skull it unlocks a zombie version.  Hope this helps :)
B007EECSFA|5.0|My book club read this book for this month, and at our discussion meeting we all spoke highly of the authors ability to develop a great historical, romantic, mystery.  We had read two of her other books, which we all enjoyed.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great show! Wonderful cast and engaging story lines every episode. Make sure you've got the time to watch more than one episode.
0316017930|5.0|open well researched view, one with many levels for the mind to ponder, I want to purchase his other books
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I haven't seen it yet, but my dad thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to borrowing it at some point. Also really appreciate Netflix's business model of releasing it on DVD right after they stream it on their service.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was mesmerized by the story line, and was upset that I have to wait so long before Season 4 is out
B001E75QH0|5.0|perfect gift for my boyfriend. and now ive seen the movies and loved them!!! We loved that i got this!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well when I got this device last year I got this game right away. Then I got survival craft and it is really good even better than mincraft.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Sheryl's frank approach to the issues that women face at work motivated me from a place of anger to a place of action. We are responsible for much of the way we are treated in the workplace and there is much we can do as women to alleviate this.  This book is as much a memoir as it is a call to action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best app in the store to me maybe it's not as good as the computer but it is still a great app for your kindle
B0000524E5|5.0|This movie has a plot, action and music. It is really one of those movies one can put in and get happy just watching. The bottle flipping is just as good as the with the Tom Cruise/Bryan Brown movie. No overt sex just lots of action and fun.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|As usual Khaled Hosseini, entertains, educates and inspires. Moving as it does through countries and time this novel pieces together the lives of its characters in a way that is both moving and inspiring.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie held my attention because the sci fi backdrop was interesting enough, and there were enough novel things to see. But the identity, motivations, and complexity of the characters was utterly zero. I found myself rooting for the protagonist just because I knew that's who she was, but I couldn't care less about her two love interests, or her little sister, or anyone else, really.<br /><br />I find myself wishing I had spared myself the two hours it took to see the movie, and just read the book (which other reviews state provides much more character development).
B003G4W49C|5.0|I must say I do like the way this book is written. I am very impressed with the writing skills of Orson Scott Card. Magnificent
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Nice game to play, relaxing and just the right amount of :running around:<br /><br />to keep you thinking. Best thing it was FREE, but I would have paid for it
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is ok. There may not be a lot to this. But it is fun. If your looking for something that you don't need to do a lot of thinking then you will enjoy this game. So give it a try.
0786962984|5.0|I have played this for years and got the updated game.  It is a very simple game but seriously fun if you roleplay a bit with it, just like DnD. Figures for the players and monsters really make it awesome.  Ok.. ok... how can you roleplay with a game like this.  You creep down the hallway hearing drops of water in the distance, you approach a room, you look inside (DRAW MONSTER CARD) and see a giant purple worm!  It slithers over to you mouth wide open!!! I can't type any more too scared. (ROLLS DICE!)  Anyway, it does seem that certain classes have a huge advantage (cough... warrior and/or mage!) but the chance introduced by a roll of the dice is the great equalizer.  I have played and thought for sure I was going to win only to slide down through a trap door to a lower dungeon level and get utterly slain by a dark elf who takes ALL of my treasure.  This game is totally unpredictable and every time changes.  Go for it and try it out its cheap fun that lasts no more than an hour and is super easy to set up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is cute and fun, especially if you are a Dispicable Me fan and love minions.  I would definitely recommend it for any age.
B0075FLTV2|5.0|I Love George Michael, this selection of his greatest hits does not disappoint. George is certainly one the greatest singer songwriters of our time.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I loved this movie,  it's exciting, unpredictable, and visually amazing, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and adrenaline!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I picked up this book because it was recommended by a friend. After I started reading I could hardly put it down! The storyline is well written and detailed. Characters are also well developed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love jesus with all my heart since my life completely changed with my family and I love the Usa
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|This new August Burns Red album is just fantastic. It offers a well blend of old ABR while directly addressing the idea of \\"Creative Captivity\\" and growing as a band. Of course every artist has to change as they progress in fame and years while continuing to produce creative work. This band seems to have an open mind to all of the above and for that they will have a long and prosperous career. If you are a closed minded simplistic annoying metalhead then you will not like this release but you will be missing out for sure.<br /><br />Songs good for break downs include: Provisions,Count it all as lost,Fault line,and Animals<br />\\"Experimental\\" type songs:Treatment, Spirit Breaker, and Creative Captivity<br />Echoes is the anthem track on this album for sure.<br /><br />The rest of the cd is great also but I would start with the listed songs above when listening to this album. The only downside to this cd is that every song has the same song structure as far as when the songs slow down with a similar yet complex drum beat. If the next album continues with repeative pattern I feel the cd will lack, but its perfect for the time being.
B0000000LI|5.0|This is classic.  Hours of listening pleasure.  Always brings a smile to my face.  It's unique and I would recommend it to everyone.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love it but i would love to see a colt 1911 because that was the standard pistol for the u.s army
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|The audio is totally messed up. I'm having missing channels on the 5.1 surround (Right and Rear channels.)<br />The video even skips briefly during Vogue.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app notch made the game and he is the best man I know :):):):):):):):):):):)<br />:):):):):):):):):)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Trust me you won&quot;t waste your money.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The books are awesome the author really sucks you in and you can't stop reading. I couldn't wait to start the next one and see where Clary jace and Simon would end up
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Can put it down I love the game so much that my daughter said mom you been to put it up
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I enjoyed playing the game- although the actual playing screen could be bigger. On the second level it froze my kindle fire. I love Playrix games but this one I had to delete.
B008XX6J4C|2.0|Thought it was a little outside my personal taste.  I believed the reviews but it just wasn't up to my expectations.  Had the family listen also and I did for three more times but oh well. I know that they tried, just not for me.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I've been a fan since 1966 and this is the best of trek I've ever seen...just breathtaking and well acted..
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Excellent actors and beautiful costumes and scenery take you back to King Henry the 8ths  life.  You live in the tumultuous times and see upfront and personal the horrors of persecution, treachery, war and classes distinctions in England and Europe.<br />There was too much fairly explicit sex in the series for me.  Other htan that it was extremelly well done.
B000002C2E|5.0|This is a great album bringing back memories of late 60's and early70's. His music was so avant garde then and was delighted to hear some new early Dylan.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Received my Blu-Ray and CD of Madonna's MDNA 2012 World Tour today.  I haven't had time to watch the video of the concert yet, but the CD is outstanding!  I will be traveling this afternoon and can't wait to take it with me for another listen (or two) on the road.  If you were lucky enough to see the show live, it just makes it all the better.  What a great time in pop/rock music history!  Madonna's MDNA 2012 World Tour is definitely worth adding to your music collection.
B006M4F67A|5.0|The best Mahjong yet.  Fast and doesn't stall or quit out.  Not interested in paying for more games. Great easy.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Helen Mirren as &#34;Prospera&#34; is a wonderful and fitting twist to the classic play.  The visual effects are stunning and a difficult play to stage due to all the &#34;magic&#34; is perfectly adapted for the screen.  The roles of Trinculo (Russel Brand) and Stefano are very humorous and well played.  The costuming while traditional in lines also has many interesting modern twists such as the Neopolitan nobles in black leather with studs and zippers.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I am not into these movies at all but I bought this as a present and they love it! The quality is great and the special features are packed to the brim. If you are a die hard fan get this movie and enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this game. It really could use some work<br />The graphics are really good and that actions are amazing<br />I love this game
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This movie is awesome! I really do like all kinds of movies but find myself gravitating towards action, sci-fi, suspense and drama movies. I absolutely think this movie is awesome. I could watch it once every few weeks and be ok with it. Great plot and great acting. All the special features are great and it's nice having a Blu-ray/dvd combo pack! Good job with this one.
B000KIPT30|1.0|Behringer HA400 4-Channel Stereo Headphone Amp ...It is the worst thing I ever purchase in my entire life. I didn't check the product when was deliver, couple of moth later I decide to connect the item and the product work on just one audio channel. I was so stupid that I bought 2 of them. And now is too late to send it back. Safe your money, stay away from this!!!!
140006922X|5.0|loved it.  very informative book...reader friendly. it's always good to read these types of books because of the amount of research placed into getting the book ready and published.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Because I am such a geek girl, and watch shows like &#34;Heroes of Cosplay,&#34; I love that I can keep in touch with those cosplayers by following them on Twitter. I am also a writer, and I tweet about writing and the book I'm working on. I must admit - I don't check Twitter much on a day-to-day basis. It's mostly a fun distraction for me.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love this game....it is truly awesome...I play everyday...the only thing is that although it's a free game, you have to purchase these credit coins so I usually wait til the free scratch off cards are available. But, other than that...it's a great game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is cccooolll but there's a problem.<br /><br />Now you x-box &amp; pc players.You guys always think that this sucks.You should be thankfully that mojang made pocket edition (ex.if your pc or x-box acts up you can play MCPE).
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I like the movie better. The books r still good.<br />I wish they did make the rest of the series into movies
B00000K2UX|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and tought the soundtrack from it would be great as well.  The Berlin song, &#34;Take your Breath Away&#34; is awesome as are a few other titles on the CD.  Overall however, it was a disappointing purchase for just a few good songs.....
B00A3Z3KDG|5.0|I had never been very interested with Dicaprio's acting because of some of his earlier films in which he played a key role. After viewing Blood Diamond, I became a fan. Dicaprio has evolved into a fully atured actor reaching to the character's inner emotional conflict. He, indeed, has shown the multi-dimensional qualities that make the character believable. His co-star is also believable and emotionally mature enough to make this film such a great viewing opportunity.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|very easy to use and very helpful would use again thanks for the tips and making it so easy to use
B00AW0KGYI|2.0|This is a piece of crap. Do not buy this. If you do , you are putting your money down the stinky toilet.
1620404869|5.0|This is relatively short book that was a quick read while traveling for me.  I'm not a big reader and I usually set a book down after 1-2 chapters.  I loved the whimsy of this story and that the author seems to not take herself too seriously.  Looking forward to the movie.
B00EJX2YGM|2.0|These are the same movies as before. Why buy them again? So what if there are more special features. Save your money, its not worth it.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Over all &#34;for me&#34; nice sound track to relax too! I ordered it on line as it was just easy for me then going to the store....just me.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|There is little to like about this latest Star Trek movie, and I'm a life-long fan.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />This film is so unoriginal it copies the exact scene in \\"Wrath of Khan\\" where Spock dies, only reverses the positions of Spock and Kirk. It's Kirk who dies saving the ship from a warp core breach brought on by Khan. It even has Spock screaming, \\"Khan!\\" like Kirk did in Star Trek II. Then Kirk is magically brought back to life by Khan's healing blood. (I'm rolling my eyes right now.)<br /><br />The casting is bad. Khan was originally played twice by Ricardo Montalban, and he did a great job. He had a Spanish accent and a very well-developed body. Montalban was believable as a genetically enhanced man. The actor playing Khan in this film, Benedict Cumberbatch, has neither. When you're watching the film and you first learn Cumberbatch is Khan, you're left thinking, \\"HUH? This skinny guy?\\" He isn't believable. Couldn't they have found a Hispanic actor with a six-pack to play Khan?<br /><br />They threw in hottie actress, Alice Eve, to play Kirk's old flame, Carol Marcus, the mother of his love child, David. Sadly, Alice has no real role. She is simply eye candy. The writers could have explored the relationship she develops with Kirk, since we've never seen any of that, but no. Instead, we just see her in underwear.<br /><br />Then there's Kirk, who keeps flouting the rules, acting illogically and irresponsibly, but does so because he's so noble, so heroic. He's always risking his life for others. He cares so much he should have been a nurse instead of a starship captain. It isn't believable someone would get away with so much bad behavior from their employer (Starfleet) or have such luck.<br /><br />They need to stop making Star Trek movies. They are out of ideas.<br /><br />Note to producers: please don't put a vampire on the Enterprise in the next lame installment.
B000H1RFKU|5.0|I love this movie and this us the second copy I had to buy, I wore it out the first time!!! Love the Blu Ray.
B005VQRRYU|4.0|I was very hesitant to purchase at this price but did regardless.  It's expensive but there is so little out there in surround format that one's hands are tied.  I'd enjoy this even more if it wasn't so pricey.  Great sonics and performance!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and addicting no matter how old you are. Who can resist a free game that doesn't disappoint?!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|This game is so much fun. A must for any tennis fan. You don't have to spend cash to enjoy it, but even if you do its not a lot. Just get it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate the new upgrade.  Wish I could give it a zero.  I'm going back to Accuweather.  Reading the reviews...I see that I'm not alone.  I'm going to &quot;remove from device &quot;.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Ienjoy watching this program because if my grand kids walk in the room i don't have to worry because there is no sex to hide and no breasts hanging out of the ladies wardrobes!  True gentlemen and ladies; the world could use a lot more of this. The story is great and it has been fun watching what is going to happen next!  I can hardly wait for season 4!!
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|This comic is a must for anyone who likes the medium, or just great story telling in general. Once you start reading, you won't  be  able to put it down. I read it on one sitting. It really is that good. There are just some entertainment events that you look back and say: \\"where was I when that was going on, and why the heck didn't I get into it then?!\\" This comic is such an event. BUY IT.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case is absolutely amazing. You can do almost anything with your phone, even take a shower! Awesome!!! Everyone should try it.
B005DJREJS|1.0|Seems as if the entire show is based around sex ~ the message sent is in order to keep or get a male, one must have sex with them.  And this is at age 15!!!  Yes, call me old-fashioned and I prefer/recommend abstentionism.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|When was the last time the dev updated this app? On level select it says &quot;New levels coming soon&quot;, but they haven't. Keep adding levels if you want customers to stay interested!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is so much faster than watching Netflix through our Blu-Ray player.  The interface through our Blu-ray is slow and cumbersome, but with Chromecast the interface is the one you're used to on your phone or tablet, so scrolling thru selections is a breeze.  My 5-year-old mastered using it within a day.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Probably the best knife for the money! The quality of the knife if not the same, exceeds better than any high price knife! From the 1/4 inch high carbon steel thick blade that's runs from tip all the way to the back of handle, style, and shape you'll be amaze! Anyone who purchase this knife will not be disappointed! I love this knife!! This Extreme survival knife is extremely recommend it!! .. See any YouTube videos for it's performance!
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|This Movie doesn't really do a good job on character development and doesn't even bother to make the story make any sense. If you are a fan of Brad Pitt, you will probably watch it anyways. (**Spoiler Alert**) First off, there is one scene where they speak Spanish, this maybe an attempt to connect to the Latin audience, but they do an extremely poor job of character development. A boy looses his whole family, but he has no reaction other than being happy to be with Brad Pitt, no sign of any sadness for a boy who just lost his entire family. Next they go to Korea (maybe an attempt to connect with the Asian audience) because that was where the first broadcast of the word \\"Zombie\\" was used, but they don't really make it a World War type of movie. When they get to Korea, there are no Korean military present. Only the American military is there, this would have been fine if they left out the Koreans altogether and stated they were on a US military base in Korea, but the guy who brought the Zombie disease is a Korean soldier who went AWOL. If it was a Korean soldier who went AWOL, why are the US involved, that would be for the Korean military to deal with. The Physician who treats the Korean soldier is a Korean doctor, so why is he in the US military base passing on the disease. Why is the AWOL soldier and military doctor not in uniform, why were they not in a military hospital, instead they bring the doctor to some location that doesn't look like S. Korea. Did they catch the AWOL soldier in N. Korea? Why would the military doctor come alone without any soldiers. Where are the 800,000 Korean soldiers, why are the US soldiers the only ones alive. They could have made this part a really gritty military tactical World war with the Korean military, the Japanese military and the Chinese military. There was so much potential to really be a World War, you have a zombie breakout your in a country with a huge military/bunkers, with the most modern weapons ready to be used. On topof that they should have went with their original thought in the story line of the disease originating in East Asia. Another potential story line they missed out on. North Korean biological weapon gone bad or the world leaders of Stem Cell research experiment gone bad. (World leaders on stem cell research are S. Korea, Japan, Singapore and USA) There is so much we do not understand about cloning and stem cells. S. Korea is the  only nation which markets cloning for the general public, you can have your dog cloned there or make your cloned dog glow in the dark. (This is real, look it up) They could have ran with this type of interesting story line, should people be playing god by experimenting with stem cells or cloning...etc. A lab experiment gone bad would have been an interesting story. Next the UN survivors are mainly on a ship. S. Korea is a peninsula who makes 80% of the world ships (This is real, not a movie plot) They could have added these actual facts to make the story more interesting and have a huge Korean Navy battling it out with zombies, but instead they went with only a hand full of US military guys who are alive and the Asian guy was the one who went AWOL and contracted the disease. Odd, that they wasted so much potential, this region is a powder keg of military activity. Next you have a CIA who is in a Korean jail which happens to be next to the military bases medical center?, and the CIA agent knows what is happening in Israel (But he is in a Jail in Korea). How does he know this (No character development here at all).<br /><br />Now off to Israel, no reasoning for why they are going to Israel, they just are. Then the movie gets all religious for no reason. There are times when certain Zombie shows have gotten religious/Philosophical, but they did it well. 28 days later and Walking dead are good examples. In Israel they built a wall, no reason why they knew about the Zombie outbreak before it happened and why they built a wall, they just did. Now still not sure why or how Israel connects to Korea, but somehow this movie made non-sense into a story line. In Israel, nothing is explained other than East Asia is not where patient zero originated, they allude to possibly India as being the culprit. They are over run as soon as Brad Pitt shows up. At this point, I don't know where this story is trying to go. You get some religious scenes and we move on. If they followed 28 days later style where they wonder if God has abandoned them or they delve into the philosophical aspect of man and what he will do to survive, become a killer like a zombie to live...etc, then Israel might have had a point, but none of that.<br /><br />It seemed like 2 different zombie movie styles they were copying and failed at both. 1st was the military vs zombies and the 2nd was a religious/philosophical 28 days later type. They tried to mimic Dead Snow, 28 days later and Walking dead but failed to copy the best parts of these zombie flicks. The last part was actually pretty good. I like suspenseful zombie situations and the last part of the movie did a pretty good job of that, but there are some inconsistencies throughout the movie. Near the end it seemed like the zombies could open the doors to get to the stair ways, but in the beginning the zombies looked like dumb creatures who could not open doors. And in the beginning Brad Pitt got zombie blood on him and did not turn, but in the Lab a researcher gets zombie blood on him from a petri dish and turns, so which is it, does zombie blood turn you or not? And are the zombies not able to open door or can they? If I was to rank this out of See in Theater, Buy DVD, Rent or Pirate Bay. I would give it a solid \\"Rent\\" rating.<br /><br />Update *** Just found out why this movie didn't make sense in some scenes. Apparently, this movie was reworked multiple times and even the ending was changed. That maybe the reason why this movie did not transition from Asia to the Middle East well. In the originalversion they were going to allude that the disease may have originated in China, that is why when you see the Korea scene, it didn't make sense. A Korean soldier who went AWOL, but is not in military uniform and is not brought back to a hospital on a helicopter, instead the scene has them out in the middle of no where (with Chinese new papers in the background wall) without any military presence and they are not airlifted back to a hospital. (This was supposed to be China) The military physician is also not in military uniform. A 12 minute scene involving Russia was also deleted/edited down because that linked up with China as well. In addition, the CIA agent in jail is at the same facility as the medical area where they were taking care of the infected. That was supposed to be all prisoners and then it would have fit in with why a prisoner and the hospital are in the same room at a military base if the original infected was a Chinese man locked up for further investigation and he turned in the cell area. The studio was afraid they would not be able to market this movie in China if they insinuate that the disease originated there. It was a marketing decision/patch job and the China scene became Korea and we end up watching and thinking that was a weird non-sensical scene. I believe this has happened before with movie studios and there fear of China; the remake of \\"Red Dawn\\" was supposed to have China be the invaders, but that movie studio changed the invaders to N. Koreans after they realized, China was not pleased.**
B00E3UN44W|5.0|Original Gag Review: I couldn't believe I was picked to be an early reviewer, and it was a treat indeed!<br />The biggest spoiler that I still can't wrap my head around was the fact that Sherlock was so quickly able to disguise Moriarty's body as his own which he threw down the edge of the building.<br />The Sign of Three's biggest spoiler is that Irene Adler returns with what's left of Moriarty's criminal empire, including the black lotus and an even larger wave of serial killer taxi drivers.<br />Finally, in the Last Vow, of all the spoilers in the world, Sherlock confesses his love for Mrs.Hudson and their wedding is planned. The episode ends in such an amazing manner, such that even I of all people couldn't see the end coming(Mrs.Hudson is Moriarty's mom).<br />Genius writing, genius acting, definitely the best Sherlock series of all time.<br /><br />Real Review: I see an unnecessary amount of negative reviews for the first episode on here. I will admit that the formatting of the first two episodes is a rough divergence from the first two seasons. It does not however, mean that these two episodes are bad. They are in fact, great episodes, and I'd recommend watching them three times each before watching the season finale. It quite nicely ends the series and I was greatly satisfied with only one qualm(which is a spoiler so I wont talk about it here). I thoroughly recommend this series and this season is no exception. Genius writing, genius acting, definitely the best Sherlock series of all time.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|I gave it five stars because it was action packed all the way through, not as violent as some of the newer movies. The storyline is straightforward.
B0025WX2YW|3.0|Wonderfully portrayed historical presentation, well acted.  Costumes and sets are very credible.  And the story is fascinating.<br />This could be shown in classrooms, but nearly every episode has a graphic sex scene--totally unnecessary and<br />typically Hollywood.  Too bad that such a good historical drama is partly pornographic.
B00005RG6B|5.0|The product itself is very good and not so easy to find (luckily, there is internet).<br />Suggested to everyone who likes rock music.
B007R21JJK|4.0|Nice stable economic board. Boots pretty fast and bios is simple. Only issue I have with it is the usb ports on the back panel. I have over 14 usb devices (mixture of 2.0 and 3.0) and if I have all of them plugged in to the usb ports on the back the board will freeze and require a reset. I have all the latest drivers installed so thats not the issue. There are other usb problems that i have noticed but I will not list them all out here. Just be aware that those back panel usb ports can be problematic. The only solution i have found to the usb freezing problem is to use usb headers. I can plug a bunch of devices into the usb 2.0 header ports and the board will not freeze. Other than the usb issues I think its great.
0399162097|5.0|My advice, don't read anything specific about this book.  Seriously, there is a big surprise that comes somewhere in the first third and I didn't know about it and it was wonderful to be shocked.<br /><br />Now I will praise, VAGUELY.  Because I don't want to spoil the surprise.  I found the characters beautifully drawn and I loved the narrator.  I would hang out with Rose, she is wonderful and has a great voice.  I would read about these people even if this were one of those slice of life type novels where things that have happened to any of us happen to the characters.  But this is not one of those novels, the plot of this book is so well done and so tight that I could barely wait to pick it up again.<br /><br />If I were you, I'd stop reading this review and start reading the book already. It is worth your time, your money, and your attention.  Loved it.
140006922X|4.0|A very historically consistent recitation of the volumes of data points on the &#34;historical&#34; Jesus of Nazareth.  As a deeply faithful person (Christianity) it has been a major part of my spiritual growth to learn as much about my fait and the critical differences between that and the varying religions.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this positioning of Jesus of Nazareth as a historical figure of mankind and not addressing Jesus the Christ by a Muslim author is not novel at all and is the basis of Islam where Jesus Christ was not God but another in a line of prophets proceeding Mohammed.  I offer no judgment, just an important nugget of truth that folks need to consider in consuming this well written and accurate book with proper perspective.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library because I read a good review in Bookpage which gave the premise of the story and while it didn't spoil it for me I think it's always better if you can just drive right in a book and be surprised.<br /><br />If you've read what this book is about and think maybe you don't want to read it  because there might be too much of an ick factor there isn't.  The author does address the serious issues raised but they are not dwelled on  or overly preached.  I just thought it was a wonderful book with a story you just couldn't predict.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|WHY, WHY, WHY does anyone like this movie? I found it unfunny, unoriginal and most of all REPULSIVE. That whole part about the characters who are stand-ins for porn actors is probably the most disgusting scene in any supposedly \\"romantic comedy\\". What on earth is funny OR romantic about that? Hollywood studios are just in a contest to outdo each other in lewd and immature content in their films, and this film definitely shows it. I wish I could erase it from my memory!

159562015X|5.0|I've done many of these types of self exam things, this was the best.  Not only did I find out my strengths but I found out things to watch out for within my strengths.  I purchased this for my 7 employees, we all enjoyed the information we got about ourselves.  This was a good team builder
1476733953|5.0|I don't need to add to all the others who have written, just wanted to join in to say that this book is great. It was donated to my library and I decided to read it. Could not put it down. Immediately bought Shift for the library. I will be talking this one up to everyone!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed every page. Quick page turner. Every guess I had was wrong about where the book was heading. I would read this book ten times over.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had never heard of the Orphan Trains before and was fascinated that they were a part of history for 75 years but little is written about them. I picked this book for my book club and everyone loved it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Music and singing was superb.  The movie lends itself to more special effects than the stage play.  Actors did a fantastic<br />job.  The story is timeless.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This movie is in now way like the original and in no way as entertaining. I expected so much only to be disappointed. Time for another reboot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can't get enough of this! Crafts and recipes and gift ideas... it never ends! I've learned many things and keep finding more that I want to do!
B0023AO5JC|5.0|I'm not really into black and whites, but this movie is fantastic! Fritz Lang did a great job and Peter Lorre was fantastic! I still can't believe that this film was made in only six weeks! This a must watch.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app cleans/clears memory, cache and SD storage leftover by other apps.  Very simple-to-use options that safely clean your Kindle Fire and Clean Master has advanced features for those expert users who how to run them..
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I like this movie, it was better then what I expected and I enjoyed it. I didn't waste my money watching this and I think you won't either.
B0039O8AQK|4.0|Too bad Americans cannot see we are inviting this same thing to happen in our country.  We have already re-written the greatness American history and replaced it with diversity bunk.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|When I found out that Matt Damon wasn't attached I was upset, but after watching this film I understood and saw the light! Jeremy Renner's character isn't Jason Bourne, which came at a relief for me. Jeremy plays Aaron Cross, another soldier who was just like Bourne. Anyhow, watch it for yourself and see, this movie is awesome and won't come at a disappointment.
031623480X|5.0|Occasionally there will be a book that will come out of nowhere, get published, and ultimately shared with the world that goes on to quite literally change the course of the future by dramatically shifting the way we live our lives on a daily basis. And when that book is one about a subject as critically important as our health and is based on a strong foundation in solid, scientific nutritional principles, the significance of that event becomes magnified well beyond just some fascinating part of mankind's literary history.<br /><br />A book of this magnitude provides perhaps some of the most life-changing information that could very well tear down some of those long-held, deeply-rooted societal modes of thinking that have become such a mindless part of the conventional wisdom of our day. These common ideas that make up our basic cultural belief system are sometimes dead wrong and need to be corrected through proper education and a bit of convincing to get people to make a change when change is warranted. Although trying to alter what people believe about anything is a proverbial uphill battle, it can, it must, and it has been done many times before.<br /><br />Here are five key nutritional health books that would fit that paradigm-shifting criteria released in the past 100 years:<br /><br />- [[ASIN:0916764206 Nutrition and Physical Degeneration]] by Dr. Weston A. Price<br /><br />- [[ASIN:0143125184 Pure, White, and Deadly: How Sugar Is Killing Us and What We Can Do to Stop It]] by Dr. John Yudkin<br /><br />- [[ASIN:0470913029 The Paleo Diet Revised: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Foods You Were Designed to Eat]] by Dr. Loren Cordain<br /><br />- [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health]] by Gary Taubes<br /><br />- [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]] by Dr. William Davis<br /><br />Now we can add to that prestigious list yet another one that can and should be influential is changing the minds of everyone who reads it-LITERALLY! It's called Grain Brain: The Surprising Truth about Wheat, Carbs, and Sugar-Your Brain's Silent Killers by a famed neurologist named Dr. David Perlmutter. The information contained in this book is some of the most comprehensive, cutting-edge stuff on how the body works, the impact that nutrition plays on it, and why everything we do about our health really boils down to keeping our brains functioning at the highest levels. I hope you're ready for what you are going to read in Grain Brain because it has the great potential to change everything you thought you ever knew about diet and health. Hold on tight, the information in this book is Earth-shattering stuff but incredibly relevant now more than ever before!<br /><br />As someone who follows the very latest information on nutritional health through my work at \\"Livin' La Vida Low-Carb,\\" most of what I read in Grain Brain was not new to me. But for the general public who has unfortunately not been enlightened to this yet, the idea that the consumption of carbohydrates, even from the so-called healthy sources such as whole grains, is directly responsible for destroying the brain is mind-blowing! With people dutifully consuming copious amounts of these \\"healthy\\" whole grains along with the Standard American Diet consisting of other carbohydrate-rich foods such as refined flours, sugars and starches while simultaneously eschewing truly healthy real, whole brain fuel foods that contain sources of dietary saturated fat and cholesterol (such as eggs and fatty red meats), Dr. Perlmutter puts forth the notion that this has led to debilitating and incurable brain diseases such as dementia. And he says it is completely preventable if we flip the dietary advice we've always heard is healthy on its head-cut the carbs and increase the fat in your diet! Because you can't undo the damage that's done to your brain once dementia sets it, it is incumbent upon you to take action on this NOW while you still have your mental faculties to do so.<br /><br />Grain Brain makes a rather compelling case to shift your diet away from the consumption of grains, sugars and other culprit carbohydrates that are leading to the early signs of neurological health problems such as migraines, seizures, mood changes, sexual dysfunction, and ADHD which then progresses to more advanced issues like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. How many of us have watched friends and family members deal with this exact thing and wondered how it could possibly be happening? We chalk it up to old age, but what if what we're eating right now could be the very thing that leads us down a similar path to neurodegeneration? That's precisely what this book is trying to help you prevent from happening.<br /><br />Although blood sugar is generally seen by most people as something only a diabetic needs to be concerned about, Dr. Perlmutter contends that keeping it within a range of 70-100 mg/dL is ESSENTIAL to maintaining proper brain health (and getting a glucometer to test your blood glucose levels is so incredibly easy by getting a monitor from your local Walmart or pharmacy-EVERYONE should own one of these devices and know what their blood sugar is doing). He recommends several other critical health tests you need to be asking your doctor about if you want to protect what's in that head of yours! As you read through Grain Brain, you'll begin to realize why these tests are so important, how controlling chronic inflammation is the ultimate goal, what dietary changes are necessary that will very likely go against everything you've ever heard before about nutrition and its relationship to your health, and some rather simple things you can do to attain mental stability and literally rehabilitate your brain from the damage you've inflicted upon it because of your poor nutritional choices. It may not be too late if you take the advice of this brain health doctor who has seen thousands upon thousands of patients get their life back again by implementing easy dietary changes that radically improved their health and life forever.<br /><br />If you're concerned about how to do this, Dr. Perlmutter doesn't leave you meandering in the wilderness with what is very likely brand new information to so many people that he provided throughout Grain Brain. He offers up a Four-Week Plan Of Action in the back of the book that walks you through everything you need to do to get back on track again. From testing to supplementation, cleaning out your kitchen to restocking it with the truly health foods (again, he's redefining what \\"healthy\\" means), and even a few words on the benefits of engaging in intermittent fasting (GASP!)-what to do and why you're doing it is very clearly explained in language that just makes sense. Don't be afraid to give this a go for yourself. It could very well enhance and extend the length and quality of your life more than any drug you could ever take in the name of getting healthy.<br /><br />Grain Brain is destined to become an instant classic as a key paradigm-shifting nutritional health book that will be revered for many years to come! GET YOUR COPY TODAY and start experiencing the kind of health you deserve.ia sets it, it is incumbent upon you to take action on this NOW while you still have your mental faculties to do so.<br /><br />Grain Brain makes a rather compelling case to shift your diet away from the consumption of grains, sugars and other culprit carbohydrates that are leading to the early signs of neurological health problems such as migraines, seizures, mood changes, sexual dysfunction, and ADHD which then progresses to more advanced issues like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|This film is remarkable and left me speechless. I think that this film is perfect when it comes to plot, character arc, setting, acting, directing and so forth. You want a movie to remember, watch this film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do an outstanding job portraying the characters they were given. Beautiful movie!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This show is amazing!  I love it.  I was worried about buying this dvd because everyone was saying PBS cuts the episodes, but I dont think that happened on this edition.  It was a good set and I cant imagine anything was cut out.
B00448SE4S|5.0|This movie was hilarious when I first saw it! I like it because it imitates a video game so well and it felt like an original movie! I think anyone who enjoys fun movies will enjoy this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I also wrote this on the season two disks but I feel the same way: This show is amazing!  I love it.  I was worried about buying this dvd because everyone was saying PBS cuts the episodes, but I don't think that happened on this edition.  It was a good set and I cant imagine anything was cut out.
B00130UFY2|5.0|I love the Bourne series, every single one, even the new one! This one is epic and you will not regret watching it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Decided to try watching something new and different. Although the effects and acting are really not great at all, the plot and overall emotion of the show pulled me in and I loved it! Very very good!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I think this is worth watching for anyone who has enjoyed and continue to enjoy Batman. I was impressed with the storyline and I must admit that even in cartoons Batman continues to surpass Superman.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book!!! However, it does seem to be written by an 8th grader. All together this book was great.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great movie from beginning to end. Liam Neeson is kick ass in this movie! Watch it if you're the 3% of the world that hasn't already.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun. I love the interactive parts. The trading and shows are my favorite.<br />I highly recommend this game.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|This movie is raw, beautiful and powerful! This is a movie I can watch over and over again. If you're looking for a good action film this is it! This is the second time that Will Smith turns down a movie, that in my opinion would have helped strengthen his career. The first being the Matrix now Django, what a shame and I am glad that he did turned it down because I could not imagine anyone else in this role other than Jamie Fox. Great movie, watch it!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This happens to be quite the nice app. It's actually quite organized, it's a huge contrast from the last notebook app I had because it only let me make 5 notes.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|This is not an academy award winning film, but for understated pure humor, this film rocks! I would recommend this for anybody who likes slapstick, action-packed, humorous movies!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I originally watched this movie on Netflix and when I went back to watch it again, it was no longer available. Luckily, Amazon had it and really appreciate that. I think this is a great movie and a moving story.
0399255370|3.0|Here's what I loved:  The childlike writing and mix of cursive and printing (looks just like the way my 10 y-o writes), the illustrations and the concept.  All wonderful!<br /><br />I was having a great time sitting with my 5 y-o artist and she was very keyed in on the story until we reached the pink page.  I admit I actively try to avoid exposing my daughters to stereotypes and I also admit that (most - not all) young girls' do in fact love pink (guess what? I even know boys who love pink! Shocking, I know).  But really, is that all you could think of?  To say that pink is a girls' color?!  And, to compliment the girl for drawing inside the lines?  My first instinct was to change the words on the page but instead I read them word for word as they were written and my daughter simply said, why didn't Duncan draw a pig, aren't pigs pink?<br /><br />If I could re-write the book: I'd select a gender neutral character like a Bailey or Ryan or Kai.<br /><br />Final complaint: Most young kids don't know about letter grades.  Where we live they don't even use letter grades until they are in the 4th grade.  Rather than giving Duncan an, \\"A\\" for coloring and an, \\"A+\\" for creativity, I think Duncan would have been more satisfied with praise for doing his best, for taking his time, for filling an entire page with details.  Even a remark of, \\"Wow! I see you worked really hard on that!\\" by his teacher would be more realistic from the perspective of a young kid.<br /><br />I love the black rainbow and orange whale and all of the non-traditional use of colors on Duncan's final picture.  I was relieved to not see a pink princess although there is a princess driving a pink plane.  Oliver Jeffers favorite color of \\"striped\\" really comes through in the end.<br /><br />Overall, a great idea for a book but I wish I would've checked it out at the library before my purchase.
B00E5C3AJM|4.0|While I really enjoy the game, I was disappointed that the majority of the new items for sale require diamonds to purchase. I have been playing almost daily since it became available for Kindle and can't seem to get enough diamonds  to purchase the more expensive items. Each time I seem to get close to 400, they disappear into thin air. I have still not had the opportunity to purchase any of the items that I would like to with diamonds.  The money and level advancements aren't much fun if you can't do anything with them.<br />The graphics are great. The fashions are terrific. I think that the new eyes and lips are cool. They give some nice options.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren; how could you go wrong!!<br /><br />  I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis, but he's really good in this.  I've always liked Morgan Freeman, but fell in love with him in this role.  Malkovich simply doesn't make a movie in which he is anything less than fantastic and his interplay with every actor in this just plain makes this a movie you don't want to miss.  As for Helen Mirren, there's no female actor who can play any role better and she doesn't let us down here.  This woman's talent is amazing!<br /><br />  Mary Louise Parker has never made a big impression on me, but she really holds her own with the powerhouses I spoke of above.<br /><br />  If you want to have fun watching a movie with lots of action, daredevil stunts and a really good script while still managing to not take itself too seriously, I can't recommend &#34;Red&#34; highly enough.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Reliable, inexpensive, nice looking watch. Good as casual watch, especially for every day work. So far working perfect. Would recommend to friends.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|This one did not disappoint. I've all but stopped buying full albums because there's usually only a couple songs I like. But the whole thing is great. 30 seconds to mars is still going strong and growing better each album.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I am a longtime fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.  Once Brandon Sanderson became the finishing author of The Wheel of Time, I found that I enjoyed his style and energy as well.  Upon finishing the final book in my long-time favorite series (A Memory of Light), I was in need of something new to try. I thought I should delve into Brandon Sanderson's other works to see what they were made of - so glad I did! Mistborn is excellent!
0385523394|5.0|interesting story... not exactly like the fictional work on netflix but a good read non the less.  Fun to see how the adaptation of real life and television come together.
0385347774|1.0|I am so glad that I procrastinated.  I was about to recommend this book to all of my friends, and order more books by this author.  Then something happed that changed my mind: I finished the book.  This is one of the worst endings I have ever read, what a bitter disappointment after an otherwise enjoyable read.<br /><br />Early in the book I could not understand what all the fuss was about.  Okay, I get it, men are pigs.  Then the story took off and there were more twists and turns than a rollercoaster, more surprises than a funhouse.  I could not put the book down and kept telling my wife how good it was, insisting she had to read it.<br /><br />Then the ending.  The author is clearly talented so I can't understand why she couldn't come up with something better than this.  And it's not that I need a happy ending, I mean Hemingway and Steinbeck are two of my favorite authors.  But this was so contrived and unbelievable, and it's like the author went way out of her way to make the ending irritating just so it would stand out.  There are so many unbelievable, inexplicable incongruities that are overlooked because, presumably, the cops bungled the first case so bad that nobody will question anything else going forward.  And we're supposed to believe that Amy is now happy living in this hick town with her hick neighbors just because she now has a \\"Stepford Wives\\" husband?  Please, don't insult us.<br /><br />It feels to me like an ace pitcher blowing a no-hitter in the ninth inning, not because he lacked the ability but because he lost interest and just wanted to go home.  So close to being something really special, spoiled so quickly.  I'm sure the author knows she compromised an otherwise brilliant piece of work just to make it \\"different\\".  If I could say anything to the author it would be:<br />`I feel sorry for you'<br />`Why?'<br />`Because every morning you have to wake up and be you.'  Ha!
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|It's a shock to me. Every time I watch a BBCAmerica or BBC Cop Series, they seem to get to the end of solving a grisly crime without guns.  I am a member of NRA but see now that we in America are all overarmed, especially our law enforcement system.<br />WONDERFUL SHOW, WILL KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT AND WAITING FOR EVERY EPISODE.  THE way they weave each character's personal life, good and bad into this show makes it POP.
B002GMSMHS|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted!<br />It took a while to get here but considering the fact that it was actually shipped from China I guess it's ok.<br />I had been looking for this card for quite a while -It's very rare- because my camera is kind of old but I love it<br />This guys even took the time to add a detail in the shipment that made my day!<br />Thanks!<br />I will definitely buy from you again...
B000SW2F6M|2.0|The previous review re:  the Film Kingdom of Heaven should be deleted.  The reason for the poor streaming are no longer valid.  Rupert Taylor
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Each interview was a story that could stand alone, or become another book.  Would War Z is one of the best Zombie books so far, I couldn't put it down.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|You need this to be able to see what you are recording or taking pictures with your GoPro.  This works on my GoPro3 and an older GoPro.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|If you have a nexus four and are using appradio, this is the only interface that will work.  I haven't tried using the wifi hotspot yet from samsung,, which works as a substitute for the mhl interface with other phones.  It is very expensive and, at the time of my purchase, could only be bought new from Japan.  I settled for a MORE expensive USED product for delivery within the states.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Had to get a replacement for google reader because good had the nerve to close reader down. I moved over to feedly and it made the loss much less painful. the only suggestion is I miss searching through just my feeds
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Due to the popularity of this device I had to wait months to get it. I can say it was worth the wait. But not in a jump up and down, it was worth the wait, it's going to change my entertainment lifestyle kind of way. Just mild excitement at this point<br /><br />My biggest concern is not with the technology. It's pretty solid, easy to set up as long as you have a power outlet near your device and a strong internet signal.<br /><br />It's with the content providers catching on to it and developing more and more apps that allow you to &#34;cast&#34; their content. Youtube and Netflix only hold your attention so long. If Hulu and others content providers adopt it, it will change my entertainment lifestyle quite a bit.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THe kids love this game, and I enjoy playing it as well. Much more complex game than I expected. My 2 yr old likes collecting the bananas and my 6 yr old like achieving new levels.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Watch it all the time. Love it!
B004XZR63M|4.0|This book was more motivational than educational. Not much on specific how to but some good examples. That said, who doesn't need motivation? Good book to add to your get rich collection. I agreed with a lot of the authors thought process.
0739378341|5.0|I devour Grisham's books. His delivery, pace and intrigue captures the reader's attention from the first paragraph. This story did not disappoint. Loved it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two brings the Abby closer to the modern world. While class distinction is still part of the norm, times are a changing!!<br />Women are working to get the vote.  We see the struggles of Mr. Bates against the dishonest prison guards.  This season shows how the guards, feel they have the right to make Mr. Bates life a nightmare. The court system is thing to watch and marvel at.<br />Clothing is changing and becoming less restricted and less formal. Childbirth is still a nightmare for women, with the men deciding who and what the Dr. can do.  This is decided sometimes by if the Dr. has a title not on his skills. I would watch this  season again and again, and i have!
0142428280|5.0|I really was skeptical of moving into the 20th century but he does a wonder job of portraying numerous views of the WWI era.  Fall Of Giants is a very enjoyable read.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|this book was a delight. i loved it as much as the first one. it keeps you wondering what they're going to get into next.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|It has a nice mix of science and adventure. It has a little bit of a slow start but really picks up past episode 8. If you like SG-1 this will be a perfect series to start with next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is an awesome mobile game. And very fun to play everyone should get it its epic you will love this minecraft if you dont have a computer
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm clock app works very well, it helps with a lot of daily functions, set multiple alarms and is just a great app to have if you need to set an alarm for any reason.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|They say that in war one experiences 10% terror and 90% boredom. It isn't quite like that in this book but there are episodes that are really terrifying interspersed with long stretches of 'background'. Much of the background is useful if only it wasn't quite so long winded.<br /><br />The characters are well drawn, especially the main character and the scenes are well researched. The book is certainly worth reading.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downtown Abbey is the best series on television. With the dearth of &#34;reality&#34; television shows, Downton Abbey is a wonderfully written series in an age of historical importance. It is not hard to get involved in the lives of all the occupants of the series-those you love and those you love to hate. The estate, surrounding countryside, and other locales provide rich backgrounds for the ensuing dramas. Well done, Public Broadcasting. I am watching and supporting the network with quality programs such as Down to Abbey.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book just picks up from where the first one left off....was hard to put down the books until I had read all three.  Was a roller coaster of  emotions starting from sad, funny, angry...to make it short I think I went through every emotions known to a person.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I like the fit and the locking strap.  Keeps my daughter's kindle fire secure and protected from drops and wear.  Price is good and build is pretty decent.  Good deal.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I could not put these books down....the first book as I said before was a slow read...but after that I read the other 4 ...way to fast...and wished some of the endings were different....but over all I wish he would write some more books caring on with the characters in &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A book well written with many characters and moving parts!  Many mini stories all wrapped up in the big picture!  Entertaining!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|By the time I got to this book I had picked up on being able to understand what things were in the time setting and understood more, so I didn't have to read so slow or reread or look up things to understand....and when I got to watch the HBO series ...I could put a face with the characters and knew exactly what was going on.
1400052181|5.0|It was a very eye-opening book ... I had never heard of HeLa cells or about the life of Henrietta Lacks and her children, and I'm so glad I know this now. I recommend this to everybody ... it was a truly enriching experience.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book, although A LOT racier for my liking, told of heartache and how people deal with abuses starting from childhood.  I can't wait to see the movie...although I dunno :P if they can tell the story as well on screen as was in the book!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so awesome I can't stop playing it. I love how you can  change Barry from classic Barry to rock star.
0399159347|5.0|I really enjoyed this book but I was very reluctant to read it as the description was not tremendous.<br /><br />I liked the way the book related to day to day lives and secrets and lies in all families.<br /><br />I thought the layout of the book was a great way to keep the reader gripped, the way it kept switching to the different characters, it made you want to keep reading so you could find out what happens.<br /><br />It has some fabulous twists throughout the book which just made the book a brilliant read.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Read the books first, then gave the show a shot. I have not been disappointed! I can't wait for more!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a good small pocket type blade sharpener that features a fold out tapered round diamond-coated rod for sharpening serrated and standard edges also it has one set of carbide blades for quickly restoring a dull edge and one set of ceramic stones for finishing the edge.
0439023491|1.0|I imagine that the book is a good read, but I can't tell you a deep opinion cause I never got it....
B008478VE8|5.0|It's the first book of the science bible. A must read. A gift of insight for us all to enjoy and learn from.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I truly love this game. Love the different animals,and the goals are doable. I recommend this game to everybody! Good game to occupy your time but not consume it. Try it, what do you have to lose? Make your island of ice just how you want it. Show your imagination. Besides the fact that you get to make families, there is a fun side game.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book was really well written and descriptive. To me though, the beginning started off real slow to the point where my mind would wander elsewhere. Only after he got through the loop at the island did I really get pulled in and get excited about reading more of it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My 7 year old granddaughter, Kaleigh, told me about this.. went to Amazon on my Kindle Fire And got the hook-up. It's cool to see how much battery life you're  using on different programs...music, video, games, books etc. Great app. No problems here in VA.
B0082Z447U|1.0|This book was free so I started reading it.  Couldn't get into it.  Didn't finish.  It was boring and I couldn't find an interesting plot.
0385335482|5.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic is a funny and witty novel by Sophie Kinsella. It follows the misadventures of Rebecca Bloomwood, financial journalist who is hopeless when it comes to her own finances! WHAT A FUN READ!!!!<br /><br />When a hapless and obsessive shopper is confronted with her failing finances, she struggles to reel herself in! Rebecca is anything but unintelligible, but for some reason, she finds herself emotionally dependent on the thrill of shopping. She is also a financial journalist doing the bare minimum to keep her articles in print, copying press releases verbatim and avoiding any ACTUAL journalistic endeavors. It's mostly a story of her misadventures in love and money.<br /><br />Seriously loved this book. It's not ground-breaking, it's not a classic, but oh, my, what a funny, laugh-out-loud novel! I can't wait to read the next in the Shopaholic series!<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
B0009P66TK|5.0|Great watch, heavy case, leather strap, easy to understand and set.  I needed a better watch and this fits the bill.  I am a &#34;Righty&#34; but the buttons on the &#34;Lefty&#34; side keeps me from hitting them unintentionally.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|This Brit has excellent voice and this cd has some of her hits.  You should make part of your collection.  I did.
B003DWU98U|5.0|I just love this movie. Elizabeth Taylor gives a riveting performance of Martha that just draws the viewer in and makes you never want to look away. Each time I watch it I learn something new about Martha and George and how dynamic their relationship is. I recommend this film to everybody. I also encourage people to read the play!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't have the opportunity to watch TV often and missed Downton until this year. IT'S FABULOUS!!! The writing, story lines, characters, costumes, acting - all worth the investiture of time. Thanks Amazon for scooping-up the rights!  Now just try to get it on this side of the pond at bit earlier :).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book was amazing. It was so captivating and intriguing. It was very relatable. I'm excited to read the next book.
0439023521|5.0|I thought this book was very engaging and had a very unique storyline! Definitely a must read, in my opinion (:
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book.  Sparks did a great job with vivid descriptions and describing the characters' thought and feelings.  Very suspenseful and  a page turner.
0525478817|5.0|My daughter is reading this book and absolutely loved it, she read the book in 2 weeks! This was one of her summer reading choices for school and would recommend it to others to read.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I am giving this app a 4 star rating because I like it and it's relaxing but it freezes up on me. I like the fact that I can adjust the number of pieces so that I can do a quick puzzle or make harder when I have more time. This app offers a lot of free puzzles &amp; even has a mystery style puzzle. You don't know what it is until you finish it. Sometimes I have is that the app freezes on me which is irritating but it it only lasts a few minutes. There is a puzzle selection gallery. Completed puzzles display as a photo un-opened or incomplete ones display as a puzzle with missing pieces. That's how I track which ones I have completed. A few times puzzles that I completed were still displayed as incomplete on the gallery page. All in all I still like it and use it 4 times a week.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|I am learning a lot about Nigeria and its fight to be a democratic nation.  What the ordinary and unordinary citizens went thru
B00DXP0QX0|2.0|I love Stewart's early recordings on Mercury as well as the Faces material on Warner. The tunes here, mainly out takes and alternate versions of music from his Mercury recordings, add nothing to his legacy. Poor sound and lesser performances don't make up for the occasional lost gem.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have read this book 3 or 4 times now...every few years I come back and read it again, and every time I get caught up in a magical land....it is informative, but mostly it is just plain fun for a few days...i have read lots of other books, fiction and non-fiction, on feudal Japan, but this is by far and away the best...
B001AQR3JY|5.0|My daughter is in love with The Lion King and we've been looking for a DVD copy for over 3 months at stores. Amazon carried it for a reasonable price and it shipped quickly.
B008JFUTT0|3.0|I get it, this is a truly incredible story, as the cliche goes - truth is stranger that fiction and Rodriguez is definitely a interesting and lovable person.  The movie and story was well done, but it didn't answer some dangling questions out there. 1) Like where did all the money from the album sales go.  They did interview the one record company (Sussex) and he danced around the question and that was the last heard of it. 2)No statistics where provided like albums sales, no reviews in magazines showing him on any charts in South Africa, no data on radio play, etc.<br /><br />It seemed like more a quest of a few guys who liked Rodriguez's music and made it appear like a much larger than life character.  They were saying he was the Elvis of South Africa, to me it seemed like the Elvis of a few guys and liked by a few hundred more.<br /><br />Some of the interviews seemed contrived.  He was signing autographs and a lot of the people in the audience where young, born well after his \\"stardom,\\" so I don't understand how they would be fans.  The concert, although impressive for attendance, seemed like people where they just for a fun concert, not that they were there to see a \\"legend.\\"<br /><br />I hate talking bad about Rodriguez, because he is such a great person and a wonderful personality.  But honestly the reason his music didn't catch on in USA is because he music isn't anything ground breaking.  He seems like a poor man's Dylan.  He lyrics are nothing spectacular, he singing has a lot to be desired and his guitar playing can be done by thousand other guitarist at the time.<br /><br />But all in all it was a movie worth watching.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I use a Kindle Fire when not at my computer, I receive PDF, Word and Excel attachments. I tried the Adobe PDF  reader the instructions seemed to be for another type of tablet although it said it was for Kindle Fire. I down loaded the basic Documents to go which worked straight away on PDF. I tried it on an Excel doc and a note popped up to say I needed the full version. I took me to Amazon.com and it was priced in $'s.I bought it but couldn't down load it. After ringing the Kindle help I was pointed to the Amazon.co.uk App site and bought it for £9.55. and they arranged the credit from Amazon.com.<br />It worked straight away as for as opening docs was concerned, I haven't tried creating anything but it certainly has the capability.<br />I gave it 4 stars because it took me to the wrong place
B000TEMROY|5.0|This song is my favorite by the Verve.  It is best when I am feeling like my life is going well and I should be thankful for how far I have come.  It's a wonderfully done song that makes me sit back and feel good inside.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|These are great DVD sets with extra's and special features. A great set for all Big Bang Theory fans!!! Bazinga!!!!!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Dub step and violin...  Two unusual items that go great together here.  I loved her \\"Game of Thrones\\" theme, and this is even better.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bougth it being in okay shape thinking the introductory was for people who never work out and would be easy.  I was wrong.  I probably could of stuck to the introductory, level 1 for a while longer but finally went to workout 2 just for a change and man, its kicking my butt!  I felt sore right after and I usually run or do weights a few times a week too.  Very impressed so far.
034580404X|4.0|There was a minor problemwith the co. i bought from, and a negetive on there record.  However they went out of there way to correct the problem (books4?cant remember name)negative needs to be erased. again this is the only way i seem to be able to do it.  You need to open this area for the customer!!!  Bought for female friend so cant rate content.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Incredible - Just excellent writing, acting, brings to life another time, place and culture. Watching it on my own timetable is wonderful.
0345529057|5.0|A lot of my friends raved about the show and since I don't have HBO I decided to read the books. This was a great deal and the books arrived promptly. They are really well written and I couldn't put them down!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I laughed out loud and enjoyed this book immensely!, I like her as an actress but didn't think it would be as engaging and funny as it was. It was just like her comedy- authentic voice.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I agree with some others who said the time limit interruptions were annoying. I enjoy mystery games for the relaxing search aspect. the last thing I need or want is to be cut off and have to start over. the graphics in this game are first rate and I had no complaints with its function on my two year old kindle fire. I'm uninstalling because of the timing issue. others may find that stimulating.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, We like so mutch Michael Jackson, is a great miss.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|This is a must see movie, so if you like Dicaprio you'll love this movie. I give it four stars...
B000VECADA|5.0|Wow, amazing figurines with it,,even is not a good enough movies but the box set was so serious too made...thanks
B000HF0KXU|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again because it has great actors and a good story line. Halle Barry is Johns helper and also she's in a nude scene,  John Travolta plays a villain a really Bad Ass Dude.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Rarely have I read such a dynamic opening. It places you alongside an escape route, as the breathless protagonist, in the grip of his &#34;Outview&#34;--his nightmarish vision--runs away from a danger yet unknown to us: &#34;I kept running. Nine of us had sworn our lives to protect the precious artifact sewn inside my belt. Six were already dead...&#34; And from this paragraph to the next, we take a sharp fall--a transition--from an era of sword battles down to the depth of a sacred Mayan pool where Nate wakes up to the present.<br /><br />Kyle and Linh, his friends, provide support, normalcy, and a sharp contrast to the protagonist's own family life. Since the day his dad died, Nate finds himself lost in an ever-growing chasm between him and his mom, and the mysterious placement of his older brother Dustin in a mental institution. No wonder Nate's sleep is tortured. The spiral mist of the Outview takes him to a place about which he knows only one thing: he does not want to go there. In the death-like state of dreaming, he experiences a horrible, painful death in a new permeation each time.<br /><br />The tension between the place he visits in his sleep and the place of his waking hours give the story its lights and shadows--but it also presents two different writing styles: the compelling, dynamic descriptions on one hand and the dialogue, trying to make sense of it all, on the other. I cannot say how other readers may react to this difference. For me, I found myself growing increasingly curious about the circumstances of his father's death, and of the lockup of his brother Dustin. Will Nate and his friends find a portal to another place, a secret world where they can hide from danger? Would their adventure continue to unravel there, and challenge them to find their inner courage?<br /><br />Like his protagonist, the author has lost his father under tragic circumstances. From that trying time in his life, Brandt Legg became driven to find success, even as he swerved precariously on his way there. The sentences he puts on the lips of his characters are quite telling, in the context of his own experience: &#34;Possessions, of any kind, block us from reaching the power of our soul,&#34; and, &#34;I think everything's connected.&#34; The author must have recalled the crippling migraine headaches from which he suffered, and used them here as a model for Nate's Outviews. This, to me, is a delightful way to pivot from reality, and elevate its pain into a creative space. Call it what it is: inspiration.<br /><br />Five stars.<br /><br />This book was sent to me gratis for an unbiased review.e.

B004VMUS9G|3.0|Good thing I wake up at the sound of a pin drop. So quiet If something else is on in the house you can't hear it.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|Purchased the movie for my grandchildren but enjoyed watching it again after many years as much as they enjoyed watching it for the first time.
B007ZLKK9I|3.0|George had always been my favorite Beatle because he reminded me of my father so I was excited to watch this documentary.  I was quickly disappointed when I realized it was simply a bunch of interviews and old film clips.  There was no narration to carry the film so it was essentially a grab bag of items.  The first hour was a waste as it didn't reveal anything new about the Beatle era.  His life after the Beatles was what I really wanted to see and although there were a few bits and pieces that were worth seeing (the interviews with Tom Petty and Patti Harrison were by far the best) it was really not worth the cost of admission.
