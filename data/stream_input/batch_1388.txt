B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All three books were amazing,especially the first one. They had me gripped from the start. The end of every chapter had you wanting to read more. Suzanne Collins always threw in a line at the end that would have you shocked and excited and dying to find out what happens next. Not many authors can engage there readers that much. 5 starts. Cannot wait for the movie to come out. Only 8 days. May the odds be ever in your favour!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked up this series because several fellow kindle readers had recommended it and the first book was free.  The only other dystopian fiction I've read is The Hunger Games trilogy (which was excellent, especially the first book) and Divergent (which was just okay in my opinion).  This series was excellent.  Engaging characters, lots of plot twists, and some really great writing.  And you might as well purchase the omnibus edition instead of each book individually because once you finish one you're going to immediately want to one-click the next one.  I don't know how anyone could start this series and not finish it.  I just completed Wool 5 this evening and I'm already anxiously awaiting Wool 6.  Well done, Mr. Howey!
006197806X|5.0|This second installment in the Delirium series is easily defies the \\"second book lull\\" that usually occur within a series or trilogy. I was absolutely dreading...waiting for that to happen, but I was Pandemonium is fast-paced, full of heart-ache, the deliria, and absolutely packed with action. The beginning of the book threw me off because the settings and times switch back and forth between the Wilds and society, \\"now\\" and \\"then\\". I got into the swing of things a few chapters in, but it was a bit disorienting at first.<br /><br />Ready for something shocking? A NEW [read: swoon-worthy] MAIN CHARACTER. That's right...and he's pretty wonderful, no doubt. [I'm attempting to leave out spoilers so as not to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it yet!] Let's just say that I was VERY happy with this book...the emotional ups and downs, Lena's transformation from one of the \\"zombies\\", she really came into her own in this book. I was ecstatic to see her express her own opinions and fight like crazy to make a difference in a world so oppressed, manipulative, and disfigured by hypocrisy.<br /><br />I am so excited for the next book Requiem that doesn't come out until NEXT February. I think I will have plenty of time to re-read both books before then!! If you have read both, PLEASE leave comments telling us what you thought and if you've only read Delirium, tell us what you're looking forward to in the second book or what you loved about the first. We love to get feedback from y'all and want to share our excitement and love for this series, the characters, and most of all, the author, Lauren Oliver!<br /><br />*Fair warning: This book will leave you emotionally drained and filled with even MORE questions than Delirium did! It's entirely possible that you will be left sitting, staring, asking \\"WHY?\\", screaming \\"No, no, no!\\", sobbing quietly/hysterically, and perhaps cursing how far away the next book release is.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I found this film very entertaining, enlightening but most of all endearing.  There isn't one actor who's performance doesn't add to the whole of this film, they all put on stellar performances without a hint of overstatement or artifice.<br /><br />The story of course is of a young english aristocrat who's love of cinema has him seek out a job in film.  Through his family connections he finally gets hired as 3rd assistant director in the film 'The Prince and the Showgirl' starring Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe.  The story thereafter is of a brief non-sexual encounter with Monroe and all that happened in the making of the film. Kenneth Branagh is superb channeling Sir Laurence Olivier, in a performance that had me laughing half the time and mesmerized about the small aspects of Olivier's style he managed to hone without it coming across as camp. Marilyn famously clashes with Olivier, who as director, has to put up with her tardiness, forgetting lines and general fragile yet diva behaviour.<br /><br />Now for Michelle Williams.  In the beginning of the film they show an excerpt of Williams performing Heat Wave from the film 'There's No Business Like Show business\\"  and I immediately had mixed feelings and almost thought she was miscast;  it was her body.  You see Williams diminutive child-like frame barely holding up a dress meant for a curvier woman. They pad her hips which contrasts two twigs meant to be legs, small arms and breasts, old hollywood make-up that left Williams looking old and washed out and not a hint of sexiness...I was aghast and thought \\"This is wrong, ALL WRONG!!!\\". They make up for this by later concentrating mostly on Williams face who is more than talented enough to exude the vulnerability, freshness, seductive sweetness and almost too open unguarded expressions we come to recognize as distinctly Monroe charm, also they leave off the heavy make-up.  This is a role where the physicality is important, we don't just remember Marilyn's face but the natural contours of her body, so to have an actress with the wrong body distracts the same way a too skinny woman playing Sophia Loren would have you questioning the authenticity of the role. The camera however compensates and concentrates on what Williams gets right which is the mood and cheekiness of Marilyn, the vanilla ice cream sexiness and little girl lost.  Its a distilled Marilyn that left me thinking \\"Nicely Done!\\".  Williams brings a dignity, humanity and authentic classy sweetness to the role. I'm sure Marilyn would have been proud.<br /><br />There is no question that the portrayal of what went on at the shooting of The Prince and the Showgirl is accurate.  If you have read enough biographies on Marilyn at that time everything in this film just fits including the nature of he behaviour which today is attributed to Borderline Personality Disorder.  They show MM as manipulative but in the way toddlers are, grabbing hold demanding time, attention and affection when they need you and then forgetting you minutes later only to return and drain you a bit more, the difference is we don't take it personally when it comes from a toddler.  Marilyn was very emotionally demanding and consequently seduced a lot of minders and helpers and people who thought only they could protect her, understand her, help her when in the end they were simply dangling from her strings. It is said that during the filming 'The Misfits' Marilyn broke Arthur Miller who was doing everything and anything to make her happy; at the end of shooting she had arranged a ride from location with other people and got in a car which drove away leaving Miller deserted, abandoned, alone and without a ride on a deserted set.  It was as if he were merely an old shoe she had forgotten to pack.  Consequently they divorced but he like Di Maggio loved her dearly and both went to their grave never writing or speaking of Marilyn out of complete respect for her.  If only Princess Diana could have said thesame.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I got the audiobook from Audible.com and it was hard to turn it off.  It combines hilarious geek and references and culture with 80s pop culture trivia and then blends in the suspense and gripping storytelling of the best cyberpunks.  Also, who better to narrate the tale of a snarky gamer than THE snarky gamer, @wilw.  Love it!!!!<br /><br />If you like this, you may also like Lost at the Con by Bryan Young, Android's Dream by John Scalzi or Nueromancer by Gibson; and visa versa.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|A very unhappy someone who was ticked off they spent money on this series after falling for the hype let me read this on their Kindle and all I can say is I am glad I didn't dish out $10 a piece for all of the \\"Holy cow\\", \\"Holy s---\\", \\"Holy ---k\\", \\"my wife\\", \\"Mrs. Grey\\", smirks, mutters, blush,\\"Oh my\\" \\"mine\\" Need I go on because those are just a few? All this author needed to do if she has a limited knowledge of vocabulary is pick up a dictionary. One five star reviewer called it the best book of 2012. Earth to reviewer - 2012 just started! We still have over 8 months to go! Another said Ana was the strongest heroine ever. What? Let's see it took her 3 days from their break-up at the end of book 1 to get back with Christian because she needed a ride to the gallery since she'd promise Jose she'd show up, or was it more like she missed Christian because he was so hot? She's so strong that she stopped eating and oops in those very few days since she left him she lost an incredible and noticeable amount of weight? Really, I didn't know the pounds fell off so quickly. She's so strong that everytime she answers back she immediately follow-up by submitting to whatever he wants. Another fan wants a movie made. Yeah, an all-sex movie would go down really well! What was the storyline here but how to have sex in handcuffs, tied up, he shaves her and she shaves him, then have more sex? Then of course, the few moments when they aren't having sex, they smirk, mutters, laters babe, oh my, she blushes, she bites her lip, and then there's her inner goddess constantly speaking. What a fascinating movie that would make! As for the Twilight saga which some of you say this remind you of, at least young Bella's vocab seemed much more sophisticated and grown-up considering HER AGE versus those of Christian and Ana's who are older by several years. Bella was insecure, yes, but thank goodness you didn't have to deal with her inner goddess, her oh my, and all of the other constantly repetitive words that these books have. Yes, you can have A LOT of sex, but still have intelligent, adult conversation! He's supposedly a billionaire CEO yet all he can do is repeat the same phrases over and over again just as Ana does. All I can say is Holy ---t, Holy cow, Holy ---k, am I glad I didn't drink the Kool-Aid!

B00008OLIO|2.0|Well I am sorry to say that this CD was scratched even after I cleaned it thinking I had removed the scratches and it was no longer going to skip. I don't want to write a bad review, but when you buy a used CD, it should not be scratched and the seller should have checked it out first and at least said it was scratched. And it was not just one song, three songs could not be played because it was so scratched. I will not return it because I paid $8 and the refund would be $6 without calculating shipping and the hassel. So all in all I got a used CD that I can listen to most of the songs as long as I upload the CD to itunes and delete the bad songs.
B003B02PFO|4.0|I really enjoyed this departure for John Grisham (his books are usually court related).  I found it enjoyable and very easy to read while my wife was shopping.

1451627289|5.0|I loved this book!!!  I haven't read such a satisfying book that kept you hooked in such a long time and one from Stephen King is a bonus.  I read it on Kindle and had no idea how long it was but the reading flew.<br /><br />I'm not telling about the story because so many before me who reviewed did that, but don't pass it by because you think it's all history, it's not, but it has history woven in.  It's a time travel story.  A love story.  A story about a good man who wants to do the right thing but isn't sure he can.  You won't guess the ending as another reviewer commented, it's not obvious but it's as good as that first taste of creamy peanut butter from a freshly opened jar.<br /><br />If you're a fan of King as I am or of time travel, just read it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider is a fun way to kill time. it makes me feel smarter, too. I would recommend this game to people who like puzzles.

B00555X8OA|4.0|So far, the book is informative and fairly well written, though occasionally I have had to re-read portions to be sure I understood what was being explained. Usually this was text about an experiment, how it was conducted and the results, to support the idea the author is sharing.  I am one of those people who often doesn't get through a good book, because of the effort it requires in relation to the return.  I have intentions of finishing eventually, but have set the book aside for another that just seems to flow because of its direct writing as well as my interest.  That said, the book may flow for you, the information will improve your thinking, and if you are keenly interested in this subject area, you will no doubt finish it. The book is worth buying even if you never finish it, which is the reason I gave it only 4 stars.
B0002DRBX4|5.0|This is simply one of the funniest movies ever made. I've watched it hundreds of times, and my wife finally bought it on DVD a couple weeks ago. She had to immediately loan it to a friend from her office. I recommend it to nearly everyone I meet.<br /><br />The plot, writing, and casting in this movie were brilliant. It is filled with so many funny lines and quotes that it would be impossible to list them without giving you the entire script. This movie captures the irony of a modern day office environment perfectly. I think all managers out there should watch it.<br /><br />It's a great movie!
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Game is fun and it is done well.  It lets you keep trying until you get the solution which is handy.  Some of the levels seem impossible, but they can all be solved, maybe with a bit of luck though.  Overall a fun game; there are 100 levels, but even so we finished them all too quickly.  It isn't as much of a challenge the second time through.

1451627289|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan for a long time (25-30 years), despite the knowledge that many of his works have major flaws.  This is now my favorite of his stories I've read.  Compelling, wonderful characters, and as always his details bring everything to life.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll just admit it: I love TV. I prefer it to a book any day of the week. But from the time I started Wool until I finished it, I didn't even turn my television on. The story was so compelling, the characters so real, that all I wanted to do from the minute I woke up (after a too-late night) was to keep reading it. Loved it so much that I'm about to buy the paperback to pass around to my Kindle-less friends and family.<br /><br />Note that if you download the sample you can actually read the first Wool and the beginning of Wool 2 for free. Just be warned that if you do, you'll buy the Omnibus as soon as you finish anyway.<br /><br />I could go on, but no review I could ever write would do justice to Wool and the incredible world that Hugh Howey has created for us. Thanks, Mr. Howey, and I can't wait for more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|yeah yeah yeah eyahd djdjdjd djjdkskk its pretty cool I like how it syncs but lists would be a good edition but there's no ads so that's good
B005LAIH2W|5.0|More and more I believe modern audiences are going to the movies expecting to be disappointed.  This is partly owing to pre-release media bombardments featuring a given film's highlights and then after we're lured into the theater we discover that those scenes were no more than window-dressing for sound and fury.  Yes, John Carter has those big, action scenes but they are absolutely essential for \\"bringing to life\\" what was originally an adventure, sci-fi/fantasy book series.<br /><br />There will, no doubt, be many reviewers that want to contrast this film with past monolithic sci-fi/fantasy adventures but let us not forget that long, long before Star Wars or Avatar there was John Carter of Mars; a fantasy series created by Edgar Rice Burroughs around the same time period as WWI and which remains to this day, one of the most imaginative mythologies in fantasy and sci-fi literature of all time.  When they were written, Burroughs' novels were considered more pulp fiction or fantasy entertainment for perhaps a less mature audience than serious fiction; however I believe that the film adaptation has definitely added levels of maturity and character complexity that were never fully developed in the books.  For example the principal character John Carter, although a natural fighter, is haunted by his tragic past as a Civil War veteran which causes him to resist an inherent, heroic inclination and compels him to simply drop out of society or at least obtain the option to distance himself from it (e.g. his gold prospecting).  Add to this the fact that he's suddenly hurled into an alien world complete with \\"civil wars\\" and racial tensions of its own where he is literally confronted with an option to embrace a separate \\"destiny\\" within the context of a new life.  The movie adaptation does not however force Carter to face these struggles alone because the role of Dejah Thoris has been transformed from a pretty piece of furniture, doomed to be continually taken captive as she was in the books, to an incredibly intelligent, as well as beautiful warrior princess  that proves herself to be every bit a heroine of Mars.  Ever since Dragonheart we have seen completely CGI animated characters in major roles, with Gollum in LOTR taking this potential to new levels and more recently the character of Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes.  This is also the case with another leading character in this film, i.e. Sola a female member of the Thark race (the distinctive Green Martians), as a sympathetic and courageous supporting role.<br /><br />I always loved the creativity of Burroughs in his books but I equally admire what the writers and producers have done with the film John Carter.  Much of the cinematography looks reminiscent of the wonderful book covers that Michael Whelan did back in the 90's (lol, one of the reasons they originally appealed to me).  And of course, modern innovations in CGI have made it possible for such a fantastic universe as this to be transformed into a live-action feature film.  As with LOTR, the special effects supplement a great story rather than supplant a shallow story that only serves as a vehicle for cleverly-arranged, silver-screen pixels (e.g. transformers or the re-booted Star Trek).<br /><br />John Carter does not appear to be a \\"feel good\\" movie (although the kids in the theater seemed to like it) or sci-fi for the masses like Avatar; rather it seems to me that Disney might be targeting true sci-fi/fantasy lovers rather than producing typically forgettable crowd pleasers.  Is it possible that Disney is actually bucking the Hollywood trend?<br /><br />if I could give this one 10 stars I would because it's just so exceptional given the climate of modern movies.  It's truly a visually stunning movie with a multitude of memorable scenes, an excellent musical score and it honestly reminded me of the experience of seeing the original Star Wars in the theater as a kid.was in the books, to an incredibly intelligent, as well as beautiful warrior princess  that proves herself to be every bit a heroine of Mars.

B004XISI4A|3.0|I don't really want the series to end, as other reviewers have demanded, because I don't want to say goodbye to my \\"friends\\" in Westeros. I'll still buy whatever the venerable GRRM manages to dish up. But that said, this book is like an ageing river - it's getting wider and shallower and slower. New characters and tribes are being added while I want to know what's happening with my old favourites. At this rate, there'll be only one chapter on each of the characters in the next book, and zero plot progression. And I don't really care about the islanders and other new tribes. I found myself skipping their chapters to read about Arya, Jon Snow, etc.<br />So, in summary, GRRM can drag out the series as long as he wants, as long as the plot keeps moving forward, and that is not happening in this book.

The night light is just enough to be soothing and for mommy to see a bit in the dark, without distracting or waking up the baby if he's falling asleep. I never used the remote, but could see how that could be a plus, too! He turns on his songs now all by himself. It's so cute!

B004XDYJRU|3.0|I like everything about tunein except the fact that their radio guide is often inaccurate, particularly where non-profit and public radio stations are concerned. I've submitted numerous corrections, all of which tunein ignored. When I complained, they wrote back and told me that they don't maintain the public radio listings (how would anyone know this?) and directed me to publicradiofan.com, which is apparently maintained by one unpaid person in his spare time, who likewise did not respond to my request for to update the listings nor publish the correction. So, if you like independent non-profit radio, expect some frustration with tunein's outdated listings.

It turns out that it is extremely simple to play, and this video review actually helped with that: [...]    My girlfriend and I play this one a bunch now.  It has a way of letting you interact with the other player, without adversely impacting them too much, such as when we play Gloom, where the point is to actually hamper the other person.

Not perfect, but at least the disc loads. I added a USB stick to the back of the OPPO and it did the magic. Seems the internal persistant memory of the OPPO is not enough to load the menues of Games of Thrones. However, I think that HBO did a very bad work here with these Bluray discs. The time it takes to load, the flaws in the menues, the freezings it produces in the player, makes me believe that the programmers who coded the Java portions of the BD were either drunk or trying to reinvent the wheel getting out of codings standards completely. HBO should test a little bit best their products before putting them in the market... I am downgrading the rate to 2 stars due to this HBO lack of professionalism.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Buying the Quadrilogy to see everything in order, and as shown, is the only way to really appreciate this series. It may be a little \\"overkill\\" for some, but for the Videophile it is exceptional.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read! I couldn't put it down. Very well written with easy flow. The most erotic, mysterious, and action packed book I've read.  I think every woman will have a crush on Christian Grey! HOPEFUllY, we'll get to see Ana and Christian again in the near future!
1612130283|5.0|First let me say romanace novels really aren't my thing. I absolutly loved these books! I got them a week ago and have read them twice! The story is so good without the sex. Add the sex in and wow! Christian's story is so sad, but you find out why he is the way he is and it makes you love him so much more. Ana is a stong young woman. She \\"tames\\" Christian. Amazing! Very Good Read
0061969656|5.0|Review first posted on Amazon.co.uk on 6 October 2011<br /><br />I read this one in less than 36 hours, between Tuesday evening and Wednesday early morning, and just HAD to finish it as quickly as possible. The title I've given to my review sums it up, more or less. This would be true regardless of whether you love Uthred's personality and adventures or whether you are starting to get fed up with him and his story, as a few commentators seem to be. I happen to be part of the former bunch of people. I am still just as interested in the character, the story he tells and the events he lives through as I was when I read the very first book on Uthred, some years ago. I also find that each installment of Uthred's adventures is top quality (and a real treat and pleasure to read).<br /><br />This is because of the author's talent. To me, this is historical fiction at its best, and it has consistently been so from the very beginning.<br /><br />First, the period and events have, as usual with Cornwell, been well researched. Fortunately, some of his competitors can do as well as that, although there may only be a few of them.<br /><br />Second, and much rarer in my view, is the author's modesty and honesty. Unlike a number of others, you never get the impression that Cornwell is attempting to show off his knowledge, either in the story itself or in his historical note or annexes (map, list of place names in Saxon with their modern day equivalent). Even better, he never hesitates to mention in his historical note where he has introduced fiction or fabrication in the story. Very few do this, either because they do not want to be seen as having taking liberties with the historical \\"facts\\" (but aren't these are works of fiction after all?) or because they cannot be bothered and may believe that most of their readers will not notice it or not care about it. Another strong point is that you can in effect read this book (and any others in the series) separately, which is not that frequent and the author is talented and takes enough trouble to insert sufficient information in each installment to make it self-standing without feeling the need to summarize the previous books over some dozens of pages, as some authors sometimes do in a rather boring way. So, thank you Bernard for showing so much consideration for all of your readers, as opposed to just marketing a product...<br /><br />Third, well, I like Uthred as a character. I find him both credible (including his \\"kill-first-ask-questions-after\\" attitudes) and original. He both despises and defies the Church, its clerics, monks and bishops openly. This theme could already be found, in a much milder version, with Lord Derfel in Cornwell's trilogy on King Arthur. He, it is amplified but nevertheless credible in my view. After all, Uthred is a warlord brought up and trained by the Danes, and a pagan to boot. He would have little time and even less patience for the \\"nailed Tyrant\\", his mostly hypocritical self-serving servants and his philosophy of \\"brotherly love\\" so \\"unreal\\" to him. Uthred's mixture of boasting, blustering, bravery and cunning is also an interesting twist. This is not only about showing off. It is, as he alludes to in the book, about creating a reputation, living up to it, and showing that he is fearless (although he is afraid, of course). There are numerous other features that make him somewhat sympathetic, including his sense of loyalty to Alfred and his children.<br /><br />Fourth, of course, there are the fights and battle scenes, all described in much graphic and gory detail. This is one of the things that Cornwell does best. We have become accustomed to this, and it has been picked up and imitated with various degrees of success by many other authors writing on the same or on other periods (Greeks, Romans, Normans etc...). Nowadays, it sometimes feels like almost a \\"must\\". You get the impression that every author writting historical fiction gets told that having a couple of gore scenes is part of the ingredients of a \\"marketable\\" historical novel. The difference with Cornwell (and with a very few other authors, such as the late and much lamented Pressfield) is that all this blood and gore makes the story \\"sound and feel\\" REAL, as opposed to being a marketing ploy. You just have to close your eyes to imagine the shield walls crashing against each other.<br /><br />Very few, in my view, have managed to bring both their characters and their period to life as well as Bernard Cornwell.<br /><br />Waiting for the next installment will seem like a very, very long time...f gore scenes is part of the ingredients of a \\"marketable\\" historical novel.

B007JRU2UK|4.0|great story line..great settings (hawaiian islands). the actors in this flic are awesome. i was most interested in this movie because of the story line. if you know how it feels to lose a loved one well you will be touch..and for those who experienced one's decisions as well. not an action nor fiction..but plain realistic in any setting.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a huge fan of the HBO show so I decided to start reading the books as I wait for Season 2 to start. This is a good long book. It is well written and like most things, is better than seeing it adapted into TV/Film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|so nice that an artist can create a work that is affordable.  i love my kindle because of authors like howey
B003UMW68Y|4.0|I love this movie, it's good for both Halloween & Christmas time, plus good for family time together.. the new HD is great as well!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|First off, these books are amazing! I loved all of them. I just got a kindle and this was my first big purchase. It made it a lot easier that I could buy all of these books at once. It was a good price too! It was very convenient to buy all the books together because once you finished one, you could move right on to the next one, without pause. GREAT PURCHASE! If there are any series that you can buy in a bundle I highly suggest doing so!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really loved reading these books. After hearing about them sevral times I decided I would see what all the fuss was about. I had a hard time putting them down! This wasn't the most cheerful story but that doesn't matter to me. This was an interesting read and it kept me completely interested through every step of the way, that's what makes a good book to me. Too many times I have started a book and not wanted to finish it because I got board with it. I had no problems keeping interested with these. If you like happy endings then this might not be the best choice for you. Can't wait for the movie!
0525478817|5.0|All right, I admit it, I got suckered into this. I'm a sucker for autographed copies and it had a fine quote by Judi Picoult on the cover and Wal-Mart was selling it at a deep discount. So what if I never heard of the guy? Then I get home and find out is is \\"young adult\\" lit which I never read, not even Harry Potter, and worse it is about young adults dying of cancer, which topic I avoid since it depresses the hell out of me. (Then I find out he signed a bazillion of them and I was tripping over signed copies at every book store I went into. I got the only one at that Wal-Mart and thought I had something special.) Well, I decided to give it my 50 page test - any book is entitled to that, and got hooked.<br /><br />The writing is masterful and the story and characters interesting. Yes, it has some moments that rip your heart out and bring tears to your eyes but it has some great humor and high points. The pure humanity of it just put me away.<br /><br />So, John, thanks for a great read. I don't know if our paths will cross again but it was a fine experience to have them cross this once.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never posted a review before and was intending to just leave a few choice words, however, it says I must leave at least 20 words! (kinda controlling like Christian, huh!)  Anyway, I think the people who left anything less than 5 stars is crazy, boring and dull!  This is a fabulous trilogy!  I love it Mrs. James!  Keep'em coming!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have tried other office suites available for Android phones and this one is by far the best one available!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I  wouldn't normally read a book such as this but I saw it on one of the best seller lists and thought I'd give it a read. James tells a story that will make you smile, make your heart ache, and keep your reading until the last page of the third book. Yes there is some pretty kinky sex but nothing that isn't already out there. I think most readers could handle it. Give it a try!
B004EPYZT4|4.0|I liked the movie overall. Not the greatest acting I've ever seen, but I enjoyed the action and the Conan franchise is pretty versatile as well as subject to interpretation.

B005HSG3U6|1.0|The good news is the Marware/Amazon Folio Cover is cheap. The bad news is the Marware/Amazon Folio Cover is cheap. \\"Cheap\\" as in cheaply made - cheesy plastic and who-knows-what for the cover. At least it has a nifty elastic band. \\"Cheap\\" as in cheaply designed - it's supposed to act as a stand for your Kindle Fire but it collapses constantly. \\"Cheap\\" as in \\"cheep\\" - this one's for the birds.

B0001ADAVK|3.0|This movie has higher ambitions than it achieves but is still provides enough interest to justify the pop-corn and cuddling on the couch.<br /><br />Julia Roberts' performance only rises above the level of general competence once in the movie, when, at the beginning as she conducts her first class in art history, she is savaged by her students in their arrogant display of prior knowledge of her material.  Roberts conveys the horror that a new teacher on the block would feel in such a circumstance to absolute perfection.  During the rest of the movie it was intended that she embody the intriguing mystery of the Mona Lisa, hiding depths of tantalizing interest behind the mystery of her smile.  Always the painting evokes a sense of benevolent superiority as one wonders what secret knowledge constitutes her tranquility.  Roberts achieves the distance, the \\"arms-length\\"  in relationships between her and her male and female admirers but never the sense of hidden depths that would have carried her performance over the top.  The ending is predictable but inevitable.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also adequate to their roles though it is hard to accept several of the characters as being only 20-21 years old... they needed younger actresses.  The male roles in this story are all inherently flawed and the characters one by one prove themselves unworthy of \\"possessing\\" the Mona Lisa or even deserving her respect, much less admiration.  If this is a commentary on the general state of male-female relations then the stereotypes are pretty heavy handed.<br /><br />All that being said, Julia Roberts is always worth watching and the photography and the setting are enough to evoke winsome nostalgia for days when spending time in the crucible of Ivy League higher education gave opportunity for dreaming big dreams, talking all night about issues and radically defending opinions which one could only maintain in splendid isolation from the harsh reality of the rest of life.<br /><br />Grab some popcorn and enjoy the \\"chick flick.\\">Grab some popcorn and enjoy the \\"chick flick.\\"
B0076NKLRQ|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I was skeptical about Michelle Williams acting as Marilyn Monroe after having watched the movie I was blown away! Michelle Williams was absolutely amazing! She put so much into this role. The movie as a whole is just as amazing! I recommended this movie to my family and friends. I could watch it over and over.
1607512297|4.0|The inaugural novel \\"The Blade Itself:  The First Law - Book One\\" has Bayaz, First of the Magi, linking several characters in an intriguing plotline of fantastic action with brutal battles and awesome magic, sneaky political maneuvering, and growing romance.  Initially all separated by land and politics, a group gathers (some unwillingly) by the will of Bayaz to confront a growing threat.<br /><br />Logen, the Bloody-Nine, has the most appeal as the notorious yet reluctant fighter.  The arrogant Captain Jezal dan Luthar, nobleman and easily dislikable, has got to be as critical as anyone else but only annoys people at this stage.  The tragic figure Inquisitor Sand dan Glokta stumbles through his career as a feared and successful interrogator, a person of great interest.  Ferro Maljinn captures only a couple chapters but can potentially be the key to the overall success of the group.<br /><br />A detailed map of the significant terrains and a comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend the series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved it.  I will have to look into more Steven King novels.  I stopped reading him because he was getting into too many Gouls,etc.  This book was very touching in parts and pegged the 1960's well.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|I had expected more from P. D. James.  So she's not Jane Austin, but she purports to carry on from the end of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" and I think her effort falls flat.  There is really no intrigue, no moments of furtive glances and sisterly talks full of angst.  It's as though the characters we loved in \\"P & P\\" had all matured into dull homebodies, able to endure whatever happens on their estate as a matter of course.  James unconvincingly tries to ruffle feathers and create  drama in the court system. Alas. We are tempted, but ultimately let down.  Most of all, her characters don't resemble the full-bodied ones we grew to love in Jane Austin's work.  It's a shame we have to compare James to Austin, but she invited it. Unfortunately.

B002ZG981E|3.0|I've always heard good things about this movie, and finally decided to give in. When I first started watching, it was boring and hard to follow, but is started to get better. You have to really be paying attention and use your brain to understand the plot. A thief named Cobb enters people's dreams and steals information. His newest client named Mr. Saito asks him to perform 'Inception' (planting an idea within the person's mind without them knowing) on a businessman named Fisher. You might like INCEPTION!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am completely addicted to these books! I cannot put them down! I certainly do not want the story to end. And am really sad that I am almost done with the trilogy. I recommend this to everyone!

B005D0RDIE|1.0|My boyfriend is a long time Rush fan that has seen the band in concert 9 times since the early 1980's. I bought this DVD off of amazon.com for his birthday to surprise him. He received the order in just a few days, but when he put the DVD in the player, the only audio on the disc was the intros and the \\"special features.\\" When he played the concert footage, the was absolutely no audio what so ever. He jumped through the various songs to see if it was just on one portion of the disc...but that was to no avail. Absolutely no audio at all. We tried two different DVD players in two different homes...and nothing. I sent amazon.com two different emails to get this problem resolved and get the DVD exchanged, but so far they have yet to contact me back. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in amazon.com. Instead of exchanging DVD's, I think that I will just take a refund and purchase the DVD from a local business. AMAZON.COM......CONTACT ME IMMEDIATLY!!! I only rated this item a single star because it would not let me leave zero stars.....and the zero stars is for amazon.com's lack of follow up. Susan Kehoe
B005LAIH2W|3.0|To me, this movie was okay to watch once. It had some funny moments, decent sci-fi action and an interesting storyline, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. A Civil War vet named John Cater is transported from our world to Mars by a strange medallion. He reluctantly agrees to help fight in the war to save the planet. If you like sci-fi epics, you might enjoy JOHN CARTER!!!

I went back and started over and it let.me pick color ...but would not let me pick Icon. So I went back and started over. Then it didn't let me choose the color...again. Wasted 99cents and 10 minutes of time with extra downloading and backtracking through setup! Its supposed to be kindlefire edition...I don't think so!
0670022950|5.0|Those who think the end of the world is just around the corner will see \\"proof\\" in just about everything, and may be immune to the logical arguments. Yet, one of their \\"proofs\\" that may be remotely plausible to many people is that: \\"The increased violence in the world, is a proof that the end of the world is coming\\".<br /><br />As this book demonstrates they couldn't be more wrong about this ! If the increase of violence & human depravity, is a tell-tale sign of the approaching Apocalypse, then it should have happened centuries ago, when both violence & human depravity was at their peak !<br /><br />Unfortunately, when facts don't fit the zealots' convictions, there is something wrong about those facts. And some anecdotal news report of some kind of brutal murder somewhere in the country is enough for them to negate any scientific conclusion that say otherwise.<br /><br />Fortunately, even those who are not scientifically fluent, but are at least somewhat open-minded, would be easily convinced that violence is on decrease by this accessible yet rigorous book.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|The only Lorax story I knew was the 70's cartoon classic. This new movie seemed much different, but still good. It didn't have enough Lorax in it. When a boy named Ted tries to find a tree for a girl named Audrey, he meets the Once-ler and tells him the story about why there are no more trees. Ted tries to bring the trees back before the Mayor of Thneed-Ville tries to stop him. I'd probably recommend THE LORAX!!!
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|This sequel brings back most characters that you liked in the first movie and<br />the story continues. Mumble 's kid as the first movie is different than others(must<br />run in the family) and this is not just his tale, but a story that brings in new<br />characters, fantastic animation, new songs and the beat goes on.<br />Most of the music is from the past, and not everybody might get into the grooves but<br />basically if you liked the first one which had that type of music, this one<br />continues the trend. Dont let the negative comments scare you...  and also this<br />might tick off those negative reviewers....yesss its a keeper.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I guess because its meant for little kids, I found the movie ok. I saw this because I had a free movie ticket and nothing else was good in the theater. I mean I enjoyed it but it felt like a Dr. Seuss movie. There were rhyme after rhyme after ryhmes. I mean some were so bad, they were a tad lame. Some were very odd, that a codd croaked (oh my god, now Im talking in rhyme). Now the movie did have funny moments and I loved the voice cast but I felt this wouldve been a good rental unless you have kids.<br /><br />One thing was that it had an obvious message of save the trees which was everywhere in the movie<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Funny moments<br />-Voice actors<br />-Good rental<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The rhymes<br />-The sillyness<br />-Obvious message

B0050SYS5A|5.0|A key issue with the XBox Kinect is that it needs a large space to operate properly. With the XBox Zoom add-on device, you can now play in far less space. How does it work - and DOES it work?<br /><br />First, let me explain what the device is. Photos make it seem like an entire Kinect system, but all it is is a clip-on that goes over the three lenses. So in the image you see, the Zoom part is ONLY the plastic raised clip area that is over the three lenses. In essence it's putting \\"glasses\\" on your Kinect system, so the lenses see more close up.<br /><br />This means that those Zoom lenses MUST BE PERFECTLY CLEAN. If there are any smudges, or fingerprints, or anything else on those lenses, it is going to greatly distort the image the Kinect sees and make the games not read your motions well.<br /><br />The Zoom comes with a think plastic protective shield - make sure you pop out the three circle areas that would go over the lenses. You want nothing at all between the Kinect's lenses and the Zoom's lenses and your body.<br /><br />When we first put the Zoom onto our Kinect, there was a \\"ghosting\\" effect around our body. Apparently we hadn't had it seated quite right. Once we removed it and re-seated it, the ghosting went away completely.<br /><br />I loaded a photo onto Amazon so you can see what the positioning difference is. You can see it by scrolling up, looking at the main image in the top left, and then clicking through the options for alternate images. Mine is the side by side avatar image. The image on the left is my \\"avatar\\" in a normal Kinect game. On the right is the exact same game, from the exact same location, but now with the Zoom installed. You can even see that I'm holding the camera up. So there's no ghosting or other issues, and the character is definitely much more centered within the available space.<br /><br />I tried a set of games without and then with the Zoom. I got the same scores in the game either way. So my performance wasn't negatively impacted by the Zoom addition. My moves on screen seemed as smooth in either situation.<br /><br />A key here is that the Zoom requires the optics to be perfectly clean and flawless. It could be that your Zoom unit has gotten dirty or smudged if it's not working. It could be that it's not aligned exactly perfectly with the Kinect's lenses. It could also be that you got a Zoom unit that had inherent flaws in its lenses.<br /><br />However, it seems if you get a good Zoom unit, and then take care of the lenses properly, that it can be a godsend for people like me who only have 8 feet of space to work with in the living room.<br /><br />We have our Kinect located beneath our TV.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10 for me.<br /><br />I purchased my Zoom with my own funds.impacted by the Zoom addition.

B0034G4P4O|3.0|Having never been exposed to the Tintin books or TV series, I approached this movie merely on its pedigree and the trailer.  Like many of Spielberg and Peter Jackson films, TINTIN is a big, action-oriented adventure, an animated Indiana Jones of sorts.<br />Motion performance animation is a strange experience, a cross between cartoons and real-life characters.  As expected, the production is flawless, the action scenes well-executed and the voice characterizations well chosen.  Unfortunately, the movie felt more like an assault of the senses, almost like there was too much going on and for too long.  I just expected a little more humor and less swashbuckling.  I'm sure audiences with knowledge of the source material found it more enjoyable.

B004I8WD6E|1.0|STOP RIGHT HERE and navigate away from this page. DO NOT buy this product if your intent is to PROTECT your phone. I had no issues putting it on or removing it. However, within a week of use this thing left 3 highly visible scuffs on the back of my phone, courtesy of the concentric circle design. One of these scuffs goes clear cross the back of the phone. This does the complete opposite of what it was meant to do. If you are dead set on buying this I highly recommend slapping on a back protector first, because this will scratch up your phone worse than if it had no protection at all.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|I heard two songs off this album this morning thanks to Pandora. I knew I had to have it. Rarely does an album strike me so much where I have to have it. I've now listened to the first three songs off this album. I'm glad I bought it. Can't wait to hear the rest of the album. If you're looking for music to inspire you with courage, this is it.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|The fifty shades trilogy has to be by far some of the best books ever!  I fell in love with the characters and was sad when it was over!

B0059XTUB8|4.0|Marilyn is perhaps more popular now then she ever was. Between movies, TV shows (Smash), and new books about her, she still one of the most talked about stars of the moment. My Week with Marilyn gives us a good take and some insight into her life.<br />Plot: The plot is intriguing from the start, a small time is to be spent with Marilyn while she is in London shooting a film with Sir Laurence Olivier. Colin, the 3rd on the film, becomes Marilyn's friend and confidant; they also embark on a small love affair. While I have trouble believing every conversation and scene from this film happened in real life (this film is based on a true story book), it was still portrayed well.<br />Characters: The characters are very engaging. Olivier is flawed but grand, as is Marilyn. Colin is a treat, and I look to see more from the actor who portrated him in the future.<br />Acting/Writing: The acting in this movie was very well done. Williams did well playing Marilyn. It wasn't a perfect performance, but it was pretty damn good.<br />Overall: I say watch this movie. It's very accessible, even though it was awards season fodder. It was an interesting and insightful 1 1/2 hours.
0062119044|4.0|WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN:<br />WOW - this book was nothing short of a \\"ripper.\\"  The subject matters were incredibly poignant and kept me in a state of fury and/or depression as I read it.  Beautifully written - which is how I got through what I thought to be an overlong first half, to get to the overwhelming 2nd half.  I know something of raising children having been a very participatory father of a very easy to raise daughter and much more difficult to raise son (though nothing remotely like Kevin).  I understand completely Eva's conflicted motherhood and do not blame her at all.  Kevin was an absolutely horrible person - evil, conniving, hateful beyond words, and \\"sharp as a tack\\" which made him all the more malevolent.  He lived in his own world.  I found Eva inconsistent.  A very smart business woman.  A woman who travelled to all parts of the world facing all manner of social differences and conundrums to be solved.  Ostensibly able to deal with people and to distill different social mores into a common acceptable behavior.  Yet she seemed utterly powerless in dealing with what was clearly a monstrous person.  How in God's name could she have ever trusted Kevin with Celia - the history of Kevin's behavior, for which Eva had the best exposure to between herself and her husband, Franklin.  Especially true after the dust up with the Drano.  To let that incident slide was unforgiveable on Eva's part, even to the point of separating from Franklin and being sure Celia was separated from Kevin.  Sending Kevin off to military school at the point would have been the minimum she should have demanded.  It is out of character for her to do what she did, which was nothing.  Further out of character for Eva was her buying into the rule of modern day child rearing of smothering them with fake love by burying them in whatever it is that the little brat wanted.  But certainly this was not Franklins problem as he was thoroughly into the way far too many Americans raise theirchildren - demanding nothing from the children and submitting utterly to every demand OF the children.  What a sniveling, wimp of a father and utterly spineless in always making Eva the scapegoat, diminishing her authority in nearly every instance, further hampering her in her role as a responsible mother.  This is a theme in the book that Lionel Shriver fails to address in her afterword of the book - but is equally important an issue as a mother who cannot love her child.  This book really was difficult to read because of the failures of the characters - but they are common failures too often found and seemingly little discussed.  Thought provoking just not does it justice.<br />My sense of Kevin is that he was born the way he was - that very little in the way of nurture would have changed him.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is very durable and is a great price. I wanted to buy the leather cover but this is just as good.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|I wanted so much to love this book, but I just never was fully drawn into it. While I loved Tom's spirit (especially his superstitious nature and all the details about his folk beliefs), the organization of the book was just too episodic for me. It didn't help that most of the plot was already very familiar to me just from exposure to pop culture over the years.<br /><br />I'm not giving up on reading more Twain -- I just think this particular book wasn't a good fit for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I didn't realize what type of book this was and as I was reading it it took me a while to get into.  Over time the characters grew on me and I started to grasp what I was reading.  In ways this book is typical with how it incorporates love but love is a part of life so why knock it for being part of a great story?  This is a story about a corrupt government using citizens as entertainment by showcasing their slaughter and manipulating the audiences perspective on events.  I won't elaborate too much as I don't want to spoil it but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be going to see the movie.  I am planning on reading the Trilogy overtime!    -Tactics  [...]  @therealtactics

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books. They grabbed my mind right from the beginning. It kept me guessing throughout the entire series as to who and where they would lead/end. The difference in character traits and how they were described as they crossed over to help /and or destroy one another was just great.
0553801473|1.0|It's obvious to this reviewer that content thought was seriously lacking for book 5, A Dance with Dragons.  Far too many loose ends even after the author attempted to close the series in a nice package.  Had I known about the serious issues with this book I wouldn't have started the long winded, boring series.  Very disappointed with Mr. Martin's effort in this one.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|Hi, this is a great game, but I think I will uninstall.  I'd prefer that the game not have the immodest start girls.  My 3 year old son loves playing the other version (that does not have the immodestly dressed women), but I was disappointed after downloading this game to see this.  I don't want to expose him to this.  Thanks.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is very addictive and fun. The graphics are great. I can play it for hours. I'm impressed with the games from G5.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great story with many emotions at play. Could be disturbing to those who do not have an open mind or are squeamish to the BDSM lifestyle. I thoroughly enjoyed it and give a lot of credit to E L James for accomplishing such an excellent work. I could not help but to laugh at some of the antics within. There are also points where one could not help but hold their breath to refrain from tears. This book came highly recommended to me and I also recommend it  to others.<br /><br />All of her characters are very well written and believable. No two are alike and each one adds a perfect touch to the whole effect the books give you.<br /><br />It starts off with Ana doing a favor for her friend and roomie Kate. Ana interviews Mr. Grey with a sense of unease and is unsure exactly why that is. But there is also a mutual attraction between the two that seems to overwhelm them both. Ana does not know what to do with this new and unusual feeling that Mr. Grey has brought on and is determined to ignore it. Mr. Grey  makes that extremely difficult!<br /><br />BDSM is a world in itself and Ana is introduced to it by Christian. She wants him with all that is her and though she's afraid of the unfamiliar lifestyle, she decides to give it and Christian a chance. Is she going to regret giving that chance? You will find out in a original, sexual and emotional story that has you sucked in from beginning to end.<br /><br />Also I have to mention. There are a few editorial errors within the book and some repetition, but they do not in anyway take from the impact or flow of the story. Hence still the 5 stars. I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to book two in the trilogy.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|I believe it's Trail, as in taking the dangerous trail? Or do they really mean trial, as in free trial sized bottle included?
0553582038|4.0|... then hold off on A Feast for Crows 'til you have time to go right into A Dance with Dragons. I started the series a few years ago, when it was only three  books; it took over my life for the duration. As I also love to listen to books, I read then listened, or listened then read, my way through the incredible world that Mr. Martin created.<br /><br />Crows was published a year later. I decided to wait to read it until Dragons was published, as initially the author (or maybe his agents - but I swear I didn't dream this) implied that it was really the second half of Crows, and would hopefully be out in a year. Five years later, Dragons appeared. All I can say is, I am SO glad I waited. A Feast for Crows is full of character development - though most weren't the characters I'd come to love in the previous books. It also ends very abruptly. I finished it and immediately opened Dragons - if I had read it upon publication, as most loyal fans did, I would have been very disappointed.<br /><br />Crows is also the only book of the series that I didn't feel compelled to both read and hear. If I listened to certain chapters on my iPod, I then skipped them in the book. They really weren't worth revisiting - not my experience with the other books. I really want to give this book 3 1/2 stars, but am upping to 4 largely due to the excellence of the overall series. If possible, I would give the first three books a 6 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />So now we wait for the final two books, and all hope that a decade doesn't pass before the story closes. I read somewhere that the author, acknowledging his age, told the creator of the HBO series how the story ends. I don't know if that's true, but truly it's no solace to me. The tv series is good, and interesting - but obviously can't begin to capture the whole story in 10 episodes. Mr. Martin is the only one who can continue the story, and his vehicle is writing. I want the books.<br /><br />My hope is that Mr. Martin is true to the fans that made his career. We are all certainly true to him - though A Feast for Crows is the least of the series, I still recommend it. I have bought it in book format (2: one each for husband/son); Kindle (me); and Audible (me again). I have done the same for the other four books published so far, and recommend the series to family and friends whenever we talk of books (which is often). And honestly, there are so many fans even more devoted than I. So please Mr. Martin - tell us the story, as only you, with your extraordinary skill, can.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie when it would make it to tv. The DVD is even better. No comercials... If you enjoy old war type movies, this is one to add to your collection.
B002VHI8FE|2.0|I tolerated Joe Abercrombie's first great sin for the first 2/3 of this book... His writing style is incredibly obnoxious and cloying at times. Characters will frequently express inner thoughts with staggeringly implausible degrees of insight about each other.<br /><br />I knew I was in trouble when Jezal dan Luthar's first page contained both of the following passages:<br />________<br /><br />\\"He had a faint, mysterious smile which seemed to say, 'I am not a nobleman, and may be your social inferior, but I won a Contest and the King's favour on the battlefield and that makes me the better man, soyou children will damn well do as I say.\\"<br />________<br /><br />Kaspa's look of baffled concentration seemed to say, \\"I am not clever, but honest and likeable, which is much more important. Cleverness is overrated. Oh, and I'm very, very rich, so everyone likes me regardless.\\"<br />________<br /><br />Now...this is just an example, but it illustrated the author's dubious tendency to wrap exposition in a veneer of unearned character clairvoyance. It was the first of many tics that I found incredibly obnoxious, and it only persists as the story goes on.<br /><br />This is a marginally interesting world with characters that strain the generous limits of my sympathy. It was 2/3 into the story that I realized I simply didn't care what happened to any of them. It was also at this point that I realized that very little actual plot had occurred yet. I will usually power through a work (whether film, book, or anything else) in an effort to develop a complete opinion about it, but I must confess, dear review-reader, this one defeated me.<br /><br />I can tolerate either obnoxious writing *or* failing to substantially advance the plot (hell, I'm veteran of Neil Stephenson), but this book's seamless combination of the two was just too much to bear. This book came as a recommendation on io9.com for works to help you wait out the next George R.R. Martin entry in the \\"Song of Ice andFire\\" series. In that light, the kindest thing I can say is that this was an inadequate substitute.
0345505387|1.0|I was so excited to get this book.. but I find I really.. hate it.<br /><br />I also think that the book's pages are out of order, maybe it's a misprint? The story follows no sense of logic or continuity. The storyline about Jamie and that girl that he might have accidentally gotten murdered abruptly stops- Claire enters the scene- and then we're back to the girl he was seeing while he was in France.<br /><br />I have no words besides it was a major let down.

Even though I used to own it (I lost it a while ago) I had to buy it again. and I didnt want to try and download it for free or anything, I'd rather have the actual cd and I didnt mind paying for it again. Anyways... The Used is worth the money! I love them.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Someone please give this author a thesaurus and an editing team that cares. It's not just that the same actions are repeated over and over (and over... and over again), it's that the same words are used to describe them every time. It's like someone put 50 words in a bag, pulled them out and mashed them into a semblance of a sentence, then tossed them back in the bag and repeated the process to fill 300+ pages.<br />Inspired by another review I actually used my Kindle to count the ones that were most painful/annoying to read:<br /><br />Lips bitten: 25<br />Eyes widened: 21<br />Eyes rolled: 51<br />\\"oh my\\": 45<br />Scowls: 48<br />Gasps: 62<br />\\"jeez\\": 76<br />Smirks: 91<br />Flushes/blushes: 133<br />F-bombs dropped: 173<br />Whispers: 251<br /><br />Do the math! Lips are bitten and eyes are widened in every chapter. Someone gasps once every six pages.  The main character \\"flushes\\" at least once every three pages.<br /><br />Yes, the British author uses British colloquialisms that make no sense in the Pacific Northwest. Yes, the female protagonist is two dimensional and boring. Yes, her leading man is given a forced and contrived backstory in an unnecessary attempt to make sense of his kinkiness in a vanilla world. The sex scene was okay the first time I read it, but by the time it was recycled for the twelfth time or so it was just boring. And yes, in between the repetitions listed above the author inexplicably throws whatever was on her \\"word a day calendar\\" into character conversation where it sounds silly and awkward. But none of these things really destroy a good book quite like reading \\"I flush\\" for the hundredth time. Oh my!<br /><br />Apologies to the fans out there. Imagine I'm writing this review with an \\"apologetic smirk.\\"

0880793082|5.0|I've been studying the occult for a good few years now.  Only recently did my interest in occult symbolism and my studies bring me to Aleister Crowley.  I've read so many reviews before choosing [[ASIN:0880793082 Crowley Thoth Small Tarot]], so many people suggest that there are many decks out there for you to get the feel of but I knew this was the one for me.  I love the rich symbolism and artistic brilliance of Lady Frieda Harris.  Each time I shuffle and feel the cards the feeling is strong and positive.  Each glimpse at each card is more brilliant and insightful.<br /><br />I've yet to purchase supplementary materials such as [[ASIN:0877282684 The Book of Thoth: A Short Essay on the Tarot of the Egyptians, Being the Equinox Volume III No. V]].  I plan to learn more from the cards and my understanding of the kabbala and other symbolism.<br />I think the only other deck that attracted me personally would be the [[ASIN:0880796863 The Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack]]
1419702238|5.0|My daughter loves this book and the other Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. I couldn't get her to read anything because of her short attention span. My other daughter reads and reads and reads and reads (everything she gets her hands on); however, my other daughter had no interest in any books no matter what I tried to get for her. Finally, I heard how much she loved the humor in these books from school. She finally has found her love of reading through this author. I thought it might never happen. So thank you Jeff Kinney!! Since she has read each of these books now (most within a day or two because she couldn't put them down), she has gained confidence in her reading abilities and has started to enjoy other books. I am so grateful this author has written these books so kids with a big sense of humor, like she has, and shorter attention spans can also enjoy reading!!

B005JJCMSU|1.0|When watching a good movie, you hardly notice the passage of time as you are swept into the film's world. When watching a bad movie, you notice it all too well as you sit through the tortuous experience of it. This film falls into the latter category, and at only 90 minutes, it feels twice as long, if not longer.<br /><br />This film was bad enough in just the first 10 minutes, seeing the leads not fully committed to their roles, but when the home invaders show up, it only gets worse. There are 4 of them, and 2.5 of them are useless: squeamish leader, coldly efficient muscle, leader's delusional brother and leader's drug addict girlfriend. They present no united front at all; whenever the leader or the muscle starts to step up, the leader's delusional brother steps in (he thinks he and Nicole are destined to be together) or the drug addict girlfriend starts to wig out, forcing the leader or the muscle to deal with them and giving the protagonists plenty of opportunities to fight back. By the time this was over, I was working out in my mind how I would've done it had I possessed the callousness to do it.<br /><br />This one is going on my list of all-time worst movies, joining the likes of [[ASIN:B000HF6XVS Practical Magic]], [[ASIN:B0000TPA0G The Order]], [[ASIN:B0001VTPW2 RoboCop 2]] and [[ASIN:B002VPE1AW Avatar (Original Theatrical Edition)]].

While that is a good part of the book, the chapter that really changed things for me is where Taubes explains the interaction of blood sugar, insulin, and fat.  My low carb diet became a low carb lifestyle at that point, I feel like I know a little more about how my body works now.  I've moved onto \\"good calories, bad calories\\" and have a long list of people whom I want to loan this book to.

B0067QPVJ6|1.0|Am i really seeing four and five star reviews for this travesty?<br /><br />An utter, volatile, disrespectful and tasteless CGI contaminated horror film, that disrespects the GREAT works of John Carpenter and Howard Hawks.<br /><br />I will not give the effort or the energy to review this suspense-less, class-less film. And i apologize to even call this extremely high budgeted, soul-less, disgraceful, shallow piece of commercial nonsense a \\"film\\".  This seems to be the direction which the modern horror film is headed; a place where money is wasted... Like this present day  American administration that bails out the banks and steals the crumbs from the working poor, thus, so does Hollywood, spend multi millions of dollars just to make a profit. This \\"prequel\\" would have been in such better hands with a dedicated film student at your local college, who would have put his or her heart and soul into this concept.. and very well might have succeeded.<br /><br />It seems that like the Banks that have destroyed the trust and commitment of the American people, the corporate film industry has deceived and betrayed us as well. It is very clear that in so many aspects of our lives, all big businesses have no regards for the masses that fatten their pockets.<br /><br />Think I'm being extreme? Well, look at these four and five star reviews for this movie, and tell me they aren't written by those who are financially connected to this failure..<br /><br />I should at least thank the theatre for having a matinee, it would have been a crime to have paid $12.50 to view this.<br /><br />Peace..

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is by far<br />the best I have seen, I love the daily readings and very easy to access.  I highly recommend this app.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game that runs great on my HTC Evo 3D. The graphics and gameplay are just as good as the Playstation 3 version. Is worth the $2.99, so I am even happier I only pages 99 cent. Most 1 star ratings for this game are from morons too stupid to read the incompatibility list and bought it for a phone it doesn't work on.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great way to pass the time. easy play and good graphics. sometimes touch screen is too sensitive but otherwise great easy to use app.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|my son loves this movie and was real excited about cruising lighting and fire tow-mater cars that came with it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very decent version of the game. Nothing too special, but it does what you expect it to do, and does it well. More fun than shuffling... unless Party Rock Anthem comes on, then shuffling is suddenly much more fun.

B003PPDBQ2|5.0|I didn't want this book to finish.  It had me right from the beginning filling me with questions and intrigue as to how this could happen. I loved the way it was written, the author bringing you right in and keeping you there to the end.  It was a very moving book bringing tears to my eyes on many occasions.  I would recommend this book as a \\"must read\\".
B00004RFFS|5.0|This film has very good acting and directing. You would be hard pressed to find so differently with the stars at hand in the picture. The movie focuses on a more dramatic side of vampires, over the classic horror view; however this works in its advantage. It does not overglorify nor does it over dramatize the life of vampires, as one would imagine it to be. This is the way the average person SHOULD think of vampires. Not Twilight, and not 30 Days of Night either. If you want to know what it is to be a vampire, the way you it probably would be if they existed, then this film is for you.
030726999X|4.0|This final volume provides a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, but it might not be the book that fans of the first two in this series expect. In fact, each book in this series actually belongs to a distinct genre--the first is essentially a murder mystery, the second is a blistering psychodrama, and this third one is a crime novel/political thriller/courtroom drama--yet somehow Larsson ties them all together into a coherent and intriguing narrative. The plotting in this one is clever, the characters are well-crafted, and the action moves along at a brisk pace (despite the book's length). I have just two quibbles with this novel--Lisbeth is largely inert through much of the story. Although she utilizes her hacking skills to great effect, she is confined to a hospital bed (and later a prison cell) for the vast majority of the novel. Therefore, if she is indeed \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" she must possess some very long legs indeed. And while I'm at it, here's a side quibble--for a series of novels that condemns and reveals (exploits?) violence that men commit against women, why is the title character referred to as a \\"girl\\" throughout this series? She is, in fact, a strong, resourceful, intelligent, and brave woman. The other substantive quibble regards the character of Erika Berger, the once-and-future-editor of Millennium magazine, who is cyberstalked and endangered by a mysterious assailant in a subplot that seems to contribute very little to the main narrative other than highlighting yet another way in which men victimize women. Larsson is a gifted enough storyteller to have woven this subplot more convincingly into the main narrative, and his failure to do so is somewhat disappointing. These two and a half quibbles aside, however, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is a top-notch thriller and a fitting conclusion to the potboiling Millennium trilogy.

B00159679S|5.0|Act II of the Wieland Wagner production of Tannh&auml;user, Bayreuth, 1962<br />Photo © 1962 Bayreuth Festival/Decca Classics<br />Back in the '90s (I seem to be starting a lot of articles with that sentence these days) the then-record-company Philips released a gigantic 18\\" long 32-CD box set called the \\"Richard Wagner Edition\\", consisting of live recordings of all ten of the major Wagner operas. (H&ouml;llander, Tannha&uuml;ser, Lohengrin, Tristan, Meistersinger, the whole Ring and Parsifal.<br /><br />It was an expensive set, featuring only recordings made at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. Unfortunately some of these recordings, made in conjunction with video productions of Wagner's operas, were of mixed and middling quality. Most notably, the Pierre Boulez-led Ring from the late '70s featured grade-A conducting and a grade-C cast. At the same time, older, \\"historical\\" recordings of better quality were issued at premium prices, some of them only available as imports.<br /><br />This new box set, clunkily titled Wagner: The Great Operas of the Bayreuth Festival (weighing in at 33 discs!) is a welcome arrival. Reasonably priced (given its size), this yellow cardboard box eliminate librettos, essays, booklets, jewel boxes and slipcases in favor of simple white envelopes for the discs. Tannh&auml;user, Tristan, Meistersinger. and Parsifal are the same as the earlier set. Let's look at those first.<br /><br />The 1962 Sawallisch recording of Tannh&auml;user features great performances from Wolfgang Windgassen and Grace Bumbry, the mezzo who broke the color barrier at Bayreuth. It is an odd mix of the \\"Dresden\\" and \\"Paris\\" editions of the score. The 1966 Karl B&ouml;hm Tristan pits Windgassen's fiery tenor against the icy power of Birgit Nilsson's soprano. She is not to be messed with. He ain't bad either. Each act fits on a single disc, and was recorded on a separate day. This enabled Windgassen and Nilsson to sing at full blast.<br /><br />The 1974 Meistersinger under Silvio Varviso is a muddle, with a mediocre Walther (Jean Cox) and Eva (Hannelore Bode), and lots of clattery stage noises. However, it boasts a great Hans Sachs from underrated hausbariton Karl Ridderbusch and fine comic timing from the ensemble cast. The final recording to reappear from the old set is the 1985 Parsifal, led at a snail's pace by James Levine is also a mixed bag, capturing an early performance from Waltraud Meier as Kundry (which is good) and a late one from Peter Hoffmann (which is not.). Able support is provided by Hans Sotin (Gurnemanz) and Simon Estes (Amfortas) and the choral singing is excellent. However, the best Bayreuth Parsifal remains the 1962 live recording under Hans Knappertsbutsch.<br /><br />Now for the good stuff. This set flanks the 1962 Sawallisch Tannha&uuml;ser nicely by including his generally excellent recordings of Der Fliegende H&ouml;llander (1961) and Lohengrin (1962). All three feature Swedish soprano Anja Silja, who was still a teenager when she sang the leading roles of Senta, Elisabeth and Elsa at the Festspielhaus. (It didn't hurt matters either that she was the girlfriend of Festival co-director Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson.)<br /><br />Silja is incandescent in the Lohengrin, just one jewel in an amazing cast that features Franz Crass, Ramon Vinay, supersoprano Astrid Varnay (the scariest Ortrud ever!) and Jess Thomas as Lohengrin. Best of all, this is one of those \\"just stand there\\" Wieland Wagner productions, so there is almost no stage noise, just great singing.<br /><br />Finally, the new Wagner box includes the complete 1967 Karl B&ouml;hm Ring. Once again, the set features Nilsson and Windgassen as Brunnhilde and Siegfried. And yes, their chemistry is real, and even better here than on the studio-recorded Solti Ring with the Vienna Philharmonic. But the real treasure of this excellent, energetic Ring is the performance of Leonie Rysanek as Sieglinde in Die Walk&uuml;re. This Walk&uuml;re sets the gold standard for this opera, complete with the famous, theatrically orgasmic scream (a Wieland addition) at the end of the first act.<br /><br />The Siegfried is one of the best readings of Wagner's fairy tale. Windgassen's unflagging energy a wonder to behold. B&ouml;hm, a Strauss protege and a man of the theater, shows his bespectacled brilliance on the podium, bringing the final bars of G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung home in a blaze of orchestral color.<br /><br />(Note to Wagner nuts: Yes, this is the same controversial production of the Ring in which Wieland cut Gutrune's short scene out of Act III of G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung. However the performance on these discs includes the missing scene, restored to its proper place.)famous, theatrically orgasmic scream (a Wieland addition) at the end of the first act.<br /><br />The Siegfried is one of the best readings of Wagner's fairy tale. Windgassen's unflagging energy a wonder to behold. Böhm, a Strauss protege and a man of the theater, shows his bespectacled brilliance on the podium, bringing the final bars of Götterdämmerung home in a blaze of orchestral color.<br /><br />(Note to Wagner nuts: Yes, this is the same controversial production of the Ring in which Wieland cut Gutrune's short scene out of Act III of Götterdämmerung.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely love this book along with the others! Even made my husband read a little bit of it and he got into it and ended up reading the whole thing!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like the pace and scaling of the game.  I'm looking forward to beating the whole game.  Love the artwork.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game! So exciting and it exercises your brain! What a great game! From 1-10, I give it a 1,000!!!!
B003UAMWWQ|4.0|Spaceballs is how you do a great spoof of a movie classic. Spaceballs creates a set of characters that perfectly echo and poke fun at the main characters in Star Wars, although it combines Luke and Han into the character of Lone Star. The only part that went too far for me wast Yogurt and the Schwartz - the little Spaceballs merchandising store was a bit tacky. The film also uses a lot of techniques, including slapstick and breaking down the \\"fourth wall\\", that unfortunately have gone out of vogue. For that reason alone it's worth watching for film buffs who appreciate innovative styles of filmmaking.
1451627289|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King in a few years, but I am so glad my husband bought this book for me.  The Stand is probably my all time favorite book because to this day I can still think about that book and wonder what Frannie and Stu are doing.  This book has characters - Sadie and Jake that will have you doing the same thing.  They were wonderfully developed and I really felt like I got to know them personally.  Stephen King is the master of this and I highly recommend this book.  It is a very enjoyable read!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This series is so difficult to dislike.  Bryan Cranston is so terrific in this role as are all the actors, esp the young guy who plays Jessie.  Really keeps you engrossed!
B0026P3G12|5.0|The wonderful electricity of Susan Boyle's introduction to the general public lives on with this collection of songs.  Susan's voice is like being wrapped in a warm blanket, sitting before a fire with your loved one in your arms.  These polished, studio perfected songs do justice to the almost forgotten voice of a woman from the ranks of the middle-class, who dreamed a dream in front of her nation, indeed, in front of the world.  My wife and I love to listen to Susan.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|The pocket-pal is a convenient pocket sharpener, and performs well enough to dress an edge on a blade to get you by. Don't expect Razor -like quality, but good enough till you can get to a honing set. The diamond steel is most effective and versatile. Get this below 10$, and it's a deal.
0312641893|5.0|Cool and clever! This book is a mash-up of Cinderella, Star Wars, Terminator, and (maybe only to me) Disney's Treasure Planet seemed to sneak in there too. Loved the characters and the evil stepmother was perfect for a futuristic scene. So many compliments are due...I don;t know where to start, how to elaborate, or where I should stop. I REALLY liked this one, and I'm a dude. If you're a girl who likes YA, then pick this up. If you're a guy, give it a shot before you shoot it down because of the big high heel on the front cover.<br /><br />Overall: Really liked it like I said. Very cool spin on an old story. I would recommend this to just about anybody that is diligent enough to read a book all the way through.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and this app is great! it is just as good as the computer!! I would definitely recommend this app.  this one is like the others but much more challenging than normal which I tend to like because some.solitaires are too easy and I enjoy challenges.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|What do you mean your last post? What about your fans? The first I do in the mornings with my cup of coffee is look up your review of the day. I'm very late reading it today because my co-worker came to work throwing up everywhere, sick from the flu. I had to coax him back home with an electric cattle prod, but that's beside the point...I expect to read your review in the morning or else.....
B005D81W5Q|5.0|Love this movie. While this movie is certainly for adults and not one I would watch around kids it is very entertaining.  I didn't notice much difference between the unrated edition and the regular edition.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It doesn't work on the Android flagship device, absolutely pathetic. Now that more phones are getting ICS you'll see this rating go down the tubes
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Really like my Garmin.  Had the older model for several years.  This one is much smaller and lighter.  Took a little time to figure out the controls since a lot of functions are tied to touching the bezel, but works great once you learn your way around.  I don't use half the watch's capabilities (analyzing training history stuff).  I mostly use it to track my time, distance and pace.  Great product at great price.
B005FITIK0|5.0|Young Adult is the best I have seen in a long time. Charlize Theron is beautiful as always, but more importantly, portrays Mavis like no other actor could.  She was perfect as the flawed, lonely, aging prom queen. Patton Oswalt (as Matt) was wonderful and the best friend Mavis could  have had if only she had known that 20 years earlier. The other outstanding character and probably my favorite was Sandra (Collette Wolfe), Matt's sister. Her conversation with Mavis in the last 10 minutes of the movie is so great. Collette Wolfe, you were wonderful!

B0073LWEXK|4.0|The graphics are great however the ending sucked. Will definitely pass the time while providing some amusement.  The price could be a tad bit lower but it's a decent game.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I feel that this book helped me to understand more about myself. The Western world certainly emphasized extrovert values and sometimes forgets that introverts offer a useful perspective too. Susan Cain writes well about the benefits of both the extrovert and introvert style. A must read for those quieter souls.
006197806X|5.0|I LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK!! I lost my original copy and have yet to been able to find it. I lost it while reading and this book was so good I bought again because I wanted to finish reading it! I loved the complexcity of this book. It kept me guessing the whole time and I felt what Lena was going through. I couldn't put it down! Lauren Oliver is such a fantastic writer! I can't wait for the third one next year!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book. The author makes you think a lot about moral dilemmas. Also, the characters are well developed. I don't read a lot of fiction, but I found this book easy to get into.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|It's a good movie, I recommend it because the plot is interesting, curious to know more about the epic battle between angels and demons and how humans are in it, draws you to see it through.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must admit I started this book like ok and was able to put it down after the first chapter. I think the fact that I read that a local 7th grade class will be reading this, I think its a bit to much for them. I am angry reading it, but knowing how mindless and sometimes cruel our own culure can be about our own suffering; I can see it. And I think that might be what drew me in, or maybe the relationship between the two in the woods. Sparks fly and I mean literly. You see this character change and now lost within herself. You cry and laught and well then I dont have then next book so now I cant wait to see what happens next.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|The movie is great, the visuals are awesome, fights, explosions, music, are extraordinary.<br />It is also always good to see how a man can change the course of a nation by the power of a vision.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I use to watch this movie with my little brother and sister. I enjoy this movie so much. It is funny with great animation. This is a must see movie.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I've seen the trilogy of X-Men, and was waiting for this movie to see if it was the level of its predecessors and I have to say that I have been satisfied. The plot of the movie is very good, the way the story unfolds is great and leaves out the fact that no such action.<br />Also, most importantly see Professor Xavier and Magneto in their infancy and how they went from being great friends to be enemies.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I love this movie. I enjoy true story's, but I think at the moment this movie is the best true story movie that I own. I cry every time I watch it. It is sad to think someone went threw life like he did. It is sad to think that people are going threw life like that now.

B005K17RU0|5.0|while I have only been using this app for about two weeks, I must say that it is pretty solid all around.

B006ZT47O0|5.0|I'm going to make this review brief and straight to the point. Epica have accomplished the impossible task of not only matching their previous album \\"design your universe\\", but topping it in every way possible. gone are the corny narrative lines, replaced only by killer riffage, excellent solos, brilliant orchestrations, brutal growling, (marks best to date), and the monumental voice of simone simons. she improves on every album, each time exploreing new elements of her voice. buy it!
B001GQ2BNQ|2.0|I bought this snorkel and the swimmers snorkel (has no purge valve) to see which was more comfortable.<br />I like the swimmer's snorkel better.  It's more comfortable and is easier for me to breath with than this freestyle snorkel
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is a great movie at a great buy! I recommend it highly! You will watch it over and over.
B007BDK3SS|2.0|seems like a good game. good graphics, physics, etc. but on my galaxy nexus for some reason the tilt controls do not work. if an update came out for this I would change my rating but until then it will stay low.
B001F12J48|1.0|I agree with the reviewers who say this movie is destined to be an all time Christmas classic.  The Polar Express is an excellent movie with a great message, effects and sound.  I recommend this movie to everyone.  With that said, I believe we're here to review the sale of this particular disc set (The Polar Express Presented in 3-D (2004) for $7.79), not the movie itself.  If you're looking to buy The Polar Express in 3D, don't bother buying the disc set that states \\"Presented in 3D\\" on the front cover.  This is not true 3D.  It comes with 4 pair of passive 3D glasses; which will just give you a headache the first two minutes of viewing.  I tried using the Active 3D glasses from my Sony Theater system, but they just kept turning off because there was no 3D signal coming from the sync transmitter; an indication this disc is not 3D.  Another disappointment was that there were some scenes missing between the two disc included in this set.  We viewed both discs and found that each disc contained some scenes the other disc didn't have.  For these reasons I am only giving this purchase one star; because I didn't get what I thought I purchased.  I blame myself for not reading the reviews before purchasing.  This experience is a reminder that \\"You Only Get What You Pay For\\". .I should have realized that $7.79 was not going to get me this great movie in 3D.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|Super fun book,after reading it I couldn't wait to get part two and I'm excited about his third book coming in July.Just pre-ordered it in fact.I think Suarez is going to be better than Criton by far.Daemon and Freedom were both fun books.<br /><br />Some of the ideas that are in this book I'd love to see become reality.The ability for people to be able to vote on issues instantly and then be made reality instantly was fun to daydream about.The world he creates in these books would be better than the world we currently have.Though I wouldn't want chainsaw weilding motorcycles chasing people down,the rest of it I mean:-)<br /><br />Fun book,well worth the time.I only see him compared to Michael Criton(Chrichton?Can't remember how to spell his name)to me that isn't quite accurate,I'd add Stephen King as well and even John Grisham.There's no court room stuff but his writing still reminded me a little of Grisham.Page turning barn burner.Fun book:-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided I should read it since the movie is coming out soon and I like to read books prior to seeing the movie.  What a great decision!  From the very first chapter I was hooked and could not put it down.  The characters are memorable and I was completely taken in by the emotion the books evoked.  After reading the first book via a loan, I immediately bought the entire trilogy.  All 3 were great reads and I highly recommend them!

I cannot wait until the next book is released!<br /><br />If you are looking for something to get you by between the books and enjoy Lauren Oliver's writing as much as I do, you should check out Before I Fall. It was another excellent book.

030788743X|5.0|My 14 year old son is a reluctant reader who adores video games. This book was a great choice for him because of the subject matter. He loved the book, found it easy to read and it captured his attention entirely. Recommended for anyone who loves video games and has always thought it would be cool to live inside of one.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So I bought this DVD for my wife to help add some excitement to her workout routine. She absolutely loves it! She told me the beginner level was one of the best workouts she has had in a long time, and it was fun to do. She is very pleased with this product and we even bought Jillian Michaels new \\"Kickbox FastFix\\" DVD because she licked it so much. Looks like a lot of fun; I might even try it with her some time.
B00012L786|5.0|I am a long time fan of Richard Widmark for his acting skill and Jean Peters for her beauty. However, I have mixed feelings about film noir movies -- some are quite good but others are just depressing. Pickup on South Street is a good film noir movie. But, as a fan of both Widmark and Peters, their presence added to my enjoyment of this film which I consider to be one of my favorites.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This looks like it would be a fun game but will not run on Asus Transformer running ICS. Game starts but locks up in menus.

1741048303|1.0|I stupidly bought this on Kindle before heading out to Indonesia. I've been using it for the last week and am pretty disappointed. The thing is, I feel stupid because I *knew* LP had gone downhill... I just hoped that they might have gotten their act together.<br /><br />The main problem with LP is that they became successful. Once, you could rely on a fairly complete rundown of all the town's ramshakle inns, hostels, and eateries. No longer. About half the book is devoted to activities that might best be described as \\"Fodorland\\".  You know: \\"If you want the very *best* French pastries, here's where to go.\\" \\"Yes, the Ritz Carlton is respectable at $120 a night, but for the best spa offerings spend a little more and book at the Astoria.\\"  I DID NOT SPEND TWENTY-SIX HOURS ON A PLANE TO LAND IN JAKARTA AND EAT FRENCH PASTRIES!  LP authors are obviously now overfunded and spoiled.<br /><br />And also lazy. I can't tell you how many times I looked for how to do something and the guide basically says \\"The tourist office should be able to help you with...\\". Well, no ship!  The frequent excuse for this is, \\"Well, things change constantly...\\".  Yeah, so get out there more often and update the guide more frequently!<br /><br />As an example: nowhere does it tell you where to take cooking classes outside of Bali. Nowhere does it mention that there is a local train from Bogor to Sukabumi... And NOT from Sukabumi to Bandung (despite there being a track!). Buses from Bogor to Cipinas?  Didn't see it. Car rental?  Niltch.  Also, what happened to the \\"Highlights\\"?  I don't need an itinerary, I need a list of must-sees.<br /><br />Disappointing.  I'll update more later.
B005CIWNJG|1.0|I haven't purchased this book yet but I believe $20 is too much for this e-book compared to others.<br /><br />Publishers need to get serious about promoting the digital age. Sale volumes may increase significantly if prices were lowered.

B004IJZFP4|1.0|Very disappointed and had I stopped to read more about it, I would have let this one gather dust in some warehouse.  Why Wild Dogs, the original song that drove me to Sound Warehouse the minute I heard it ther day it was released, is not available in any form other than the original vinyl, is ridiculous.  While he was a shooting star that burned out far too early, his original recording should be available.<br /><br />Just another example of others trying to profit from the artistic efforts of one that is no longer with us.<br /><br />I will be sure to read more about CD's in the future that carry the qualifier \\"deluxe\\", because there's not one selection as good as the originals.  It's like putting the demo reels on CD's for full price.  Did they use the full band or professional production techniques like mixing on the demo?  But, they want to charge full price for that.  I gave this one star just because I am a Tommy Bolin fan and not a fan of the people who put this pap on a piece of plastic.

B003TJR2HS|1.0|I ordered this for my 2009 Subaru Impreza because my Iphone 4S and new Ipod Nano would not work in my car. From what I read in the reviews, this should have worked. Mine still does not work in my car.
B006SVHOL8|1.0|This movie practically had an all star cast but the acting was unconvincing.  Something was weird about the filming too. It was like the whole movie was filmed through a grungy yellowed lense. Oh well. It was a waste but you can't win them all. I definitely will not be purchasing this movie for my favorites collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|While the premise of the book was disturbing, it was written in such a way that I got passed the \\"fight to the death\\" purpose.  I loved it.  Plan on getting the next 2 books and seeing the movie.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I don't think I've read books where the couple are more suited to each other than this. THEY ARE BOTH BIPOLAR! My goodness, in between her happiness, then sadness, then smirks, then crying, then feelings of insecurity, then scared, then nervous, then lets herself be punished cause Christian is so hot and he is hers, then unsure, then happy again, then sad, then outspoken, then submissive. Get where I am going here? And then we have the super rich and super hot Christian. He had scars from the past that haunts him. He likes to punish, then kiss and make up, then get angry, then smirks, then twist his lips frequently, then tells Ana not to bite her lip over and over again. He's happy, then sad, then mad, and it just goes on and on. I'm not going to even go into the words and phrases that were repeated over and over again. But, hey, if this is your cup of tea, by all means, drink your fill!
006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium picks up right where Delirium left off. Lena's in the wilds and she's desperately trying to cope to her new life. One of the things I loved the most about this book was the HUGE amount of growth you can see in Lena.<br /><br />She's given up so much - her family, her friends (Hana!) and Alex - and it's shaped her in a way she can never reverse. The Lena in Delirium is naive and unsuspecting. The Lena in Pandemonium is fierce and harsh and full of raw anger and hatred.<br /><br />Honestly, she kinda scared the crap out of me! The girl is a beast! But all of that is to say that her story takes interesting turns and twists because Lena is deciding how she wants to live now that she's free of her old life.<br /><br />Knowing that Alex wouldn't even be apart of Lena's story anymore was pretty killer (no pun intended). Even though in my review of Delirium I said that I was a tad confused by their relationship, I still liked them.<br /><br />But but but but but but Julian. Wow. Yeah. Julian Fineman is the son of Thomas Fineman, the head of the DFA (this hardcore anti-deliria force). Because of the clearly marked signs saying \\"this is a forbidden attraction\\" they obviously are drawn together like to magnets.<br /><br />I love where Oliver takes Lena and Julian. It's seriously more intense and exciting than Lena and Alex's relationship ever was in my opinion. Plus, I felt like I understood their attraction, where as with Alex it was unclear to me what he saw in Lena (lack of description, maybe?)<br /><br />Pandemonium is broken into two types of chapters titled \\"Then\\" and \\"Now.\\" The story jumps from when Lena was first thrust into the Wilds with a rag-tag team of misfits and when she's working undercover to tail Julian and find out more about the DFA. Oliver handles the shift very well, and I never felt like I was missing anything or that the jumps in time where too abrupt.<br /><br />I will say though, that there are a few scenes in the book that seem to go on forever. Maybe it's because I like the books vs. fangirling like crazy that I got a little tired of certain situations.<br /><br />Also, I started thinking halfway through the book - where is this going? I had no idea what life or person Lena was moving toward becoming or what the whole point of the book was.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />Oliver's strong writing skills and deft storytelling bring readers into Lena's new harsh, bitter reality. The exciting and intense romance in the book creates a stark contrast with the survival of the fittest environment. With a absolutely torturous cliffhanger, Pandemonium ends like it starts: with a bang.orever.

B007BLDFWG|1.0|Yeah, I am with all the other bad reviews.  It was very disappointing, and sloooooow.<br /><br />This film would have worked better back in the late 60s and 70s, when kids ran away from home and joined communes.  Everyone shares every thing, including their bodies.  It just doesn't work in this millennium.<br /><br />Basic Plot:  Martha's mother dies.  Her sister is in college.  She lives with a bitch of an aunt.  She runs away and is taken in by a farm commune.  Two years later, she's had enough and phones her sister to come and get her.  Her sister soon discovers that Martha has really radical ideas about money, property, open sex, etc.<br /><br />There is a major plot hole:  Did Martha not have a personality and values prior to joining the commune?  She acts like she is a visitor from another planet who does not understand communistic farm life or human relationships.  She is a dumb valueless lump of clay that they can mold.  Who was she for the first 18 years of her life?<br /><br />Pass on this one.  Save your money and wait for it to come on HBO or Showtime if you are curious.
1594202842|4.0|Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is a well-written book.  Despite its literary merits, I noticed that it also has a little bit of the \\"tell-all\\" feel of a reality TV show to it.<br /><br />I couldn't believe how openly Amy Chua shares her family dirt.  I just couldn't stop reading, and I loved every minute of it.  Wow.  Although I really agreed with much of what she said in this book, I was struck by how open a target she made herself, really portraying herself as the antithesis of most upper-middle class American parents.  Nothing was off-limits:  family fights were described in detail!  It was really brave of her to divulge such personal details, especially where child rearing is concerned, because most people seem to feel free to criticize other people's parenting unabashedly, even when the parenting techniques aren't nearly as far from the American mainstream as Ms. Chua's are.<br /><br />After reading this book, I came to two conclusions:<br /><br />1.  Being a child of the Tiger Mother might sometimes feel like the worst fate on earth.<br /><br />2.  I kind of wish that my parents had put a bit more \\"Tiger Mother\\" into their parenting because I would have almost surely achieved more as a youth than I did.  Lots of wasted years spent watching TV for six hours a day during my childhood.  Now, as a middle-aged adult, I wish that I had that time back or had at least spent it in a more productive manner.<br /><br />Kudos to Ms. Chua for working so hard to do what she feels is right for her children.
B006KSAPV0|3.0|No, I am not going to ruin the film for you.  Go ahead and watch it.<br /><br />The film is not shot in a straight time-line.  It continually gives you large chunks of flashbacks.  This is done to fool you with the ending.  At the end, count on your fingers the major illogical plot twists -- I counted three.<br /><br />If the film was shot in proper time sequence, I think you would have said WTF about half way through it.
B000Z27HLS|2.0|This movie was poorly acted and does not compare to Pride & Prejudice, Emma, or any of the others.  I would skip this.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|I don't have a collection of multi tools but I can only say I love this item, using it very frequently. It's handy, useful, compact, easy to use and always works whenever you need it, especially the sharp compact knife and scissors(so far in a urban environment). I guess it would do the trick in any circumstances including survival. My advise: get it for that price and quality!
B006M6NV0M|3.0|We are Segal fans, so found that the humor was put on. But, that is Stallone. Alot of action in the end, worth waiting for.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Thought this might be just good enough for an apartment where there is about 6 feet from the TV. Makes hand gestures jumpy and erratic and pretty much a waste of time. I just used a [[ASIN:B0040Y3K9U Xbox 360 Kinect Wall Mount]] for the added space and it works wonders, it sits about a two feet behind my TV and gives me the added space I needed.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My fiance has been trying to get me to try this and I thought it was stupid and wouldn't.  He bought me a Kindle for Valentine's day and immedialty downloaded this onto my Kindle and made me try it.  Well, I am addicted as much as he is now ;)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this book because I heard several people talking about it.  I could NOT put it down.  One cannot stop at the end of a chapter because the author  writes in such a way as to invite you to read the next chapter.  I loved it so much that I read the next two books in in the series.  It is very enjoyable.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow is a Nelwyn (small person) farmer and aspiring wizard.  His children find a baby on the river banks and the village decides the next day that Willow and a team should head into the world of the Daikini (standard sized people - I apologize, I don't know what term to use) to return the baby to her people.  The first person the team finds is Madmartigan, a warrior, who has been imprisoned in a large cage.  They free him in exchange for his promise to take the baby to a woman who would care for it.  Thus starts the journey of Willow and Madmartigan to return the baby, defeat an evil witch and her army, return a good witch to her human form, escape trolls, find love, return home, and inspire the people of their lands.<br /><br />I love this movie.  I have since I was a child and first saw it, I loved it through all the re-runs on HBO in my teens, and I love it today.  It's a simple story of love, selflessness, self-belief, and good vs. evil.  I've loved this so much that, for a book report I had to do in 7th grade, I read the book and created a newspaper, complete with Bavmorda's obituary - I believe it was titled \\"Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead\\" - I was quite creative back then.<br /><br />The storyline isn't unique; I've seen better sword fights in the Highlander, better special effects in Syfy's Dr. Who, better acting in Murder She Wrote, and I'm pretty sure that my 5th grade music class could write a better score.  BUT, just like [[ASIN:B00005LKHZ The Neverending Story]], [[ASIN:B00007JMDY Lucas]], [[ASIN:B0001Z37HM Red Sonja]], and [[ASIN:B000P0J09W The Goonies]], it holds a special place in my heart.<br /><br />On top of being a simple, fun story about triumphing over the things that would hold you down, the movie is a delightful foray into a lush, magical fantasy land.  I don't recall any bad language, but there is some content that might be a bit graphic for children:  Madmartigan is found in a brothel at one point, some of the scenes with Bavmorda and/or the trolls might be a bit scary for younger children, and there are fight scenes in which soldiers are mortally wounded.  As Willow is a small person, there is a bit of name calling - the Daikini's call Nelwyn's \\"Pecks\\", but Willow, like any underdog hero, rises above the derisive nicknames of others to prove himself to be more than worthy of their respect.<br /><br />If you've never seen the movie and has a fondness for David and Goliath stories, I highly recommend it.he trolls might be a bit scary for younger children, and there are fight scenes in which soldiers are mortally wounded.

B006PHD0RW|4.0|Love it, but the developers need to change how the food items rotate. Trying to rotate a banana with two fingers is difficult. Make it a simple double click to rotate each way and the game's frustration level is removed. When rotating is an essential part of figuring out multiple bags, it shouldn't be this hard. Change that, and you get five stars.
B006HC9AUG|4.0|I found the camera idea a bit too clever and it made the production too dark. Yes it is well sung and acted but the Flute is an opera that thrives on magic, colour and costume. There are other productions about, notably by Opera Australia, that bring this most wonderful of operas to life even better and I hope they will soon get a Blu-ray recording. In the meantime I found this better than the Covent Garden production but not by a lot and neither quite meet my aspirations.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is epic.I named my restrunt is called the meaty cheat.its just like real life ive always wanted to own a reastrunt.
0307455874|4.0|I'm not normally a non-fiction reader, but I thought it would be important to read a little from our president.  I'm glad I pushed myself to be patient with the book because after reading it, I feel like I understand him better.  It's sad that he won't be able to achieve the America he talks about it the book, though.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Kind of girlish because of its size, great automatic entry level automatic watch though. Looses its wind in a couple of days if not used.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|While this is not a spectacular movie, it held my interest well, was well written, and well acted.  The language was horrible, but that's a given with most Clooney movies.  It's the story of how a family handles tragedies, triumphs, and life.  The Hawaiian setting and intermittent Hawaiian music were nostalgic and delightful.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|this game is pretty fun when you have hours to spare. not the best at it but getting there. they only negative comments I have is I don't like how hard it is to earn gems and the food take a long time to cook but that just may be how these games work.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|G5 has come through with another great game. The graphics on Kindle Fire make finding the objects enjoyable especially since you can zoom in. I like that I can skip the mini games and get hints. Some may find this to easy but I hate getting stuck &amp; frustrated. I usually play the free version and purchase if I like the game.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Is it possible to throw and not get a gutter ball? ive tried time and time again to make anything. just one pin down... but nope. I honestly dont know if anyone else is having this problem but it is bothering me tons. deleted app.
0385535139|5.0|I am a huge fan of John Grisham, I found this story to bring out the humor in the author. I laughed out loud many times. While presenting a homorous story, Grisham also lets you in on the shady side of mass tort law. The money, the strategies, the corruption ,the egos, the power and the deciet. A truly delightful story, Grisham has another winner.
B000GLKLCK|1.0|I like the music and the performance, but the production of this has serious issues!! None of the cd's have any written data to identify each track and there are 82 tracks in the set. Downloaded onto my iTunes and it just lists \\"Track 1\\" \\"Track 2\\" etc. which is not a lot of help when you're looking for a specific movement of a specific concerto. I've resorted to typing all the information into iTunes by hand. Argh. Also, the play times on the slipcover of each CD do not match the actual length of each selection. For example, CD slipcover says Allegro, 1st mvt. from K. 37 lasts 5'20, but the cd on my iTunes reads 5'24. This is bewildering because you have to go on faith that the track listed in iTunes is actually the one on that slipcover, unless you already know the concerto well and can verify its identity by hearing it.<br /><br />My set was purchased new, and seemed thus when I received it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the game it is kool. I like to play it when I am bord. so I think that u should get this game its very fun. but some of the mini games r confusing.
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|Really enjoy the app on the Kindle Fire.  Only downside is incompatibility  with some sites ' picture and video playback. Updates are frequent though! Thanks again Google, for another awesome app!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Can't rate the case since I don't have one yet.  I have a KF and in need of a case to protect the device and to eliminate having the KF power off while reading.  When the device is propped on a book stand (while on a treadmill) the power button is triggered and it either goes into sleep mode or is powered off.  Does this case offset this problem?  I'm frustrated with this annoying issue with this KF, but otherwise love the KF...Help Please with this poor design of the power button location.

0062082353|5.0|That was the fastest i've EVER read a book! I felt it was good to hear the side of a soldier who was actually there. I get tired of the news reporting things how they want to report it, tilting the story to whichever party they represent or only including the details they are told to report. So sad how easy it becomes to kill, but we've seen how easy it is for terrorists or psychos to kill us (whether from our country or not), so i definitely understand and back Chris' reasoning. Thank you for keeping us safe! ALL of you soldiers!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is a really interesting book for both young people and those who grew up during the 1980s.  It is a true page-turner and it is a great book for book club discussions.  We ere a 10th grade student and parent book club and the book generated great discussions among everyone.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game is broken all I get is a black screen on my tf101. Don't waste your time if you own an ics device too, the game will run poorly. Ill make sure popcap wont get anymore of my money
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is addicting and fun you can talk to people leave messages and make new friends best game ive play so far.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I'll add to the chorus and say that this entire series was superb.  The writing was excellent and the series definitely led you to care deeply about the characters without moving the focus away from the level of young adult fiction.  Adult readers may have to suspend disbelief in some places where there are very teen centric scenes played out against a larger political and military landscape but they do not detract from the book in any way.<br /><br />The books are quite dark and parents of younger children would be well advised to read these books first to determine suitability.  That said, I think that the themes of the book are important for young adults to read and would definitely recommend this series unreservedly.
0525478817|5.0|This book was so amazing, I don't even know where to begin.  It's written as if John Green has experienced cancer personally (or has really done his research).  It's difficult to believe that Hazel and Augustus are fictional characters - their experiences are candid.  It was unbelievably sad but I didn't feel as if it was exploiting the sadness of cancer just to sell books.  Just a great great book.  I can't recommend it enough
B007IQX9ZW|2.0|This is not a \\"comedy.\\"  Anyone using that word should a.) examine the definition of comedy - dark or otherwise or b.) get some counseling.  Very little amusing in this pretentious chracter study.  The acting is fine, but no one is realy likeable or given much depth.  WAY too much is spoken and not enough is shown.  Cody and Reitman are critic darlings, but this film is just wholly flat and leaves you wanting something - anything - more.
B004SBX112|5.0|it is so cool get all of the angry birds. it is worth 99 cents. it is so fun to play. get it now
B007BDK3SS|3.0|I loved the first Trial X, then played the winter version of 2 when it was the free app of the day. I must say it was like night and day all the differences! So here we are with the normal version of two. It's just what I was expecting from the Winter Edition, but for some reason the tilt controls do not work. At least I'm not the only one experiencing this mishap. Long story short, the game would be awesome if the tilt controls worked. The button controls are too awkward for me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|best game on the apps library by far, ive been playing non stop for 2 days now and cant put it down. recommended for sure, wish I would've downloaded the game a long time ago! has the perfect mix of sports, action, skill and shooting games.
0545265355|5.0|I read these books like there was no tomorrow because the story is absolutely amazing.  I have a nephew who is 13 who loved it, a wife (29) who loved it, and many friends that loved it.  So I gave it a shot, bought this trilogy (which actually was cheaper and more aestheticall pleasing on the bookshelf as this set than buying each book separately new) and immediately fell in love.  Highly recommended, even for a 29 year old man.  The plot flows really well, the story is enthralling and very original.  Collins does a great job at keeping you focused on the story and writes very well.  The third book wasn't my favorite and you'll see why when you read it.  I just didn't like the ending as much.  However, as a whole, this series is absolutely amazing.  A fast read, and extremely addicting.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! I loved it enough to buy it for sure! Much more thought provoking than most. Way better writing!<br /><br />This one was different. Too many of these romantic comedies  today are just the same formula with different actors. In most they start out not liking each other, learn to love each other, have a big break up then get back together at the last minute. Same old, same old. In this one they loved each other from the beginning. It was self doubt that kept them apart and a false friend that was such a narcissistic sociopath that she couldn't stand for one minute letting her \\"best friend\\" ever out do her in anyway. Kate Hudson plays this villain, bless her heart. I thought it was really big of her to play second fiddle and such an unlikable character.<br /><br />This Romantic Comedy was actually more realistic than most. It was complicated. The relationships were complicated, the characters were complicated and yet it had it's really funny moments some of which ended up on the cutting room floor so PLEASE WATCH THE EXTRAS! The funniest scene was cut out. I loved John Kranski in this and I was rooting for him to get the girl and still am because after the credits start to roll KEEP WATCHING! They run a little bit THEN THERE IS ANOTHER SCENE and it says TO BE CONTINUED..... I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!! I will definitely go to see it in theaters!!
B000VX4X36|5.0|I've been wearing these shoes to work about 90% of the time for the last five years. They look good in the office--respectable with some slacks and a tie, or with jeans and a jacket. I work at a desk, but I also inspect properties. They have held up really well over the last five years and I plan to keep wearing them and potentially will have the soles replaced when they wear out, which I anticipate to not be for another year or two. They need to be polished up, but they have so far stood the test of time. $100-120 seems like a lot to spend, but they will last...
B005HEFCPM|2.0|You'd think after being burned so many times these people would know better than to take in someone who was a little too eager to get on board their ship. It never ends well for them.<br /><br />Considering how often they seem to be boarded and attacked, they should've replaced most of the crew with military personnel.<br /><br />Another slight ramp up in the Xindi plot, with more in-fighting amongst them, and continuing thin reasoning behind this burning need for genocide.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love The Big Bang Theory. This makes my collection complete until more are release. Delivery was fast and product was satisfactory.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am happy that I was able to get Angry Birds for free. It is a cute game that I enjoy playing. There are many different levels, some of which are challenging. This game is fun for someone of any age and it works great on the Kindle Fire!
B006ON41FC|1.0|This game is addictive and fun.  So why the one star?  Because I am reviewing this game against my will.  Every time I start the game I am prompted to rate it.  So I am now doing so, but under protest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun great many chances to.earn free points many great games you can play you should get this game if you like having fun
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Shiver is a good book for anyone. It's the perfect combination of drama, love, secrets, and sarcasm. It's a refreshing mix of Twilight and The Hunger Games in one package. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat and always trying to guess what might happen next. The Wolves of Mercy Falls series will be the next book-to-movie. The only complaint would be that, you might have a problem finishing everyday tasks because Shiver will distract your attention. A must-read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have EVO 4g. pretty old phone . it runs just fine. graphics are good gameplay is fine. if my phone can run it yours can to.
B006FE83U4|5.0|I'm sure everyone by now is familiar with this movie, so a review of the movie is not necessary (it's just plain GREAT). This is a review of the 50th Anniversary Blu-ray edition. With many movies, the blu-ray transfer is sloppy, but not with this classic. It was \\"digitally remastered and fully restored from high resolution 35mm original film elements.\\" It is gorgeous. Universal did this movie proud. I've seen this movie many times, but watching it on blu-ray, was like a whole new experience. The depth of the tones in black and white, sets it apart from many color movies. It's just beautiful. The sound was crisp and clear, plus all the \\"extras\\" were really extras worth watching. Don't hesitate to buy the blu-ray copy. It's totally worth every penny!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you should see for yourself and get it. I got it and I love it.I love it so much that I wrote this review you should tottally get ut plause its free.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|I could only get through about 40 minutes of this movie before finally turning it off. The language didn't bother me, although it does become tiresome. However, it was very boring and dumb. I didn't see much comedy in it at all. I rented it via Amazon's VOD for 99¢, so at least it was cheap. That said, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie even if it was free.
1400052173|5.0|I had actually known the basic outlines of the HeLa story for years: the discovery of a strange, aggressive form of cervical cancer in a young and healthy black woman in segregated 1950s Virginia, the inability to treat her case, and the research built from her cells after she died -- tough and practically immortal, and a major part of biological research in the years since (to the point of HeLa actually becoming a weed in some other cell cultures). But Rebecca Skloot went to find out the family's side of the story, and in the process created a new classic. Skloot puts a different spin on it; she crosses the line of becoming the story and in the process tells the story of a family swept along by history, proud of Lacks' contribution to science but justifiably angry at the fact that it took them twenty years to find out about the bits of Henrietta that remained alive. Skloot is in general an excellent writer with a strong sense of the personal; although her Mark Twain-esques attempt to represent the Lacks family's AAVE dialect seem strange and jarring, her ups and downs (mostly ups) as she gets to know the family play a part in the story as well, but not so much as to distract from the facts.<br /><br />Overall, this story is justly a classic, both of science writing and biography of a family that has gone through the years with no control over the memory of their mother, whose life contributed one of the greatest discoveries in medical history. Skloot does an excellent job of capturing it, and this book has justly earned all the interest it's recieved since it came out.
B005FITIK0|2.0|A major disappointment.<br /><br />I loved the film Juno by Diablo Cody and looked forward to being entertained after reading all of the great reviews for this film, but once again, you simply can't trust the critics reviews.<br /><br />Theron is good in whatever role she plays and this is no exception, but the story is bleak and pathetic and I found very little humor in the story.  The encounter in checking into the hotel was the only moment where I actually laughed.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Written at a time when the author was living a very strained time in his life, this novel is a thinly vieled expose on what life was really like in the diplomatic corps during the cold war.  Although the author was not scaling the wall himself it does not take much imagination to see that these charcters are based on real people.  How real the events are we will never know.  If you are after a gripping read that grabbed the worlds attention when written and still holds us in the palm of the writers hand from the first word to the last you will love this sensational work.
B000OJFV3S|3.0|I found The Tudors Season 1 somewhat addictive.  The costumes and sets are attractive.  I know I am in the minority in not being impressed by the acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  However, I am quite impressed by his body, which is frequently on view along with the very attractive bodies of several other cast members.<br /><br />Please be aware that The Tudors is a long way from historically accurate.  Other than the fact that Henry had six wives, do not believe anything else.  Events follow a dramatic, not historic, timeline; characters are not accurately drawn (especially Margaret).  The most ridiculous example of 'dramatic license' is having a Roman Catholic cardinal commit suicide!<br /><br />Ignoring the inaccuracies, the show is sexy and mildly addictive.  If you are in the mood for a soap, go for it!
B000OVLIQU|5.0|I really like this book. It gives a nice picture of the music creation process, from start to finish, in the golden Beatles years. It has a lot of curiosities as well, and its absolutely worth reading. You'll be constantly playing the songs in order to hear the details Geoff talks about, even some mistakes and creative recording techniques employed.
B005CMGKTG|4.0|The DVD came in a slim box without any liner notes.  The artwork on the DVD itself was good.<br />The movie is all in Japanese with English subtitles.  The picture was generally clean and had proper audio sync.<br />The only negative things I can say about the DVD is that there were 5 points during the movie in which the image because momentarily distorted.  Not the whole picture, though.  Just a part of the screen.  Replaying this part on another player produced the same errors.<br />The subtitling was good except for two places.  The first is during a dialog in which \\"...you're...\\" was written as \\"...youAEre...\\".  The second was far more serious.  At the end of the movie during the big climactic moment (when no words are being spoken) this subtitle appears...\\"CHINESE SUBTITLES BY HALF-X\\"<br />I'm guessing this DVD release was not originally intended and was more of an afterthought (feeling more like a high quality bootleg than a real effort by the studio).<br />There are no special features offered.<br />I give this 4 stars because the movie itself is really good.  For those who are SB Yamato/Star Blazers fans, the story is essenctially the first season rammed into 2 hours.  The Gamilas (Gamalons) are depicted quite differently than in the shows.  And unlike the shows, people actually die in this movie (albeit heroicly).  The special effects were quite good as well.  The Black Tiger fighters have a different appearence as well.  Although they look like really high-tech fighters, they have additional functionality I'll leave the viewer to discover for her/himself.<br />The soundtrack was also good.  Much of the music is new arrangements of the classic soundtrack, with some new stuff written in as well.<br />Bottom line is...if you're a SB Yamato/Star Blazers fan, this is definately worth adding to your collection, even with the quality issues mentioned above.

0385342063|4.0|I pick up Sophie Kinsella's books when my brain is feeling fried or I have had a hard week and just need a light, breezy, girlie, non-taxing escape. This is what she writes, and if it's what you are looking for, this book will do the trick. The main character Poppy is engaged, and while at a party in the first chapter, manages to lose her engagement ring and her phone, and then find another phone in a bin, which she decides to temporarily use. These events kick off all sorts of other events that form the basis for the story, quite a bit of which plays out in text messages. There are of course romantic complications, as well as a bit of corporate intrigue. Poppy is kind-hearted but naive, and gets herself into all kinds of ridiculous situations.<br /><br />Reading Kinsella's books requires a complete suspension of disbelief, because so often the humor relies on misunderstandings and coincidences that in real-life would never happen, or would be cleared up with a simple conversation. So you have to not get frustrated with this, and just go with it, kind of like TV sit-coms. I did find myself frustrated with Poppy at times, and with the use of footnotes in this book (which have a theme), but the latter issue may just have been because my digital reader was slow to jump back and forth between the footnotes and the text, and that may not be a problem for everyone.<br /><br />So overall, fun, light, classic Kinsella.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I've been waiting to get a good, affordable, good quality and easy to use steady cam, so far the Opteka SteadyVid pro is the best after months of research, is similar to the Steadicam Merlin but definitely for this price the Opteka is a better option...  and i am glad to purchase this one as my first stabilizer.

B005RDF2RG|5.0|I still remember the first time I saw this. It made my six-year-old self actually sit still for an hour and a half.<br />I think the first reason was the characters. The title character, played by Mike Myers, is funny and although he is not a nice person at the beginning (being a stereotypical ogre), everyone likes him. A scene in the middle of the movie makes us feel sorry for him, in fact. \\"People take one look at me and go 'Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre.' They judge me before they even know me.\\"<br />Later, the line about judging is echoed back to Shrek by the film's female lead, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Although she begins as a typical fairytale princess, she proves independent, fearless and skilled. She turns out to be the perfect match for Shrek.<br />The villain, the dwarf Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is also very funny. He's snobby, superficial, and overall just cruel.<br />But I think the credit should really go to Eddie Murphy, who plays the role of Shrek's sidekick, Donkey. He was probably the first person to befriend Shrek, who at first finds him annoying, but becomes quite friendly with him. Nearly every joke makes me laugh every time, especially when Donkey freaks out because Shrek got shot by an arrow. \\"Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt?! Oh no, Shrek's gonna die!\\"<br />The jokes, as I said, are hilarious, and the storyline is perfect. It's a parody of a fairytale, and works extremely well. Out of the four Shrek movies, this is probably the second best, close behind the second movie. I strongly advise you to buy it.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I've got a pretty big head and most headsets hurt my ears or give me a headache.  This one has great sound quality (I'm not an audiophile but I love my music to be clear and crisp) and can sit comfortably for hours.<br />That being said, it's huge.  If you have a small head, you'll look really confusing.

0553801473|3.0|I waited how long for A Dance With Dragons?<br /><br />It is not poorly written and there are some very good moments in the novel, but it is ultimately filler. Perhaps these pages will be meaningful come book six, but from where we as readers came A Dance With Dragons is tough to appreciate.

0439023513|5.0|*spoiler alert* I guess this contains some minor spoilers so, if you haven't read the book, don't read this, or proceed with caution.<br /><br />When I first read Mockingjay, and closed it after the last page, I knew one thing for sure: I loved it. Though it made me feel empty and drained and shattered inside, I loved it so much I almost wanted to say it was my favorite of the three. Needless to say I was almost shell shocked to find such a backlash toward it among readers. I just couldn't understand where they were coming from! They didn't like the choices of characters she killed off, it felt rushed, Katniss wasn't the same, Why Prim? what happened to Gale? I was so confused, because all of these questions and concerns had answers in my mind, answers that made perfect sense.<br /><br />One of the huge problems I've seen that people have with how this book played out, is they feel there isn't enough time to process the deaths. They just happen, and well, that's it. They were upset that they didn't have time to mourn with Katniss, and that there weren't paragraphs dedicated to each of them. All I could think was: this is a war they're fighting. In war, you don't have time to lock yourself away for months to mourn the death of your comrades. All the sacrifices her fellow friends and soldiers made were not in vane. They were made so she could continue on and change the world. They too had loved ones living in this world, they sacrificed for them as well. Katniss lives the rest of her life with the weight and the guilt of their deaths. If the rest of your life isn't enough time to come to terms and mourn, well, I don't know what to tell you.<br /><br />As for it being sloppy and rushed, I didn't feel that at all. The quickness of it helped me realize the urgency of their mission. Katniss had taken over a part of the army and was leading her own mini rebellion. She was unorganized, and had to move, think, and act very quickly, or else the entire plan fall apart.<br /><br />And as for Katniss not being our same fiery Katniss, I can more than understand that too. She had seen and been responsible for countless deaths. Faces she'd never seen. The first arena alone haunted and changed her. A full blown war, with her at the center? It's a miracle she didn't implode. She watched all those she loved twisted and changed before her eyes. Gale was becoming a war monster, his rebellious streak growing and taking over. Prim was older, more independent, less afraid. She was facing a terrible world and doing it without Katniss. Peeta was turned into a ghost of himself, and she couldn't bear losing her \\"boy with the bread.\\" Katniss had been deeply affected and hurt by all that her world had done to her, and all she had done to others. She was realizing she was little more than a pawn to both sides, and that shook her.<br /><br />I think given the circumstances, this book ends very happily, and there are very very few loose ends, if any! I have yet to find any, except maybe what happened to Joanna Mason. She goes back to her life and she moves on. She never forgets the people who died. Peeta returns. The friendship between Katniss and Gale had long been severed, the incident with Prim was just the final blow. It was a small one, there was no real evidence as to whether he had anything to do with it, but it was enough. Katniss grows up, has children of her own, and learns to live and love again. I had no problems thinking it was a beautiful ending for a fractured girl and boy in a broken world. They were safe now, that was the goal all along. They'd finally kept each other safe.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|I was stunned to discover that the film \\"Sarah's Key\\" is much better than the book it is based on. While I found the book to be pretty contrived most of the time, the film is well-acted, engaging, and not too over-the-top. Kristin Scott Thomas is an amazing actress, and she delivers an outstanding performance in this film, which is rounded out by a very strong supporting cast. There are a few moments in the film that I thought could have been better, but overall I quite enjoyed it...much more than I enjoyed the book.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Good book. I was soi angry with parts of the book and ashamed that this sort of double standard behavior occured!
0061474355|5.0|I found this book at my town's public library just after reading one if Garth Nix's short stories ( In \\"The Dragon Book\\"). From reading that short story I knew how creepy his stories could be. Trust me, this book was put in the young adult section for a reason. I am not saying it is a bad story, it is one of the best I have read, but it could give almost anyone nightmares. Take it from a 13 year old reader This is NOT a book for anyone who doesn't like books with: violence, magic, the undead, death ( they visit quite a few times....... the Nine Gates), or \\"bad\\" language.<br /><br />  Story(at least to get you going)<br />  Sabriel is a 16 year old girl(as of the first chapter, not the prologue)that attends a school in the non-magical town of Ancelstierre. One day she finds her father's( who is the current Abhorsen)bells and sword. She then decides to go to the old kingdom and try and find him. Along the way she meets a few interesting characters, Mogget the white cat( or is he only a cat) and a mysterious person who calls himself Touchstone. This story is like none I have ever read before an amazing story....... and I usually hate the undead........

B005J6LKVI|5.0|I loved this film.  Not only for the comedy and acting that these women gave us but for what the film says.  I think it's an important film to have those who were not around in the 60's  watch.  Like many era's in our history, it cannot be denied that these things happened.

B0052RDHTM|1.0|It has become prohibitive for Canadians to buy kindle books.  It is cheaper to buy the hard copy and have it shipped than it is to buy a digital kindle book. This situation is os ridiculous and renders the purchase of a Kindle for Canadians a complete waste of money. Mine will know be \\"shelved\\" and books bought for other readers.  Can't afford to pay up to ten dollars more for a kindle digital book, the Kindle  3G at well over $200 for Canadians was a hard lesson to learn. Switch and bait at its worse.  Way not to go Amazon!
B006SV2LWA|3.0|I didn't really like any of the characters in this movie, but the story was interesting and well told. What would happen if an outbreak of what turns out to be some kind of bat-pig flu begins to destroy life on Earth? Because it's so realistic, it's easy for all the characters to run together. They're all SO CONCERNED about everything. Okay. Got it. Snore. The one interesting character was the doctor who decides to try the vaccine on herself. I would've liked this one better with zombies.
B003S897P0|5.0|Not a huge Crowes fan, but they always caught my ear. Felt they were trying to find an honest direction, but we're always missing something. Sorry lovers of the band, but despite the fact they had some great songs and we're close, but in many ways they seemed to be trying to hard to be an American version of the Stones or Zepplin, in my mind.<br />Having someone suggest getting their last album, which some critics talked about their move toward a more Americana sound like the band, I was intrigued. Bought that CD and really liked it; the arrangements were very solid, but the songs not quite up to the same level of their playing. What really intriqued me though was the change to allowing the band to stretch out and explore some very interesting instrumental improvising that really highlighted their attempt to try less radio like songs and a more music centric style.<br />The Crowology CD's take that focal and apply it to their past catalog with incredible adaptation. Upon first listen and every one since, I am simply blown away. If you love great musicianship, you are in for a real treat. Fittingly, they have shut it down, for a leave, just as they have hit a new incredible stride. I'm sure (only guessing of course) this break will get them geared up to take stock of what potential this new direction will allow them to explore and return with a stock of songs that are equal to their new musical direction they have discovered. Fingers crossed and can't wait.
B0036T31YY|4.0|I LOVED Christopher Smith's \\"Severance.\\" It's funny, it's surprising, the twists are ALMOST great (the reveal is kind of silly), but it was better than it might've been. With that in mind, I was really looking forward to \\"Triangle.\\" \\"Triangle\\" starts off fairly normal like any American teen horror movie with stranded kids forced onto an abandoned ocean liner. But very early, there is a twist that you don't see coming with the Jess-character played amazingly well by Melissa George. To say much more about the movie would rob you of the surprise but needless to say, it becomes a film where you have to pay careful attention to what's happening as it goes from \\"Friday the 13th\\" to David Fincher's \\"The Game\\" or something pretty quickly. My only complaint is that after you figure out what's happening, the pay-off isn't THAT great. Still, it's better than most other horror movies out there, so check it out.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I hadn't even heard of these books before the TV show came on, but it's the best thing I've ever seen on television. The performances are amazing, the sets and locations are lavish and beautiful, and the story, which should be complicated and unwieldy, is told so well that I just wanted more, more, MORE! I could cheat and read the books as I'm really dying to know what happens next, but I don't know if that would just mess up stuff like the Ned-reveal in the second-to-last episode or what was to happen with Dany and Khal Drogo or even how the fate of Robert would affect everything midway through (I am still suspicious of his \\"accident!\\"). So, there are two sides. The side of me that wants to read the books knowing that there is probably a lot more story in them with richer character descriptions and plot that had to be cut out for television. Then, there's the other side that LOVED seeing it filmed and wants to be surprised. I just don't know. It's such a perfect TV show that if the book isn't AS perfect, I'd feel let down.<br /><br />Anyway, big five stars for \\"Game of Thrones.\\" Best show I've ever, ever seen. Even better than, I'll say it, \\"Firefly.\\"
B006ZCWTV0|5.0|Finally America has a song worthy of being it's national anthem...  Thanks Bruce for giving us a \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\"!
B0062P332Y|2.0|Once you decipher the story of \\"Killer Elite,\\" you realize that it's so, so interesting and good. A better story than the \\"Bourne Idnetity\\" or James Bond movies. To save his friend, a hard-ass mercenary has to revisit the bad deeds of a group of British commandos and set things right. Against him is an equally tough commando who wants to stop him. For much of the movie, both men see each other as the bad guy, which gives them great motivation to win. Jason Statham is always great when he has a good story and Clive Owen should be awesome here, too. But, the story is told with cliche after cliche and the directing is so bad that you wish you'd just read the book. The opening scene with De Niro is the best I've seen him in since \\"Ronin,\\" though, and I thought it would be the big De Niro tough guy comeback. Then, he just whines the rest of the movie.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Christmas Story is a wonderful family movie that takes you to lands far away! Some beautiful snow scenes to be seen!  Take the time to step away from the commercialism of Christmas and sit down with this heartwarming film!  It's one to watch each Christmas season! The entire family loved it!
B007BLDFWG|5.0|This is SUCH a good movie. It's scary and gets under your skin, but it's never an overt horror film. Instead, it's a carefully laid out story that takes place in two threads. One of them is a flashback which tells the story of how Martha got involved with a low-rent agrarian hippie commune and the other is present day following her after her escape. This works very well because for the first half, you see that her life with the commune had really horrific sides to it. But then in \\"the real world,\\" you see that there are aspects of her commune life that, horrors aside, Martha prefers to life with her sister and husband. I thought for a time that the movie might be about why she decided to go back to the commune as the cult-life was so seductive. Then, the movie takes a dark turn and you understand why she left. The title itself is a mystery as it doesn't make sense all the different names. By the time you understand the title, you can't imagine the movie called anything else. The film is very, very tense and interesting.
B0057GYOA4|1.0|I love loud and noisy music.  I love Nirvana - all of their albums, including Nevermind.  But seriously, they boosted the volume so much on this remaster (and compressed the dynamic range - quiet parts are not quiet AT ALL) that it's taxing to listen to this version.  I'm about 95% sure that they pushed it so high that there is distortion that was never in the original recordings.<br /><br />You might be thinking \\"this is grunge, it's supposed to be loud\\" - that's what I thought when I saw the early reviews.  Seriously, it sounds like crap this way, it's ridiculous.  The only redeeming quality about this is the newly released material.  (It still doesn't sound great but some of it I had never heard before.)  Overall I say find an original Nevermind used and buy \\"Incesticide\\" if you haven't heard it and revel in the glory that is Nirvana - because this remaster really doesn't do them justice.
0439023513|2.0|***SPOILERS***<br />Before I started this review, I read some of the 4 and 5 star reviews for this book. I understand the fact that sometimes it is refreshing to have a story that doesn't end with \\"Happily Ever After\\". I also get that this story is about war and all the terrible atrocities that accompanies it. However, with every good story, the ending should at least give the readers a sense of satisfaction about the characters. This book falls way short in doing so.<br /><br />This is the finale of the series, and since the story is told through the eyes of Katniss, you would expect to see her character development grow stronger. She has survived 2 Hunger Games, endured the agony of losing loved ones due to her actions, witnessed the true greed and oppressive power of the Capitol, and constantly being manipulated by everyone around her. Yet, Katniss remains the same, childlike girl we met in The Hunger Games. Throughout the story, she is constantly doubting  herself, feeling guilty about how others have sacrificed so much for her, and pretty much not taking a firm stance in anything. She was so determined to not be a pawn to the Capitol, yet in the final book, she very easily gives into being a pawn for District 13's propaganda.<br /><br />Another negative issue for this story was that the ending seemed WAY too rushed! So many important issues are being glossed over, such as the death of Prim, Gale's possible hand in the bomb, Peeta's recovery to sanity, the fate of Panem, just to mention a few. Instead of writing a few paragraphs discussing these issues, Collins basically just glosses over them with a sentence or two. Like \\"Gale now has a fancy job in District 2\\". \\"Peeta suddenly became sane again and is living in District 12\\". The rushed ending with the lack of tying up loose ends really gave me the impression that Collins wanted to be done with this story and sent to press.<br /><br />Although the ending was dismal, I don't think that is what upsets most readers. We were expecting to discover a Katniss who has grown stronger through her experiences. Instead, we got a very unlikable Katniss who has learned nothing. I honestly felt a bit robbed after reading the last line, as I felt this series had so much more potential to being great.

0307957934|2.0|Most of the reviews here focus on Harris' 21st century take on HAL and the lack of appealing characters (other than perhaps LeClerq). As for the AI computer run amok trope, yes it has been done a million times before and better. On the other hand, the rather unsympathetic characters were definitely by design. I think Harris' problem was trying to reconcile the requirements of a potboiler with the desire to reproach the financial services industry and explore the negative effect it has had on science and the overall economy in recent decades. Hoffman is a symbol more than a character, representative of the underfunding of science (particularly stateside) and the brain drain that financial services has brought to the scientific community as opportunity and easy money attract the best and brightest away from scientific endeavor and towards the self-serving arena of high finance. He also represents the pursuit of a personal goal (in his case, AI) regardless of its impact on other people. He is a cipher who seems to lack empathy. Quarry represents the self-absorbed, shallow, if not a bit sociopathological side of the business world, totally willing to keep the system going as long as it benefits him and with no regard to the danger it poses to others. The third indictment is of course, aimed at the high-speed computer trading schemes that create unfair advantages to the traders that employ them, as well as how a significant percentage of the finance industry no longer serves a broader purpose in the economy and has simply become a parasite.<br /><br />All valid and timely points, but I think Harris' attempt to execute a suspenseful, sci-fi lite thriller around these criticisms ultimately fails because there is a lack of human connection and a plot resolution that is too obvious early on. With enough real-world examples of malfeasance to call upon, these themes are perhaps more easily explored via nonfiction.

0061537969|5.0|This is a great book! I love it. This book can and will help you get closer to you pet. Even if you're not a pet owner you too will fall in love it. It's a great gift to give. My friends and family members all love it as well.

B0052ZQMLO|1.0|The fact that this dictionary, the one that seems like a good one, doesn't work on Kindle Fire is really disappointing. I wasn't even asking for a German-Portuguese (my native language) Dictionary. All I expected was some kind of tool to help me out with my german... which I didn't find.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was curious to read this  book after i heard about it from someone who read about it in a newspaper. I understand that this is some kind of adult version of the twilight story, only the vampire is a Bdsm businessman. Already a sign that this book is not going to be promising,  i decided to read it since it was about my favorite kind of playtime: bdsm. While I think the premise is hot, the delivery falls very short. I was forcing myself to read it because I spent money on it. Halfway through I just skimmed and couldn't find myself getting juicy at all. Which really, really sucks. I won't spoil the details for anyone but in my own opinion, the novel is unoriginal, narrated very poorly and the leading lady of this  dom/sub saga seems  very unrelateable. I just don't see why it is necessary to write from the perspective of a very typical uninteresting 21 year old girl who narrates the story like a 13 year old. If she was a literature major who love british novels of the 19th century, she doesn't seem to fit the profile with her dim witted valley girl drivel. I feel like the author is playing it safe with her characters and this lacks, not packs heat in this soggy, unsteamy story of  submission and domination. If you want to submit to the torture of 'why did I spend money on this?' then please, buy it now. Otherwise, you would be advised to spend your dollars on a copy of Mary Gaitskills 'Bad Behavior'. For those who have seen the film, The Secretary, the short story of which the film is based on, is in Bad Behavior. Also, this bdsm themed story and movie is more interesting and makes Fifty Shades of Waste your time seem so....vanilla.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is multiple games in one and is amazingly addictive. I'll sit for hours playing these games and never get bored.

038572179X|4.0|I think this dazzling novel delves into the process of literary creation. In the begining was the blank page syndrome. Briony waiting in the bridge \\"calm and obstinate\\" like a creator or at least one who seriously wants to be such, before a blank page, wishing \\"real events, not her fantasies\\", that is realistic stories, not childish ones, which would dispell her insignificance, in her longing (craving?) for transcendency, until something appears; a gesture, an image, something which enlightens her imagination toward the unveiling, discovering of reality. It is not a paradox. Always is necesary a lot of imagination. The rest is atonement. That is the price every creator must pay in the long time.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|After running for seven years and watching how easily my fellow runners checked their distance, time and pace, I finally spent the money for a Garmin GPS Sport Watch.  I looked at the features of every model and settled on the 405CX because it had all of the features I wanted except touch screen, which was too expensive for me.  Amazon had a great price and that sealed the deal for me.  It takes a little while to learn how to take advantage of everything, but it's working fine.  I have not tried the heart monitor and I would love to have larger numbers, but for the money it's a great sport watch.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a keeper and will probably become a classic. I was moved by this trilogy,love overcoming all obstacles.  I enjoyed Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" the \\"oh my's\\" and the emails between Ana and Christian.  I laughed and cried and could not put the books down.<br /><br />To the one star reviewers I say, make sure you read all of the reviews before you purchase a book.  I'll bet you bought it because of \\"the sex scenes\\" and read it in private.  Oh my.<br /><br />ITS A LOVE STORY PEOPLE..READ IT.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This was far better than I expected from the reviews and trailers. It is a movie you can watch over and over finding nuances with each viewing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical about reading The Hunger Games because of all the press it has gotten, but eventually I gave in and am I glad I did. After reading the first page I was sucked into the world of Katniss and I read this book in under a day. Amazing and I'm buying the next one right when Im done with this review!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love all of these games because they are just so fun to play in my free time and its just great.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have only had this a few days but so far it has worked great. I am a person who will hit snooze or dismiss and go back to sleep usually, not with the math feature on this app. I have it set to 5 problems of medium difficulty which is adding and subtracting larger numbers (hundreds). I cant get my brain to settle after that. although i will admit to almost throwing my kindle this morning after it took 20 min. to complete a problem. it gently wakes you up not startle you so that is a major plus. the only downside i have seen so far is when the alarms are set on my kindle it keeps a warning up that something is running at all times, kinda annoying but easily overlooked.
1451683405|5.0|I cannot recommend this book too highly. It is succinct (65 pages plus excellent notes), clear, witty, and comprehensive. Recent neurological findings are discussed, as well as the possible relevance of quantum theory to the age-old question. Compatibility arguments, such as those of Dennett and Tom Clark, are given their day in court, and differing opinions are quoted at length. All aspects of the problem, from the unconscious sources of our will to the moral and judicial implications of seeing the compound illusions of free agency, are treated in a manner that is the polar opposite of philosophical obfuscation and/or veiled wish-fulfillment. The result, for this reader, is a breath of fresh air and, perhaps paradoxically, a sense of great liberation.<br /><br />In a country that has more prisoners per capita than any other and where many of its citizens would much prefer to \\"beat Basil's car\\" beyond recognition rather than give it an oil change (see Dawkins and \\"Fawlty Towers\\"), it is refreshing to find someone with the courage both to uphold compassion and to suggest pragmatic and reasoned approaches to criminal behavior based on sound scientific knowledge. Bravo, Sam Harris!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I didnt think this game would be very fun because of the hype but it blew all my thoughts away. I love this game its difficult in some places and extremely easy in others. there is lots of content.
B00000JCB2|2.0|Significant Other got some ok songs like NOOKIE, REARRANGED, JUST LIKE THIS and TRUST...But is really hard to handle with Fred Durst...They got some good rhymes, but most of what he sings is sooooo stupid! The musicians of Limp Bizkit are not bad, but Fred talks too much and say a lot of crap!
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I'm not sure what I think, but my husband is head over heels for this DVD concert. He set up our entire sound system in the living room - creating a Bermuda Triangle with him and the speakers - in order to maximize the sound authenticity for maximun enjoyment. He just loves this DVD and Rush. He says, \\"THOSE GUYS HAVE STILL GOT IT. BIG TIME.\\" What a geek. :)
B0050LJIRK|2.0|Gold Cobra is not so bad as i thought it could be...I mean, many years passed since the Limp Bizkit high spotted time...After Chocolate Starfish they totally lost their way....Gold Cobra got some good tracks like BRINGING BACK, SHOTGUN and SHARK ATTACK...Fred's vocals are less stupid than ever, but still some lyrics are totally embarassing....I don't know, but this white rapper who catches all the chicks style is sooooo ridiculous...This rap crap destroyed Limp Bizkit...If they recorded more Heavy metal albuns like 3 dollar bill yall, they could have been much better....
B0060AY6FO|1.0|Gimmicky, trite, shallow, boring, tedious, and stuffed with verbal fluff. Mystery? What mystery? Have I left any insult to literature out? Because I don't mean to. P.D. James, once a fairly decent writer, has succumbed to the narcissism that frequently accompanies great success. She imagines she can emulate Jane Austen of the wicked tongue in cheek, the master of characters with facets, and a riveting story teller. This isn't a story. It's a parade of outfits and smooching husbands and wives--unending cesspools of sickly sweet (but restrained) banality, a husband and fawning spouse sucking us toward nausea. The spark of Austen's characters--gone. In their place, these insipid prigs. I hated this book. If there were any justice in the world, it would be burned instead of draping its vapid contents all over the best seller list. Ugh.
B000001Y42|3.0|This is by far the best album by Limp Bizkit....Fred Durst got less rap lyrics and uses more gutural screams, which i think is way better than the white rapper style he incorporates in the future records...There's some songs that i REALLY don't care, but also the greatest ones by LB like COUNTERFEIT, POLLUTION, NOBODY LOVES ME and STUCK!!!
B005I6EU48|5.0|Ole lady loved it and said it was the coolest case for a pad that she had seen.  Take that reaction as you will, seeing it was a gift from her husband, but I kinda thought it was fly as well.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Chocolate Starfish turn Limp Bizkit in one of the most famous bands in 2000... This was the end for Limp Bizkit... Fred Durst lyrics sometimes provides some interesting stuff, but most of what he sing is total crap! Ok, ALL THE RAPPERS got some lame and mediocre lyrics, so Fred's rap style obviously will provide bad rhymes... this last breath from Limp Bizkit got some good songs like MY GENERATION, LIVIN IT UP, MY WAY and the best limp song, the duet with Scott Weiland HOLD ON...BYE BYE FRED...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love the game.  Not to hard not to easy.  Just tons of fun...,.....<br /><br />now I can't wait for a sequel.
B00007E8V4|5.0|STEAL THIS ALBUM is another great metal album from SYSTEM OF A DOWN...SYSTEM is a great metal act with a unique way to deliver heavy songs...CHIC N'STU, NUGUNS, MR.JACK , INNERVISION, ADD,  IEAIAIO , EGO BRAIN, THETAWAVES and STREAMLINE are among the best stuff they did!!! this is a great compilation of heavy songs...if you like the SYSTEM sound you will like STEAL THIS ALBUM!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|No less than the greatest piece of musical theater ever created.<br />I have seen a few of the live performances way back when, and absolutely<br />loved the movie.  But this had me practically in tears almost all the way<br />through -- it was that astonishingly wondrous.  How can I say I loved it?<br />And wish I could well be able to be near a large theater that would run it<br />again on the big screen.  No, it is NOT the show I originally saw, and has<br />been changed around, expanded on, and \\"deepened.\\"  Yet it is no less, and<br />even greater: a true masterpiece.  (With the only flaw being the absence of the<br />crashing chandelier at the end of Act One... here, very weakly simulated.  But<br />I understand they did their best anyway.)
B000BMSTMS|2.0|See you on the other side got some good songs like Politics, Hypocrites and Twisted Transistor...But the other songs seems sooooo uninspired...Jonathan Davis become another singer, and the old Jon is way more angry and creative...Jon seems tired and uninspired, but it´s the way music goes...All the bands got high moments and than disappear... I think is time to Korn to retire and enjoy past great records like KORN´s debut and LIFE IS PEACHY...
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I cant stop playing this game. This game looks great on the kindel fire and the upgrade combinations keep it interesting.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Investment banking firm discovers after office hours that they are in deep trouble and that it is far too late to avoid the shipwreck. An urgently convened night session of the top crew decides to go all out and dump all assets in a day. Most jobs will be gone, but many people will have earned lovely bonuses. The skipper earns his pay either way, win or lose.<br />Strong cast: Jeremy Irons in one of his best performances since long gives a masterful taipan. Stanley Tucci, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey, Paul Bettany, Simon Baker as members of the management with different fates. Gamblers, nerds, confidence men, adventurers, killers turned victim... Brilliant.<br />Among the subjects which have been discussed lately in connection with the degeneration of the global industrial strength of the US is a trend that the finance 'industry' apparently has attracted engineering talents away from production towards financial 'engineering'. The plot picks up on this subject by letting two former engineers discover the problem. One had formerly built bridges, the other studied propulsion engineering. You mean you are a rocket scientist?<br />This is not quite Wall Street 3, but close.
0553381695|1.0|Wow. All I can say about this series is I am completely disappointed. This was horrible! I've read a lot of fantasy and scifi, I read about one book every 2 weeks to give you an idea. This is one of the worse series I have read. Everyone I have talked to, raves about this series, which leads me to think that they do not know what good writing should be. I started out hopeful, and was waiting to find that moment where you become entranced in the story, where you find characters you love or love to hate. I kept waiting, and waiting; I waited through about 3500 pages. Petty, selfish, stupid, annoyingly short-sighted or bland; pick any of these words and that describes 99% of the characters in this story. Any half-way likable characters were killed off randomly, abruptly serving no actual purpose (but not after he goes into their childhood woes for pages and pages). In all five books there was a grand total of one dynamic character. There were also so many characters, that even in five books; the author could not make any of them more than two dimensional placeholders. I have seen children's cartoons with more character development. Plot what plot? `People fighting for one throne,' great start what else? Nothing, that's it. World building? Terrible. I thought the seasons lasting for different lengths of time was clever, however there is no way any of the civilizations could actually survive in the world he placed them in. It was like he did not think through what he wanted and spewed up random ideas all over the pages without any follow through. When he couldn't figure out what to do he just killed off the plotline or character. The entire of magic construct in this book is flimsy at best, and may or may not be based on dragons. I'm not sure he has completely decided yet. You want a good series? The way of Kings, Wheel of Time, or the kingkiller chronicles.

B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones are easily the best headphones I have ever had, they do a pretty fair of cancelling out the noise and if you have some music going on then they are even better for noise cancelling! The also have a button to mute you mic that turns on a visible(when the headphones are being worn) red light that will turn on to remind you it is muted.<br /> The software comes with some pretty cool stuff too, voice changers and other settings. The wireless function on these are incredible, I live in a multistory house and am able to go all the way down to the lower levels and still have the audio/mic work flawlessly! Seem to be very sturdy build quality, I would easily buy this product again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of challenges but I going to beat them all.  I like the many different games and ways to play them.

B0071QIN00|2.0|Whereas TrialsHD on the 360 plays like a dream this game plays like a nightmare.  in the rare instance when it works (ie the accelerator doesn't stop working and other minor control issues) than its okay.  But typically the dev expects you to have an amount of control that's just not available to you which makes for a frustrating expierience.
1569242739|5.0|I just made the green tea cupcakes and they are worth the price of the book alone! Tastes like a Starbucks green tea frappuccino. I cannot tell you how delightful they are. The chefs at Vegan Cupcakes really did their research. The recipes are precise and perfect. I'm not even a full fledged vegan and I think anyone, regardless if they are vegan or not, would benefit from this book. Good ingredients = good cupcakes. The recipes they have are very creative, which they back up with beautiful photos. They even tell you where to purchase hard to find items online. I also am impressed how they thought of every need and offer gluten-free recipes, with or without soy, etc. Like I mentioned they did an excellent job in proofing these recipes and they are no fail...the ones I've made at least which include coconut lime, green tea and soon-to-be margarita cupcakes. This is a must-have book to have on your shelf. I am so happy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was ok but some of the games are extremely hard. I do wish it was a little bit easier to earn points.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I found this excellent and detailed account very satisfying emotionally on two grounds.<br /><br />It is rooted in current epoch and the people and events described were lived through by many of us. A worthwhile trip down memory lane.<br /><br />It restores- in full measure - my faith and optimism about USA. American genius at its innovative best is alive and thriving.<br />Steve Jobs, warts and imperfections notwithstanding,is a great genius no less than Edison Franklin and Einstein.<br /><br />It is also an easy read and a lucid and engaging account.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|My husband and I hadn't seen this movie in forever! So when we got it in the mail we watched it. Classic movie. Would recommend.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie really hits home for a lot of people. I personally am a Christian; but even non-christians should watch this movie because it is a great movie. I have grown up from a single parent home. I wanted my dad badly and father's really do need to understand their role and responsibility. Father's are necessary in a child's life the way God had intended for things to be. I loved this movie because of the beauty of it. I related to it in all aspects (I cannot go in to such detail or this review will be very long). After watching this movie,it encouraged me to keep my vow. I want to do things right, and my children will have a father because I choose marriage first before having children; and their father would be a great father because he will love the Lord. I saw the movie at my church and immediately ordered this for my movie collection.
1400069289|5.0|In this book we learn not only how habits shape our lives, but how habits themselves are created and maintained.  There are tips on how to change unwanted habits and accounts of how corporations use knowledge of customer's habits.  The discussion of the anatomy of cravings was particularly fascinating to me.  There were many interesting anecdotes to fortify and illustrate the author's points.  But the book seems solidly based on scientific studies as well.<br /><br />It is clear that habits can uplift or undermine a human being or an organization.  The tale the author recounts of casinos drawing a habitual gambler on to destruction was truly chilling.  Do we want corporations to know as much about our habitual behaviors as, according to this book, they now do?  Probably not, and if they use the knowledge to send us coupons for Pampers just at the right time, that's one thing, but what if they target the vulnerable and entice them to act in a self-destructive way?<br /><br />All in all, this is a fascinating and enlightening book
B006ON41FC|4.0|Fun (sometimes frustrating) game, but the Open Feint and &quot;Review Me!&quot; reminders are obnoxiously invasive. I thought this game would have multiple levels, but apparently you just start at the beginning of the same old level each time. Before (finally) disabling stupid Open Feint, the game play was so jerky and glitchy that I was constantly crashing into trees. The &quot;depth perception&quot; could be a lot tighter (it's hard to tell whether you're going to crash...until you do). It would also be nice to have the ability to calibrate steering. Sound should have been easier to disable as well. Droid 3
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It ia beautifully written and the author breathes life into her characters! This novel has all the elememts that make up a great novel.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read all types of romance including erotica.  This book has it all!  Wonderful story and you can't put it down.  You get sucked in from page 1 and can't wait to see what happens next.  You fall in love with the characters.  I intend to read all three books and have purchased on my kindle. Looking forward to E L James next book.  Please write more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book about a year ago on my Kindle and I must say I was hooked right from the beginning.  So much action, so much craziness, so addicting!  The characters are amazing.  So much to anticipate! I HIGHLY recommend this book as well as the 2nd book in the series, which I am reading now. This book was so engaging that I felt I was right in the arena with Peeta and Katniss!  I LOVED IT!  Please get this book!

B005KMX866|4.0|Gave this to my husband, a true CI fan. He liked it because of the new takes on old favorites - but he still prefers Chris Issak's original material.
0553582038|4.0|Of the Song of Ice and Fire series, this is perhaps one of the least loved, if the reader reviews I've seen are anything to go by.  And yet, the average rating puts it around 3-4 stars depending on which website you're looking at.  And most people seem to not like the fact that half of the characters of the series are missing or that Brienne's tale seems to linger on a while to no seeming purpose.  But, after giving some thought to how I would've organize this book if I were the one writing it, or what I would've written for some characters, I came to this conclusion: could all those hater think of a better way to do this?  This is still, by far, one of the best fictional series I have ever read!  All the characters a nuanced, deeply flawed, and fully fleshed out.  The intrigue and action, though somewhat lacking in this volume compared to past ones, is top notch.  And Mr. Martin's use of cliff hangers, sorcery, and realpolitik is the perfect mixture for any body who grew up on [[ASIN:0061969052 The Chronicles of Narnia]], but are ready move beyond the black & white morality of [[ASIN:0618640150 The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition]].  The most interesting thing about this book is the development of Cersei as a character.  No other character in literature has made my blood boil so much.  And yes, there are no big set pieces similar those found in the previous volumes (i.e. the Battle of Blackwater or the Red Wedding).  And yes, having only half the characters in this volume makes it feel like you're watching master juggler, who could easily juggle eight balls and a chainsaw, only juggle four balls and an axe.  But, like I said, could anyone else do it any better?  I still love this series and can't wait to begin reading  [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)]].

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|this book was not near as good as the first 2 but the ending was nice & i was glad to see s resolve of sorts.. some ppl are staying it was a bad book the war was usless ect..... however what would really happen in this?? i think the ending was great & yes it was rushed that part i didn't care for she should have extened it a couple more chapers atleast. in all it was a good book a nice ending & of course ** SPOILER** prim getting murdered was awful but in the end thats what would happen not every main character lives.. i would have liked to have heard more about gale however in the end & if he married had kids..
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Here is an inexpensive protective cover for your Kindle Fire that keeps it covered when not in use, folds out of the way when using it or turns into a hands-free stand.  The Kindle easily snapped into it with no problem.  For daily use it is great.  No bells or whistles or catchy color, just smart design and function.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book was recommended to me because I had hoped to take a physically demanding self defense course and I figured that I was toast if I did not get in shape and build up some strength.<br /><br />The book has ten levels for each of six exercise types so you can start out from totally out of shape and move up in increments.  I am currently on the second level for the three exercises that I am doing and have noticed a marked improvement in my physical conditioning even at this easy level.<br /><br />Previously I had tried to do what seemed to be simple like regular push-ups but was so out of shape that it was a massive effort to do five or ten.  After reading the book I realized that struggling to do five repetitions of an exercise that I could not really do was not helping me much.  It is much better to do three sets of 50 repetitions of the easier version and then move to the next harder version as I progress.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people at almost any level of conditioning.  It starts out easy, but I bet that even people in good shape would gain from the harder levels and more advance exercise forms.<br /><br />This conditioning plan works on the entire body, unlike some that just focus on one thing and ignore important aspects like back strength and body core conditioning.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've only read the \\"Dark Tower\\" series by Stephen King, at my husband's prompting. (He's the uber fan.)  I read this book, also at my husband's insistence, and was not disappointed.<br />Stephen King is masterful at building realistic characters and I felt that I KNEW Jake Epping by the end of the book and could understand his actions within the story.  If you like one-dimensional characters without foibles and baggage then this is not the story-teller for you. And while his characters are note-worthy, the scenery and imagery really draws you into this world and makes you feel THERE.  I would recommend to any fan of reading - regardless of preference (fiction/non-fiction, fantasy/history, etc.)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Whenever I have a deadline to meet and the project is long and hard and requires sticking with it I put on this anthology and it gets me through every single time.  I know the stories by heart, and they are so excellent that even after multiple viewings (or in my case multiple multiple \\"listenings\\") I stay sharp and engaged.  I also have to say that Alien III constantly takes a beating, but I believe it is the best (not the best quality because of some damage they had to work around when creating the Director's Cut) of the group.  If I can only watch one I'll go to this one.  I wouldn't have said this on the first viewing.  In fact, I was really disappointed.  But subsequent viewings caused me to appreciate this film very much.  It doesn't get grittier than this.  Please don't just dismiss it based on some other reviews and at least give it two or three viewings.  I absolutely believe you won't be sorry.

1439102813|3.0|Very mixed feelings about Still Alice, in some ways it captures a trying and difficult situation that many of us have had to deal with personally. The reviewer who was unhappy with the ending hits the nail on the head as it is unrealistic. Also, the author visited Galveston for the annual One City One Book program and gave three interesting oral presentations (all basically the same) that mostly concentrated on her own trails to authorship (one has to wonder about the wasted Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Harvard - mentioned in every other sentence). Lisa Genova is a diva, and if you invite her be prepared. It is a shame that an author's behavior can undermine a potentially compelling story.
B006FE83UE|5.0|SHIPPING WAS ON TIME. IT WAS PACKED VERY NICE. I HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET, IT'S FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY APRIL 1ST.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|I just had to have this watch after reading about its \\"defects\\". I have too many watches according to my wife and count several Invicta's among them.<br />This is a large, beautiful watch and I would have to say that it is the most comfortable large watch that I own, having displaced a Citizen diver from that position. Despite the large size, and I have several larger watches, it is extremely light. I really like the \\"lefty\\" style which allows me to wear the watch without the crown digging into my wrist. I have a significantly larger Russian Diver which I don't wear very often due to that problem.<br />The band is great and I really like the fabric over leather which makes the band much more flexible.<br />The face of the watch is very clean and, though their is a lack of contrast with the white face and hands it is not as much of a problem to me as others have expressed.<br />The lume is very poor as on all Invicta's, and this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.
0385534639|5.0|This book was a wonderful experience of word painting.  The words used described the beautiful of each scene.  The depth of the relationships were developed in such a way I could see the individuals clearly.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I'm not a fan of sci-fi, but while telling a friend about this book, I realized that I may need to revise my ideas of what I like, because I really liked this sci-fi, dystopian take on the classic Cinderella tale.<br /><br />A bit predictable at some points, it's a very original tale that I read quickly. Looking forward to book #2 in this series!
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I must say that I have not ever listened to much of her music before this CD outside of what was being played on the radio but I am so happy to have this music! I think its gr8!
B004GYY714|5.0|This app has been fun to listen to.  You can get music from all over the world and enough of it is free from advertising to make it totally worth what it cost.  It doesn't use too much space or battery for the kindle fire.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is really fun. If you are looking for a non exspesive time waster,this is your game. But it isn't like one of those games where u just play once and then try to beatyour high score, it is the kind thatyou play overall period of time and try to build up ur fake money (which is preatty easy) andthen Ivan buy thestuff with ur fake money to accomplish the goal and then there are more chalanges. Over all, it is a really fun game @in my opinion
0439813786|4.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is wonderfully written.  Not only does the book tell its story through words -- it also tells its story through pictures!  The book goes back and forth between drawings and images, but towards the end of the book there are more words.  The pictures really helped me to enjoy the book more, while seeing how the author imagined the characters in the book they wrote.  In actuality, this book is a pretty short read for its size. I would reccomend this book to middle-schoolers, and grade-schoolers.  However, people of an older age could certainly read this book and still enjoy it.
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|Well, I have to say this was one of the hardest books to get into, that I have ever read!! I pretty much hated it until close to the end and I started putting things together. I almost didn't finish reading the book because I was so disgusted with the way it was written. I thought the mother was so self absorbed and full of herself, but by the end I liked her and understood her better. I would have liked the author to hint earlier that things weren't as they seemed! I am glad I finished reading it, but it did take a lot of effort! My advice for someone who wants to read it, is to hang with it, the ending is worth it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I started reading the book, and had trouble putting it down. I would recommend this for anyone who reads Military novels, or wants a diary account of someone who had boots on ground there. As a Veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan I found this novel compelling.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I actually bought the book because I work at school and the kids in my American Literature class were reading the book, so I bought it so I could have it on my kindle. The book is well written and made for great classroom discussions. Krakauer did a great job. The kids seemed to enjoy the book also.
1612130283|5.0|Excellent Book... Soooo very much \\"Pretty Woman\\" Meets \\"9-1/2 Weeks\\" with a dark seeded past that threatens to invade personal space at any moment, all the while the inner goddess cheers Ana on as her subconcious fights for the good in all things... who doesn't fall in love with \\"Fifty Shades\\"..... Christian Grey might be carrying around some baggage but you still fall in love with everything about him.... I am pre-ordering the 2nd book NOW!
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I first purchased The Hunger Games, I had no idea what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised. Although it was not my usual read, I thought something different would be enjoyable. I couldn't put it down! Then, Catching Fire came and it, too, was a white-knuckler. I could hardly wait to get the third book in the Triology, The Mockinjay.<br />Last night, while watching TV - I noticed an advertisement for an upcoming movie. The names and plot caught my attention immediatly and I learned that it was The Hunger Games. I CAN'T WAIT to go and see it!!!<br />Take a chance - try something new - you won't regret getting this trilogy!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Im a knife and gun guy. I got into bush craft and did the research and poeple always spoke of the BK2 with alot of respect and rated it highly when compared to its competitors. This knife ROCKS. Its deceptive in its size, its only 5ish inches but its a thick beefy blade with fantastic handling and incredible chopping power. The edge is ok is sharp is your goal, but for a hard working  tough as nails field edge its pretty rocking. I dont mind spending on gear ...my pocket knife was $200...this knife is possibly the best value  best return on investment for a REAL hard use knife Ive found. Its plain jane looks are attractive in their own way but get it alone in the bush and watch out!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game, easy and straight forward. Addicting. One of the better free games. Can change some Colorado and card options as well which is nice.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Well, let me start with the packaging: it's absolutely beautiful. The images are all sublime as are the photographs. The rest of the memorabilia is pretty cool: DSotM black marbles (which I haven't yet decided where to display), the coasters are nice but are the week link in this box set (specially since I've seen their counterpart from The Wall box set), and the rest of the stuff like the concert tickets, backstage pass are very nice as well.<br /><br />The audio is just amazing. To have so many versions of the the album in different mixes and a live version, makes you want to listen to the Dark Side all day, every single day. What can I say, I'm a satisfied fan.
0679805273|5.0|Was very happy to receive these books quickly. My wife working on a project to have our 4 children's teachers sign the Seuss book each school year sort of as a teacher year book. At graduation each child will receive their signed copies with a  letter from us.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app! love having all my ideas, finds, and thoughts.in one place! I use it with my phone and my kindle. The app shares all  my inputs so it doesn't matter what device I have, I always have my info!
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|If you are a Metallica fan you may not necessarily enjoy Lulu. Lulu is unlike anything else I've ever heard from Metallica. The reason I purchased this 2 disc album was for the track Junior Dad. The lyrics for Junior Dad are so powerful I found myself listening to that one track a hundred times. All the other tracks were just filler I didn't care for at all.
0307352145|5.0|I am a raging extrovert, I talk a great deal and am energized by big crowds, and I always make sure that I speak to every single person in the room when I am in a social setting.  That said, I noticed a few years ago that to my chagrin, that not everyone is wired like I am and that in my dismissal of quiet introverted people due to their non involvement in the gabfest I was minimizing their value.<br /><br />I also began noticing that there were a great number of introverts that I work with, am involved in civic organizations with, and as the father of 6 children I have one introverted kid that I needed to understand better.<br /><br />This book gave me that insight from the point of view of an introvert (Cain) and gave me enough pause to slow down and listen to those around me.  I do feel though that Cain is overemphasizing the pure virtue of introversion to the detriment of us extroverts.  I came away at times with the thought that I should feel guilty for being an extrovert (I don't) and that if I wanted to be a true luminary in our world, I would find myself talking less and being circumspect more often.<br /><br />While there is value in this book for us extroverts in understanding introverts, I would keep a salt shaker close at hand so you can take each chapter with a grain of salt, you are going to need it.  I admit that there is indeed a place for this book in our modern discourse on personalities and understanding the value of the individual, but it may under-emphasize the value of us extroverts along the way.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|Its a pretty fun game, a little chuggy on the epic but still playable. Definitely worth free! The game does seem to be a bit of a battery hog, but its worth playing if you keep a charger near by.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Gave me nightmares. Makes you wonder if this is the direction in which we are going. Not for the squeamish or for people who love to stick their heads in the sand while getting run over by a truck.
0399245030|5.0|This is the sweetest book. I would say this is a perfect book with many good lessons about friendship for young children. I also think this is a great books for anyone (teens, young adults and older).  It has lovely illustrations.  If you are not familiar with Oliver Jeffers books you definitely need to take a look.  I think this should be on every school library shelf as well as in everyone's home collection.  A true delight.

Passion, passion, and passion in product development is the key to innovation.<br /><br />My intention was not to get into the nitty-gritty of Apple, Job's life and other details, but simply how he managed to build such a company after two big failures in life. A lot has been written over blogs, websites, and by other reviewers on this book, so I won't go into any details here.<br />Jobs was definitely the most innovative person from my lifetime who did \\"put a dent in the universe\\" and made such an excellent impact on our lives.
0446573019|3.0|David Baldacci must have read his first Lee Childs, Jack Reacher novel and decided he would be a good author to copy.  The only difference in Puller and Reacher, the main characters of the two authors, is one is still in the Army and the other is not.  Hey Mr. Baldacci, if you can't come up with something original, sit back and take a breather!  Did a balloon payment on your yacht come due and force you \\"Pound<br />\\" another one out?<br /><br />Being from that coal mining area of Southwest Virginia I must say that the book is based on facts.  I'm enjoying the read, but disappointed with your using a main character so much like Jack Reacher.  Shame on you!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0446573019 Zero Day]]
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a fun game. just like on the computer only now I can play on the go. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys spider solitaire.

1449305172|4.0|I figure that if I get more than one usable idea out of a 'how to' book then I am doing well.  I got three from this book - a rare achievement in a market full of formula driven thrash.<br /><br />The first message is clear - long winded business plans that pretend to predict the future have no place in a lean start up and, as someone who's done a lean start up, I agree. The other message? Focus on the customer.<br /><br />None of that is new, but what I did find new was an approach to business planning and metric monitoring that gets all the important stuff onto one page. While written for software startups, the book has lots of value for anyone trying to get a new business up and running (I'm starting a non-software company and the book has been a godsend).<br /><br />I would have given this book five stars but it is lumpy. Some points are labored, the obvious is stated a few times too many, and it is a bit heavy on the aconyms..<br /><br />But these are minor flaws in a book that is perhaps most marked by the obvious excitement of the author for his topic. As for the three things I learnt? Two have been mentioned (the one page plan and metrics - truly great) and the third was some sensible stuff startegies to follow as you  get your product to a market fit.<br /><br />If you are planning a software start up then buy this book - my guess is that you will learn something (if not you can feel comfortable in your pre-existing well rounded knowledge). If you are planning a start-up in another field then this is still worth a read. As I indicated above, I'm starting a new business (a small group tour company) and while much of the book wasn't relevant to the specifics of that business, there was enough there to justify the cover price and time taken to read it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|What is left to say? This was the best series I have read in years. I fought reading these books because sometimes when books get so much hype I find I get let down. Not so with these books.

B005FLX2WC|4.0|My only complaint about this CD is that Bonamassa's playing takes a back seat to Beth Hart's singing, which blew me away, so it's not a huge complaint.  When will these two be touring?  After listening to the CD I'd love to see them.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|These are the stories of the detective to end all detectives.  Even after having read all the stories multiple times and seeing several filmed/TV versions of many stories, I still find them captivating.  The writing style is not current --- how could it be? ... but give the stories a chance and you'll be caught up in the adventures of a lifetime.  Do not expect a lot of blood/guts/sex.  Sherlock is a \\"thinking man's\\" detective although he is not opposed to putting a villain down when needed... after all he IS a master swordsman and pugilist.  These stories are some of my favorites and I'm so very lucky to be able to carry them around with me now on my Kindle.  Thank you Amazon... and Mr. Doyle.

0712653228|3.0|This book is a great little book to add some more knowledge to your brain. Helps you become aware of the aspects of persuasion and getting what you want.
B007C4ZJ0S|1.0|This is Soderbegh in poor form. Soderbergh basically has taken a mainstream genre formula and given it an independent school of filmmaking. The hybrid of these two sensibilities don't gel that succesfully together. The shoot-outs are poorly staged and have no genuine intensity. Carano has no acting experience and it badly shows. She's convincing in the fight scenes and that's about it. Surrounded by high-class actors in this film helps overcome Carano's shortcomings with her stilted performance. Soderbergh likes using digital cameras to film his movies. I hate digital film as there's a flatness and coldness to the film. Some scenes have poor pictorial composition and it shows badly. There's just no intensity and genuine suspense in the chase through back-alleys and rooftops of Dublin. When one see's what Philip Noyce did for Angelina Jolie in SALT that's a director at the height of his game. HAYWIRE is extremly formulaic and routine. The extraction set-piece in Barcelona should have been bravado filmmaking but Soderbergh chooses to shoot the entire set-piece in silence and muted noise which would irritate mainstream audiences seeking huge thrills. The last 15 minutes of this film sinks even lower in mediocrity where it becomes nothing more then a below-par-cable movie. People looking for the female Jason Bourne will be disappointed with this film as the premise had great potential for something explosive with a more daring director. After watching HAYWIRE it's a good thing Soderbergh won't be directing THE MAN FROM UNCLE MOVIE!
0545091020|5.0|I have not read the paper version of the book. I have only listened to the cd. It is so well read, I cannot imagine that reading the book would be nearly as good.
B003E48AYC|5.0|To honest I decided to read the bad reviews to see what could possibly be bad about this or movie or what people thought was bad, and I was actually disgusted with what I read. I honestly couldnt believe it. Yes this is quite the difference from the original kids Alice in wonderland that came out way back when, but if you are looking for a good remake of a movie I think this is defiantly what you are looking for.<br /><br />I saw this movie in theaters and was just amazed with how good this movie is. When I went in and the saw the movie I honestly thought I wouldnt like the movie at all but to still give it a chance but to be honest it turns out obviously that this is a great movie if you get a chance. Yes, this is a darker, more weird version of Alice in wonderland, but that doesnt take away anything good from movie I would say it just adds on to how good this movie can be. I was very satisfied with movie, I would strongly suggest it to anyone.

I thought the concept of changing the past was very well thought out and handled beautifully. I completely enjoyed every aspect of this novel, the care and with which the premise is handled shows the master at work. I was surprised how much I cared about the characters and was sorry to see the book end.
B00024YVJU|4.0|Many fans of The Eloy consider this to be the band's masterpiece and indeed it is a very nice slice of late 70's progressive rock.  The star of the show on this one is drummer Jurgen Rosenthal who came up with the concept and wrote much of the material.  His percussion work on the album is simply stunning especially on the opening track \\"Poseidon's Creation\\".  The album consists of only 4 long tracks that tell the story of the rise and fall of Atlantis.  Lyrically it is a bit sketchy at times and the spoken word sections have not aged all that well, but overall this is a solid release from on of Germany's finest prog exports.

0307956350|4.0|As I was preparing to write this review I spent about 30 minutes reading over some of the reviews that have already been written about this book.  There are some that are so descriptive that I would be hard-pressed to give you more information than they have already done.<br />I do want to make a few comments though.  This book was one of those that captured me within the first 50 pages.  Often if a book doesn't do that I won't even continue.<br />Kate is married to Dexter and they have two children.  No one in the family is aware that she is a CIA agent.<br />What I enjoyed about the book is the perspective of a married woman acting in the role of an agent.  It was a fun read and a book that I highly recommend.  Enjoy the journey.

And a beautiful ending. Excellent.

Yet, inexplicably, it stopped working for no real reason. I'm mad because I never mishandled the item and it just decides to not turn on. I can charge it (the LED light is red). The LED, under normal circumstances, would turn purple while being used and charged at the same time., yet when I tried to turn it on it simply won't!

B0076NKLRQ|5.0|While observing this solely on the movie's merit, not if it may or may not be 'factual', as it is based on the personal diaries of Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), I definitely enjoyed this story.  A glimpse into one week of the iconic status of Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams) is a provocative notion.  I found Williams able to display the subtleties of her charge and make this demand convincing.  Williams fleshes out Monroe in a solemnization.  She neither fully inhabits nor imitates her as much as she celebrates the Marilyn Monroe everyone could appreciate.  I found her quite deft in balancing Monroe's obvious intelligence along with her shaky naivety at the same time.  Of course, Williams could never replicate Marilyn Monroe in a performance as the physicality of the two is widely different among other things, although I saw her bring the nuances and idiosyncrasies of Monroe's personality to life.  Her stage presence, sexuality, innocence, and vulnerability are all well shown.<br /><br />Into London of 1955 comes the filming of the anticipated movie &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot;.  A young, and obviously obsessed with the film business, Colin Clark, is able to get involved with the production, but more so with the object of his desire, Marilyn Monroe.  He offers her a certain freedom with his friendship during an intense time of fragility for her. He provides laughter, hushed conversations, free-spirited romps, and the ability to escape everything which includes her own harsh reality. The film, presented in this way, shows the almost over-importance of Clark in the making of Laurence Olivier's movie concerning his handling of Marilyn Monroe alone. But, of course, this is all done from his point of view, his ideas and beliefs.<br /><br />While the acting is all quite good, a complete stand out for me was Kenneth Branagh as Sir Laurence Olivier.  He pulled perfection into his portrayal of the ego driven icon that he was himself.  His mannerisms, temperament, perfectionism, and vocal all screamed &quot;Olivier&quot;.  The renowned stage actor coming into the making of this movie was a huge transition, especially while wanting to cast the Hollywood &quot;movie star&quot;, Marilyn Monroe, alongside himself.<br /><br />An understated Vivien Leigh - 'Lady Olivier' - (Julia Ormond), shows an ease in her position of his wife and a more vulnerable side with her adoration of her husband.  The wonderfully astute Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench) lends a firm hand and a necessary leading guidance for Monroe especially when sparks start to fly.  In &quot;The Prince and the Showgirl&quot; she was the softest and caring anchor for Monroe's shaky resolve and awestruck times during the filming. This all happening as Olivier's control was escaping him.  She remained soothing and tried to keep the balance between these two iconic' actors, but, more so, these two egos.<br /><br />&quot;My Week With Marilyn&quot; is just that, according to Colin Clark.  His week along with her, done from his diaries and adapted from his book. With taking this all into mind, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and have watched it several times., perfectionism, and vocal all screamed &quot;Olivier&quot;.

B0061JPYX2|5.0|This is an absolute MUST HAVE for any Amy Winehouse fan. What a treat to hear different versions of songs I already knew and loved, both hers and cover songs. Her guest artists were a nice touch as well. I have lent this CD out several times and in every case the person who borrowed it bought a copy of their own. I just hope there are more gems waiting to be released. RIP Amy.

It comes on Sunday nights at 9pm on AMC....so I started watching it in Season 2 and absolutley LOVED IT!!!!!  Therefore I purchased season 1 so I could catch up on what originally happened, it was just as good as season 2!!!! and now season 3 is almost coming to a close with one more episode and I DO NOT WANT IT TO END!!!!! I LOVE THIS SERIES AND IF YOU ARE INTO SCARY MOVIES, ZOMBIES AND A GOOD PLOT ON TOP OF IT THEN THIS IS THE SHOW FOR YOU!!!!!!The zombies are made up so amazingly you would definatley think they are real and have come straight out of the grave....very chilling!!!! ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TELEVISION......IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE SEEN THIS SHOW.... BUY THE SERIES 1, 2 & 3 YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! AND THE PRICE IS VERY REASONABLE.  THANKS AMAZON :)
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Simple, lightweight, and doesn't say \\"look at me\\".  Case fits perfectly in my pocketbook, opens with one hand, and does protect Kindle from dust, scratches, and an occasional whoops. Its intended for handheld, takes too much thought for a stand, but most practical and would purchase again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who states that Mary Gaitskill's story \\"SecretARY\\" is a darker (edgier) & better written portrayal of the BDSM lifestyle...However, the reason for the insane popularity of this book is that it kind of lets you in the pool at the shallow end..the writing in FSG is decent, well crafted and I thought Christian was well drawn and realistic portrayal of a BDSM cold, businesman. I also think EL James creates an aura of eroticism that is not dangerous but rather accessible and readable...I had very much the same experience reading Katrina Von Kessel's BLUE BLOODBATH...I recommend FSG: and am myself looking forward to some late night guilty pleasure reading of the sequal.

B0052GACNM|5.0|I am a musician and music teacher (drums) of fifty one years. I was brought up in Chicago where I was exposed to Jazz, Big Band, Be-bop, and small jazz quartets.  I love many types of music and listen to many different solo artists, bands, etc. Being a lover of Tony Bennett's music and style I had to buy Duets II.  Tony's work with all the other guest artists on the CD is in my view incredible, enjoyable, entertaining, and sophisticated.<br /><br />I cannot think of one reason that this CD wouldn't be enjoyed by many age groups. I highly recommend this CD.<br /><br />Keith Capsuto<br />Oxnard, CA
B000001FXR|5.0|CATCH A FIRE is the second mainstream album release for The Wailers. Contrary to popular belief, their first album released outside of Jamaica was SOUL REBEL in 1970.  This, however, would be the album were Reggae truly arrived & the masses took notice. This was the album that inspired singers/songwriters around the world, both known and unknown, to learn how to write & perform Roots & Ska Reggae.  The bands primary members, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh & Bunny Wailer, along with Aston Barrett, Carlton Barrett & John Bundrick,  were about to embark on a truly historic run that would bring the poetic, revolutionary & spiritual nature of Reggae to an audience that had never heard anything quite like that before.<br /><br />Although the entire band worked wonderfully together as a cohesive unit, this was very much an album that was dominated by the musical genius of Bob Marley who wrote every song with the exception of 2 which were written by Peter Tosh. However, one of those songs by Tosh, \\"400 years\\", is one of my personal favorites on the album. Take a listen to that one and reflect as it's pure lyrical & musical mastery! Overall one of the most important albums in music history as it was the beginnging of one of the most influential periods of the 20th century.<br /><br />CATCH A FIRE was the culmination of years of hard work were The Wailers took an island genre, honed it's sound & message, into a reflection of the injustices and hardships they were experiencing in Jamaica & other island nations & made it mainstream. Reggae as a particular genre of music now generates billions of dollars worldwide and The Wailers are one of the primary reasons why.  I think one of the most underappreciated things about this band is it's musicianship.<br /><br />The albums first track, \\"Concrete Jungle\\" has a gorgeous introduction with an almost blues rock feel to it and the guitar solo is spectacular.  The variety on the album is wonderful, from the hard driving songs of opression like this song, \\"Slave Driver\\" and the aforementioned \\"400 years\\" to a song of courtship and desire like \\"Baby We've Got A Date\\" that has almost a Country music feel with the slide guitar.  This was a time of great revolution for around the world for oppressed peoples to be able to live, love, worship and express how they felt according to their own conscious.  The island nations were fighting for freedom from their european oppressors as were many of the African nations with whom The Wailers shared a kindred spirit with and their songs were the songs of freedom, in all aspects of life, for many of those nations and became a ralling cry as well.<br /><br />These were the times of movements such as \\"Black Power\\" & \\"Civil Rights\\" here in the U.S. and many historical artists and bands were picking up their pens and writing songs of revolution. The sheer poetry of groups like The Impressions, Earth, Wind and Fire, Sly and the Family Stone and artists like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and James Brown, were singing about those of African heritage rising up and solidifying their power and spear heading a revolution of sorts here too.<br /><br />It's interesting that The Wailers patterned their group after The Impressions with a rich poetic vibe along with a gospel or Spiritual message just under the surface. This is a clear portrait of what made this band great and historic. The Wailers who were truly about to shake the very foundations of the world in a very short period of time had, by this time, developed a tight sound to go with their lyrical content.<br /><br />The Wailers were blessed with three very talented and deeply spiritual songwriters in Marley, Tosh and Neville O'Riley Livingston aka Bunny Wailer. The music they made as a part of this band and the music produced after their break up are some of the most beloved at any point in music history. This was truly a special time as the world was changing at a rapid pace and no one had ever heard of this type of music, coming from this point of view before at least not on a \\"mainstream\\" level.<br /><br />This is why today The Wailers and especially Bob Marley are so very beloved and admired by countless millions around the world. Their songs were songs of revolution and not just in a physical since but also mental and spiritual as well. Their will never be another band like them and those of us who were blessed to witness their greatness while together have never and will never be the same.g from this point of view before at least not on a \\"mainstream\\" level.<br /><br />This is why today The Wailers and especially Bob Marley are so very beloved and admired by countless millions around the world.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Have enjoyed the entire Hunger Games Trilogy and am looking forward to the movie.  I got the Kindle Edition so have no idea why I am writing a review since it is instantly downloaded through whisper net
0385342063|3.0|...really really hard. I give this book 3 stars because it did hold my interest and I love Sophie Kinsella, but I know she can do better. The heroine is a complete idiot who shouldn't be allowed to vote. I'm sure the intention was to make her quirky and lovable, but I just got frustrated with her and her stupid compusions to send out emails under the director's name. Who in their right mind would ever think it was appropriate to sign a stranger up for dance classes? Or to go to Iceland? Or Guatemala?? Really? I found this book to be as irritating as Shopaholic Ties the Knot, where I wanted to throw Becky from a speeding train. And Poppy Wyatt is basically a reincarnation of Becky Bloomwood. They think the same and have the same internal dialogue. And they both make very stupid, impulsive decisions. Becky manages to meddle in Luke's business affairs and embarrass him and Poppy does the same to Sam. Sophie Kinsella has a distinct prose<br />but usually her characters are different in each of her books, but not this one. I felt this was just unoriginal and repetitive. Whomever is rushing Sophie to finish her books needs to stop it.

0739378333|4.0|I had never read any of John Grisham's books, but I had seen some of the movies made from his books.  I bought the book and was very pleased.  It was an interesting read which was also very easy to read due to the large print.  I really enjoyed reading it and had a hard time putting it down once I started reading.  It gave me some insight into the workings of the judicial system on the part of lawyers and participants.  I was really happy I had made the purchase.
B005FITIK0|5.0|The movie advertised as a comedy, but throughout the movie, there were, if at all, very few moments that made me laugh.I was never a fan of Charlize Theron, because I thought she was just your stereotypical, pretty faced actress, but I am a fan now. Her acting is great, and the movie was greatly cast. As for the movie, the one word that I can describe Young Adult is: \\"realistic\\". There's nothing dramatized here, nothing romanticized: we have Mavis (Theron) who hasn't grown up, and is stuck in denial and refuses to believe that she is a failed \\"author\\". In short, it's a story about a middle aged (possibly mentally insane)woman who hasn't grown up, and makes horrible choices trying to win back her married, high school sweetheart. Then at the end, when she realizes her mistakes, she learns from them and finally transitions from being a young adult to an empathetic, functioning adult.... well, that's where the tragedy sinks in. You root for her to change, to grow up, and to become a better person. But one conversation in the end makes her relapse, and makes us viewers want to smack her in the head, and proclaim that this was a bad movie. But it is because of this, it was a great movie for me. Like I said, if you are expecting comedy, don't watch Young Adult. But if you want to see a \\"realistic tragedy\\", that is somehow very refreshing (if that's the right word) watch this movie.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|great time killer with interesting challenges and lots of levels. got it for free but worth 99 cents. definitely would recommend it.
B007IQX1G4|3.0|This movie says its a comedy, but its really not. Unless you find the main character's drunken ramblings and pathetic attempts at seduction funny. The only parts I found funny were short interactions with a certain hotel clerk.<br />That being said this movie was good to see, it certainly was different, then say Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, but Romy and Michelle was funny and has rewatchability. This movie I would not need to see again, because the drama is just so cringeworthy.<br />Charlize Theron plays this part well, although it just seemed too easy for her to project, maybe she knows what its like to be popular and fawned over for her looks.<br />This movie actually earns an extra star because of Patton Oswalt! Who knew Patton could be so heartbreakingly good, and every part of it was believable, especially the scene where he has to take his shirt off and he crosses his arms.<br />All in all I wouldnt recommend this film for the casual moviegoer, only people who can appreciate subtlety, a dark film, and maybe Patton Oswalt fans (but certainly not for Ratatouille)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is an engaging novel with an interesting storyline. It is told through the eyes of only one of its characters, Katniss, but she has enough life experiences to leave the reader understanding her well. The premise is completely believable.  Some of the technology requires a leap of faith, but, being a fan of HG Wells, Michael Chrichton, and George Lucas, I entirely enjoy making that leap.  An easy and quick read that has left me eager to start the sequel.

B004LWZW9C|1.0|This is as calculated and commercial a film as can be imagined. Rredictable from the first instant to the last, it's as shallow and lifeless as they come. At some point, somebody involved must have had an impulse that was sincere and genuine, but there is no shred of authenticity left in this deathly film. New Year's Eve is a pastiche of numerous stories, most of them retreads, acted out by a large cast of celebrities. Only a handful of characters are given the opportunity to become at all \\"real,\\" and many are just shallow and annoying anyway, so the viewer has little reason to care how the various trivial complications work out (though it's obvious that they will). Anyone looking for genuine human depth in the characters will not find it, though Halle Berry and Hilary Swank do breathe life into their parts. This film it its own kind of pornography. Heaven knows there's nothing remotely sexy about it; it's just that everyone is clearly faking it all the way through in a laughingly obvious way. The soundtrack is equally heavy-handed and obvious. Even viewers who simply want to eyeball the attractive cast members will be disappointed. Everybody's bundled up and hatted or pregnant or in some other way made unglamourous (except K. Heigl in an amazingly slinky dress, but she's such an unbearable, self-absorbed character that there's no appeal). The setting -- New York -- is also presented in a flat, dull, mostly ugly manner. I thought I would enjoy this film -- just looking for a light, charming couple of hours -- but it's such a cynical construction, so utterly heavy-handed and fake, that it made me really depressed. Yeah, the narrator gives us a dumb little lecture at the end about hope or something, but at that point I was sullen and pissed off at Garry Marshall's horrible direction. He, and everyone involved in this piece of crap, should be ashamed of themselves. I hope it lost a load of money, and I advise DVD buyers... not to. If you really enjoy reading greeting cards, maybe...

B0038NN3B4|5.0|I half-heartedly bought this book thinking \\"Oh, here we go again.  Another diet.\\"  But it was far from that. It made sense. I read the book, put the theories and ideas into practice, and in 8 months, I lost 35 pounds.  Five months later, I'm in maintenance, and I love the fact that I can live a normal life, with no boxo meals, and be healthy, because of the New Atkins way of living. Not only have I changed my weight, I cut my cholesterol from 215 to 167. My doctor wanted to put me on cholesterol meds -- I said no way! Let me get it down myself. In 90 days, I was able to get my cholesterol from 215 (which had been closer to 300 prior to her checking it) down to 167 with good food choices from New Atkins and exercise (3 to 4 times a week, 20-30 minutes a day).  This worked for me. I say, what do you have to lose?  Pounds!

B00506NRBS|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I have ever read that helped me to get off the couch and get on the road to success.  I was able to understand what Derek was talking about when he explained ideas and execution, and put it into practice.  At work, some of those ideas have now turned into a group of people coming together to help our community through a mentoring program for sewing, knitting and crocheting.  So far, we have helped two organizations with our projects, and have helped our group members with their skills to be able to pass down traditions that are being lost in the hectic hustle and bustle world of today.  I'm not sure I would have had the initiative if not for Anything You Want...thanks Derek!
B005HNG1S0|4.0|These Mozart Piano Concertos are played within the context of the classical style. Phrasing and terraced dynamics are superb.<br />The tempos are great and the balance between the orchestra and soloist is outstanding. I would highly recommend<br />these recordings.
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|First of all, this  particular Diana Ross album is  the one I've been waiting for in the continuing and beyond excellent series of expanded re-issues overseen by Andrew and Harry and issued by Hip-O Select.  The bar has been raised higher for all future expanded cd reissues with the meticulous research into every detail and quality of excellence in sound and packaging that  Hip-O Select provides consumers with, every time out.  CD collecting made fun, again.<br /><br />For me, THIS 'Diana Ross 1976' album was about her best- ever, though the expanded 'Surrender' (buy it!) and expanded 'Diana Ross' 70 (buy it!) were great.  'Diana Ross 1976' belongs in the home of every fan of Diana Ross. This cd is housed in  a gorgeous looking fold out digipack.  The alternate takes are interesting to hear, and usually are quite excellent and show that Diana Ross really wasn't capable of a 'bad take' in the studio. She'd try a few approaches, get her phrasing and 'timing' perfect, and usually, Motown made very good choices in which 'take' was used on an album, but she always delivered.  That's Diana Ross to me, and that's Andrew and Harry in the work they do. They preserve her legacy with each of their releases-  Andrew and Harry always deliver and I gladly buy every product they work on, and I am never disappointed.<br /><br />The 2 men are so overdue for Grammy wins for 'best reissue', 'best liner notes'  'best historical reissue'--  for their spot on excellence and great attention to detail.  Every cd Andrew and Harry put their brainpower and heart into  is a must-have and fans will never be sorry for the purchases.<br /><br />This time out, on 'Diana Ross 1976' the track that especially stands out for me is an alternate version of 'To Love Again', used for a later album.  For the first time, we hear the song with a beautiful French spoken introduction by Diana that totally transforms the song, already gorgeous to begin with, into an multi-national ode of lost love, a reserve for hope 'to love again,' and the song also concludes with her perfect,  lovely spoken French words.  I don't know what she's saying, i'd need a translator, but it is gorgeous.  I also appreciate the alternate takes of 'I Thought It Took A Little Time' and the single mixes of the songs as they were heard on radio.  The booklet is stunning, filled with informative session notations and a very good overview of where Diana was at that particular moment in time-which is the style Andrew and Harry choose for every release. NICE photos, and just a beautifully presented package.<br /><br />Oh- the price is  a bargain!  Let's not be cheap, wink.  It's DIANA ROSS, brought to you by the 2 biggest champions of her recording career and talent.  Buy it, and buy an extra.  The expanded 40th anniversary release of 'Where Did Our Love Go' is now selling for  hundreds of dollars, when it can be found, since it has been out of print for some time, and some kvetched about the original  $40 price-tag.  I don't need to make money on eBay when things go out of print, but if you must, think of it as an investment.  The expanded 'Last Time I Saw Him' release with a full cd of unreleased material sold out within a year.<br /><br />This 'Diana Ross 1976' release, and all of the releases, are the most thorough and beautiful tributes to the incomparable skill of Diana Ross as a recording artist that could be asked for. \\"Someday''- everyone will get it.  The Hip-O releases are so intricate in the way her talent as a world class recording artist is presented, people may 'get it' sooner than later.  Andrew and Harry and Hip-O  definitely DO give her the due credit and provide a beautiful listening experience for her fans, uncover lost treasures, and make it all gorgeous to look at.  Can't wait for whatever comes next- maybe 'Baby It's Me' and 'Ross' together and charge whatever they want for it!<br /><br />If possible, it would be awesome if Hip-O Select would  offer for sale limited lithograph prints or posters of 'Surrender', 'Let The Music Play:DRATS'- loved that cover photo a lot, the current 'Diana Ross 76,'  'Last Time I Saw Him'.  I notice the Hip-O website has prints or books on some of the artists, but no Diana or Supremes- but thankfully, we have these magnificent releases.  A must-have for any Diana Ross fan or for those interested in one of Motown's best selling albums of the 1970s.

B003ZHVJFA|3.0|I've pretty much been following the storyline of Tekken's video game. But I guess Kazuya had his \\"dirt-bag switch\\" on before Jin was born (as opposed to after).<br /><br />Hollywood, being Hollywood, took it's liberties and added a couple of \\"Hollywood-style s*x scenes.\\" The film also had a few \\"AW! THAT'S FAKED!\\" moments. But the movie's not necessarily bad. Atleast the setting and plot were consistent enough.<br /><br />A nice attempt, though. Better than \\"King of Fighters,\\" WAY better than that second Street Fighter movie that featured Chun-Li.
0307269191|5.0|I received this as a gift from a good friend who understands my passion to run marathons. I honestly never heard of Murakami. I am no literary genius by any stretch, but I found his writing quite enjoyable, entertaining and liked his openness and honesty about how he views life, people, etc. Given what is going on in my life at the present moment, I definitely could relate. I absolutely loved this book and am going to pass this on to all of my running friends. You don't need to be a runner to appreciate this book. I also think there is definitely a correlation between creative types and taking to the road of running. It has always been my way exploring my inner creativity and thought process.

031617615X|5.0|I must say I did not know about the series until I saw it was going to be made into a movie. (It was featured in my Entertainment Weekly Magazine.) When I read the description, I thought that sounds like a great story. I proceeded to order the first book to try it out, and BAM I was hooked. I was actually glad I had not known about the series until just before the last book was due to be published because the wait would have killed me. The series kept me engrossed the whole time and I could not put the books down. I have read the series twice already and I can't wait to read it all over again.
B003A02W0I|4.0|I must say the book kept me reading as I had to find out what happened to Rachel Sexton and Michael and, much like the other Brown books I've read, it was a record-time completion and edge-of-my seat suspense.  Dan Brown has that ability and that's probably why I read all his books and hopefully will be able to complete all my reviews on this author!  This would make a great movie (I read so much I hope I just didn't miss the movie since I much prefer books to movies!!).

B006BQI1V2|5.0|I think this is the first movie that is better than the book. Or at least it was for me. I tried reading the book Sarah's Key and it just fell flat, the jumping between time periods and stories irritated me to no end. I have read an enormous amount of info about the time period, WWII, what horrific garbage the Nazi's did to their own people let alone other countries people. I was in my element but the writing was dull. I eventually put the book down and never looked back. And when I saw it had been made into a movie I was mildly curious. Mildly, generally the books blow the movies out of the water and so if I couldn't get through the book what could the movie hold for me? On a whim I gave it a shot. I am glad I did. So very glad.<br /><br />This movie is powerful, the acting is done very well, and the movement between time periods is not jolting. I even appreciated having to read some parts of the movie. I say some becuase not all of it is in French and the fact that about 3/4 of the movie is in French made it all the more authentic. It is a very well made and thought out film!

B002V0929W|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I picked up \\"Watching the English.\\" Even though it is a non-fiction book it reads like a story and a funny one at that. Some of the descriptions were too detailed and repetitive but on the whole it was an enjoyable experience. Having read the book I am more sensitive to cultural differences and language neuances. It's not enough to speak the vernacular fluently, it's all about how it is used. Lots of fun.
B006X96PF6|5.0|Revised to a 5 from a three after comment below my original...<br /><br />Original - It is a nice CD, but a number of repeat songs I have on several other CDs.  Not sure I would have bought the whole thing, I should have gotten the few new songs off of iTunes.
B0050AV5MW|3.0|This book is amazing.  I'll admit I didn't buy it until I started watching the show, but I'm nearly at the end of the 4th book, and I'm still riveted.  There are a LOT of characters to keep straight, so it can't be casually read; it requires a good deal of concentration.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this book is the Kindle edition format.  It's my first proper book I downloaded to my Kindle, and there are a good amount of typos.  They're not terrible, and I can figure most of them out, but it is a little annoying.  Also, one of the books does not allow you to scroll through the chapters.  It goes from the beginning of the book to the end of the book if you try to go chapter by chapter.  Because this book is so complicated, and all the characters and situations overlap, it's sometimes necessary to go back a few chapters to remind yourself 'what this guy was doing last,' or 'to whose house does this knight belong', etc.  It was extremely frustrating to have to scroll back three chapters page by page.  I ended up having to bookmark the first page of each chapter, which frankly, was a huge pain and completely interrupted the flow of the book.<br /><br />I love this book, and plan on getting the next two in the series, but PLEASE Amazon, go through and properly edit and format your Kindle books.  I hope this isn't indicative of the quality of all Kindle editions.

B0001I55OC|1.0|I received three movies today and even though Timeline was in a sealed package it is cracked near the center and is tacky as it has been glued. Not real happy with this but I do not think I should pay the expense to send it back. The other two were fine.rip off and the seller was never even kind enough to replace this item or refund my account!
0132350882|5.0|I dare go so far as to say anyone who considers themselves a software developer with any pride in their work should give this a read.  It will make you think about many of the practices we exercise on a daily basis and re-evaluate how you go about dealing with them.<br /><br />Robert \\"Uncle Bob\\" Martin is an authority in the field of software development for a reason.  Many of the practices he and his team exercise are in this book in very well written detail, ready to be considered for anyone else out there anxious to know how to become more of a \\"craftsman.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone truly wishing to hone their skills as a developer.  Not only will this help you become a better programmer - it will help your entire team develop better practices.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game to play in your free time. And great for kids. Keeps them busy. And its a very addicting game.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I read the books first and had no idea what the TV show would be like. I was cautious at first because there were only 10 episodes so I didn't know if it would be worth it or not, but it definitely is. The bonus features really deliver, I would probably pay $40 just for those. It's a great product to go along with a book and it is fantastic to see it visually represented! Looking forward to the next seasons!
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I love it it is sooooooo fun how u can jump!<br />note to.the people who hate it:u r crazy!!!!!!!!!!!<br />can u beat all the levels??
B005H2IAM6|4.0|I admit I am a huge fan of the original anime version and had been anticipating seeing this latest adaption since I first caught wind of it in 2010 prior to the actual release. That said, I was not disappointed in the least, which says something in itself after the build up waiting for the DVD release (and disappointment of learning their would not be a US big screen release or even a US DVD release). The production value is awesome, not just in consideration of the budget, but truly amazing on all levels. The only thing I thought wasn't top-notch was the subtitled dialog. I can't speak to the actual spoken dialog which was likely more natural being the native language of the production; but the translated subtitled dialog was a bit stiff. This was definitely not enough to lower my overall estimation of the film, as it did little to disconnect me from the characters or the story, both of which I found engaging. In fact, my wife (who is not a fan of the original anime version) walked into the room a third away through my screening and commented that she was going to have to watch it later from the beginning because she found she liked the characters after watching just a few scenes. I do have a word of caution for those of you who have younger children with whom you may have shared the anime version: this is not appropriate for young children. While the overall plot somewhat follows the original storyline (skipping many points due to obvious time constraints) the tone is much darker that the original, and though the violence is not overtly graphic (no gore), there are more than a few fatalities portrayed on screen that probably put it in the PG-13 or higher range.
1849800081|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moQOM4019PP2MX]]<br />READ THIS TOP TEXT ON CHINESE IP AND TECHNOLOGY LAWS - THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN ENGLISH<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Some familiarity with Chinese law would be a distinct advantage if either you or your clients do business in China, or plan to do so in this potentially lucrative trading arena. However, until fairly recently, books on Chinese commercial law in English, have been thin on the ground.<br /><br />Fortunately, the internationally orientated Elgar Publishing, has helpfully addressed this problem with several excellent books on the subject, one of which we're reviewing here, namely: `Chinese Intellectual Property and Technology Laws' edited by Rohan Kariyawasam, who, among other impressive qualifications, boasts a Fulbright scholarship to Harvard on his CV.<br /><br />This excellent volume offers much to learn from.  Providing an overview of China's intellectual property and technology laws, this is a compilation of learned papers from eighteen expert contributors, who, according to Mark Wu of Harvard Law School, have `played important roles in shaping China's IP system and tackling the many challenges confronting it'. As the publishers point out, this is the very first time that reviews of Chinese intellectual property and technology laws have been combined in a single volume in English.<br /><br />The Director of the IP Division of the WTO (World Trade Organization) Anthony Taubman pays tribute to the book as `an invaluable guide for the policymaker, the analyst and the practitioner, offering as it does, `a comprehensive overview of (China's) IP system just at the time it begins to assume central significance on the world stage.'<br /><br />The book is extensively and meticulously footnoted and contains the research tools one would expect from works of this stature, including a thought provoking introduction, detailed index and table of contents. There's a table of cases, a table of national acts, regulations, notices and measures and a table of international conventions and treaties.<br /><br />Particularly pertinent to students and academics, as well as the business community, the book is a rich resource of rather fascinating legal, historical and socio-economic insights into Intellectual Property from the Chinese perspective.<br /><br />For anyone interested in discovering more about the many factors behind China's emergence as an economic superpower, (whether lawyer, academic, or not), this volume should be added to any well stocked professional library.There's a table of cases, a table of national acts, regulations, notices and measures and a table of international conventions and treaties.<br /><br />Particularly pertinent to students and academics, as well as the business community, the book is a rich resource of rather fascinating legal, historical and socio-economic insights into Intellectual Property from the Chinese perspective.<br /><br />For anyone interested in discovering more about the many factors behind China's emergence as an economic superpower, (whether lawyer, academic, or not), this volume should be added to any well stocked professional library.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|love the game its fun and I play with my daughter and neighbor. it allows in app purchases but I have a password so the younger kids don't go crazy. works great kindle fire!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The good: I'm loving this book so far. I don't have to say, Oh I didn't know it was kink, I knew it and downloaded it right on my kindle PC. Now, I'm in the middle of it, but just got the second book even fiftier! lol I'm enjoy the mind games! Would be lovely to have this as a cool european movie. Just saying.<br /><br />The Bad<br />If I hear her Ana say one more time. \\"OMG!, \\"Crap\\" I'm going to hurl! lol Is she 21 or 14?<br /><br />The Grey<br />Anytime there's a mind game going on, I'm very intrigued. I haven't been this excited since \\"Mooddust and Madness\\" Look it up! That had scifi in it too!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this app get it its the best app ever when u do add me lizz445 pls i need neighbors.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I just wanted to get to know Steve Jobs, the man with the vision to steer Apple into the Hall of Fame of personal computer, music & animation history.<br />Very insightful especially knowing that the book is mainly built on interviews who have been in the shadow of this visionary.  Overall good read if you know nothing about Apple and computing history, its like an insider edition, can't get much better than this.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|This is very similar to a lot of flash games where you ride a dirt bike/monster truck/4 wheeler/etc.. over obstacles while trying not to crash.  It looks way better than any of those though.  I set it with the button controls and it plays perfectly on my kindle fire.<br /><br />The game includes OPENFEINT, but thankfully it's off by default.
B0017UOU9Y|5.0|what can i say; how it was supposed to be heard. for those of us younger \\"Y\\"-ers who's first into to this was cassette or CD, the tracks on vinyl of Can u Get to That?, I Miss My  Baby, You and Your Folks, Wars, and not to ever be left out MAGGOTBRAIN are exquisite. Hightly recommeded even if it is a re-issue.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i used color not prior and it got the job done, but after the tagging system and improved page design i doubt i could go back.
B000MQ54OY|3.0|I purchased this DVD for my great-nephew for Christmas because he is into watching animated movied.  While I watched this movie, one of which I purchased for my own viewing, I was horrified that I had  bought this for a 2-year old.  I had no idea there would be quite so much adult content.  I wish there was a coding or grading setup so that unsuspecting people such as myself would know this up front.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really e.joy the games. they are new and different which is refreshing. its great they all points are not eaisly earned. makes it challenging.  will suggest to my friends.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Brilliant, its on of my favourites.was so happy to find a copy to replace my old and very worn CD.postage was a breeze,even all the way to Australia.!
0307593312|2.0|I found IQ84 to be a poorly constructed novel. Its discombobulated structure made the events in the story seem made up on the spot. To me, Murakami's writing lacks cohesion. The way he builds mystical events throughout his novel feel extremely contrived and unbelievable. He is unable to commit to rendering this magical world he creates for his characters. He leaves too many loopholes and unanswered question that just leave me very, very confused.
B0032Y8XH8|2.0|This one is a real head scratcher for me. What's the big appeal? Banjos and fiddles? Uh, it might help if more of the songs actually had some hooks and creativity to them. Really, to my ears this album is all about atmosphere and mood, and no real substance or staying power. Yes, the musicians play well, but the songs are weak overall. Are there any songs on here that you think you'll be wanting to hear again 10 years from now? I sure can't think of any. This album definitely ranks as one of my biggest disappointments of the past year.
1606865617|5.0|What a beautiful piece. The sensations, images, smells of Kerala are bound together with an earthly magic that lets the reader linger in this world even after the book is finished.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|luv the game very fun add me if u want but i just started most of these games im not very good yet
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Deepak does it again! Amazing guide that works for me. I loved how easy it was to implement these everyday trues into my life in a way that allowed me the room I needed to grow. Thank you again Chopra for all your beautiful words.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|title says it all. this game crashes at the startup screen do not purchase on the Acer A200 tablet as the game crashes out.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|cannot get it to download on nh kindle fire. been trying for two days! wish I could figure this out. loved this app on my phone.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|It is a little nice device. Garmin is the state of the art in gps artiffacts, and this one is compact, accurate, and well made. I have used several garmin gps for several years, i started with Forerunner 50, forerunner 305 and now forerunner 405. One of the best thing about FR405 is it is capable to get signal from sats quickly, even better than FR305. I can not go out on my bike or on my shoes without it.
1565114159|1.0|I order only hard copies of books and with my order I received 3 books and instead of this book I received an audio disk.<br /><br />Its a waste of my money for shipment, VAT tax 20% which I pay for import, etc. I would never pay for an audio disk of a book!!! I will never shop from Amazon.com again!<br /><br />Maybe this book is good, but I will never know.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love the real version of this game but this port constantly crashes. Still needs some work. Using it on CM9 on GSM Galaxy Nexus.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very enjoyable little game. had a lovely time playing while the kids ran at the park. thank you ever so much!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is awonderful puzzle when killinng time. The music is relaxing, many challenging levels.  I  like the fact it has a hint key if you get stumped!  love both of the Quell aps works great on KINDLE Fire!  THE music on this game is very relaxing as you play the many challenging levels.  Hope their will be more Quell games in the future!
B005YVTHT0|4.0|First thing you'll need to know is that if you've used other wheels (the kind with a fixed base), this one will take some getting used to.  It's not attached to anything but a long, sturdy USB chord and relies on accelerometers for sensing input, like a smartphone or a wiimote.  This was a little jarring at first, because the wheel doesn't rotate around a fixed axis so feeling position isn't always the easiest.<br /><br />However, the after playing with your sensitivity settings and tweaking it, the accelerometers do a hell of a job giving you precise, immediate control.  Obviously there's no force feedback or any of that, it would have been nice to have some sort of vibration though, but not crucial.  The paddles on the back, which take care of acceleration and braking, are also very precise, though I wish they had a stronger or adjustable spring return, just for a little more positive pressure.<br /><br />There are loads of buttons on this thing, and they're set up for one specific racing title (Simraceways), which admittedly I didn't play too much of.  Most of my driving was in F1 2010/2011 and Dirt 3.  Since the buttons are labeled it was pretty easy to translate which ones I wanted to handle which tasks in those games.<br /><br />Overall, though, the thing looks pretty cool.  Honestly it's a tad embarrassing to have a giant force feedback wheel sitting near your desk, they're bulky and get in the way.  This little guy can go up on a shelf when not in use and just looks like racing memorabilia which is a nice little bonus.  I do wish it came with a rotating stand, though, something it could mount to when you're playing a game to give you that fixed axis that most racing gamers are used to.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|its 1 of da best motercycle games I played I'm downloading it right now so I dont no hopefully it dont proov me tong ok
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Love the watch it is great, getting complements on it already, im so happy i purchased it, great price, looks durable, very stylish, it is big! which is great, fast shipping from lasershipping, excelent product all around. very satisfied would definately by another invicta watch.
B0051BNRTO|4.0|Read the book when it first came out and just finished listening to the audio. Found the audio more interesting as the humor comes through better at the slower pace of listening. Also, the audio is read by three different actors- one each for Annie, Duncan and Tucker. In the audio the bits where one character relates what happens to another character or what they say is rather different than in the reading and gives more depth to the \\"Annie through Tucker's eyes\\" and similar parts. Tucker comes through as a more engaging character in the telling than in the reading.<br />Have read all of Hornby's novels and would put this as one of his better but not his best. Really liked the audio and will now listen to \\"Long Way Down\\" which also has multiple readers.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I have the other versions of this game and they are a lot of fun. This one is unplayable because of the lack of tilt control. Galaxy Nexus.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This book falls under the category of average. It is by far not one of his best nor his worst books. A little different than his other story lines but enjoyable none the less.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|If you are looking for an exact play of the book, this isn't quite it.  The characters are slightly different than what you may have imagined while reading and while Jane Austen's book is quoted all throughout, the story line was changed a bit.  However, this movie does a pretty good job of condensing 122,618 words into 129 minutes of pleasing, albeit fast paced, visual entertainment.  The Blu-ray quality is lovely, I haven't had a need to use the DVD yet and the digital copy I will probably access via iTunes since I never managed to get my digital copy (which is a piece of paper with a code on it) of Tangled to work via Windows Media Center - and once you use those codes they are apparently lost to you forever.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is just as great as all the others. A page turner that will keep you up reading at night.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I was very impressed with this movie. It is a must see for Husbands and Fathers! I have been telling all my friends about how wonderful it is.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|If you are a Bruce fan you must have this box set. The documentary is okay but the live show is fantastic. A great package for one the greatest albums of all time.
B004G6009K|4.0|Not the strongest Disney story ever but it was presented pretty well. Nice clean animation. The digital copy could have been of a better resolution/quality but looks good on mobile devices.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is by far one the best series of books published in a long time. Everyone will enjoy these books, not only fantasy lovers. The complexity of charters and story line keeps you wanting more.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|This game is a good way to spend some time. A lot of fun, and the controls are easy to pick up.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesn't work in Samsung galaxy nexus with ICS. I can't believe I paid for this app.  The Galaxy nexus is not in the list of incompatible devices, but it should be.
B005TVYVI2|4.0|Update to 4-Stars June 2012: It appears to have been a connection issue.  The battery is, by design it would seem, a little loose in the cap and was making intermittent contact with the anodes.  The slightest flex of the casing or tiniest shock broke the contact enough to cause the bizarre behaviour.  It now seems to be operating as it should, for the moment at least.  I'll swim with it a few times before making a final verdict on the cure, but it looks promising that this was the full extent of the problem.  All I had to do was re-seat the battery and make sure the anodes were not bent out of the way of the battery.  It would have got 5-Stars had it worked flawlessly from the start, but since the fix was simple, and the support response from Finis first-rate (Shannon E., well done!), I've docked it only one star for what might be only a minor design issue that is easy to resolve.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Original 2-Star Review posted in March 2012 (for background info): I just started to play with the Finis Tempo Trainer Pro in my hotel room today before going swimming and there appears to be an intermittent malfunction with it.  It sometimes crashes/shuts itself off (after just a few seconds of use) for no apparent reason, or starts a steady-state tone like it's stuck when I turn it back on after it crashes.  I'll continue to play with it to see if I can figure out what's triggering the problem.  I might have got a bad one.  Two stars for now.
B00479SVBU|1.0|First one arrived, sounded like music was being played in a barrel, poor volume also. Second one arrived, no display. Kinda hard to tune the radio to match the transmitter when you can't see the station number. Very disappointed, sending both back.
B003Y5HWGI|3.0|This was purchased as a Christmas present.  I received it after Christmas.  Unfortunately, the set came with two Disc 3's and the 4th Disc was missing.  When I called for a replacement Disney Studios was courteous and helpful.  They sent me a return label and envelope.  When they received Disc 3 they determined it was a Pirated copy and could not replace it with the missing Disc 4.  It was promptly returned to me. I was advised to contact the shipper.  I did that with no response so we will never know what happened in the 7th season Disc 4.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this show!  I just discovered it this year and I've been catching up on the all the reruns.  The whole cast gels perfectly and the writing is brilliant.  I think I'd like to start purchasing the series collections.  It's one of my top three favorite shows now.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|wonderful movie because of the excellent singing and story line.<br />I've watch it over and over;<br />I believe it will be a classic because of Whitney houston
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app for Bible reading is a must have.  One can highlight their favorite scriptious along with planning your daily reading.  I love it.

1594744769|5.0|I, like other avid readers, love it when a story takes to place that seems almost real. I finished this book in just over a day. I could not put it down. I would love to see this as a movie or mini-series on HBO or Showtime. I'd also love a sequel of the characters' travels. This book was like brain candy: easy to read and left me wanting me.
1466401885|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is a coming of age story that punches with a wallop of WOW! Abby is a typical college freshman who has a history that she wants to separate herself from. Travis is the worst kind of trouble, the smoking hot kind that leaves trails of broken hearts. The kind of guy who isn't afraid to put his blood, sweat and tears on the line. When these two worlds collide it's a beautiful disaster.<br /><br />To me, Beautiful Disaster asks the simple question: How much, is too much to love? The answer is complex because I have three daughters and I wouldn't want them to get this intensely involved with anyone, especially at the young age of 19. Or would I? Or perhaps the better question is: did I? And the answer is yes; at that age I loved and hurt just as much as Abby did. I felt the same doubts and desires that she did. And I too fell in love with a bad boy.<br /><br />I'll be frank when I say too many of us tend to forget the dumb things we did in college, we use our older, wiser selves to judge. This book made me think. Was I that naïve? Was I that bold? Was I that smart and stupid in equal measure? All the answers are yes. Beautiful Disaster reminded me of those intense emotions and that frantic time when life was so full of possibility that it's almost overwhelming. Every single one of my beautiful disasters made me who I am today and I'd bet it made Jaime McGuire who she is: an up and coming author with something real to say.
0307593312|1.0|I think this book is very mediocre. There is nothing compelling about it as people claimed this book was worth reading. It is too over-hyped.

B0078JOAOI|5.0|Starting with episode 8 in February this show has made a complete turnaround for the good.  The long drawn out emotional soap-opera scenes have taken a back seat to real action & suspense.  I recommend any newcomers watch the first 4 episodes of season 1, and then skip EVERYTHING up until season 2 episode 8 \\"Nebraska\\".
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Didn't think it would be that fun at first but then got really into the game as well as the graphics. Definetly would recommend.

1401207529|5.0|There exists no proper description that can give one the true sense, the excitement that this book entails. By far, one of these best Batman stories ever told. Something to be expected from now legendary writer and artist, Frank Miller. Anything written by Frank Miller (more often than not, Batman related), I would highly recommend.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Perhaps not quite as monumental as In Absentia, but an excellent album nevertheless. I think everyone who likes In Absentia, The Incident, Fear of a Blank Planet and in general Steven Wilson output from the 2000's wouldn't regret investing into this CD ... I would have wanted an LP, but the price was a little too steep :)<br /><br />A word of warning for those who are entrenched in the early PT world: you might find this album somewhat too \\"commercial\\" to your taste.

B000I9YWDO|5.0|This movie is so funny! The characters are are excellent and  Judge did a great job with the plot too. It shows the epitomy of how office politics exist everywhere in all places people work excellently. The boss is the epitome of a bad boss in most offices, too! You will love this movie, I promise.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This movie speaks for itself.  Having lived in Mississippi for many years The Help depicts life as it was and still is.  The actors were excellent!  Viola Davis who should have won Best Actress this year did an unbelieveable job of portraying a maid in the 60s South.  All the actors did a great job with their accents and dialect.  This is a must own item for everyone.
1612680011|5.0|Out of all the books by Robert Kiyosaki, this is the book I would highly recommend above the others.  \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" delivers the important message about financial literacy packaged in a relatable and interesting way.  Just like other areas of our lives (e.g. spiritual, health, family, etc.), we need to work and master principles to fortify our financial lives.  Whether we know it or not, all of us have a financial live.  It can be in prosperity or in proverty- and everything else in between.  We have to work out our financial \\"muscles\\" just like our physical muscles. Otherwise, we will lose it if we do not use it.<br /><br />The primary reason I recommend this particular book by Kiyosaki over his other financial books is because it does not get into leveraging yourself (e.g. using credit or loans) to make your business or other asset to grow.  Borrowing money (in any form) has a certain degree of risk.  The borrower is slave to the lender.<br /><br />Read and practice the principles within \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\".<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game with lots of games most are simple but still.fun. I like the darts one and also the cutlers.
0525478817|5.0|Labeling this YA lit does a disservice to the spectacular ease with which the author connects with readers of all ages. Yes, there is a teenaged protagonist but the wit and grace with which she deals with her own cancer and that of her support group will resonate with all. This book is not depressing, in fact, it celebrates life in all its inconsistencies.<br /><br />I urge everyone to experience this amazing, entertaining, genius work.
006113127X|3.0|Factotum (1975), by Charles Bukowski (1920-1994)<br /><br />The novel was author Bukowski's second, and it centers on the degenerate life of Hank Chinaski, Bukowski's alter-ego. The story traces Hank as he consumes copious amounts of alcohol, interviews and changes jobs with regularity, either through quitting or being fired--I lost count of how many--and screws women, most of whom are alcoholic whores. A stark review might be: Having to work sucks but it finances the drinking; and women are necessary for sexual gratification.<br /><br />This is not a pleasant book. It describes skid row life around World War II in places like Los Angeles, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Miami as failed writer Hank Chinaski moves from job to job and rented room to rented room, mostly drunk or with a hangover--with classical music in the background. What is pleasurable about the book isn't the story; it's Bukowski's ability to develop the characters and his writing style. The fact that I didn't like Chinaski--but wished he'd straighten out so I could like him--suggests that the author knew how to paint him. Examples:<br /><br />\\"I got into bed, opened the bottle, worked the pillow into a hard knot behind my back, took a deep breath, and sat in the dark looking out the window. It was the first time I had been alone for five days. I was a man who thrived on solitude; without it I was like another man without food or water. Each day without solitude weakened me. I took no pride in my solitude; but I was dependent on it. The Darkness of the room was like sunlight to me. I took a drink of wine.\\"<br /><br />\\"That was all a man needed: hope. It was the lack of hope that discouraged a man. I remembered my New Orleans days, living on two five-cent candy bars a day for weeks at a time in order to have leisure to write. But starvation, unfortunately, didn't improve art. It only hindered it. A man's soul was rooted in his stomach. A man could write much better after eating a porterhouse steak and drinking a pint of whisky than he could ever write after eating a nickel candy bar. The myth of the starving artist is a hoax. Once you realized that everything was a hoax you got wise and began to bleed and burn your fellow man....\\"<br /><br />\\"When I got back to Los angeles I found a cheap hotel...and I stayed in bed and drank. I drank for some time, three or four days. I couldn't get myself to read the want ads. The thought of sitting in front of a man behind a desk and telling him that I wanted a job, that I was qualified for a job, was too much for me. Frankly, I was horrified by life, at what a man had to do simply in order to eat, sleep, and keep himself clothed. So I stayed in bed and drank. When you drank the world was still out there, but for the moment it didn't have you by the throat.\\"<br /><br />A conversation with his live-in girlfriend:<br /><br />Jan: \\"We sat here all day and evening yesterday. You told me about your parents. Your parents hated you. Right?\\"<br /><br />Hank: \\"Right.\\"<br /><br />Jan: \\"So now you're a little crazy. No love. Everybody needs love. It's warped you.\\"<br /><br />Hank: \\"People don't need love. What they need is success in one form or another. It can be love but it needn't be.\\"<br /><br />Jan: \\"The Bible says, `Love thy neighbor.'\\"<br /><br />Hank: \\"That could mean to leave him alone....\\"<br /><br />At a job:<br /><br />\\"I wasn't very good. My idea was to wander about doing nothing, always avoiding the boss, and avoiding the stoolies who might report to the boss. I wasn't all that clever. It was more instinct than anything else. I always started a job with the feeling that I'd soon quit or be fired, and this gave me a relaxed manner that was mistaken for intelligence or some secret power.\\"<br /><br />Later, at another job:<br /><br />\\"...There were always men looking for jobs in America. There were always all these usable bodies. And I wanted to be a writer. Not everybody thought they could be a dentist or an automobile mechanicbut everybody knew they could be a writer....But most men, fortunately aren't writers, or even cab drivers, and some men--many men--unfortunately aren't anything.\\"<br /><br />And my favorite line: \\"Every man is a poet.\\"<br /><br />I liked this book for the reasons expressed, but I must admit I wouldn't want a steady diet of Bukowski. I will read more of his work--in occasional sprinkles, over time.<br /><br />For reference, a factotum is a handyman, a jack of all trades; assistant, man Friday, gal/girl Friday; gofer; or as Wikipedia says, \\"...a general servant or a person having many diverse activities or responsibilities. The word derives from the Latin command (imperative construction) fac totum (`do/make everything').\\"but everybody knew they could be a writer....But most men, fortunately aren't writers, or even cab drivers, and some men--many men--unfortunately aren't anything.\\"<br /><br />And my favorite line: \\"Every man is a poet.\\"<br /><br />I liked this book for the reasons expressed, but I must admit I wouldn't want a steady diet of Bukowski.

0312576463|3.0|I am generally not sucked in by hype. I have no great need to see the latest movies as soon as they premier or view all the films nominated for best picture. I don't have to read the hottest book on the market, right away, so I can talk about it, appearing \\"with it\\" to those into the latest books (particularly a book that our dear leader, Prince Fluffy Bunny, selected as something to read). Nonetheless, I was intrigued by the subject title--how freedom would be treated--and in recognition that Franzen has built a celebrated reputation in literary circles, I got into the queue at the public library, some 260 down on the list, and waited.<br /><br />It was worth the wait...sort of.<br /><br />The New York Times book review of August 19, 2010 called it \\"a masterpiece of American fiction.\\" the Los Angeles Times book review of August 20, 2010 called it a \\"rich and nuanced novel.\\" And the Guardian-Observer book review of September 19, 2010 said it's \\"funny and poignant\\" adding a cautionary note that  it's \\"only trouble is the weight of expectation it carries\\" due to Franzen's prior success in 2001 with Corrections. (In contrast, there are a lot of negative reviews at amazon.com.) I enjoyed the book--it was difficult to put down. Its weird characters and their trials will be with me for a long time. But therein lies the problem: While Franzen uses a lot of big words (a sign that he's \\"literary\\"?), and the interesting device of having one of the main characters use \\"autobiography\\" to carry the story, everyone in the book is dysfunctional. There doesn't seem to be a normal person in it. I know there are those that would like these characters because of their sexual proclivities and their drug use (Charlie Sheen comes to mind). I was left with an empty feeling about them.<br /><br />My publisher had a comment in an e-mail in reference to my novel, (which I'm editing again) that I'll quote--and we weren't even discussing Freedom: \\"...there's a reason why there's so much out-ethics and angst-ridden crap these days in novels....that's what the buying public is picking up (but I wonder if it's just b/c that's what they're fed.) I believe that there are enough decent people out there who want to read decent literature, that I say carry on! \\" Yes, \\"angst-ridden crap\\" is a pretty good description.<br /><br />And how was freedom dealt with? If you're one of those--liberal, leftist, conservative, or reactionary, it matters not which--that think the world simply must be organized into a moral structure that satisfies your utopian impulses, then freedom is something that must be restrained. As if to say,\\"We can't have too many people actually doing what they want and living like they want, now can we? These freedom lovers have it too good--must reign them in to the new rules, organized by philosopher kings of our choosing.\\" So, if this is your basic assumption, there is plenty in the book that will support it--we have too much freedom, which apparently kills a lot of birds.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are one who sees freedom as mainly about sex, then there is plenty in the book to suggest that freedom is good, which is to say that there is a lot of screwing  going on; and even more thinking about screwing. The author does, however, suggest that there are some pesky consequences...because, you know...people have feelings about such things.<br /><br />Franzen never quite says so, but the freedom bit seems to be presented as a problem to be solved and the social forces for \\"good\\" need to solve it--by what? He doesn't say; but he does leave the impression that it must be solved (and we know who he thinks the social forces for good are). In my view, if it's a problem, it's a problem of an individual choosing how one shall live their life. Freedom is like arriving at a complex intersection that you have to navigate your way through knowing full well that you might take a wrong path, but you make your choices to the best of your ability and live (or die) with the consequences. You may have to backtrack and try a different path, if you're able. Not everybody does this well, all the time--a decent balance of good decisions and minor mistakes is the best most of us can achieve. That's not a problem; it's an opportunity to learn who you are.<br /><br />To close, what follows is a poem by Anthony Madrid, who \\"has written a paradox, calls it the paradox of the leash. To solve it, you have to establish who's at the freer end of the strap.\\" Is this what Franzen is saying? Life is a bitch because of freedom?<br /><br />I Have Passed Too Many Years Among Cool<br />Designing Beings<br /><br />I have passed too many years among cool, designing beings.<br />I have contracted their reptile manner in my soul.<br /><br />Last night I lay awake, judging the earth and all its creatures.<br />My dozen angry blood cells were frowning in the jury box.<br /><br />Having nothing to say, I said nothing a long time.

B005M2V2K8|5.0|My seven-year-old daughter loves the Ty Beanie Boos series of plush toys, and especially prizes them for their lovely, big, bright eyes that will melt anyone's heart. Cashmere the Cat is the latest addition to her ever-growing collection and she absolutely adores it! The cat is soft to the touch, and has a lovely pink-accented tail at the tip. My daughter loves the animated feature film, [[ASIN:B0006J28BO The Cat Returns]], and she decided to rename her cat Yuki after the lovely white cat in the movie! This will make a lovely addition to any Beanie Boos collector's collection.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I have been a chess buff all my life, but due to busy schedule, I didn't have the time to play.  Until, I purchased chess free.  I am so happy that I can play chess on my Kindle Fire. The good thing is, the computer lets me win in some of the games. Very happy with this purchase.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|I literally loved the free version. I played the few free levels tons of times, trying to best my previous times. I was super excited to get the pro version but lo and behold, it DOESN'T WORK! Tilt is totally broken on this version.  I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S2 but that obviously doesn't matter since it used to work on my phone and now it doesn't. The developers have broken something.<br /><br />Get it fixed guys, this is bumming me out.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|I have always liked Hook and now I can share this with my 5yr old niece...it's a longer movie than what she usually watches but she stayed with it to the end.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I've been waiting a long time to watch this HBO series and what I could watch of it was fantastic. I found myself recalling lines and scenes from the book. I went in expecting to be blown away and I thought I was prepared for it, but I still found myself \\"holy crapping\\" like the Raymond pizza scene.<br /><br />Now, the caveat is what I could watch of it... I knew I was in trouble when upon opening the packages shrivels of wrinkled paper fell out from some of the add-in package advertisements. The things looked like they were haphazardly stuffed in with little care. Two were alright, just wrinkled up, the other was shredded. Whoopdeedoo though, that wasn't the problem. The first disc had two scratches on it straight out of the box and I prayed it would still play, but at 31 minutes it croaked. I skipped the rest of it and watched the next pretty angry. I checked all the other discs after and they were all perfect.<br /><br />I know it's not Amazon's fault, and I know it's not HBO's fault... But whoever the nitwit was that packaged my boxed set and his/her dumb/dumber buddy doing the QC on the disc need to pay better attention.<br /><br />Five stars still because this show is amazing, the box set itself, very nice. At the price I got it from Amazon - absolutely fantastic. Amazon's cross-shipping replacement policy is great too.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|I always have a hard time writing reviews. I always feel I can never find the words I want to truly express how I'm feeling. This is why I'm a reader, not a writer. This review is so hard to write. Harder than normal.<br /><br />Delirium,  I read this last year. I loved it so much. Pandemonium leaves off pretty much right where Delirium heartbreakingly stops. I wasn't sure where this story was going to go... It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but oh boy, what a hell of a ride.<br />Life in the wilds is no joke, for real. It's not all wonderful like you think it will be when you cross the fence. I expected living to be harsh,  yes, but it was raw. Oliver does a great job of lodging my heart in my throat, let me tell you. There is one particular scene that brought me to tears. I'm not going to elaborate, let's just say as a mother, I was just a mess. You ladies who have read it know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />One thing I loved about Pandemonium, was the corruption. You get a better glimpse into the government and how screwed up it really is. Second thing I loved, was how it was written. Then and Now.. Then being right when Lena enters the Wilds, and Now is months and months later after she's acclimated. I'll admit, I was concerned when I heard it was written this way, but it was done flawlessly. Everything just flowed together so perfectly, past and present.<br /><br />There are new Characters. There are a few I really liked, and a few not so much. Even the ones I didn't like much were a great addition to the story.<br /><br />There are some surprises and shocks guys! This cliff hanger.. Wow. I don't know how I will survive a whole year without knowing what happens. I want everyone to read them so they can wait with me. Lol.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three books in just over a week. Loved the characters and would read more. This book may not be for everyone due to the sometimes graphic descriptions. I found myself pulling for Christian, the character you love to hate.
1612130585|5.0|The second book by far, blew me out of the water. Christian went from a mysterious, possibly dangerous man to one that could be the most lovable character I've come across. I don't know whether reading this novel was of benefit or disadvantage to me. While reading, I became a part of the story. I'd often wonder what Christian or Ana was up to while I wasn't reading the book. I fell in love with both characters and at times, I find myself pretending I was Ana, hoping I could be in her position. The way Christian loves her and the point that they find themselves at, by the end of the book, is something I'm sure many women hope for. His forever love for her is majestic. This second novel is way better than the first. I can't imagine not reading this and I am super excited to pick up the next book--as well as sad that it is the last of their love story. The author did an amazing job.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a great follow up to The Hunger Games.  The whole trilogy is amazing!! It's definitely a book that you won't want to put down after you start reading it!
0007165013|2.0|It was an okay novel. It was long and drawn out. I was disappointed, overall. I thought it was be something more fun and spectacular. Bad things happened to this girl her entire life. Then, at the end, the story is 100% predictable. Not your average chicklit, sadly. I expected better. I found myself bored at times. And it is very confusing to see all of this email and text messaging going on 30 years ago. Doesn't make sense.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|If you've owned a copy of \\"To Catch a Thief\\" in any format over the years I can tell you right now that you might want to donate them to your local library or just throw them out. Paramount's superb Blu-ray restoration of this Hitchcock classic is what all others will be measured against in years to come. If I could give it 10 stars I would. This is one of the most pristine picture transfers I've ever seen and certainly merits early consideration for \\"Blu ray of the Year\\". The restoration team at Paramount has given \\"Thief\\" a high Bitrate(38.00) and they deserve the highest praise possible for bringing back all the brilliance of this Hitchcock classic. The film won a 1955 Oscar for Cinematography(Robert Burks)and this blu-ray edition brings those beautiful colors back and then some. Greens, yellows, blues, whites and reds just jump off the screen. Check out the flower market scene as well as the costume ball at the end of the film and you will be astounded. And the French Riviera has never looked more beautiful in this blu-ray transfer. In fact, after I watched the film a second time I wanted to book a flight and head over there. Hitchcock made eleven films in the decade of the Fifties starting with \\"Stage Fright\\"(1950) and ending with \\"North by Northwest\\"(1959) but the detail on this Blu-ray release is just eye popping. Cary Grant had just turned 50 when he made \\"To Catch a Thief\\" and he looked great. Trim and fit with not an ounce of fat and with a deep tan to go with his good looks. There is a scene on the beach after he goes for a swim and you can almost see every hair on his chest, that's how pristine this blu-ray transfer is. Not to mention Grace Kelly. She had a lot of freckles. The ones on her face were covered up with make-up, but you can clearly see the ones on her chest in the scene she has with Grant when she wants him to look at the necklace she's wearing. I missed the necklace and saw the freckles instead. That's the brilliance of this blu-ray. The only disturbing part of the film(and this is minor) is the scene with her driving fast in a sports car with Grant as her passenger along the winding roads of Cannes. Considering that she died in a car crash on these same roads in 1982 at the early age of 52, was somewhat unnerving to me. Who could have known. She was a beautiful woman and a very good actress. She made eleven films between 1951 and 1956 before retiring to become a real life Princess. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were a class act something that is solely missing in today's film stars. \\"To Catch a Thief\\" on Blu-ray is highly recommended. Buy it!! And many thanks to the great restoration team at Paramount Home Video.y disturbing part of the film(and this is minor) is the scene with her driving fast in a sports car with Grant as her passenger along the winding roads of Cannes.

B007B6T3K4|5.0|This cd is amazing. To me it is a combination of Epica and Nightwish. Yes, they are similar but this brings Tarja vocals to a very symphonic oriented metal. I am so happy I saw a review for this cd and checked it out. If you are a fan of symphonic metal you will not be disappointed! The only other thing I would say about it, is this cd feels more guitar heavy than Epica or Nightwish. Not that they don't have it but I notice big rifts in here.

It is so rare these days to see a strong woman who is in charge of her career. Madonna knows what she wants and isn't afraid to express how she really feels whether people like it or not. Truth or Dare contains lots of great music and performances. I highly recommend this dvd to everyone who loves great music and strong women. Madonna is so awesome. She is extremely talented and it shows in this great documentary of her Blonde Ambition tour.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|A couple of weeks ago I didn't know what Game of Thrones was. I picked up Season 1 the day that it came out and my boyfriend and I started watching one episode every night starting that night. (As I write this review I still have two episodes to go!) Oh wow I am now such a huge fan- and I am even going to the exhibition in Toronto next weekend. I'm not at all (AT ALL) into fantasy I am a 28 year old who prefers 'chick flicks' and girly shows and yet Game of Thrones still completely appeals to me.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, I feel like I should tell you first that you need to just keep looking for something else if you don't want violence. The series is incredibly violent. The sex and nudity is full and graphic- this is HBO! There will be sex scenes that don't hold back! And the language is strong too. This isn't a show to watch with your kids or buy for your Grandma. It's extremely mature. (And yet- the mature themes in the show don't make me too squeamish although I have looked away before particularly bloody moments!)<br /><br />The story is SO GOOD! The acting is SO GOOD! Peter Dinklage is such a great actor he plays a character that I find myself rooting for despite his many faults! I am obsessed with how he portrays his character! The acting is so excellent, so believable, great, great casting! This is something to get engaged with and to de-stress after a long day with. This has a little something for everyone.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you let yourself get into this series and become its newest fan. I have only watched the commentary on episode 1 but it was excellent and I plan on watching all of the commentary.<br /><br />To be honest, I worried this series would be too boring since it's not my typical taste but it is ANYTHING BUT! When we watch an epidode we turn off all the lights and you just forget about everything else for an hour. I can't even eat when I watch it because it would be too distracting and I don't want to miss a thing! lol I love to love my favourite characters and hate my least favourite characters! You will too!

B004SKJTY6|5.0|The acting was fantastic; the story line strong. It is WWII with Hitler invading various European Countries. England is at risk and targeted by the Germans. The current Kind of England, Edward III is a cad and  decides to abdicate the throne for Mrs Simpson. The throne is passed to the next in line, Albert (who took the regal name George VI). Albert had a serious issue with studdering. He learns to deal with his disability in an engaging and interesting way. Highly entertaining. I recommended this movie.

I found a free app that does everything this one does, plus it automaticly formats the size of the boxes to fit the text and size of paper.

B000CNE092|5.0|I ordered this dvd not sure if it was going to be of a good quality.  The price was right with free shipping included.  My package arrived promptly and packaged carefully.  The movie was in original packaging and was perfect.  Its hard to find some disney movies at a good price and I was very happy to find a place that I can now trust.  Will be ordering from them again.<br />Very important movie in my now grown childrens life.  Brought back very happy memories:)<br />Jules
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First, to those that are offended by the BDSM, it is VERY clearly mentioned in the book description that there will be some of that, and yes, there is plenty. I personally don't practice that lifestyle but despite that I was not at all offended by the book. As someone that enjoys learning about different lifestyles this was definitely a learning experience.<br /><br />The love story between Ana and Christian is amazingly raw and full of life and wonder and amazement. I am sure every woman would long to be loved that way (perhaps without the use of the whips and cuffs). It is an incredbly well written book. I have only just finished the first one (in two days because I couldn't seem to put it down) and just ordered the other two. At no point did it seem inappropriate, granted I am 32 years old and have experienced life. If I had a teenager I wouldn't let her read it by any means, but for the more experienced age groups I think this is a fantastic read. I highly suggest you read it, and take it for what it is. An adult novel. There is supprisingly not much swearing...but I suppose that all the BDSM makes up for it! I nominate this a MUST READ.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|If you're any type of Star Trek fan as I am, then this is a \\"must have\\" for your collection. Really enjoy seeing how they filmed the S/Fx and the behind the scenes!!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I had not watched it in quite a few years.  There was a lot about the movie I did forget like the fight scene in the \\"Kitchen\\" and the scene on the Balcony (towards the end) with Kevin & Whitney.  Thank you much for the movie, it arrived in very good condition.  One of the many movies I will treasure!
1612130607|5.0|I have just finished reading All three books. Absolutely loved them. I found nothing offensive about any of these books. I have recommended these books to my family and friends already. They are just really good love stories. I hope the author writes more on the \\"Grey\\" series. The subject matter my not be someones cup of tea and you may not want to read them. I'm going to read them again and again and again.

B005TBN3EU|2.0|Two stars is really to generous!  I think this is one of the worse sequels ever.  It brings nothing new to the table.  Talk about a pitiful sequel.  They didn't even bother to write a new story.  It is basically the same story minus the humor.  It is so bad.  I don't think there is a single scene as good as one in the first movie.  I also wonder why no bad guys in the movie were Thai only foreigners as they call them in Thailand.  If you've seen the first movie,  I'd say this movie is a 1 star.  If you didn't see the first maybe you could give it a 2 stars, because it may seem a little funny.
0307352145|2.0|There are several books on this topic listed on Amazon.  I haven't seen one yet that I found impressive.  In my opinion, C G Jung, who invented the disnction between extraversion and intraversion, and went on to develop a theory of types based on that distinction plus a theory of four psychological functions, and the Meyer-Briggs and &#34;Please Understand Me&#34; people who popularized the theory, covered this topic very well.  Certainly there's more that can be added, but I don't undersetand writing a whole book about introversion and not covering the rest of Jung's theory of types. Jung developed the concept of introvert/extravert to explain to himself the differences between himself and Freud; in his work after that, he came to realize that that wasn't enough, so he went on to develop the theory of the four functions.  I think anyone interested in the topic should read Jung, or at least his popularizers.  Evidently, people have heard of introversion, tend to equate it with shyness or social awkwardness, see it as a problem, and want help with it; but they aren't aware of the existence of the functions of intuition, sensing, thinking and feeling (as defined by Jung).  I would hope that that would be the least that a book on introversion would do, to introduce these concepts, but noooo....  I reviewed one of the other books on the topic, and while 60% or more of the readers found the review helpful, a few people gave me serious heck for daring to criticize that book, for suggesting that it should have covered the basic information on the topic, and for including some information myself.  Years later, I was still catching flak--only from a few people it's true, but I finally had to stop following that discussion.  I see some of the same going on here; this book is not as bad as that one, but has the same problems, and like that other book, it has gotten lots of glowing reviews, and the few critical reviews are subjected to criticism.  Here are the problems I see with this book, and apparently most of the others:  --There's not much solid, useful information, and the basics are not covered.  Intraversion/extraversion is only part of the story.  If you're an intuitive introvert, for example you may have more common with an intuitive extravert than a sensing type who happens to be introverted.  There are also degrees of introversion and degrees of the other characteristics.  Of course, Jung's theory is not necessarily the last word on the subject, but it's pretty much the first word, and most of the ones in the middle, and you really can't do the subject justice by just taking part of his theory and ignoring the rest.  --The popular books on this subject, at least the ones I've read lately or seen on Amazon, are &#34;self-help&#34; books.  They assume that introversion is a defect or a problem, and try to help you feel better about yourself. It's true that some people, especially those with rare types like the Meyer-Briggs types INFJ or INFP, have problems associated with their type, and learning something about these matters can be a big help.  That certainly was true for me.  Just being an introvert doesn't make you that rare, though, and isn't necessarily such a huge problem, or even a problem at all.  There's no need to whine about it, or to be told &#34;there, there&#34;, for a whole book. This book, on the whole, seems to assume that introversion is a problem, and much of the book is about how to deal with it, mostly by sucking it up and acting like an extravert.  There are some good points made in the book; for example, that shyness and introversion are not the same thing.  Shyness is painful, introversion, not necessarily.  Shyness is a disability, introversion, no, or not necessarily.  The point I'd want to make though, and this again is Jung's discovery, is that if you're an introvert, you tend to get in trouble when you act like an extravert, or you're expected to but you don't know how-- and vice versa.  If you're anintuitive type, it's your inferior function of sensing that tends to let you down or get you in trouble.  Everyone has some introversion, some extraversion, and some of each of the four functions in their makeup.  We tend to be better at, more conscious of, more identified with, certain aspects of our personalities.  It's developing, bring to awareness, the most unconscious parts that really yields results.  Suppose your type, introvert or extravert, thinking or feeling, sensing or intuitive, isn't a problem? Is there any reason then to be interested in this topic?  Well, yeaahh--The Keirsey book is called &#34;Please Understand Me&#34;.  Understanding your own type, and other types, and how different types interact and communicate, or don't communicate, it's just kind of interesting, isn't it?  And it can help us function better, understand other people better, without having to come from a ground of being defective.  We can, maybe, be happier and more productive, even though we're okay to start with.  Jung's concept of individuation was inextricably tied up with his theory of types.  One of the main things you need to do is identify your inferior function (for example, I'm an extreme intuitive, so intuition is my superior function, and sensing is my inferior function), and that's what you need to work on.  I suggest that developing your inferior function is much more important than worrying about being an introvert-- whether you want to become more of the person you can be, or you just want to get fixed. --There is some rather questionable neuroscience in this book-- unsupported, of dubious accuracy, and irrelevant anyway.  Even if it were true, say, that extraversion or introversion has something to do with the amygdala, or how you process dopamine, so what?  How do you translate that into understanding of your own personality, or into action? --There's quite a bit of American history in the book, which I find interesting, but the history is only a little more impressive, and probably no more relevant, than the neuroscience. --There's a section, supposedly one of the &#34;parts&#34; of the book but actually containing only one chapter, enitled &#34;Do all cultures have an extravert ideal&#34;?, but it don't talk about all cultures.  It talks about a few Asian-Americans in the Bay area, in general or anecdotal terms.  I guess the answer to the question is &#34;no&#34;, since Finns  and Scandinavians are notoriously introverted, and then there are those Asians; but it doesn't really talk in any detail about any introverted culture; it's mostly just buying into the idea that this culture is extraverted, and being introverted is a problem.  The theory of types, particularly as popularized in Keirsey's &#34;Please Understand Me&#34; and the Meyer-Briggs test, is something very interesting, and potentially very useful, for a lot of people. (Some people don't get it, or don't like it.  People who are pretty much balanced in extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, etc. tend not to understand what's being talked about; sensing types tend to hate it.  To me that's evidence for the validity of the theory: it can predict who won't like it)!  But the theory of types is not everything, and it's not that simple.  It's worth studying if you're interested, but I think you no need to go into it deeper than this book does.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Sturdy but not bulky. The stand is reliable, if you have your fire set on a table or other flat surface you can use the touchscreen without knocking it over. Inside of the cover is a soft felt-ish material, and there's a black elastic band that you pull from the back to wrap vertically around and keep the cover closed (like the ones on some journal books). With this cover on I'll throw my Fire in my backback, full of books and a zillion other things, and not worry about it getting banged around in here. I've been using it for about a month without any complaints.
098478280X|5.0|This is NOT a coding review.  However, as a Computer Engineering student, I found that it offered really awesome concept review.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting some money together and ordering it from Amazon; a friend of mine lent me a copy of it, and I just absolutely LOVE it.  I'm currently in my second round of interviews for my dream job - and honestly, this book really gave me the confidence to pull it off.<br /><br />Even if you have to borrow a copy to \\"try\\" it, I seriously recommend it to all of my friends/classmates who are currently in the interview process.<br /><br />My Breakdown:<br /><br />Pros:  Great general concept review!  If you haven't coded in a while, or (like my university) you found that you didn't get much of an overview for a certain concept, then this book will show you algorithms and solutions to questions that you Need To Know.  Very practical and otherwise easy to navigate.<br /><br />Cons: I think it needs some sort of reference section.  I realize that it isn't a reference book, but seeing as it appears to be more of an overview for what you Need To Know, I found that most of my review came from looking at the solutions in the back of the book to brush up on concepts I hadn't formally been introduced to or that I'd forgotten.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Don't get this if you are just looking for a time waster while waiting<br />in the doctor's office.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|It serves its purpose nicely. Not really anything to complain about. The price here was the cheapest I was able to find it on the internet.
0385534639|3.0|The descriptions in this novel are quite magnificent and there is no question this author can really write.  The concept for the story is fascinating, and this book promises so much, but delivers significantly less. Quite frankly, it was disappointment.<br /><br />I kept waiting for the storyline to go somewhere, waiting for emotion, conflict, things to happen that would make me want to turn the page. But it was painfully slow. Normally, I would have not even bothered continuing with it. However, the concept was so great and the descriptions so wonderful, I decided to persevere and hope something would finally happen (something more dramatic and interesting than two characters circling each other), but nothing really did.<br /><br />If you love gorgeous descriptions, dazzlingly beautiful writing, and a book that moves at a snails pace (and never really picks up), then get this book.<br /><br />The stars I have given it are purely for the gorgeous way in which the author writes and the fascinating concept.<br /><br />I hope this writer gives her characters a bit more 'punch' in future books and picks up the pace... a lot!
B006OAB3ME|3.0|This is a nice (not great) album, with a very good selection of titles, but not really Paul's strength or best work.

B005Y423ZC|5.0|I've only actually watched the DVD once, but I've listened to the CD more times than I can count.  Both are simply amazing.  I've read some \\"professional\\" reviews that say she missed some notes and was a bit \\"off\\" a few times...I can't hear it.  She's at her best when it's just her voice and the piano.  Seriously, some of those songs gave me chills.  I can see why more than a few people wept, her voice is that beautiful, and so full of emotion.<br /><br />I ripped the CD into mp3 (high quality, 256+), and if it was possible to \\"wear out\\" an mp3 file, I would have done it.  Here story-telling on the DVD is great.  It's like she had 5,000 of her closest friends over to her flat for a private show.  I do agree with other reviewers that warn about letting your children watch the DVD, she does swear like a truck driver when she gets going.  However, unless your kids have never left the house or have virgin-white ears, it's not like they've never heard an f-bomb dropped before watching this show.<br /><br />She is an English national treasure.

1451627289|4.0|The book was exhilarating, and a good thing the underlying story of Oswald acting alone was also fiction! Then I got to the end and Stephen King has to spoil everything in his final \\"Afterword\\" where he says, \\"After reading a stack of books and articles on the subject almost as tall as I am, I'd put the probability [that Oswald acted alone and was the lone gunman] at ninety-eight percent.\\" I'm no conspiracy theorist but there is so much out there that calls into question the Warren Commission's conclusion (which is the same as King's), and most of those arguments claiming the commission's report was a cover-up are right there on Amazon in numerous books.

Mac Wallace, whom Estes describes as a \\"stone killer\\" with a communist background, recruited Jack Ruby, who in turn recruited Lee Harvey Oswald.

She was one of Johnson's lovers during his Senate career and later. On 24th February, 1992, Brown gave an interview on the television show, \\"A Current Affair.\\" She stated that on 21 November, 1963, (a day before the JFK assassination) she was at a party at the home of Clint Murchison. Present were Dallas oil men (including H.L. Hunt), FBI and CIA leaders J. Mc Cloy, J. Edgar Hoover, and Clyde Tolson, Richard Nixon, George Brown of Brown and Root, and Jack Ruby, and mob bosses. During the party these men were drawn aside to a private meeting to be given the outline of the assassination of President Kennedy the following day.

He said a topic of discussion was the political futures of Hoover and Nixon if JFK were assassinated.

He thought the CIA's main reason for going after Kennedy was that JFK was working with Robert McNamara to reign in the agency.    \\"The Zapruder Film\\" -  [...]  This shows Kennedy clutching his throat as a shot from the rear goes through his neck.

0385535139|1.0|As a lawyer and generally a fan of legal fiction, I read Grisham's first few books and enjoyed them, but stopped reading them when he became preachy and a crusader.  Most recently I had finished all of Michael Connelly's books and needed something to read.  I somewhat reluctantly gambled on Grisham's newest.  OMG!  What trash.  I can't believe that an experienced novelist wrote this.  In fact I doubt if Grisham even read it.  If he did he would be embarrassed.  The book is boring, the characters flat and uninteresting, and the dialogue vapid.  If I can save you the money I will have done a service.  This is pulp at its worst.

I have found I like the winning deal and then the abiliyt to see how my score compares to the scores of others.  Totally addictive!
0596805527|5.0|Keep in mind I'm writing this review and I'm only 70 pages into this monster (plus some random skimming)<br /><br />This book seems to be highly recommended by all the big and well known names in JS Development.<br /><br />Having worked through a few substandard JS books (which there seems to be plenty of), I decided to spring for it.  I'm blown away with how comprehensive this thing is.  I wish all my college textbooks were up to this standard.  It's true that this isn't for someone new to programming, or even someone new to JavaScript. [I found \\"Eloquent Javascript\\" (which is a free online book) to be a good starter book.  I say this after having looked at the head start book (complete rubbish) and Wrox's Beginning JavaScript (crap).]<br /><br />Anyway,it's dense and not something you're going to get through fast.<br />I'm taking the approach my Calculus Professor recommended for 'reading a math text'.  You read a math text with a pencil and paper.  When presented with a proof you should work through it step by step with pencil and paper so that you can see the logic behind it, then try it out with some examples.  Well, instead of pencil and paper I have my laptop next to me with the cloud9 IDE up (a great and simple browser based editor I'm growing fond of). As each new concept (at least, each concept that is new to me) is presented I try it out on the editor and print the output to the console. As I work through it and grasp what it does I \\"poke it with a stick\\" by trying some different things with it.  I already feel like I have a better grasp of the basics then I ever did with my previous experiences.<br /><br />I'm sure this book isn't perfect...I don't think that's possible in the world of technology books.  But it's substantially higher quality than many I've read including $180 college texts.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book is funny and serious at the same time.  Great read and the best Grisham I ever read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just came across this book one day on my kindle. So happy I did. Once you start reading you won't be able to put down. Don't waste time trying a sample on the kindle .. Just buy it.

0553801473|5.0|I see why people disliked book 4; it was in truth very slow on the plot and quite boring as times. However, this book starts off very good and keeps on going. It was like I was reading book 2 and 3 again. I don't see why people are slamming it.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great story! More of a young adult book, but I wanted to read it because of the movie being out.  Very well written and I cried like a baby at the end.  Very moving ending.  Well worth reading!!
B000JMLFLW|4.0|Pride & Prejudice is of course a classic in English literature, so in itself it needs no review. However, I want to compliment Amazon for its free library of such titles. That people can access them simply and at no or next to no cost if a real benefit!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Its not awful it is a awesome game i love this game so much i mean i can play this al day!
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|My 8 year old son loved this movie in the theaters so I decided to buy it for him.  The story line has mystery, excitement and adventure.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a very addicting game. Sometimes it dosent sync right but it is fun to play. Try it out for your self.
1594132666|3.0|Too bad, this self-actualization memoir is overloaded with way too many overly long and tedious passages about self-discovery. Whenever Gilbert drops that filler and tells her story straight, I got back into it. The other stuff just made me glaze, so I had to skim a lot here. I have come late to the party about this Oprah book, not even having seen the movie, yet. So I didn't bring any conceptions with me. Gilbert is a decently ironic writer when she sticks to her actual story about her divorce, and subsequent trip to Italy, India and Bali where she ends up with a 52-year-old Brazilian guy. The Indian section is, by far, the weakest, aimed at the \\"pray\\" part of the story where she learns to meditate to a guru etc. I thought I was back in 1968 with the Beatles and Mia Farrow for a second there. The \\"eat\\" Italy part is good when she describes the food, and the Bali \\"love\\" section is good at explaining the quirky Balinese culture. Actually, Gilbert herself is the least interesting part of her memoir, which would have been better as a travel book.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is worth the price of ninety nine cents.  It is simple, addicting and fun.  A great choice for those who likes physics based games.  This is not angry birds but much more fun in my own opinion.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is probably one of my most used apps on my Kindle Fire, sure beats all the scraps of paper I used to have hanging around. However as my collection of notes increase, I want to make sure they are. backed up somewhere. It says they are being synched... but where?<br /><br />UPDATE/EDIT<br />I just purchased a new 8.9 Kindle FireHD. I moved a few of my games and was disappointed (though not surprised) to find levels and scores achieved on the old Fire were lost and I had to start over.  I was really bummed about ColorNote as I had so many things saved on it. I figured I could always email myself the most important things, but it was going to be a pain. Imagine my DELIGHT to find that it had been syncing to my Gmail account all along - even though I was unable to see it. When I added the App to my new Fire HD, all the notes came with it.  Yahoo! Doing a happy dance. Even better, notes added to 1 device update to the other (you seem to need to use the sync button after posting new content you want shared for best results). Super handy as someone mentioned if you maintain a grocery or errand list on it, your spouse or other family members with the app can add to it.<br /><br /> I just discovered it has a calendar too!  AND - using Bluestacks android emulator I can see & add notes from my computer as well. : )
1589946634|4.0|This game is great for a solo experience. It has good replay value especially if you have all the expansions available. I'm always looking for a good game to take traveling and this fits well. But what is also nice is that I can play with friends and it is pretty easy for them to pick it up since it is co-op. I would recommend this to any sci-fi fan that enjoys solo card games.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay is the third and final book in The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins. President Snow is as vindictive as ever and is determined to break Katniss at all costs. Katniss has been pushed into the position as the Mockingjay; a sign to rebels throughout the districts to stand up against the Capitol. But Katniss is on the verge of breaking due to the terror that is being placed on Peeta after being captured by the Capitol.<br /><br />In book three, we are able to learn more about Gale and what drives him - specifically his attitude towards the Capitol and his willingness to harm innocent lives that get in his way of bringing down the Capitol. We also get to see even more of Peeta's character and see exactly the lengths that he will go to in order to prove his love to Katniss.<br /><br />I'm finding myself having mixed feelings about the final book. Katniss flips back and forth so many times that it tends to be confusing. Admitting that she has feelings for Peeta and can't live without him one moment and then wanting to shoot an arrow through his heart the next. She does the same thing with her feelings for Gale. I was happy with the epilogue although I wish it would have led up to the end result in the last few chapters instead of just diving into it in the epilogue.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|A wonderful fun and addicting game. A great way to kill time when traveling for business. The different style of levels give you lots of reply potential.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It isn't the first time that stories or movies have revolved around the idea of throwing people into an arena to fight to the death. Watching people battle to survive for entertainment has happened several times throughout history. The Hunger Games is no exception. Every year one boy and one girl is chosen from each of the twelve districts to fight to become a victor. After her sister's name is selected, Katniss Everdeen volunteers herself as a tribute to protect her sister.<br /><br />Although her intentions are good and it appears that her heart is the in the right place, I found myself slightly irritated by Katniss. Sure, her heart was in the right place to protect her sister and that was noble. But there are others around her that are doing everything they can to protect her but if she isn't let in on the plans (for her own good) she gets hostile when she should be thanking them.<br /><br />Out of all of the characters, Peeta is the one I loved the most. He has been watching out for Katniss her entire life, falling more in love with her as the time passes on even though she pays him no attention until after both are tributes. Once in the arena he is still watching over her, risking his own life. His heart and soul are golden and it was nice to see such an amazing character within the story.
B0009HLD0K|4.0|Breaking Away is a great movie, well acted, and captures the atmosphere of growing up in Bloomington, Indiana, in the 70s.  The final bike race is still going on today at Indiana University.  The only drawback to this is the poor video transfer to DVD, very grainy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is book two of The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Picking up where book one ended, we continue on the journey of Katniss and Peeta as they return home to their district as victors. But just as they begin to prepare to go on the required victory tour, they both realize that they may be out of the arena but the game is still in action and every step needs to be considered.<br /><br />I was glad to see that the stakes in book two were raised and created a deeper plot. Katniss and Peeta are still trying to prove to all that they are in love to try to keep the Capitol's eye off of them. But now that she has survived and returned home, Katniss is struggling even more with her feelings for both Peeta and Gale. However, I still find myself irritated with Katniss. Her actions are not matching well with her words and it casts a shadow on the rest of the storyline for me.<br /><br />I am bumping up the rating for book two because of various aspects. I enjoyed getting to know more about Haymitch and how he operates. Hints about a District 13 were a nice touch as well.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I wanted a leisurely puzzle game, and this was just the ticket. I never played the first one, but this is a lot of fun.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|I see an obvious polarization in the reviews I've been reading. An interesting statistic would be to see the age of the reviewers. Having been born in the 40's (late) this movie hit home. While I was not subjected to the same severity  of treatment I find this to be an accurate portrayal of the times. If you were raised after the 60's this scenario would possibly be very foreign to you. Just as \\"Mad Men\\" would not be the norm for today. The good thing is that times and ideas change. As Emerson said \\"foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds\\".
B006ON41FC|5.0|I LOVE GOING NUTS ITS SO FUN IVE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT PLAYING EVERYONE SHOULD GET IT CAUSE IT IS SO EXCELLENT SHARE YOUR OPINION ABOUT THE GAME TOO

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the game. moving the cards from one column to another is harder than it should be. and if you tap the card it doesn't always go to the column where you want it.

B004WR125O|1.0|I read the manual and went through the installation steps. My wireless router is in the same room. I flashed the receiver to the latest available updates from Onkyo. The wireless receiver would see my network, but would not connect. I did some troubleshooting steps, including making my wireless router wide open, nothing worked. I called Onkyo tech support and we ran through all of their troubleshooting steps. Onkyo tech support said to return the adapter to the dealer. I did so. Amazon was great and had a new one out my house in 3 days. The new one does the exact same thing. It doesn't work. Maybe it's me, I dunno.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game. lots of different options time killer would  be nice if you were able to.unlock levels a little quicker because it gets a little monotonous
B006ON41FC|5.0|Very challenging with different achievements. Must gather enough nuts to buy upgrades and equipment to get far. Watch out owls, trees campers with dynamite, and rotten nuts.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Start the day with reading on my kindle, pick up where I left off later on my phone. Easy to switch between translations.<br />Only slightly negative is the audio if you just want to listen is very mechanical....but I use this app to read only and an audiobook of Bible to listen to anyway.<br />Love the ability to jot notes as I read.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|love the games, but tilt cintrol is broke on ns4g. fix and ill give 5 stars. love the previous 2 games though!
B001FZ0A7W|4.0|I bought this CD for \\"The Ubiquitous mr. Lovegrove\\" and \\"The Carnival is over\\", about the 2 best DCD songs in my opinion. Maybe I should have listened to the rest of the album tough... Not that's it's bad, but there is several songs featuring silly bird noises which are driving me mad every time I hear them (Yulunga, Towards the within... I litterally skip those songs)We're getting dangerously close to New age music here...<br /><br />If you're like me you probably love DCD for Brendan Perry's awesome voice and lyrics more than anything else. So there's about 4-5 songs you'll fully enjoy on Into the labyrinth. The rest of the album is OK, great balance as usual, but overall it's not as good as, say, Within the realm of a dying sun (of course).
B007JRU2UK|3.0|I was sadly disappointed in 'The Descendants' after all I'd heard and read about how wonderful it was and that it is George Clooney's finest acting to date.  I frankly just do not agree.  The film was ho-hum, the acting okay but nothing special.  The storyline reminiscent of many other stories I've seen and read.  I feel it could have been so much more if they hadn't tried to make the entire story mainly about the fact the dying mother had an affair--was the sum total of everyone's existence?  I doubt it.<br /><br />Guess I'm glad I watched it yet wish I'd waited til this one was on the free list rather than wasting $3.99 on it.
B0076R62FM|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. It is really truly funny, with lots of hilarious scenes, has great action, and Rowan Atkinson, who plays his role as Johnny English very well.  It also has a great plot in the story.  I think that this is a really awesome movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a really entertaining movie that will make you laugh.
0307352145|3.0|The contents relay that \\"[introverts]... may be quicker than others to feel sickened by violence and ugliness...;\\" but, in a confusing contrast, the book is replete with a smattering of dispassionate references to select animal experiments, utilizing conclusions drawn from them to make salient points throughout the tome.  For instance: \\"When baby monkeys... were taken from their mothers and raised as orphans-they processed serotonin less efficiently...\\"  Experiments which subject sentient beings to emotional and psychological stress (stress induction allegedly being *the* aim of the referenced \\"experiment\\") are used to coldly and unquestioningly augment the research towards this book.<br /><br />Any work which purports to empower a select (in most cases, a marginalized or disheartened) group of the population ought to be cautious in how it may be implicitly perpetuating or endorsing other forms of abuse instilled deep within the cultural psyche, just as views towards introversion might be.  The subtle message of this text appears to be that sensitivity does not or need not transcend species-ism.<br /><br />As for the main thrust of this book, it analyzes a spectrum of factors: biological, cultural, societal and domestic spheres of influence which may contribute in varying degrees to fashion one's disposition.  Interactions with larger-than-life personalities and coverage of similar events were really fun and amusing to read about.<br /><br />While some may disagree with its broad assumptions or derived implications, it is well worth a read as an introductory immersion into the fascinating topic of introversion and can serve as a valuable segue point to other works, if so inclined.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I'd give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. The footnotes were annoying. That said, I loved the rest.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly my favorite Sophie Kinsella novel to date. It's whimsical and fun, and the romance is perfectly written. I love books where the hero and heroine slowly fall for each other. There's no love at first sight, or instant bonding. They take their time, and we get to fall in love with them. It's amazing how Ms. Kinsella can paint such a romantic picture without very little physical interaction between the two characters. Impressive! This is a keeper.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an excellent book, but I would like to see a new hunger games book. With the same Hunger games but from another tributes point of view.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was perfectly plotted and a brillant author. A must read for everyone 10 and above.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I am a teenage girl, I recently read this book, I am going to be honest my life is a lot worse than Hannah Bakers' was and it made me think about suicide a lot more..... that being said it was very intriging though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow you  are amazing  at writting!!! Im in love with the hunger games  books. You are really talented . Im going to see the movie soon i cant wait. LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!! (: (; (; (;
0061537969|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to several others, as well as purchasing three other copies and given them away.  After reading this book you will never look at dogs in the same way. I am currently reading it to a homebound woman who is 89 yrs old and she is also really enjoying it. She can't wait for our next session. I highly recommend it.
0307956350|4.0|In an attempt to avoid any spoilers, let me just say that The Expats is a smart and surprising novel that consistently subverts the reader's expectations about the spy genre. A fast and fun read. Completely entertaining. Kate Moore is an exciting and unconventional heroine.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|I wasnt expecting much when I started this movie. It was a great surprise. Loved it and have watched it numerous times.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very awesome. They give you chances to get more points by doing certain things. The games cost more points as you increase levels.
1451648537|4.0|To put things into perspective, I have never been an \\"Apple fan\\" and the first (and only) Apple product I have used so far is the iPad.<br /><br />The book tells the life story of Mr. Jobs in an interesting and easy to read style! ( whether it is biased or not  -like some rewievers claim- I cannot judge). Many of the contributors to Apple are described, as well as the competitors ( the only one I knew about was Bill Gates, of course!)<br /><br />A point, the author makes often was the obsession of Mr. Jobs with style and perfection - and with control. After reading this, I saw my iPad in a different light.......<br /><br />Surely Mr. Jobs was a genius - and well written biographies of geniuses are always worth reading.<br />So i would recommend this book even to \\" non-techies\\" like me!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is good for when you are bored. I play it when my child is asleep, when we are on the road, or just when I am killing time before bed.
B004OEJMZM|5.0|This book is excellently written, covering everything thoroughly enough to be used as a solid reference, though organized and presented in a start-from-the-beginning tutorial like manner. It has all the information you need, nothing superfluous, and very easy to take in. A must for any systems programmer.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|A very good game. I highly recommend you getting this app! Lots of options to choose from, and you can also add people to help you manage your own restaurant!
1595827684|4.0|This book is a really fine piece and good source of information how the various concepts in the game shaped themselves to the form we see them in the final product. We get concept art along with small snippets of information for all the major races, characters and locations that have been introduced in the past two games. There are some concepts from the latest game (ME3) which are luckily spoiler free of actual plot developments and shouldn't ruin the gaming fun from anyone. Sadly the book is not as extensive as I'd hoped it to be but overall a polished release for those who are interested in the world of Mass Effect or visual concept design in general.
0143038419|5.0|What a lovely story... I read this dispite reservations b/c my movie club wanted to integrate a book now and then so that we could torture ourselves with the movie after.<br /><br />It was a delightful SPIRITUAL story. Gilbert is brutally honest and raw in some parts.<br /><br />I kid you not, I laughed, cried, then laughed while crying.<br /><br />A splendid surprise compared to the film.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Got the CD shortly after Whitney passed away...I have alot of her music in tapes so this is a good recollection of all my songs in tapes.  RIP, Whitney.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the Kindle that I downloaded from Amazon.com, and I especially love that I could get the Hunger Games trilogy in this format.  I read all three books over a weekend.  What a great read.....I literally had trouble doing anything else but read.  I really do not think that I ever read an author as good as this one.  I am anxiously awaiting the movie and I think from the previews I've seen, that it will just enhance the books.  The casting was as if it came from my head....and that usually does not happen. Absolutely the best read in many years, if not forever.
B000P0J09C|4.0|The movie remains fascinating to watch throughout despite the fact that the plot appears curiously \\"inconsequential\\" at times. Where is this film heading, you ask yourself.......Divided into basically two segments, first we are treated to a tight, yet almost \\"by-rote\\" take on Boot camp. Exhilarating, though, and it makes you laugh at times at the histrionics and the superb command of the Drill Sergeant (who, I believe was a REAL sergeant chosen to act in the film), and almost makes you forget the damage possibly inflicted on a number of fragile young men......which, in fact, is the denouement that powerfully closes the chapter.......<br />Moving on to Vietnam, Kubrick is clearly unconcerned with anything that might even come close to the word EPIC as he concentrates on a small group of men and the growing struggle of their work. It all appears, again, almost breezy and \\"inconsequential\\", yet there is a clear and unmistakeable crescendo that creeps up on you as the movie slowly draws to a close.<br />And it triumphs, again, in the subtlety of the chosen action before your eyes. This is no GRAND, melodramatic \\"Private Ryan\\"......The movie appears low-key but resonates quite profoundly.<br />And so we bow deeply to the many excellent performers (who, please forgive me, Gentlemen, escape me by name), but are CAPTURED literally by the extraordinarily nuanced perfomance by Matthew Modine. The closing scene of conflicted feelings and harrowing decision-making is extraordinary acting.<br />This ending is the more remarkable for humanizing, to an extent, the enemy------which of course is very difficult to achieve, and yet Kubrick offers us this profound observation on the duality and absurdity of war. We are all, after all, at least in a conflict like this, involved in a role which at its most acute moment presents the homogeneity of us all, no matter which side you stand on.<br />The soundtrack is sometimes corny, silly, intrusive, and the Rolling Stones' \\"Paint it Black\\" is the closing \\"memento\\" to this curiously engrossing, unusual, rather unique testament to the futility of war.<br />A near \\"masterpiece\\"------but not quite so......s the closing \\"memento\\" to this curiously engrossing, unusual, rather unique testament to the futility of war.<br />A near \\"masterpiece\\"------but not quite so......

B000AL5OZA|3.0|The only reason to buy this cd is for the extra tracks. It doesn't sound much better than the non-remastered cd version. In fact, none of the ABBA nor the girls' solo projects cds I've purchased sound much better than the original cds that were not remastered. Unless you want the extra tracks on the ABBA and solo girls cds, don't buy them to expect their sound quality to be superior to the non-remastered version cds.

6305128952|5.0|The person that provided the horse training and coaching of the star, Robert Redford in his horse handling for the movie, was Buck Brannaman. Buck is a well respected horse clinician who studied the life work and dedication of helping the horse get a better deal from humans from Ray Hunt and Tom Dorrance. Ray Hunt was one of Tom's better know students and Tom of course is the man (or godfather) who developed the kinder, gentler methods of training the horse widely known today as \\"Natural Horsemanship\\" practiced by many well known clinicians. Although the movie is about the problems of a young girl and her injured horse, along with elements of human trials, issues and frustrations, the kind approach to dealing with the mental and physical issues of the horse come through very clearly. It gives some insight to how trust, respect, love and bonding can be achieved in both animals and humans with a focused kind and gentle method.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|for science related searches, this is great.  when it returns a result, it also  gives you additional information that you would likely also want to know but otherwise need to do more searches on google to get.  and finally, it has its own input keyboard which, for my fingers, is FAR better than the one on my android!

My mother has been living with this for the past 4 years.  This book brought me to tears, espically the part where Alice was giving her speech.  I has helped me understand the horrible affliction that has taken grips of my Mom.  Thank you so much for writting this book. :)

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is actually my first time really delving into the Bible and I wanted a simple way yo do so. I love the Bible app because I can pick several plans yo follow and read about ehkld sharing my favorite verses with my facebook friends. this works wonderfully with my kindle fire.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|It is pretty addicting once you play it. Once you finish it you'll want more levels. I definitely enjoy it.
0375850864|5.0|As a mother who screens everything her 12-going-13-year-old daughter reads, one of my greatest frustrations is when I am given a book titled that everyone thinks is a great read - but not me. \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" by Madeleine D'Engle is one such book. So when we were recommended \\"When You Reach Me\\" by Rebecca Stead, a homage of sorts to D'Engle, I found myself filling up with a kind of dread ... Happily, said daughter is much more insightful than I am, and, not having read \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" herself yet, was able to appreciate \\"When You Reach Me\\" in her own way. I found both books to be similarly plodding, predictable and overly-ambitious, and I feel the same way about \\"The Little Prince\\" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, so the five-star rating is said daughter's. Her review of \\"When You Reach Me\\" follows:<br /><br />\\"The book `When You Reach Me' by Rebecca Stead was a really interesting read.<br /><br />\\"By sixth grade, Miranda and her best, (and only) friend, Sal, know how to navigate their New York City neighborhood. They know where it's safe to go and whom to avoid. But then things start to unravel. Sal gets punched by the New Kid and shuts her out of his life, Miranda's new friend thinks she stole Jimmy's money because she's poor, and Miranda's new friend's ex-friend turns out, contrary to expectations, to be nice. And then she finds a mysterious note: 'I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own. I must ask two favors. First, you must write me a letter.' The notes keep coming, and Miranda realizes that the writer knows all about her...<br /><br />\\"My favorite part of the book was when Miranda's mum won $10,000, and Miranda and her mum's boyfriend, Richard, surprise her by giving her applications to get a law degree, even though Miranda's mum had wanted to spend it on a trip to China for Miranda. It was really sweet of Richard and Miranda to give up the trip to China so that her mum could fulfill her dream.<br /><br />\\"My favorite character was Julia, Annemarie's ex-friend. She was really nice and so sweet, though at first she didn't look like it. I also like how in the ending we find out more about her.<br /><br />\\"I would give the book five stars: one star for the cover, two stars for the plot and two stars for the characters.\\" :-)
B003Y74AXO|5.0|We gave this to a friend for his birthday and he loved it.  I don't own an iPad but I know several people who do and they are addicted to it, carrying it around everywhere.  So something that can protect the screen is a much appreciated item to have.  I can honestly say it makes a great gift.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|The product came extremely quickly and came exactly as described. I had no problems with the disc and I am very happy with it.
0385342063|5.0|I bought this book after falling in love with the book cover at my local target. I then went and researched it on line to see if I would like the story and I knew I HAD to order the book.<br /><br />This book was AH-MAZING! I laughed. I cried. I yelled. I went through every emotion possible with this book. From the very first page I didn't want to put this book down. The storyline is well thought out and Sophie Kinsella had made me want to read all of her other books with this novel.<br /><br />If you want a book that has a great plot, well thought-out and very lovely characters, and a page turner PLEASE pick this book up!!! You WON'T be upset you did!!!<br /><br />P.s. I LOVED the footnotes, it gave something special to the story!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great to kill some time.  Already finished the game, went back and got all stars and all trophies.  Had fun in the process though
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I'm an official at this and like the stunts and graphics and animation and love the terrace in this app &lt;3&lt;3
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I loved this movie. The comedy/horror genre is a balancing act few movies have successfully pulled off. Tucker & Dale vs. Evil essentially did to the countryside slasher genre what Shaun of the Dead did to the zombie apocalypse genre.
B00701897I|5.0|This was a great movie animation was so good I forget it was animated while watching.The action was a little to much is a few scenes but I would rather see it in a cartoon than a regular movie. You won't be disappointed!
B007BDK3SS|3.0|no tilt controls here either. Running on stock ATT Rom Samsung Galaxy s2. Looks like a great game though. Hopefully they will get things sorted out soon...
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of Solitaire has all of the features of the Windows game. I think it is harder to beat than most Solitaire games. I am running it on a Viewsonic gTablet and performs flawlessly. I don't like the ads. between games.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I've been listening to it for a couple of weeks now and I love it.  I really wasn't sure if I would like it or not but I can't stop listening to it.  Classic Van Halen is back and they still rock.  I couldn't be happier.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|FINALLY downloaded and said it installed BUT no updates in the game.  anybody else have this problem?  please help, having AB withdrawals!  Help
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app works wonderful on my Kindle Fire!!!!! I hope that you enjoy it as much as I do.  It is the same one that I've enjoyed for years.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its easy to kill a few extra minutes or play on the go. really enjoy the short games and the variety. needs a fee control bugs worked out, but other than that, its good,simple fun.
1609611543|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. At times it gets a little too technical however I had no idea the transformations that wheat has gone through. \\"Wheat belly\\" has enlightened me on why I have some symptoms even though I have not be officially diagnosed as Gluten intolerant. I would recommend it for anybody who has the desire to learn more about Celiac Disease and how wheat has created the problem!
B001G70M6S|5.0|Works great in my Polaroid Land Camera when considering the common problems associated with this film.<br /><br />As others have noted before, the original Polaroid pack film was encased in metal while this film is housed in a plastic holder. This causes some problems when pulling out the film because the springs holding the film compress the plastic and cause an increased amount of friction.<br /><br />So, just do a web search about this film and learn about how to avoid these problems. I'm just glad they still are making this film!<br /><br />Also, save your negatives. You can bleach off the black backing and scan the negatives or do other artsy things with them!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Before buying this 8 disc blu-ray set of Harry Potter, I saw reviews that indicated it did not include extra information.  I bought the set anyway, since we don't really care about extra cuts, etc.  However, after browsing around, we found plenty of extra information including interviews and cuts.  We are happy with the set - we got exactly what we wanted, which is a complete set of HP on blu-ray discs.  We also got some extras that we had not counted on.  So, all is well.
0525423656|5.0|I Really enjoyed Matched so I knew this would be a hit. All the action events and schemes in this book, I couldn't put it down. Plus the love triangle always seems to suck me in. It is a book that leaves you dieing to know what happens next. I would love to see this series turned into a movie. Great read, especially for the money!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is reply fun but it logs u out trying to get u to get more points 5 stars if it didn't do that
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Freezes on needs and ics.  Needs to be in the notes it does not work. b b b b b b b b bbb
1439116881|4.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't wait to come home to read more.  It was very sad and moving.  Beautifully written.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Glitchy graphics, and grainy images. Other games run much better on my Lenovo K1 tablet. Also my tablet will show a resize icon for apps and such that aren't ment for it, that icon displays the whole time the the game is running.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game!! though its a little challenging to earn nuts for the store. my friends go crazy to play it!! so fun!!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Was very pleased with the actual stage presentation of this 25th year show.  The singers were excellent and watching it from my couch was even better!
B000001FDI|5.0|You can't go wrong with this old Album.  I have it & my son played it & had to have it so I purchassed another one for his Birthday.
B00447G2PM|4.0|I loved the cover of this dvd looks great , was not to much action under the sea I was expecting more, but the 3d was very good
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I am already a great fan of Monopoly and any chance I get I try to play a session with friends. I was in need of a replacement for my old board and when I saw this I knew i had to get it. The product DOES NOT disappoint! The packaging is very neat and the pieces are AMAZING!! I highly recommend this for any monopoly fan and specially for any Nintendo fan!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|love the game got it because it is fun to play it all the time it is so much fun to do so get it ur self u will like it to
B0067Q42BY|5.0|really entertaining,  I get sucked in and lose time whenever I turn it on. the fact that there is a quest mode makes it even more fun!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game cause for me its addictive but it take so long to make but its realistic for time so 5 star people, Add Etanner though plez
0553386794|5.0|Not typically a fantasy reader, I'm more familiar with the labeled \\"literature\\" type stuff, but after seeing the HBO series, I had to pick up the book and see how it compared. In truth, the series follows the novel very closely. Usually this would lead me to become bored with the book, knowing what was going to happen along the way, but I actually found myself anticipating key moments I remembered from the series.<br /><br />Martin's writing is smooth and easy to fall into, with not too much overdone, unnecessary descriptions. His variety of characters, ranging in age, class, gender, and upbringing, add a richness to the book that any reader is bound to have at least one favorite they can relate to or root for (or against). With mention of the expansive cast of characters, that can get a tad overwhelming for someone not used to such a large score of characters. Having seen the series prior, and having a face to place with the name, helped quite a bit to keep names and roles straight, but I still stumbled at moments trying to remember how so and so was linked to whoever - particularly because people have various names and titles they can be referred to at any given point in the book, so remembering one character might also mean remembering his three different names or titles.<br /><br />At just over 800 pages, this novel was a daunting task for someone who usually reads books in the 200-300 page range, but it honestly didn't feel that long. I only became anxious waiting to see the characters further develop and progress through their trials - what any good book SHOULD make you feel. You want to keep going because you want to see what happens next. I never felt like I had to trudge through a bad or boring part to get to the good stuff. It was all good stuff. I'm looking forward to picking up the next book in the series and catching the next season on HBO soon!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Fun movie for the whole family. Was skeptical in the beginning and didn't know if I would like it or not, but I was pleasantly surprised. Good movie to have in the car for the kids to watch while out and about running errands or on a longer trip!! :)
0140135154|5.0|I needed this book for my college English. class and it came on time and is made of a very durable paper which is a relief since my books go through a bit of abuse
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good for a free app, my son plays it more than I do,but like I said its good for a free app
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I was disappointed by this N.S. book.  Very predictable.  Seems like he took some plot points straight from The Notebook & tried to change things around enough so it wouldn't be the same book.  Really didn't fall in love with the characters.  Wouldn't recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game and the app works easily. I like the different options on the cards and backgrounds. I recommend this app.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|Summarize the movie into one word......EPIC! The movie technically is not a sequel but a reboot/re-imagine of the Ghost Rider character. The story takes place in Europe where at first you see the company logo then you see a beautiful helicopter angle of Romania and you see Idris Elba's character riding the motorcycle to his secret headquarters and then you see Carrigan and the movie takes place where insanity is everything and insanity does count in this movie. I can't wait to get this on Blu-Ray so I can watch over and over again.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Great film!  It's, in my opinion, a little better than the original movies.  This is because it explains a little more like where Kirk and Spock are from and how they got into Starfleet.  The other films just don't seem to do that.  It also let's us see the relationships that we're so used to start to form.  The film also explains what happened to Captain Pike in a way that the show didn't.  I mean with the show, we know what happens with Pike, but it's never really explained.  The film also explains how and why Kirk becomes captain of the Enterprise.  I would recommend this film to anyone.  You don't need to be a Star Trek fan or know anything about Star Trek to enjoy this film, but once you see it you'll be hooked.
B000FC13E0|4.0|Big fan of Michael chrichton. Haven't read anything of his  in awhile. Wasn't at all disappointed in this book. Would make a great movie for tv.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|My fellow Amazon'ers...disregard the overanalytical, pessimistic audiophile nerds who gave this two stars. The live disc is awesome and the remastering on the original studio album is good too. But don't miss out on the live disc, if you love live music cd's as much as me and love pf like i do, you'd be shooting yourself in the foot by not getting this.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Thanks for an app that let's me open attachments on my g tablet. I was not able to do that by just going to the website. This app simplifies yahoo mail so that it works on my tablet.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|If you are a fan of Nickelback - this album is a must have for your collection!!! I LOVE each and every song (I cannot think of any song they have released that I do not enjoy). A definite must have to listen to over and over - as the more you listen the more you hear in each wonderful song!!
B0071MV540|1.0|You'll never get the 2 hours back even if you stream this for free on amazon prime. It's sad that they couldn't tell how bad this was going to be while it was being made.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This cd is amazing. Gotye has given every song on there a different sound so you are never bored with the cd. So many different styles to hear.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is so addictive. . Each level is more and more complex and challenging. Absolutely love figuring out the solutions.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|Locks up all the time! Have to use a task killer to stop it and restart.  Otherwise the game play is awesome.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|It has a good build quality and works fine after the setup (what can be a little trick for the first time, specially if you don't have experience with stabilizers), it's similar do the Steadicam Merlin, videos about how to setup the Merlin might be helpful.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|Love this game.  Not too easy and not too hard you can't have fun.  Controls are easy to use and the physics are realistic.
1936891026|3.0|This book is all over the place.  The main premise is that we are all placed on this planet to do \\"one thing\\" and that we need to do it.  We don't do this \\"one thing\\" because of \\"resistance\\", which takes many forms, all of which are trying to keep us from doing our \\"one thing\\".  Pressfield writes in short chapters that cover one topic, giving the book a very choppy feel.  Though I can appreciate the message of this book - go do what you are called to do - I would look for that message somewhere else.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Downloaded the game when it was free and played a little on my phone but after getting the kindle the colors and crisp effects are outstanding. Please buy it.
0596805527|5.0|This book certainly is the \\"definitive guide\\" for Javascript.  A well organized and well written guide as well as a very rich resource for both client and server side JavaScript.<br /><br />(Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book as part of the O'Reilly Bloggers Review Program.)
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I like to think I'm a fine connoisseur of PVZ - throughout my family, we have one copy for each of our PC's(3 copies), one for the PS3, another for the Xbox 360, and finally, another for my Iphone.<br />This one is truly disappointing, it's buggy, the textures look sloppy - not jaggy, I can handle that, but you can see the &quot;seams&quot; from one texture to another.<br />Again, sad, disappointing.  I'm not super worried though, I'll just play the game otherwise.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the games. great games. great freaking games. I love these freaking games. oh and bye the way,  I love these games. I recommend this app for everyone.
B000002JPA|4.0|Dream Theater's second album sees the band considerately sharpening their traditional progressive metal approach, which combines the theatrical thematic portrayal of Queen, the rhythmic complexity and structural dynamic of Rush, a restrained style of Metallica-like speed metal riffing, and the dramatic approach to melodic construction of Marillion to arrive at a distinct sound easily recognizable as the band's own. Typical of progressive rock/metal, this album features quite a few extended instrumental sections during which the musicians display formidable technical skill in complex instrumental interactions, but what sets Dream Theater apart from most is that for the most part these sections are not dynamic diversions from the song's central theme, but elaborations of particular events of that defining theme presented in dramatic form, as part of a coherent development towards harmonic resolution of the song's textural tension and thematic conflict.<br /><br />\\"This world is spinning around me<br />The whole world keeps<br />spinning around me<br />All life is future to past<br />Every breath leaves me one less<br />to my last\\"<br /><br />The instrumentation is of a high level of technical skill, with each member showing excellent proficiency at his instrument, and the band shows understanding of theory application within richly textured and multi-sectioned compositions; these are very skilled players and there are lots of guitar and keyboard solos that occasionally fall into a common tendency of self-indulgence, but when this band is honing in on a unified musical theme progressing toward realization of a song's conceptual culmination, it produces outstanding results in the sheer delight of the technical excellence orchestrated to fulfill these grand designs. To realize these expansive themes of perseverance and hope, Dream Theater structure songs to contrast shades of light and dark, emphasizing the overcoming of struggle through a symbolic triumph of positive change and illumination in the form of ascending melodic guitars and shining keyboards, gliding smoothly over a rhythmic pattern established by precise and aware drumming, and fantastically fluid and flexible bass guitar, working frequent and unexpected time-changes to re-route thematic development in a way that varies a given mood, something that this band does very well: establishing clear and powerful atmospheric mood despite the substantial technical display of instruments and intricate patterns, assisted by a vocalist significantly skilled in dramatic emotional representations of the leading thematic ideas, in the high-register vocal style common to traditional heavy metal as formulated in the 1970s and 1980s, and though he sometimes tests the stratospheric heights of his range with a little too much theatrical flair, his performance intensely enhances the expressive presence and force of the band's music. The disc sounds spectacular and there are a number of inspirational and uplifting moments throughout this album, which is the band's best and one of the most definitive of the style, but might have been better without the tendency to shape melodies in ordinary pop-music styles, which while giving this album a more accessible quality than the average progressive metal affair, also weakens the band's otherwise potent expressive character, particularly in songs like \\"Another Day\\" and some overly sentimental moments in \\"Surrounded\\", but compositions like \\"Metropolis - Part 1\\", \\"Under a Glass Moon\\", and \\"Learning to Live\\" show Dream Theater at their best, offering a variety of diverse stylistic elements while combining top-notch technical musicianship with enveloping atmosphere and pure feeling.
B003VANOFY|1.0|within 3 months of purchase both ear cups have fallen off.  Virtually unusable now.  Had the exact same problem with the wired version of this headset.  Silly me for thinking they fixed.  Last Logitech I buy.
0062082353|3.0|I purchased this book looking for more detailed, technical information surrounding the author's exploits. The narrative contains glimpses into the life of a SEAL both at home and abroad. It was very frank in dealing with the inter-familial issues brought on by both service over seas and SEAL training and the conditions that were found in Iraq and elsewhere.<br /><br />It was an easy read but not exactly what I anticipated.<br /><br />We owe a debt of gratitude to Kris and his family as well as to all of our honorable military personnel.<br /><br />Go S.E.A.L.s!
B007BDK3SS|4.0|This app would be great with a 5 star rating but it doesn't work 100% on the Samsung gs2, their first app works great. This version's  graphics are great, new obstacles are fun, just fix it!
B007BDK3SS|1.0|This is a mobile game on a tiny screen. The physics are wonky and I don't know where the developer got the idea you can bunny hop a dirt bike. Though the game would be fun if we could at the very least skip the retarded levels with no CCCCHHHHEEEECCCCKKKKKPPPOOOOIIINNNNTTTTTSSSSS.
B0071QIN00|2.0|This game is well made but has some glitches that cannot be fixed. I reccomend something else like madden or angry birds. Furthermore I am rating this 2 *s.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This was another surprise gift for the wife that came in on time, in excellent condition and of course a great movie to watch! Only one slight complain, for some reason, the device used to set off the alarms in the store was stuck to the DVD instead of the inside of the case! Luckily for us, it came off with little effort and no marring on the DVD.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This movie will show you how people are able to forgive, forget and love again in a very funny and romantic way!<br />Enjoy!

B0059XTTW8|3.0|\\"He says there's a mole right at the top of the circus and he's been<br />there for years.\\" During the Cold War '70's the head of MI6, Control,<br />retires after believing that one of the four senior figures in the<br />agency was a mole working for the Russians. Because of Control's<br />leaving George Smiley (Oldman) is also forced out only to be asked a<br />year later to investigate and find out who the mole is. This is a movie<br />that I was very much looking forward to. I love all the actors and the<br />idea of it is something I usually like. While this is not a bad movie<br />by any stretch I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I knew<br />going in what to expect and it's not the fact that it's a little slow<br />moving but there was something else that it was missing that<br />disappointed me. I don't know what though. I recommend this, but you<br />must be in the mood for it. Overall, a good movie but for me it was<br />disappointing. I give it a B-.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|installed an update on it today since I was alerted it had an update...open it and everything is the same..no new levels or anything?
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game lots of fun. can play for hours. lots of different cards and backgrounds to choose from.  highly recommand.
B005KELQEU|5.0|It's a great case. Look pretty stylish. However, my only complaint is its a bit of a tight fit for my Kindle touch (still fits) but otherwise great. I don't know why you want want to blow $50 on a casing if you have an option to purchase this one!
B006Z1XY7E|5.0|If anyone has heard Gotye's single \\"Somebody I Used to Know\\" and even sort of liked it, you should buy this album immediately. Unlike so many other artists, Gotye has made every single song unique. Each is listenable and different. As a person, he is amazing. He was quoted on the radio as saying he wanted to be a one-hit wonder; I can confidently say he won't be.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I read the books on this series and enjoyed them, but I really enjoy the movies.  Can't wait for part two of the last movie!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Really enjoyed watching season 4. I think it is the best season so far. Can't wait to see what happens with Jax and Clay in season 5...
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I was one of the believers of the baloney being peddled by the medical profession and the \\"diet\\" industry until I had my eyes opened by this book. I am, by training, an engineer and by nature, a scientist, so I delight in the intelligent use of data and rational thought. This book is the real McCoy when it comes to avoiding popular opinion and thinking for youself. The author's not the first one down this road, but he's the one with the goods. My two children (adults) brought me on board and left me wondering where the medical profession has been, given the obesity crisis in this county. As usual, doctors have to live up to their record of being late out of the gate, but this one's a no-brainer. This book is a five star item in a world full of hurt - a lot of it by people trying to do the right thing.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|What a Let down!! Not at all what we expected.. It had a slow beginning, ok middle and horrible ending! Would not waste time or money to see this movie.
B006IDG2T6|1.0|As with the other 1 and 2 star reviews, I simply find Mr. Harris' work in this book to be lacking in character and honesty.  Free will is a philosophical concept that cannot with such simplicity be dismissed by physical evidence, scant or voluminous.  To put a fine point on it, if the scientific evidence can in fact prove that alpha waves associated (by the thinker) with a given thought precede the thought itself, this still does not disprove the existence of the thought itself as an original creation of the physical mechanism which generated and interpreted it.  Further, to suppose that experience alone negates choice (or personal responsibility for choice) is juvenile.  What, if not the specific physical mechanism of the individual brain can make any interpretation or use of such experiences?<br /><br />I suppose the largest problem I have with Mr. Harris' argument is simply that it reduces all of human existence and creativity down to a poorly disguised game of crooked dice, one which has no creator at the helm (with which I cannot argue) but one that is crooked none-the-less and which can only be blamed upon the cosmos.  The universe is cheating, but we still don't have any choice.  Fate exists, while simultaneously being without source and without direction.
0321784421|5.0|HTML5 is a sprawling mass of open web technologies,the core HTML5 specification alone is 800+ pages. This book picks the eyes out of it. Concentrating on aspects that are most useful and practically important to developers and users. It is successful in this because both of the authors live and breath the open web web technologies that they write about. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to gain a foothold in understanding what modern web development is about today and where it is going tomorrow. I found it to be a rollicking read and would recommend it to anyone except those without a sense of humour.
B005HSL626|2.0|Play this its awesome I love but why cant I get it but I still think it is a cool game I hope you do to because I think it is
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing solitaire and its hard to find an app to please me and I found one. I play it a lot and I'm very happy with the app. yay
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great game, with heaps of arcade games inside. the money system is good, but lower the increasing costs as the game progresses.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Was nice for 30 seconds on my Nexus... Kind of assumed they could could make an app that would work on ICS
B0053TMP24|5.0|this book is one of the best books EVAR!!! spoliler**<br /><br />frank is the best because of his manacial powers of transformation to another living thing. and the plot is very gripping.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|This movie was an OK movie. I wouldn't watch this a second time and some of the products they used were from our time (Ex. Swimming pool with a slide, 12-digit telephone, glass coca-cola bottle, etc).
1609611543|5.0|I bought this book as an eBook and have had to re-read it twice.  I admit, the first time I read this book I freaked out just a bit, but after reading it the second time found all sorts of incredibly valuable information.  I've heard news reports about this book and other reviews have said this book uses no citations for sources of information, but reading the book myself I see now those people were themselves committing falsehoods.  This book details and outlines all sources of information and gives good credible sources for studies, research, and evidence - including the United States Government.<br /><br />I plan on determining if Dr. Davis is in my health network.  This book should be a must-read for everyone who has any concern about what they ingest.  Holistic and organic pesticides and food my left foot - just read this book!  Two weee fks after following much of the advice in this book I am pain free, loosing weight naturally, and have energy I've not had in years.  Who knew it all boiled down to a wheat intolerance (or at least what we now call wheat).  Oh, and I loved that this book not only gives a few alternatives, but includes the website for what we used to use for wheat (actually what wheat used to be before it was genetically modified.)<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book, but don't be surprised if you too are just a bit put-off or scared while reading it.<br />Now I read every ingredient on every label.  You'd be surprised what is in all the food you eat.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|Studying the Shakespeare authorship controversy has been a hobby of mine for years, so I looked forward to the first \\"Hollywood\\" treatment of the subject. Rather than comment on the merits of the movie, which others have done so well, I want to comment on why this controversy is so interesting and, well . . . so controversial.<br /><br />The subject is interesting because it combines history, literature and psychology with a touch of mystery. It combines historical study of the dynamic Elizabethan period with study of the foremost literature in the English language with a mix of biographical psychology. No wonder psychologists like Freud and modern actors and attorneys are drawn to research the authorship question.<br /><br />The subject is controversial because it challenges an orthodox perspective that is supported by academia, tourism, the stage and the publishing industry and threatens a paradigm change that could literally upset the apple cart for a lot of people whose careers depend on the Stratford scenario.<br /><br />For anyone interested in history, literature or psychology, the Shakespeare authorship controversy is a gold mine.
159562015X|5.0|The first part of the book gave me a good understanding of the test.  At that point, you take the online test.  The rest of the book is tied to the interpretation of the results.  My co-workers thought that the test results nailed me.  I would recommend this book to others who want to identify strengths as opposed to the other approach of identifying weaknesses.

B005FVA3LK|5.0|First of all, I should confess- I'm old.  I was there.  I was there for the complete inertia that Achtung Baby represented.  For those of us who didn't hate Rattle and Hum, but contrarily loved it and were eager to see what they would do next, Achtung Baby was as shocking to hear as it must have been difficult to make.  I was initially stumped, confounded, even frustrated by Achtung Baby, but it has since grown into my favorite Rock Album of all time.  And it remains, to this day, one of the best musical discoveries, and musical experiences, of my life.<br /><br />I tell you that to say, I was going to be a tough sell for this box- if only because I snatched up, and still have, every Single from the record, including Imports... and I thought I pretty much had everything a fan could collect, or obsessively hunt down, from that era.  What was a new box going to offer me, that I didn't already have?  If that's you, and I know I'm not alone in this... This box is everything we could have dreamed it would be!<br /><br />I know that's contrary to some reviewers who say that they wish there were more, or different, content.  But I'm prepared to tell you that if you are a die-hard fan of this band and this album, and Rock music in general, the material that debuts here is worth the price of the box, even if you already have the rest of the music.  And, let me say, you didn't already have these remasters- of both Achtung Baby and Zooropa, and also of those remixes and b-sides.  They sound a-mazing.  But there is yet more exclusive material included here...<br /><br />It is:<br />-Some Recent Remixes (I don't recall ever hearing \\"One\\" remixed before now... Covered, maybe, but not remixed.  \\"Real Thing\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" also get updated remix treatment)<br />-Exclusive B-Sides (\\"Blow Your House Down,\\" \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" \\"Oh Berlin,\\" \\"Near The Island,\\" \\"Everybody Loves A Winner,\\" and \\"Down All The Days\\" -an alternate treatment of \\"Numb\\")<br />-From The Sky Down (of course,it debuted on disc here)<br />-Several tracks on The Videos DVD (like the footage from Stop Sellafield) are exclusive to this release<br />-The entire \\"Bonus Material\\" disc (If you're like me, you've only had a VHS of the ZooTV special since 1992... SO psyched to see it here!)<br />...and the piece de resistance:<br />-The KINDERGARTEN Version of Achtung Baby<br /><br />Yes, to me, this latter entry is worth the price of the box, all by itself... even if you weren't getting all that other stuff.  The Kindergarten Version reminds me of what it felt like to listen hard, with famished curiosity, to this mad explosion coming out of the speakers- and, in both cases, then and now, the reward was the same: I was winding my way into Achtung Baby.  For those of us who had the experience I described above, this Kindergarten Version is the closest new experience I could ever imagine having that replicates the old, former one.  It's a really special gift.  I've never seen a band do something like this, even though you hear \\"demo\\" versions and \\"early\\" versions all the time.  This is a true 'alternate' record.  The Achtung Baby that almost was.  The songs are still there, with a great many twists and ideas you've never heard inside those musical frameworks until now.  It may not strike you the same way, if you didn't have the experience I did in 1991-2...  But if you did, this new experience is truly priceless, and will probably bring back those old days for you the way it did for me.  Again- what a gift!  My heartfelt thanks to U2 and their team for not only giving us Achtung Baby, lo those 20 years ago, but also for giving us this celebration bash to commemorate it.<br /><br />Yes, I can agree that my one disappointment was the presence of the Zooropa in Sydney show, sans updates- like a Bluray pressing, or some different bonuses with it.  But then again, the experience is not complete without that perfect statement of all that ZooTV was... And, regarding a bluray, the concertwas shot on video twenty years ago.  Not sure what a Hi-Def image is going to improve, that an up-converted DVD wouldn't approximate.<br /><br />I can see consumers thinking that the Uber Box is only for the truly devoted... But if you fell in love with this record sometime within the last 20 years, you owe it to yourself to revisit that experience with at least this Deluxe Anniversary Version.<br />It's just, simply, the best!<br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />See Also:<br />-The glorious cover version of Achtung Baby by artists like Jack White, nine inch nails, Depeche Mode, and many others<br />-The bluray of From The Sky Down (with bonus features)
B005GRTNVE|5.0|This is Popera, not opera, so if you are an opera snob, go watch the fat lady with the big Brunhilda hat. Popera is a genre in and of itself, and these four guys are the best in the world. They have in fact gotten even better over the years.  I would say they are now at their pinnacle as displayed in this thrilling concert performance.  My fave:  Dov'e l'Amore, sung to Samuel Barber's Addagio for Strings, just brilliantly executed. I have no doubt the composer himself would have been moved by this powerful rendition of his classic piece. And the real crowd-pleaser of the night was Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore, their best-ever performance of this song, and the crowd went WILD.  Buy this DVD, you'll spend many hours playing it over and over.  Destined to be a classic.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A book that will surely become a classic as books that were written one hundred years ago have became today. The hungered games series has just everything you want from a book; action, romance, drama.The Hunger Games captures you from the start; from the moment you are with Gale and Katniss hunting to the moment of the reaping to the games itself to the national tour. Catching Fire is a little bit slower at the beginning but races it's way back to capture readers attention. And Mockingjay, the greatest saga ending I have ever read; perfect from the start to it's sad but legendary ending. The Hunger Games will always be remembered.<br />\\"May the odds be ever in your favor \\"<br />Suzanne Collins

1612130283|1.0|Badly written juvenile porn. Umberto Eco has explained thr difference between porn flics and regular movies. Only in porn do people actually travel, drive, walk from scene to scene. I did not succeed in reading past the first chapter, as this book tells the story exactly in this che&aacute;p porn kinda way, telling every step every move in a stupid factual way. Dssapointed!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Time travel can be a very tricky theme to write about. Stephen King being an author like no other has managed to turn science fiction into excellent story telling with all good elements that has made his previous books so good. Definitely a book to spend time on.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I borrowed this book through Amazon Prime.  The first couple of pages are always the hardest for me to read in any book because I was waiting for something to catch my attention, but by the second chapter, I was  hooked.  I read the book in five hours.  It was a pretty short read, but it was great and I cannot wait to read the second one.<br />I have to say one thing that impressed me is the fact that the book did not need to have sex in it or any bad language to grab the attention of so many young readers.<br />Yes, there is violence in it.  Most definately.  But there is more to it than that. Something readers needs to understand about the POV from Katniss is that at the end, a lot of things she had tried to bury for so long are starting to resurface again.  I have yet to read the second and third book, but I am hoping that a lot more is continued there.<br />I would recommend this for 13 years and up.  If you have a weak constitution or just want to argue about anything and everything, then don't read this book.
B004HW7JMO|1.0|I was extremely excited to receive these DVD's but upon arrival, the disks were so scratched I could not believe it. I ordered NEW not used. The glue they used to hold together the different sections for each disk did not hold together, so the disks moved around and the glue came off a bit on one of the disk making it unable to play. I was extremely disappointed. I just received Blood and Sand today and noticed it is the same kind of box/material/packing/dvd casing that Gods of the Area is in. I still have not opened it to see the result. Also, the Gods of the Arena box in the description says that Disk 4 is Bonus Features ONLY(Extended Scenes/Alternate Endings/Content too Risque for Cable TV, and episode 5 and 6 are on disk 3. On mine, only epsiode 5 is on disk 3 and ONLY episode 6 is on disk 4. But the description for the disks say otherwise. There are no bonus features of any kind on disk 4 or any disk. Not even an option for bonus features can be found on any menus. Overall I was very unsatisfied with the DVD's. I hope others do not received the crap that I did. The show however is EPIC and AWESOME!!!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this app had potential but the games had unrealistic time clock. I ran out of time before I could get more points and that mini game was darts,it lagged which prevented me from scoring fast.an ad popped up,I thought at first it was a mini game,clicked and took me to my Internet browser. all I can say is try it out because its free and see for yourself. who knows maybe you will be lucky and love it. if you find you hate it,well I warned you!
B005G0YP3C|5.0|The 3rd GG album was the 1st produced by the Boys in the Band themselves. It has always had a 'distant - muffled' quality to the overall sound. I've often wondered if that was done intentionally as the work is a concept piece about Memories of Old Days, or if the boys were just on a steep learning curve about producing music?<br /><br />If it was intentional, perhaps it should be listened to as intended. GG was certainly not shy about using gimmicks & effects to convey their musical ideas & concepts. That said, who'da thunk that a 40 year old master tape could sound so good?!?! I have multiple copies on different labels and formats of every GG album. The only one I don't have of 3 Friends is a Vertigo label LP copy. This remastered Alucard version blows all the others away!<br /><br />It's fresh, alive ... it's like you've taken out earplugs and removed the pillows from in front of your speakers! The mix is much more \\"upfront\\". The \\"definition\\" is greatly improved. The dynamics more, well, dynamic! The stereo sound-stage more \\"visible\\", more separation and \\"air\\" between instruments. It really is like listening to a brand new GG album. The only problem I've heard is that for a couple seconds, in a couple spots, tape hiss intrudes a little too much. No biggie.<br /><br />If Three Friends by Gentle Giant is important in your music collection you *need* to have this Alucard Remaster ... if it isn't important, what the hell is wrong with you?

B0055Q5F36|5.0|There aren't many cases out there for the S II - especially since the Skyrocket came out. I used to have a Case Mate slim hard shell case on the phone until it cracked in several places and I had to toss it. I looked around for a few days before deciding on the Otterbox (I had one on my old iPhone and loved it). I was a little worried that it would add too much bulk to the phone as one of the main reasons I bought this phone was because it's got a massive screen AND it's super light. I was plesantly surprised that the Otterbox case was lighter than the Case Mate that I had. It fits the phone like a glove, protects the nooks and crannies from dust and dirt and actually makes the buttons on the side EASIER to push. My favorite part of the case though is the \\"dual coverage\\" with the silicone glove and the outer hard shell. The silicone glove protects from dust, dirt and a little bit of water and the outer hard shell protects from short drops and falls. Best case out there for the S II by far.<br /><br />Oh yeah - just throw out the screen protector though - it's crap, but I didn't buy the case for that anyway.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is my first review.  I have never really felt too compelled to write a review, but, in this case, I surely am.<br /><br />I have not read very many Stephen King books, not because I don't like him...I just haven't.  However, I heard so much about this book and loved the idea of the book.  I couldn't wait to read it.  I told my grandmother (and avid King reader/lover) about the book, too.  She immediately got on Amazon and bought her AND me a copy!<br /><br />We read it together (well, separated by 200 miles).  We started it on a Saturday night and finished Tuesday night.  Work got in my way and her caring for my grandfather are the only things that made us not finish it faster.  SO hard to put down.  So gripping.  King's ability to not only research but then put it all together and bring you into the story is amazing.  I had read some reviews that said it was \\"too long\\" (shouldn't have put so much about Oswald's domestic troubles, etc)...I beg to differ!  It helped you get to KNOW Oswald as a character.<br /><br />I couldn't fall asleep for 45 minutes after finishing this book (which was at midnight).  Very thought provoking.  You MUST read this book!  Even if you don't think you're a \\"King fan\\"!  This is not \\"typical\\" King (relating to horror), but the writing fluency and ability to make you think is DEFINITELY in true King style.

B000MQ54OY|5.0|I already have this film on DVD, but seeing as it's my favourite animated movie I decided to fork out the few dollars and get it on Blu-ray and I am not sorry. As to be expected, the colours are more vibrant, picture is sharper and sound is wonderful. The extras are a little disappointing as there isn't much more than on the DVD but that aside, I am one Happy Customer...
B004LROUNG|5.0|Very good book as one might expect from John Grisham.  Light with a good story line, but captivating.  As usual, I read it within two days of receiving.  I bit predicitable, but very good.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|* Show is great.<br />* Box-set is great.<br />* It's just great.<br /><br />---------<br /><br />The reason I bought season one:<br /><br />DVD sales of season one will contribute positively regarding the production of Book Three. And since it has been said that Book Three will need to be split in two season(20 episodes)... hence my purchase of season one.<br /><br />I personally would like Book Three to be one season of 16 episodes.
0439023513|4.0|Closing a popular series is not easy.  There are always loose ends, the expectation of happy endings, etc.  I think that Collins does a pretty good job.  While I don't think that Mockingjay is as strong as either of the first two books, I do think that it provides the closure that many readers want when becoming vested in the main characters.<br /><br />I will say that this book reads differently and feels different that it's predecessors--just an all around different vibe (I don't know how else to describe it).  Some of the story becomes a bit cliche in parts, but Collins counteracts this with some climactic moments and tough losses. All in all a worthwhile read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the way it looks and feels during play! Easy and smooth like ice cream on the Fourth. Cards snap into place with a tap of the finger. Saves so much time.

B000U55YIS|5.0|Wanted the original recordings which Amazon do not sell as MP3 - only God awful re-recordings.  The very worst thing an artist can do is get back into the studio some 20 to 30 years and re-record tracks.  Lyrics are often sung with a smugness befitting the artists ability and with synths replacing orchestral parts - don't do it!<br /><br />Anyway, this collection of 3 CDs has none of that and is well worth the asking price!
B0073QGIPA|5.0|This is so easy and affordable! It's a great option for those weeks when I miss an episode. Something happens with the picture, though. When I move the picture from my computer to the TV, the actresses all get wider! This doesn't happen when I watch from HULU.
1451673442|5.0|It's funny to me how The Secret, and a lot of the teachers of the Secret threw in Gratitude, as if it's just something you do at the end.  A few people emphasized it, but not nearly enough was made of \\"The Magic\\" which is Gratitude.  NOBODY has a problem dreaming of the big things they want.  The new house, new job, new love, new car.  Nobody has a problem asking the Universe.  Even acting \\"as if\\" isn't a problem for most.  Those are 3 of the 4 steps laid out in The Secret, yet very, very few people I know attracted ANYTHING after watching that movie/reading the book.  Why?  Because the last step, and the ABSOLUTE most important step, Gratitude, wasn't emphasized enough.<br /><br />The Secret book should be edited and re-written, and Gratitude should be the first step.  Because it's FAR AND AWAY the most important.  It has been the most difficult for me to master.  I tend to take many things for granted, so I was sure to get my hands on this book when I heard it was focusing on gratitude.  If you can master the art of gratitude, the other steps in attracting what you desire are a piece of cake.<br /><br />This book is an excellent tool in helping you master Gratitude, the most important step of the law of attraction process.  It's written in a workbook like format, broken down into a 28 day course.  Each day you are to practice the daily steps.  You can of course, skip ahead and read the whole book, but the author demands you do not miss a single day of practicing the daily gratitude exercises.  THEY WORK.<br /><br />It's a shame that some reviewers looked upon this book as re-hashed material.  I'm not sure if they actually read the book, or just heard it was about something that The Secret book touched on briefly.  The Magic is the most important book Rhonda Byrne has put out, and I guarantee it will have more people setting the proper wheels in motion for the Law of Attraction than any of her other previous work has done.<br /><br />5 out of 5 all the way, super highly recommend.  Life changing stuff here, folks.ighly recommend.  Life changing stuff here, folks.
B00005NKK8|5.0|All the songs are classics, priceless, signs of their times, the soundtrack of an entire generation of Americans, who believed-love-gave-and-lost just about everything in 20 short years, and woke up one morning with nothing to show for it, nothing but credit card debt, rude ingrate demanding kids and over-leverage homes, many of them superannuated, out of work, their accomplishments dismissed.  Breaks my heart sometimes to listen to these songs today--it recalls all stars in the eyes of the California Dreamin' 60's--now extinguished.  But what music! And the guts and glory they inspired and reflected.  It almost made it worth it, the attitude, protests, defiance.  Pretty dern near heroic, especially relative the pale progeny that followed them but which hasn't the starch, let alone the interest or wit or grit, to walk that walk or wear those boots.

B004YCKK6Y|3.0|These anthology movies with multiple directors are usually a dicy proposition, \\"New York Stories\\" with Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Woody Allen helming each segment comes to mind.  \\"Four Rooms\\" is no exception to this axiom.  I won't waste a lot of time so I'll nutshell it.  Allison Anders' piece is abysmal.  How could it not be? Madonna's in it.  Alexandre Rockwell's is little better but, then, how could it not be? The best is Robert Roriguez's segment.  How could it not be? Antonio Banderas is in it.  Quentin Tarantino seems to be phoning in it.  He essentially uses this as an opportunity to drink and yuk it up with his buddies, namely an unbilled Bruce Willis.  The verdict is see this for Rodriguez's piece and you might find some minor interest in maybe two of the others.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|I thought this was only going to be a one season deal. Turns out it's a mini-series with an extended life. One thing I don't understand however, and I found it almost irritating was how Brody's wife would refer to Brody AS 'Brody', and not Nick or Nicolas. When does a wife refer to her husband by his lastname?<br /><br />It's like, if she doesn't call him by his surname, we as viewers will forget what his name is. Apart from that, it's a good, well-acted series, with some good subplots.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|Do not listen to the reviewers who say the blu-ray transfer is not good. Are you kidding me? These people must be blind or have a terrible monitor. I also own the DVD Godfather Collection and I did a comparison on my Sharp 70\\" Aquos (which is one awesome looking HD tv) and the difference between the blu-ray and DVD is outstanding! The DVD color is washed out, whereas the blu-ray color is vibrant and alive! I honestly could not believe the difference. It was shocking how bad the DVD looked. I know that regular DVD's can look bad on large flat screens, even with the upconverter players, but this was unbelievable. The DVD was dull looking and very grainy. The blu-ray brings clarity to the picture. I know the DVD probably looks good on a smaller HD tv but it looks absolutely horrible on a 70\\". By the same token, blu-ray practically looks 3D on the newer large screens that are not 3D.<br /><br />There is some grain still on parts of the blu-ray on Godfather 1, but it is 10 times worse on the DVD so I was not upset with that. The movie is 40 years old.....only so much you can do with it, to be sure. Only thing I wasn't so impressed with was the new 5.1 sound....it was a little hollow and needed some bass. Again, 40 years old. Godfather 3 looked stunning, picture-wise, no grain at all.<br /><br />Definitely worth the money if you are a fan. And I'm not sure what all this talk is about it being in 4:3 ratio. Mine was not and the format is not 2.35:1, nor is it advertised as that. It actually just says \\"letterboxed\\". But in any case, the correct ratio for these movies is 1.85:1, which fills a widescreen tv without stretching or zooming. Perhaps the tv aspect was set wrong.

B004UQ03P2|5.0|I initially purchased the Splash masque protector from Amazon and it was sold by a third-party company, I ended up returning it because it was bent during shipping (the company placed it in a soft envelope). I tried flattening it and applying to my screen, but the crease was still a little visible. So... I returned it and got the Moshi iVisor, all I can say is what a huge difference in quality!<br />1) The iVisor is a clearer picture and there is no weird distortion (caused by the matte screen), which is what I saw with the Splash masque.<br />2) The Moshi has a seamless fade from the black trim to clear, so that the MacBook Pro logo (on the bottom of screen) is visible. I liked this because of esthetics and lint/dust does not get stuck on the cutout area. Compared to the Splash Masque cover which had a cutout around the MacBook Pro logo, which frequently caught dust particles.<br />3) The cover fits the screen perfectly on the Moshi. (versus the Splash which had a small gap between the cover and the sides/rim of the screen, this makes a big difference, since after staring at your screen for hours, you tend to notice these small things, that eventually drives you nuts!)<br />So I only used the Splash cover for a few days before giving up on it, besides the cease that was on it, the picture distortion drove me crazy, I would have to move my head to the side to get a clear image (just like you do when there is a glare, on a glossy screen). It really defeated the purpose of an \\"anti-glare\\" screen cover. Overall I am sooo happy that I switched to the Moshi iVisor. I initially ordered it because it was shipped by Amazon, so I knew I would have great customer service, but now I am ecstatic about the quality of the picture. Definitely worth every penny!

B0025KVLTC|5.0|I read one review saying that the Beatles were overrated.To that person and anyone who is naive enough to believe that premise,just listen to \\"Revolver\\". The song craft and production values are so high,it's unreal! Yeah,\\"Revolver\\" came out 46 years ago (as of today 3/16/2012),but how many albums that old can still hold up after that amount of time?<br />As for \\"Revolver\\" itself,it's a continuation of \\"Rubber Soul\\".<br />\\"Taxman\\",\\"I'm Only Sleeping\\",\\"Eleanor Rigby\\",\\"For No One\\",\\"Doctor Robert\\",\\"Yellow Submarine\\",\\"Here There and Everywhere\\",\\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and the instant Beatles' classic \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" for starters.<br />and a totally kick#&% cover to boot!<br /><br />P.S.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I orginally read it because my kids had and the movie was coming out but now I have read all the books and read the first book again in anticipation of the movie.  I enjoyed it...  a little warped by wanting to kill everyone but you soon see the love and caring story behind it.
B004N622EY|3.0|A friend who shares similar interests recommended this book to me, and I was at first encouraged and got into it very easily.  The journey from middle to end however really destroyed it for me.  I believe this is one of the authors books so after I finished it because it had potential and was a new book I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and continue with the series.  That was a mistake and a waste of $15.00<br /><br />Pros:<br />This storyline has huge potential and a very strong beginning, defining one of the main characters as a strong and definitive character.<br />The plot line, at least at first was quite good, and reminded me a little of Lies of Locke Lamora.<br />An original magic system that I enjoyed, the idea of burning metals and each giving a specific quality, huge plus.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Unfortunately the author falls for one of my pet peeves when it comes to story telling.  His characters while at first had strong potential, turned out weak and unoriginal.  Rather than showing you how one might be unique or giving them strong qualities which the reader alone discovers on their own he tries to pin his main character \\"Vin\\" by having other characters repeat over and over again how \\"special\\" and amazingly \\"quick to learn\\" and \\"intelligent\\" she is.  \\"Natural talent.\\"<br />I hate it when authors fall into this habit I really do, and while he at first builds an interesting love story for her it becomes cliched and forced, and painfully see-through.<br /><br />I loved the plot but unfortunately the writing style became so painful to continue I simply could not bare it.  However I would imagine this would be a good book to introduce new readers to fantasy to avoid terribly written stories like twilight.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Had missed a show or two from 2nd series of Downton Abbey and decided to purchase it through Amazon. The price was great, delivery time even better-finished series before PBS finale.

B005CMSDLE|3.0|A stylish, \\"assassin-coming-of-age\\" thriller (and who doesn't like one of those) has the ingredients for a good movie - interesting locations (snowy northern European woodlands, Morocco, Spain and Berlin); talented actors Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana, and fresh-faced newcomer, Saorise Ronin.  The plot, however, fell apart (IMHO) in the first ten minutes, and it was best to sit back and watch Hanna kick ass and run from her pursuers than wonder why Cate agreed to a supporting role ( maybe they let her keep the shoes).  The main problem?  WHY, after taking Hanna into hiding training in survival skills and fighting techniques  for fifteen? years,  (to combat Miranda and the defunct secret gov't prenatal DNA research program that seeks to eliminate her, did 'Papa Eric' encourage her to press the goverment ELT locator button for a rescue (knowing it would bring the very people she wanted to avoid), rather than simply hiking out, as Eric did?  (Wearing, I might add, a suit!  Not his arctic fur garments; a suit, without even an overcoat.  One would have to conclude there was a village close by; if he could make it, so could she, so calling the plane/heli made no  sense whatsoever.  The actors acquit themselves fairly, though Ms.Blanchett's southern accent was, um, unnecessary.  The net effect after watching was that the movie appeared to be conceived as a vehicle to showcase Saorise Ronin.  See Hanna Run.  I did, and she was delightful, as a fresh-faced, unspoiled, virginal assassin.  I just hope she doesn't move to Hollywood and befriend Lindsey Lohan.

0307719219|3.0|While I have an MBA from one of the world's best known programs, I cannot claim any expert opinion on economic development. I am primarily a user, engineer and consumer of information technology and electronic devices.  Certainly the authors who are world renowned authorities on development economics should know what they are talking about and cite many relevant historical examples of successful and unsuccessful economic development. But as a layman I remain skeptical that the openness of a nation's political institutions is exclusively predictive of economic success. I (as a layman) wonder about the continued success of this nation with admirable political institutions but in the process of de-industrialization as against a closed \\"extractive\\" society that builds our IPAD's and consumer products.<br /><br />Is there some experimental model that makes testable predictions and which supports this theory of Open/Collaborative Government as the key to successful development that I and other laymen who share my opinion are missing?

0307888908|4.0|Given the biggest economic downturn of the past 50 years and the simultaneous introduction of internet-based social communications I could not think of a more important topic today's professional as the current means of securing and maintaining successful employment.  Given that the authors are a co-founder and Chairman of Linkedin and an award winning entrepreneur and author I would have expected novel advice and empowering suggestions for successful and entrepreneurial employment and professional communications, and the book offers some of that including the novel notion of the importance of \\"weak links\\" (professional acquaintances who are aware of some of your skills but who can introduce them in new and differing professional environments).  But the majority of the advice offered \\"to take risks\\" to be an entrepreneur and to act as a individual (or personal) start-up and company of one; seems well worn in the current milieu and less than I would have expected by the leader of one of today's best professional communication and business/social networking sites.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read, and the notion of weak links is worth contemplation and execution. But otherwise New/Old Hat.

1612130283|4.0|Would stay closer to a 3.5 star****<br /><br />After hearing the hype and reading the reviews here on Amazon (yes even the 1 and 2 star reviews)- I decided to purchase the book. I am glad that I did, I thought it was a fun and engrossing read. While there is some disbelief that in this day and age that a 21/22 year old would be as naive as Ana about sex/relationships I still found myself routing for her. I guess the author was trying to model her on some of the famous English lit heroines which is alluded to heavily throughout the book.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. The email banter between Ana and Christian. They were relevant to the progression of the story. At times revealing, always witty - they are one of the best things about the book.<br />2. Sex scenes, very HOT! Although I would say that the BDSM element is very lightly touched upon.<br />3. The pacing of the story is good from Ana's infatuation with Christian to their developing sexual and emotional (more on her part though) relationship  - although at the end of book 1 you are left in the middle of the story.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. At times there is a repetitiveness to the writing/grammatical errors that occasionally distracts from the story.<br />2. You don't really know more about Christian/his inner workings than you did at the beginning of the book - most of what does get known is towards third half of the book. You know he likes her, certainly desires her but it always revolves around his obsessive need to control.  I hope this is more developed in the other books.<br /><br />Although some reviewers didn't like the inner dialogue between Ana's subconscious/inner goddess - I didn't mind it. I did go ahead and order the next books in the trilogy.<br /><br />For more BDSM erotica and the psychological aspect of it  I would recommend A.N. Roquelaure/Anne Rice's Beauty trilogy or the classic The Story of O.
B001NLKT60|4.0|The first book in this series seems to get all of the popularity, but I feel that this is the best book of the series. Larsson like to spend time setting up the scene which eventually becomes a very important part of the story. Very well written and something I am glad to have on my Kindle.
1451648537|5.0|I forgot how much I have loved Apple products in the past. My first Macintosh was a Bondi Blue iMac G3. It was elegant, beautiful, and Fun. All hallmarks of Apple Computer.<br /><br />This book delves not only into the life of Apple CEO Steve Jobs but also into the products the iconic company has produced over the years. Much of what Apple is and has always been is indeed Steve Jobs. His vision and philosophy drip from every product Apple designs.<br /><br />This well written and enthralling book reads like a story, is approachable, and really delves into all the people and products that made Apple, and what in turn Apple has made.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Words can't describe how much this book sucked me in. I was put off at first about what the story was about but I'm always willing to give a book a chance. All I can is WOW! Christian Grey is a man that has some serious issues but through Ana's eyes you see that underneath it all he is a good hearted man who has been seriously traumatized by his childhood. I absolutley loved all the firsts, the emails, and all the steamy sex scenes. This book is definitley a must read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good puzzle game.  Works well on Kindle Fire. Sometimes easy to make level, but harder to make in minimum moves.  Fun and certainly worth a buck.
032147404X|5.0|I started photography in 2009 with this book, among 2 others. This, by far the shortest, taught me the most about how to take good photographs as an inexperienced photographer. A genuine interest and drive for photography took me forward after that first year, but in the beginning it was this book that really set me running.<br /><br />I finished out my minor in photography a year after reading this book and it surprises me to this day how much I didn't 'learn' in those beginning classes because I had already read it in this book.<br /><br />Wholeheartedly I recommend this book to anyone with a DSLR (or point and shoot) looking to demystify their beginning photography experience.
0307719219|5.0|The authors provide a strongly descriptive, but not particularly prescriptive, discussion about what they believe are key determinants of the success or failure of societies.  The prescriptive part is difficult because it may be impossible to direct events and individuals toward making the \\"right\\" choices in their political and economic systems.  Acemoglu and Robinson make a very strong case for their theory that a stable government with what they call \\"inclusive\\" political and economic systems produces long-term prosperity and success, while \\"extractive\\" systems run by corrupt elites destroy initiative and at best limit growth and at worst result in complete failures of a nation.  Perhaps the most engaging and enjoyable aspect of this treatise is the big and little supportive stories drawn from pivotal times in the history of many nations and people - ancient to modern - which make for wonderful reading to anyone with an interest in history and its lessons.  In other words, these vignettes are worth the read quite apart from the important ideas they illustrate.  This book helps the reader understand the positive impacts of the Roman and Napoleonic empires, chronic economic problems in Latin America and Africa, the reasons the industrial revolution occurred in some countries while being resisted in others, why development in communist countries ultimately stalls out, and how seemingly small events can have huge, pivotal, surprising consequences.  This book is not just for political science and economics students.  It conveys lessons extremely pertinent to today's economic and political discussions which we would do well to heed.  It also reminds us that successful societies are the exception, not the rule, and are not guaranteed to flourish indefinitely.

B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|All the possible futures seen by Chris were various alternate realities branching off from past decisions.  When he saw those futures, he disrupted the quantum state of the multiverse and a different outcome manifested into reality due to quantum wave collapse.  As Chris said; \\"If you see the future, you change it.\\"<br /><br />As for the ending, it was more brilliant that people think.  The terrorists knew Chris Johnson was a magician so they used the same trick used by all magicians; diversion.  Chris' girlfriend was the hand seen by the audience while the other hand detonated the nuclear bomb in L.A.  That's why Chris said \\"I made a mistake.\\" just before the bomb went off.

She creates a fascinating world set about 100 years into the future of America that is scarily believable. She gets at the core of the human character and expose it for all its strengths and weaknesses. You'll want to read the whole three book series however I would only give the 3rd book four stars and it doesn't stand on its own as an independent novel.

0439023483|5.0|My kids have to read books for school and the teachers are really good at trying to find literature the students will enjoy.  Especially books that highlight thought-provoking issues.  So I try to read along with the books that I have not read yet and add to the conversation.  Two books that came out of these exercises was Ender's Game and The Hunger Games.  Both of these books have similar reads - young teenagers having to overcome adults and each other to make stupendous accomplishments.<br /><br />What I have to say in a compare and contrast type of statement is that The Hunger Games is so much better than Ender's Game.  Ender's Game was too repetitive.  It was the same concept every few years of his life - repeat, rinse...  The Hunger Games was a complete novel, well-thought out, engaging from the beginning, and much better written.  As most of the reviewers are saying, I can't wait to see the movie.  It was so well written that I could see the movie unfold as I read.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o well written<br />o grabs you early and never lets go<br />o has deeper meaning than the typical young adult book<br /><br />Cons:<br />o too short<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book.  Everyone in my family has read it and loved it.
