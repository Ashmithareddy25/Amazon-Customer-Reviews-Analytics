B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I love this book so much that I read it twice<br />I would recommend this book to people all ages
B004YM6JI2|4.0|my family and i love supernatural, its got the horror elements, some comedic elements, and awkward moments that all great horror movies have in a 40 min time slot. the story is a little less interesting this time around, and it could have been scarier. biggest complaints with this show is theyre always crying.
B0060D15AK|5.0|Best movie ever! Funny and interesting to watch. Recommend this movie to anybody who likes to have a laugh every once and a while.
B000305ZS4|2.0|ok let me get one thing straight with those who read this. I love black metal, from MayheM to Dimmu Borgir, Tsjuder, gorgoroth, enthroned, judas Iscariot..ya get the point I hope. as far as bands with similar sound as emperor (limonic art, dimmu borgir, old mans child) I have never really liked emperor. I own this pile of s*** with a couple decent tracks, and 9 equilibrium, and though equilibrium is ok (also only 3 memorable tracks) Emperor doesn't stand out at all. Seriously not at all. samoths other projects are far better. I cant, and don't get why emperor is considered one of the best black metal bands ever...maybe I don't have the right albums to get it...this album is muddy as hell, the only reason I like I am the black wizard and cosmic keys is because they are not sludge covered, but even still, NOT MEMORABLE FOR S***.if your into this style of black metal and somegow haven't heard old mans child or (old) dimmu borgir get that instead. or a more twisted version of the melodic black metal bands found in limbonic art. avoid this band at all costs. if your like me youll be very disappointed. for a better sludge covered, muddy recording check out incantations mortal throne of Nazarene, that is good sludge covered metal!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Works great with my HTC Windows Phone 8x. Pairing was super easy and took less than a minute. The call quality is very clear. With Windows Phone it evens reads aloud any text messages I receive. I've had it for two weeks and have not had to charge it yet. The clip that hooks it to the visor makes it easy to remove and put in another car if you need to. As others have mentioned, it sometimes connects to my phone when I'm outside the car - up to 10 feet away, but I'd rather have that than have it fail to connect and so far it has always connected when I'm in the car.
B009AMANBA|3.0|It's OK, but nothing to jump up and down about.<br /><br />It's not as good as the movie John Adams is.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game to me is the most addictive game I have ever played. It is on the desktop on my phone. I wish there were more than 5 lives, but then I would never get any work done. The game gets harder and harder, the challenges are intriguing. The levels seem unbeatable at times, until you happen to get lucky and pull through. I dread thinking there may be an end to this game. I would recommend to any and all who love this type of game!!! Outstanding job by the producers!!!!!!
B000SP1SH6|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I've lost count on how many times I've seen it. I think it is the best movie Bill Murry has done ever! Phil, (Bill Murray) lives Groundhogs Day so many times, I loose count with each viewing. He starts out being a pampas ass, self centered weatherman. As the movie progresses, we see the character go through many changes until in the end...he &#34;gets it&#34; and begins to care about the townsfolk, and falls in love. It leaves the viewer with the understanding that people can change! Though in this particular case life had to go to great extremes to get him there! No doubt, I will watch this movie many, many more times in the future!

B003E8P9G0|5.0|Good book I must say but I think that it was a little bit long. I love how they told the story you know Sadie and Carter. Love the book an I think everyone should read it.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Man What a differance.  And I got Lobby Cards, A copy of the script and a copy of the movie poster All in a great package.  Plenty of spicial features on the 2nd Disc I highly recomend this for all &#34;BEATLES&#34; FANS !!!!!!!!
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|A big disappointment. The last movie did not live up to what I had expected and I left the theater wondering why did JK Rowling allow crucial elements of the book completely left out and such a shallow adaptation. Why would they change the escape on the back of the dragon from Harry's idea to Hermione's? Huh? Then the added scene of Voldy and Harry flying around together, huh? Even the eloquent speech Neville Longbottom that Harry lives in all of them did not overcome the dreadful adaptation. The shocking revelation about Ariana's history which was a key to all of the books other than a part of Voldy living inside of Harry was never mentioned. The only plus to the Blu-ray are the additional special feature discs. Beginning with POA each of the movies fell flat on their faces. I stood in line with a bunch of other folks for the midnight shows and left puzzled as to the one-dimensional adaptations. Only the first two movies were movies to be reckoned with and worth the time and ticket prices. Maybe 20 years or 30 years from now the books will be shown as a TV series with a faithful transfer from book to screen instead of such botched up versions. Oh, the soundtrack is excellent though.

B009FZFONO|5.0|Loved the series because it had suspense, lots of twists and turns, ever-changing cast (unusual in a series, but very effective, and non-stop action.<br /><br />Would recommend to mature adults only.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|Interesting read and (the later books) even plausible. However, the books asked more questions than they answered, leaving the reader less than satisfied with the somewhat thrown together ending for the series. It's almost like the author thought, \\"Whoops I forgot to tell them the point! Guess I'll just throw that in with a short epilogue.\\" The last book really draws it out. \\"The Maze Runner\\" is my favorite of the trilogy.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Story and photography just wonderful.  Also sad, heartwarming, and funny.  One of the best movies ever!  Recommend it to all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book ever I could not take my eyes off of it it deserves a 10 or up and I'm a kid saying that!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great continuation of this epic series. Martin does such a great job in every aspect. This makes the series a must read.

B0073PZIYI|2.0|I liked the idea of this movie and the acting was okay, but the plot was a bit too thin for my liking. Too much of a focus on the action and not enough of explaining how the world got to be the way it was.
1609611543|5.0|The information in this book is fantastic! I have recommended it to all my family and friends. Read and follow for a healthier future
0439023513|2.0|I will be honest I was spoiled on the book before I read it and even after reading it twice I still don't like it. Katniss lost something and taking the Games out of it just made the book fall flat.
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|The copy of &#34;Argo&#34; received is defective!  It plays through the previews but the movie doesn't play at all. This must be a counterfeit and I'm sorry I wasted my time and money buying it.  (I also bought &#34;Lincoln&#34; which seems to be ok. This was my first time using Amazon...and my last.
B0038OY6DW|4.0|Die hard Holmes fans don't give this movie enough credit. There is more callbacks to the original stories in this adaption then in any before it. That said this movie does have a plot hole or two but it's still a love letter to fans that is full of subtext and popcorn fun. Watch and judge for yourself.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Lots of aha moments with this great book!<br />Found myself highlighting alot of passages!<br />Great mix of personal stories and tips.

B004T32SOK|3.0|The Kindle Fire isn't a great device for content.  It's for reading - reading books, magazines, email, and the web.  So, while I can get to my Box account and folders, there isn't much that I can do with the docs inside.  Not the fault of the app, just a limitation of the Fire.
B00007AJGH|5.0|I am still amazed every time I watch this movie. The effects are fantastic and the acting amazing. Top that off with a fun plot and this movie is still a must buy.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Some apps are great because they do great things, and others are great because they do exactly what you want them to do.  Twitter falls in the latter category.  It works very will with my Kindle Fire.
B001EBWITA|3.0|I didn't know much about Constantine when I saw the movie version but I thought it was fun and I still do. If you want a densely plotted mystery head to the graphic novel, if you want a bit of fun and a lot of horror then watch this with an open mind.
B004PZ4HC8|4.0|The novel begins as the narrator explains that he was hired by the United States government to give a complete history of the Zombie War. He circled the globe collecting facts, figures, and firsthand accounts of how citizens of different countries managed the zombies from the first outbreaks through the retreat to safe zones and until the zombies were defeated. The government deleted any emotion or firsthand accounts, as they claimed they only wanted statistics to digest and analyze. The narrator takes everything not used in the government's report and compiles them in this book.<br /><br />From the introduction on, I was immediately gripped by this story and the way Max Brooks wrote it. His ability to become so many different characters from around the world and get their stories from different time periods of the war is a testament to his writing style. Though there were flaws in the book, I read it in less than a week, desperately seeking to find out how the war turned in favor of humans. That, to me, is the point of storytelling, and that is why this book is such a success.<br /><br />The range of characters made the story real. First was a Chinese doctor who came across the \\"Patient Zero\\" in a small village in rural China. There was a mercenary hired by a wealthy stockbroker to guard his mansion in Long Island that housed movie stars, athletes, and pop singers. There were two accounts from American soldiers, one early who fought at Yonkers, a turning point for the worse in the war. The second account was near the end as America goes on the offensive. A blind Japanese man fled his job as a gardener to a forest to avoid any more shame. There, him and a teenager whose family was killed as he read updates online, defended the island after its evacuation.<br /><br />Though I was impressed with Brooks' ability to become so many different characters, rarely using them for more than one section, I didn't always get the individuality of each character. Many of them, though from all over the planet, told their stories in similar styles and tones. Many of them were educated, but still none needed a translator. Some had tics, or phrases, they repeated throughout their accounts, but most didn't have their nationalities or regions come across in their speech, something I thought would've added diversity and scope to the novel.<br /><br />The interview concept had its appeal, but the novel did lack consistent characters to follow and worry about. It seemed more like a documentary, bits and pieces from many sources, than a novel with characters the reader becomes emotionally involved with. This way of storytelling left the arc of the Zombie War as the only consistent thread throughout the novel and the introduction hints at the ending. A great novel has many different subplots and major and minor characters readers see change throughout. This way of writing will definitely leave some longing for more connection to recurring characters, or even between interviews, but I think in the overall scheme of things, Brooks pulled it off.<br /><br />Though the writing won't go down as legendary, and though the characters could've shown more identity in their speech, this book will stick around for a long time because of the way Brooks prepared and told it. Vast in scope, easy to read, and hard to put down are ingredients for great storytelling and Brooks nailed them all.
B000UDJS2S|3.0|Ghost Rider is not one of Marvel's more well known properties, so I was excited when the movie came out. Peter Fonda is fantastic as always but the rest of the actors fall very short. The story too fails, the villain doesn't really work and the ending is meh. Buy if you want to, but I would say rent and give it back after 24 hours.
B009PDO946|4.0|This is a festive concert to enjoy. The repertoire is as expected except for the addition of Wagner and Verdi, to initiate the 200 anniversaries. Most of the music is by the Strauss family as traditional in these concerts. It is a pleasure to listen to, and the images make you feel like you are there (almost). At the end, some humor is introduced to add to the festive occasion.  I was happily surprised by the extras: Honeymoon is a beautiful short movie with great music and impressive video shots, a real treat.  The ballet sequence is interesting and very well filmed.  This Blu-ray disc is certainly worth the price.
B000IMM3XW|4.0|Love it or hate it this kicked off the Marvel domination of film and it is well deserved. The acting isn't perfect but the action and plot make up for it. A must buy for any Marvel fan.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|I've purchased a similar driver kit from Radio Shack which had fewer bits and overall was a much lower build quality for nearly the same price.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|I went to see Silver Linings Playbook with a friend of mine after it had been showing in theaters for a while just out of curiosity. I only knew the film by name, and had decided to not even watch the trailer so that it would be a total surprise, and man oh man...what a surprise it was! I adored it. The cast was marvelous and the story fantastic. After leaving the movie theater, my friend and I went to go have dinner and the entire time we just couldn't stop talking about it! This film just totally made our night on the town the best it could be because of how inspirational and uplifting it is. So glad April 30th is here, so I can finally own it.
B00BLGZDVS|4.0|Great show, Hoffman and Phoenix deliver...but man is it weird. Phoenix's character especially will gross you out. Storyline is a little choppy and not much resolution but great show.
B007M45XL8|1.0|who is this supposed to appeal to? it's a sonic mess. whoever mixed it needs to put the reefer down and get their feet on the ground. just a mushy semi funky mess that has nothing whatsoever to do with dr. john or mac rebenack. what idiot sketched this out on the back of a napkin and sold it to rebenack? take that guy down to the town square and spank him in public
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We were recommended to  watch Downton Abbey.  When we received our CD for season 1  & 2 we found that we could not stop watching which  meanst a number of nights that went into the early morning hour.  We just had  to get through the first two<br />seasons so that we could watch  season 3 which we were recording.  I great show and now we are excited to know that season 4 will be starting shortly... Can't Wait.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Stills voice caught my attention with Buffalo Springfield and went further trough Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  His words often carried me through rought spots.  This was a fantastic collection - songs I loved and even songs I didn't really know.  The remasters were great.  If you've been a long time Stills fan, this set is fabulous.
B00AYR2FOI|2.0|I was  quite disappointed with the CD.  The  sound quality was poor and the songs did not sound like the previews that I had listened to.  I was hoping for much better quality.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|HIM is back from a 3 year sabbatical with \\"Tears On Tape\\", a highly anticipated album. This time, they recorded the album on their own dime without any record label association. HIM has had the backing of a major label since their inception, would this prove to be a fatal flaw?<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Unleash The Red\\", an instrumental track. We open with the sounds of a tape being inserted into a tape deck followed by what can best be described as the sort of thing you'd hear in a Dario Argento film. Melodic, dark and brooding, this minute long track leads us directly into the first song proper, \\"All Lips Go Blue\\".<br /><br />\\"All Lips Go Blue\\" is the first single in both the U.S. and U.K. and is a fitting track. The opening guitars have a satisfying crunch that continues throughout the heavy parts of the song. Verses and choruses will remind longtime HIM fans of \\"Right Here In My Arms\\". This is how that song would sound if Ville first recorded it in 2013 opposed to 1999. This song is a great example of the yin/yang of HIM that Ville Valo always preaches. You get a nice blend of the pop side of doom, along with the gothic, dark side. I'm not sure that this was the best track for the U.S., but I will cover that in a bit.<br /><br />Up next is \\"Love Without Tears\\". As soon as I saw all of the song titles, I figured this was one I would be fond of, and thankfully now that I've heard it, it's one of my favorites on the album.  The track starts with an unrelenting guitar and breaks into one of the most layered HIM sounds I've ever heard. The subtle harmonizing vocals just make it for me. The music sounds like a more matured \\"Pretending\\", with drums, bass, guitar, acoustic guitar and tambourine all coming together like peanut butter and chocolate with Ville's sweet vocals. At about 2:15 we go into a very brief acoustic portion and then to a unique guitar solo that reminds me of a folk-rock band from the 70's. It's very well done.<br /><br />The 4th track is \\"I Will Be The End Of You\\", which was first played live at Helldone 2012 in Finland. I will admit, I wasn't a huge fan of the live version, nor was I impressed with the initial 30 second preview I heard a while back. However, as I should know by now, do not judge a book by its cover. IWBTEOY is amazing lyrically. The basis of the song is that \\"love\\" is telling Ville that it will be his ending, and Ville is just like, \\"bring it on.\\" Despite the slightly higher pitched vocals, this is a dirty, punky song. The music itself sounds like something that could have been on 1999's \\"Razorblade Romance\\" and compliments the vocals wonderfully. One nitpick is that his vocals during the verses could be turned up slightly, but that's a minor quibble.<br /><br />\\"I Will Be The End Of You\\" transitions right into the title track, \\"Tears On Tape\\". TOT may well be my favorite track off the album. Gorgeous piano and acoustic guitar punctuate the track, alongside some of the finest bass playing on the album. The only thing missing is a guitar solo, but it doesn't detract from the song at all. In addition to being the title track in name, \\"Tears On Tape\\" lyrically explains the theme of the entire album. It's the bands' tribute to all of the blood, sweat and tears put onto \\"tape\\" by the music that inspires them.  Ville always goes on about how the band is influenced by anything from Roy Orbison to Black Sabbath and Metallica and on this album it's finally, plainly, evident.<br /><br />\\"Into The Night\\" is the first Finnish single, and to be honest, I wasn't a big fan at first. This is the poppiest track on the album, very similar in sound to something you'd hear off \\"Dark Light\\". This track again is one that very obviously shows off the band's influences whilst still displaying the usual bit of \\"Scandinavian melancholy\\" they are known for. \\"Into The Night\\" does feature my favorite portion of the album, from about 2:15 till about 2:45, which is some of the best music the band has ever done. \\"IntoThe Night\\" was a track I played to someone who had never heard HIM before...this was her introduction to the band and she was caught off guard. She expected something darker, harder and perhaps with screaming. She liked the track, and now listens to the band on her own. I initially dismissed this as the single, but have come to realize that the intent is to gain new listeners, not necessarily make the old timers happy, and \\"Into The Night\\" manages to do both.<br /><br />The pop side of HIM gives way to some rough guitars in \\"Hearts At War\\".  This is a song that would fit right in on \\"Venus Doom\\", with doomy atmosphere, pianos and gloomy lyrics. What I like most about this song is how much it surprised me. It's little things, but the song ventures into different places that aren't out of place for HIM, but seem out of place for this song. It's fantastic, and it's one of my favorites on the album.  After the song is \\"Trapped In Autumn\\" a minute and half long instrumental, which is really just an atmospheric outro to \\"Hearts At War\\". Taken as such, it's fine, but don't expect a full fledged HIM track.<br /><br />\\"No Love\\" begins with Ville walking into the studio and yelling \\"Forever and ever!\\" before some rockin' guitars kick in. It's out of place on first listening, but once you get to the end of the song you'll understand. \\"No Love\\" reminds me of \\"Soul On Fire\\" musically. It's a fast rocker with Ville's crooning vocals slathered on top. At 2 minutes in we go to a breakdown that features some electronic noises, tambourines and a very 90's sounding segment. Of course, being HIM, things come back full steam as a drum beat takes us back into the chorus. I didn't expect to like this one based on the 30 second preview I heard, but it's very, very good. A solid track from HIM.<br /><br />\\"Drawn & Quartered\\" however, is a different story.  This is the typical ballad. It's very lovely sounding, but I just can't get into it. I think this is mainly because this is a prog-inspired track that never really feels like it's going anywhere. It's more of an exercise for Ville to see how long of a song he can write that doesn't repeat back on itself. It reminds me of \\"Sleepwalking Past Hope\\" lite, just not as good. I like the last minute and a half of the track, but I'm relatively bored until that point.<br /><br />From here we descend into hell. \\"Lucifer's Chorale\\" is another transitional instrumental that drops us straight from the heavenly sounds of \\"Drawn & Quartered\\" into the depths of hell, preparing us for \\"W.L.S.T.D.\\".  It's mostly noise, but like \\"Trapped In Autumn\\", works well as a transition.<br /><br />\\"W.L.S.T.D.\\" is another heavy track, and would fit right at home on either \\"Venus Doom\\" or \\"Love Metal\\".  It's a very polished \\"Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666\\" track, and that's not a bad thing. Heavy, slow, and deep vocals are the name of the game here.  I really enjoy the lyrics on this one, possibly moreso than anything else on the album. The simple verse of \\"When love starts to die, it begins with a kiss, violently soothing and warm. When love starts to die, so do I. \\" gets me everytime. This song makes me want to rock out and cry at the same time. It's the perfect example of HIM's ying/yang approach.  \\"W.L.S.T.D.\\" would be the perfect album closer, but, there's one more to go.<br /><br />\\"Kiss The Void\\" is an instrumental outro to the entire album and it is amazing. This is a song that I would listen to on its own, unlike some of the other instrumentals on this album. I wish that Ville would have taken the melody from this and evolved it into a full track with vocals...maybe one day. \\"Kiss The Void\\" manages to sum up the whole album's feeling into one track and, like most HIM albums, ends the album appropriately.<br /><br />So what do I think of \\"Tears On Tape\\"? It's wonderful! HIM's time away was a good thing for the music and being able to record the album first and then shop it around to labels was also a very good thing. This isreally the first time that HIM has put out an album that truly sounds like what Ville Valo always says HIM albums sound like. Regardless of what my own thoughts on the album are, I will always hold it in high regard for that fact alone...Ville Valo finally made the album he wanted to make....and it's awesome. I would rank this highly among the other HIM albums and highly recommend it to the HIM faithful and newcomers alike.

1476734941|5.0|5 stars because it really worked. I won't call it a diet because it's more of a lifestyle. I did this several years ago, before the book,  and the weight melted away. Lost so much weight that people I had known for years but whom I hadn't seen in months literally did not recognize me. Here is how it went for me: I fasted about 3 days a week, eating healthy and very lightly on the fast days, usually at the end of the day or the very beginning. The first week was very hard but each succeeding week became easier until I noticed one day that something had changed.  I don't know how to explain this but the feeling of hunger was no longer as intense, frequent or alarming. Nor was it triggered by sight of food, time of day or environment. Mindless snacking stopped. A dietitian recently told me that regular overeating rewires the brain so that it can no longer tell the difference between real hunger and other sensations; fasting is like hitting a reset button and restoring the normal default setting. I became like the people who had always puzzled me before; I no longer thought about food all the time and I ate less on non-fast days. Best of all, when I did eat I really enjoyed every bite. These changes occurred naturally. When I reached my goal weight I backed off on the frequency of fasting, stabilized and sustained it for a very long time.<br /><br />Now having said all that, it's not magic. While it doesn't take a lot of effort to maintain it, it does take vigilance, especially as your metabolism slows with age. Here I am years later overweight again because I was not vigilant. I am fasting 3 days a week again and again the weight is coming off. It's not as hard this time because I know the discomfort is temporary. By the way, I did go to the doctor first to make sure I have no blood sugar, heart or other issues. Buy the book; it's helpful to re-read as needed to get inspiration to keep going.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As the first, I WILL recommend this book to all those HOPELESS ROMANTICS. Book two of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy is even BETTER than the first. SHOCKING REVELATIONS are made, keeping you guessing of what will happen next. As I said with the first book of this trilogy, it is at the TOP of my FAVORITE BOOKS list!!...
B005DF2QMC|2.0|I have windows vista and it didn't work the way I thought it would. The setup is easy, but it just didn't deliver.
B0039P1O4O|5.0|We have had 3 BlueAnts and 4-5 Motorolas.  Audio on the BlueAnts/Motorolas was scratchy and noisy for the receiver, would lose the pairing, and slow to connect.  At a third of the cost of the BlueAnt, the Supertooth has never lost it's pairing, connects each and every time we get in the car, and the audio for the receiver is natural and almost noise-free.  What a welcome change!
052118939X|5.0|Very good edition. It is very usefull for me as a textbook and allow for me emprove my english. And it is very comfortable to have a book with exellent quality printing.
B0041KW3H8|5.0|Got this for my girlfriend since we are learning Italian. The bluray is great because it has the Italian but also has like 4 or 5 other languages (including English) so you can still enjoy the movie in all the different ways. Besides all that it's a great movie.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Although not all of the characters, the story was still great and  I am so excited to get started on the next book!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every book and character in this series. I hope to see these all made into blockbuster movies someday.
0316067598|5.0|This book was so ingrossing that it was hard to put down. I reread it again in about two weeks.
B00A83075M|4.0|Saw this in the movies and loved it.  This was purchased for my grandson for his Easter basket and he loved it too.
0062082353|5.0|This was a very good informative read. I couldn't put it down. It's to bad chris kyle survived war and came home to be shot.
0783226888|4.0|Well made drama that proceeds at a pace that allows you to develop like or dislike for charactors.  Sidney Poiter did job well not overpowering scenes that involved interaction with co-stars.  Bruce Willis as a cold, methodical killer was great and Richard Gere did a good of holding his Irish accent.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|my son loves it, really I mean I love it.  download it & waste some time w/a smile on your face
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This product is wonderful.  The move is great quality as well as a definite classic.  Also the extras you get are great.  The box it all comes in is beautiful.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I enjoyed this even though I really like the Original Star Trek.  This reboot of the Star Trek takes some liberties and it would have been nice to feature the original Captain Kirk in some kind of cameo role...like Spock
1843560267|5.0|The larger font in this publication helps a lot.Much easier to use than the Oxford version.Could be even  larger, but a help nonetheless.
1451668945|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has been writing blockbusters for a very long time and her newest book hits the mark again.
B00005QW4K|5.0|It was a very funny one that i have see.<br />I love first one and now i love this one too.<br />Also this Director's cut of the army of darkness is very cool.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The is one of the best books I've read. Thoroughly engrossing to the point of actually seeing, feeling, smelling, hell, being in the story! ENOUGH!! On to book 2...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is ok but the first book was way better. The ending is ok. I guess for me I wanted more...
1400069807|5.0|The service was expedient<br />The book is solid.<br />i'm sure the book will add to my knowledge<br />obtainned over living 93 years.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever heard. This is NKOTB at their best. Lyrics are very beautiful.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I agree word for word with the first review for this album (this being the 2nd)... I will add only this: \\"OUTFREAKINGSTANDING!\\"
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I received the DVD's when promised & everything with the order went as it was stated.  I have watched all the shows on this season & loved everyone of them.  If you are a science fiction fan, this is for you!
B005LAII62|5.0|This movie has received a lot of ridiculous criticism from people that are most like lousy or lazy parents. It's sad that a movie teaching acceptance is avoided because parents are too scared to let their kids learn. God forbid you teach your kids that some people are different and don't deserve to be bullied or made fun of. I've read reviews on this site and others condemning this movie over it's \\"homosexual content\\", there's one sentence of dialogue where a man references having a boyfriend. If you can't handle that or are terrified of your kids hearing that then shame on you.<br /><br />Norman is a kid who sees ghosts and is deeply interested and involved with all things paranormal and it's because of this that he has no friends and suffers bullying and isolation his whole life even his dad struggles with accepting that his son his so weird. This movie has a lot of heavy and sad moments but it's not only appropriate but important.<br /><br />Wonderful moral and message aside this movie has amazing animation, a fun original story and a really good soundtrack. From the previews I didn't expect to love this movie, I thought it'd be okay at best but it completely blew my mind.<br /><br />I can't wait to watch it again around Halloween time.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I have watched all of these & enjoyed them very much.  I would watch them over & over again.  Came to me as stated & is very good quality.
030758836X|3.0|This book is so good...stay awake all night, hide from your kids so you can read during the day good. Until the end. The end leaves you feeling like a fool as you scramble for more...there must be another page...there must be MORE. But there isn't more. It's one of those stories that after hundreds of pages of waiting to find out what happens it just ends. It's more than not having closure or not having justice. There's just not an ending! It's like being cut off mid-sentence during a phone conversation. But you can't call back! Grrrrrr!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|I found Dredd to be a very good movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys action movies. It's a bit futuristic, but I enjoyed it. Thanks<br /><br />John
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Enjoy all the different game levels, Never bored by the challenges I get. Try it, if you like a good mind game, you will like this.
0307591549|5.0|This book has been extremely influential to me as both a writer and when I travel and speak to coaches and parents of young athletes. All too often, we think that happiness comes last, after hard work and success, but Achor shows us that we have it all backwards. When we focus on being happy first, then we are far more likely to take ownership, work hard, and eventually achieve excellence and success. It provides concrete examples of how to take small steps to incorporate the principles into your daily life, and through these small changes make big ones. When reading this book, I constantly found myself laughing, nodding, and interrupting my wife to read her another great passage. Five stars!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very simple concept; give OmNom candy........ but there's wayyyyy more to it l!!! With a lot of obstacles, this game will never bore you!!!!!! :)
1908117230|4.0|Great book with a lots of amazing pictures.<br />Good idea if you're looking for macrons flavors, but not so much about the technique of making them, which is the most difficult.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how the person gets faster and you get different people and alot of coins and they make your hands move fast
1609611543|5.0|This book literally changed my life. I have never read a book on nutrition or diet that had such a profound effect on my overall health and well being. Putting into practice the author's prescription for a healthy diet has resulted in my losing almost 15 pounds in 8 weeks and most significantly eliminating my cravings for both wheat and sugar. I truly see an end to my lifelong battle with being overweight, and an opportunity to be more satisfied with my appearance, more energetic, and healthier. I have purchased multiple copies for friends and family. The book turned me into a &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; true believer.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and challenging. Makes you think and is fun also. I would recommend to all.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The cinema photography and music in this production is outstanding.  I'd have to say I liked it even better than Phantom of the Opera.  Hugh Jackmans performance is one of the best I'd ever seen.  Even if a musical isn't your thing you will change your mind after seeing this.  Absolutely a must see!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Great game to play and easy to learn. The cards are made with weaker cardstock, so I recommend you buy card sleeves because there is a lot of shuffling involed with this game.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Informative & fast read. Book is filled w/great ways to communicate w/others. I especially liked the continuous reference to liking oneself which in turn will allow most others to like you as well. This is a great read for the individual(s) that cannot or who refuses to do small talk and doesn't understand how to ask questions.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very enticing and hard to put down. Very Sexy... I was able to connect with the main character. I think this book was very well thought out and written. I am now purchasing &#34;Fifty Shades Darker&#34;, the next book in E L James' trilogy.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I bought it for one song Don't Rush which I can play over and over 1000 times. Love this one.
B0042RJWTC|2.0|There's not much to like in this show.  Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More is excellent, but that's about it.  Every other character is badly cast and almost all characterizations really exaggerated.  Katharine of Aragon is well played, even if the actress doesn't fit the physical description.  Most of the actors and actresses don't look anything like they should, and there's no attempt to even try, with hair color, colored contacts, etc. which would have been simple enough.<br /><br />The casting of JRM as Henry VIII is ludicrous; they could hardly have found an actor less like Henry VIII if they worked at it deliberately.  Henry VIII was about 6 feet tall, muscular, and had reddish hair; JRM is short, dark, and has incredibly narrow shoulders.<br /><br />I can tolerate some historical inaccuracy, but this show is so, so rife with them, and for no purpose that I can tell in most cases.  The way they jacked up the story of Henry's sister being married off to a foreign king was senseless; the real story was way better than what they threw together, using the wrong sister, the wrong king, etc.  That part was so, so bad, I could hardly sit through it.<br /><br />The ridiculous sex scenes and use of the \\"F\\" word really push it to the edge of being unwatchable; some episodes are worse than others with the offensive content.  This is a show to watch if you have nothing better to do, which is why I'm watching it now.  LOL
B004I744AS|4.0|This is a great way to view words while reading or just browsing for a unknown word that may have been said.
1937909514|5.0|I am sad to see this series come to an end.  Adrien is truly one of the greatest characters to grace a series.  I just love Josh Lanyon's style.  I don't think there is another author that does the introspective MC like he does.  I love Lanyon's other full length novel series, Holmes & Moriarity, and hope that we get at least 5 books out of that series as well.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I &#60;3 mark of athena! I can't wait for house of Hades! it is amazing and i like it even better then harry potter (no offense or anything) and can't wait for the sea of monsters! (the movie)
B009GX7IRA|4.0|Very good price and love that I can access it from any computer. Do wish there was instant video support for tablets though.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I find this alarm clock perfect for the job. It gets me up! I like that I can set it for specific days. And the sleep timer with waterfall sounds is great! Most of all, it doesn't tic.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A wonderful ending to an epic fantasy series. Brandon Sanderson did a terrific job of finishing the story out nearly seamlessly.
B001O1O71C|5.0|a different point of view that u will never guess the ending . left me bewildered and shocked.. i found it hard to move from the spot where i was when i finished reading!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you like to play bingo this a bingo game to play. great game!!!!!!!!! i love it!!!!!!!!!!!<br />i enjoy playing at any time.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game. It is so fun and I play in every day. I highly recommend it to all MLP lovers
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Seriously, think of all the really bad movies that are based off of video games, there's a ton. This movie not only blows them out of the water but actually manages to make a great original story at the same time.<br /><br />As a gamer who remembers just about every game mentioned (saw my childhood flash before me in the opening arcade montage) this movie manages to capture that fun of what a video game is all about. Not to mention makes you wonder just how you'd like doing the same job over and over again for 30 years.<br /><br />It's got the laugh for the kids and nostalgia for us mid-30 types who remember all this stuff.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I'm tired of the games always wanting you to pay to get ahead. Other then that, the game is okay.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|Enjoy it! It's great, now if I could get the hubby talked into a surround sound in the living room it'd feel like we were there. These guys are great.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I like it is way better than seasons and original but if you want a really cool angry birds get space ( it cost money )
B009B0L324|5.0|Present for my hubby and he loves it. We got wasted and listened to the whole thing. Both disks, jumping around and singing. Good times.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Marvelous story of two people who feel incapable of love after waking up married following a single night of partying in Las Vegas.  Sharply drawn characters and plausible motivations lift the story above a somewhat tired romantic premise and make this an enjoyable read.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|I may be biased, but this movie is a lot of fun. It's great return to the screen for Arnold and a terrific way for American audiences to be introduced to director Kim Ji Woon.
B005LAII12|2.0|If you like juvenile jokes with lots of profanity and racism, this will be right up your alley. There were a few funny moments, but overall I felt like I suffered through it. A 35 year old man with a teddy bear for a best friend just isn't that funny. It's pathetic. The teddy bear is foul mouthed, a drug user, a drunk, and a womanizer (although it doesn't explain how that can be). It's weird.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Collin Firth is so hot in a quite way.  To date this is the best version of this story that has been made.  And with Collin in it how can you go wrong.  The extras are nice but I guess I wish there were a few more, but that is probably just me I am an extras geek.
B000FC1192|5.0|I bought this book before a non-stop flight from Phoenix to Boston. I finished it in about an hour. I always enjoy authors who can really tap into a child's mind. Some of his stuff I think is a little too spooky for kids, Great but this one is perfect. Great book.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It is so clear on my HD TV. I think I enjoyed it more at home and seeing it again than the first time when I saw it in the theater.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was a bit worried about the stability of this bag, but it handles great on the trails.  Zippers are smooth and material is strong.<br /><br />I've already taken it on 3 day hikes and have had no problems.  Easily holds my 5dii with 70-200 2.8 along with 2 other lenses, sandwiches, and flash.  I strap my tripod to it and I'm good to go.  I can even fit a bottle of water on the outside strap.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend, especially for only $12!!!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This novel is a great read. The characters were original and the author writes beautifully. With such a strong beginning and middle, the end falls somewhat flat, but does not disappoint because it is such an magical story of love and fate. I loved every minute of this book.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Original style, music that makes you feel good and is also intelligent, a rare find.<br />I love it and your sister does too.
0385349947|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone, men and women.<br />It gave me more confidence in myself and to not be afraid to try different things.  Just get right in and lead our chapter of American Business Women in Kalamazoo, Michigan<br />Thank you so much!<br />Joann
B005KCGIUY|5.0|If you get the chance to see Puscifer in concert, do it.  They put on an awesome show, just don't take a picture or Maynard will have you thrown out.<br />BTW, skip Emotive, it's a bunch of hippie commie nonsense.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is really funny!! I love how it is written. Most of it is scientifically sound, which is not the case for most sci-if novels. If you like mars and science you will like this book!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|DVD did not work although it was brand new and unopened.  I understand that this is a flaw with the manufacturers.  A friend of ours had to buy three to get one that works.  Very disappointing waste of money.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved everything about this book.  What a moving story about the relationship of dog and his man.  Could not put it down.
0756697875|5.0|My grandson love's this book, we got him to take out a front baby tooth that was fallen out and then gave him the book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Heartfelt story that takes you on the writers journey.  Well written.  Touching and beautiful characters.<br />Very emotional.  Buy this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I couldn't put down this game!  This is the game that will get you to bed late, make you late for work and you think about all day.  I just wish for more.  Addictive!  Waiting with anticipation for the next Room!  Contrary to an earlier review, Room is not boring like Mist.  Much more intriguing!  LOVED IT!!!!
B008966SLM|5.0|This CD returns some major swank back to Robert's musical catalogue. I loved his recent stuff but this album harkens back to the soul of the Strong Persuader album!
068485743X|4.0|I chose this rating because the book contians not only tips on how an editor approaches a piece of prose but writing tips for authors as well.  I think this book will serve aspiring authors as a good reference and as a refresher for ones already having experience in  dealing with editors.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|Truly enjoyed this deluxe CD set! Also loved the downloadable version of the live CD set (that included Hello Old Friend and Sign Language).
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is just another example of a true Patriot.  Chris (RIP) was an example of how we should all live.  Love America!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read most of Nicholas Sparks' books and am a huge fan.  Safe Haven was another great book and I could not put this one down!  Loved, loved, loved it!
0688091717|5.0|The book is so perfect for preschool aged children.  I use it in my classroom during letter &#34;E&#34; week.  They really enjoyed this book!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Great book!<br />Couldn't put it down and you never could predict the twist and turns.  My first book of his but won't be the last
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I didn't really know what this story was about but I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I really liked it and wasn't disappointed at all. It is a really interesting glimpse into the world of mental illness. The reader sees how delusional the main character is while still being able empathize with him. I really felt like I understood his desperation. Can't wait to watch the movie now!!
0743201140|4.0|This book is a good insight to your own strengths and how to use the strengths to your advantage. Its a bit of a confidence boost knowing that you are naturally good at something and that through time and effort you can turn that natural talent into a strength that you can use everyday.
0374533555|5.0|It is always a pleasure to get inside one's head,  especially so when the guide is erudite and eloquent. We think  erroneously that we think clearly most of the time. Here is good corrective medicine.
B0001I55OC|2.0|This is a terrible adaptation of the book. Very disappointing. Maybe it would be ok if you haven't read the book. But, don't bother. The book is so much better.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I first read, Gone Girl: A novel by Gillian Flynn. I am an avid reader, I grab a book and become it. After reading Gone Girl, I new that I would love and enjoy any book she wrote. You almost forget you're reading a book, it's like you're in the book itself. Five stars isn't enough for this book. Immediately after reading it, before writing my review, I downloaded Dark Places. So, my review is over. Time to start another.
0316077046|4.0|The story was a bit slow until about halfway through. I'm enjoying the characters and the plot. The big, dramatic finish that you are expecting is a bit of a let down. However, this is the middle story, which usually means it is just setting you up for something better in the next story. I hope that's the case. I've started book 3 already.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|It was a fun read. I wouldn't spend a lot of money on it. But if you love books and love science, you will like this book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great movie!! This is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over again, and just listen to the music in the background while I do other things. Would definitely recommend if you are a musical fan. The cast is great! Anne Hathaway is phenomenal, but also be on the lookout for great performances from less-known names such as Samantha Barks (Eponine), Eddie Redmayne (Marius), and Aaron Tveit (Enjolras).
B000UJBYD8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised to get Born Into This and listen to how good it was. The Cult have delivered a solid, if not outstanding album here with the single Dirty Little Rockstar, Tiger in the Sun and Illuminated all being highlights. The albums doesn't really have any bad songs on it and the production is solid, if not as powerful as Bob Rock's on Beyond Good and Evil.<br /><br />Now, go buy Sonic Temple and Love too.
B0067R0APK|4.0|My go to weather app.  Excellent product. The paid version is worth it. Because of the maps and ease of use.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|it works it covers it opens and it closes it holds the kindle snug and looks pretty and it is hard
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Very fine reading would recommend it highly and looking forward to reading the next volumne - You will truly feel a part of the action
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome! This book kept me on the edge of my seat! Can't wait to read the next two books in the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am 70+ and I did not like facebook because there was to much information out there with Groupme you only talk to who is in your group.
B0091TGWYE|1.0|it is too tight to fit the iPhone 5. Once I put the phone in, it was impossible to get out, even with using the tab that supposedly &#34;pops out&#34; the iPhone; it does no such thing. I had to cut the stitching on the case down halfway on each side to get the phone out. So<br />This is a definite &#34;don't buy&#34; since when you put your iPhone 5 into the case, you can't get it out without breaking the very product you bought
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Simple, straightforward and clear, exactly what I was looking for to be able to handle the formatting issues myself! Thanks a lot! Mario Cavolo, Author, Catalysts To Change
0671004107|5.0|This is an excellent book to interest young people in science. I think that the lead character in it, Arroway, is designed to make young women feel that doing science does not mean forsaking being feminine: Arroway is described as liking elegant shapely clothing and at one point in the book is described putting on nail polish. There were a few points in the book where I felt like Sagan was trying to make the reader feel clever; for example when Arroway is in the courtyard of the Louvre she sees a statue with only the letters LTA remaining under it, and I suspect the reader is supposed to be delighted to know that is probably VOLTAIRE. But I don't think this is a bad thing, at least for a book to be read by young people for inspiration. I think people should be delighted when they do something clever.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|It had some interesting parts...but I wanted to learn more about how the characters from the first three books got to the box...none of this is explained...big disappointment.
B00B1EEKM8|4.0|This is a great DVD; I've seen it before so I knew I'd like it. It's all about aDisneyland-like park with dinosaurs. I liked that it was blu-ray with DVD and digital copy.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|Abortion.  It's the only thing I can say.  My ass still itches.  Abortion, abortion, abortion, horrible, bloody abortion....I want my money back so that I can help TC pay for his dignity.
6304698798|4.0|I gave this movie four stars because it is a classic. We bought it for a old-time movie night. I needed it i DVD, so it was perfect.
B007R0WHMK|5.0|I watched this one trying to understand how it was different from all stories of psycos. Well the end makes it totally different from any movie I have ever seen. So when I watched it the second time I saw the humor in it, the first time I was just too pensive about the plot to fully enjoy it.
1433502410|5.0|One of the best things I have done for my understanding the word of God.  I am a poor reader and speller and even I can use it well.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Amazing songs.<br />Wonderful cover for first album.<br />LOVE IT!<br />Unfortunatly, MCR doesn't exist now, but their songs will live forever!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I missed this series when it began.  I'm so glad to be getting caught up now!  It was worth the wait.
B006ID6NDQ|2.0|Was a real disappointment!  Not something that I would recommend to anyone.  Although a friend recommended it to  me..I've read much better novels on the subject for this time period.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book one of the best I have ever read, I would highly recommend it to any reader interested in history.
1419702238|5.0|The book is well written on a child's level of thinking.  The collection is very enjoyed by her.  Will be finding the next book for her.
6305433909|5.0|Watching Sister Act requires that Sister Act 2 be purchased also.  For some reason Whoopi Goldberg has made a number of movies that fall into my frequently watched, most loved collection.  I love the end of this movie where the kids put on an exciting musical presentation which really makes me want to get moving!
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|This is such an interesting and beautiful take on a classic!  The end wraps up pretty quickly, but all in all the costumes and theater-like production makes it very interesting to watch.  No movie can really replace a book, but I enjoyed this for the scenery and beauty.
6302581907|5.0|As with a few other movies I was disappointed to find this only on VHS so I was unable to view it again.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book has helped me with my home work.I want another one but in Japanese!<br />Has anyone read warriors by Erin Hunter?<br />Seekers?<br />Or wolves of the Beyond?<br />Tell me  I would love to see your comments!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|My husband loves this new cd Depeche Mode made to add to his collection. Always enjoy listening to Depeche Mode music
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Picked it up as the FAOTD, and I've been playing for a while now. It reminds me a bit of a souped-up version of the 2D biplane game from the Intellivision &#34;Triple Action&#34; cartridge, but with powerups and much more lethal AI enemies. It's a keeper.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs was someone that I greatly admired.  He was visionary, very creative and seriously flawed.  Isaacson does a good job covering Steve Jobs personal life.  Since Jobs authorized access, it gives a different perspective on the man outside of the business spotlight.  It was especially emotional to cover the various stages of the health issues that led to Jobs death.<br /><br />This book is a must read for Apple fans and especially Steve Jobs fans.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I was introduced to this product by my daughter. It has been great to help me track my progress and to distract me when I don't want to be running. So far it has held up well and locking the bezel is a must because it is so sensitive that it keeps shifting around to different programs.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I continue to like the wise cracking John Corey.  This story centers around the American born Panther a terrorist that is operating out of Yemen and is one of the organizers of the USS Cole attack.  Corey and his wife, Kate Mayfield, are assigned to find the Panther.  So it is off to Yemen.  Most of the book takes place in Yemen.<br /><br />DeMille does a very good job of presenting the 'feel' of Yemen.  He accurately describes how dysfunctional and dangerous life for a Westerner can be.  I enjoyed the richness of this description and how the culture interacts with someone like Corey.  The only negative that I have with the book is that it is more centered on the location of the story than it is about a mystery/thriller.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see where DeMille takes Corey and Mayfield from here.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|This movie provides decent entertainment for Hitchcock fans, but lacks some of the depth of detail one would expect in a film like this. There are no real revelations or even insight into what made Mr. Hitchcock tick. Since he is larger than life, I was hoping for more. Having said that, it is reasonably entertaining and true fans will most likely enjoy the show.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|DeMille has always had a way of weaving a story.  In Plum island, there is murder, mystery, germ apocalypse and pirates.  DeMille finds a way to weave it all together and produce a wonderful story.  Plum island also introduces John Corey who will be the focus in other books.<br />  I really enjoy the way that the wit, humor and even sarcasim is blended into the main character as he weaves toward the conclusion of the story.  Also, as per most of the DeMille books, there is twists and turns that make the story unpredictable.  I recommend this book to anyone that likes a good mystery/murder story.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|My grandaughter wanted the movie for her birthday and was excited to receive along with Tink doll and sleeps with her each night! Watches the movie each day!
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Bloody nine fingers is a very interesting character.  He is joined by several more interesting characters in this epic fantasy series.  The Blade Itself starts the story and brings the characters together and, thus, can sometimes be a little slow but it is worth it.  As the story progresses the reader is introduced to the world where the North, the Union and the South are all positioning for war.  Unfortunately, the North and the South have their eyes (separately) on conquest of the Union.  The Union is considered the dominate power in the world but has grown weak due to a fading King and a heavy bureaucratic government.  In steps the Magi Bayez to form a group of adventures that will travel far and wide to help defeat the evil that is posed to overwhelm the Union.  Bayez, Nine Fingers, Ferro and a young Union champion will travel to the edge of the world to bring an end to the eaters which are a power, evil tool of the South.  In book one, you only get a glimpse of the danger that they will face but it is enough to keep the reader wanting more.<br /><br />Overall a good read and I look forward to the second in the series (Before they are hanged).
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love this game!! wish I didn't have to connect with facebook for lives....but I still love the game and of course it's fun!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Since my first computer was a 'trash 80' I can relate to a lot of the material in this book.  I really enjoyed the journey through the 80s and how it was integrated into a quest in modern times.  Ready player one was a fun read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of 80s technology and online gaming.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|One cannot fault Hugo for loving France or Paris, but if it were not for some of the explanations available on my Kindle, I would hot have understood so much of what he wrote. He explained the slang of his time and of the period of which he wrote, and that helped immensely. The underlying romance was sweet, but the changes in the main characters were wonderful. This is a timeless story despite the changes in governments and fashions. Character is still part of man's thinking and acting in this life no matter what else life brings to us.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This series was amazing and had me on the edge of my seat asking question after question the whole time.  Highly recommended.
0143122843|5.0|Arrived in a timely fashion (quickly) and in excellent shape!!  Looking forward to a good read!  I'm fascinated with WWII, as I'm a &#34;War Baby&#34;!!!
B00A2IUHM6|3.0|Look if your in this movie for comedy you get what you ask for, but anything else was sorely disappointing. Their use of accents and raw humor could of been a liitle mor thought out. so overall I give this movie a 3.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun &amp; free. great graphics. hard to get gems though &amp; pop ups are bothersome. otherwise my daughter &amp; I enjoy it alot.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I believe the author should stick to wizardy.This story was difficult to follow and somewhat confusing as to the need of really to story lines. I would not recommend to anyone.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Fun game, I got lost in it for hours when I first started playing it. Now it is still fun after a while but not as fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics in this are amazing and the puzzles are challenging to sure. I did wish there was more to it however. I look forward to a sequel.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Just ok, it kept me watching til the end, but nothing I would really recommend. BruceWillis....he is barely in it
B0091REZMW|2.0|The game is very fun but is CONSTANTLY force closing on my kindle fire which makes me want to just delete it most of the time...yet I don't cause I hope eventually they will get the kinks worked out.
0887431453|5.0|We are a homeschool family and this book is a great value to help my preschool feel like she is doing &#34;school&#34; while her 6 yr old sister is working at our kitchen table. Preschool curriculums can get very expensive and this is a good value for the amount of activities/pages you get.
034580404X|5.0|Excelent. Love Ana and Christian. Can´t wait to see the movie. Woman all over the world can´t get enough of Mr. Grey.
B009AMANBA|3.0|The movie did not mention the rivalry of persons in Lincoln's cabinet.  That was the theme of Doris Kearns Goodwin's book.  The DVD concentrated on the 13th Amendment - the one that ended slavery.  The DVD is two and a half hours long - too long!  I liked the old Raymond Massey movie more.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book is not.my favorite  be it's still very good! Catching fire is my favorite!!! The series is very good
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|There was much too much obscenity spoken in the first half of the film!  Often I had a hard time deciding where the action took place -- the State Department, the CIA, the American Embassy in Tehran, the Canadian ambassador's residence in Tehran?  I bought the movie because I was told it was an award winner.  What a disappointment!
B009X01GJ2|1.0|This is poorly designed protection and makes Kindle hard to handle and is  not useful in using my Kindle effectively.
1594744769|5.0|This novel caught me off guard and went in a totally different direction than I expected.  an enjoyable detour into split reality. Left me wanting more. There's a movie waiting to be made from this book, and there better be another book in this series! I'm waiting
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game to pass the time more fun than I origionally thought I would recommend to anyone who needs to kill time
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Volbeat does it again with a great CD that you can listen to without skipping a song. Excellent vocals and music.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|What a gem! I rarely purchase apps on my Kindle fire, so I was especially pleased to find that this app was high quality and also robust enough that I played it for a couple of weeks on and off before finishing the game. It has excellent graphics, a compelling storyline carried throughout the game, and is the right amount of challenge (not too easy, not too hard). It also has a feature where you can purchase furniture, clothes, and car parts that help your performance as a lawyer. I paid $2.99 for the game, but would have gladly paid up to $5 because I think the value  is so great. I look forward to replaying this game (it has decent replay value too!).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My son introduced me to the hunger games. From the first page of the first book I was reeled in. I really enjoyed the books. Kong live the Mockingjay!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|love this game I like the other ones more but it is still super fun and addictive. a tad more difficult. though
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Instant classic by Daft Punk. Straight up feel good music. Since the first time I heard the song,  I had it stuck on repeat. I highly recommend listening to the song!
B000QXDED6|4.0|COOL MOVIE--STYLIZED ANCIENT MORTAL COMBAT---I RECOMMEND THIS CAUSE IT'S A GUYS MOVIE--JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BLOOD GUTS AND GORE--GRAB A COLD BREW SOME CHIPS AND ENJOY.
B008OP32M6|5.0|I got this for my son last Christmas, the box was missing two of the pieces, but the Lego customer service took care of it very quickly for me. He absolutely loved this gift! I would recommend this to anyone who has a lego fan in their house. It also comes with a second set of instructions so you can make a mac-truck after you make the 4x4 crawler!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I could become addicted to this game & would  give it 5 stars but the ads that pop up between each round are frustrating, ESPECIALLY when you have to let them play.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|The product itself is very well made. It feels comfortable and doesn't feel cheap. The stand is OK it has to be on a flat surface and sometimes falls back if you shake the table too hard.<br />The only thing bad about this product is that it only works with some games. So unless you're a hardcore gamer do not buy.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is one of those games that I had to play every spare minute until I finished it. It's great in that way. However, although some levels are more challenging than others, there's no consistent, gradual increase in difficulty. Instead, it's just hit-or-miss whether or not you're about to play a tougher puzzle.<br /><br />For me, the story is irrelevant. In fact, I skipped over every dialogue. They could have just left out the story and named the game something entirely different. The puzzles are what the game is really all about.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I enjoyed this CD, its got a few better songs than are just played on the radio.  If you like 'atmosphere' this cd is for you.
6305212112|5.0|This was a gift for my grandfather on his 89th birthday, he loves this movie but hadn't seen it in a long time.<br /><br />This is to me a very particular movie, there's comedy, tragedy, murder, drama and romance. All in my opinion very well balanced.<br /><br />Hope you like it
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I got this a few weeks ago..I have played it today for the first time..it is a good game to play at the doctors office or anywhere you might want to spend a little time playing a game..I like this kind of game to play when I just want to sit down and rest for a few minutes..it is a game that does not have a lot to think about to play it so it kind of relaxes me..
B001543L92|5.0|22 years ago a friend lend me this album in vinyl and it was tough to give back. I had never heard that kind of noise. For years I've been trying to improve my record colection and decided that some albums I really needed to buy on this vinyl format. It's great I recommend it and the packaging works, your albums will get to you in one piece and in perfect conditions.
0062082353|4.0|Towns and shooting started to run together. After a while I got lost in all the great shooting he did, super human.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|In all honesty, I was excited when this edition came out - however, lacking a BluRay player, I could not purchase it. I didn't understand why the company only offered it on BluRay, but I can see why now, only after watching it.<br /><br />The first time I watched Advent Children, I was confused with the best of them. I enjoyed the movie to some extent, but felt it lacked a strong plot. It was also bleak, compared to the amazing heart the original game had. 'Fan Service' described it quite well.<br /><br />The 26 extra minutes in this version, however, make a world of difference. The origins of Geostigma - and Cloud's mental breakdown over it - really come to life, and you are left with a strong sense of sympathy. In addition, Denzel's backstory really hits the nail on the head. When I watched the original version, I thought the story dragged on, and I felt it was essentially one long, drawn out battle. The extra content adds a wonderful balance of story-versus-action, perfecting the movie's pacing and making it more enjoyable to watch overall.<br /><br />The new and revised scenes are so beautiful it's actually heartbreaking. Square Enix makes the most of BluRay's incredible ability to render God-like quality. But I took off one star because they did not bother to update the whole movie to BluRay quality. And holy crap, there is a jarring difference between the old scenes and new scenes. Luckily, the new ones are so good they are forgivable...but only by a hair, in my book.<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan who is craving for the full picture of this FFVII extension, definitely go for it. It's been out long enough by this point, so the price won't break the bank too much.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|An interesting perspective on the franchise.  You still see your beloved Master Chief, but you get a lot more background and a decent plot to the war itself.
1401216676|5.0|A very well made comic and the deluxe edition it's just as great as the story. It also smells great :)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I enjoyed Downton Abbey and have all three seasons  This is a excellent show.  However, was not happy with ending
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Throughout this series I've constantly had tons of questions about Mac's family, the confusing chemistry with Barrons, and the conflicting battle between good and evil. They were most all answered, but I finished the series with the excitement with the depth, plot, character development and much more. I would highly recommend this series to anyone that's looking for a great deep read that gets you thinking about the story, even when you're away from it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have trouble getting up in the morning, so music really helps! the dimness settings are amazing, and its so easy to access everything. I reccomend this app.
B00947N6UG|3.0|I purchased the blu ray DVD combo for my kids a couple weeks ago. They have only watched it once. Although they seemed interested the first time, and asked lots o questions; they have not asked to watch if again. My kids are 5 and 3 and just thought the movie was ok. Not one destined to be a classic.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson nailed it. Robert Jordan created the most wonderfully epic landscape with an amazing storyline. And people can say what they want about Sanderson just filling in the blanks. He wrote it beautifully. I mean what else is there to say....It was positively EPIC!!!
1451695195|4.0|I think this is very thought provoking book.  If you have ever questioned whether there is an afterlife this book will not necessarily answer that question in a concrete way but it will make you  think of the possibilities.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies that is full of good fun while teaching some rules of behavior. A great family movie. I loved how Nanny McPhee arrives as a homely woman and has the job of trying to control the out of control children but after the children learn a specific rule, some of the homeliness goes away and in the end she is a beautiful lady. I would highly recommend this movie.
B0030CMK8A|5.0|I liked this book.  I also read this author's baby book.  She calls the reader &#34;luv&#34; and says &#34;mummy&#34; but I didn't find it distracting.  Many things in this book are common sense but it's helpful to hear them and there are a lot of stories/examples that were helpful.  I would recommend this book to others.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun game whenever one has a few minutes. It is fast and entertaining. It gets progressively harder as one proceeds through the levels.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not a Stephen King horror book fan; however, I loved the imagination of The Stand when I read it 20+ years ago, and I loved this book similarly.  I am a distracted and not a fast reader, so over the months I was reading this, I told my co-workers, friends, and family about how I was enjoying it.  My mother grew up in Dallas area in the timeframe, and my Dad grew up in a small town south of Dallas, so perhaps I liked that relationship as well.  I intend to convince them they should read this too.
B0048KXRR6|4.0|This was a light hearted family friendly movie. Wasn't quite as good as the original Nanny McPhee movie but close.
1608955702|5.0|I've been working with flash for a while and this book has definitely helped me take my lighting to a new level.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you have yet to see this show and are simply browsing, heed my words:  pause and purchase.<br /><br />Amazing characters + multiple storylines + skilled strorytelling = outstanding show.<br /><br />Trust me.  By this.. By the blu-ray version :)
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is an amazingly talented artist.  I first heard a few of her songs on Pandora, and immediately needed to purchase her CD.  It did not disappoint.  She is incredibly talented, and I have a feeling that we will be hearing more from her in the future.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|So thankful that this quality show is available and can therefore be streamed from any device.<br />The history lover in me loves the obvious attention to details of the set and characters.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This movie is made for the true history buff. It only covers Lincoln getting the 13th ammmendment passed. Daniel Day Lewis does a brillant job of playing Lincoln....and keeps the movie on course. The movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes long...but if you love learning about Lincoln time flies right by.<br />  If you need the perfect gift for the person who loves history, here you go!  Amazon had the best price and got it to me super quick! I paid for the 3 day delivery... it cost me less than $3.00...I can't drive to the store for that.<br />  I feel I may have a greater sense of appreciation for the movie since I was fortunate enough to hear Steven Spielberg and Doris Kearns Goodwin speak at Gettysburg.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I truly enjoyed this story.  The plot kept me trying to determine what was going to happen.  A great suspense.
B001TODO54|1.0|Well, ... Disappointment is an understatement. This is defiantly the kind of book for me with a strong female lead and a bit of romance. I didn't think it was possible to ruin that lovely combination but they managed. I was looking for something similar to Game of Thrones or Legend but this wasn't even close. It really should have been written from fist person or switching back and forth between Kat and Po ... Oh and 'Kat' and 'Seven Kingdoms'? Good try but you can't stand up to GOT unless you learn to write. Sorry for the bad review but I would like to warn others even though it could have been an excellent book if it was made with some depth.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Mr Lewis was awesome in the movie. What a cast ! In every scene I recognized an actor I've seen before. However.... this movie sins the worst movie sin there is. It gets long and boring in the middle.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a good game.  I think it is fun.  Entertaining like something that excites. Words that I wrote explain what this game means to me.  Hooray for cows and other livestock.<br /><br />Poop<br />Lobotomy<br />Ostrich<br />Teachers<br />Twenty word limit sucks my.....
B009HNDSL4|5.0|I nearly busted a gut watching these shows. Now Im hooked on the series and don't miss it. You'll get hooked too !
B00000DSEK|4.0|I wanted to complete my collection. What else can you say, it is Ozzy and Ozzy is of course great!
0553384775|5.0|My husband loved this book.  He read this in a couple days and is ready to read the next one.
B00004RJ71|1.0|I bought this for my husband. He was very excited, opened the box, the wrong movie was inside. We were very disappointed
B003VANOFY|5.0|I thought I would get all sorts of interference from router and phones and such but there was none.  The product works great, sounds great, easy to install, buttons are easy to use and the boom mic flips out of the way to auto-mute.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing. I'm speechless, this was so beautifully written that I'm speechless. Definitely worth reading and I just can't explain it in a way for the next reader to fully understand how great this is!
0312370849|5.0|This book kept me interested from the very beginning.  It's full of historical facts and has a surprise ending.  Read it and you<br />won't be disappointed.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Love this app!! Aside from 1 problem, while I open texts to respond.. I'll start typing and nothing shows up?!?! what's going on with that?? it never happened before last update and it's rather aggravating :( Please fix and you'll get the 5 stars you deserve
B000050GQA|5.0|It came on time and is a terrific movie.  I would order again.  I also got the Sandlot and my whole family enjoyed it.
B000JSI7C6|1.0|Bad acting.  Not much of a story line.  Way too much cursing.<br /><br />Watched it once and never will watch it again.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Have not stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Fantastic. Engaging for adults and simple for children. May even be a little educational!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Lots to do, but be careful.  It wants you to spend money. Hard to move forward just on what you can earn in the game. Fun.<br /><br />Edit after playing a while (up to level 24): Geez, this game is buggy! You slowly lose the ability to load ANY ally or enemy base. All you get is the annoying \\"Failed to load <ally/enemy> base\\" message. This means you can't gather hearts by putting out ally fires, and you can't invade enemy bases to plunder gold. VERY frustrating. The other MOST annoying bug is that it simply DOES NOT remember where you are in the game. Sometimes you can force it to remember by fully exiting out of the game (not just \\"home screen button\\". But that doesn't work reliably either. So you frequently lose position, accomplishments and resources. Even ones you've bought. Cool game, but very poorly implemented. And the \\"pay to play\\" currency (gold stars) are just WAY too rare and too expensive to have the game just randomly forget that they exist. When you've spent real money for funny-game-money there's an element of rip-off in an app that just drops it off the face of the earth. I will probably be uninstalling it unless I see a really good update really soon.<br /><br />Edit after playing some more (7/2/2013): Got an update, and miraculously was able to load other bases again. But over time, this deteriorates and once again, I can only load a few ally bases, and no enemy bases. And since a day ago, when I turn the game on, it announces that an update is available. If I click the \\"update\\" button, it takes me to the Amazon AppStore, which doesn't have any updates for the game, just \\"Open\\". When I \\"Open\\" the game, it sticks at 3% for a while, then goes into a \\"Unable to connect to server - OK to retry\\" loop and will never connect. This is likely NOT my connection as everything else works fine, and I have also tried it over various wifi and 4G connections. With luck, maybe the Amazon App Store will catch up and make the latest update available... BTW, they DIDaddress the data loss bug as far as I can tell. And they added an explicit \\"power Off\\" button to exit the game. Much improved except for the current \\"useless\\" state.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|had a high score &amp; wanted to post it via my kindle. It went berserk and shut down. I thought I had encountered a virus.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Cute, fun and entertaing. Good thing it's not timed as I get caught up watching rether than figuring out the puzzle sometimes
B0067QPVJ6|1.0|in my opinion the remake of THE THING just doesn't<br />live up to it two previous predicessossors,<br />sure the gore is there but the storyline isn't.  Stick to the orginial, \\"The Thing from another World\\"  for true sci-fi eeriness. Also, John Carpenter's The 2nd Thing\\" blows all three movies away. Love Kurt Russel in his role.<br />THE ONLY REEEMING QUALITY PART anout this movie was the superb acting  of ERIC CHRISTIAN OLSEN<br />he saved an otherwise poorly put tother film
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers is a brilliant movie that draws together the best actors and the best director to create a wonderful movie that makes you laugh, or cry and gasp with the characters.
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|It's not that I hate the album, it just seems like he is still stuck in the 1980's. I don't think that he has ever released an album like this one where I can't listen to it at all. I guess what I am trying to say is that the album is very lukewarm and boring and almost all the songs sounds the same. He sounds bored in all the songs. David Bowie needs to reinvent himself like he did in the 1980's. I understand that Let's Dance was released 30 years ago when he reinvented himself, but if he was able to reinvent himself once he can reinvent himself again. He still has the talent but he isn't showing us his talent anymore. We don't want a great singer who will keep on putting out boring crap music. Die-hard Bowie fans will of course be die-hard Bowie fans and will defend him and insult me by calling me some dubstep or top 40 listener but the truth is it doesn't matter what genre you listen to. What matters is that you enjoy a form of music. Now I don't listen to either dubstep or top 40 but Bowie has great talent and he can reinvent himself again and make good music but this album doesn't show it. He isn't washed up but if his next album is just as bad as this one, then it's questionable.
B00AFEY354|4.0|Perks is a brilliant movie that explores the darkness that attaches itself to previously abused children, and the lightness they find together.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Not too hard,but it gives you some challenges. Colorful scenes, many different objects to clear off the board, keeps your interest. Plays fairly long. Worth the price!!
B001HN6922|5.0|My son watches this movie daily.  It is great and we got a good deal.  It was quick to get here and new!
B0053KWDES|2.0|Say you have on the one hand a neat mp3 player like an iPad. On the other hand you have earbuds that are pretty good (say 5 to 25Khz frequency response), why would you put a weak 20-20Khz amplifier in between the two? You get my point, useless, even detrimental...
0062502182|5.0|Very spiritual and thorough look at the bright side of the street. I would highly recommend and suggest to family and friends
B00881PTRC|4.0|I like this game. Always have liked the hangman games! This is somewhat challenging and easy to navigate. Easy way to pass the time for a quick game here and there.
0071752854|5.0|This is a really interesting read but I'm having a hard time seeing how to use it in a non-presentation personal setting, like email marketing.<br /><br />I've made a lot of technical presentations in my time, using well-developed techniques that make it hard for me to bear the usual boring presentations others make.<br /><br />But I'm at a loss on how to translate the ideas in this great book into the context of email marketing.<br /><br />Any suggestions are welcome...
B0094K1MH2|5.0|What an entertaining movie with fascinating technique. My 8 yr old son loves it and so do I. Already watched it 5 times.
B00005JNS0|4.0|My grandson, as well as my husband and I enjoyed viewing the movie.  We can't count anymore the amount of times we've seen it!
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I have bought many CD's that were remastered: Kinks, Zombies, Cream, CCR, Pink Floyd. I have a fairly high end digital system that helps me appreciate these great R&R Classic Artist's. Especially when properly remastered of course. This 3 CD collection will blow you away with the sound quality for 1970's / 1980's recordings. My Van Morrison red book CD's are never going to be played again. Unless I want to demo the difference between them ( no pun )and the remastered cuts on this collection. Jeez, I missed this for over 4 years !

B001P1MZNI|5.0|I've liked Frank Sinatra for some time. This live album is really good.  It showcases Frank's voice and style and includes some interesting dialog.  I found this very entertaining and really indicative of the time in shich it was recorded.  Listening to the story telling you are quickly reminded of Sinatra's roots.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Sad to say but 90% of this so called book was lifted off of History Channels documentary on Tesla.<br /><br />Literally passages are word for word.<br />Blatant plagiarism. I don't support this and have no interest in purchasing his other books which were most likely plagiarized as well. Fail.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I wanted an everyday watch that was durable, nice and that I didn't have to replace batteries in (mostly because I am just too lazy to replace batteries)... this watch fit the bill and i've worn it every day since getting it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|this story tapped into my ideal romance.  i had a hard time with the conflict part because it hit so close too home and then the ending was a bit bitter sweet because in real life that's not how things usually work out.  this is the kind of romance most of us dream of- to have someone almost immediately see  you're worth fighting for, that none of your flaws make you less lovable, an that love can triumph over baggage.  it's a well written little romance.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Given the acting talent, I was pretty pumped up to see this film in the build up to its release, but generally mediocre reviews kept me away from the theatre.  After getting around to seeing it now, I agree with the prevailing view that the movie is a decent piece of popcorn entertainment but that it seems content to settle for well-worn tropes and ultimately offers virtually nothing to distinguish it from a trough of other gangster films.  The plot is a formulaic 'malevolent gangster versus vigilante cops' and the dialogue is a second-rate Hammett that at times is cringe-inducing.  What makes it a worthwhile viewing experience in spite of those deficiencies are the frequent and well-executed action sequences, which, if a bit silly and over-the-top at times, are really fun to watch.  Also, the film develops a solid atmosphere through well-executed sets, music, and wardrobe.<br /><br />Most of the characters are fairly one-dimensional, which does not give the actors much room for nuance.  Out of the leads, Sean Penn puts in the stand-out performance as mobster Mickey Cohen.  He seems to relish playing a truly diabolical dude.  Josh Brolin does pretty well as the simmering, itchy trigger fingered good guy, but I think Russell Crowe put in a more complex and interesting performance with a similar role in 'LA Confidential'.  With little room for exploration given the source material, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone seem content to phone in their respective roles as suave, carefree partner and femme fatale.<br /><br />Overall, if you're like me and you find it intrinsically enjoyable to watch gangsters fire tommy guns at one another, you won't regret putting in the two hours to watch this movie.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|WONDERFUL HO and Adventure game. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys these types of games and are familiar with them. Great storyline, harder than usual puzzles, and a new real ' expert' mode- meaning it won't highlight the ho scenes If you don't want. Really great graphics on my Kindle Fire and NO glitches. I did download the free version first to make sure I'd like it and I did; therefore, I paid for the game, knowing full well I had too :) I have 4 stars only because it could have been a little longer for the price, not even a bonus chapter. Anyway, Going to look for my next game now! It will be a challenge, as I play a lot of these games!!!
B000JRYOPG|4.0|First time watching this movie and I must say, it was really good. Even though I couldn't really understand what they were saying, I was still glued to the movie. I hope they make a Shottas 2. I recommend this movie to everyone.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I started and abandoned this book 3 times before I managed to muster sufficient courage to get past the opening chapters, where the shocking details of the Hunger Games were described.  The concept is beyond harrowing and, as a mother, I found it almost impossible to continue.  I eventually reminded myself that this is in fact a work of fiction and that many of the books I read during my studies were equally horrifying and had closer ties to reality (any Holocaust themed novel would fall into this category).  So I forced myself to get through the opening chapters and I am so pleased that I did.<br /><br />\\"I couldn't put it down\\" must be the most overused phrase in book reviews but, the truth is, I genuinely could not put this book down.  I was completely engrossed in the plot and experienced every emotion felt by the heroine Katniss.  What a survivor!  She is a role-model for EQ (Emotional Intelligence for those of you that are not familiar with a current business fad!).  She is capable of enduring the most devastating setbacks without retreating into self-pity or victim mode. Imagine if you could teach your children that skill?<br /><br />The Hunger Games is, at its essence, a book about survival.  A corrupt government forces children to battle it out to the death in a \\"Reality\\" show.  Katniss and Peeta find themselves competing in the Hunger Games and we see  the horror through the eyes of Katniss.  It is a very well written book and the main character Katniss is beautifully developed.  Peeta is not as well developed but, since the book is told from Katniss's perspective, that is to be expected.  The supporting characters have just sufficient depth to be interesting. The most important supporting character is Gale, Katniss Everdeen's best friend and hunting partner, prior to the Games.  Gale is is also a survivor, but his survival is expressed through anger and rebellion.  The foundation for the love-triangle that will be fully explored in the next two books of the trilogy, are firmly established in this opening book.<br /><br />In the apocalyptic/post apocalyptic or dystopian genre, this book definitely number 1 in my opinion. This is not a book that you read this for enjoyment but rather for a sense of justice and victory!d in the next two books of the trilogy, are firmly established in this opening book.<br /><br />In the apocalyptic/post apocalyptic or dystopian genre, this book definitely number 1 in my opinion.

B000YH6YG8|5.0|This movie is an all time classic.  I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and it motivated me to conduct myself in a more responsible manor for fear of going down and taking my family with me.  American History X is more of an educational experience than entertainment.  Every young adult should see it at least once.

B003F48E4W|5.0|The Lost Boys is just great 80's cinema. Some people have called it a time capsule for that decade, and I have to agree. Its just a classic of the vampire genre. Its well written, well directed, and perfectly cast. The stand out here is a young Keifer Sutherland, in one of his earliest roles and LONG before he was fighting terrorism on the home front. Jami Gertz is just stunning. No, these vampires don't sparkle. They don't mope over true love. They don't stand around mugging at each other. These vampires would kick some sparkly you know what. Frankly, this is what every vampire movie should aspire to be. My only complaint is that we never got a prequel or a decent sequel.
0786956127|4.0|This wilderness set is perfect if you're looking to order new tile sets and not sure which on to get.<br /><br />1. It comes in a box that also has images on it- so I use it to hold all my tiles plus it can be used as tiles (a 3D cliff effect)<br /><br />2. You can combine it with Sinister Woods set and other ones to make a huge outdoor area.<br /><br />3. Comes with rivers, ponds, paths, cabin, trees, trenches, &#34;Stone Hedge&#34; tile, etc.<br /><br />The only downfalls I see with this are that it doesn't come with enough paths and river pieces to make them turn and bend. Also, I think that there is too many fire pieces (I would have preferred different forest-y elements).<br /><br />It's still a must-have. You won't be disappointed.

It was difficult to get through and at the end I really did not care about a single person in the book. If the preview thing is available, do that first because it never gets any better than that.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|While others have written outstanding detailed reviews of Zero Dark Thirty, a few have touched on Ultraviolet.  The bottom line:  it's the worst new digital ecosystem ever created.<br />You have to create two accounts, one for Flixster and one for UV and then log into Flixster then the UV site.  I did this and was still unable to get this movie to play.  Flixster kept telling<br />me that I needed to log into the UV site.  I have worked with this for over a month, contacted Flixster who told me it was a UV issue.  UV wouldn't even respond to my e-mail.  I'm done with<br />anything having to do with UV, this is by far the worst content delivery system ever developed.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|My significant other had this to say about this movie: This is a good movie if you only want to see one aspect of Lincoln's life. There are many issues with this movie on the historical side. They portray the Civil War as being only over slavery when in fact it was largely over state's rights. Several of the states in the south did not have slaves, but all so-called historical movies have some fiction in it.<br /><br />I found this movie to be slow and rather long and drawn out. I found the most enjoyable scene to be the one where congress votes on the Thirteenth Amendment.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|It's probably functional for posting listed songs to Facebook, but I can do that directly from my music sites and apps I use for listening to music and ringtones. I got it because it claimed to record audio. I was hoping to record a program on a webcast, from my chromebook, which has it as a Chrome app. (That may be a factor in the functionality). It was a difficult journey to find where go record audio at all. Once I actually recorded the audio, there was no way to save it, except to post it on Facebook. I'm grateful I had the sense to record the webcast from my android via evernote, just in case. Also, within minutes of creating an account to access this rather pointless app., I was notified that some creepy guy was following me on it and I started getting spam scammer emails. I do not recommend this application.

0446693804|5.0|A Walk To Remember is a book by a brilliant author who knows how to get emotion out of people. Nicholas has you so caught up in the story that you want to keep reading until your to the very last page. His books can even bring you to tears or laugh out loud. He has made so many books that have turned into movies. If you love romance/ drama books than Nicholas Sparks is a perfect author for you. No wonder why he is a best seller!<br />A Walk To Remember is a book that is based in the spring time of 1958. The book which is also a movie was made in 2002. The book and movie is about two teenagers in their senior year of high school in Beaufort, North Carolina who fall in love. Landon Carter, a guy that has good intentions but can get into trouble quite a lot thinks he's fallen in love with a girl or two but when he meets Jamie Sullivan that all changes. Jamie Sullivan is the town minister's daughter. People at school give her a hard time because she's always looked at as a goody goody with a bible shoved in her face.  When Landon gets into trouble he has to many different things to not be suspended from Beaufort High School. He has to help kids with school work after school and do the school play, which Jamie is in. The night of the play when Jamie sings Landon realizes that he's in love with her. He makes a few mistakes along the way but ends up dating Jamie.  Jamie soon after has no choice but to tell Landon that she has been diagnosed with leukemia. After Landon finds out he stays at Jamie's beck and call. Landon soon asks Jamie to marry him and they get married in the same church that Jamie's parents did. Unfortunally, Jamie only lived until the rest of that summer, but Landon and Jamie made the best of everything. Jamie changed Landon's life and he is a mature, responsible adult. He can still feel his wife's presentences around him. If she had never in his life he wouldn't be the man he is today.<br /> While reading this book I just wanted to keep reading until I got to the last page. I couldn't put it down. While reading I laughed and I was even was brought to tears. I recommend anyone to read this book who loves romance/ drama books. It is truly phenomenal!<br />This book is romance/ drama. It is about two young teenagers who fall in love and will do anything to make one another happy. They have many conflicts that they conquer. They teens end up married but sadly the wife dies from leukemia. The husband still misses his wife and doesn't want anyone else. If he and his wife had never crossed paths he wouldn't be the man that he is today.<br />This book is phenomenal and I recommend it for anyone to read. You won't be disappointed.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|Bill Murray and Bruce Willis together and yet neither of them steals the show from the great kid actors. Fabulous photography, in my view this move is true art.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is an excellent movie based on a true story.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.  My husband and I bought this movie for each of our kids.  I watch it over and over...it's one of those movies that each time you watch it you get more out of the movie...or you catch some detail you didn't catch before.  5 Stars Plus on this one!  I'd recommend it to anyone, but there is some language at the start that parents might determine is not appropriate for younger kids.
B00340ESIS|5.0|I heard about this book while attending a documentary film festival. The doc maker talked about having editing problems and a friend gave him a copy of this book and it pulled him out of a morass. As I am a doc maker myself, I thought I would look into it. When I saw that it was focused on the structure of screenplays, I wondered if it was really relevant.  I need not have worried. This book could be subtitled, How To Tell a Great Story.  It works for anything you want to put into classic story form. It wouldn't be appropriate for something like Cinema Verite but it works in many, many cases.<br /><br />Snyder writes with great humor and a refreshing amount of humility. He is a top Hollywood screenwriter but also willing to laugh at himself as he struggled up the learning curve. The book is a quick read but it contains much wisdom. I highly recommend it.

B002RI9ZRC|5.0|Manjit Kumar's 'Quantum' is a masterful exploration of the development of quantum physics over the course of the Twentieth Century.<br /><br />Kumar's achievement is to entwine the historical human drama with clear descriptions of such difficult scientific and philosophical concepts.  His narrative moved at pace and kept me rivetted throughout, yet he was always accurate in his treatment of scientific concepts.<br /><br />I have studied quantum physics at university, knew all the names and theories, and even applied them as an electronics engineer.  However, Kumar's historical narrative is the first book that really explained to me the detailed historical \\"how, where and why\\" of these ideas, which lie at the heart of the modern world.<br /><br />He also communicates the human conflict that fuelled the development of these ideas: both inter-personal, but more importantly the personal philosophical commitments that drove all theoreticians from Planck onward.  One can't truly understand the scientific process without understanding that personal and inter-personal drama, which Kumar provides in spades.  Perhaps more importantly, his history might show us how we remain unconsciously enthralled to modern dogmas that hold us in cognitive chains.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is minor but relevant.  Kumar frequently discusses Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics in terms of \\"consistency\\" and \\"incompleteness\\".  These are essential concepts, which I understand to be crucially linked to Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems.  Gödel and Einstein regularly discussed the implications of Gödel's mathematical work, yet Gödel barely receives a mention.  I think that the book would have been stronger still if the Gödel-Einstein connection had been explored.<br /><br />Similarly, I would have liked a bit more exploration of the formal philosophical influences on the \\"great names\\" in physics, where relevant.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I have no hesitation in recommending this work to anyone interested in the scientific process, quantum physics, historical adventure, or someone who is curious and simply after a great read.

It played to all of my geeky tendencies.<br /><br />If you grew up spending quarters at the arcade, with calluses in the crook of your thumb from your Atari 2600 joystick, listening to Rush and not understanding why everyone else wasn't doing the same thing then this book is a bowl of Pop Rocks, Mike and Ikes, and Lemonheads (geek flavored) with an ice-cold, glass bottle of Pepsi (before it was the &#34;choice of a new generation&#34;).<br /><br />It's not great literature but it struck all the right chords with me.

B00BUCW54Q|4.0|While some of the &#34;conclusions&#34; drawn during the analysis of certain situations confronted were a &#34;long reach&#34;, the pace of the film trumped them.  A typical Tom Cruise cuisine served up with decent acting, good story line and &#34;keep-'em-guessing&#34; plots.  Choreography of actions scenes made them almost believable.  The film is not for the intellectual - and it wasn't designed as such - just a good-tempo, action genre entertainment for the crowd that LOVES them.

B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Absolute garbage - couldn't get past the first 30 minutes.<br />Waste of time and money and not funny.<br />Skip it.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I went from watching the first few seasons on Netflix and got so hooked I had to find it.. Thank GOODNESS for Amazon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't know much about this game but my 6 year old son loves it.  He plays a computer version along with this pocket edition.  If it makes him happy, it makes me happy.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Realistic great game. It goes slow unless you buy coins. But lots of fun. I am glad they don't charge for building roads. The missions are exciting.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I thought it was going to be more documentary like, but this was a great movie. It's a great account of recent history, which we all lived. I think everyone should watch this!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I just started watching.  Seasons One, Two, and Three all on Prime. Now I am waiting for Season Four to come out.  It is a great drama,  with characters that we can easily relate to.  It has interesting law cases, intertwined with the family story lines.  I would call it more of a Chick Flick Series, but I honestly do believe that men will like it also. I need to qualify that it is intended for mature audiences.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Interesting movie, plenty of action and visual effects. Wondering how long it will be before the next one comes out.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Enjoyed it very much can't wait for the next hunger game movie<br />comes out. Very good acting and action. Very good
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I have really enjoyed the book, and it is so handy to have on Kindle.  The book is written so each character has a first person telling of the chapter which allows for each character to develop fully.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Took me to rural Ireland and a cast of different characters.  Also, had a nice twist at the end.  A fun read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was awesome and I greatly enjoyed the drama and suspense in it. I think the movie will be epic
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Not as good as percy jackson. By the way anyone read percy jackson????? U should.I loved this book. Percy is hot
B0042O85ES|5.0|you get a great captured performance by the stones at their peak, great documentary about the making of the album, great commentary about the exile album, great poster, great scarf! seriously, what more could you ask?
0345529057|5.0|The books keep you guesting what is going to happen. One minute you think the Stark are going to win. But then it turn out they do not.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Not exactly sure what kick Tarantino is on. First he wins WWII for the Jews, now he's gone after slavery with the same revisionist enthusiasm. What historical atrocity will he rewrite next? The Armenian Holocaust maybe? Or maybe this time the Aztecs can heroically fend off Cortez.<br /><br />You wont learn much about America's history from this film, but its kinda entertaining, though without the same wit that Pulp Fiction or even True Romance had.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Early chapters with descriptions of prison camp are tough to read but the remainder of the book is excellent.  Good background for the present news reports from North Korea.
B00004XPPC|5.0|We rdered this just before a trip to Thailand and it made the tour of the bridge and the train ride over the bridge much more interesting.  A classic film.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars. It was a great love story with a twist to it.  Looking forward to the sequel.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|We ordered this film before our trip to Northern Australia and it made the trip more interesting.  We fell in love with Australia.  We could not understand why this film was not more well received in the US.  We thought it a great epic film about many different issues.  Good for conversations.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book stole my heart, and I can't wait to read it from Holders point of view.  Colleen Hoover makes you feel what the characters are feeling  and you fall in love with them over and over again.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|The author did not beat his idea into my head on every page.  He told his story and what he did without repeating, and repeating making the book twice as long.  I saw his episode on PBS about the diet - very good.  Worth the money.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book generated the best book club discussion we have had in three years. Great character development as well as a moral dilemma, which bought it various viewpoints. It is a page turner and a must read.
B00BKRON5K|2.0|Author keeps going over the same points over and over, very annoying. Sample meal plans for second and third stages are unreadable on my Kindle.  Shows only headlines, blank or partially showing on right side of screen. Reads same on Kindle app and on my desk top computer.  Please fix and allow all of us to upload revised book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP! It is so much better than Temple Run 1! I stay awake at night just to play this! I may be addicted!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|We love Bourne series, and watched the first three movies many times over. This one is watchable, but not as entertaining as the previous ones.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this is areally fun game the kids love it and its totally free easy to level up and finish quests. its a good download fortitude being free
B000N90JGI|4.0|Liked it but it is predictable.  The actors are good as always.  But this movie is very predictable.  You know the next move.
B0017O1MIM|4.0|Picture quality is amazing.  I really enjoyed the book included.  However, ULTRAVIOLET was a big disappointment.  I really thought I was getting a digital version that I could use on multiple devices just as I had with other movies that include a digital copy.  You don't get a file that you can load into your iPad or iPhone but instead a get an application downloaded that can play the movie but the file itself is not visible (at least I could not find it).  The download itself was incredibly slow from the ULTRAVIOLET site to compound the frustration.  So buy this for the extras but don't get your hopes up about ULTRAVIOLET.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|This was an ok movie.  It was very predictable which usually don't hold my interest.  But, I watch this to the end.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Last night's movie was \\"Breaking Away,\\" a wonderful DVD I picked up in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was an excellent movie, but I particularly liked it because it paralleled a lot of my youth experience. I grew up in a town having a major university. I went to Junior and Senior High School in Boulder, Colorado, and the University of Colorado was only a couple blocks from the High School. Such towns are simply over-run with young people and the youngsters split into two well-defined groups that have little to do with one another: those that are attending college and those who are not. There's a bit of a status problem here with the latter group clearly being on the bottom, and it shows. I managed to somewhat bridge the gap in that I was from Boulder and living at home, but I was also going to CU. I quickly found that revealing my Boulder roots was not cool. The university young people considered Boulder people as the local yokals. In any case, this movie depicts the division of young people and their differences very well, although the University is Indiana and the town is Bloomington. It's very well done and the director had a keen eye. About the only flaw I saw in the depiction it was the parents of one boy (Dennis Christopher) were depicted in an overly corny way, especially the father (Paul Dooley). Otherwise, the acting on the part of all the young people, both university and not, was exceptionally good. Oh, and by the way, the movie has a very enjoyable musical background.<br /><br />It's a simple, somewhat painful, story of growing up and finding your place in the world. Christopher plays a talented if somewhat eccentric bicycle racer who ultimately enters a university-sponsored relay bike race and wins finishing in front of all university people. It's exciting and fun to watch. The whole movie is very well put together and enjoyable. Everything about it (with the minor exception of the parents) is first rate.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B000ID3E9S|1.0|Did not like it. So disappointed in a Reece movie.  This is not a recommendable movie.  Too ridiculous.  Not worth the time.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I read the book a few months ago and just found myself comparing the book to the movie the whole time. blah...
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Except for a few portions of the film where the dialogue was difficult to hear because of background noise (very common these days), the film was exceptional.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Intrigue and mystery coupled with the secret ingredient of smart characters!  Highly recommend.  I look forward to reading the next Lee Child novel.
0792844890|5.0|This is easily in my top 10 films.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this movie, it's a freaking Mel's Brooks film, C'MOOOON MAN!
B009AMANBA|4.0|This was a very interesting film that depicted an important part of our American history. Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones were particularly good in their roles.
0316743003|4.0|Aside from detailing the development of stealth technology, this chronicles what happened with Pentagon spending and how it worked back during the latter quarter of the last century.  Rich does a good job nailing down the environment, criticizing those who deserve criticism and providing suggestions for how this country can improve certain things.  It has an applicability beyond military production and spending and is well worth the time spent reading it.
0547564651|3.0|This book has some very good new ideas but most of it covered material that I had already read elsewhere.
0061655554|5.0|I know next to nothing about the machinations of big business.  This book was excellent in explaining all the maneuvering that went on with RJR Nabisco.  I was captivated from the opening chapter and to this day remember parts of it. The movie HBO did did no justice to the topic and almost made it look like a farce.  There were certainly comedic elements to it but this was deadly serious business to those involved.  It's a wonderful book.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I love Leonard Cohen's style of singing and the backup group does a wonderful job.  I  listen to this music while I am driving and find it very relaxing.
0465068367|5.0|If you believe the apologists who insist that this didn't happen, you're deluding yourself.  There is far too much evidence to suggest that this was a scam.  Much like the deniers of the Holocaust, there are external reasons for refusing to believe that this happened.<br /><br />That being said, this book is a compelling and necessary addition to World War II literature.  It's hard to read and even harder to believe.  Whatever your reaction to the story Chang tells, don't believe for a second that it didn't happen.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a great device -<br />It's powerful enough to charge a tablet, be it an ipad 1-4, nexus 7/10, etc at the same time as a phone<br />The devices show AC (fast) charging rather than USB, and charge just as fast as on regular power...I actually prefer the usb inputs because I can use any cable - 30pin, lightning, microusb etc based on the need that day
B005R32L66|5.0|great program. we loved it! We you it all the time with no issues. I recommend it to every one.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|it's a calculator and it works. many functions. great app to have and i need five more words so bye.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ... FUNNY MOVIE ... WILL WATCH OVER & OVER AGAIN .... YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR PURCHASE ... I KNOW I DIDN'T ...
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great as the title says. whenever this one runs out i will definitely order another one. i love the diamond rod if used properly it can really sharpen things up but the grooves work nicely too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A great brain workout with peaceful eyesoothing graphics. Exquisite in its simplicity. A new Sunday morning must that exceeds expectations.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Great game almost gets a little boring but then they throw a curve in some form or another. overall good game and i got it as the free app of the day so i cant really complain.
0425238091|3.0|Insight to New interns in a large hospital and how some patients are GOMERS and definately not welcome. Mainly old patients are not tolerated well. Gomer stand for GET OUT OF MY E.R.. Like any other business there are those who want to do their job as best as possible and others with less care. Interesting but a little too much time spent on the sexual lifes of these young doctors.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well written and visual. Great twist...and I knew one was coming. The book caused many questions while reading.  I will be interested to see what reflections I have on it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great alarm clock wakes me up every morning with no problem, even if in another room. I'm very hard to wake up.

Cold POP!
1609611543|5.0|My son needed this book for a research paper for school. Unfortunately all my local libraries had a waiting list to check out this book. I loved all the information that was found throughout this informative book.
0525953728|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much.  It is enlightening to know some of whatour Military personnel have to endure for the love of this country.  We need to have appreciation for them
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The best of Brandon Sanderson so far! I LOVE this book. I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out.  Don't pass this one up.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I love the CD's. They're in really good shape. They play really good, I'm glad i bought from this seller, the book is also in a great shape. as a Bon Jovi fan this is a great acquisition to my collection.
B0042XA2U4|3.0|and I once meant to stop after 1/5 of the book, but I'm glad I continued.<br /><br />I have never seen the film, so I had now idea what to expect of the book, and finally I found it good, and with a surprising ending! I didn't see that coming...
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app constantly force closes. Can not easily navigate between pages without it closing. With as many updates that are done on this app this should not be a problem! Fix it please
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Django unchained is funny, violent, and dramatic. It is engaging from start to finish, and weaves a truly immersive tale. It builds and defines its characters well, all of whom are convincingly portrayed. I opted to purchase the movie instead of just renting it because I had heard such great things, and don't regret my decision, as I will definitely watch this movie repeatedly. If you dot have a stomach for violence, you might want to pass on it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Not much to say here, it's a real memory card. No corruption issues or anything. It works perfectly fine on my PS2
B000002UDG|5.0|I consider that it is a product of high quality, in their content, in their care and in the speed of the shipment, I recommend it if this available one.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|My roommate has a collection with a bunch of special features, and I thought this was it. But this is pretty much just the episodes. Commentary on only a few episodes.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I would recommend this for every person, as the tips makes you learn how to behave in the first time when you meet a person ! Great help to whom who always feel shy to approach anybody at the first place.
B002LII6KA|5.0|I got this off an amazing deal for like $10, and I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a great collection!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Could not put it down! I wish Stephen King would write more like this book! I don't do Horror books and this is not that! This is a real page turner.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. Very relaxing after a long day at work, love the fish and the scenery! My daughter loves looking at the fish swim around also. The music is very relaxing. I fell asleep one day listening to the music while playing the game.<br /><br />Great job guys!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|vulgar, bad acting,waste of time ,made me filll nasty just watching , wish I could get my money back ,read the good book.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|The reset bug still exists!!! Lost a 50% gold purchase upgrade and all progress!! had Meg. Second time I've lost all progress - and the last time. I'm done unless this can be restored. Not starting over again so this can happen - again!!!
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Some of this album sounds a bit like old depeche mode recycled, but dave gahan sings with his usual gutural passion, like he's giving it his all, and even sings falsetto at one point.<br />  This album is extremely catchy, not innovative, but not stale either.  It's very well mixed and produced and it makes you want to blast it loud and proud on your best car stereo, it's a definite keeper, not too long, not too dreary (1 martin gore sung song is dreary) it doesnt overstay its welcome.<br />  this album is a very satisfactory success story.
0786958731|5.0|I have found that the miniatures in this set can be easily primed and painted.<br /><br />Considering how expensive miniatures have gotten in past years getting them for less than a buck per miniature was a pretty good deal.  Some of the miniatures had much better detail than others but overall I was impressed.<br /><br />The game itself is a decent board game.<br /><br />The box is excellent sturdy material and keeps everything packed away neatly.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Great cast, good acting.. but not a film deserving of any special awards.. If you're bored on a weeknight and there's nothing else on, I'd definitely recommend this as a time filler.. It was interesting, but I was left feeling unaffected after the end.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Terrific for anybody who loves words, where they come from, how to say them, how to spell them, what they mean and how to play with them. Great app!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Sat down to watch one episode and ended up having a series marathon. Couldn't stop watching it! So good. This is my new favorite show!
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|For those of us who have been looking for this classic soundtrack on vinyl, this is a welcome product release.<br />The quality of the \\"Virgin\\" vinyl pressing is nice, and has a clean playback quality. It is not noisy or filled with ticks and pops.<br />From a Mastering perspective, it could have used a little more attention on the low end spectrum, but over all it has transparency and clarity.<br /><br />The Packaging is well done, with full color gatefold sleeve. Even the inner sleeves are poly lined, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />Over all, this release was handled well and with a high bar of quality.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Sat down to watch one episode and ended up having a series marathon. Couldn't stop watching it! So good. This is my new favorite show!
B004J4X32U|5.0|This is an excellent book...there are plenty of reviews to endorse that. For me what was exciting is that I'd lie in bed and talk through the graphic narrative sections with my 6 year old. He loved doing it - he'd ask to read the brain book - and it became the perfect way to discuss the concepts in the book. Brilliantly designed with respect to structure and different audiences.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Sat down to watch one episode and ended up having a series marathon. Couldn't stop watching it! So good. This is my new favorite show!
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|I bought this mp3 yesterday.  I absolutely love it!  It is perfect to workout to or for good driving tunes.  I can't believe people are slamming the artist.
0525953728|5.0|Heros one and all. How they got to accompolish  everything with this administration I don't know but God Bless them and protect them, and God Bless Chris Kyle
0062059963|4.0|Not sure what to say! First of all, I am not much of a fan of love triangles. This one was like a tennis match and America being the tennis ball. I felt like she kept going back and forth between Aspen and Maxon. Back and forth and back and forth. The only thing that kept me reading was I desperately wanted to know who she would pick at the end. You never get a grasp of who she is going to pick. And she is constantly getting angry at Maxon spending time with other girls while she is sneaking off to be with Aspen. She felt twofaced to me a bit and I started not like the main character, America, and actually started rooting for another of the Elite to win Maxon's heart.<br /><br />I did like some of the plot points and didn't see a couple thing come. I enjoy being surprised in a book and this one did that. I never knew what direction this book was heading. Just when I thought it would go one way something else would happen. But the same storyline is getting dragged out into the third book and I have a feeling it is going to be yet another tennis match but hopefully this one will end it and answer the question of who she chooses!<br /><br />The world building his the book does seem a bit flimsy to me but maybe because it isn't all fleshed out yet with one more book on the way. There is one point where America has to do a presentation and there is a big following up to it and then it didn't feel as big as the author was trying to make it out to be. And the angry and emotion didn't seemed to go another with exactly what happened.<br /><br />Overall I will probably read the next book because I do ultimately want to know who ends up with who. But if it more of the back and forth love triangle thing the whole entire book I might have to skip the inbetween.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"The sky is always beautiful. Even when it's dark or rainy or cloudy, it's still beautiful to look at. It's my favorite thing because I know if I ever get lost or lonely or scared, I just have to look up and it'll be there no matter what...and I know it'll always be beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Wow, \\"Hopeless\\" grabbed me yesterday and didn't let me go!<br /><br />Hopeless was a beautiful and heartbreaking read. This is how I like my New Adult books to be done; full of angst, full of passion, and with surprises that keep me guessing. I was shocked at how emotionally invested I became in the characters.<br /><br />I had very high expectations for this book. When I first began reading, to be honest, I was wondering if I was going to like this story at all. The writing in the beginning is just kind of...so-so. And when Sky starts on her afternoon run and ends up at Dean's house, I was thinking that this book was going to be a little too much like The Sea of Tranquility. However, soon I was sucked into the world of this book and amazed at what Colleen Hoover brought to the table. This story was powerful and unique and very very special.<br /><br />If I'm being truthful with myself, if I knew the details of this book prior to reading it, I don't know if I would have picked this one up. It involves two topics that I HATE reading about. However, I'm so glad that got to experience this book. It will stay with me for a long time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is so good and well written.  I watched all 3 seasons in 4 days, even my kids enjoyed some episodes. Can't wait for the next season!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|WOW!! I was addicted to \\"Slammed\\" today!!<br /><br />Ms. Hoover really seems to know what I like in my YA books!! It seems like with each of her stories, I'm not impressed for the first 15%. It takes that little umph, that little plot twist to crank up the enjoyment factor from like to love. And Colleen Hoover cranked this one waaaayyyyy up!<br /><br />I am so happy that I didn't read any spoilers prior to starting this book. Each surprise just gutted me and I was with Lake and Will each step of the way. I didn't even know that it was about slam poetry (which I always thought was pretentious and lame but now think is kind of cool).<br /><br />This book is just full and angst and perfectly quotable lines. Colleen Hoover really has a way with words. I love the advice that Lake's mom gives her on men. So spot on.<br /><br />My only gripe is why is there a sequel??. It all comes together in the end and there is even a nice epilogue. What else needs to be said? I guess I'll find out when I start the next in the series!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I do not have much to say other then this is a must buy  every aspect of the game from story to combat to dialogue is amazing get it you wont regret it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved Colleen's other books and this book did not disappoint!!!  I loved the twist although I thought the ending could have finished out a little more.  Highly recommend!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I loved this movie and I really loved the book. This movie, in no small way, captured the book well.
B009GX6600|5.0|Tony and Ziva are getting closer than ever, and there has been excellent story lines in every episode so far!  I can't wait for Season 11!
B001NKI60W|5.0|It is one of those movies that makes you happy and want to get up and dance whenever you watch it.  I bought this new one for my grandchildren to watch.
0545265355|5.0|Great books and a great seller.  Enjoyed reading this series and will definitely re-read it in the future.  Overall, a great buying experience!
B003SJ6W4I|5.0|My wife is a glutton for any animal movie and I usually tolerate them, but this movie was absolutely hysterical. We laughed out loud so many times, my gut hurt.  Great job!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is my favorite TV series.  I like watching on Prime because there are no commercials.  I would recommend to all my friends.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|I'm really enjoying this game...great graphics and cool plot. Using the hint button quite a bit and that is why 4 stars. Still, the hints are usable in a reasonable amount of time. HO aspect is great...not terribly difficult but still a good challenge. Highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I'm having some trouble with the android on my phone - not all the time, but it is frequent enough that the note does not save
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. Great suspense and unfolding of a mystery. You know a story is good when you purposely drag out the last hundred pages to keep it from ending. My favorite of the 3 Morton books I've read so far.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Pay no attention to other reviews,this book is a must read for all ages!What are you waiting for?Why are you still reading this review?Download it,now!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much. I was just wondering if anyone could tell me how to switch to survival mode?
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I loved this series and looking forward to reading more.  Great story line and kept me from putting it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun for the whole family ! Both my 10 yr. old daughter and I love taking turns playing this game. Fun and challenging :)
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Very very good book! Kinda sad but very good,it makes me beleave even more in the after life. Must read!!
B0053JJLLC|5.0|I think Crichton is the H.G. Wells or the Jules Verne of our times. He makes us dream awaken. He makes us feel as Bradbury describes in a short story as a young boy who puts on new pair of sneakers and feels an adventurer. I love it!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I've read everything of hers and she hasn't let me down yet. I recommend her books unreservedly. Colleen has a well-developed voice and imbues her characters with life and depth.<br /><br />If you're thinking to buy only one of Hoover's books and you need to know which is most deserving, i can't help you, because each book is wonderful in a different way. And why deprive yourself? But if you are looking for well-written and skillfully crafted, this is your author.
B00AFXBH04|4.0|Am enjoying the variety of artists and music -- nice introduction to the French pop scene for an American like me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Epic, fresh, adventurous, courageous. This was the by far best book I have ever read, and it won't be the last time I read it for sure!!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|When Justin Timberlake first released FutureSex/LoveSounds it brought in all kinds of fans that never listened to music before then including myself. And for the people who did, they stopped asking when NSYNC was getting back together and started asking JT what he was going to do next. He really set himself apart from everything else that was going on at the time and was the biggest breath of fresh air in years. Skip ahead seven years to January of 2013 when JT released a video on his YouTube channel titled \\"I'm Ready\\". Before this, no one had the slightest idea that he was making an album. Turns out he had been since the beginning of 2012. In the video, he says \\"someone asked me the other day, so are you just done with music? It means more to me than anybody else in the world\\". He proved just that with his third studio album, The 20/20 Experience, which got its title from JT's best friend saying \\"this is music you can see\\".    I must say, this was the most I had anticipated an album in a very long time, perhaps being my most anticipated ever. I'm really glad it came out of nowhere because as short as the wait was, it killed me.    1. \\"Pusher Love Girl\\" - a slower and more classy JT song than we're used to. However, the ending of the song immediately brings you back to FS/LS with its songs that sound like two in one. Almost every song on the record, save for a couple, are structured this way. I love that this has sort of become his signature.    2. \\"Suit & Tie\\" - when it was first released I didn't really get it. But it quickly grew on me and I understood exactly what the point of the song was. It wasn't a representation of what was to come, it was just JT excited to be making music again for the first time in years. I had no doubt that he saved his best material for last. I was right.    3. \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\" - the album truly feels like it begins here with some unique production from Timbaland and fantastic singing from JT. This song is about a girl that's in abad relationship that he invites onto the dancefloor. Before this album had released I was kind of worried that maybe Timbaland didn't have it in him anymore after the disappointing Shock Value II. Thankfully JT brings out the best in Timbaland and they created magic on this record. The outro on this one is a little drawn out, but not too badly. Now, I thought it couldn't get any better than this. Thankfully I was wrong.    4. \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" - I must say, before I wasn't too excited before hearing the song because of its title. I quickly learned to not judge a song before hearing it first. It's a more erotic song that has silly little metaphors throughout that are just subtle enough to where they're not distracting and like most of the songs on the record, the outro is my favorite part. I just love the overall vibe the song gives off.    5. \\"Tunnel Vision\\" - probably my second favorite on the entire record and features vintage Timbaland production. Towards the end is where it really shines. I've heard many people say it's overproduced but that's just Timbaland's style so I guess you have to be a fan. JT cleverly uses another metaphor on the song, comparing having tunnel vision to be intently focused on one girl. It has a very infectious hook that will get stuck in your head for days.    6. \\"Spaceship Coupe\\" - a very spacious and futuristic record. Not much to say about it but it's very different from what you're used to hearing from him. It's a little slower like \\"Pusher Love Girl\\". Not one of my favorites but I wouldn't skip it.    7. \\"That Girl\\" - the first song on the record that really feels completely different from the rest but not out of place like \\"Damn Girl\\" from FS/LS. He sounded very inspired by soul music on this one, especially on the hook.    8. \\"Let the Groove Get In\\" - easily one of my most listened to songs on the record and is probably my third favorite. The addictive hook makes you want to get up at dance even if you suck at it. I have afeeling with time this song will be huge. The song appropriately ends with one of the best outros on the record. The hook is repeated many times on it which is a complaint but I could listen to it a thousand times and it would never get old.    9. \\"Mirrors\\" - my personal favorite. I consider the song to be a spiritual sequel to \\"What Goes Around.../...Comes Around\\" from FS/LS, my all time favorite JT song. Except this is an uplifting song made for his wife, Jessica Biel. When he made \\"WGA.../...CA\\" he was in a failing relationship with Cameron Diaz. I also love the outro (once again) but unfortunately the radio always cuts it.    10. \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" - this one really caught me by surprise. It's a very hypnotic and laid back record that takes a few listens to really sink in. It's very well written and contains a lot of symbolism. So much that you'd have to explain every individual line to really give a full analysis on it. This is a much better closer than \\"(Another Song) All Over Again\\" from FS/LS.    Overall, this album is a lot more coherent than FS/LS. But is it better? FS/LS's high points are much better than 20/20's. I consider \\"What Goes Around.../...Comes Around\\" to be one of the greatest musical achievements by any artist. However, it's low points are much better than FS/LS's, due to it having almost none. FS/LS did have a couple songs that just didn't fit to me. But I still think FS/LS is marginally better. 20/20 was definitely worth the seven year wait though and it was much better than I expected it to be. Some may say he played it safe but I think he played it just safe enough. It works as a worthy follow-up to FS/LS and he still took some risks by making nearly all of the songs around eight minutes long. JT said in the \\"I'm Ready\\" video, \\"I don't wanna put anything out that I feel like is something I don't love. You just don't get that every day\\". He was right.ly better. 20/20 was definitely worth the seven year wait though and it was much better than I expected it to be.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Six stars this was just an amazing book. Even tho the book was ended perfectly, I really hope it's a part two coming soon.

B009K86D86|5.0|This video reveals what most of the older generation knows.  Our food is tainted, artificially modified and something less than wholesome.  Fresh produce is anything but fresh and certainly has lost the taste that those over 55 knew as children & Teens.  This film makes it easy to understand why the US has a weight problem and a health problem.  It is frightening to know that a few companies control most of what we eat and probably are another of the fat cat organizations buying  politicians so they can slowly poison the population in favor of big profits.  Even more frightening, is the fact that citizens do not have the time or incentive to make sure that these companies are monitored.
0007107927|5.0|I thought this book would be fluffy and not worth reading.  One of my clients wanted to use it as part of a workshop I was facilitating, so I went ahead and bought it.  It is spot on!  The book gives you specific steps to become a better manager. I also bought his book on Leadership.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Hands down this has to be the best Batman movie ever made and I've seen them all even the incredibly bad and campy Batman & Robin. Chris Nolan really nailed it on the head by getting the Batman right with this film and its the best one of the trilogy. The ensemble cast is amazing, Christian Bale delivers as Bruce Wayne/Batman (despite the whole thing with his Bat voice.) Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman shine in their repeat performances as Jim Gordon, Alfred & Lucius Fox. Aaron Eckhart did a great job as Harvey Dent and his insane coin flipping persona, Two-Face. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal was an improved upgrade compared to Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. However this movie was carried by one person and one person alone: the late great Heath Ledger as the Joker. His scenes from the pencil trick to the very end with his climatic battle with Batman will be what I remember the most from the movie. It's such a shame that he died at such a young age when he could given the world of cinema so much for the next several years.
B003QSMCKO|1.0|I turned this movie off after Eddie Murphy, playing Mushu, a Chinese ancestral spirit, began to impersonate an African American Christian preacher. Organ music was playing in the background and he began to preach a Chinese ancestral-religion version of an &#34;altar call.&#34;  I feel that this movie is racist and minimizes Christianity, African Americans, and Chinese people.  It is full of stereotypes and promotes the same constant Disney values of &#34;parents are stupid, don't obey them,&#34;  &#34;violence is the best solution after talking fails&#34; and &#34;all religions are the same.&#34;

0425264351|4.0|...And I mean that in a good way.  The Jack Reacher novels are brisk, entertaining novels.  Like many others, I started the series when I heard the movie was coming out.  And my only complaint is that I'm out of Jack Reacher novels to read.  Where Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler and others faded, at least for me,  Lee Child's momentum is strong, and I enjoyed them all.<br /><br />At best, they are gripping, captivating and rocking.  The worst that I can say is that sometimes they are a bit formulaic in the last acts.  But, I'll keep buying: I wish I could say that about some of the other authors of Thriller/Adventure series.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|AWESOME!!!  I couldn't put the book down .  And with the narration it was like I was there. I would recommend  this book!

B0065RIJ3W|4.0|In general I thought this was a good book.  It covered all the basics to get you started in Aquaponics.  I wish that the author had gone into more detail about the CHOP 2 System.  But, links were given that provided information on this topic.  There is a lot of information out there about aquaponics and sometimes it's hard to sort through all the noise to find what you really need to get started.  This book provides is a good place to start to take you away from all that.

B00BDSRISA|1.0|You  know....call me old....call me closed minded.....your privaledge....you're wrong. I just happen to appreciate GOOD music..NOT the case here.<br /><br />I caught these guys on Lettermans show......What the hell has happened to music in the millenium????  Music is supposed to get better thru the years.  NOT in this case.  The musicianship was beginner level at very best.  AND as for the creativity and writing ability......IF this is what is considered acceptable to todays youth, tomorrows musical future is in serious trouble.<br /><br />I always prided myself on exceptional musical  taste....but I cant honestly recommend this to anyone.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Why would anyone NEED to buy one more Miserables DVD when they've already seen first-rate versions of the stage musical multiple times and already own the 1995 \\"Dream Cast\\" concert version DVD (the one that winds up with all the world's best Jean Valjeans sharing the stage at the end), and also the powerful 1998 Bille August/Liam Neeson not-a-musical version?<br /><br />Two reasons:<br /> 1. Because the brilliantly researched and recreated 19th century Paris sets and character closeups \\"bring it home\\" in ways that none of the above can do anywhere near as well,  and...<br /><br />2. Because rental copies contain ONLY the movie on them and NONE of the extras. The only way to see the key actors talking about their roles and the set designers showing us how they recreated 19th century Paris and the director's commentary...is to buy the DVD.
1434440826|5.0|Some people are very mislead by the way the information is presented. You pray to your own subconscious mind to gain control of yourself and your life, not God. Some of the atheists reviewing 1 star are so closed minded that they completely dismiss the book as soon as they see the words pray or god. There are religious writings, and that is because for 1000's of years people have taken control of the true potential in their subconscious minds praying to \\"God\\". Your subconscious is the \\"God\\" of which every individual prays to, even if they don't realize it. God does not hear and answer your prayers, but your all seeing/knowing subconscious mind does. God is a metaphor for a driving force which has always been accessible to you.
B003QSLW0K|3.0|Full disclosure: my husband and I watched Disney/Pixar and DreamWorks movies long before we had kids and we want to share our love of animated films with our daughter. She is almost 4 and we watch movies together on Friday evenings. I recommended Lilo and Stitch last week. For the first time ever my daughter was scared of a movie (and she watched Brave with no problems). The movie started out on a violent note with Lilo slapping another girl silly and continued with Lilo and Stitch being chased and fired upon by laser guns. But I think constant threat of Lilo being taken away is what really bothered my daughter. I honestly didn't remember it being so fraught.  It's a sweet story but for a more mature adolescent audience.

0767817729|5.0|This is one of those movies, that REALLY makes you understand about Revenge. How at some time or another, we have all thought about it, but usually don't act on it. All The Actors do a Great job, some you would like to reach thru the screen to help, others you would like to give that extra push. You won't be bored.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book makes others dull in comparison. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for 3 books to read, you can't stop with the first one.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|The book is essentially an extended description of the last battle, so has a different tone in both focus and finish. That said it appropriately paints the magnitude of the conflict, the multitude of the fronts, and wraps up the hanging points of the story across the board. Well done and a quick 900 page read if there ever was one.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|it works for my iphone. quality is questionable. had it for some time now and it hasnt broke. i hope this helps
031606792X|5.0|I have read it a few times now. I will save it to read again one day. I have the whole series.
B009DZDJU6|4.0|Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter takes historical events and characters and infuses them with fantasy to reflect what we already know or think we know about the Civil War and President Lincoln. It builds upon the image of Lincoln as the Great Emancipator, further cements Gettysburg as the pivotal battle of the Civil War in our collective memory, perpetuates some of the South's Lost Cause ideology, and replaces the real, material horrors of slavery that made Lincoln into the anti-slavery politician that he was with supernatural horrors that lead him to fight with words, and a very, VERY spiffy axe.<br /><br />The fight scenes get a tiny bit dry after a while, but the vampires are appropriately frightening and predatory. No sparkling mopers or flippant hedonists here. Do not expect wonders from the plot, but it's not terrible either. Give it a chance, and you might just enjoy it! Just approach with the right mindset, and you won't have any expectations dashed, I hope.

B00985E3UG|4.0|This book provides copious evidence of how the food giants disregarded overwhelming evidence of the effects of sugar,fat, and salt on people's health, causing widespread obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. They used their own research to determine the amounts of these ingredients to add to get people addicted to their foods. Of course, they defend the rights of their customers to consume whatever they want, knowing that most folks do not do the research to know what foods to avoid and just eat whatever tastes good.<br />Hopefully, the reader will become more aware of what he or she is eating, and will choose healthy foods rather than the junk that the food giants are offering.

1439153663|5.0|I was engaged in this book from the beginning. I love the historical significance Kathleen Grissom brings to the reader. She spins a tale that is based on tons of research that makes you believe this is the way it was growing up on a plantation in the South a couple of centuries ago. It is complete with slavery, &#34;the Big House&#34;, the cruelty, the abuse, and the spirit of the soul to right the wrongs you find yourself in. There are many and they are varied. The &#34;correct&#34; speech of the Kitchen House folks and the Big House folks is pitch perfect. I don't know when I've enjoyed a book more. I can't wait for her next book which I hope is a continuation of The Kitchen House. I am a fan forever.

B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|was to take the tiny reversed pictures inside raindrops on petals and leaves.  Voila!  Adding this to my Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lense makes it possible, if I hold very still.  This combo has made some amazing photos possible.  I must caution that the depth of field is VERY narrow, so any kind of movement can shift it out of focus.  If you are a tripod fancier, it would be advisable to use one.  I like the flexibility of just body motion, but it does mean sometimes bracketing to be sure you capture what you hope you have. The snap-on capability means it can be attached to telephoto (or perhaps any other lens) as well, but then a tripod is a must.  I love this lens.

B009NCM248|5.0|What can I say, this CD rocks. I am a huge fan or stone sour and slipknot. Corey Taylor has done an amazing job of writing and composing on this CD. If you are a hard rock/metal fan you will like this. If your not, you will still like this CD.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|But unfortunately this is not the one you want. It comes apart easily, and it's a cheap design. For this amount of money, I expected better.
B005QVCXM6|5.0|1st I love her voice. I think in rock, she has the best voice out there. I'm glad she finally has another CD. Heard her single on the radio and had to go buy this CD. Listen to a few tracks off it so far and I'm not disappointed by any means.
0345525558|5.0|This book was a very enlightening eye-opener for anyone who is or ever will be a foster parent. She really shows the emotional issues that plague foster children. I laughed, cried tears of sorrow then tears of joy. I hope this will not be the last book for the author. It is hard to believe this was her first book. It really makes me want to write a book about my life which was worse than hers. Awesome book!
B00BZOD63S|5.0|So far this is an awesome movie. Not gory but scary as hell. From the guy who did hell boy 2 and pans labrynth. Very scary and would recommend it to all horror fans
092389165X|4.0|This was on my daughter's required summer reading list. She didn't like it (she's 16) so I ended up taking it and reading it. It's very interesting - a good read.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|Once again no kids and me and my wife love this movie. The animation and story is top notch. If you have never seen this movie its heart warming and its a must see movie. Great for the entire family. Don't miss out. Buy it.
1451695195|5.0|This has everything going for it.  It has research, development which makes it more and more reasonable, and a bit of mystery as well.  May seem at times that it gets a bit technical but it lends more believabilty to the message.  I have purchased a number of this book and sent to friends.  I see it as a source of hope and inspiration as well as just a joyful experience.
B003HI3MSE|5.0|What can I say, this CD rocks. The band  has done an amazing job of writing and composing on this CD. If you are a hard rock/metal fan you will like this. If your not, you will still like this CD
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|it veered a little but they usually do. And they also usually suck (the movies) but this one didn't. Cooper nailed it and Jennifer Lawrence is awesome. worth watching... what ? you haven't seen it yet?? WTF are you waiting for!!!!!
B00B19F3PG|5.0|If you a fan of horror movies, you need to watch this movie. If you liked any kind of possession movies, then you need to watch this. Definitely not something you want to watch with the kids. Go watch it
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is a must read especially if you liked the TV series. Loved all the characters. It is a great story.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Sound garden is back together after years. I just bought this CD after hearing their single on the radio &#34;I have been away too long&#34;. Huge Chris Cornell fan. I have always loved his vocals and song writing
B000SZK41M|5.0|Willis is amazing in every single die hard movie, I think that this one is my favorite. Check it out.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|So my wife and I have no kids, and we bought this. Its a great movie based in the video game world. Disney went above and beyond with this movie, the animation and the story is amazing. Even if you don't have kids, go buy it.

B005S39YGU|5.0|I 1st got turned on to this show by my wife. I'm glad in did. This show is pure genius. Once you start watching it, you will be sucked in. This show is very well done and since you are hooked, you will need more. If you are a fan of comedy go get some.
B00005MP58|5.0|The best at following the book. I disliked the main female actress she had a too fat of a face and that time period women were not allowed to look at the man.<br /> Themother was aweful.Skreachy voice. And to young<br /> I'd recommend this to all my friends. I wish they had a directors following at the end. It's always fun to see what they cut and why.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|1st let me say Daniel Craig is actually my favorite bond. This movie blows away in my opinion all the other bond movies. I won't spoil it for you but after you watch it, its a game changer.its sets up for the next bond movie.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|I would love to play past chapter 2. Unfortunately every time I open the app it closes and I cannot finish the level I am currently on due to this problem. I tried many times to re-download and play but that doesn't seem to do the trick. Other then that so far the game is great fun.
B005XI94HY|5.0|This is one of my wife and sisters favorite shows. Its about girl who's father was wrongly prosecuted and put to death for chrimes he didn't commit.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|impeccable acting, and pretty amazing that this &#34;story&#34; actually happened. Yes, I realize not exactly as depicted, but still. Dang.
B0060CV31C|5.0|This is one of Disney newer per say movies but in my mind its a classic. Love all the characters and even for an adult, this movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing. Actors such as David spade and john Goodman make this movie  a pleasure to watch. Kids will love it go get it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|interesting show with due credit to the bright and talented women attorneys who live this life. kudos to producers for a well researched production with superb actors and actresses. great clothing and the down and dirty of big firms in big cities.
B00BP4W3WI|5.0|1st, this movie is a classic. If you or your kids have never seen this movie, change that now. Its made in the 80's and is a story of a family and one of the kids finds an alien. I will not spoil the rest for you but this is a great movie for the entire family to watch
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Found this book hard to put down.  Easily drawn into the characters, setting, and time..  I am looking forward to reading more by this author.
B008GVSWVO|5.0|This is actually based on a true story of a girl who is possessed while she is away at collage. Its a sad story. A priest attempts to remove the dream on and fails and is put on trail for what he did and her death. This movie will chill you to the bones.
B000089RVX|5.0|This has all the sounds of such beautiful music with the extra hard rock and exquisite lyrics to make it well rounded in so many ways.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|This is my wife and also sisters favorite show. If you need a good girl show to watch, from what I am told this is it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is so much harder than the first ones that we got, I bought it for the kids and ended up playing the darn thing for 3 hours myself determined to conquer it and no such luck, lots of fun and the kids sit still and concentrate, great for a time out tool if needed.  friends of mine bought it for their son to use when he has issues with anger, he has to sit and do this for 10 min. it works great.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This CD rocks and so does the lead singer. Just saw the,m live at house of blues with bullet for my valentine. This is the 1st CD of hers I have owned but it rocks. If you like hard Rock with great vocals then you have found it. She is also a great song writer.
1484156005|5.0|Sebastian takes the reader through a wide variety of characters that grow, learn and evolve as the story unfolds.  The historical background is masterfully woven to set the reader in the time frame.<br />The story has very entertaining metaphysical aspects, historical flow and a wide range of the universal feeling of love.<br />Mr. Fischer secures a place with this second book as a great story teller who knows how to tug at our heartstrings while taking us in a journey before during and after WWI.<br />On a personal note I absolutely loved the way he tied everything up in the uplifting ending.
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|One of my favorite Pixar films.<br />I would highly recommend it.very funny and we do not have any kids yet.:-)
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I gave this a five star because I love the way the story is written and how captivating it is. The ending will make your jaw drop and you will buy the next book instantly to continue reading. I love how the chapters were labeled as then or now. You got to see Lena's past and present which was a different way of writing and I loved it. Lena is one of my favorite characters in a book series that I have read and I enjoyed reading her story. If you loved the Divergent books, this is the next series for you to read. If you are into love and love triangles, buy this book now. It is beautifully written and so captivating. I highly recommend this book.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Shine Down rocks. If you like hard rock, then this cd is for you. Great mix or heavy songs then slower songs. I have been a big fan of this band for years. I would highly recommend this CD to any rock fans.
0399226907|5.0|I purchased this product for my grandbaby. He immediately was drawn to all of the different things that can be done with this toy. It is brightly colored and had different feels to different parts. I purchased this with 3 other toys, and he seemed to be drawn to this the most. It's a little big to take out to dinner, but it's super cute to have at home.
B00C4QMH9U|5.0|This is one of my wife and sisters favorite shows. Its about girl who's father was wrongly prosecuted and put to death for chrimes he didn't commit.
0763644765|5.0|I love the book and this is no exception! It smells great and leaves my baby so happy ,i love it
B0018GRAE4|5.0|I have recently discovered five finger death punch. They are a great band and rock hard.little heavier than there newer able but I love it. If you like five finger death punch make sure this is in your collection
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was very good and it kept me on the edge of my seat  and I was happy with the end too
B008YI91HS|5.0|I can't tell you how many times I have see this classic movie. When I was a kid and now. Its still great to watch. For how old it is, the special effects are still amazing even for now. This movie was truly ahead if its time. If for some unknown reason you have not seen this show. You need to go buy it ASAP.
B001TODO54|5.0|Oh God, I never thought I was going to L O V E this book. I've heard a lot of good stuff about this book, and I totally recommend it.<br />Read it, you won't regret it. Katsa is a very strong character, and I love how Po understands her.<br /><br />PS: I AM EXCITED FOR THE MOVIE!!
B007LB2B3K|5.0|What can I say, this CD rocks. Heard volbeat on Xm first then saw them live.volbeat has done an amazing job of writing and composing on this CD. If you are a hard rock/metal fan you will like this. If your not, you will still like this CD. They have a very unique sound
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome I've almost got all the chsrachters and this game should also send out more updates with hover boards and stuff
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I have heard the single on the radio and wife loved it so bought the CD.1st cd in years and these guys still have it . I would recommend it. Won't be disappointed
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|You've read the reviews. They all say the same thing - great songs, great harmony, great sound. It's all true. This could be the best CD I own, and I have lots and lots of CDs. Listening, the next track begins and you say, &#34;Oh, I really like THIS one.&#34; That happens over and over with this CD. Love these guys and can't wait to see them in concert sometime. If you're debating whether to buy or download it, go for it. It is pure entertainment.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Deffenitly rated r so not a show to watch with your kids. Lots of sex jokes and funny as hell. Watched it with my wife and really enjoyed it. If you like raunchy funny comedy do it
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Lots of new insight into Chaplin's life I never knew about before.  Well worth seeing whether you are a silent film fan or not.
B00BPQF4JA|5.0|My wife and sister love this show. Apparently its quite popular. I am more a fan of action, a venture and sience fiction myself so have never watched it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It was a fun book, very enjoyable. I enjoyed this one the most out of the three books in the trilogy.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Great show. If you like drama series, then this is a must see show. From season 1-6 there hasn't been a bad episode. Do not hesitate go get this show right meow.
0765325950|5.0|You could say in one way the dream has ended.....the series is completed....or is it.<br /><br />I must say I was very sad to see the end of the book.  So many of the friends I had come to know and love faltered in this book.<br /><br />I cant help but wonder what the differences may have been if Mr. Jordan had completed this masterpiece.  As  it is I think Mr Sanderson did a very good job and breathed fresh life into the last few book of the story.<br /><br />I really would like to possibly see a short book set 20 to 25 years in the future showing what happening to everyone who survived.  I think it would make an interesting read
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Myles Kennedy and slash collaborated and made this awesome CD. The CD rocks and the vocals are amazing. If you are a fan of rock, and you like slash you need to buy this CD now
B0098XZHSU|3.0|it does not have the stations that i would listen to. Limited access. Not that easy to move around in.
B0060D15AK|5.0|I normally don't like chick flick but this one is pretty funny. Ryan Reynolds does an amazing job and Sandra Bullock is still hot. She is from Canada and has been dogging her ins meetings son is getting deported. Bribes/ black males her coworker since h<br />She is his boss into marrying her so she can stay.
B004SDEP38|3.0|i played with it for a while and it is ok if you want to do minor things. Try it and make your own decision.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it!!! It's a must read. Couldn't put it down. You will not be  disappointed. I look foward to part two.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|True to Bosch form, another mystery solved with lose ends tied up nicely.  For Bosch fans, this is a good read.
B007SGM084|5.0|So glad I took the time to read these books! I loved each and every book, page and character:) Cannot wait for more!
B0073COMKW|5.0|I was worried that it would not have the same warm &#34;color&#34; as my older CFLs, but these really appear identical in brightness and color. I think the only concern is that if you are relying on back reflection into your lamp shade or light diffuser it may not look the same since this light mainly goes from the top hemisphere only, as opposed to the all-around glow of CFLs or incandescents.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I have started watching The Tudors, and like the series so far. I don't believe it's historically accurate, but history doesn't always address the details. It's well acted and the actors are (mostly) believable.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its a fun game and I recommend it to all who likes to have fun.  Its nothing I dislike about this game
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Although many of the plots were predictable, I really liked this whole series. Colin Morgan as the young Merlin was likable and funny. Bradley James as a young, spoiled prince fit the role wonderfully. If you know the Merlin legend, you know what Morgana and Mordred are going to do, and there's really no suspense about the ending, but it was very well conceived and executed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it because it really makes you think.  Their is nothing that I dislike about this game.  I gave it five starts because I love it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Interesting and exciting. A definite can't put down book for anyone who loves history, running or evolutionary anthropology. I would defintiely recommend it.
0061978078|5.0|Great second installment! Lauren Oliver is a very creative writer. I mean, I have a very active imagination but I would have never dreamt of this. Who'd have thought that Lovelessness would be in a Dystopian world. Amazing book!
0812982622|5.0|This book won pulitzer prize recently and I've begun reading it.  Great writing and can't wait to share with my Book Club as our June pick!
B00CFITJKW|1.0|I have seen free games that are 10 times better than this piece of crap.  Don't waste your money, maybe in 10 yrs this app will become something.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Tom is not talking.  Kindle requests to download again - still not working. Tired of using battery to download games that won't work.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Easily the best new  Epic fantasy I have read this decade, world building, deep meaningful characters and a great adventure.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Not politically correct , Get over it..It shows how far we have come .Funny Satire .Sometimes it was Outrageous ..  I Laughed
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great book, could not put it down.  Just as good then the pillars of the earth.highly recommend to all readers
B0064MGU98|5.0|Haven't ad time to watch many of the shows, but love the first one !  Very entertaining and the star as a lot of backbone and smarts in the story!
B008133MDK|5.0|Very well written, great acting and very enjoyable.  In this era of &#34;junk&#34; shows on the networks (Showtime and HBO included)  it is great to have the option of selecting high quality viewing when you want it.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Not a bad song on this disk. You don't have to be a genius when you listen to know that Cohen is preparing to exit the world. At once serious, ironic, and self-mocking, he has created a new body of work, sung in an old man's voice, with an old man's wisdom. Don't go yet, Leonard! We want more!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Baldacci does another excellent job of story telling.  As always, couldn't put it down until I finished the whole book.
1936608898|5.0|I am on day 26 and I see everything differently.  I have pcos and I was recently also diagnosed with hypothyroid - both conditions work together to drain energy, create an overall terrible feeling, increase weight gain, and much more.  It is apparent that the foods I was eating were fueling the conditions but now I feel like I am in control.  I sleep better, enjoy and look forward to healthier foods, and generally feel happier.  I feel like the future is going to be much different and much healthier.  Thank you!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Flynn's books, and this last one was just another great story that kept me at it till finished.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Being a huge of the Tudors I was looking for something to replace it...The Borgias did not dissapoint. After Season 1 I was hooked and was looking for more. As gripping and scintillating as the first season was the second season is even better because everything they did in the first season is amped to 10 in the second season. This is a must see for period drama junkies!! Edge of your seat-pulse pounding TV-this will not disappoint!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great background story of both pilots, then the WWII incident, and finally a meeting many years later.  What a great story, that is extremely well written.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|Selected my first PDF, which had about 60 pages in it. I thought it was loading, because the pages were turning, but no audio. Loaded one of those voices from IVONA, that didn't help. Tried 3 different PDF's but none played audio. Played some vids to make sure it wasn't a speaker problem, and its not. Not sure what the deal is. -HP Touchpad
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Superb writing, acting, cinematography and music.  The non-expected twists keep you interested in the investment you've made in the characters and story line.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|nemo's reef is boss!it is the best.I love nemo.this nemo game is awesome.nemo is my favorite movie.this app is just like the movie:amazingly spectacular.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this book written through the voice (mind) of a man with obsessive compulsive disorder and manic depression.  The author did a good job of consistently protraying the events in the book as might be seen by a man with these mental issues to deal with.
B002VT6C0K|5.0|I really enjoyed each of the wonderful short stories & such great variety of characters & locales.  Want to read more of her books.  Rosemary Howes
B006IYFCIM|4.0|I was introduced to Dan Ariely on TED talks, and find his social experiments fascinating.  I have also read predictably irrational.  This as my second foray into the writing of Ariely was  vary informative, interesting and educational.  He does refrence several of the same social experiments he conducted for his studies in irrationality, but does rethink the data, and also moves forward with new modifications.  Good reading to all.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|As a whole I liked the movie more. I think it's hard to really sympathize with people who spontaneously burst out crying too often and I'm glad the movie did without most of it. That said, I still finished this book in one day. It was well worth it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready player one is heavy in 80s era pop culture.  If you grew up during this time with a love of Sci-Fi / technology themes you will enjoy this book.  Especially if you've played MMORPGs of the current day and age.<br /><br />Set in a open licensed virtual reality game, the story is able to mash elements from different universes together almost in a way that  reminds me of terribly written fan fiction.  The narrative pulls it off successfully, however.<br /><br />Without spoiling very much, inclusions of separate media include a Delorean with K.I.T.T. artificial intelligence, and sweet ghostbusters decals.  A chain of quests involving reenactments of every episode of the original Ultraman series.  People in the game with sweet collections of space crafts including Serenity (Firefly), an X-Wing (StarWars).<br /><br />The game also touches on several themes of current MMORPGs: open world and arena pvp, questing, leveling, special events, rare items and spells, travel, economy.<br /><br />All in all, a great read for geeks.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I found this book super engaging. The author has a true talent in bringing in your being into her shoes.
1616550414|5.0|This book is enjoyable if you are a Zelda fan. The level of detail that went in to translating this from Japanese to English is remarkable. It covers every Zelda game (made by Nintendo) in great detail. It does spend about half of the book talking about Skyward Sword, but there is no lack of information on any of the games. If you are a Zelda fan, I would absolutely recommend this book.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is as awesome as a movie can get. Great piece of film making. Quentin Tarantino at his best!! Loved every minute of it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed reading these three books. Very interesting. It was a delightful story from a different perspective. Completely entertaining. Thanks
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|thrilled to hear some New Burdon. Loved it!! He's still eveything Paul McCartney wanted to be, but could'nt pull off!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was expecting to be disappointed, how could such a seemingly high quality and precision mouse be do inexpensive. I wad wrong, this mouse is awesome. Solid, great looks, amazing features, great software. I ordered to replace my Corsair Mouse that was twice the price and less performance.... So, what are you waiting for... Get to ordering your new Anker High Precision Laser Gaming Mouse NOW!!!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Season 6 was everything I expected and some. I can't wait to purchase season 7. Dexter has been a great series, I would recommend it to all of my friends and family.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was one of the best books I've read in a long time . . . until I got to the end. I couldn't put the book down, it was so good. It was gearing up for this terrific ending but then it seemed like they had run out of room and had to quick put an ending it. The ending ruined the entire book!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have had this App for a while on my kindle fire but every two weeks or so I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get it to stop force closing. That is my only problem with it.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|This is a lighthearted and fun show that I have found to be of a higher caliber than many others on this network. Fun to watch!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is a great game and I enjoy it very much it a good thing to do in your spare time but I don't think that you should have to buy things to continue.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The Innocent is one of his best.  You can't put it down from the moment you pick it up!  But isn't that true with Baldacci's novels? I especially like this one for the partnership with youth.  This tale won't disappoint you. I highly recommend it!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I hope there are more books to come by this amazing author. I want to read more, and try more amazing recipes!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great book, easy to read and well written. The story certainly held my interest and I had a good time trying to figure out whodunit.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|i have been wanting to see this for a long time and it was well worth the wait.  what a story of encouragement , courage and perseverence.  i highly recommend it !!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|The movie was a little too long for me, but it was surprisingly funny. The action was good and the gory parts were almost cartoonish, which meant I could watch it without being grossed out!
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|The chemistry between the actors was a treat to behold. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd fell into their back-and-forth with a natural ease that made their roles as husband and wife easy to believe. The movie casts an unblinking eye on the emotional, physical, and financial trials of marriage and middle age, with sometimes raunchy, sometimes touching moments.<br />That said, I felt that the movie dragged in the middle and needed a stronger ending. Definitely worth a watch though!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book I am going to read it again because I miss Christian already and can't wait to see the movie.
145210655X|5.0|There's nothing really to read, but it's a great novelty book to have around. Cute and funny drawings. I guess you could call it a &#34;coffee table book.&#34;
B002APU580|5.0|Let's start off saying: you should watch the 1995 version with Collin Firth, it is a must for any P&P/Jane Austen fan.  The 1980 version is also decent.  They both give you the longer version of the story, which is definately worth seeing.  All that being said, this is still my favorite P&P - and probably my favorite movie of all time.  It renewed my love of period films, shows, and novels.  I can watch it over & over and still notice little things about it each time.  The attention to detail is wonderful.  It is shorted to 127 minutes, so you wont get the same scenes you got in the mini series, but they had almost 4 & 1/2 hours to go into the story.  But this does not take away from my love of this film.  It is beautifully shot, the scenery is so amazing to look at, the music is wonderful.  And the chemestry between Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen is undeniable.  They build such emotion with just a look.  Funny for me to remember seeing the advertisement and wondering who Matthew Macfadyen was and why they chose him.  After watching the film and falling in love with his version of Darcy, I am now a huge fan.  Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are wonderful as Mr & Mrs Bennet.  Great performances by: Judi Dench, Simon Woods, Rupert Friend, Carey Mulligan and Tom Hollander as well.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford immediately drew me in!  I think the characters are charming and the story lines are thoughtful.  I found myself smiling throughout many episodes and tearing up through others.  Escaping to another time and place while sitting in the comfort of my own home was a lot of fun.

B0018QQQK8|5.0|I read this book in one day because of the great story line developed. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story full of love, excitement, and anticipation.

B0089LOG02|4.0|I was unaware of this particular historical event, so i found this fictional novel very interesting.  The author does a great job of weaving the facts with characters' experiences.  Very interesting...kept me wanting to make the time to read!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It was a present and the one who got it was delighted!!!!!!!!! So I can only recommend it!!!!!!!!! Thank you. Have Kleenex close to you....it becomes heartbreaking
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Everyone has this on everything so I downloaded it for my lil one and it doesnt do much. but when it does, it closes. it may have a bug or something.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game should have way more things to buy. But I like the game very very very very very very very very very very much. Still should have way more to buy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show, I love being able to go back in time and experience the traditions, costumes, and language of the day. Not to mention great storylines!
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|I was sorely disappointed in this. I had heard great reviews but it lacked real depth and interesting plot. Needs more direction.
B004WOS7LO|5.0|Winner of American Idol 7, David Cook doesn't fail to impress us with his wonderful mix of songs. Really a wonderful talent and this album is just him!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love fringe! Joshua Jackson and the rest of the cast never fail in entertaining me. My only complaint is that it ends after season 5.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The only sad thing is that I'll have to wait ten years to see how the whole thing end :-)<br /><br />A part from this. Great writing. The book is long but it doesn't lag. The end bring enough closure to be fully satisfying, yet leaving enough enticing open questions.<br /><br />It's going to be one the greatest fantasy epics.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love the game, but since there are no real prizes for winning, I think it is too expensive and should have more free play.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for people with a passion for horses. Very realistic movement for horse.  Would reccomme d to other horse people, would also be good for kids longing for a horse.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|One of the best Techno Thrillers I have seen lately.  And, they put some humor in as well.  Now, its &#34;Your Mission Should you Choose...&#34;
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very helpful. I got interested in trying it after reading an e-book with some tips on how to organize your data, share information amog your devices and get free from paper. It did help me and I recommend this app!
0062059963|5.0|Sooo Kiera Casss I need book 3 immediately after that ending! The Elite was beyond amazing and Maxon has definitely won me over with his compassion and love for America!! As most of you know I loved The Selection and the same for this one because it was completely and utterly one book that will keep you to read more of! I was definitely hooked to reading what was going to happen after all these rebel attacks on the kingdom. The writing was very well put together and I was not disappointed after reading The Elite.<br /><br />The plot and romance increased A LOT which I was happy about because America did need to connect with Maxon more, at the same time Aspen is trying to redeem himself to her. As one of The Elite, America is definitely under the pressure of trying to make a choice between them at the same time, I saw her in The Elite as much a stronger character who can defend herself and maybe in the end become a princess. Maxon, Maxon, Maxon. I loved you even more in this book and with your kindness and patience you have made a way into may heart.<br /><br />We also saw the progess of how Illea came to be and how it was created with the caste system. It was a very interesting take of events. There was surprises with some of the characters and the story did more show the relationship more of America and Maxon which I also liked. The political turmoil is more of a precaution and it was interesting of why are the rebels attacking the castle or what were they looking for.<br /><br />The Halloween scene is definitely a favorite in the book because its a ball and Maxon wanted to do this for America. The Elite had my emotions everywhere and I wanted to cry at the end of what was happening between America and Maxon, and Aspen who needs to rethink some stuff as well. There were moments of utter chaos and hoping nothing would happen to the characters (maybe Celeste who I want out of the Selection), but as more secrets behind the kingdom started to come out it will be an eye opener for the next book which I sense is going to be utter chaos and more competition, romance and pretty dresses!<br /><br />The Elite is one book you need to read right away because this sequel will make you cry, scream and just cry!! I want the next book right now, if you havent picked up The Selection I must command you to go pick it up and give it a try if you love dystopian with a twist of romance. Fans of Kiera Cass will love this book, as do myself. I look forward to book 3 to see the conclusion of the series as well as finding out who will win America's heart.opener for the next book which I sense is going to be utter chaos and more competition, romance and pretty dresses!<br /><br />The Elite is one book you need to read right away because this sequel will make you cry, scream and just cry!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love these books. Very well written; didn't want to stop reading. kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|I loved this movie!! Roberty Downey Jr. is the best as Ironman! His sense of humor is great and his acting is great! This is a really good sequel to the first Ironman. Can't wait to see Ironman 3 if it is half as good as this one!!
B0058O84G0|4.0|At first this novel appeared to be daunting. The novel however was well written, integrating fiction with fact in an easy manner. At no time did I loose the threads of the various characters and families. A good story, thoroughly enjoyed it. Cannot wait to start the second book.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a touching story of an orphan boy and the horrible life he endured prior to being adopted.  The man he became remembers the abuse he had endured, but also the redeeming love of his adoptive parents.<br /><br />Though this story contains elements of tragedy, it also contains elements of redemption.<br /><br />This story is well written, cleverly constructed.  The characters are real and come to life on the page.  Though seemingly a dark story, it still contains humor as well as the hope that love and affection can instill in a little boy called \\"86\\"'<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story well written. I became quite attached to the characters.<br /><br />An excellent read!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like it. would love it on my laptop! I have 4kindles in the house and its on all of them. try this app. you will like it.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|A wonderful, thoughtful story by our modern master of parables. my wife and I have already read it aloud twice and it will be on my regular read list.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It is a classic book and I would like to read it again. E book edition is really helpful to use.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read, depth of character, and full of surprises. Hard to put down! Author portrays characters very realistically that you feel part of the story.
B004P1JEXE|1.0|I loved AGOT 1 to 3.  This was a tedious book with an incongruous cliffhanger at the end, a waste of time....
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Taleb always tells the truth even when it hurts. The good news is that in this book he gives some advice on how to limit the effect of black swans on your life.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|We read the book and then watched the movie with the kids. It's a great kid movie. They loved it. And us parents enjoyed it too.
1451696191|5.0|Stephen Chbosky is a literary genius who is not afraid of hitting the controversial and heart wrenching topics. While I know many complain about the main character's diction and emotional state, he only acts this way because of underlying issues. Honestly, this is one of the best books I have ever read.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I honestly could not put this book down.  The stories and the hearts of all the characters become so interwoven that it becomes impossible to invest yourself in a &#34;favorite&#34; - they all become so incredibly dear.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A great game for everyone big, small, young, and old alike. When you need more coins just wait and they shall come. It's better then the fair because it costs is great. PLAY AND HAVE FUN!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Very well acted by all the characters.  Maggie Smith is a delight.  Looking forward to season four.  Some scenarios a bit contrived so, four stars instead of five.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|this clock or alarm really helped me get up if ur ganna get a alarm clock app get this ONE
B0052AC8C6|4.0|One of my daughter's favorite movies. Even I enjoying watching this movie with my daughter. Great characters, intelligent plot, wonderful animation.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This an awesome game,one of the very best games free or paid for that I've played from Amazon. Five stars no less!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book but wish I could rewrite the end.  I am not much for tragic endings.  Nice twists.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Easy to level up and its nice not to pay real money to play this game. It's very addicting and controls aren't bad
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love it..reminds me of Dion park tycoon..I waste way to much time and money on this app since I'm impatient.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan and Vikings falls into the same genre (but with fewer storylines). Thoroughly enjoyed the script, the scenery and you have to check out the Viking hair (including a wide array of beard arrangements). Good stuff.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|Great series keeps you guessing what happens next. Reading books before watching the series. Books so much better. Highly recommended.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|I loved this movie, sat through all of it and couldn't believe that I didn't get up once.  Daniel Day-Lewis is Lincoln.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am in love with this book. Such a strong lead character. So well tied together. As a survivor myself, there were elements of this story that were so well written and made me highlight quotes and say \\"how perfectly worded\\". The romance was the best addition to this as it grows naturally. The whole book flows well and makes you think about what it means to love, who really matters and strength. Such a good book!!!
157421327X|1.0|I love to \\"Zentangle,\\" (doodle for the non-copyrighted-world) don't get me wrong, but the \\"philosophy\\" and the \\"method\\" behind this cult-of-buying is pretty weak. You don't need Italian paper do to this, nor a Japanese pen. Their \\"Zentangle-zone\\" is not restricted to those who have read the manual, please don't be fooled. Just have a quick look around the internet, find an artist you like and get going. Then, make a donation to support his/ her work. Don't waste your money on these \\"books\\" which say what has already been said a thousand times (for free).<br />I reckon people buy stuff like this for validation-- to turn their doodling into something real. You don't need to spend 9 bucks to do that. Just believe in the beauty of your own work.

B000FZETIO|2.0|Since Duckie doesn't come out where he's supposed to,and instead Richie Rich does,it isn't Duckie,it's Richie.So instead of the Everything's Duckie Edition,it should be called the Everything's Richie Edition.And about saying thaat the original ending is included...well,let's just say that line isn't going to work on a used car salesman or a lightning rod salesman,but about as much truth.

0307454894|5.0|If I didn't have to earn a living, I would have read this book in one night. My favorite part was the first part. It never occurred to me until later that Hanna couldn't read. I wonder if Hanna at the swimming pool was Michael's imagination? I got a little bored in the second part during the trial. The ending didn't really surprise me. I wonder why Hanna didn't ask Michael to write a letter once in a while. This was translated very well!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|My wife loves this movie. It's  a fun, feel good romantic fantasy.  Drew Barrymore plays an empowered Cinderella whose nobody's victim.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It gets boring at some points and quite a few hard words but other than that it was a good book
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 introduced more complex characters. Sadly some older characters were killed.  They just keep innovating and putting more twists to every episode.  Overall I cannot wait for season 4!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The plot was great. it was an easy ead but a topic for the older crowd. the character development was very good, and descriptive. easy to fallow the different characters and what they did.
B0068RHSZO|2.0|For all the polish on this thriller, something just feels flat about the whole affair.  The set up seems not unfamiliar - Daniel Craig is seen leaving his job as editor to spend more time with his wife Rachel Weisz and two kids.  However, events turn disturbing as they realise the house has a troubled past, and take an even more disturbing turn as their link to the events unfolding past and present becomes gradually apparent, with the help of neighbour Naomi Watts.<br />So far so routine, but the tone of the movie makes some radical shifts, mostly signposted fairly obviously early on in the movie, and by a half of the way in, the movie has really shot its bolt and the remainder is pure autopilot.  For all the tricksiness of the plot and the highly polished production look, there is something oddly mundane and amateur about the end result.  Still, Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz are top talent, so I'm not saying give up on it, just temper your expectations.  Muddled tone and lack of creative energy aside, there is a fairly good germ of an idea here and the cast give it a try.  Shame the creative decision makers couldn't have had faith that the audiences could take something a little rougher round the edges, and smoothed the whole thing out into bland fayre.<br />3/10
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|This movie was really enjoyable and kept your attention very well. Definitely too many naked body scenes to watch with children though.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It seemed a very disjointed untied together story with a very DISSATISFYING ending .....I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It left me hollow inside......and very uneasy...had I known I would not have wasted my time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room is engaging and interesting. I wish it were longer with more levels and more intriguing puzzles. I'm looking forward to the next game from these great gamers!
B005SEYOXW|5.0|This is a fun show that mixes traditional SciFi with a Western/Frontier flare. If you like this, also check out the mivie, Serenity.
B0049IWQJW|5.0|A wonderful film. Great voice actors, beautiful songs (James Taylor!), and a fantastic message. Cars 2 was a bit too rough for my kids, but Cars is terrific.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I would like to buy this but its WAAAY to expensive for an app. I mean come on 7 dollars for a game?  please make it cheaper Amazon!!!!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book strikes a very good balance between the 20th century (and 21st) history of North Korea, along with personal accounts of people who escaped the country. I only wish I had bought it as a physical book rather than a Kindle book, as the photos do not come through as well.
B0081BU42O|4.0|Iain M Banks is one of the few science fiction authors that actually seems to think about the science of what he is proposing. He also dreams big. Really really really big. So his ideas have majesty and grandeur. Sorry, no spoilers, no nit picking the characters to death. None of that. I enjoyed the book, it wasn't any sort of struggle to get the enthusiasm to read it. I had to be told to stop reading several times so we could get on with things like sleeping and going to work. I hope you will enjoy it too.<br /><br />It is very sad that, unless there's a seriously positive surprise, this is the end of the culture line.<br /><br />Cheers Iain, thanks for taking us on this ride.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|The movie is filled with great action scenes but they can go on too long and some were quite predictable. The story actually made sense but the ending went on far too long and it was rather ridiculous how close it came to going Boom! The CGI at the end was ludicrously phony looking compared to the rest of the movie. The fight sequences were excellent compared to previous MI movies where they were obviously phony. If you enjoyed the previous movies or like action movies, this is a good one but there is nothing here to attract the non-fan.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Easy listening got to love her voice. I would go out and buy every Cd she has.  I love her voic
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great acting, terrific scripts. . . Jonny Lee Miller is clearly not a one-persona character.  In Eli Stone, he was funny and ditsy.  Sherlock is darker and much more intense.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am a substitute teacher and had to read a few pages of this to my class and I was hooked.  I had to get my own copy so I could read it and I loved it!
0525478817|5.0|The C word.  Not the profane word, the other one.  The one that can affect your life forever whether you have it or someone close to you does.  Cancer is the main subject matter in The Fault In Our Stars.  I say subject matter, and not that it is what the book is about.  This book is about so much more than cancer.  In fact, I think it's an insult to this book for it be called \\"the cancer book\\".  I've been a fan of the musical RENT since I was 10 years old.  It has always been labeled as \\"the AIDS play\\" even though just like this book, it's so much more than that.  The Fault In Our Stars tells the beautiful story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters.<br /><br />The Fault In Our Stars has been on my radar for quite some time now.  I had noticed that majority of my friends on Goodreads who had read this book had given it 5 stars.  That is a rarity.  So I knew I just had to read this book.  And I just absolutely loved it from the very first chapter.  It's one of those books where you have the urge to skip to the last chapter because you want to know how it ends.  But you resist because you just can't spoil it for yourself.<br /><br />Hazel is the main character in this novel.  She is a sixteen year old living with cancer.  After her mother notices that she's not really living her life, she sends her to a cancer support group.  There she meets Augustus (Gus) a teeanger who is remission.  Now I had been told that this book was a real tear jerker, and to make sure I had tissues on hand.  And yes, it definitely is a tear jerker, but I wasn't expecting it to be so funny.  Both Hazel and Gus are extremely funny.  I laughed out loud numerous times while read this book.  The conversations between these two were just so amusing from the moment they met.  It didn't take much for me to fall for this couple.<br /><br />As your reading this book, you are just rooting for Hazel and Gus.  You want a happily ever after.  There was one particular moment while reading where I just wanted to take a bottle and somehow capture their feelings for each other.  That's how strongly I felt their love for one another.  I wish that every person in life could have a moment like that just once.<br /><br />I had butterflies the entire time I was reading.  There were so many theories running through my head as well.  As I said before I had been told the book was a tear jerker.  And I do not like crying because of a book.  Because it's just gut wrenching for me.  It's one of the reasons why I avoid Nicholas Sparks books.  But it'always those books that you remember.  It means that the author did their job for you have such a powerful emotion, and response to their characters.  John Green definitely did his job, and he did it correctly.  This book is just so beautifully written.  And in case you wondering I did indeed cry...a lot.<br /><br />Reviewed by Sana @ Step Into Fictionst wanted to take a bottle and somehow capture their feelings for each other.

B002Z7FWBI|5.0|A collection to treasure and enjoy for many years.  I am very glad to have bought the DVD's and at such a good price.
B00004RHZU|5.0|This was Pink's first album and had an Hip Hop R&B feel to it. Strong beats with and R&B/ Pop feel
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The CD was a memorable one to have bought and the person has enjoyed it tremendously, a wonderful gift for Sty time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Jan<br /><br />I was hooked on this Victorian style of writing.  I love how the questionable actions in the first of a DVD would be answered later in that same DVD.  No long wait, but still a little bit of &#34;teasing&#34; that good writing will employ.  I can't wait for season four!
B00BRR66SA|4.0|JT does nice work with this album. I like the non-traditional long songs and the hypnotic beats that drive them.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I bought the movie with a low expectation of some good one-liners, fight scenes, and really bad guys. I was pleasantly surprised by the good plot, character interaction, and plausible situations. The only guy that it's not clear what his motive is was the black detective (fear?). I always hate action movies where they jump the shark and it takes me out of the movie. And the one-liners, the material from the bar scene will stick with me awhile. I will re watch and look at reading the books now but apparently it's nothing like the books.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had so much fun with this and I really do hope more games are coming and there will be more puzzles. I love games like this!!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|this was the best series ever! The characters were fully developed , the acting of everyone, superlative.  WOW! We were addicted.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I figured since this was a free read it probably wouldn't be that incredible. Wow! I was proven so wrong by that assumption! I've been disappointed by a great number of books I've read lately. This one went above and beyond my expectations. Sure the story line is a bit unrealistic, but that's why I read! I don't want to read some over the top strict reality crap. That's why I don't watch reality shows. For me reading is about the fantasy and the escape from a mundane reality. I want books like this and sadly they're getting harder to find. I will be checking out other books by this author because she is fabulous. This story is adorable. For anyone who likes a story that doesn't follow realities mundane expectations, take a chance, read this! If you're a romantic, you'll love it. Yes it has explicit sex scenes, but what romance book doesn't? In being honest if a romance book doesn't have at least one it makes me feel cheated. I can't say enough good things about this book except it was the best book I have read in months. I'm off to look for more books by this same author now!<br /><br />I would love recommendations for more books similar to this one! Too many books now days seem to deal with affairs, cheating, and non committed relationships in all genres of romance.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Mis is a wonderful musical and the movie is as good as the stage show. It is a musical that everyone should see.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not seen the movie yet, but knew this book was going to be good. This was a wonderful book and I would recommend it to all!
B000L9IUPM|5.0|If you have trouble sitting still to listen to a great album, then this is not the one to buy.  If you enjoy serious music and love to tap your toes and sing along, then this is the one.  The DVD is just  over the top with clarity, serious sound and terrific show quality.  Each of the Eagles will show the meaning of a real music group.  Each person is ultra talented and places the show just beyond the limits of the couch.  Enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has to be one of the best book Ive read in a while. From the first to the last page was I was competely drawn into this book. I felt as if I felt all sky's emotions and feelings. The writing was amazing! I loved loved loved this book! I will definitely Be reading more of this authors Books :D
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|a little cheesy (Adam Levine, really?), but falls in line with the original series.  I'm intrigued to find out more of Mr. Bloodyface's background story.

B001VZY4M8|5.0|The good old days! One of Neil Young's best. That is of course behind After the Gold Rush.  Like most of Neil's albums, easy to sit and listen to the entire thing without hesitation.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I pre-ordered this movie as part of a combo (with Tangled) and it came here within a few short days of it's release.  Saw the movie in theaters like 3-4 times (it was just that Awesome) and I have enjoyed watching it many times since then.  Planning on sharing this movie with my cousins when they come up to visit.  Would definitely recommend this seller to anyone.

B004G6009U|5.0|I was first introduced to this movie by my uncle who has 2 kids of his own and I loved it.  Even though this is a CGI animated Disney fairy tale, it still feels like a Disney classic.  I ordered this movie as part of a combo (along with my pre-order of Wreck-It Ralph) and it arrived within a few short days of Wreck-It Ralph's release.  It is such a great movie (SPOILER ALERT:  I nearly cried when Eugene died at the end.) that I've watched it numerous times since receiving it.  I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone.
055380684X|3.0|Good material but most people looking for the answer to the question it addresses have probably heard it all before...Not putting it down, just saying , not really anything new.
B00B1MHA18|5.0|combining Ben Harper's voice and style with a blues legend is an amazing combo, as much as I enjoy Ben on his normal stuff this album really clicks with me.  some powerful blues songs like &#34;I ride at dawn&#34; and some straight up blues jams it's a fun ride with a cool combo of blues guitar, harmonica, and Ben's voice.  the songs are well written, no idea if they're old or new but try the preview on Amazon for a taste and if you like what you hear you'll love this release.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode are my favourite of all time and I have to say I am NEVER disappointed.  This album has feeling and intensity just like all other DM albums.  Words cannot explain ..just listen to it.  If you are a fan of any or all DM albums, do not hesitate ..buy this!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really like this series. The characters and plots are wonderful. Was sucked into the story after the first episode.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I am collecting the whole series to watch over and over again with my family ..nice to have the option to see it at home when I want.

B00ABKGG0C|3.0|Posting this review from my mobile so it won't be too long.<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews, bit I'm compelled to say a word or two about this book simply because the amazon rating doesn't quite fit the overall quality and writing of this work. Five stars in my opinion should be reserved for fantasy masterpieces like name of the wind, game of thrones  and the hobbit.<br /><br />While this book has an intriguing and original storyline,  the characters aren't fleshed out enough for me to feel any sort of emotional attachment.<br /><br />By around three quarters of the way through the book, I found myself bored and had to force my way through the conclusion.<br /><br />Not a bad book overall, but not as good as the five stars would indicate.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Really enjoyed it. Slightly predictable twists, but still a good book.  Looking forward to reading the next book in this series.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|At first I really liked this game. The graphics are great, it is a fun challenge and if you grew up a JAWS fan, it is just fun. But you can NEVER get through the game!!!! After investing lots of time and even money, the game resets itself when you get to the great white and that is truly infuriating!
B004P02OJ6|5.0|Amazing drama, man,wife and child, versus a flawed justice system. Man,woman and child win this time.If only all could be so lucky. :)
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner and knew I would get another great read from Khaled Hosseini but didn't expect as consuming a read. I was pleasantly surprised and was hooked by this one too. Inspiring in the strength of the female characters and at the same time heartbreaking at their acceptance of abuse and lack of respect.<br />Recommended to all my friends.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Sorry, but is was just terribile in my opinion although could be liked by romance book fans. So terribily predictable and the writing was bad!

B001SGEUMY|5.0|My favorite band, plain and simple. I go back and forth with this being my favorite album they ever put out - this is the second copy of this album I've bought (my first CD from 2005 was beat up so I bought a digital copy from Amazon and thankfully received a physical copy in the mail a few days later)...so for me it's a must have! In my opinion, music-wise it's a definite step toward the hard rock side and shows the guys' maturity with nice layers of sound & production. Not talking Be Here Now layers and over-production...but clean, well-thought parts spanning a handful of sensible instruments. This was a great tour as well - having seen Oasis nine or ten times, this one of my favorite pair of shows. Have a listen if you haven't before, not to be disappointed!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am not a teenager, I am a 30 something, mom of two, but I LOVE this show!! It has great chemistry among the lead actresses and twists and turns that you never see coming! I especially love the little nuggets or mini-cliffhangers left by 'A' at the end of each episode, it definitely makes you excited for the next one!!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I think the movie had a nice message, but compared to other animated/Disney movies I've ever seen, it was just okay to me. Try it for yourself though!

B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I broke down and purchased GoT because I couldn't wait any longer to see it. I'm so glad I did--the show is very entertaining and worth the purchase. If I had waited for the series to be available from the Library, I'd still be on the waiting list at number six hundred and something...
B0058YPL66|5.0|The residents of STORYBROOKE, MAINE are living in a dream world totally unaware they are actually fairy tale characters cursed to live in the \\"real\\" world. A simple premise that provides a remarkable journey into mesmerizing storytelling and a complete visual explosion of color and detail. ONCE UPON A TIME is a totally fresh take on beloved fairy tales. The writers revel in telling a completely new version of these beloved tales and they create a visual feast for viewers who'll find they can't get enough of this inventive series.<br /><br />Troubled Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is about to enter a new realm of reality when the son she gave up for adoption 10 years ago suddenly appears to appeal for her help. Jared Gilmore is a pure treasure as precocious Henry Mills. Thanks to the magic of a fairy tale book, 10-year-old Henry knows the true story of the residents of Storybrooke. He knows that only an unbelieving Emma can break the curse and return the residents to their enchanted fairy tale lives. Gilmore is just a pure delight as young Henry.<br /><br />ONCE UPON A TIME is delightfully fresh in its creative retelling of beloved fairy tales. Here we get the back story of Snow White and her Prince Charming, Little Red Riding Hood, The Evil Queen, Rumplestiltskin and so many more characters. The writers have a free reign to create stories from their imaginations. What evil let Jiminy to become a cricket and eventually have a conscience? What is the real reason the Evil Queen hated Snow White? In this version, \\"the fairest of them all\\" has been replaced with a far darker reason.<br /><br />This truly lavish production  seems to relish its desire for detail in costume, setting and character.<br />ONCE UPON A TIME seems to be a collision of ABC's hit series LOST and HBO's GAME OF THRONES. The show jumps back and forth between the present and past as we learn each character's back story and the fairy tale times are reminiscent of medieval days. Even LOST's Emilie de Ravin is one of the stars is as the beautiful and endearing Belle who can see a person's inner beauty.<br /><br />A perfect cast was assembled to create characters in their fairy tale lands and in \\"reality.\\" Lana Parrilla is strikingly delicious and gorgeous in her roles at Storybrooke mayor Regina Mills and as the original Evil Queen.<br />Her sultry evil is framed by a beauty so overwelming that any fairy tale or real man would collapse at her feet with desire. Ginnifer Goodwin as Storybrooke's Mary Margaret is a more sedate and a much less \\"fairest of them all\\" version of Snow White. Snow has a story and it is not always pretty. Topping off the cast is Robert Carlyle as the evil Rumplestiltskin and town miscreant Mr. Gold. Here is a one of a kind cast that simply fills the screen with their savory interpretations of their fairy tale and reality versions.<br /><br />Another person of note is Josh Dallas as David Nolan and Prince Charming. His love of Snow White (Mary Margaret)overcomes the barriers of time and location yet their star-crossed love is constantly undermined by cirumstances beyond their control. Dallas is perfect as Charming with a great sense of humanity and humility. His facial expressions convey a charm that is unequaled and this Prince Charming does not shy away from shedding a few tears when needed.<br /><br />Having sung the praises of ONCE UPON A TIME, there are flaws. New characters are constantly being introduced--talk about a cast of thousands. Each new character has his or her own back story and the stories are interwoven with other character--though, in the original fairy tales, the characters are separated by their own stories. It can be exhausting to keep track of everyone and who is good and who is bad.<br /><br />Halfway through the season, the show loses steam with an annoying plot in which one our the main characters is accused of murder and arrested. The plot drags on in its silliness and its clear that Storybrooke has an inept judicialsystem. Hey, this seemingly large town has ONE sheriff and no police force. It's just another chance for Lana and Mr. Gold to continue their fairy tale fight into the real world.<br /><br />Lovely Jennifer Morrison is under-utilized throughout much of the season looking positively dowdy hidden under a large women cap. She is growing closer to Henry as her fight with Regina intensifies. Only in the season finale do we see what a talented actress Morrison is when finally given the chance. Season two will certainly reveal more.<br /><br />Here is a show that has pizzaz. It's so rare to see a production where all the pieces fall into place. It's clear that the actors are having a great time and the writers are loving the chance to recreate fairy tales. Add in costume designers, set decorators, and an all-around perfect crew and you find the magic--the magic of ONCE UPON A TIME.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Saw band on SNL and ordered cd.  Not disappointed at all.  Listen to it frequently. Doesn't get old.  I would recommend.
B001OFJPIS|3.0|A fun action movie with a fair amount of cliche' romantic involvements. Granted, what I'm calling cliche' includes demons, fish people, elves, and fire starters falling in love.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, but it's not nearly as good as the first.

B00BF123WG|5.0|This is a compelling film, one that was cheated from getting the Oscar.  Jessica Chastain is even more riveting, and also cheated from getting the Oscar.  Her role as it interacts with male counterparts underscores how little credit women get for doing so much.<br />A great film!
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I totally enjoyed it it reminded me of me and my son so cute thanks a bunch really enjoyable you gotta see this
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Loved the movie but I stand with others on this. This is pure corporate greed! Some people in the same household don't like or can't watch 3D movies. I always felt the way they packaged 3D with 2D was perfect! Now they're getting greedy! What a shame!

B00BQI4AU6|5.0|The bottom line: The Way Life Goes is full of great songs. There's little point in even trying to give a song-by-song review. I would be unable to even name a favorite considering the quality of songs like Cold Day in Hell, Ask Me Yesterday, Different Light, etc.<br />If you liked Cinderella, it's a no-brainer: get this recording. Even if you never heard of Cinderella, give this a listen.<br />Tom: Congrats on making a great album.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|But, I guess I'm glad I did, because now I don't have to wait a week to know what happened... In fact, I'd say that you should miss all good series on cable and TV, and watch them in marathons! :-)))<br />One of the things I love about the series is the lengths the Director and Producer went to, for the scenes to &#34;look authentic&#34;... Yes, there are some modern saddles, weapons out of place... But what the heck... I haven't seen one power line or man hole cover yet! And it is a fantasy series, so what ever they say is good, is good... I'm a picky bloke, and really get pulled out of &#34;the spell&#34; easily by huge errors, or bad direction... So for me to say that I'm &#34;right there&#34; for every episode, is quite the accolade! If you haven't seen Thrones... I envy you... you have all that good stuff to come. Enjoy!!!
1452101248|3.0|Beautiful book, but not super user friendly. I will continue to cook from this, but have to amend most recipes to work with what's available in my cupboard and affordable ingredients. Not sure I would buy it again, especially for the price.
B00C1XZ2LQ|3.0|Although clean, the dynamic range of the overall production are a bit too extreme, causing me to have to constantly adjust the volume unless I'm listing in a studio environment.<br /><br />This works for the soundtrack if you are in the theater, but the experience is not as enjoyable and causes listening fatigue because you have to focus on it just to hear it - no passive listening.<br /><br />Additionally, the thematic elements are very familiar and sound similar to Tron and the Dark Night trilogy. Although fine, this fails to give the soundtrack it's own sense of identity.
1423101472|5.0|LOVE the Percy Jackson series! Need to read everything by this author!! This author has also written the Kane series and the Lost Hero series- worth reading into!

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|If you are an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, you'll want to own this 25th Anniversary production of &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34;.  Production values are very high, with breathtaking video and stunning audio.  The cast is excellent, and the final celebration reunites past and present cast members.  The Royal Albert Hall is a great venue for this production.  This type of production really shows off Blu-Ray's capabilities.
B008476HBM|5.0|Always one of my favorites. I love this story better than any of Jane Austen's other works. It is one of the few books I've read more than once. There's a reason why any book becomes a classic. This one deserves that title.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Such a wonderful novel.  Good story.  Well written.  Interesting characters (There should be another book just about Rose McFadden).  This is a book you will be recommending to others.  I can't wait for the upcoming sequel.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I've been a fan of Ken Follett for years and have read many of his novels-some more than once.  I love his style of writing with its historical backdrop in many instances (world wars, slavery). That Jackdaws was set during World War II added to the suspense and historical value of the novel.  He weaves romantic content into the story in a masterful way.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This book is a refreshingly neutral look at the build-up to and crash associated with the financial crisis of 07-08.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|Very well-written and compelling exposition of life in North Korea and afterwards in South Korea for people who defected. This book offers a window into the bizarre and twisted Orwellian state. Recommended highly.

B0083Z6AH6|4.0|An engrossing read. It follows the similar pattern that Jane Austen uses with an unlikely heroine who holds true to herself and overcomes the obstacles in her way to get the man of her dreams. A very easy read.
1423140591|5.0|Weaving classic mythology into modern times, spiced with humor and sprinkled with lots of adventure ... my son will actually forego the TV for this book (and series).  Exemplary delivery time ...two days.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great flick. Terrible streaming quality. Step your game up amazon. The movie froze at least 7 times while I was watching.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I think this game is very cool because you get to do 2 of those little guys instead of one so it is a little more challenging.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Super fun and cute game love how realistic everything is. Like the movie very entertaining I would recommend this app and best of all it was free.
B000Q99EAC|3.0|Good movie , but bad exp steaming from amazon. Same experience for few other movies that i downloaded. I like the movie though
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The writer does a good job of making the reader interested in two fairly unlikeable people.  Great character portrayal and enough twists to make you question the conclusions you've already reached.  Setting of a decaying American town also convincing.  But don't read the book if you're feeling depressed about relationships in general - it's a very cynical read!!!
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|I liked Jason Momoa in Game of Thrones. Easily my favorite character. (Spoiler Alert)..... He was killed off and I was left wanting to see him conquer the world. He did so in this movie, but the plot and dialogue was cheesy.
B005V20JKI|1.0|First off, I want to say... this is, at least was, one of the best games out there. Now, why did I give it a 1 star review? I want you all to know that if you have progressed a lot (like me)... Don't get the update if you haven't already. Why? (1) First of all, it wipes your progress, it's basically reset. (2) Second of all, you have to pay $2.00 to play the other 1/2, more like 3/4 of the game after finishing a few of the levels. (3) Third, once you max out your player levels, you have to pay to use points to buy some upgrades and that kind of stuff. Plus, you have to pay $1.00 just for 5 [upgrade] points. 5 upgrade points for $1.00? The points used to be free...CHANGE IT BACK!!!! (4) Fourth, the gameplay is easier, much much easier...so easy that I literally finished the game (all levels unlocked and beat) in just about 30 minutes...short gameplay...why?<br />  To tell you the truth, this used to be one of my favorite games on the Ama-Droid (Amazon-Android) app store. I played this game a lot, especially with friends in multiplayer. Really Angry Mob Games? Really? This is now just a rip off game/app.<br />  I tell you, DO NOT UPDATE THIS GAME!!!! And for all those reading this and are thinking about buying this game...DO NOT BUY THIS RIP OFF GAME!!!!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|One of the best period movies of all time. Its graphic, violent, graphic, and Scottish. Whats not to like? right?

1594746168|3.0|\\"The Resurrectionist\\" is two books in one. The first half is a series of anecdotes, sketches, and notes about the fictional Dr. Spencer Black's slow descent into madness.  The world's first plastic surgeon, he excelled at helping the deformed, but slowly came to see deformities and mutations as the human form's attempt to return to its mythic roots. Eventually, Black becomes the Dr. Frankenstein of his age, shifting from healing to creating new forms from corpses, one harpy and mermaid at a time.  By the time Black is debuting his monstrosities at a carnival, we know he's gone off the deep end.<br /><br />Will Black discover the secret to reanimation?  It'd be a boring story if he didn't.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a series of anatomical studies of mythical beasts.  With the exception of the siren/harpy, it's only skin deep: muscle and bones are given scientific names, peeled back layer by layer. It's worth mentioning that none of these creatures are supposed to be the actual beast, but rather Black's reproduction.  Which means that in essence we're looking at a copy of a copy.<br /><br />The creatures are all meticulously detailed, although it's peculiar there's an Eastern dragon and not a Western version. All of the typical permutations of the human form are present: minotaurs, centaurs, satyrs, mermaids...but there are others too, like the chimera and the Cerberus.  Curiously, no attempt is made to harmonize the beasts' forms. The chimera is literally a goat, a lion, and a snake grafted together¸ with their three spines fused into one.<br /><br />The publisher invites the curious to explore more on its web site, but there's nothing there - the interior page views don't work, robbing readers of the opportunity to zoom in on certain details.<br /><br />It's a bit like seeing a puppeteer's hand beneath a puppet - once you see it, you can't help but start asking questions. Given that we're getting a detailed look under these mythical creatures' hoods, so to speak¸ the book seems to invite these questions but never answers them.  Black's notes make vague allusions to \\"air sacks\\" that allow the winged beasts to fly, but never explains how they work. And the aforementioned fused bones seem like lazy design. Shouldn't the sphinx, legendary of eating humans, have a different set of teeth? How does the cold-blooded nature of a snake integrate with a chimera's presumably warm-blooded two-thirds? How in the world does a satyr stand upright on tiny little goat feet? \\"The Resurrectionist\\" has no answers.<br /><br />It simply presents, with the intent of unnerving the reader, an intimate look at the insides of creatures we would normally gawk at from afar. The book might have application in role-playing games where necromancy is prominent. But like Black's traveling sideshow, it's a curiosity that only momentarily distracts us from the next act.so to speak¸ the book seems to invite these questions but never answers them.

Read or appreciate the art work.  Double tap SHARPLY on the enlargement.  Awkward, but better than nothing.  Wimpy taps will not work, btw, or ones that are too long.  Quick and sharp.<br /><br />I bought this book on Kindle to use the features. I have the hard copy. I went through the Kindle entry and found nothing warning me that no Kindle features worked on this book. If I had been warned I wouldn't have purchased it. It did warn that it was only available on Kindle and not the PC reader, but I thought that's OK.<br /><br />I feel quite scammed. If Kindle features will not be available on a book the entry should say so to allow the buyer to make an INFORMED decision. Shame on you Amazon. Shame.

B00BB67UNW|4.0|For those who remember how tightly written and brilliantly acted television's BOSS pushed the covers back on Chicago's gamey political tales the perhaps BROKEN CITY will be a disappointment.  As written by Brian Tucker and directed by Allen Hughes this film comes off as a bit disjointed with some very confusing story developments that are so mumbled by the cast that subtitles might be necessary to stay involved.  But do we want to be involved in a story where every character is crooked? Usually there is at least one redeeming force that makes the light shining on all the evil around seem justified, but not here: everyone involved is essentially a bad guy.<br /><br />NYPD detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is arrested for the murder of Mikey Tavarez, who raped and murdered the sixteen-year-old sister of Taggart's girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez). His friend, Captain Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) asks Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) for help, and Hostetler eliminates the evidence against Taggart. Tavarez's death is ruled as self-defense, and Taggart is forced to leave the police. Seven years later, Taggart is a private detective on the verge of bankruptcy when he's hired by Hostetler to find out who his wife Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair with. Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw (Alona Ta, the one bright light in the film), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), the campaign manager of Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). But even that is a sham and a mistake that drives everyone into even deeper depths of evil.  Even our given hero Billy Taggart returns of his alcohol abuse and despite his efforts to make things right meets all manner of surprise changes that simply don't hang together.<br /><br />The cast of fine actors do the best they can with this creaky story and in addition to the stars mentioned, the smaller roles are well filled by Michael Beach, James Ransome and Griffin Dunne. The film is dark, tosses in the usual car chases, and in general entertains but leaves a bitter aftertaste about American politics. Grady Harp, May 13y Michael Beach, James Ransome and Griffin Dunne.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I purchased this book in October, 2011, and immediately read it.  I eliminated wheat right away--even before finishing the book.  I bought it as a DIET book, but I quickly learned by the health results I was getting that this is NOT a DIET, in the sense of just wanting to lose some weight.  WB is NOT a &#34;diet&#34; and it is NOT about being gluten free.  In fact, Dr. D stresses in the book, on his blog, in his speeches, and on his facebook page that we should NOT eat gluten free foods, because the wheat/gluten is only being replaced by junk ingredients that are very high in carbs.  WB is all about being low carb and eating whole, natural foods that don't cause blood sugar spikes which are the real problem with obesity, diabetes, etc.  I eat good saturated fats (butter, lard, coconut oil--don't faint!!) and protein. Carbs come from healthy veggies, but are limited to 50 carb grams a day or under.<br /><br />I personally have lost over 60 pounds in the time I have been following the WB WOE.  (Remember, that's Way of Eating, not being unhappy or sad about what I eat.)  My arthritis has quit hurting.  I took Celebrex for 13 years and stopped it a couple of weeks into WB.  I just don't have joint pain anymore.  I had surgery for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome two weeks before starting WB and was supposed to go back to have the other hand/wrist done.  I didn't have to do that, because all the symptoms of CTS are totally gone (unless I accidentally get &#34;wheated&#34;).<br /><br />I also quit taking Nexium for acid reflux after a couple of weeks of doing WB. I am 69 and haven't felt this good or had so few health problems in 40 years.  My blood sugar levels which were prediabetic became normal soon after starting WB.<br /><br />So, yes, I would give this book 10 STARS if I could!  Don't think you can do this without the book.  You have to understand the &#34;health&#34; behind it, and that is all explained in the book.  I not only bought the hard cover book nearly 19 months ago, I just recently downloaded the Kindle version to my iPad!  And make that ditto for the Wheat Belly Cookbook by Dr. Davis.  I have the hard copy and the Kindle version.  YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE, TOO.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|This movie never fails to inspire hilarity. I bought it so that I could introduce my 13 year old daughter to \\"my\\" brand of humor. Now she is constantly looking for excuses to quote it. Good stuff!
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This has to be one of the most fun stories I've read in a long time. Extraordinary (yet entirely possible) happenings throughout the old man's life include his past and present. If you want an easy, entertaining, adventure-filled read, pick this one.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Kept me coming back for the next one! Season 2 around the corner. Can't wait to see where season 2 takes this.
B005J2UM9S|2.0|Its ok, bad ending, could have been better, went from Ghost Hunter believable to the extreme.... I guess if you're bored, grab a beer and enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book wasn't so well-written and certainly didn't hold my attention as well as the first book, but I wanted to keep reading to know how the characters developed.
0786958731|5.0|Great with 3+ players but I have played it a few times solo. Cool game, great characters, cant go wrong with this one.... many options for playing.
B001U887X8|5.0|If your feet hurt you so have to put this on. I where them on my day off. They make my feet fell happy! LOL
0375851569|5.0|I bought this for my 5 year old son. They are good starter books if you are just getting into Dr. Seuss.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|Fun game but challenging. Takes a bit of time to get the skill and coordination down. But fun after you learn it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love his books cannot put them down.  I always make sure that I get the next book when I am close to finishing, that is what I love about the Kindle.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could hardly put this book down.  I was morbidly fascinated with these two people who so willingly made role-playing their lives.  We all play various roles at home, at work, during our leisure and charitable activities. But Amy and Nick take it to a frightening extreme. I found the book well-written and worth the time I spent on it. I was a little disappointed in the ending, as i found it somewhat predictable.
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|Great album by Perth, Australia's own Tame Impalla. It's an a complete album that works from start to finish. Get it!
B00C0W08XK|5.0|Smooth &amp; by the numbers. A joy to play. With four difficulty levels to choose from there is a grid for everybody.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|Definitely the best from the Beatles. You can hear so many of today's music genres on this album. They may not be the best in each of these genres, but they were definitely the pioneers.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down, even tho its finals week. Loved it always wanted to know what happened next. Couldn't put it down.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|a lot of great songs on this CD.  I am glad I purchased it.  The instant download was really cool too!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|I know not all of it is TRADITIONAL country, but most of the song make me want to get up and dance or make me feel warm and fuzzy.<br />I love it!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|This is my favorite album of all.  The instant download was great, and I keep the cd in the car.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very well written, with an illustrating historical background, above that a moral about wars (and armies). I read it almost without pause.
1451695195|3.0|I was impressed about the story of his sister leading him. However, he tended to ramble on more that I liked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers a great game it is so cute and I recommend it to little kids. Unlike temple run you don't have to turn your tablet to get the coins you just slide land. I don't have anything agents temple run I like them equal. The only thing I have agents subway surfers is that every time you go to home on it there's always an add.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I have completed my set of all the twilight movies now. I am happy to have not only the movies, but all the books too.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game. Hours of entertainment mixing/breeding dragons. Caution for parents, as there are in-game purchases that can be made for real money. There are guests available but not required for progress in the game. Also, there are limited time dragons available that can cause frustration. Still, overall a very fun and enjoyable game.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and am glad that I added it to my collection, even though I had never heard of it before.
B0099LDUFI|3.0|I probably should've just bought the three songs I knew I wanted (&#34;Blow Me (One Last Kiss),&#34; &#34;Try,&#34; and &#34;Just Give Me A Reason&#34;), but I figured that if I already liked that many songs on one album I was sure to like the rest. I was wrong. The only other songs I really like are &#34;The Great Escape&#34; and &#34;Here Comes the Weekend.&#34;
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very cool book.  What made this interesting is that in a lot of ways, the main character is very childish in his thinking.  But he is honest, he explains everything he does, even if its a little much at times.  Its sad to think that things might've ended up differently for him, its also sad to think that the events in this book were the only thing capable of changing a man like him.  You have so many things occurring  to really make you think about your life, and its fun to read and make comparisons.<br />All in all, a great read.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I watched it with my Book Club every one loved the movie and we had all read the book a few years earlier. It was a masterpiece of acting and photography and the movie stayed true to the book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The story behind this series is incredible! A definite read! More realistic than  50 shades. A great continuation from book one and the love story of two people who have been through more than most but finding their way together. Beautiful love story - I am a sucker for romance :)
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|/Could not have imagined the movie would have been better than the live stage versin but it was. Fabulous acting and singing and went way above my expectations.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I liked this product for the price the condiction it was in it met my expectations will refer to any of my friends and family
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm not even sure why, but this game is very addictive.  The only draw back is all the time you'll waste playing it.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|My kids had introduced me to this band as my son had bought the EP last year.  I haven't been this impressed by a band in YEARS!  Every song on this album is incredibly good.  My personal favorite is \\"Afraid\\" but I love listening to the entire album.  The Neighbourhood was just in town here for a music festival and they sound great live as well.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Never knew the show existed until it came on Prime Instant Videos, love the show, love my Prime. Just started watching season 2.
0307352153|3.0|Ok. I am an introvert. I know I am. I am very quiet and reserved when I am around people who do not know me.<br /><br />I was really excited to read this book. Maybe it was just me, but I felt bored with it. It was very much like reading a textbook. Not something I wanted to do in my spare time at the moment while I am reading textbook after textbook. But I pressed on. And with little luck and motivation, I found it very dull and boring. I'm sorry to say, that I was not able to finish it. Maybe I will at some other time. Here's hoping, because I was so looking forward to this.<br /><br />I know a lot of people had rave reviews about it. I guess I'm just not seeing what they are.
B00003CX5P|1.0|why would anyone pay ghix ridiculously high price for the worst of the series on dvd? you can get the original trilogy on Blu-ray for less
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I thought this movie was very entertaining with superb acting.  I would recommend this movie to all my friends!  BRAVO!!
B00AW28HF6|3.0|I was gifted Tsunami Connection for a non-reciprocal review.<br /><br />The Positives:<br /><br />Tsunami Connection is a multi-layered, three-dimensional work that has clearly been well-researched, thoroughly planned and executed with precision. I have had the fortune of visiting some of the exotic locations mentioned in the book, and the details are spot on. Detail extends beyond the geographical; any and every subject matter that features in Tsunami Connection is thoroughly and convincingly researched.<br /><br />The plot follows a fairly conventional political thriller theme, yet the twists and turns are unpredictable and the pace bounces along at a comfortable rate, introducing characters, relationships and events with good rhythm. The depth of the plot adds a reassuringly richness to the book, giving the reader confidence that it won't unravel in a disappointing manner - which it doesn't.<br /><br />The Negatives:<br /><br />I found the style of writing difficult to get along with, which is a shame, because the rest of the book was so complete. Description, although detailed and well-informed, came across in an almost journalistic way, laying out the picture with a matter-of-fact starkness that wasn't to my taste. This isn't to say that my feelings are to be mirrored by everyone - this is purely preference.<br /><br />The writing style extended to dialogue, which had a very unnatural, stilted quality to it that was almost robotic, lacking in a certain humanity that makes people feel like people. As an extension of the characters, I also felt that the sex scenes seemed out of place within the book. It's not to do with prudishness on my part - sex has its place - but the graphical nature of the scenes stuck out as feeling like a different book entirely. By way of analogy, imagine a graphically hardcore scene in the middle of any of the Bourne films - it would dismember the plot.<br /><br />The Summary:<br /><br />There is a lot to like here. I personally didn'tget on with the prose itself, but I understand the author is having the book edited. Perhaps after the editing, the plot, depth and detail will get that final coat of polish it deserves.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Beautiful visuals with some depth of history behind the stories. I would prefer a bit more reality since it is all very polished.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|it was a good move to have jennifer carpenter's character involved in dexter's secret..i was losing interest in the ridiculous season 6...now there is more drama and who<br />knows where the writers will take it from here...the fact that the two main characters divorced in real life adds to their perfomances in this season...
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|After searching the app store, the quickest recorder seemed to be the 'easy pro' one. When I downloaded the app, I could record just fine, but when I clicked on the record I had just made, it had no sound. I could not listen to any of them. This app wasn't useful and I want a refund.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|VERY HAPPY WITH THIS BUY. MAKES READING WHEN I CAN NOT HOLD MY KINDLE FIRE SO MUCH EASIER. GLAD I BOUGHT IT.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I would give this game 5 stars because of the challenges and that it is super fun. I can barely put it down to play another game on my Kindle fire!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Got this game on a whim and I love it. Not only is it fun but it also entertainments kids. Great game to play with the family I highly recommend it for everyone to at least try.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The new P.O.V chapters are hard to get into at first, but they get better. I'm glad that less characters die in this book, but I sorely miss Dany & Tyrions chapters.
B001BANK32|5.0|I really adore this book.  It is well paced, action packed and of course scary.  Stephen King rolls out an intricate plot that keeps you guessing until the very end.  Overall, a masterpiece.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|One of Depeche Mode's best release.  I love all of their music, but this one reminds of the days of Violator.  Money worth well spent.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had the free version of this game and have played the full version on my friends ipod. I just LOVE that I know the greatest secret to finding diamonds!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Mr. Connelly sure knows how to bring words to life, and bring readers to the edge of their seats, as Harry Bosch seeks to solve a twenty-year unsolvable crime, despite the efforts of departmental higher-ups to stop him. You won't be able to stop reading.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|This review is in response to those giving this product one star for being too expensive:<br /><br />I got my set today and have watched three episodes so far.  Even though I already own the first two seasons in Blu-Ray, I'm still totally blown away by the quality of the picture.  It is just amazing to see such a clear image and vibrant colors and updated special efx.<br /><br />Things I've noticed so far that I could not have noticed from the regular DVD's : In the first few episodes Wil Wheaton has some really bad acne problems going on and every tiny little mole and pimple show up amazingly clear (okay so that's NOT so awesome, but it's there), I've noticed a smudge of eyeliner under Dr. Crusher's eye for an entire scene, a dirt stain on the Captain's sleeve, but my favorite thing to do is to pause the playback when they show computer text on the LCARS screen.  You could never read what the designers wrote until now, and let me tell you, they had a really warped sense of humor.  I was actually laughing out loud at some of the things they wrote in \\"Ensigns of Command\\" for the Sheliac Treaty.  I won't spoil it, you'll have to discover it yourself.<br /><br />And finally, along with the hi-def bloopers, we finally get to see footage of David Rappaport as the original Kivas Fajo in \\"The Most Toys\\".  Again, that alone is worth the price of admission, a very rare (albeit sad) treat for TNG fans.<br /><br />I don't have a lot of money, I'm out of work on disability and have to make every penny count.  But I can tell you I would have gladly paid more for this set of episodes, and I can't wait until the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th seasons to come out.  I'll never get tired of watching TNG in this format, it's truly beautiful work they've done in putting all this together!<br /><br />EDIT: You know I just realized something that some of you might already have figured out, ALL of the 1 star reviews, with the exception of one (so far) are not even reviews for the Blu-ray set!!!<br />If you look carefully at the sub-headings, you'll see that all those reviews are either for the DVD or for ONE episode from Amazon's Instant Video!  These reviewers were reviewing the right thing but AMAZON lumped those reviews together with the Blu-Ray reviews.  So I have no doubt that when a person reported poor quality video while trying to stream one of these episodes, if you don't look closely enough you won't even realize they are not talking about the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />NOTE TO AMAZON:  Could you please do a better job of organizing these reviews.  You are putting these 1 star reviews mixed in to this product that are not even meant to be here!/>If you look carefully at the sub-headings, you'll see that all those reviews are either for the DVD or for ONE episode from Amazon's Instant Video!

B008X9Z37A|5.0|I needed something to protect my new Kindle Fire HD. Because of how I carry the device (in a shoulder bag), I was concerned about scratching the glass screen. I was also looking for something a bit less costly than the Amazon recommended case. It does what I need it to do and that is good enough.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am the least tech savvy person I know. This app is easy to download and use. I highly recommend it.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|I love this game! I play on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. and bought it mainly as a time killer for those waiting situations, I now find myself playing every free moment and even putting off things I should be doing, to play.  The different difficulty settings mean the game is virtually accessible to anybody, I play on the hard setting, it is enough of a challenge for me, usually having to play each scenario a few times before I find a strategy that works.<br /><br />The game is basically a real-time strategy game, that involves resources(the towns), the more you have the faster your ship building rate.  You build ships to battle and take ownership of islands between you and your enemy with the idea to eventually take down the enemy base.  Highly recommended...if you have the time.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Kinsella never disappoints. Always funny, great plot. You never want to set the book down.  I just love every single book of hers.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is one of the most awesome free apps I have ever played. It works very well. You should try it!
B00846REIS|1.0|Absolutely boring.  Everything happens so fast, so easy, characters are predictable, everything is the same, the book begins and ends with zero emotion.  I would NEVER recommend this.  Have know idea why it has such high standards in the best seller list....
0811879542|5.0|My 3-year old daughter loves, loves, loves this book.  Shaking, pressing and tilting the book to magically move around the dots keeps her interested and amazed.  It's fun for us, too!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love this show and characters can't wait till the next season. recommend to all those who like dramas two thumbs up
B001N3GUIE|3.0|The moral of the story is quite true, but the way it is presented (as an invisible monster created by the id or self) is kind of childish....
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Funny, Funny, Funny!  Classic Bundy Humor.  One of the best comedic series ever - broke a lot of boundaries and holds up well.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I intended to read this before seeing Les Miz in Baltimore.  Yikes!  It is SO LONG!....but wonderful!  I loved the musical and now my goal is to read the whole book as a summer project.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Great concept. The ending was a little too hurried and \\"clean\\", but for the most part well fleshed out characters and engaging storyline.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't need to say anything more. Flat out best book ever! 5. I usually don't read this type of book but so glad as d my sister loaned it to me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode is still exciting and scares me half to death!  Of course, I'm a chicken so it doesn't take much but still...
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Great graphics great game .It channels the original sonic with an more modern twist. It is exciting and you'll never get bored playing this amazing game!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The Rose;  This is, without a doubt, the best TV I've watched in a long time.  It has been since the Sopranos were brand new, that I have been this excited about, and to watch, a TV show.<br /><br />The Thorn;  The fact the Blu-Ray and DVD isn't released until 9 months after the season ends.<br /><br />Make better choices, HBO.
0312330537|5.0|I read this while traveling through India last month.  Though the book has about 900 pages i finished it pretty quickly because it's one of those books that are almost impossible to put down.  I even read it while sipping a beer at Leopold's in Mumbai...
B000FA675C|4.0|It was great suspenseful. Some times I could not put it down. It was tax time so I had to put it down. Great read .looking forward to more of this author.John
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|I don't know if I will get through all 500 plus recipes, but the ones I have made yet so far have been a culinary delight!
B007R4WENS|5.0|This application has everything I was looking for.  Great tools for practice and for song composition. I highly recommended it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Great for short videos but would be nice to be able to download full movie or TV videos. Add this capability and it will definitely be 5 stars.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie... Suspenseful AND funny... Was a ton of fun to watch, with a great cast. Incredible that it is or was at least based on a true story
B0084AXZK0|2.0|I had seen the movie years ago and thought I would enjoy the book, guess its just dated in its wording and the characters.  Disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very cool game it's fun to play when you have nothing to play with.  Also is a little expensive on the characters.I also think that you should have more keys when you first download the app.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The writer has shown many evidences of the process and importance in habit building. Helpful in my habit building. Many thanks!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this app.! Stay in touch with family & friends on daily basis . Be able to post pics . To family & friend to view and keep on their facebook page.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|It's a bit violent for me, but I am pretty hooked on it. Amazing visual effects transport you to a mythical medieval world
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Hard to put down but when you do its easy to pick back up and be carried off again. Definitely a story that stays with you.
078322740X|4.0|What a duo... Not a bad show! I liked it! Two characters who are unlikeable, later becomes likable.  Hmmmm could they be after the wrong goal, or the wrong mate? That is all I am saying about this movie.  Watch for yourself as they paired these two well.  The other time they paired them was the Out of Towners 1999 not as good, but they are a good pair of actors together.
B00BKBCF38|4.0|Not quite a straight-ahead metalpop as the first album, but it has grown on me.  A little more experimental and a LITTLE proggier than the first.
B000K7UBTI|3.0|This show was okay, I like The Robert Downy JR. Movies much better! Spiderman animated series and The Incredible hulk Animated series 2 of the best, in the 1990's are STILL not on DVD!!! GRRR Marvel!!! GRRRR
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just way too much fun and addictive. Could play for hours.<br /><br />My kids haven't even had a chance to try it yet lol
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We have watched the entire series multiple times.  It's even better in Blu-ray!  Looking forward to buying season 4 next year.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|We completely understand how Argo won the Oscar this year. This movie had everything and, having been based on truth, has that added element of realism.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is a great film for anyone who cares to see a story of God's love for human beings, although the theology is at times erroneous. For example, in the song near the end where Valjean sings, &#34;To love another person is to see the face of God.&#34;  This cannot be true without mention of faith, for even those who do not believe in Christ can love another person, but it does not follow that they will &#34;see the face of God&#34; simply because they, &#34;love another person.&#34;<br /><br />That being a necessary caution to just accepting the theology &#34;as is,&#34; what really stands out in the film adaptation of the play is how the grace of God still comes through in the mention of mercy, forgiveness and redemption. But God's grace is only available to those who hear of Christ's sacrificial death and rising from the dead.  A Christian would know what this is about.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is a great series and I am hoping to see the next season when it comes available on Prime!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Daft Punk have really outdone themselves this time. I can't wait to hear the rest of Random Access Memories.<br /><br />A+ 10/10 would buy again.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Good movie but don't watch it if you are tired. I fell asleep and had to watch the last 50 minutes again the next day.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is the first book I have read of Nicholas Sparks, but it won't be the last.  It had a good story line, great setting and character development.<br /><br />On an emotional level, I couldn't put it down.  The story kept me hooked from beginning to end.  I recommend it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It is impossible not to feel relaxed about 1 minute into the first song. It's like hanging out on a summer day with no agenda!
B003SI3URQ|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies ever... my kids enjoy it too...LOL! I never get tired of seeing it.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Loved getting to share an old favorite of mine with my kids. Good family fun. Will always love Julie Andrews
B0089LOG02|5.0|I didn't know anything about these trains. Heard an interview on NPR one day with the author and decided to give it a try, so glad I did. Great story based on history. Great writing, you can't help but care about these characters.
B007HACDLK|4.0|As an avid Mitch Rapp fan, I was disappointed by the previous two entries in the series. This book is a great effort in getting on track with the story line and showing what a badass Mitch Rapp is and what a great thriller espionage writer Vince Flynn is.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I really enjoyed reading about Cheryl's hiking the PCT, but for some reason, I didn't care reading about her personal life and I didn't like switching back and forth.  Towards the end of the book I skipped the parts about her personal life.  I would have given the hiking part of the book a 5 on its own.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Our book group read it and we all enjoyed the read.  We had a good discussion and some are motivated to go hiking on a two day trip.  Cheryl is amazing, I really like her and happy her life is in a good place!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best app it has decimals, percent,negatives and much more. I highly recommend this app. It is very easy and it also shows the previously typed equation
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Loved it  it made me laugh it made me cry and the oddness of the story plot kept my interest
0307950689|5.0|Just as good as Da Vinci Code! I have been reading it and thoroughly enjoying it. Robert Langdon is such an incredible main character and I'm glad Dan Brown has brought him back in this book... It's an incredibly interesting read and I would recommend it to all of my friends. I also enjoyed the American backdrop for the story, it's a new and interesting scenery. Great read!
B000784WMW|5.0|Timothy Dalton does a great job in this version of Jane Eyre.  The movie is well done and worth getting if you are a fan of Charlotte Bronte.
0740748475|5.0|Very high quality books.  I was surprised at how heavy they were!  I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys Calvin and Hobbes.
0761163808|2.0|Great reviews but this product falls way short of these accolades. Images are of poor quality to start with and the movement which triggers the motion effect is difficult for most young children to master. To tout this as breathtaking technology in this day and age is laughable.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl kept me in suspense until the end.  It had a real twist in the characters.  I thought I had it figured out and I didn't.  At times I wanted to say to the characters &#34; How can you believe each other?&#34;  A page turner and hard to put down.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A friend of mine who is retired from being a school librarian told me that this is one of her favorite books.  It is written for older children through adults.  Zusak writes so beautifully that I would now read anything by him.  The book has such an unusual narrative voice (I won't give that away, although it is evident from the beginning).  It is deep and sad, addressing the full gamut of humanities worst and best behaviors.  Well worth the read.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a mesmerizing account of a man's past as a child solider, and how he got to that point. Ishmael Beah is thrust into the chaos of war as he is going through a seemingly regular day. On the run from predators, rebels, and his own government whom makes even small children become soldiers. However when Ishmael comes upon a village taken by the government, he is told to leave or become a soldier. Ishmael refuses to leave behind the safety of the village, thus making him and all of his companion's child soldiers. Pumped full of drugs, Ishmael loses every last shred of his innocence and becomes the monster he once feared.<br />This novel shines because of the fact that Ishmael's story is true, and because of its vivid details. The novel also gives the readers an inside glimpse into the terrifying horrors of war. \\"An RPG had tossed his tiny body off the ground and he had landed on a tree stump.\\" If the reader thought this line was gruesome, then they better be prepared for more of this type of gruesomeness. Overall I really enjoyed the novel, it was eye opening and informative about issues around the world that we are uninformed about.<br />In my opinion, everyone should read this heart throbbing journey through Sierra Leone, because this novel tells of the true horrors of war, and prevents those who ever doubted that war is horrific and that it looks just like the movies. After reading the novel the reader will be distorted, your views on almost everything involving war will be altered. The reader will view war movies as being false, and feel more sympathetic to those whom are actually serving in the war on terrorism.<br />\\"The last casualty that we saw that evening was a woman who carried her baby on her back. Blood was running down her dress and dripping behind her, making a trail. Her child had been shot dead as she ran for her life. Luckily, for her, the bullet didn't go through the baby's body.\\"

0061950726|4.0|I promised myself I wouldn't cry. As I neared the last pages of Christina Baker Kline's novel, ORPHAN TRAIN, I could guess what had to happen. Any student of orphan train stories would bet that a popular author like Kline would craft a happy ending. I didn't know who or exactly what was coming round the bend, but I knew it had to be an upper. Sure enough, when I read the last pages, despite my firm resolve, I couldn't keep tears from rising.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a sucker for orphan train books, having written one myself: MAIL-ORDER KID: AN ORPHAN TRAIN RIDER'S STORY. I know the kind of research and perhaps even the amount of work Kline had to do to pull off the orphan train elements in her book. She created excellent believable tales of Niamh, a main character, and the strange families who took her in.<br /><br />But Kline steps out of her time period now and then. Little stuff. For instance, she has Niamh, wearing a pigtail in 1929 but pigtails weren't invented until 1951. She has a minor character, Mr. Post, saying, \\"See you in a jiff\\" in 1930. \\"Jiff\\" wasn't coined until 1943. It came out of the war.<br /><br />A more overt breech was a statement made by Mrs. Scatcherd, agent for the Children's Aid Society. She said to the children,\\"They call this an orphan train.\\" But they did not, not in 1929. That phrase was invented by two writers, Dorothea G. Petrie and James Magnuson, in their 1978 novel, ORPHAN TRAIN. The book became a highly successful TV show, and after that, the phrase, \\"orphan train,\\" entered our language.<br /><br />Mrs. Scatcherd shocked me even more when she prayed to \\"Mary, Mother of God,\\" asking for benevolence regarding the children. Mrs. Scatcherd, working for the Protestant Children's Aid Society, had to be a Protestant herself, and Protestants never pray to the Virgin Mary. Only Catholics.<br /><br />Picky, picky, picky. I know.<br /><br />If I were to review format, I'd be picky there, too. William Morrow put together a good-looking book. The paper, in particular, is delicious. A generous weight and the ragged edges make the pages a delight to handle, but the margins are much too narrow. Cutting costs, probably.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel. Kline caught me and drew me through her story, although I sometimes had to backtrack to remember who some of her many minor characters were. At other times, I had to flip pages to determine which of her two main characters I was reading about. You'd think it would be easy to distinguish between a ninety-one year old and a seventeen-year-old. And it is--when they're together in the same chapter. But Kline's chapters move back and forth in time, so sometimes the older woman is a teenager, too.<br /><br />I subscribe to Google Alerts, and receive orphan train items, usually daily. When Kline's book came out, the number of orphan train alerts I received skyrocketed. Most featured Kline's novel.<br /><br />This makes me extremely happy. For years, those of us clustered around the National Orphan Train Complex in Concordia, Kansas, have said to one another, \\"If only there were some way to publicize the Orphan Train movement so it would be received as an established part of American history.\\" Looks as though Kline is doing just that as reader after reader encounters the orphan train as they race through her novel and perhaps, if they're like me, cry a bit at the end.<br /><br />Christina Baker Kline, Orphan Train: A Novel<br />[[ASIN:0061950726 Orphan Train: A Novel]]<br /><br />Marilyn June Coffey, Mail-Order Kid<br />[[ASIN:0962631728 Mail-Order Kid: An Orphan Train Rider's Story]]<br /><br />National Orphan Train Complex at [...]The paper, in particular, is delicious.

B000JMKRKC|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish! It hooked me in the first chapter and I was intrigued by the plot. There was suspense at every chapter end too! I was happily surprised with the ending and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical mysteries!!
B00BI745AA|4.0|Really liked it.  Great actors, great story.  For a guy that would avoid a musical, I still liked this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just love this show!!! - It's done very well and then character dynamics are amazing!!! can't wait to tune in next season.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|This is no Raw Power, how could it be? These guys are in their late sixties, (except for the Departed) and the battles are just about over. Raw Power was a cry for love and more life while facing death and destruction during the Vietnam war era. It was brutal, youthful desperation and this album, forty years later is mainly foolishness.....but in a good way.<br /><br />We need more foolishness. When human beings are humorless and take themselves so serious that they can't laugh ...watch out. The cartoon figure on the cover of Ready to Die, with explosives strapped to his body, depicts such a person. A person that feels so out of touch, impotent and full of rage that they will destroy themselves and anybody else to be heard......that is a real danger.  Osterberg was pretty good at capturing some of this self-destructive motivation early on. It almost destroyed him but he chose life and his art. Here he is rocking on and putting on a pretty good show for an old man. This character that he created, Iggy Pop, has had a lot to say and he was one of the most dynamic and energetic performers ever. Those that saw him perform in his prime know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />This thing rocks and it's fun, especially if you've been an Iggy fan as long as I have.  A couple of good reflective ballads here as well. Williamson still plays a terrific lead, unique and powerful. Good loose sound over all, the sound of the Stooges.<br /><br />It's good to see and hear these old guys that still have it.  Guys like Ian Hunter, John Cale, David Bowie, Iggy, Lou Reed and of course Dylan and Leonard Cohen can still deliver art that's human. Dig it.....<br /><br />Changed this to five stars after listening to it for a week and comparing it to recent releases by other artists....love it.

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|After watching this movie, I was motivated to sell everything I own, quit my job, buy a one way ticket to Japan, show up on Jiro's doorstep armed only with my sushi knife and offer to work as his apprentice for free, sleeping in the kitchen and eating just enough food to keep from starving to death, even if it meant I would be massaging an octopus 12 hours a day. OK, maybe that was just a LITTLE overboard. But the movie certainly is inspiring.<br /><br />Without going into the bloody details, the movie is very insightful and informative. You should watch the movie once, then watch it again with the alternate soundtrack, then watch the extras paying particular attention to the section about the \\"Masters\\". Repeat as necessary.<br /><br />There are a couple of questions I would have liked for the movie to have answered:<br /><br />First, it was mentioned in the film that Jiro is left-handed. But never once did we see Jiro actually wield a yanagi-ba. He was shown eating with chopsticks, using his right hand. Knowing personally the difficulty of acquiring a good left-handed yanagi, especially on this side of the Pacific, I would have loved to have seen Jiro actually using one. If I was disappointed in any manner it was that this question went unanswered. I will have to settle for being able to sit back and be smug about the fact that the world's greatest sushi chef is a southpaw.<br /><br />Secondly, I wonder if Nakazawa ever got his own restaurant. And, no, I have not googled him to see.f Tokyo or Osaka alone and unarmed at night and living to tell about it, return to your OWN \\"culture\\" and do the same through the streets of Detroit or Memphis or any other large American city and see how you fare. Maybe this will attenuate your sense of self importance and political correctness just a bit.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I really loved the poetry of their lyrics and the message behind each rhyme. It is really a fascinating listen.
0865478007|4.0|This is one of those books that is set to polarize. And what you get from reading this will really depend upon your starting position.<br /><br />If you are 'pro Big Pharma' and focus on all the good things the industry has achieved over the years, you may well find the content very biased, selective and one sided, despite the authors best attempts at being open and transparent.<br /><br />If you are from the other side of the pharma fence then you may well find this almost unbelievable in the scope and scale of the issues exposed.<br /><br />I found the book a very compelling read. Yes, with a lot of data - almost too much for me to absorb, but certainly an over whelming argument. But, I think the title is an attention getter. What this showed me was that the healthcare sector really is in trouble. Bad Pharma is not solely to blame. Bad physicians. Bad researchers. Bad regulators. Bad scientific Societies. Bad Payers. They all play their part in making the system what it is today.<br /><br />What was missing for me was the role of Wall Street in particular, and the financial markets, in driving this behavior. What happened to Bad Wall Street?<br /><br />The writer did a good job of exposing the issues as well as trying to put forward some solutions. A nice change from merely castigating the perpetrators.<br /><br />If you have a role in healthcare you owe it to yourself to be well informed. And this book will certainly help you be better informed on some issues that have been 'undiscussable' in the past.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Three things it has that I like: it's English (as in British), it's a time-period series and it doesn't have any content that is too much for my girly-girl 7 yr old to watch it with me.  It's entertaining without cussing, sexual content or violence.  I don't usually shy away from those things exclusively but this was a perfect fit for me and my girl to cuddle up and watch.  I love Downton Abby but even that has content that I don't want to breech with my little one yet.  The acting can be a bit stilted at times but in general the main actors are great.  Give it a try!
0865479186|3.0|The book really sets the scene for book No 2 - Bad Pharma. It has a wider view of science and shows how poor judgement and reporting impacts scientific outcomes.<br /><br />Certainly there is a lot of data here, and it is not a book you are going to fly through and come out the other end with a complete understanding of the issues. At least if you are not a 'rocket scientist to begin with'. I had to work my way through some of the statistical analysis parts, which, by the way, are one of the keys to understanding the issues, and had to take my time to ensure I fully grasped the implications of the data presented.<br /><br />That's not to say this isn't a good read, just that it will make you think.<br /><br />Much of what is presented in this book finds its way into the follow up where the focus is sharper and perhaps more cutting. While it is not necessary to read this one before Bad Pharma it certainly sets the scene.<br /><br />Poor science, poor study design, poor analysis and very poor reporting all contribute to the problem. Credibility clearly is the looser and self interest the driver.
0517548232|5.0|If you read and understand this book (which isnt hard....no fancy terms or math equations) you will understand economics better than 99% of most economists.  I have bought this book as gifts for people (who probably hated me for getting them a book for a gift) because I truly consider it to be eye opening, maybe even life changing, for those who don't really think much about economics or don't get why we can't all just get everything we want
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This movie is awesome. Denzel Washington at his best. John Goodman is also awesome. Anyone who is a fan of these actors is going to love it. Not for anyone under 18.
B000274THQ|5.0|If you like the history of Eastern Countries and USSR. You will LOVE this movie. This movie captures those fascinating days and weeks as the Soviets loose control over East Germany. This demonstrates the affections some people had for their East German roots-- and how quickly things change..... highly recommend for anyone, it is funny and entertaining.

B009R659L8|5.0|i LOVE ALL OF MARY HIGGINS CLARK BOOKS.  IT IS EASY READING AND HER WRITING IS LIKE AN OLD FRIEND.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Imagine the scene:  A father has just accidentally intercepted a love note addressed to his only child, a daughter.  This letter reveals several facts:  The two have only met once.  She has given the young man a note confessing her love, and tell him she and her father are leaving the country.  The final fact?  The young man is currently involved in a rebellion against the government which he does not expect to survive.  Were this a scene in any other movie or TV drama I've ever seen except Les Miserables, this father would have surely said something like \\"Well, that's that, and she'd better get over him as quickly as she fell for him,\\" before destroying the letter.  But this scene is from Les Miserables, which means something far more surprising happens instead.  More than almost anything else, Les Mis as it is called in short form, is a story about the conflict between justice and mercy.<br /><br />It is called Les Miserables, of course, because it primarily focuses on the miserable people.  This is a story about the oppressed, downtrodden, from whom hope has been stolen.  Characters sing, yes, but about things like being a slave, or feeling as though they are standing in their graves.  The world of this musical is harsh and unforgiving.  Each character faces despair, but none so thoroughly as Fantine, who, according to Anne Hathaway who played her, is the most miserable.  We see her life as a terrible downslide, with no kindness shown to her till it is far too late.  But of course, she is not the only outstanding character, or actor in the film.  Les Mis is an extravagant production, led by the always impressive Hugh Jackman, and including some very well cast and talented newcomers to my knowledge.  The scene, costumes, and singing are all brilliantly done, and the special features nicely add to my appreciation of these elements.  They also made me want to go and read the original novel by Victor Hugo.  Every member of this production who spoke waxed eloquent onhow it was the true source of all this brilliance.<br /><br />They did not, however, talk about the unique method this filming of Les Miserables used for recording the singing, which I had heard about from other sources.  So as much as I recommend this movie, I also suggest getting whatever is the most deluxe edition available.  This is a movie for the ages, with perennial themes of justice, love, kindness, mercy, oppression, despair, crime, rebellion, and Hugh Jackman's incredible physical strength.  A true must-see, especially for the themes of grace and redemption.
082300659X|4.0|I am a guy who reads a lot of drawing books, probably because it is less painful than creating bad drawings.

B0033AI4PM|5.0|The wait for the bluray version of \\"Funny Girl\\" is finally over.  And it was well worth the wait.  The picture is crystal clear, and the audio is phenomenal.  The film is presented just as it was in 1968, where it toured the country in the \\"better\\" movie houses as a \\"Road Show Attraction\\".  In other words, you get the overture, the intermission, etc.  Just as if you were back at the premiere only enjoyed from the comfort of your media room.  There are no new extras, but who cares?  To have this incredible film in beyond mint condition, and to hear the orchestra, the musical numbers, and Barbra in a format never seen or heard before is more than enough for me.  Don't miss adding this classic to your collection.  I am just so happy!
B004JHYRDQ|4.0|Some aspects are a little dated (Asimov completely missed forecasting how some technology would advance), but it's still a great story.

[Just kidding on the equine and confectionery].<br />*<br />It's Fripp, with master musicians with whom he already has a working relationship, in 2013. This should not surprise nor disappoint anyone. It  exceeds. This is genuine modern music.

B00BUAFBW6|4.0|Edited 5 Jun 2013 to add that there is a World of thedas errata sheet (written by Brother Genitivi, of course) available now on the BioWare blog. I can't put a clickable URL in the review but it is located at<br />blog DOT bioware DOT com /2013/06/05/world-of-thedas-volume-1-an-errata<br /><br />I bought the Collector's Edition through Bioware as well as the regular hardcover from Amazon and both of those get four and a half out of five stars. Five for art and design, four for content and accuracy.  The Kindle version gets one star, for reasons enumerated in the last paragraph.<br /><br />For a book that Mike Laidlaw claims is \\"ruthlessly fact checked\\" it has a number of obvious errors, and John Green's review already covered many of them.<br /><br />Examples of a few timeline inconsistencies that John didn't cover:<br /><br />- [[ASIN:B0030V0PEM Dragon Age: The Calling]] covers the events of King Maric's return to the Deep Roads in the company of some Orlesian Grey Wardens including Duncan.  Someone editing the World of Thedas timeline got very confused and decided that the events at the end of The Calling took place in 9:10 and the ones that make up the bulk of the book took place in 9:14.<br /><br />- The timeline claims that Empress Celene was born in 9:6, but the body of the text says she became Empress at age 16 in 9:20.<br /><br />- Early in the timeline the Avvars split off from the Alamarri in -1815 Ancient and the Chasind split off and move into the Wilds in -1415. In 1:50 Divine they combine forces and Hafter holds them off, becoming the first teyrn in the Ferelden valley.  In 5:42 Exalted, the timeline says that Calenhad united Ferelden.  In the body of the text, on page 26, there's a description of human tribes that claims that Avvar and Chasind only split off because they resisted the unification of Ferelden under Calenhad.<br /><br />On the plus side, the book is absolutely gorgeous and it is really nice to have all of the information in one place and so well-organized. The lore isn't all brand-new stuff we didn't already know, but some of it is a really interesting look at parts of the world we would never get to see in-game: there's an interesting bit about the sexual mores of different cultures, a bunch of sidebars by various Thedosian personalities, lots of notes and letters, and quite a lot of detailed information.  The chapter on Thedosian races and the one on the various nations of Thedas are both excellent and do a great job of giving a more vibrant picture of life in Thedas.<br /><br />The Kindle version is essentially a low-res scan of the books I already paid over $100 for. It doesn't work on my Mac, doesn't work on my actual Kindle device, and doesn't work on my iPhone. It only works on the Kindle app on my iPad. The text is not searchable or selectable, and navigating the book uses the comic book interface of the Kindle app much like Dark Horse's own comic reader. Unlike the Dark Horse reader, I can't view parts of the book in significantly better detail by zooming: you get the full-page and the frame nav, and that's it. Given the choice between it and any other available format, choose the other format.so well-organized.

B0098VXE50|4.0|Charlize Theron was the star of this movie. I always find Kristen Stewart to be a bore to watch. She has almost no range of emotions. Obviously she is beautiful and looks like Snow White, but otherwise I didn't enjoy her performance. (Chris Hemsworth was an excellent addition though!)
B00BF123WG|4.0|The characters in this movie mumble and slur their words together (and some of it is in a foreign language, but it's often difficult to tell when).  Amazon's playback options (on computer nor Playstation, anyway) do not include subtitles/closed captioning, which is disappointing.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|What a wonderful movie, it was truly a pleasure to watch. However I was very disappointed in the ending. This movie went by very quickly but I was looking forward to seeing the dragon! It took my completely by surprise when it abruptly ended and I was fairly annoyed!

B002PNER9U|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I find it strangely comforting, must be the music! Would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals.
0800141660|5.0|This book is obviously a classic and this adaptation was done so well that I literally watch it all of the time. I felt that this movie captured the essence of the characters superbly well, which can be hard to do with such a classic and well loved story.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I Thoroughly enjoyed this book. As with Sanderson's other works this series is set in a unique and interesting world, with a comprehensive lore and backstory.<br />I recommend this book for anyone looking for their next high fantasy fix, now that WoT is officially finished..
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I tried 5 x to open it and every time it loaded it brought me back to my home screen. it stinks. I don't recommend it.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Good plot, good characters, great ideas.  Not well crafted nor smooth writing. Is she really writing her own material at present?
B004UID2LC|2.0|It's ok but sometimes it doesn't even let me into the app.And it takes forever to load.It doesn't let me watch everything I click on.One time it was still playing when I exited out and you could still hear it even when my kindle was off.Do me favor and DON'T GET THIS APP!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|this album is just amazing i bought it a few weeks ago and been listen to it every day since.i would highly recommend getting this cd it is worth the money no doubt.btw this album contains three cds combined makes over 2 hours of music.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I enjoy generational stories with settings in foreign lands.  Add a family mystery and you have the makings of an engrossing story.  I, also, liked the fairy tale structure used to ribbon the plot together.  The characters were an ensemble of varying personalities needed to construct the mystery.  It certainly kept my interest throughout the peeling of each layer.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Its long, but there's a reason this book is a classic.  It's a wonderful story and definitely worth taking the time to read.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Dear Michael,<br /><br />I've given 'To Be Loved' a fair shake over the last couple of days. I'd say it's more aptly named 'To Be Liked'. Unfortunately, for your sixth outing, there are definitely some major problems on this release. Michael, you seriously need to ditch Bob Rock and crew and find a better producer. That is, of course, assuming he made some of the awful production choices on this release which I assume that he did. How I 'To Be Liked' thee, let me count the ways.<br /><br />First (and most importantly), ditch the vocal correction and vocal processing. Bad choice. The first release I heard this introduced on was the recent holiday release. I gave that release some slack because it was, after all, just holiday music. With this release and as an artist, you do want us to take you seriously as a singer, right? Vocal correction has no place on an album with a singer who already has the vocal chops as you so aptly do. You've proven that on your five previous releases. That, and I've seen you sing live. Why add vocal correction now? Ditch it. It makes your voice sound higher pitch than it is and also makes it sound like you're singing through a drinking straw. Worse, when they applied it to Reese Witherspoon's vocals on 'Something Stupid', she sounds robotic. Is that even Reese? This is, in fact, the absolute worst sounding song I've ever heard released from you. Yes, it's even worse than the songs on that semi-bootlegged unofficial release called 'Totally Bubl&eacute;' that you hate so much.<br /><br />Second, what's up with the production quality? One of the first things you'll notice about the orchestra backing tracks on Hollywood, Crazy Love, Call Me Irresponsible and other releases is just how crystal clear the Bubl&eacute; band is. I mean, so clear are the horns on one side with strings on the other and the drums nestled perfectly in between. The stereo is gorgeous and when combined with your voice, it's nearly magic. With the opening track 'You Make Me Feel So Young' the backing track is muddy, lacking stereo separation, blaring with midrange, has an unnatural reverb which makes the whole orchestra seem almost mono (and in a bad way).  I was just waiting to hear that fake vinyl album crackling effect to at least tell me that someone intentionally recorded it this way. I don't know if this is a recording problem or an intentional mastering problem with the orchestra, but something went seriously wrong here. On top of that, there is your layered vocals with vocal correction. Definitely not a winning combination and definitely not the track I would have placed as the opening track had I been the producer. Thankfully, this odd orchestra recording weirdness doesn't proceed beyond the first track. But, it does set a bad tone as the introductory track.<br /><br />Third, what's with the song choices? While there are a few familiar standards on this one, there are none with the appeal of Call Me Irresponsible, Come Fly With Me, Summer Wind, Cry Me A River, All Of Me or I'm Beginning To See The Light (just to name a few). Seriously, those were some great song choices with amazing arrangements. The song choices on To Be Loved, questionable. There might be a few that could be thought of as okay, there are far fewer than I would have expected at this point in your career. There are many far better standards out there like 'You're The Top', 'Summer Me, Winter me', 'As Time Goes By', 'My Funny Valentine', 'You Wanna Bet', 'All The Things You Are',  'Blue Moon', 'Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home' and 'Come Rain or Come Shine' just to a name a few. I can hear you singing each and every one of these in my head and doing a great job of it (without vocal correction and your crystal clear band sound).<br /><br />Let's ditch the electronic vocals, the crass production effects and get to the roots of doin' it the old fashioned way. You know, just you, a microphone and the band recorded to perfection? We have a deal? Now, let's go makereal record.<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 stars (rounded to 3 because you can't do halvsies with Amazon).<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 stars (rounded to 3 because you can't do halvsies with Amazon)
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|Disney Studios have come out with another attempt to get something like a \\"Toy Story\\" franchise with this loud and colorful film for kids.  Even an old fuddy-duddy like me can still appreciate well told stories with animated characters as long as there are some jokes for the oldsters and a good musical score.<br /><br />Our hero is actually a \\"bad guy\\" named Ralph (John C. Reilly) who resides within the arcade game called Fix-It Felix Jr.  His job is to wreck an apartment while Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) repairs the destruction with his magic hammer.  Ralph is tired of being ostracized by Felix and the apartment's residents.  He is told that in order to fit in he needs to win a gold medal.<br /><br />Ralph decides he wants to be a \\"good guy\\" and goes to another game in search of the medal which he accidentally does win.  He is chastised however by the hero of that game, a warrior named Calhoun (Jane Lynch) because he allowed a small mechanical spider-like creature go with him to yet another game.  In this Candy Land game he meets a young girl named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) who is also shunned by others in the game because she is known as a glitch, which eventually could shut down the game for good.<br /><br />The story must resolve itself as Felix, Calhoun, Vanellope and Ralph work to correct a wrong perpetrated by King Candy (Alan Tudyk).  Oh and destroy the spider-thingies who have grown and multiplied.  The film looks great on Blu ray 1080p and has a thunderous DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 sound option.  As far as the jokes and music?  Nothing special, although I admit that some of the jokes involving the arcade games sailed over my head.  The conclusion of the movie was very good but it took a while to get rolling.  I suspect that the younger viewers will enjoy the movie without reservation.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|They are back - after a 7 year hiatus and this song meets every single expectation and more.  Any Daft Punk fan must add this to their collection.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper, along with Kate Morton's 3 other novels that I have read, did not disappoint. It was a great read. Characters, content, descriptive and captivating page turner. Loved all her books. Looking forward to her next.
B00000K3D4|2.0|Too many places where the dvd skips. We can get through it but it's painful.  I will be less eager to order used dvds.
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|I bought this because the vinyl looked cool and there was a lot of hype. I'd never heard this soundtrack before. I got it yesterday and played it just for the hell of it. I would describe it as 50% Pink Floyd DSOTM and 50% Wet Dream (Richard Wright). Its really cool and doesn't use too much sampling from the movie.<br /><br />The vinyl is the coolest red vinyl I've seen and there wasn't one click or crackle.<br /><br />I'm very pleasantly surprised by this release. I do like the movie too. Saw it in the theater when it came out and I have the 5 blu-ray disk collection.<br /><br />My wife even asked me, \\"What is this music?\\" She agreed that it was actually worth the $$.<br /><br />Now I REALLY want to have one of the \\"biscuits\\"!!! Name your price.<br /><br />I think there is going to be a SCAD too.
B004529NKC|4.0|My 7 yr old and I love this movie. We were renting it o much we had to buy it. The step up movie that are directed by Jon Chu are the best ones. I started on Step Up 3 and then was introduced to the others. I like the element if surprise that was mixed into the choreography. I loved Twitch on So You Think You Can Dance. Adam Sevani, on looks alone and never watching any other movie he might be in, took me by total surprise every time. This is by far the best of the sequels.
