B00FEN1C50|4.0|Good popcorn action flix. Liked the main actors. Special effects were awesome. A lot better than I thought it would be.
B004UID2LC|1.0|i have a Samsung S 4 . i downloaded this app. right away it caused my phone to slow up and lock up... i deleted it
B007FEFLTO|3.0|It got slow and talk and I couldn't wait to get done! It was a snooze fest after while so there
B0000A5BT1|1.0|I did not get this and it was very disappointed that they could not deliver this to me as I wanted
6305428042|5.0|This is such a great movie. I enjoyed it as a kid and now my kids do as well! This is a must-have in your collection.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Don't ask me again to ever review a book this is a waste trying to get off this page you leave no choice
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is quite simple, but it's very addictive!! I just can't seem to put it down. I love it!!!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This story was different than anything I've read before.  I liked how the story evolved but I didn't get hoe the Megan story line ended.  There were so many better paths that could have taken.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My toddler loves this game, as does my wife and my tween. Great game for Kindle Free Time. Has no adds so my daughter hardly ever accidentally exits the game. Intuitive controls and unlimited fun.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the photos you take are not saved.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Just get the app trust me, I have played it everyday since I got it. You don't have to spend real money to advance and get cool stuff which is one reason I delete most pay apps. This one has it all, awesome dinosaurs, tons of extras to give your park a customized look, and best part u don't need to spend money to play and advance. One of the best apps I've ever downloaded
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Now I know what a true Hero does in war. What a stud. He will be missed. God bless him
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I really enjoyed this story.  Suggest you go to You Tube and see Jim and Bob on the streets of London
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Action filled, great story line. I highly recommend this movie to all Western buffs.  Can't go wrong with this one.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Overall a great game. I've had tons of fun with it and would recommend it. However there should be more options to customize a deck. Also, microtransactions in a $10 game? Really? Even with the ability to unlock them by playing, either make it a free app or leave them out.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is a cute, fun app with easy-to-move characters.  I have played this a long time, it's a great app.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Perfect for my son , 8 yrs old! But i am looking forward to seeing his face again without a computer attached.
0061969664|4.0|I have read all of the Saxon Tales and The Grail Quest series along with the stand along books 1356 and Stonehenge. I find that the history behind the stories are detailed and accurate. I appreciate the research that is done when writing the books. I look forward to the release of The Pagan King.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After decades and thousands of pages, the end of the saga.  I think it is a greater story than The Lord of the Rings, certainly longer.  Keeping track of the characters and story lines is almost as hard as reading a Russian novel but definitely worth the effort.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book will (or should) frighten you about how close we have come to a serious nuclear accident.  Very well researched and reported.
044024367X|1.0|I bought this book used.  Thank heavens.  Irritatingly bad.  I am working my way through all of the Reacher series and have read books written before this and after it.  This one is a stinker.  Hope the rest that I haven't read aren't.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This LCD support worked perfectly for me. It allowed me to clear my work-desk for several other items. Very nicely constructed.
B008133MDK|5.0|Best Sherlock Holmes series yet. Lots of twists and turns. Not the usual predictable writing of most of today's TV shows. Just wish there were about 6 more episodes per season!
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|I am only one in 1000's of folks who have expressed their appreciation for this prime example of Hitchcock's work. Bernard Herrmann's score and Cary Grant's charm/wit combine in an unparalleled entertainment experience.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. Liane Moriarty does a wonderful job developing her characters, people we can all relate to. This story offers drama and mystery keeping the reader engaged and intrigued. I look forward to reading her other works.
B00871C09S|5.0|Rear Window is yet another great work of art by Alfred Hitchcock. Jimmy Stewart is at his best and Grace Kelly is at her peak. No one who appreciates films of this genre will be disappointed. Spectacular entertainment.
B0044CG71G|5.0|Maybe the only boon to arriving late to FRINGE is that there won't be that interminable wait in between seasons. I guess, also, there's no fretting about whether the show'll get canceled or not. In recent weeks I'd been tearing thru the series, heaps of episodes at a time, losing sleep, underperforming at work, sometimes cursing the show for being so crazy good. Season 3 is the best one yet. The closing moments of its final episode (\\"The Day We Died\\") has me super-stoked to start watching Season 4. Except there's that damn thing called a job. And sleep. Do I regret not having glommed on to FRINGE when it was originally airing? Hell, yes.<br /><br />I admire the showrunners for being ambitious and for steering the overarching narrative into a bold new direction. I understand that the ratings were always a shaky thing for the show and that maybe the smart thing would've been to stick to the vanilla that people were expecting. As it were, Season 3 took a gamble. It still focused most on the Fringe divison \\"over here,\\" except that, every now and then, we got to visit the alternate Fringe division \\"over there.\\" You never could settle into mere monotony with this show. There was always something new and unexpected just around the corner. Massive props to the dynamic cast's performances. Most of them had to juggle dual parts, and it's a marvel that their doppelganger roles came across as distinct and equally sympathetic.<br /><br />I agree with John Noble's mom; the man so deserved an Emmy! Walter, Walternate, past Walter, past Walternate, futuristic even more buggy Walter, futuristic even more menacing Walternate. Noble was simply unbelievable and pushed so many emotional buttons. Admittedly, it took me a bit to warm to Anna Torv, but I'm all in now. This season, she takes on not only two roles but, deep into the season, a third one, as well. That her third iteration doesn't work as well is probably due more to the pointlessness and gimmicky nature of the William Bell story arc. That arc was a waste of a Leonard Nimoy. Still, \\"Lysergic Acid Diethylamide\\" deserves props for trying something different.<br /><br />And then there's maybe the season's most jawdropping scene: Broyles on LSD.<br /><br />Gratifyingly, the dying parallel Earth was explored in depth. Early on, episodes like \\"The Plateau\\" and \\"Amber 31422\\" delivered insights into what that world was really like and the desperate people who inhabit it. The first eight episodes (culminating with \\"Entrada\\") comprehensively built on the show's mythology. Subsequent episodes - the middle bits of the season - did slow down the mythology-building. But the final five episodes - and, yes, that includes \\"Lysergic Acid Diethylamide\\" - whipped the pace back to a frenzy. And then the awesome \\"The Day We Died\\" reshuffled things yet again.<br /><br />If nothing else, FRINGE has contributed to pop culture in a big way. Credit Walter Bishop for coining a slew of memorable words, from \\"Walternate\\" to \\"Fauxlivia\\" to \\"Vagenda.\\" But FRINGE is so much more than words cutely cobbled together. I haven't yet seen the full series but my friends who'd watched the entirety of it assure me that the show never sold out and that it never pandered. Always grounding them themes of insane technology and radicalism and dystopianism and crazy time paradoxes are those strong character beats that invest the viewer. The characters resonate with me. I care about Walter with his kind but mad eyes and buttoned-down Olivia and Peter, him what should never have existed. I haven't mentioned Joshua Jackson until now and how he's done this season. He's done very well. In a way, more than anyone else, he anchors the show. And this season revolves so heavily around him. Even more than Olivia Dunham, he's our point-of-view character. And Joshua Jackson is as good as anyone else here. so now can we have a retroactive vote to save the show? Because I am all in.ry arc. That arc was a waste of a Leonard Nimoy.

B0035JRUZQ|5.0|action with humor.  not too serious.  reminds me of the old movies I watched in the theater when they were new.
B009GFEOY8|5.0|I ordered the film for my new Polaroid camera and this was great film to start off with. It even arrived earlier then stated. Great buy for all seeking to get into Polaroids.
0061950726|3.0|Subject matter was very interesting, but writing was very simplistic. It was written at a YA level but some of subject matter might be a little difficult for very young readers. I found the characters in the present day story line to be flat stereotypes and preferred the Vivian story line.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's an awesome game, sure it's not the same as x box or computer, but the updates are coming. The only thing that really bugs me is the size of our worlds. Their so puny! I think our worlds should be at least twice Their size
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app works just fine. First you download it into your Android and then whatever books you wish. Thousands to buy or for free. It will place a Icon Android for Kindle into your tablet. After you sign into it using your Amazon sign in it is just one click after that to get into and read a book.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I will recommend to anyone. Recently started playing and I am really enjoying it Time consuming and challenging at the same time.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Gripping! Great pilot and looking forward to the rest of the series. I didn't believe all the hype so I'm glad I tried it out.
B00594XOZU|2.0|Its good after a while then it stop working. Its messed up and if i was u i would log out of it or it will stop working
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is very fun to play.....but the fact that you have to slide your finger to move the player is kinda hard for younger kids of age 5-6.
B003Z0BWR2|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the series, the relationship between jace and clary kept me enthralled  as well as the many other relationship dynamics.<br />Gripping , couldn't put it down!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it needs more stuff like minecarts, gamemodes, pistons, tracks, and a lot more items that could be useful and fun to play.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Part police procedural, part old-fashioned whodunit, with just enough philosophizing. Several well-rounded characters that already feel like old friends. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This was a book that I had a hard time putting down. I finished it in about 24 hours. I was drawn in by the plot mostly because I could see myself as the Mae character with just a little nudging. I think some reactions were taken to an extreme, but I think that was used to illustrate a point. I think this book has opened my eyes to some of my own social media participation and I will now think even harder about what I choose to share with the world. I'll also be keeping an eye on organizations that want to share my information.<br />The one thing that stuck with me is that we should have the option to opt-in or opt-out as we please. It shouldn't be mandatory to participate.<br /><br />Some of the characters were flat for me and I think some situation escalated much quicker than they would have in real life, but I think this book should be read by anyone that participates with social media. Just to give them a little voice in their heads that asks, \\"Is it really necessary for everyone to know that?\\".
1476727651|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out and I wasn't disappointed.  First, I have to say the cover art is genius even though I know Mr. King didn't do it.  Totally creepy yet beautiful at the same time and fits the book perfectly.  And then - holy cats!  I'll never feel the same about those clusters of RV's in the Walmart parking lot again.  Or their polyester clad occupants!<br /><br />I loved this book and took my time with it until I was about three-quarters of the way through and then I picked up the pace simply because it was giving me nightmares!  There is something so subtle about Mr. King's writing that just gives me the creeps.  Excellent story line and tie-in to The Shining but it also stands alone if you've never read that book.  I donated my copy to the local library when I was done because I told my husband I wanted it out of the house!  Devil book!  Loved, loved, loved it!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Will admit to being a big fan of Mayer's music and songwriting.  For me, this is yet another great addition to the collection of fine albums he has put out.  Really enjoyable album.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|This clock app is a very versatile and useful app. I was disappointed though that by not keeping my Kindle plugged in one night I had NO power the next morning. Even after I plugged the Kindle in it took at least 5+ minutes for the battery to have enough power to run my apps, etc. I would not recommend this app unless you're prepared to keep your Kiindle plugged in overnight each night.
B001H9MYPW|3.0|I received the dvds in a strange arranagement: 3  single dvd-cases with 2 dvds each, one dvd separately. four papersleeves added
B005HEVBGG|5.0|I loved the character development in this Star Trek series.  The flaws, fears, expectations, conflict...A great way to advance or build on what Gene Rodenberry began to envision.  I watched every episode in first run, so I'm thrilled to be able to stream this via Amazon Prime.  Great series with a fantastic ending.  I can't wait to relive this video journey.
B005UG542S|5.0|This is a great depiction of the book. The actors have grown with the movie series and I am going to miss them a lot!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|After all the hype about the books and this movie, I was mildly disappointed - I guess I had been expecting more - oh well!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Very fun seeing these two in a movie together.  Neat special effects and great story line.  Liked the ending as well!
B005QYKD4I|4.0|A lot of fun to watch and quite entertaining. Worthwhile watching and  a lot better than what is on TV these days......
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Really, with these actors, no words are really needed. It looked like they were having a lot of fun making this as well.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I enjoy these puzzles so much. My daughter and I play this together and its a blast. I would like the bigger pieces puzzle to be free though. I like how you can choose the difficulty of the puzzle. All in all, Great app.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I had not heard of this movie and i happened upon it and decided to try it.  it was great!  Neat plot and great actors.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|excellent picture quailty and sound.The best remastering ever seen. Just like I was back in 1966. Love the episode with the Klingons
B006QKKICS|1.0|The movie is slow to start and rather mundane compared to the previous Hostel movies. Group of friends go to Vegas to have a bachelor party and they get caught by an elite hunting club.  The tortures seem more impersonal than in previous movies.  The group bids on the victim but the winner doesn't take any sort of \\"hands on\\" approach to killing/torturing the victim.  Also, the torture parts are extremely tame compared to the first Hostel.  One guy gets his face cut off with a scalpel (all the guy does is cut a circle and pull flesh...lame), another involves a girl getting sprayed with a sweet liquid and then roaches crawl on her and in her mouth and another guy gets shot by arrows.  The ending was predictable and the motive for his friend's betrayal pathetically weak.  The movie bites and if you enjoy the franchise then stop watching after Hostel 2.  The first Hostel was more enjoyable and the second was watchable, the third is just an insult.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Belonging to a class of moral decisions this was our first book and I joined the night before with no book BUT Amazon Kindle had it and within  few minutes I had it.  Then the fun began  - thought it was a woman's book but it isn't what you think and THINK you had to do with her twisting and turning plot she ensnares you into her world and leaves your fingers numb from reading so fast that you must go back and gather all the clues you left behind.  Beautifully written, well developed characters  and so many unexpected twists and turns that on the last page you turn the book to page one and start again.  Is 5 stars justifiable NO  10 would be better.  One of the best books I read in 10 years.  Thank you Kate.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|I thought the pacing of the movie was rather slow.  The acting was ok but I wasn't impressed by it.  I don't even understand why the detective was helping because it seems like the author could have googled the information.  The whole idea of the bad guy \\"living\\" in the film was done a lot better in other movies.  Also, when a demon is mentioned I expect it to look a wee bit evil; however, this demon looks like a grungy human in a Halloween mask.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I did not find a calculator on my Kindle Fire, so I downloaded this and it is very simple to work and the large buttons are easy to read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My granddaughter forced me to read this book it's not my usual mystery, cop novel. Since we  frequently read and do her homework together and she had read the book she decided I needed to check it out. Since she loved it she badgered me until I committed to reading it. Anyway I read the book she watched over my progress because it creates such strong emotions that I just had to set it down every so often to regain myself. It's the story of young people, love and death and how these are shared. It's really well done and quite beautiful. I thanked her for bringing it to me, sharing her feelings  and making me more human. At 71 I relived a little of the emotions of youth and discovered they are not so different at any age.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|yes it works, and it works for emulators, icade mode, keyboard mode,..<br />small and compact,,, GOOD PRICED<br />but, this is the same as IPEGA gamepad,,, same garbage.<br />very very bad direction pad,  it will hurt your hand, and lose your game..<br />the direction button are garbage.... all 3 of them,<br /><br />it has the R1 and R2 button, but they are pretty useless, they are very small and cannot precisely pressed,,,,<br /><br />at least, this one is LITTLE bit better than the ipega... YES, $3 better.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I bought this for my dad for his birthday. he loved it, I loved it, everyone loved it. then again I do live in a zombie fan household....so it comes as no surprise that we loved this zombie, romantic, comedy movie. it had something for everyone to enjoy. :)
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great service and a great price for another amazing cd from amazon. the holidays are coming and i plan to do major shopping on amazon this year. JT is still making great songs. hooray for me!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|No more having to connect up an HDMI cable or something else irritating. I love how convenient it is just being able to select whatever content I want and have it switch over instantly. I can't wait for more applications to support it.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I knew I would find this cd on amazon for a reasonable price. hooray for me! It arrived quickly and in good shape, she is one of those singers whose voice you recognize quickly and my sister and I couldn't wait to get her new cd! We hope she has a long career! Thanks amazon for  your great deals and delivery.<br />JW
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy the small challenges in this game. It is not to hard but still a chance as violence to find all the parts to fit as nd works the puzzles. Can't wait for new ones to arrive.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|This band has the sound that makes them unique and interesting. I listened to it for a week straight because I liked it so much.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great. And it is so funny I laughed so much that I my side's ached.I love it.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I know that Piper Kerman is not a professional writer, but during the book I never felt that I was &#34;walking in her shoes&#34; during her carceration. She did an above job describing the other characters in the book, but not herself. Lem Eldridge in El Salvador......
B005723JSQ|4.0|The story is a bit of a mess, but it's cute and fun. Hope Kinsella's next books are more like this and less like 20s girl.
B002TRL87Q|5.0|Another outstanding efford by perhaps the premier blues rock guitarist/singer<br />Of today. As usual guitar playing is flawless and the singing is outstanding . The bonus tracks give different perspective  to song and reinforces the skill of so g writing
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I'm a Whedon fan and a Shakespeare fan.  This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, and I loved watching a bunch of \\"Whedon Regulars\\" have fun with it.  I think the B&W filming worked to minimize any distraction from the modernized setting.<br /><br />As with other Shakespeare plays, I highly recommend reading the play before watching since the language is different from what we're used to with modern English as well as the fact that these lines are delivered rapid-fire, especially the jabs between Benedick & Beatrice.  You need to be prepared for the witty back & forth or you'll miss a lot of the innuendo, allusions, and word-play and almost every joke.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was excellent sad and very emotional. My ten year old loved it.I loved it. Loved it more than any other book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie was great for our family.  Entertaining for children and adults alike. Love how they tie it in to Hulk and Thor and Iron Man prior movies.
B00000FCBC|4.0|I think this double album will split Metallica fans into their 2 camps: those who love pre Black Album Metallica will love disc 2 and will probably give disc 1 only a couple of listens, and those who prefer post Black Album Metallica, who will love disc one and maybe find disc 2 not to their tastes.  I fall into the first camp.  I am a huge fan of early Metallica albums but lost interest after the Black album, and in my opinion disc 1 continues their drift into country influenced rock and roll, which is not my scene at all.  Disc 2 however, is absolutely brilliant!  Not only are the songs totally rocking, you forget they are cover songs and would be forgiven for thinking they were Metallica originals.  This goes to show how heavily influenced the band was by NWOBHM music, and a listen to the original versions of the songs reveals that a large part of what you thought was Metallica's sound isn't theirs at all!  Having said that, they really put their stamp on each song, making the guitars more rigid and the vocals more aggressive, and, well, more Metallica-y.  No matter which era of Metallica you prefer, there is a disc for you.
B00EEN7CAK|5.0|Great movie, I enjoyed it.
B0067TQQI8|1.0|I want to say a couple of things about the Anker Astro2 I purchased.  I bought the first one for a friend of mine and it has worked great!  I decided to buy another one for myself since it has proven to charge fast and for a long time.  When I received my second Anker Astro 2 charger it worked great for 3 weeks and that when it let me down.  Both ports for the usb connections stopped working.  I thought that it was the cords that did not work until I plugged them into my computer, where they worked fine.  The unit still charges fully but I also saw another problem.  It would show 4 fully charged light then after you unplug the unit from the power cord, it would only show one blue light.  Then it stopped working altogether.  It let me down and I am not happy.  I cant understand why the one unit still works and this one does not.  I would not recommend purchasing this product again.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|The action and story line was very well presented. I would recommend this movie for any one's personnel video library.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Rest in peace, Tom Clancy. You wrote books so big they could be used as house bricks in an emergency. Your plots were so complex they needed alternate universes to make sense. Your Jack Ryan is one of America's favorite characters, because he represents the truth, justice, and American way that they strive for. You named one of your books \\"Red Rabbit\\", which was brave, to say the least... You changed the face of thrillers, of techno-fiction, of spy novels. You were inseparable from the words \\"New York Times Bestseller\\", but you never lost your human touch.<br /><br />Not all your books were great, and some were downright snorefestive, but we will never forget your successes: The Hunt for Red October, Clear and Present Danger, and more. Alec Baldwin owes you a debt too, and we're sorry for that Ben Affleck movie...<br /><br />You died too soon, so once again I say, rest in peace. I now turn to John le Carre to fill your empty hole, but I know the page count is too thick for it to be filled up...<br />Once more, we miss you, Tom.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I found the movie to be cute. The other aspect  of the movie I enjoyed was the fact that the producers didn't make the movie beyond the viewing entertainment for the family.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is very good when it comes to third graders thru eighth grader but after it is immature and before it can cause your child to take bad actions
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I remember reading as a kid in elementary school. It has ended up on a list of life changing books. It has an increbile way of making you think about things in life in a whole new light. It is a must read for everyone.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|Interesting concept.<br />Totally believable and twist that was totally worth the wait.<br />The more you understand about the characters the more strange it gets.<br /><br />Nice read
B00BE97ONM|4.0|I have always been a fan of serial killer books and movies. After reading and watching so many, a lot of them begin to seem the same. This book seemed different though. It was told through multiple points of view, although the main character is Ben. And Ben fears he is losing his mind, and he is turning into a monster. Part of me really sympathized with him even though I didn't want to.<br /><br />This was an intriguing story that didn't hold anything back. The characters really seemed to come alive; there were ones that you really love to hate (Ben's girlfriend, Natalie, was at the top of my list). There were no perfect people in this book; even the main detective had some flaws. It definitely added some realism to this gritty story.<br /><br />The plot moves at a fast pace, and there are quite a few twists that will keep you guessing and wondering how this is going to pan out. It was really an enjoyable read. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to read a very good and very twisted thriller!
B0008ENIAC|5.0|ive seen this movie a few times on tv and its not enough, so i decided to buy it. thanks for having it
B00149C8BK|5.0|I love his music!! Always have! It helps me study! The beat helps me focus on what I need to focus on.
B00B52F278|5.0|i loved watching this series on tv, but i have already collected seasons 1 and 2, so i just made sense. thanks for having it
B001O4XWJM|4.0|A western with all the trimmings including details of life during the time period.  Accomplished actors deliver a well written screenplay that remains true to the novel.  The characters include unexpected complexity, such as Cole's desire to expand his education and vocabulary although he defaults to the more educated Hitch to fill in the blanks.  Much the same occurs as Cole takes the lead in the gun work, with Hitch providing able backing for his lawman partner.  It is a classic depiction of lead and sidekick, with an odd romantic relationship between the awkward Cole and the conniving Allison French.<br />There is enough action to please viewers, along with plot twists to bring the story to an rather unpredictable conclusion.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|loved hearing her music in the background of wimbelton this year. had to have it, so i looked it up and there it was. thank you
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Works great. I have used the alarm when i was on vacation. I like being able to check the weather .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Especially if you re-read The Shining.  Great to follow Danny into a complex adulthood. Character and story, classic Stephen King.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|If you read it (or have already read it), you'll appreciate the irony of my posting this recommendation on FB. . .
B000IJ79WU|3.0|This film was an interesting re-do, but personally I prefer the original release. The sound track is not synchronized well with the movie.
1475143389|5.0|The author gives direct, no-nonsese advice. His advice is based in tons of research and years of experience. He's not pushing product or supplements, in fact following his advice will save you money you probably would have wasted on garbage being pushed by the bodybuilder mags and websites.<br /><br />One minor complaint, would be better editing and organization. The information is in there, but it may take a couple of readings to find it. I highlighted key points and made notes/questions in the margins.  I really like the special download of a year-long program and additional recipes that the author provides<br /><br />The author has a very informational website muscleforlife.com and you can download chapters of some of his other books. I especially appreciate the email from Mike Matthew asking if I had any questions. To my surprise, he replied - not once but twice.<br /><br />If you're like me and are tired of the confusion and miss-information when it comes to building muscle and getting lean. Get this book
B005B0QYMM|5.0|I wasn't expecting very much from this movie, but it turned out to a real find. This a genuinely scary flick. One of my new favorites.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I'm just starting to discover games like this, and this is my second by Big Fish.  Really enjoy the mystery of it all, and glad for the hints because I don't think I would figure it out otherwise! Can't wait to do part 2!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love hidden object games and puzzles. This is a really interesting game actually quite good! It plays well. So in short if you like to unwind and finding hidden objects a doing puzzels I think you will love this game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series, and I was happy Amazon offered it so I could catch up before the next season. Interesting to watch how the 1% lived a hundred years ago.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season finale was jawdropping. Such rivoting stories and fantastic characters. Love this show. Cannot wait till Season 4. Victoria is hysterical.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is the greatest movie series ever produced.  I enjoyed each and every movie.  Any Star Trek fan is not sincere if they don't have this series in their collection.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|When I first saw &#34;TDKR,&#34; I didn't like it as much as &#34;TDK,&#34; having just seen that again and with Heath Ledger's great performance in mind.<br /><br />But &#34;Rises&#34; has so much going for it and it pulls everything in the trilogy together to a wonderful, fulfilling conclusion.  Now I'm looking forward to enjoying the extras.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I can't believe I am finally learning Spanish! It is so fun a child could do it and it is free! I am telling all my senior friends about Duolingo!
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|The movie, CASINO, is a cinematic-ally disturbing and a visually haunting look at the Las Vegas gaming industry's development, evolution, temporary implosion, and lucrative expansion....through the eyes of the hardened gangsters and shady wise guys who were there and who rode an incredible  multimillion dollar empire right down into the dry and light tan Nevada ground.<br /><br />Plus, the cast for this movie was chosen very well. Joe Pesci's persona just kidnaps the screen and holds your movie-going heart captive every time the camera's on him and Robert Deniro just gives another absolutely brilliant performance once again.<br /><br />CASINO, as a whole though, pulls no punches. It is not for the weak of heart or for those who still hold onto a DISNEY-fied love affair or who have bought into the advertised marketing perception of Las Vegas' wonderful gaming and vacationing attractions. No. CASINO, the movie, brutally highlights how Las Vegas is not some glitzy resort and calming get away adventure, in the middle of the the hot desert, for the average tourist's pleasure. No. CASINO really and truthfully shines a white hot spotlight on all of the greed, corruption, murder,lust, betrayal,dishonesty, ruthlessness and vice that went into the very lucrative gaming industry.<br /><br />CASINO entraps you, teases you, educates you, exhilarates you, seduces you, excites you, shocks you, and eventually drains you just like the exotic and never-ending Las Vegas nightlife.<br /><br />This is truly an epic tale that is absolutely worth your time to see.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|I liked it. It's pure escapist entertainment. I think Yul Brynner did a great job. How he walked around without blinking his eyes at all shows how into his role he was.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This show is so good. It's entertaining and graphic and extremely addictive. We sat down and watched the whole season the same day. And when it was over we were stunned. This is an out of the ordinary amazing program. Not for the week of heart or easily offended.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|It's been a long time since I saw this movie - and I still really like it. It reminds me of a combination of Brave New World and 1984.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This show is amazingly addictive. If you don't have time to sit down and watch it through completely you are going to be sorry. Literally could not stop watching it. So so good. Now waiting for season 3 to come out on DVD.<br />Got to run, off to watch it again, enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just love the books. Am just completing book 2 and will get book 3 soon.  easy reading made it great
0439023513|5.0|I ordered this book to replace one that my daughter lost. It arrived in excellent condition and I am happy to have a full set again.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Got this for my wife!  She loves this band.  Very American!  Her favorite band.  I like their music too!  Hope they keep it up!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|love this game it is so much fun.can't waitvto play it every day. I like that you can play it thrum fb
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you've always wanted to know what happened to Danny after leaving Colorado the wait is over. Enjoy the ride, I did.
B0058VW36U|5.0|If you like cute little animals then you will love this app.there is a cute animal that you have to try to go the sweets in his mouth.wen my cat sees it she gos crazy she is so cute.even noing it costs money you should still get it. it is so fun.  I cannot get past the 2 level but it does not matter. it is still fun.I think it should cost 100 dollars because it is so fun.I think everybody should get it because its so fun.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I've tried a few different number puzzles and this is the best! Simple to use, I will be purchasing more from this developer.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved the characters and the twists and turns the story took. This was as good as What Alice Forgot. Can't wait to read more of this author's books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great app!PROS:Has amazing graphics,fun for everyone,you can play with friends.CONS:My only con is that it needs some updates so you don't have an outdated client but that's all I have to say!Great app!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Some items are really hard to find. Zooming into the picture is key. Wish the energy would either refill faster, or be less per stage. All in all very fun to play.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is pretty much worth it because  it cost way less than the PC version. Plus, they have updates more frequently. But if there were more things in the next update like boats, bigger worlds, villagers, villages,rec. It would be much much better. I hope they do these things in the next update or two. If they keep making Minecraft PE grow. It could be almost like the PC. They just need to add more things like the PC version.  I could understand why the updates are more frequent than PC. Overall, with all the updates and all the stuff they are and will add, this is a very good deal and app.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app helps me wake up for school in the moning ,and so I can pick up a kindergartners in the moning.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Awesome game! Would be nice if not so much energy was needed on some rooms. Was happy to see free game continue for so long.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|There is no mistaking that this is DT, but it is IMHO the best version yet.  When &#34;A Dramatic Turn...&#34; came out it just felt like they were trying to hard to show their individual skills as great musicians, as if they were trying to make up for the hole that Portnoy left.  In doing so, I don't think they allowed Mike Mangini to play his best.<br /><br />With this new album (that's still acceptable right?), the band seems to be a much more cohesive unit than I ever remember them being in the past.  All five instruments (I consider James' vocals to be the fifth) are individually spectacular but seem to be an even greater sum of their parts.<br /><br />Every song at some point makes me stop and think &#34;man, that was cool&#34;.  I just don't think this album could have ever been made if Portnoy was still with the band.  You can just feel them all being more comfortable in their expanded roles much more so than before.  We all know Petrucci is a beast but his tone and playing have taken on new levels.<br /><br />In the past, some of their longer songs just gave me tired head at times, but when I know I am going to be in the car for 20 minutes without interruption I go directly to the last track and enjoy every second.<br /><br />I can't say it enough that I think this is their best yet.  I hope you buy it and feel the same.
B00ESF285S|5.0|I Love this book!  Dr. Suess is a master at simplifying life's worries, breaking patterns with humor and leaving us in a great state.  I love his books and this one is one of my favorites.
B00EDOS6IC|3.0|I really like AB but this new one is a little bit of a let down.  Just feels like more of the same.  Not saying it is bad by any means, just nothing that made me stop and say &#34;I Love It!&#34;.  In all honesty, it took me 3 passes to get through the entire disc from start to finish.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This app is great when WiFi is not available. It keeps me busy when I have waiting to do and the kids can do it also.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Was a good movie for a cool, rainy Saturday evening.  A little predictable but had a couple interesting twists in it.
B004FN1QNI|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book. By far my favorite in the Wallflower series. I read it in one day!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Excellent Book  had me in tears at the end.Every  American should read this boob about our brave fighting Heros Awesome
B003TTCURU|5.0|Great show I watch it like almost everyday after school. I just love to watch doctors do surgeries in every episode
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I just have to say I'm hooked.  A friend turned me onto Lorde a couple of weeks ago and now I can't stop listening.<br /><br />Her voice sometimes reminds me of a female Mike Posner, I would actually love to hear them do a song together or have Mike cover one of her songs.<br /><br />Every track is good and very bass heavy.  Funny thing is I probably listen to \\"Royals\\" the least.  Tennis Court is my favorite track on the album and my other favorites are \\"Team\\", and \\"Glory and Gore\\".<br /><br />This album has a way of soothing you with the smooth harmonies and her voice is so calming, then that baas hits.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Great season and series . If you likes the show &#34;24&#34; than this series is for you. I watched it several times and love it !!!!
0385523386|1.0|I usually do not like to do book reviews but since they will turn this into a TV show I thought I throw my 5 cents in..<br />It's easy to read but it's really not a \\"overcoming hardships\\" kind of life story.<br />We are talking middle class good life, short and easy stint in prison for moving money that came from drug dealing. Author received a slap on the wrist with minimum time and is whining where she should be grateful to have gotten away with such little and easy time.<br />Nothing compared to people that REALLY had a rough upbringing and then got sentenced to many years in tougher prisons, since they were not middle class and were caught with the drugs and not the drug-money..(which is same difference in my opinion).<br />I worked in prison for a decade, the author has no clue that her stay resembled a spa-vacation!<br />A shame that with good agents but no story you can make a ton of money!
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Great show wish it wouldn't end. Me and my friends are going to start doing slap bets now.I said a band bang bang bangity bang
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app works great! First e print app that actually does print to my network printer at home. I use it on my Motorola Droid Maxx
0307454541|5.0|I bought this after seeing the movie. I was hooked instantly (and am now in the process of reading book 3)<br />I started reading the night I got it and couldn't put it down until I was finished (which was around 6 in the morning).<br /><br />I -should- take 1 star away for packaging though. I bought new and it looked Used. Packaging could've been better too, was sent in a bubble mailer nearly 2 sizes too small. In fact, it had a hole in the bottom of it. (sorry, I'm -really- picky about how books are treated)<br /><br />But, that aside, I'm putting the stars towards the book/story itself which was amazing.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love the game lot of fun<br />Have fun popping the bubbles and the baby dragons r so cute<br />And they fly around
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Enjoyable game that requires some planning to not end up with a single button. Adds nice variety to the game world. As your skill increases there are larger puzzles to provide a new challenge.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|This movie is abysmal.  Shot in an all gray color palette (nothing could be further from lurid comic illustrations!) it's tedious on the eyes, the plot makes no sense, the actors are all poorly cast and seem to be confused as to why they're there (so am I) and it's just flat out BORING.  Amy Adams as Lois Lane is not even remotely believable.<br /><br />We open with a scene straight out of Dungeons & Dragons, with the people of S-man's homeworld flying around on giant winged creatures and declaiming in cryptic yet trite EPIC FANTASY SPEECHES!  S-man's dad shoots him into space with a specially recorded message (offscreen, we imagine, mom asks can she leave a message for her only son too?  you know, since she's about to die and all.  NOPE!).<br /><br />The rest of the movie is split between boring flashbacks and Superman punching things (in the most boring way imaginable).  To enjoy this movie you would have to be brain damaged.
0399255370|5.0|This is my new favorite children's book! It is cleverly written from the perspective of the crayons, most of whom are disgruntled. My five year old son loves this book and I have purchased more to give as gifts.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|While Matthew McConaughey is featured prominently on the poster for this movie and he is the title character, the film seems to be more influenced by movies like \\"The Goonies,\\" \\"Stand by Me\\" and more recently \\"Super 8.\\"  I think fans of \\"Beasts of the Southern Wild\\" would also appreciate the movie.  It offers a very vibrant sense of \\"place\\" that oozes through every frame.  The place is the Mississippi River as it runs through Arkansas and the people are those who make their lives from it.  The film centers on two 14-year-old Arkansas boys (Ellis and Neckbone) who value friendship and yearn for adventure and romance in equal measure.<br /><br />The film scored 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.  That doesn't happen unless you've made a quality film.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|The book is written in letter form from Charlie telling tales from his first year of high school, dealing with loving someone he can't have and just growing up.
0399160450|5.0|I'm going to miss him. I'll start re-reading his books and maybe some of his books that have not been published, will come out in the future. His books with co-authors have been up there too.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I am addicted to this show now.  Hardly a day goes bye without watch at least one episode. I love this show!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved the book. This book is great inspirational fuel to last for a lifetime. :)Definitely a good book to re-read if you have already read it once too. :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is such a great book for both kids (10 and up) and adults.  It shows the power of a kind word or a kind act.  A definite must read.
1451626088|5.0|I thought the novel did an excellent job of telling the story of Anne Neville and how she rose from naive girl to knowledgeable woman.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I do not like or dislike cables, I have no intention to think about the question &#34;why not?'. By, by.
B007M45PMU|5.0|So so good. Definitely recommend buying this album, such a good price for an amazing cd. Just buy it, you won't be sorry.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I absolutely love all of Flynn's books, have recommended them to everyone.  He is in the same category as Clancy, Thor, Silva, and Baldacci.  Also included is Nelson DeMille.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|By it now and then play you can play a endless laboratory of evil<br />Scientist and its free so buy it
159463176X|5.0|I didn't read the book (bought it as a gift for a friend). It arrived in great shape and on time. I was very pleased.
6305428042|5.0|One of my all-time favorite Halloween movies! I had looked for in it many stores, & finally decided just to buy it online. It's a must-see movie for people of all ages!
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Maybe it's just me but I expected more form this film. Not just special effects or &#34;high flying&#34; action but maybe just a little more substance?  Then again, I may be asking to much from the writers.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The side buttons are in a good position, it's comfortable to hold, and you can change it's color. The wire also feels pretty nice, not made of rubber. Only 2 complaints, the right side of the mouse is a dirt magnet and when I scroll really fast, the scroll button squeaks. I mean, I know it's a mouse, but it get's kind of annoying =P.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|I love the action, mystery and love affair between Denzel and Paula Patton as well as,his commitment to save her.
B009NYF2GQ|5.0|Been looking for several classics for my mom for many years, and they finally have them at the prices I can afford. Thank you.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Enjoyed the game. I have played it twice since i bought it. Its definitely a keeper. Lots of puzzles and hidden objects..my favorite kind.
B00007J5VN|5.0|Been looking for several classics for my mom for many years, and they finally have them at the prices I can afford. Thank you.
B006POGWHK|5.0|I have never seen dancing like this before...The drama, the film-making, the power of each dancer, the choreography, the story- telling...This is one of the most remarkable films I've ever seen. I will watch it again and again.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|At first it looks as if this will be a horrible movie, but not after watching it. Enjoyable as long as you can stand the gore and action and light story.
1616550414|5.0|this book is perfect for any Zelda fan, giving the insight of the history as well as concept art and even a manga bonus at the end. Just perfect
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is one of the best series I have ever seen.  Love that time frame the the actors are superb.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Following the lead of the writer of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; this movie chooses to not reveal the source of the virus. Also, no hint at an explanation of the zombies ability to tell the sick from the healthy (guess they mimic the cancer sniffing dogs in the news). The only saving grace of this movie is some very good acting, which makes up for the weak story line and lack of support for the same said story line in the movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a good reproduction of the animals from the movie. Hours of fun. Could become addictive.<br />Loved the pirate jokes.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Overall, enjoyable book. Skipped here and there when I felt the parts had nothing to contribute. The role of Bailey still baffles me. -JM
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|This is a great mystery, I have watched it many times, it keeps u on the edge of your seat because you really haven't a clue what is really happening.  It is great....
B00A69JZQU|5.0|Really changed my views of where social media is headed. You will embrace the platforms after reading this. Great book!
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|I have wanted to watch this for quite a while.  Hokey? Yeah.  Kids' movie? Yeah.  It was exactly what I thought it would be.  Fun and a lot of good solid action with some humor stuck in.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Well it's very fun but the should start us out with more peanuts because it's not fun if they just give us stuff and then tell us to waste them other wise AWESOME
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|They compared it to the Matrix...nah, but still a decent movie.  The cast was well-chosen, the plot was good, the action kept you going.  You weren't going to fall asleep, but it did get kinda slow.  It was that type of movie; they wanted to explain what was happening.  Weird plot, but that never stopped me before.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS MY LIFE I CANT IMAGINE MY LIFE WITHOUT IT IT IS THE BOMB you all better download it if ypur smart
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Interesting, fun, dating, exciting....an adventure that will keep you on your toes.  It was definitely worth my time and money.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Its fun, I got this when it was free for my kindle so I could not go wrong. Fun and entertaining
B00594XOZU|5.0|I'm tried loging in my account but it keeps saying &quot;this is taking longer then it should try again later&quot;
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love love love this show. It is sad yet amazing. If you don't watch it you really should. Do it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The more I read the more I could not put it down. The anticipation of finding out what happened to Chrissy was thrilling.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Nice game.  Interesting graphics and sound.  Good controls.  Nothing really negative about it.  Interested in more games from this developed.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Headset turn off for itself and turn on for itself, during few seconds, but it's is rarely. Sometimes, it doesn't work the volume on the headset, so I restart it.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I been watching this tv series for the past few months and Im totally digging it.  I would highly recommend that everyone watch this.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|I enjoyed watching every moment of this movie! It is funny,colorful, and teaches an important lesson to both kids and parents. If you want to have a good time an watch and Family Fun movie this is the best movie to watch!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I have read every single Stephen King book since the 70s. I was super excited for this one. It totally did not go where I had hoped it would. Although a good story it went off track pretty fast. I was expected more supernatural scares but it didn't deliver any of those. Again a good book just not great as it could have been.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so fun. You get to take care of your very own horse, compete, and dress your horse. So fun!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|My grandson enjoys playing this and earning money for more dinosaurs. No problems with the game so far regarding downloading or freezing.  Would like to have the dollar amounts we earn more so we can buy stuff without real money to have enough dollars.
B00EHMG358|4.0|Come on Aloysius, where  are you ? Great start to what looks like another winner! Preston and Child are two of my favorite authors. Nice to see Carrie in an adventure of her own...
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I loved it!  The second movie was just as good as the first one, hoping maybe there will be third movie..
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is great! I recommend this game to anyone who loves puzzles and finding hidden objects. A great way to pass the time!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I'm on there every day just window shopping for now but I plan on doing my Christmas shopping with it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game you can get.I loved Minoan run but now that I play subway surfers I play for hours.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|its a lot like zoo tycoon and im kinda hooked on playing it for now its a very nice game
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I love it, my 4 years old son can play it, everyone understand it really quickly and is very challenging.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Julian Fellows has a wonderful talent for writing period dramas. The cast is amazing! You will find yourself falling in love with the characters.
B009FXIICK|3.0|Interesting at first but quickly it became very boring and repetitive. It is not rewarding. I played it a couple of times and later I disliked it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'm playing with a friend who is hard to beat which brings out my competitive nature.  I can't stop playing!!
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Does everything it said that it was going to do. I think that if you need a weather app this is the one.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best book I've read in years. It's super funny and a great book for everyone.  I enjoyed reading it
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is a blast.  Very simple to play, starts out slow and after a few mini games it gets faster and faster and fasterer.  For such a simple game I find myself playing it over and over again.<br /><br />I have it on a Kindle Fire so the plane game doesn't work (but that's why they give you the option to turn that game off).  I can never seem to beat the cleaning up puke game, not sure if that's just me, though.<br /><br />And when you unlock the music video, you're in for a fun little treat.  I've been singing the Dumb Ways to Die song in my head for days now.<br /><br />And, for the love of god, people, please be safe around trains.
B006M4F67A|3.0|It's lots of fun and very  interesting keeps the brain working<br />Would tell everyone to play it keep the games coming
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We've become addicted to this hickey which, briefly described, turns our 'dumb' HD TV into a 'smart' TV and turns our iPads and iPhone into remotes.  Seamlessly installed, and provides HD television without pauses or hangups even on our 3 MPBS WiFi signal that comes from a DSL ISP.<br /><br />The only very minor glitch (without which would have moved it from 4 stars to 5) is that often there is a confusing delay of  few seconds between when you input a command (like 'play') and the response is seen on the TV, but once you recognize that it can happen it's easy to compensate for.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Amazing! Was not disappointing!  Everything I hoped it would be! Glad I waited to view it on my own tv.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I think this is the best SH series out there. The dynamic between SH & DW is perfect. Enjoyed everyone!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I did not want this story to end and if I have a criticism, it would be that it ended too soon. I would like to know what happened to Vivian ( did she form a strong bond with her birth daughter?) and what happened between Molly and Vivian (did the relationship continue?). Will there be a sequel?
B0081336FO|5.0|The second season does not disappoint.  The great dynamic continues between SH & DW, we begin to see some of the emotional walls of SH crumble.  I also think Moriarty is perfectly played - inhuman, demented, crazy.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|Had never heard about the secret code in the war where they were instructed to kill the code talkers if they were in danger of being captured. A remarkable film that showed interesting relationships and friendships among the soldiers.
0143119680|5.0|I do not normally get into vampire books, but this series took me by surprise. Once I got started I was riveted. The world of creatures became so fascinating that I hated to stop reading.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and always love it.  I wish they would release the series on blu-ray
B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm having trouble using it.  I need to learn more about it, when I do I  am sure I will love it, until then I am trying.
B00F9040HU|2.0|This game is extremely easy... completed the first city in about 20 minutes!  Not challenging at all and not free as stated.  Don't waste your time!  I gave it 2stars because the graphics were nice.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|We were fascinated to see Will Smith play a completely different kind of character and he totally pulled it off. At first I was amazed to read some of the criticism but I think it comes from those expecting his typical humor. Once you accept him in this new serious kind of role and let go of the MIB type character, you can appreciate the movie's intent. Jadan does a great job playing his intended character as well.<br />Concerning complaints of nepotism; so what if Will Smith gives his son opportunities to hone his craft? Do people really expect a father to not cast his son in a role because his is his son?<br />I don't know why this movie is getting a bad rap. M. Shamalyn has made some of our favorite movies, we enjoyed this one and will continue to look forward to any that he directs.<br />My honest rating for this one is closer to 3.5 but felt the need to try to offset the misguidedly low ratings. If you are willing to forego the typical will smith sci-fi character and just watch it for what it is, you will enjoy it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! I would recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers. Couldn't put it down. Great read!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I thought I'd rather choke to death than watch another damn vampire movie, but then this came along. So, so great. What a wonderful and powerful film.<br /><br />Creepy as hell too.
B000CZ0Q5W|4.0|I just got introduced to this artists music and from what I've heard so far this is one of his best. The disc was in pristine condition and I am highly satisfied with the product and the purchase. A marred case caused the missing star.
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|This game is formulaic there is no story involved it is just a raw search not very creative at that. I suspect the first 13 reviews were stuffing the box by the designers over the past month. The &quot;reviews&quot; over enthusiasm point out the games features. Get real.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I got hooked on this series by the recommendation of a friend around New Year's Eve/Day of 2011/2012. I borrowed the books from him and I couldn't put them down or read them fast enough! I honestly think I read the whole series in a 2-2 1/2 week time frame. I then got my own copies of the books because I wanted to re-read them after the first movie came out that March. And I then bought it on Kindle because it was on sale for all three and would be great for travel! So I've bought and read it multiple times because I love it so much!<br />Now the thought of society actually getting to a point where something like the Hunger Games is implemented is a disturbing thought; however it does cause you to think: \\"What would make something like this come about? What could we do to prevent something like this? What would we do if something like this did happen? Would it be similar to the character's reactions, and if so, which one?\\"<br />It is also well written. The descriptions of the situations, the character's feelings, and the events are so vivid, yet respectful; and in some places, reverent to who they are to the story. I will admit that the first couple of chapters in book one were a little slow moving for me; however, once the main characters, Katniss and Peeta, go to the Capitol,I am hooked and I can't put them down! So many twists and turns that chapters, and even the end of one book, leaves you hanging for the next to the point of sleep does not matter! You must keep reading!!<br />So, get it, read it, you will love it! And May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor!!

B00338QENI|5.0|A story that needed to be told! Fascinating, heart breaking, and thought provoking - what do you want done with YOUR medical &#34;scraps?&#34;
B00H83EUL2|5.0|Survivalist movies are a favorite sub-genre of mine. I love stories about the underdogs beating the odds and overcoming seemingly impossible circumstances. I'm not a big sci-fi fan. I don't generally like stuff about outer space, aliens or monsters. I like a little realism in my movies, which is something that the sci-fi genre doesn't really know how to do.<br /><br />The beautiful thing about &#34;Gravity&#34; is that every single thing that happens in it is possible. It all could happen in real life. It's a story about how deeply powerful the human spirit is, and how the will to survive can be more powerful than anything that might stand in a person's way. &#34;Gravity&#34; is every bit as much a character study as it is a popcorn movie. How often can you say that about a movie? It's pretty damn special.<br /><br />&#34;Gravity&#34; follows Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a medical engineer who is just about to finish a 42-day long space mission with NASA with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). While they're up there, flying satellite debris destroys their spaceship, leaving the two stranded in space, the sole survivors of this mission gone horribly wrong.<br /><br />The film opens with an absolutely spectacular 13-minute long panoramic shot that sets the entire film in motion. It could be a flawless short film. The film ensues with many more extended shots that are done so beautifully. It's hard to believe this movie could be pulled off so seamlessly. It's the work of a masterful director, Alfonso Cuaron, who hasn't worked since 2006's Children of Men, which was an incredible film as well. However, I think &#34;Gravity&#34; will be remembered as his best work.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock, who I think of as mainly a comedic actress, has pulled off a couple good dramatic performances over the years. She even won the Oscar for 2009's &#34;The Blind Side&#34;. However, you've never seen her like this. Over the course of the film's brief 90 minutes, she hasto play so many different emotions, that it's evident this is the work of an incredible actress. Her character goes from being scared out of her mind, to the &#34;I'm just going to give up&#34; depression, to deciding that life is worth fighting for. Her backstory is simple, but it is enough to make you connect with this character, and feel for her every step of the way.<br /><br />George Clooney has a smaller part, but he does a great job with what he has. It's really Bullock's movie. It's a showcase for her remarkable talent as an actress, but it's also so much more than that. There's gorgeous symbolism and underlying themes of religion, death and rebirth. It's an intellectual popcorn movie, which is something that we certainly don't see enough in American cinema.<br /><br />Grade: A+

B00821PCJS|3.0|Wouldn't call it a ground-breaking show... But there's definately entertaining value there, not to mention solid production and special effects. It raises the bar for sci-fi TV, which really needs higher quality expectations.
B00838HSYM|1.0|I thought I was ordering the Disney classic and instead got a version that will only play in Europe.  I didn't know there was such a thing, but you should explain that clearly in the ordering process.  I wasted the time and money to order and have a useless product to show for it.
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call is a novel about WWII Luftwaffe fighter pilot ace named Franz Stigler. Stigler was raised into a flying family. His father was a WWI fighter pilot and his brother would become a bomber pilot. Being raised as a very devout Catholic, he was raised and taught that the Nazi party was a bad political party. As the years progressed Franz became a transport pilot and eventually a trainer for upcoming pilots for the Luftwaffe. After training many, many pilots Stigler would become a German fighter pilot ace himself. Stigler was brought up by another German ace named Gustav Roland, who believed that everything was honor (he famously once said that if he hears about any of his pilots shooting at parachuters he will personally shoot them himself). Brought up with this motto and upbringing, he would become a fantastic and most of all, a respectable pilot. One night a couple of B-52, and B-19 bombers began to attack a factory in northern Germany that produces German B-109 fighter planes. On this fateful night an American Bomber pilot stationed in Great Britain named Charlie Brown. He flew his B-19 flying fortress called &#34;Ye Old Pub&#34; right into a mess of B-109's flying right at him. They destroyed two of his engines, this made him fall behind and out of formation. This made Charlie and his crew a sitting duck for German anti-air and flak. Being hit multiple times, &#34;Ye Old Pub's&#34; guns were disabled. Charlie then was knocked out by the freezing cold air and the plane went into a dangerous nose dive. Thinking that the plane was going to crash the fighter pilots backed off and the flak stopped firing. Miraculously, the plane leveled itself out and Charlie woke to a calm fly. He them turned around in the completely ruined B-19 and started heading back towards England. This is when Franz Stigler a 29 victory pilot who was one more victory away from the Knights Cross (Germany's highest regarded medal for a pilot). As Stigler approached the barely flying B-19, he truly noticed how battered it actually was. Stigler then saw the planes crew huddling together trying to keep warm. Stigler then remembered his Captain motto and then thought of the planes as shooting down a parachuter. He decided to try and guide the plane to land safely in the neutral country of Switzerland. Charlie kept pushing on England, Stigler was worried because he knew that the coast of France was infested with German flak. Courageously, Stigler flew by the wing of the B-19 hoping that the Germans would not shoot down one of their own planes to take out an enemy. Charlie just barley over 100 feet above the ground safely landed in England.<br /><br />This story shows that even the two opposite sides can work together and help each other out. This way of doing things should show up more often in out world today.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Bought this game because the free one was really good. Disappointed that this one is the same as the free one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was my first book by this author. Kept me guessing and kept me interested.<br />I thought about it when I wasn't reading it which to me is the tell of a good book.<br />I'll try the author's other books.

Did not even take it out of the computer since I used it last.<br /><br />$50 TO REPLACE? It still takes 1-3 weeks to do? I need the program I spent so much money on TOMORROW.<br /><br />A complete scam, now I can't even use the $300 program I bought. No way to contact iLok, the device is still under warranty? How in the world are these people still in business?<br /><br />I'm waiting for the class action lawsuit. This is extortion of the worst kind.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I really enjoyed the show. There are always twists and turns I never expect to keep me on my toes.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|A friend mentioned this movie and talked about the message he thought was behind it, so I thought I watch it. On top of that it is Will Smith one of my favorite actors and his son, who is a good actor as well and did a great job in the Karate kid.  Plus on top of that my son's name is the same except for the last name of course. I thought this was a great movie and the message of Fear and what it's origin is, so true.  From beginning to end it is a great movie!!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works very well and is easy to configure and set up. I don't have a Netflix account so the only thing I can use it with is YouTube. I would have liked to have seen more apps support this device at launch but I'm hopeful that more app developers will add support for this device. It works very well if you want to watch YouTube or Netflix on your big screen TV.
B00821PCJS|2.0|I just watched the first episode and gave up.  A thin and simpleminded plot that seems to be the expected norm.  Perhaps it gets better later on but that's for someone else to discover.
0240815807|5.0|My title for this review may seem over the top but it is the truth. I have been recording music since 1982 when I bought a little Tascam 244 to record song ideas for my band. Over the last 30 years my equipment and skills have improved but I still could not attain \\"that sound\\".  This book covers areas that brings one closer to \\"that sound\\".<br /><br />The author spends nearly half the book covering room and monitoring. There are other books that have covered this area but it was always done in a way that was either too technical or too vague.  In this book, the subjects are put in away that not only make sense but immediately become useful. For me, moving my existing monitors in accordance to the books directions has substantially changed what I am hearing and providing me notice of what I am not hearing.  The author recognizes that most of us do not have $200,000 or even $2,000.00 to spend changing our existing recording space to give optimum sound. With these realities, the author gives suggestions that will give you noticeable improvements on your monitoring environment.<br /><br />Using the authors suggestions, it has made me realize that so many other books I have read are designed to take my money and put it into the pocket of others. Those others being those books' publishers, authors, and equipment manufacturers. The only thing the author of this book truly recommends are certain types of nearfield monitors. Though he does suggest a few particular manufactures, it is context with his suggestions concerning ported vs. non-ported monitors. I have not at this point switched to unported monitors but I am planning to do so solely based on my application of the authors techniques I have implemented.<br /><br />If you are looking for mixing recipes or the perfect compression settings, this book will not help you. However, if you are looking to find out how to mix properly and create your own perfect compression settings then this book is for you. I have found thatI am less interested in the lastest hype on new plug-ins or hardware because I have discovered better results with the tools I have already.<br /><br />The book is the one tool I wish I had 30-years ago. It is the one tool that I am happy to have now.

B005HP2JAM|5.0|A terrific video! Very good 3D effects and narration. It gives one a new insight into our ancestors. I have always thought of Ancients as being limited in talents and ability. After seeing the quality of their artwork, I am thinking we have not progressed as much as I thought. They were pretty much just like we are today, only without our advantages gathered in the last 35,000 years. Get this video, you will be better for it.

B002GHIPYI|3.0|The Superlux HD 681 stands as a revelatory example of a Chinese manufactured, mass market<br />consumer product aimed at the low budget consumer (what isn't???).<br />My previous experience is with a JVC Harx700 and the Sennheiser HD201s. Two similar<br />products within the same range as the 681. As with all my cans I put 50-60 hrs of burn in before<br />I listened to it. Its been mostly run from a Sony Dvd, and the Topping TP21. Airy but slightly harsh top<br />end, with great resolving mids, but semi- absent bass. Thats where the hole in this headphone lies.<br />The soundstage is expansive! My first open/semi open can so the sound profile of an open design has<br />been wonderful for me. Don't proceed as I've had with amping this can. An Ipods/Sansa's output would be fine,<br />as well as PC audio<br /><br />The Comfort: This can is dangerously uncomfortable and therefore unable to be listened to for more than an hour<br />at given time.<br />I have a small head and the clamping has left me in pain with its circumaural design.<br />Bottom earcups rest right at my jaw line and is not a comfortable thing.<br />Overall its a descent buy to get a peak into the open can world.<br />There's a reason why any one person would spend $300 on a Sennheiser or Beyer<br />or Grado. Sound/ vs Comfort/ (I'll say that one time only!)<br />As for this can... I assume there are better offerings within this context. Akg, Ive heard, as well<br />Audio Technica (see Ath Ad700, $80 to $150-$160 dollar price jump yikes!).<br />I'll certain go on to better things in my personal listening journey. The 681 will remain my starting<br />place&#62; But beware!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|App stops running as soon as I try and connect to my church, guess it is not good for kindle.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|My son introduced me to John Green (& his brother, Hank) about a year ago when he was studying for a middle school chemistry exam. He had somehow found the Green Brothers' video series, Crash Course, in which John and Hank take all that &#34;boring&#34; stuff that teachers teach and make it interesting and memorable. If you have never watched a Crash Course video, go watch one now! So, even though I have been a fan of John Green's for a year, The Fault in Our Stars is the first of his novels that I have read.<br /><br />I've known about this novel since soon after it was published but have avoided it because a friend had told me she cried through the entire books. I don't like sad books so avoided this book like the plague. Yet, as a John Green fan, I felt like I had to read this book and finally gave in and purchased The Fault in Our Stars when it was on sale for the Kindle.<br /><br />A day and a half into this novel, I was feeling pretty cocky about the fact that I had yet to cry and then it happened...the tears came and came and came. Yes, this is a tearjerker but it is a beautiful tearjerker and it is worth the read. The Fault in Our Stars reminds us how fragile life is and how short it can be.<br /><br />Now, I know why so many people have deep feelings about this story...I guess I do, too, now. Go read it, now..
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This movie has great effects. I also liked the story line. I would highly recommend this movie. The digital copy is also great!
1401322786|3.0|I expected... something deeper I guess. It's a good story, very good. Very well written and everything. I can easily see it as a movie. Not surprising since Mitch Albom has done quite a few screenplays.<br />I just expected it to deliver something more, philosophical I guess. Something to make me think. While it was an enjoyable read, it didn't quite ignite my mind.<br />Of course this is just my opinion. Take it as is.<br /><br />Other than that, the book shipped and arrived in good time, mint condition and no problems. So can't complain.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Great movie! The story of sound city is very interesting. Loved the extras also. Seeing how the musicians wrote and recorded songs was very cool.

B00D48BSBA|4.0|Very gripping and absorbing. Typical Forsyth style. Well researched and informative about terrorist network. A must read. Good time pass.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My 3 and 6 year olds love it. It gives you lots of &#34;lives&#34; which helps little people enjoy it.
B006BQM762|3.0|A bunch of precocious movie kid stereotypes making a movie in the 80's see a train wreck and a mysterious creature.  The rest is okay.  But where is Chunk when you need him?
0375869026|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone age 10 and up who loves characters who feel like they could be your neighbors, values kindness, and appreciates the soaring heights that everyday people can be reach.<br /><br />I wish I could more eloquently articulate what a meaningful, moving story I found this book to be, but since I'm having trouble choosing the right words, I'll just say: Read it,and you'll see the wonder for yourself.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|you'd really have to be bad at programming if you screw up UNO. There's not more to be expected of the game than what it delivers.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I absolutely adored this book and loved everything about it.  I couldn't put it down right from the start.  I felt like I was there with the characters and felt their feelings.  By far one of the best books he has written yet.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|It keeps the kids busy which is what i wanted. It has really nice color renderings and the interface is acceptable.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Thrilling book. Very fast read as I. Couldn't put it down. Full suspense and very exciting. Jack is an awesome character and Lee Child has the right recipe for great stories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Head to head with Harry Potter. Definitely worth the read. Terrifying but realistic. Collins wrote an amazing series of books.
B00915G6MG|5.0|It's NCIS what's not to like.  The cast is so very talented and the writers and directors are so in tune with<br />the characters as they have been developed over the years.

B009RX7IX8|5.0|I was very satisfied with the quality of the series and really enjoy the special features and voice over commentaries<br />by stars and directors
B006IDG2T6|5.0|For someone who was vaguely familiar with the arguments for and against the issue of free will, this was an excellent starting point, as it focus on well-researched scientific evidence, and coherent and logical arguments. Harris also takes time to de-construct and refute some of the arguments that oppose his main thesis, suck as Daniel Dennett's postulates.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang please make an update I think we really would like to have the following :<br />ender men, Redstone,wolves and dogs, caves, better nether ,and more biomes.<br />Please like if you think these things should be put into minecraft pe
B00F91RYL8|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this! I was stressed out from scene one and the stress continued (but in a good edge of your seat way) I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I wish the ending was a bit more developed--it felt like it just stopped so it was a bit anti-climatic for me.<br />Great movie to watch when you need a little zombie fun! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read, literally couldn't put it down. So many details! The ending brought tears to my eyes. Definitely recommend this.

B0071XO8RA|1.0|I had high hopes for this book based on the Amazon reviews. This book does not have a plot or characterization. I made it about 200 pages in and I'm calling it quits.
0375826742|5.0|A great read especially when wanting escape from the real world for a time. Or just a littleme time. Enjoy!
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I really loved this movie, simply because the story was wrapped around an unpopular relationship, father and son.(Family-to include Kit's sister Senshi as secondary focus)  And of course the setting is in a science fiction environment.  It just comes to show just how immature people are about our relationships with our dads/fathers, fact.  So don't be hating and taking it out on this movie because of the fact.  I really enjoyed the colors of the movie and the storyline.  This movie is a wonderful piece of art.  People are just so technically focused, watch tons of other movies to compare it against and hold it against some nebulous standard, probably some racist motivations hidden in through negativity.  I wished men/women were much more emotionally mature in which seems they are not judging by their extreme outrage of expectations.  These persons just sound so spoiled, that's all, like children at that.  Trust me, if you have not had cable for as long as I had, you would have loved it/enjoyed as well as I did since I simply choose this movie by my own will not by multimedia commercials/trailers/etc fueling developing expectations like cable tv does nowadays.  Some of the reviews I breezed through looks falsified, I know the Tea Party Does that, they admitted that in a hidden camera through some training program.  So we know it happens one way or another.  I also noticed how apparent it seems that people already have preconceived notions about the movie before he/she seen it.  Anyways, all these lies etc. will surmount to discrediting the entire rating system because of many liars and underdeveloped characters.  I do hope reviewers quite with their \\"poor acting\\" and get their act together!

B003B02O14|4.0|but I won't give that away. I generally read that genre designated as literary fiction (usually prize winning novels) but Grisham usually writes well, creatively constructs the story, and develops interesting characters, which is the case with this intriguing tale. I have read 2 or 3 of his novels and found them all easy and pleasant to read as was this one. I found myself struggling about a quarter of the way through the book because all of the characters are flawed but I found myself worrying about the fate of the main character even though he is portrayed a thief and a murderer, a credit, I guess, to the author's abilities. Despite the ending, I think the story well worth reading.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Would except a little more from a film with Cruise and Freeman, but still a decent Sci Fi movie. Decent special effects and OK story but just not a top notch movie. I enjoyed it, but was left hoping for  a bit better movie.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I devoured this book quickly. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis two months ago and told by my doctor to go gluten free the rest of my life. My initial response was to hunt for every gluten free product to replace every snack and treat I love..  Just before reading this book I realized those products are really not what I should be eating, all the starches and all and I really didn't feel great after eating them. I have decided to go totally carb free for four weeks to start. I already feel amazing and am so looking forward to all the other benefits.  I am hoping for the hair loss to slow down and eczema to start to dissipate after 40 years. I will repost again to update on my progress.

B000XUBC5E|3.0|Can you ever have  too many twists and turns?  I think you can.  Mr. Coben went just a bit too far with this book.  Double, triple and quadruple crosses make for a muddle of a book, but I finished it based mostly on Mr. Coben's writing skills and not his plot structure.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|The label on the box's  picture on Amazon seems toindicate that you get an unrated version and a theatrical version on both the DVD and Blu-Ray discs.  Amazon's details on the product indicates that you only get an unrated version and only states the unrated run time of the movie; which is wrong by the way, it should be 122 minutes.  The reality of the situation is you only get the unrated version on Blu-Ray and the theatrical version on DVD.  Somewhat disapointing since at some locations I do not have a Blu-ray player.  The theatrical version only is on the digital version with english track only.  Would be good if Amazon has a picture of both sides of the box so one could obtain it for itself before buying.<br /><br />The movie is interesting, a little different from other zombie movies I've seen.  These zombies  are harder to kill.  In the past you shoot them, they are down, but in this movie they get up again and keep on coming.  One would think that when you blow them up the little pieces would still be coming or reassemble.  Maybe in the sequel.  Anyway, my favorite part is when they are in Israel quite an impresive scene.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I have to admit that I often skip some of the words as I read. Always in a hurry. But this time I did NOT. I felt that if I skipped even one word I would miss something.
0307476073|5.0|I purchased and read this book for a book club discussion. I truly enjoyed Cheryl Strayed's writing style. Lots of sensory details. The story itself is remarkable. It certainly made for lively discussion, as some participants in the book club felt she was ill-prepared for her adventure, and felt she was remarkably fortunate to have survived.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|Two things are sure. This is one hell of a well written novel, and the author has done his homework on the subject matter. I will leave the longer and more detailed reviews to others as they are not my strong suit. Suffice to say you will enjoy both this author and his work. Grab a copy now. What the hell. Grab two.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|very cute game keeps you on your toes landscape keeps changing..very cool graphics and lots of animation makes this a fun game.
B00421IR5I|5.0|it is a movie that you can show to your student in class.The story is very good and very well played.<br />it is a must have for anybody who loves foreign movies.
B00EXVZW6E|2.0|Looks like a great game, just not for visually impaired folks:(<br />If the developer would add a zoom , I would be able to see what is to be found!<br />Add a zoom feature folks!  There are many people who are in need of enlarging objects!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Got this book recommended. Had a slow start-up, but once it got going it was intertaining and different from most other crime novels i've read recently. Interesting inner dialogs, but the pace of the book is uneven and a bit messy. The ending also feels bit abrupt, like the author needed to close it with a last minut twist.
B00846REIS|5.0|It's about how complicated a relationship in the real world is except some of the messed up parts. Jealously we all have it it haunts us and breaks us.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I have always wanted to see this movie as I had heard good reviews. Well to my pleasure the movie was a five star indeed. Christian Bale was excellent ( I'm a big CB fan.) Mark Wahlberg was also great. He being &#34; the fighter&#34; learning from his brother who is on drugs but knows how and what to teach his brother. Very good story delivered to you in movie format. As based on true story. Well worth what I paid for it. A must see movie for anyone.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I play this game daily and ones you start playing you get hours and hours of fun. specially if you have friends in other cities.

0061537969|3.0|The Art of Racing in The Rain was suggested by the NYT Reviews if you like a slice of Kramer vs Kramer and Love Story, Bingo.  Sorry, not Bingo but Enzo, is the star of this story much in Disney form Enzo wants to be a human and enjoys the foibles and conundrums of everyday life and playing with the birds and looking over the family that slowly falls apart.  This book is getting 5 stars hands down from everyone and it is the most sentimental dose of sentimentality imaginable.  People you need to take your brains back and have them restored, or do you like to cry?  This was gratuituous sobbing and that is good if you like sobbing, I don't.
B009OYTIXS|1.0|can you please release this ARROW on prime instant,was going to watch but have to pay.so im going to netflix,..
B00CHVJI08|3.0|Love the movie but I had to wait so long for it!! It was on sale at Walmart way before I got it.
B00DP94Z2W|4.0|I like a few Newsted songs, and we wanted to get the cd before seeing them live in concert. This fit the bill! it's a dent cd and we had prior to the concert. My big beef is that I had to buy some songs individually to get them all. But I did it to have what we needed before the show, which was only a few days after its release.
B0092SQBJA|2.0|Amazon kept recommending two door cinema club to me. I gave it a shot and wished I didn't. Too synthesized. I prefer a more guitarzy white stripes or black keys sound. Live and learn
B0026SFEW8|4.0|Fun to watch and see how times looked back then, before the turmoil of modern day life. Like I said &#34;fun movie&#34;.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is the most captevating show I have watched in years. The characters, costuming, sets, etc are very accurate to the period. The show gives you a true glimpse to the happenings during the era.<br /><br />I would recommend this show to anyone.
1401938906|5.0|I was stunned to see how quickly the first exercise worked for me! That was &#34;The Dude Abides&#34; principle. She suggests giving it 48 hours, and it hasn't even been that long. In fact, last night (about 2 hours after I'd read and put out my request to the universe or  I went to a jazz concert with my brother and we were dismayed to learn it was sold out. The man at the ticket table said we could put our names on the waiting list, so we did. We were 17th and 18th on that list. There were quite a few people standing around waiting, too. We wandered around the halls of the facility while waiting and then we heard names being called on the waiting list. We hurried back to the table. It sounded to me like five or six names had been called, then I heard a woman at the ticket table ask the man with the list what number they were on. He said, &#34;Sixteen.&#34; I was suddenly quite hopeful we'd get in. Yet, the whole time I had this deep feeling of peace and I remember thinking, &#34;If we don't get in, it's no big deal. We'll be okay! Apparently, some folks had called in by phone to give up their tickets. Then he called my name and we got two tickets and got two great seats! The emcee was doing a little audience warm-up when we sat down and then we heard the whole concert...Somehow, I knew this was the answer to my request, even though I never thought it would have anything to do with this concert. Here's the other odd thing: I could have gotten the tickets on-line if I'd wanted to do it earlier. I had thought of that, but there was a big resistance inside me to do so as somehow I felt (before I'd read or even had the book--I got the Kindle edition yesterday) that we would see this concert. I just knew we would see it. There had been a question of whether my sister-in-law would come, too, and I wasn't sure how many tickets we would need. (She did not come to it.) But I felt this deep sense of calm and peace that we would get in. There was no anxiety. I knew this was at least part of the answer to my request from the &#34;FP&#34; (&#34;Field of Potentiality&#34;)!. Thanks so much!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I love this game.  The graphics and tasks are great. The daily tasks and free gem options are w wonderful alternative to spending lots of money.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Dangit this series caught me!  I did not think it would be good found it hard to get through delirium but I'm hooked. Headed  to read the third one now !
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I generally do not care for fantasy, but this book is the exception. It's a very imaginative story, well told by a master story teller. Delightful.
1620404869|4.0|Easy read with a good ending! It's not a very long book, so it should take you no time at all to finish. Cute story!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|The app was wonderful at first. Then they updated it and destroyed it. I now have the most difficult time downloading a video and most of the time it would freeze and I would have to restart it. Before the patch was great. Why fix it if it isn't broken.<br /><br />DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Leonard Cohen is fantastic.  The concert is orchestrated in a way that personalizes everyone on stage as well as the listener.  Thank You
B008Y212PI|3.0|So far it has been way too easy. Also, it is making me review it to unlock more of the game. Not cool.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|On kindle fire the moose game wont work because I think it doesn't have multitouch. If you could, make an update that allows to get rid of it like the plane game. Otherwise its great.
0756686970|4.0|My boys love this book. They are avid fans of Star Wars, and are four and six. It gives a biography of the characters, and provides a challenge for young readers.  The binding on the book is a rad flimsy, which is why I gave it four stars. It is still read daily in our house, and we've had it almost six months, and my youngest falls asleep with it at night. Overall, if you have avid young fans of Star Wars Legos, this foes not disappoint
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game banana I have  ever played I could play uhh it all day it's that good everyone should play it it's so fun to play
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I have to say this is by far the best Deftones album I've heard. They progress with each album. And Chino reflects everything that goes on in my life.
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|I love this DVD, glad to have found on Amazon along with many other live tour DVDs.  What an entertainer, and beautiful voice, man and friend!  He was a original and enjoyed the tours and audience.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Love this show!! Great DVD's. An awesome way to enjoy my favorite show anytime I want. :) I highly recommend it!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This Angry Bird Space is a lot of fun. Without much effort anyone can learn and remember the moves to insure a win. I spend hours intertained by this app. Relaxes me and takes my mind away from troubles. Anyone who enjoys the first Angry Birds will certainly get a kick out of this game.
B00CEK9OTM|1.0|After hours trying to beat one of the advanced  levels, when I finally make it to the exit the game froze and now I will have to start that level again and waste my time on something I have already done.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love the game but wish there was an explanation about how things work? What are dozer dollars? How do the bonuses work? What's the puzzle all about? Help!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I am always searching for photo editing apps because i will find one that has a few good qualities but not everything I need. So until now, I've had 3 or 4 photo editing apps installed on my kindle at a time just to get what I want. Not anymore.<br /><br />This app is amazing. There are 5 different settings just to CROP your image, let alone the multitude of filters, tweaks, overlays, stickers, borders, and more. I could play with my photos for hours on here and still feel like I haven't totally explored all the possibilities in this app. Do you like to draw? This app is for you. How about making collages out of your photos? Get this app! There's so much you can do on here that put this app stars above the others. And it's FREE!<br /><br />Why are you still reading reviews?? Get this app NOW!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really fun its easy to get money and easy to complete goals. Its a great &quot;time&quot; game and you dont need internet to play. I love it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A definite must read for any woman in Corporate America and especially for those working in a male dominated field.  Great life examples and recommendations.
B000FA675C|5.0|Once you start reading you won't want to stop. This is one of the best, if not the best quest story I have ever read... You dive into a world of symbols and history, adventure and suspense like never before.
B005J7K964|5.0|If you read reviews like I do you look at the point spread.  How many five stars versus how many one stars.  There are a lot of 5 stars and then the next peak is the one stars.  Most of the one stars try to compare this to the 2003 release with no mention of the sound track. First off the latest update of this movie produced in 2003 is longer and is more complete, but that is because newly found parts were added that were not available at the time this was made.  Second, if you are a purest and want to be as close to the original as possible buy the 2003 edition.  If you want a really good update with a great sound track buy this one.  My wife won't watch the 2003 edition but she will watch this one for the sound track.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|I loved the book. It gives you a refreshing reminder about what free market and capitalism are. Also more insight into what is the relation between economy and politics. Great read.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Hurry up Season Three. I've got to know what happens next. This series is just as enjoyable as the scifi and fantasy books I've read.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|JAWSOME! I love the doctor and the dalek. This was an excellent series, I will be watching it again. Tardis!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love it! Need to know what happens next. I've been watching the series on weekends, so that I have the time to savor it like a good meal.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|If you are a person that is constantly finishing book after book than this app will amaze you! There are so many choices of good reads that you couldn't possibly get through them all! I am so excited about finding this app that I have shared with everyone I know! I downloaded it three days ago and I have already downloaded eight books...for FREE!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I love this I use it with my Zoom H1, only issue is there is no lights to tell u when its on and sometimes i forget to click it on also there is no light to tell u if its dead or dying; otherwise is great for the price!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book, asking with Under the Dome and 11/22/63, are the epitome of what makes Stephen King one of my favorite authors to read. I actually quit reading his books quite a few years ago, disappointed with titles such as Cell, and figured well, the man has written a lot of books, his great idea barometer must be broken by now. What a fool I was. Doctor Sleep is a fast paced, well written, thoroughly enjoyable ride through the adult life of Daniel Torrance. For those of you who've never read the Shining, and only seen the movie, there are bits you won't quite understand, but for the rest of us, we were allowed to say hello to an old friend, as I like to think of my favorite books of old, while getting to know the adult that young Dan grew into. I was crushingly disappointed to learn Dan has become an alcoholic like his father, and heart warmingly encouraged when he joins AA. So many characters in this book are likable, and the story itself was so engrossing I hardly put my Kindle HD down for 2 days. For any readers who may be skeptical to pick up Stephen King because they've been let down in the recent past, go ahead, take the chance, and buy this book. You won't be sorry! Vintage Stephen King.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for all ages! Get it or you won't know what you're missing! Especially if you like Temple Run! I love the Minions, spool cute.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Even though it showed that it came with captioning when I rented it - when we watched it it wouldn't work. Very disappointing.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book is great funny it's one of the best books I have ever read this book is awesome get it.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I loved the movie but have to say I was really disappointed that though it said it came in closed caption - I couldn't get the captioning to work on the movie. I tried everything. It showed up on my computer when I viewed it there but not on the TV. The captioning is always on for the TV so it wasn't that. Very disappointing for my mom (hard of hearing) and brother (deaf) who were watching it with me. :(
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has SWAG! It's really fun and easy yay! You should get it this app is fun for kids over 9 or ten
B003TH14H4|5.0|I downloaded Season 1 and Season 2 on my Kindle Fire.  It is wonderful.  I did this so I could watch them while I am at the gym.  I sit there and watch an episode and it makes the time go by very fast.  In fact, I now do longer sessions because of this show.  I am enjoying the show and I also enjoy the exercise.  It is definitely a win-win situation for me.  Listening to music is good too, but this is so much better.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great movie.I will recommended to everyone who like futuristic movies and may you feel the intrigue about our small planet in the universe
B001B1T7BU|5.0|My family enjoyed this movie which is a more modern version. It has basically the same story line but up to date.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Amazon has the nasty habit of stopping apps from running unless you are logged into your Amazon account. It is annoying and frustrating to be wanting to hear something like a sporting event quickly only to lose time for not being logged in at that moment.<br /><br />This is a great app! It gets 5 stars without Amazon's ridiculous requirement that you be logged into your Amazon account.  Get it from the PlayStore.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Tears laughter and passionate love. Who could ask for more! Turkey amazing ans a flood read for anyone who would love to be in love!
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Before the final season I would have recommended Dexter to someone with the caveat that it went downhill after season 4. After watching the final season, I would no longer recommend Dexter to anyone... unless I really hated that person.<br /><br />Read reviews for the final season online. Go to forums and see what fans had to say. I don't know of any other show that took such a nosedive in quality. It wasn't just the finale that was awful, the entire final season was embarrassingly cringe-worthy.<br /><br />The final season is a meandering bore. The writing is horrible. The plot lines are offensively stupid.  Plots are contrived, illogical, and completely defy common sense. It's as though they're deliberately trying to insult your intelligence.<br /><br />Instead of spending $200+ on this box set, take your money and flush it down the toilet. You'll get more entertainment and feel less insulted.
B00DL47RQ2|5.0|I went to see this twice already, probably would not be understood by the young (under 25 or so). Is one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen. I would be very surprised if Cate Blanchett does not win an Oscar for this.  Cannot wait to get it on DVD.  Steve
B004LWZW24|2.0|Overall, not as good as I had hoped for.  If you've seen \\"Poltergeist\\" and/or \\"Paranormal Activity\\" this movie has elements of both.<br />The story follows a family who has just moved into a new house and starts experiencing strange occurrences (a story line that has been used way too many times, imo).  Then one of their son's falls into a coma, for no apparent reason.  Bring in the psychic stage left.<br />Honestly, I would have stopped this movie after 15 minutes in, but I wanted to see where it was going.  Finally stopped it after an hour and 15 minutes.  I didn't care about the ending, and I really should have been on the end of my seat wanting to see the ending.<br />So, the story wasn't all that great, it lacked uniqueness and depth.  The characters were not that compelling either, and therefore the acting wasn't all that intense (and it should have been based on the scenario they were put into).  The directing, also, was a little ho-hum for a scary intense movie, like this should have been.  Establishing shots are really just boring, in my opinion.<br />I look to issues with the directing, and mostly, the writing. It needed to be a better story.<br />I wouldn't buy this for my collection, nor would I watch it again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|&agrave;<br />I love this game it is so much fun I just love it I will play it every day
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|Great fun read, Bridget bumbling along, struggling like most of us to be perfect. Getting away with more things than she should - good on her.
0440423228|5.0|The characters and the scene plots of the book are being followed better than the TV Series.<br /><br />(( Para os Brasileiros, a entrega pela Iparcel &eacute; sensacional, não vem nem uma pontinha amaçada ))
0805091742|4.0|Like his other books, a well written discussion of what medicine might learn from other professions.  I am a big fan of Dr. Gawande's writing and was not disappointed by this read.
0545265355|5.0|The box, the books and the cover are really beautiful. I have just read the first one, and I can tell that the story is quite good.<br /><br />(( Para os brasileiros, a qualidade de transporte da amazon junto com a Iparcel é incrível, pode comprar sem medo algum! ))
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great show, Great audio and video, great show and did I mention it is a great show? If you likje Zep, you need to own this

B008RKIACK|4.0|The Warriors, all I can say that this is a cult movie classic that I can see over & over again!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So much action in Season 3 - I stay up until all hours in anticipation of what is to come next.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love My Alarm Clock, I use it as my alarm clock, appointment and reminder of all my events. Plus I also like that it give me my weather.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love watching this show! It is one of the bright spots that I look forward to watching every week.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I think we have all wondered what our lives might have been had one slight change of fate taken us down a different path.  This book takes you there, if you let it.  It definitely should resonate with the 40+ busy family sect as it did with me.  I enjoyed it.  It really made me think about how different my life could have been had I made different decisions, and not necessarily for the better...This is a fast read, kept me involved and engaged.
B00ET47USI|4.0|This game is pretty much like one I have played on my computer. It is designed to be a little more challenging than regular solitaire, and it is.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its really fun to play, and it works anywhere; no internet connection needed, which i thought was great because i'm always bored during car rides.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I freaking love this game it is so much fun just freaking adore and love a cherish this game love it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The alarm works just fine, it has many settings to personalize it. Multiple noises to use to wake you up, you can ajust the brightness and volume too
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's okay the only problem that I have is when it updates I have to go to the app store and update it manually.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|Many songs to choose from, it has a self-scrolling bar so that was extrememly helpful. Really happy for the price :D
B00FN811SY|5.0|It's so great to have an app to read the Bible on the go. We can always have access to this great information.
B005HSL626|5.0|You don't need an internet connection to play, so that was great. It has multiple games so you can't get bored, you constantly unlock new features. I really like it
B00594XOZU|3.0|works really good but I would love it so much more if you update it? Please?  And I'll make it 5 stars like it deserves.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Its really fun to play, although it is the same mini games over again. The only difference is that you have to complete them faster and faster, which makes it more fun
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|I have been looking for a boxing game and this is it. I hope they update it. I recommend it
B00F56AZK4|4.0|the app gave you a couple of free puzzles, but you needed to upgrade or whatever to gain/unlock more puzzles
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|This is a version of &#34;Bob, the Street Cat&#34; modified for youngsters. The tale of this young man and his cat is enthralling and heart-warming, and a great message for kids.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Damian has done it again managed to take us on a great adventure including Adolf Hitler of all people!<br />Like the last book the action scenes are top notch and not over the top but you get a great sense of it as if watching it unfold before you. As well as setting the tone and scene just as well hope he keeps writing these and we keep swapping for honest reviews as i enjoy these files so much.
B008EL25LE|4.0|I love Azkend, and this is basically a different story behind almost the same game. I personally prefer the details of the way the original is set up to the newer version, but this one is also very enjoyable.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Very well written book with a good deal of information. My wife and enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it to the spiritual person who needs assistance.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|All three Quell games are outstanding. They require application of planning and thought, not just reflexes. The concept of the basic Quell game is simple, but the games are enthralling and kept me coming back again and again.
B00008QSA5|4.0|Everyone knows this LP.In my world Mike Bloomfield is the star of this gig. Unbeliveable guitar playing plus bonus tracks which includes one outake with Mike playing more blues.What more could you ask for?
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I've played this game repeatedly. It's kind of addictive. I love the basic game play, and the talismans you earn are very satisfying. I love seeing bits of that screen bow up LOL! Not so the fond of the &#34;match bits of this picture&#34; interludes, but they are easy, so you can zip through them quickly and get back to blowing up tiles ;^)
B00BXKKNFS|3.0|Doesn't always blocks ads, sometimes keeps me from signing into websites, and ever since I downloaded this I sometimes lose connection to the internet and given a proxy error.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I got this at the same time I got Treasures of Montezuma 2. They are very similar, and I love both of them. The visual and sound effects of this one are great--it's very satisfying when those fireballs explode the screen LOL! I go back and play both of these games with some frequency.
0140544518|5.0|I have read this book to hundreds of children. Whomever gave this story a single star probably didn't even finish reading the book. Great illustrations. Excellent parody on the three little pigs story. Great job!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time almost by chance. Then I bought the BluRay and watched it about a dozen times. Then I bought the sound track to listen to in my car. The message is--if you like music, especially a capella music, this movie is addictive. And if you don't know whether you like a capella music, watch this movie and you will by the time you are finished.<br /><br />This movie has a great deal beyond the music to offer. The story is charming, and although in a way it's very predictable, the path through the tale is immense fun. The characters are delightful and quirky. And watching Audra attempt to mold her new crew of diverse and... unusual... new singers into a clone of the previous version of the Barden Bellas is hilarious. The phrase &#34;herding cats&#34;  applies nicely.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|the game looks great but it says I need more space I hope that amazon fixes this because I want it
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Love this movie. It's high action and exciting, but it's satisfying on other levels as well. As the first Star Trek movie in this new franchise tells the tale of Kirk's personal growth into &#34;hero&#34; status, this one is really Spock's.<br /><br />A movie to watch over and over.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Amazing clarity! I think many scenes were better on my tv than in the cinema. Since the  older versions were digitally remastered. It doesn't quite have the same effect in some scenes but for the most part, some scenes of just extreme detail will take your breath away and make you fall in love with the saga all over again
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I love the Iron Man movies. IM I was my favorite, until I saw this one. This movie is really more about Tony Stark than about Iron Man. Or more accurately, it's about Tony Stark coming to terms with just who Iron Man is. It begins with a man who is pretty badly unsettled by the events of The Avengers. He fought beside demi-gods and truly enhanced humans, and he describes himself as &#34;a man in a can.&#34; This movie is about him finding the worth of Tony Stark.<br /><br />Oh, and Pepper gets to kick butt ;^)
B00FHAM3Q2|5.0|Truly talented, multi-faceted, enigmatic.  She sounds like Rihanna on some songs, Ke$ha on one, Florence on another and is totally Miley on all!
B009FXIICK|3.0|I enjoy match-three games, and this one is okay. Other than the cute little tiles, there's nothing particular to distinguish this one.
B002A9THA8|4.0|I chose this rating because I thought the nudity wasn't really necessary but it was a very good movie overall.  I liked the actors and the movie plot.  I would recommend it to adults but not young adults due to the nudity.<br />I liked the acting and thought the movie was good.
B00FITRTQ6|5.0|After getting to know Chase Williams in the short stories of \\"Cutting Right to the Chase\\", I was looking forward to seeing this character dealing with a real case, with a complex story, to find out how he would fare. Our Chase in this \\"Into the Killer Sphere\\" (another title with a double meaning, which in itself is a small masterpiece) finds himself before the classic murder that took place in the context of a rich family, whose members, without exception, seem to be the suspects, because of their ambiguous behaviour and for the fact that they can benefit in some way from the death their relative. Yet it's all very bizarre, starting with how the victim is dead, and actually the story focuses much more on the \\"how\\" than on the \\"who\\", which at some point can be understood by an especially careful reader.<br />Chase with his awkward manners, which maybe bring the suspects to underestimate him (another element of classic detective stories), however, conceals a unique insight in following the traces, even the most insignificant ones, and coming to a solution, whilst the reader is unable to stand behind his reasoning, only to be caught by surprise with the final revelation. The reader would never come to it, although it was all in front of their eyes, as in the tradition of the great detective stories.<br />Congratulations to Stefania, this Sardinian Agatha Christie who follows admirably the tracks of this great writer and, I am sure, will make us live yet many fun adventures on the streets of Tursenia.<br /><br />Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of [[ASIN:B00L979374 Red Desert - Point of No Return]]
B00005J9PB|4.0|Well obviously the movie it's self is terrific. The only issue with the actual DVD is that it's a German version and doesn't fit most regular DVD players. Luckily my MacBook can adapt to that . Should say it before you buy it though
0321543726|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone learning or needing a refresher on C++. I use this book on a weekly bases.
6305428522|5.0|The film gives a perfectly detailed feeling for the 1950's from the start--cars, soundtrack, costumes, houses, the attitudes of the 50's.  You'll viscerally remember sticking to your grandmother's plastic covered best furniture.  The pacing is fast and never drags.<br /><br />The cast of the movie is great--Ralph Fiennes (Charles van Doren) is perfect; Rob Morrow (Dick Goodwin, who investigates the wrongdoing) plays off him ideally, and the versatile John Turturro is terrific as the unlikeable but sympathetic Herb Stempel.  Robert Redford is probably a better director than actor, and that's saying  a lot. Martin Scorsese, another idol, also makes brief but scalding appearances.<br /><br />In any description of the movie you'd be told it's about the quiz show scandals of the 1950's.  On another level, it's about the stigma of being too smart.  When Charles van Doren and Mark Goodwin cast off a small sailboat into a tame lake, Charles remarks, \\"Remember when being smart was like being cross-eyed?\\"<br /><br />While I was too young to remember much about the quiz show scandals, I do remember the worshipful attitude schoolchildren and teachers had towards the Van Doren family, especially in northwestern CT, where I grew up and they lived.  They were America's first family of poetry.<br /><br />The forces that ultimately end up destroying those with any integrity in the movie are complex and many.  No good guy wins; might triumphs right.  But the carefully nuanced portrayal of those who are pitched into parting with their values, piece by piece, and end up losing everything is a masterpiece.<br /><br />For the record, the establishment of higher learning that is portrayed as Columbia U (my alma mater) is actually Fordham University, the Jesuit University of NYC, possibly an even more gorgeous campus, where my daughter attends school.  In the central Bronx, lest you get the idea that borough is a vast wasteland as depicted in \\"Bonfire of the Vanities.\\"<br /><br />This is a movie one can watch over and over again.  Highly recommended.movie one can watch over and over again.  Highly recommended.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Product is well engineered and well made.  Works as expected.  Not sure how much one can say about a plug in power port for the car, other than it has a quality feel to it unlike some other cheapo models I have owned.  The 18 page instruction manual was a bit ridiculous...really??? 18 pages to instruct me to plug it into a cigarette lighter?????????????  Other than the flagrant waste of paper I recommend this car charger.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|Worked out great for me. Bought this for my sons 2year old birthday since me and his mother are separated. Didnt have an issue with the audio not playing. As long as your in a well lit area the recordings should work flawlessly.

0393327655|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys rational arguments based on factual evidence.  Harris is intellectually riveting  like no author I have encountered before.  The book is well-researched and provides unparalleled reasoning against the concept of faith.<br /><br />My favorite quote:  &#34;Reason is nothing less than the guardian of love&#34; (p. 190)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one if the saddest, but beautiful books.  I finished with tears streaming down my face.  Thank you John Green.
B00EXVZW6E|3.0|I like the seek and find games with a story behind it better.  The difficulty was average.  I'm glad I got it as the free app of the day because i would not typically spend my money on this.
B00634GHJA|1.0|I cannot make it work.  I have installed it on both my kindle and my computer--the little picture appears on both, but I cannot make my computer cough up the photos and transfer them to the kindle.  I haven't tried the other way as I don't take pictures with my kindle.  I have contacted Amazon and they tried to be helpful and contacted the supplier, but none of either one's suggestions worked.  It seems like a great idea if only it would work.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This was an excellent movie with a teriffic cast. The story moved along at  good pace with enough twists and turns to keep your interest. You cared about these people and hoped they would find their happy endings. A wonderful film. Highly recommend it.
B003RV43X4|5.0|Having loved the rather cheesy original I was a little hesitant about watching this.  As it turns out I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a fun and enjoyable remake that any fan of the original and the genre should enjoy.  This film delves quite a bit deeper into the characters and the mythology than the original did and does it quite well.  The only downside I can find is that I wanted to see more screen time for \\"The Kraken.\\"
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Seriously, this is about the worst movie of 2013.  It makes Oblivion (haven't we seen this before), Iron Man 3 (what happened to Iron Man?) and After Earth (don't let your kids star in your films) look good in comparison.  Like others have said, there were no characters that you cared about in this movie - everyone was spouting cliché's and attitude and playing their formulaic role to a tee.  The most disappointing thing was that if you expected to see some sort of interesting illusions or magic tricks, you will see nothing.  Just lots of lousy CGI.<br /><br />For those other folks who are frustrated because they paid for the film but Amazon streaming is not working for them, well, I think you are better off.  You may have lost $5.00, but at least you did not lose two hours of your life to this pathetic film.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I was already sold on JJ Abrams after he did his first Star Trek film and this was a phenomenal addition to the series.  If you don't like this movie, something is wrong with you...  Great character development, fantastic story line, and amazing special effects make this one of my favorite Star Trek films of all time.  The only thing I could say about it that is even remotely negative is the chase towards the end of the movie drags out a bit and becomes a little lame and predictable.  I hope JJ Abrams does at least 2 or 3 more of these!
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Love the game wood play it all day if my girlfriend would let me like the game a lot try it you will love the storyline
B005LJITS0|5.0|I skipped this when it was in the theater thinking it looked lame.  Turns out this is a fun, entertaining, good old fashioned comic book hero flick.  I screwed up by not seeing it on the big screen...  I hope they do a part II for this!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Buy the game it's fun u can set it up the way you want to play as long as you want
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This is a highly underrated film!  I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I rented this, I was just bored and it looked interesting.  This turned out to be an awesome movie!  Lots of good action, a very interesting and surprising story line, and a great hero to get behind as the plot develops.

B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Gross and I hate the short story format. Unless you want to be grossed out, donot read. Nothing like the Shining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really great read.  Had me on the edge of my seat and I loved how the author led you into the mysteries unfolding.  Getting ready to read Loosing Hope.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|Used this along with several other part to build our first computer together, I have done several in the early years of the PC so it was good to get back in the saddle with my son and build one together.
B005544V6A|5.0|I didn't have any preconceived ideas about this show and have been completely surprised at how much I love it.  Cathi
B00EQF2EIG|2.0|When I scanned the reviews, seeing things like \\"contemporary remake\\", I assumed the dialog would also be contemporary.<br /><br />If Shakespeare is your thing, go for it.<br />While I have read (and enjoyed) Shakespeare in the past it was not a quick read and I had to reread and look things up constantly, as our language has evolved significantly since the time it was written.<br /><br />I tried to watch this but ultimately just gave up only part way through as I had little idea what the actors were talking about.<br /><br />Maybe modern english subtitles?<br />This movie is probably great for English Lit. classes but really misses the mark for the masses.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|I love that this CD has old songs that make me nostalgic and new songs that I love as well.

B00E1L9N8E|5.0|Acting, sets, costumes, music excellent in this adaption. The party scenes tops in movie making history. Go see it today!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's ok - it's very descriptive, and glad I had this on my Kindle rather than a paperback. It's kind of a Cinderella tale, only with lots of sex.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its really fun and when you have lots of extra time this is a really fun time consumer really fun
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Fairly predictable, although this book was interesting because they traveled to different places, so that made things more interesting. More development on the characters - kind of.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Have to say this is the best app for an alarm clock.. works great, easy to use.. would recommend to anyone to use it
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This guy is inspiring like Dean Karnzes (spelling?) and it shows that it takes work, commitment and they were willing to go the distance to do it.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought it for my daughter. She is a avid Dr. Who watcher. She loved it. It was just what she wanted.
B0015DWJ8W|3.0|It's a little long on words but not too bad for someone who wants a little more intellectual running book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ah, I can't believe it's over but loved the ending! Left with a calm, reflective image to carry with you.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|You can tell that this series has one thing in mind - sex. That's all the books are about, basically, and if you're looking for an erotic read, you've found the series.

0205313426|5.0|There is a good reason this little book has been around forever - it is unbelievably useful.  It's a great resource for checking things out in a hurry.  You don't need to wade through tons of unrelated information, but can go straight to what you need.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Excellent book, enjoyed reading it and notion of flowers conveying an underlying message.  Tough reading about foster children.  Redemption motif was a draw
1421550644|5.0|This book was in brand new condition. It arrived on time and we couldn't be happier. It was a gift I'm sure will be greatly cherrished.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Though a little cumbersome at first the game really gets the noggin thinking.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read it and re-read it. I have shared them and I also have it on audio book. Great read and love story!!!
B005LAIIGW|5.0|*I Enjoyed the Simple Story. People Complain that the story was 'clich&eacute; and unoriginal'. It's about 2 people trying to survive in space. And it did that job (and story) very well. A Simple Story is not a bad thing. To me, a lot of films lately have had 'overly complicated stories' that drag the film down to the depths of Cinematic Hell. It was nice to see a very Simple Story told very Effectively.<br /><br />*Very Well Acted. People say 'there is nothing to the characters' or 'there are no characters'. Sorry but I disagree with those people. I saw two of them, played very well by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. And I'm sorry, but I didn't want them stopping every 10 minutes to pontificate about God or The Universe. It's them trying to survive by themselves and trying to figure out how to do that. By the way, someone said that this was quote 'Clooney's worst performance'? Really? I would have picked Batman & Robin for that...<br /><br />*The FX are Beautiful.<br /><br />*The Score fit the film very well like a glove.<br /><br />*Intense, satisfying, and not overly long (like the usual 2 to 2 1/2 hour flicks that normally come out).<br /><br />*Great 3D.<br /><br />*Excellent Film, and without a doubt my favorite film of the year.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|This is very slow reading.  I am on the third book and the story line has yet to progress to anything interesting.
B009LDD22U|5.0|This was a gift for my son to add to his collection with seasons 1-5. I talked to him and was told he already watched the complete DVD. He is completely satisfied.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I really enjoyed it and can't wait til season 3 comes out.  This is one series that I can get my husband to watch with me.  Not sure how long that will last but we'll see.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. I kept wanting to read more and stayed up way to late!
B005LAIIN0|3.0|The film starts out nicely with panic in the streets. We have to wait like everyone else to find what the problem is. Soon our potential fuzzy-faced hero will have to make a moral decision. It looks like the world is at \\"steak.\\"<br />We chew our fingernails as the plot thickens. Is there no way out?<br /><br />I enjoyed the distraction of the movie and the few predictable twists and turns. There was nothing spectacular or extraordinary in the presentation. The DVD extras showed the producers were proud that they displayed the bitees as a virus with one purpose to spread and survive; at one time this may have been a new idea. In this day and age everyone portrays virus strewn people as vicious vectors.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's newest book describes a number of thought-provoking scenarios of underdogs and others who have turned potential problems (e.g.) dyslexia into adaptations that have enhanced their success.  Probably the most interesting aspect of the book discussed the problems with mass incarceration in the US and the US dependency on punishment alone to deal with crime.  Gladwell quotes Todd Clear, a prominent criminologist, and describes briefly Dr. Clear's  work over the years in attempting to lower prison populations while enhancing public safety.<br /><br />Gladwell, as usual, is a great storyteller who makes his points using a combination of anecdotes and research.  Highly recommended.

0770437400|5.0|Pretty fun, it's a bunch of short snippets from different points of view - so there really isn't any character development.  Also some of the characters are kind of unbelievable.  But still a lot of fun.  If the idea of a Zombie Apocalypse book does not turn you off, check this one out.<br /><br />I do have one technical complaint:<br /><br />The author claims that main battle tanks were mostly useless against a zombie horde, because they only carried like 30 rounds of armor piercing ammo.<br /><br />Did nobody ever play \\"Command and Conquer?\\"  A 65-ton main battle tank traveling at 45 MPH would be the most awesomest weapon against a zombie horde imaginable!<br /><br />SQUISH!<br /><br />Seriously.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Great band, great set, very good price -- nuff said! -- Guess not, needs 10 more words after 'nuff said' - I think that counts as irony
B0061PEAUY|4.0|It was easy to pick this book.  My husband and both love the Bones TV  show and I have been trying to get some of Kathy Reich's books. Voila my wonderful husband got me a Kindle Fire for Christmas. That made it very easy to get books. I was extremely happy for this present. I was very glad I did not have to leave the house to get books by one of my authors. Loved the book.<br />We just bought  season eight of the Bones series and I can hardly wait t o dig in to the wonderful Soup that is Kathy Reich's signature.
0786948523|3.0|This rule set is based more for table top role players and selling D&D miniatures! I think there trying to sell out and make money! At the heart of old fashioned role play games is the cheap start up cost to play. This is not the case after reading the rule it lends to heavily to needing miniatures to play and miniature mean more money to spend! As a hole game if your just starting in RPGs and have the money buy it! But there are far more better role play games out their and there cheaper!
034544678X|1.0|At the time of purchase, I had a puppy & wanted/needed advice on a variety of subjects. This was not the book for quick answers. If you enjoy stories & leisurely reading, it will be fine. If however, you need quick answers & reference material, go elsewhere.

B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I was so excited to see this book in the pipeline - I followed on Hosseini on Good Reads and Twitter and pre-ordered this book.  I loved his previous offerings, but, when the book came, I found myself avoiding reading it - nervous it wouldn't live up to my own expectations. Well I was wrong. Hosseini's such a fantastic storyteller. It's like having your granddad on the sofa with you lulling you into a fantastical world as an innocent child. I love the way he can transport his reader to lands often only seen through the sad coverage in the press and the way he writes with such colour and passion.  This wasn't my favourite of his books.  I think I found there to be one two many perspectives (with the story being told from multiple narrators) but overall a wonderful read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|So much better than the series, but with the series i can put a face to the character. Do not miss out on reading these books!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great show.  Took a chance to look at the first episode then couldnt stop watching. Had to buy the last season to get caught up
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is definitely one that pulls at the heart strings. While it was sad it was well written and compelling.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Incredible how this movie was made. Worth every penny to buy it on BR.  Watch &#34;the making of oblivion&#34; in extras menu. Minimal CGI used in filming. Love it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr sleep was very well written and has an endearing cast of characters. Only problem for me was that it fell short on horror. I wanted to be scared to death as I was with the shining, but it never happened. I need a really good old fashioned horror story from Mr. King. Soon!
0385349947|4.0|I like the book, it is very easy read.  I definitely took some recommendations from it to my career life.
1451695195|5.0|Great book!! Fascinating read. I am grateful that a doctor was willing to tell his personal story as many in medicine are so sure that the body is all there is. I hope this book encourages them to broaden their life view.
1603427244|5.0|I have used this book many times since it landed on my doorstep.  This is a collection of CO & BO's that can turn a simple sock into a very special sock.  Who knew there were so many ways to do these completely necessary parts of your project...what ever it is.  LOVE this book
B009DP9D6A|5.0|Love Deadmau5 and all of his music and for the price I got here on amazon compared to itunes was blown out of the park!
B00008NRI7|5.0|Both actors are at their very best for this comedy of a tree huger enviormentalist who is also a Harvard Grad lawyer and Grant as the front man for his huge corporation she opposes.  He needs her to work for him and with her great comedic talent and his lost in the big picture comedic charm they work great together.  I can't believe someone out there by now has not seen this but it is truly a great comedy.
0767853636|5.0|I have seen Annie many, many times in my life, but never owned it until now! The price was just too good to pass up and this is a classic!!! I love all the characters! I love the songs and the feeling you get watching this movie, it just makes you happy!!! Thank you so much for offering this movie so that I could own a piece of history!!! :-)
B009ZQJ0ME|2.0|Take the move the Matrix and make it even worse! Confusing, silly plot, and just not believable in any sense of the word.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|If you like period pieces, this is every bit as historically insightful and sentimental as anything Jane Austen could produce.
B003BWERF8|5.0|All perfect, it works exactly as promised, even with my old ipod. You can buy it without doubts, good product
039334505X|5.0|As always, I love Irvine Welsh's books.  This one was quite long, but there are many satisfying, hilarious and very memorable scenes.  Getting to read about the earlier adventures of the boys from Trainspotting and Porno felt like hanging out with old friends again.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Another good album by A Perfect Circle.  Not a bad song among the bunch.  Worth buying.  I'd definitely recommend it.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie is hilarious for the whole family it contains typical Adam Sandler humor that is safe for kids my kids still quote parts of the movie months after viewing and they always want to watch it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I. Loved. These. Books!  I read someplace, that E L James wanted to write a story that readers would fall in love with. Well, she did.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|This movie is the best and only one I can think of for a contrary view of the every day life of a zombie it has many knee slapping moments and some gore which is required for the genre plus a good love story too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it. It is very very fun but I wish I could play it with out WiFi. It is so much fun
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Every part of this movie is great the characters are hilarious the story line is combination real life and fantasy Scottish folk-lore and the score is very well done.
052118939X|3.0|Book is well organized. I'm international and I think it is good. Btw, delivery was little bit late. Only about book, I like it.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|The wife and I watched this movie and it is definitely a white knuckle zombie film the fact that my wife enjoyed it speaks volumes as she is hard to sell on zombie movies in general.  The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is a personal qualm with the zombies that run faster then Olympic athletes and move with super human speed and strength.
B00EBJ624O|5.0|Yuja Wang is for me one of the most exciting pianists on the concert stage today. She plays with such passion, energy, drive, and precision that whatever music she interprets just comes alive for the listener. This live recording of two great and challenging concertos is a clear reminder of her talent. The highlights, of course, are the amazing first movement cadenza of the Prokofiev 2nd, and the finale of the Rach-3. The sound quality on this disc is exceptional, the Simon Bolivar Orchestra sounds lush and commanding, and the piano crystal clear. I'll be playing this CD a lot for a long time.
B000SX6KHQ|5.0|This album is full of heavy beats and a very alternative type of music it's rhythmic catchy and is a must have for all Gorillaz fans!

B000FC12SM|5.0|Great insight and information.  Wish I had had this book when my wife and I first got married 33 years ago.
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|This is my review of the 4 CD + 1 DVD edition...<br /><br />DISCS 1 + 2: the first two discs comprise the very same Rock of Ages tracks released on the 2001 2CD edition (plus \\"Strawberry Wine\\" and \\"Smoke Signal\\" but minus \\"Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\\"), culled form 4 different nights (December 28th-31st), with different running order and a brand new mix.<br />The new Bob Clearmountain mix sounds great inasmuch it vastly enhances the performances of the five members of The Band. Their playing is allowed to truly stand out and is given new depth and detail. This is quite exciting, but on the other hand, the horn section is pushed in the background and mixed very low. On many tracks you'll have to strain your ears to catch the harmonies, the counterpoints and the obbligatos played by the horns, and in my opinion this is a wrong move because Allen Toussaint's arrangements were superb. My question is: since the whole point of those 1971 concerts was to play and record with a horn section, experimenting with Touissant's arrangements and some of the world's greatest horn players, why now mix it so low? Beats me. This is where, in my opinion, the Rock of Ages 2001 edition still sounds superior.<br /><br />DISCS 3 + 4: a \\"soundboard mix\\" of the whole New Year's Eve concert. 11 of these performances are the same performances included in Rock of Ages and in the first 2 CDs of this set. There are 16 previously unreleased performances (same songs, though).<br />This is a very basic mix, a bit flat and spiritless if I may say so, with vocals up-front and the instruments a bit jumbled together. Robertson & son (who apparently did the mix) have been quoted saying that this soundboard mix sounds like \\"a great bootleg\\". Right. But who needs a bootleg when 2 different professional multitrack mixes from these concerts are already available?<br />Discs 3 & 4 are a curio which I don't see myself playing a lot in the future, honest.<br /><br />THE DVD: mostly an audio DVD with the same performances on discs 1+2, presented with 5.1 surround sound. There are also two filmed performances of King Harvest and W.S. Walcott, apparently the only existing footage from those nights.<br />-<br />In a nutshell:<br />Discs 1+2 sound great but the horns are mixed very low, so in that respect the 2001 edition of Rock of Ages is still indispensable, possibly better if you liked the horn arrangements.<br />Discs 3+4 sound ok but are a rather nondescript addition.<br />DVD: if you care for surround sound you'll love this. Otherwise, you might as well go for the cheaper 2CD edition of this release, which discards the soundboard mix and the DVD and presents only the new Bob Clearmountain mix, which in my opinion (even with the reservations above) is the only thing of some interest here.<br />I'd give this set 3 and a half stars...e performances on discs 1+2, presented with 5.1 surround sound.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the story around an ordinary family.  I have often wondered what experiences the ordinary family would have during the Nazi time.  The character was interest and the bond that happens between the father and the character is precious.
1616550414|5.0|This is such a beautifully presented book, full of facts that would be appreciated by any Zelda fan. I'm not a crazy, rabid fan so I'm not sure exactly how much information in this book is new or previously unreleased, but it makes for an interesting casual read and it very pretty to look at.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This is the perfect product for anyone who got hooked on Smallville.  Whether you missed an episode or not, you're sure to find something you have forgotten about.  Plus it comes with lots of extra bonus features like the unaired episode of the Aquaman pilot.

B009B8YZKS|5.0|I've been wanting a Halo movie forever and if this was more of the final few scenes and less of the beginning filler I would have loved it more but even still this movie rocked. It's was a different move imaginative piece of internet video that made me watch every week to see the next 10 minute segment. I bought this digitally and the Blu-Ray. If you love Halo at all you will enjoy this short film.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun game to play occasionally (when stuck in traffic or in the waiting room). Some of the higher levels can be difficult!
B0000X61UU|4.0|This was one of the first workout DVD I ever bought.  It's very good for overall body conditioning, but doesn't include much cardio.  It's runs a bit long at just over an hour.  The visuals are nice (especially for the 90's); locations include a city loft and a studio set made to look like a desert.  (The locations in her first video were better, eg. a beach, a rooftop.)  The music is light pop (think Seal).<br /><br />Cindy Crawford doesn't always have the best form and sometimes she's self conscious.  Otherwise, this workout is an advanced body conditioning workout.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I really don't use this app very much (I keep up with Linked In on the PC) but it does work OK.
B005UVQ72Y|5.0|I went ahead and read this book right after 'Enders Game' and expected something similar... And found a much more sophisticated book. The difference has nothing to do with not centering around pre-teens. The language and the flow is entirely different. It reminds me very much of the cadence and style of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's '100 Years of Solitude', one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />the book is beautiful and amazing and will enter my all time favorites along '100 Years of Solitude', 'Dona Flor and Her 2 Husbands', 'The Idot', 'The Brothers Karamazov', 'The Master and Margarita'... And that says a lot, I have a list of sci-fi favorite books, but this one belongs to the mentioned instead. The storytelling is on that level and I am 100% sure he read those books.  Bulgakov, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Dostojevski etc, would probably call them 'piggies' and 'buggers' also for the people that question the useof those terms.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great 'list keeper' app that can be synced across multiple devices. Add something to the list on your PC and it automatically appears on the same list on your phone.

0307271609|5.0|The author of the remarkable Wild Swans turne her attention to the life of the Dowager Empress of China, Cixi  Originally installed in the Emperor's palace as a concubine, Cixi took advantage of circumstances to become the most powerful person in China.  This was at a time when women had little or no influence in State affairs and who were regarded as very much a man's appendage.  The virtues most highly prized in women were dignity, courteousness, graciousness, gentleness and modesty.  Significantly missing are any thoughts of intelligence, strength of character and perseverance.  These latter were qualities possessed to the highest degree by Cixi.<br /><br />Over the course of the latter half of the nineteenth century, Cixi, manoeuvered her way through the labyrinthine politics and  social upheavals until she became the Dowager Empress.  She adroitly steered her course between bowing to the needs of the traditionalists whilst beginning the long and difficult process of modernizing China.<br /><br />Cixi's life is generally known the West, if at all, through the sometimes less than accurate writings if her enemies.  As is customary in the canon if much Western literature she is also viewed from the perspective of her contacts with and effects upon European and Japanese interests.  Consequently this detailed story of her life is, to this reviewer,<br />extremely fresh and revealing.<br /><br />I recommend this biography unreservedly to anyone with an interest in the development of China politically and socially.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|so might as well enjoy it ya know??<br />Besides, my girlfriend still haven't seen this movie so now i can bombard her with it all day
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Great book explaining very complex theories in fairly accessible language.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning why something that seemingly makes no sense, is not only plausible, but necessary in scientific terms.  Lawrence Krauss is a great ambassador of science to the general public.

B00CJGP116|5.0|Love Marc Anthony's voice. I waited a long time for him to come out with a new album! Well worth the wait.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|After reading the NYT excerpt, I was eager to read The Circle. I was not disappointed. Eggers has clearly laid out the totalitarian technological future and the present nonchalant attitude as we rush into it, mostly uncaring of our government's invasion of our privacy rights. We have hounded the whistleblower who exposed the real &#34;Circle&#34; to Russia and the NAS continues to sweep up all communications. Eggers portrays how eagerly millions of people see nothing but benefits when the world has no secrets and no privacy, when all information is captured. Chillingly, the last scene is the idea that perhaps a person's thoughts can also be captured. Orwell, we are here.
0307591549|4.0|Achor gives compelling reasons that demonstrate the importance of positivity and happiness in the workplace.  They lead to more productivity, less distractions, less stress and greater job satisfaction.  He shows how contagious emotions, both positive and negative ones are, and gives example after example of how to generate more good feelings and good will around you.  His work isn't original, nor does he pretend it to be.  He gives credit where due and that is admirable.<br />I have incorporated one bit of advice and if I stay disciplined, it could change my life.  You can't see my desk thru all the papers upon it, some of which have been there for years.  I made up my mind to clear off a small bit each day.  Achor is right!  It feels so good and liberating.  I thought I would spend an hour sorting thru my stuff, and it would up being three hours and I can't want to work more tomorrow. I can already see how my desk will look in ten days.  Then the areas in my bedroom by my nightstand, and then the kitchen. I know I will be a much happier person when I put everything in it's proper place, or in the trash.<br />I have some issues with some of his principles however.  For example, he talks about \\"the Zorro Circle\\" where people have reachable goals that are achievable, and that keep expanding to more difficult challenges.  I have always believed that when someone achieves a goal, the aim wasn't high enough to begin with.  If you aim to bring in many more sales, for example, than you possibly can, I would bet you'd do better than you would have, had you set a goal you achieved.  I've always told my kids that when negotiating for a salary, that you'll never get more than you ask for, and that if they don't think highly enough of themselves to ask for whatever amount, then why should anyone else think they're worth it.<br />There is much to learn and to think about in this book.  You also might want to listen to Achor's TED talk.  I find him to be a much more effective speaker than writer, and would love to attend one of his sessions.eaker than writer, and would love to attend one of his sessions.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|The movie is very inspirational. Tom Hanks does a superb job. It ingeniously ties in history with Gump's life.The old songs are really enjoyable.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Honestly, it was so poorly constructed and repetitive I found it challenging to get through. I'm a fan of this type of book, but this is a sad byproduct of twilight inspired novels. Not worth it.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my nephew for his birthday.  Like me, he is a fan of the series and asked for this.
B00902MCVY|5.0|This disc contains the best epic metal I have ever heard.  Ever.  It's made it to elite \\"desert island album\\" status for me.  The guitars are heavy.  The orchestrations are lush.  The riffs are crushing.  Jari's voice summons the infinite depths of time itself into his vocal chords.<br /><br />It's best to remove any preconceptions about this work.  It's the band's second album... but it's not very much like the first... it's only half an album... so what?  The true worth of an album is in how much of it you listen to long-term.  For me that's basically all of it, though I usually skip the first track since it just delays our arrival at the awesomeness of Sons of Winter and Stars... and after that it's a metal symphony in all the best connotations of the phrase.<br /><br />Roughly one year after release I'm still listening to Time I with regularity.  It just has that \\"it\\" that comes along only very rarely.  Jari and co. struck gold - celebrate with them and buy this album.  You won't be disappointed.  Catch them live if you can; they're amazing!

B002KJX4IE|5.0|I loved this movie as a teenager and now as a parent.  Michael Keaton did a phenomenal job as Beetlejuice and stole every scene he was in.  Good fun, but wouldn't recommend for anyone under 10.
076244911X|5.0|I'm not a fashionista by any stretch of the imagination, but I am a big fan of Kylie and have always admired how gorgeous she looks in her videos, on magazine covers, etc.  Kylie Fashion compiles photos of her in her most iconic and beautiful atire and lets you know who designed the clothes and other details that die-hard Kylie fans like myself will find super interesting.  Even if you're not a Kylie fan, I think fashion junkies in general would fall in love with this book.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Have been a Robert Downey Jr fan for a long time.  Loved him as Sherlock and also Iron Man series.  His movies always have humor sprinkled in them, keeping them enjoyable.  Now that Stark has had that thing in his chest removed, does that mean there will be no Iron Man 4?
0345803485|1.0|Anne Rice, under her noms de plume of A. N. Roquelaure and Anne Rampling, did a much deeper - and better - series of erotica with BDSM colorings.  Personally, I could never understand how so many adults got involved in the Harry Potter series, as that writing was weak.  Then came \\"Twilight\\".  Now this.  Says volumes on the pitiful state of our declining intelligence.

B008JFUO4U|3.0|The special effects were well done . The plot line is a Little thin and you won't understand the movie until the end. Tom Cruise carries the movie.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This reminded soooo much of the old Twilight Zone series.  Crouch did a great job in creating that atmosphere that grabs you and won't let go until you get to the bottom of what's really going on.  Eerie and frightening, I found myself rooting for Ethan as he tried to escape this waking nightmare He found himself in, and hold onto his sanity.  Can't wait to see what happens next in Wayward, the next book in the series!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great series, great book. Frustrating cliffhangers since the sixth book isn't out, but isn't that how it always is with these longer and amazing book series?

1609611543|4.0|Dr. Davis writes in great detail about the unhealthy consequences of eating processed foods made with modern-day wheat. I think it took less than the first quarter of the book to convince me to try his wheat-free way of eating.  Now two months past that decision, I am amazed to find not only don't I miss all the bread, cookies, bagles, donuts, cakes, etc., that I used to love and almost addictively indulged in, but the change in my diet has had a significant favorable impact on various health issues I had. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it was a bit too technical to actually enjoy reading it, but it definitely is worth the effort.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is liking reading one gigantic tome on the Kindle. I really liked it that way. All the extra stuff around the novels are there (maps, acknowledgements, listings of houses, etc.) but you can just jump right into the next book by turning the page. I never tried to jump around to specific books or parts of books, so I really can't comment on that. I just bought it and started reading (I am new to the series).<br /><br />As for the series, like so many others, I was hooked very quickly. Can't wait for the sixth book...
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This is always at the front of his carousel, so i know he's been playing it. He laughs and woo hoo's the enitre time. He is six, so he usually calls me if there is an ad during a game, so either there are no ads or they are easy to cancel. Thumbs up. Five stars.

B000GG4Y32|4.0|Like Dances With Wolves and Braveheart, this movie shares the distinction of being directed by its star. And, like Citizen Kane - another title directed by its star, Reds represents the zenith of the actor's career. Orson Welles never again approached the greatness of Citizen Kane. Likewise, Reds is Warren Beatty's crowning achievement, a spectacular production involving multiple locations and hundreds if not thousands of extras - and he co-wrote, directed and produced as well as played the starring role. Whatever deal Beatty struck with Paramount Studios to make the movie, he got what he needed, because he evidently spared no expense to bring the critical events in the life of the story's central characters to the screen. Those characters, Jack Reed (Beatty) and Louise Bryant (Diane Keaton), were American radical journalists covering the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, which began in 1917. In Reed's case, the coverage escalated to include complete involvement in the cause. Communism became his obsession, and Beatty conveys Reed's passion and determination to help the cause succeed - however misguided it appears through the lens of history.<br /><br />At three hours-plus, Reds qualifies as an epic. But it's an episodic narrative. Its many, many scenes move along rapidly, as though we pop in and out of moments in Reed's and Bryant's lives. Their relationship develops rapidly, too. At first she's married to a dentist in Portland, Oregon. Then, all of a sudden, she's left her husband to join Reed in Greenwich Village. Then, she's engaging in an affair with playwright Eugene O'Neill (Jack Nicholson) and heading to France to cover the war. Then, Reed is battling for control of the National Socialist Party and heading to Russia to win the support of the Bolsheviks.  And so on. Yet Beatty's skilled enough as a director to keep things coherent. He also employs an interesting device to provide both respites from the story's breathless pace and background information about the times and the characters: the comments of 31 \\"Witnesses,\\" people - some of them well-known - who knew Reed and Bryant. But Beatty goofs, I think, by not identifying them on camera.<br /><br />Beatty's reputation over the years has been based primarily on his romantic escapades. But here he shows true and serious talent and a devotion to an unusual character embroiled in a tumultuous time in history. It's a respectable effort and well worth a look.

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|\\"Mud\\" is amazing.<br /><br />It's the story of how two 14-year-old boys--Ellis and Neckbone--help Mud in his quest to avoid the law and regain his lost love, Juniper.<br /><br />But it's really the story of how love is always imperiled, lost, renewed, deepened.  It's a coming-of-age story for Ellis, but it's also a growing-up story for Mud, the 35-year-old.<br /><br />Everything works.  The intense hand-to-mouth Arkansas scenery, the timeless overpowering Mississippi River, the wonderful naturalistic acting, the terse and powerful script, roles that fit seamlessly together and reflect each other: Mud, his father-figure (Sam Shepard), Ellis and his father reflected in Mud, Neckbone and his father-figure uncle, Ellis's mother who reflects his questionable girlfriend, Juniper and her questionable relation to Mud, etc.<br /><br />The story is suspenseful and powerful and unpredictable.<br /><br />It's like an update of Huckleberry Finn: the helpless, ceaseless, intense struggle for freedom, the unending resourcefulness and optimism of a boy's point of view, which, amazingly, triumphs.<br /><br />The overall feel of the movie is like \\"Winter's Bone,\\" but this is a very much brighter and warmer film, filled with quixotic hope that manages to transform a small world.

B00AZRBLHO|4.0|IT and business people should read this book. It oversimplifies a lot of monstrous challenges, but it clearly shows how important IT is to a business. I find it intriguing that the VP of Ops is leading the charge. The renaissance activities sound like Enterprise Architecture.  But most organizations have trouble delivering this type of value via EA. The point, though, is that everyone must collaborate to save a business.

B008JFUOVI|4.0|The movie was not great. There were at least 2 animal death scenes, which I  didn't like at all, and the movies wasn't as funny as the previous two. I don't regret watching it, but it's like the atmosphere is gone. Also it's important to mention that Zach Galifianakis wasn't too 'excited' to be in the third movie, meaning that at least one of the actors got nearly fed up or just tired of it all. Well, the ending after credits was priceless, like a happy ending, sort of. But there will be no part 4, sadly. I wish this movie was a little (at least a little ), different.. better.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Still reading it, but so far its among one of my top 2 books of this series. Best books I have ever read great story and plot.

B009PMEEY2|4.0|The only flaw I found while playing was that sometimes it would take me back to places I had already been so I had to really look at the map before I proceeded.  Occupies my time!
B00992CF6W|3.0|message to MANGO STUDIOS.Here is just a hint that MINECRAFT POCET EDISHION is a but glichey when it is night monsters arnt out.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I like this album better than the original release in 1970. I literally own every album he has ever done. He's the BEST!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|So i think that the book is ok but they ned more conversations and stuff like that they also should make you feel the story
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|Very helpful for me to understand the technology, the players and what I should plan to be succesful.  Sometimes repetitive.  But not a big deal.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|What  great album, Candice is so HOT, she does such a great job. Love all of Blackmore's Night albums. Glad I bought it.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|I read earlier reviews and even though its an inapp purchase game its very fun..I recommend playing it a few times and get used 2 it..playing it on a kindle fire is very fun<br />I will buy this app and I recommend it
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|After I watched this I realized that I had seen it on TV not that long ago but not 3D. Well the 3D was not very good and not much different than what I saw on TV. Just OK.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Cuts through glass so evenly! I've never done this before and it made it to where there was not much thought process involved. :)
080701429X|5.0|This was a great book really enjoyed it! Thanks for having it at a great price! awesome awesome awesome!!! must read
B003O86FMW|4.0|I didn't read the first book, but I saw the movie. the second book needs the background the first story provides. I am buying the third one for my kindle right now!
B00B3YDOGO|5.0|Recommended by our library book club. Had a little trouble in the beginning with the way the chapters jumped from person to person, however, when I figured out the &#34;gist&#34; of the plot, I decided it was one of the most unusual and interesting books I've ever read. A little disappointed with the ending, but it really couldn't have gone any other way!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Seems it started slow, could do without the sex, doesn't seem to add to the story, or make it better
0061950726|5.0|I didn't know much about this subject. I found the story enlightening and interesting. I loved learning about the times these children lived in and the troubles they had to overcome through no fault of their own. Christina Baker Kline writes in a storyteller's style and from the beginning, I felt as if she were telling me the story in person. I like books that take the reader back and forth in time. This is a must read if you are interested in the orphans who were relocated from the east to the mid west.
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|Thank goodness I went the Kindle route.  Once the battles begin, I could skim large sections and still not miss anything relevant.  If this wasn't the last in the series I would have put the book down half way through and just walked away.  Like many other reviewers, very sad to see a series that spanned decades end this way.  All too often this last book was literally painful to read due to the tedious, never ending battles.
B00004VVND|5.0|This is a classic western/horror movie. They do not make movies like this anymore. And it has great stars as well. A unique concept and well-acted throughout. Highly recommended.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|More ups and downs in these folks' lives than the stock market!  Great Period soap opera.<br />I Recommend to everyone.
159562015X|2.0|You'll get an access code to the test when you buy the book, which is really all you need. You get a little bit more from the book, but not by much. I would generally just recommend buying the test ($10).
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This movie is a parody and well done. funny stuff. I liked it a lot and you will too watch it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I like it ., it gives me a chance to see  things  all over the world & learn how people from diferent country's stay in touch
B003YL4LYI|4.0|It was a pulling together of many threads running through &#34;The Game of Thrones&#34;. Some were clipped short, others hinted at games yet to come.  The tension between Ice and Fire takes no prisoners. You will either be grateful you live a life of comfort and ease or dream of joining the fray.
B00002N9ER|5.0|These worked exactly like I wanted them to mount my mag light in my truck. They seem very sturdy,  I have pulled the flash light out and put it back in multiple times and it looks like the brackets will hold up for years to come.
B008JFUNNM|5.0|\\"Captain Phillips\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The film focuses on the relationship between the Alabama's commanding officer, Captain Richard Phillips and his Somali counterpart, Muse. Set on an incontrovertible collision course off the coast of Somalia, both men will find themselves paying the human toll for economic forces outside of their control.<br /><br />The cast led by Tom Hanks (in a Oscar-worthy, well-crafted performance as Captain Phillips) & Barkhad Abdi (in a star-making performance as Muse) is brilliant. The directing by Paul Greengrass is brilliant. The screenplay (based upon the book \\"A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea\\" by Richard Phillips & Stephan Talty) by Billy Ray is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Henry Jackman is brilliant. The cinematography by Barry Ackroyd is brilliant. The film editing by Christopher Rouse (who also co-produced) is brilliant. The casting by Francine Maisler is brilliant. The production design by Paul Kirby is brilliant. The art direction by Charlo Dalli, Raymond Pumilia, Paul Richards & Su Whitaker is brilliant. The set decoration by Dominic Capon, Larry Dias & Corey Hughes-Shaw, set dressings by Maxwell Britton, Brian Buckley, Rachel Burgio, Jonathan Champoux, Christopher Conroy, Keith S. Jackson, Wayne Kimball, Jeffrey Schneider & Doug Scott is brilliant. The costume design by Mark Bridges is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Brian Ricci & Caius Man is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Sara Emack, Judith Gericke & Lisa Kelly, supervised by Charlie Noble & Adam Rowland is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Rob Inch is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant, well-crafted, well-made action drama / thriller that is entertaining and intriguing. Tom Hanks gives an awards-worthy performance (also one of his best performances in years) as Captain Phillips & Barkhad Abdi is superb in a star-making performance as the head pirate, Muse. Paul Greengrass has directed another terrific and well-crafted film, as well as another well-made & well-done true to life story adapted to film, that is just as powerful as his \\"United 93\\" was. This is one of the best movies of the year and of the fall season, as well. This is also another film that definitely has awards consideration to it, Oscar-worthy, included in the conversation, as well.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|New update is absolutely horrible I constantly get kicked off . It's way to hard to get the dragons now as well . Fix it or I will delete and that's tragic because it's one of the only games I like .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great.  Nice to see a TV show where everything isn't graphically violent or where everything doen't have a sexual inuendo.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|My hubby and I loved the movie. We watched the unrated cut. The only thing we didn't like was we rented it and we wished we would have purchased it. I'm going to buy it for him for Christmas.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've had a great time playing this game it is very addictive great game. My grand kids can play it for hours and not get bored.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My entire bookclub group, gave it 5 stars -that's how we start the meeting.  So interesting that it is written from the perspective of Alice.  The author did a tremendous amount of research.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Yup it's official I am done with the series and I loved it. I loved Christian he is so mercurial as Ana says.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Follett is a wonderful storyteller--I love his books and the many lives he weaves together with history that most of us didn't learn in school.  Bravo!!
B00E7SFAAG|2.0|Wasn't great but wasn't bad either.  I found Granny hard to manipulate and could have used a better tutorials on the controls
B004DLPXAO|5.0|so far it does what it supposed to do so i like it. so i was hoping if the search and find functions would be improve as to have favorite channel/tab where i can mark the book i like instead. also i bought an audio book hopping i could use kindle for it but it dint work. is there plan for it? also i hope there a funtion where i can just 1 click download all my book. cause i have to clicking each book after a fone change or format fone is well tired some since i have around few 100 book.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|I am in awe! I have not had the honor of reading such fun and entertaining literature in a long, long time! Do carry on,do! I for one, am waiting on baited breath for more. God's blessing to and yours. Again, thank you!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|What I have been able to use I like.  Will know more later.  I expect to use and like it very much.
B005544V6A|5.0|Superb show. Refreshing. Fast paced. Witty. Entertaining.<br />Great acting. Brilliant editing and wonderful acting by the entire cast make it stand out!
B0030B624E|5.0|I love this movie. It is hilarious, well written, well acted, and well, it's just, a really quality flick on all points. It's not terribly scary, though there are some suspenseful portions and even some poignant spots too. I don't know how often I've watched it, but I'll never ever ever get sick of it. It is just so, so, good.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|GoT season 2 does not disappoint. Full of action, violence, death, and sex. Shocking plot twists. Super Exciting. Highly recommended!.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This is a lovely movie and there are many versions to date. I just really love how Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan pull this classic to a whole new level. I feel so inspired when I watch it and James Horner composes the most beautiful sounds to my ears. I bought the movie because I want to be able to be inspired when I need a boost! Thank you so much!
B005FLANHE|1.0|It was a different region dvd, that did not work in my player. I didn't see anything that clearly stated that. I am unable to play this.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|This movie is amazing.. Great for the holidays. Great for all ages. Would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I think this is the one movie that Will Ferrel does that is right up his alley!<br />This was a great transaction... fast shipping, great price and in great shape!
B001EC2IT4|5.0|This movie is a childhood favorite that I still truly love as an adult. It's funny and Gothic and wonderful. Plus, now I'm old enough to recognize how completely smokin' Alec Baldwin was in 1988. (I was 3, and did not yet appreciate his adorability. I was too busy running into walls and drooling about other, more important, matters.) Tim Burton was in his prime here. :)
B00BCX2F66|4.0|I get almost as many comments on the case as I do the phone. Quality is good, the flip part does show a crease, but it is necessary for the stand. The case holds well, protects decently (not an otter box obviously), and does not detract from the aesthetics of the phone. The only downsides are one handed operation is little harder due to needing to open the case first and it would be nice to be able to stand in portrait and landscape positions, but this is only landscape capable.<br /><br />I would buy this case again, and feel like it will last a while. I have been using it for two weeks.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|I have been trying to find some decent headphones without having to take out a payday loan at the same time to get them. These are very nice around the entire ear so you don't have that pinching like some over the ear headphones. Once on, the music flows without interruption from any outside noises. Very clear sound with sharp highs and great bass. Would recommend over the over-hyped Dr. Dredd headphones which are just a marketing ploy and not nearly as nice as these. Come with a bag, and 1/4&#34; screw on adapter. The line does not disconnect from the headset itself which is just a minor point. Very well put together. As with all headphones it depends on what you like. For over the ear, these are great and better than the more expensive music mogul knockoffs that everyone seems to be getting just to say they have beats. Would recommend to anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I purchased this app for my Kindle as I was tired of having to look for one.  This is very handy and helpful as I have not experienced any freezing up or inconsistencies with calculations.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|i am starting my blu-ray collection and when i saw the price on this i couldn't pass it up.  couldn't find a better price out there.  these are great movies and they look great in blu-ray.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I found this game to be challenging but it took too long to reach each new level &amp; a ridiculous amount of time to satisfy the quests. The only way to move swiftly through this game is to spend money an buy crystals.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this book! What a great sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34;! Lots of twists and turns and surprises! Just sad that it's over because I get attached to the characters. Please write more Stephen...please???
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved the entire story from beginning to end.  I could not wait for my 4 a.m. reading slot to arrive each morning so I could follow the story to its next phase. I truly enjoyed the final chapters as you tied all the disparate aspects into place. Thank you for re-igniting in me a desire to get and read the next chapter in a saga.<br /><br />Very very well done.
B008MAI0WK|4.0|The book sheds light on just fine backgrounds. The book is clear and provides many practical tips. It was good deal!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This app is fun funny great cool and everyone loves to play and watch others play it. I got this originally for my ten and six year old sisters but found myself enjoying a level often. I would lend my kindle fire to my friends and they would play this app and loved it.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I love this CD by CHER. I just LOVE Cher. She is amazing. I went to see her a few years ago & would go again if she came to my area. This is a terrific CD by CHER.<br />Yes I would reccommend it to everyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Smooth game play on phone and tablet. Great graphics. You can customize your cards. Minimal ads. Can't believe it's free.
B001BANK32|3.0|after reading a seeing the &#34;under the dome&#34; I was very disappointed with sk.  &#34;under the dome&#34;  doesnt have enough plot to be more then one season.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Disappointing game - freezes way to often - several times a day! Also if you need to purchase bingo tokens & you try to make that purchase, you do not get them! Customer support can only be emailed & they do not resolve the issues. Weekly updates take time away from game & they aren't beta tested  containing too many errors & do not make we, the customers, happy. Buffalo Studios should be more customer friendly & have phone access to quickly resolve all issues.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My son loved it at first but it does not have all of the options that the original game has.
B00C6Q3UNK|5.0|This review is written on behalf of my four year old...<br /><br />\\"Draculaura is an awesome ghoul friend.  Her best friends are Howleen, Clawdeen, Frankie and Skelita.  The cups are awesome parts.\\"
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|I purchased this prior to going to their latest concert. I had all the previous music and wanted to be familiar with the touring stuff. They lost their long-time keyboardist but created a new twist on the familiar Sigur Ros style. More driving beat and rhythm.  Excellent.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It is not often that the second season of a show is as good as the first, but Suits beats the odds. The writers were up to the task and the actors turned it up a notch also. Suits is definitely one of the best shows on television!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I had a difficult time finding the right settings but after tweaking I thoroughly enjoyed the product and went about decimating my gaming opponents. The extra keys were perfectly placed
B00DJ6KYWQ|5.0|A 5 star yarn that has been thoroughly researched, I enjoyed it immensely. A good present for the man in your life.

B00DV2D0JC|5.0|This game includes the perfect amount of HO games and is set up perfectly. You don't have to search the entire layout to find what your looking for and the clues are enough to help you go where you need to. The game lasted a long time which was really nice. I love the creators of this game. I can't wait for more of them to become available for Kindle.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful book. I have read this series 3 times and it's still great!! A wonderful and well written fantasy. I can't wait for the movie!!
B008602KQI|2.0|Ok movie. Weird concept between a 1800s civilation and a futuristic civilization. However the whole premise of having kids fight for their lives is kind of repulsing.
B000AHJJDM|5.0|Great record, sounds great, works great.  havnt had any issues.  would recommend to any death cab fans or the like.
B0000931QR|5.0|This is my first cd from la oreja de van gogh and i could not have made a better decision. Love Amaia's sweet delicate voice. I strongly recommend it
B0038M2AZA|5.0|. hey listen to the book on tape and the first three minutes I was captivated by the movie cuz it was so close to the book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love that Pam Grout refers to God, the Universe, All-That-Is (or whatever name you would like to use), as the Field of Infinite Possibilities.  Imagine knowing, as a child, that this Field of Infinite Possibilities was always ready and willing to bring to you whatever you wanted to be, do or have.  A Field of Infinite Love for each of us, always available.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|They have never let me down, and this CD is no different. Love Kings of Leon. What talent. Please keep making music!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I think it is so fun it's like running your own business .  You get to be creative and make it how ever you want it. It also has a great system you communicate with the neighbors an  have goals. There's a lot of ideas and themes you can choose from. I've even seen adults on it. It's great I recommend it for everyone !!!<br /><br />  Great job Team Lava !!!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Wish it would work on my old kindle don't have the new one<br /> Cant believe I wasted my money on this
B000024L5R|5.0|I play this CD in my car so often, I wish I had gotten the autorip version (I learnt that you have to purchase thru amazon only to get it) so I could have download and listen to my fav hits on my laptop.  But truly amazing, My fav is 'River deep mountain hill'  Excellent work Celine.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I bought this album and wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, but after I opened the CD and put it in my old broken down car stereo, my car magically turned into a Ferrari! No lie, by the second song \\"We Can't Stop\\" my acne cleared up and my voice deepened, my junk got larger and women started noticing me. By the song \\"Wrecking Ball\\" I had intercourse with over 427 woman, no lie! And by the end of the CD I got a call from THE top Fashion Media Agents to be the next Supermodel for life! My life has become what I always wanted it to be! And to make things even better I bought \\"The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee\\" from Amazon and have since won the Nobel Peace Prize! I carry this CD with me where ever I go, children look up to me (probably because they are small) and all people from all around the World have become friends and the whole World has united into one. This CD not only changed me, but it changed the World into a better place! Unfortunately the US Government is still shutdown, because they haven't listened to the CD yet.
B0006LZPLM|5.0|These sandals are awesome. I tried some of the Newport H2's but the sizing on those is all over the place and I had to send three different pairs back. I had a pair that almost fit but still didn't feel right. I traded them in on a pair of the original Newports a half size larger than my normal size and they fit great and feel great on my feet. I feel these are a much better product than the H2's.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I wouldn't recommend it for  very young kids, it has some intense moments in it, but for the rest of us, it's worth the time to watch it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great Reacher story, keeps your interest, knows his history, good memory, doesn't  get the girl, etc. Knows what he has to do to win.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the early levels are easy but still great when you just want to calm your mind down from your days activities.  the water sounds are perfect and the higher levels are both challenging and satisfying - not to mention addictive.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|The zombies were awesome -really scary!  I think the story line could have been better though.  It was kind of obvious what was going to happen during most of the movie.  I liked it...
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Well written book that gives you enough insight into flying helicopters that you really get an appreciation of what these guys fought against just to do their jobs. Hats off to Mr Mason!!
B009P1WES6|3.0|This book is, as many have said, a page-turner. It reminds me of those TV Scandinavian TV serials where what happens at the end of an episode make you want to watch the next one immediately.  But I found the plot unrealistic and the characters rather contrived and even stereotypical. As it unwound it became more and more predictable, and I knew how it would end. For complete escapism it is fine and reasonably enjoyable.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is an entertaining movie with an ending that made me smile.  It's a bit like a puzzle wrapped in an enigma...sort of.  I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Please play this game because it is the best game ever to be made. My whole family plays it and so should you..........
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This was a good movie. I love good science fiction movies and this one did not disappoint me. Not the greatest but ok movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Every episode is SO GOOD!  I watched the first episode out of curiosity and have been hooked ever since! Working on season three....
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I'll say up front that there was very little chance that I wouldn't love this movie. Much Ado is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, and I've loved everything Joss Whedon has ever written or directed, so it surprised no one that I loved this film. I was a little surprised at how MUCH I loved it though. Even with my high expectations, this movie managed to surpass them. According to the commentaries, several cast members had never done Shakespeare before. It doesn't show, at all. The performances are great. Nathan Fillion supposedly tried to back out, twice, because he was so nervous about his ability to play Shakespeare, but his Dogberry is one of the highlights of the movie. I was shocked when I looked Jillian Morgese (who plays Hero) up on IMDB and discovered her only other credit was as an extra in The Avengers. She certainly doesn't seem like she's new to acting or to film. Whedon's adaptation does a fantastic job of going beyond the text without changing it. Silent moments, sight gags, little bits of facial expression and physicality add new twists and dimensions, or clarify character motivations that are not inherent to the dialogue. For people who have trouble with understanding the language, this is an exceptionally accessible version. I know several people who were hesitant to watch it because of the language and they were able to follow the story and get the jokes without a problem. I've seen a lot of people complain about the black & white, the modern dress, etc. These things were largely budgetary concerns. Personally, I find the obviously low budget nature of the film adds to its charm. The fact that the entire thing was shot in 12 days at Joss Whedon's own house is nothing short of impressive. I also recommend the commentary tracks on the blu ray. One is Joss Whedon, alone, and it's very interesting and informative. In the other, Joss is joined by most of the cast, and that one is harder to follow, with so many people talking and laughing at once, but it's also very funny. It's unlikely, but I dearly hope that Whedon and company produce more cheap Shakespeare adaptations, because this is one of the best movies I've seen in years.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love minion rush! Almost as much as my kids. Sometimes it doesn't seem like it recognizes my touch. Other then that is great. Although my phone did an update and everything is decorated for Halloween but not on my kindle.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Although the camera work is below Hollywood standards, I found the story line to be interesting enough to keep my attention.  There is a lot of music in it which I enjoyed.<br />It's more than a music video, but does seem sometimes to be one.  That said, I liked it and found the ending to be a good one.
B00AIBZM40|2.0|Director of this movie is Guillermo Del Torro.  The first movie made by him I saw was Pan's Labyrinth.  I saw it in the movies several years ago and it was first film in years that made me cry.  It was also a film that made this director famous.  He definitely deserves status of one of the most talented directors.  Soon aferwards he directed one of the Harry Potter movies (the scariest one of them all).  Surely, when I saw his new film \\"Mama\\" in my local library I had to check it out.<br /><br />This is a film about two young girls whose parents die.  They spend years living in abandoned cottage in the mountains and once they are found everyone is surprised how they managed to survive.  They barely speak, do not walk normally and are intensively protective of each other.  Their only living relative, their father's brother and his live-in girlfriend decide to take care of them and help them adjust to the normal life.<br /><br />But, something if off.  Girls are traumatized and their strange behavior seems to be over the top at times.  As it turns out they have a protector they call Mama who will go to any extreme, no matter how evil to keep girls to herself.  Her love is so jealous that no one is allowed close to girls she considers her own.  I will leave it at this.  You can watch the movie and be the judge of it yourself.  Film has many amazing special effects and scary moments.  But as a fan, I must admit that it is far cry from \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\".  Del Torro can do better.  Much better.
B005LAII12|5.0|Love the movie, some cruel jokes, not for children under 13 I think.  Very sad on the end but will be a happy ending.
B00E66C6L0|5.0|i love this movie, enjoy the sound track, and if you get the chance to, by all means go see this movie in the theater you will have the most fun time wha ha ha!
B002LE8D2K|5.0|Even though this ram is not on the Asrock z77 extreme 4 list of ram, it works. No bios update or anything.
B004YXE438|3.0|For a puzzle app, this is exactly what you'd expect. Nothing special, or innovative, and the interface is very simplistic.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|In the typical Star Trek vein, a lot of action, some humor and a simple but enjoyable story line.  If you like Star Trek, it's worth the rental.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|When ever I try to log in with my gameloft account, all I get is a read time out message, and then I can't do anything else. It's kind of stupid. If anyone could fix this, I would be grateful. But until this happens, PLAYERS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0811879542|5.0|This book is wonderful for children and adults.  I thought it was so much fun to see how each page changed with the direction given on the previous page.  This is wonderful for following directions and keeps kids attention.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very funny, fully descriptive. Jeff Kinney is one of my favorite authors. I like, love to write books. I'm only 11, but my classmates love to read them, and as a young writer it's important that I have some peers to look up to.
B00BAXFDLM|4.0|This book breaks new ground with its characters and plot. It was very enjoyable, but the writing style was occasionally difficult to engage with.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I enjoy the show Castle.  I love the dvd, because the re-runs on TNT leave out some parts for extra commercial time.  Nathan Fillion does a great job as Castle, and leads the cast beautifully through many fun, dramatic and entertaining stories.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I got this book for book club at the last minute. I read it in two days. I really didn't want to stop. The story is interesting and believable, and covers all the emotions you can feel. One worth reading.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Can watch this movie a million times it never gets old or boring....and I hate that Amazon requires a min of words for a review
B00BGI08GG|5.0|You do not have to be a fan of comic books or superheroes to watch this show. ARROW is one of my favorite dramas on TV!<br /><br />The box set is a perfect collection to have! Lots of bonus features and all three versions at your finger tips: blu ray, DVD and digital.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Best game  I have ever played on my mobile device I would definitely recommend that you play this game<br />From, Tyler M.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Regardless of your stance on comics/graphic novels. It is truly a piece of literary genius. In the time you've spent reading this review, you could've already started reading this work of art.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really like this series, but wasn't at all happy to find out it will be more than a trilogy. I think three books is plenty and these characters deserve a rest...
B00C1S945G|4.0|But still it seems to me that by now you could make so that the screen be full and get rid of those black bars on either side....um just sayin Scotty could do it !!!
B00E1LT41K|5.0|I was home sick with a horrible cough and happened upon The White Queen mini series On Demand.  I was captivated within the first 10 minutes.  The story drew me in like no other.  This time period is intriguing and disturbing at both the same time.  I loved the costumes, hair design and interior decorating and the accents of the actors was so pleasant.  I may just go ahead and read the books now.  I would definitely recommend this mini-series. Yes there is hope in TV after all!
B0083ZBW2Y|2.0|The book is alright, but it doesn't really have a plot, it's just a lot of events happening back to back. Even though it's short, it was a drag and took me much longer than I thought it would to finish.
0545615402|5.0|Even though I have the previous book-set of these three, I just couldn't resist getting this. Almost like night and day when it comes to the quality! I am a very happy Potterhead.
B00FRG58TK|4.0|I had heard about this show, so I decided to rent the first episode. I had no idea what it was about.<br /><br />Major smile when I found out it was a Joss Whedon series about S.H.I.E.L.D.<br /><br />Another smile, Agent Phil Coulson is back! It's great to see Clark Gregg back in this role. It would have been a major disappointment to see any other actor playing Coulson. Gregg brings a certain \\"coolness\\" to the roll with his style of humor and devlish smirk. He also gets a flying Corvette.<br /><br />The first three episodes have been fun to watch. The team is coming together nicely with some neat gadgets and interesting stories. We also get to see some Whedon alumni, such as J. August Richards and Ron Glass.<br /><br />This show has some major potential. I hope ABC gives Whedon/show a chance.<br /><br />With Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., \\"Once Upon A Time In Wonderland\\" and Once Upon A Time, ABC has my attention for at least three hours a week now.<br /><br />4 stars for media is a really good rating from me. This show will have to get really, really good to deserve 5 stars.<br /><br />♦Season one review♦<br />The show is near the end of the season. I purchased a season pass and have watched all the shows at least twice. Although I really like the program I was hoping for more superhero type stuff. I want to see people with more special powers. All the characters are becoming nicely defined except Grant Ward. Skye's character is getting more interesting especially after the Jan 14/Seeds episode. I am glad the story behind Coulson's death is getting more time. And what about this Clairvoyant?<br /><br />ABC needs to give us more Clark Gregg humor. He is one of the wittiest 'one liners' on TV. We need more Kung Fu fighting from May. Fitz&Simmons need more involvement and more secret agent gadgets. Skye needs a neat super power. And please....more character development with Grant(yall are totally ignoring him).<br /><br />As I said, I really like the show but ABC could be doing A LOT MORE with it. It is just hanging in there with 4 stars but if ABC wants to bring it to \\"Once Upon A Time\\" level/5 star status, ABC needs to beef it up in season two.BC could be doing A LOT MORE with it. It is just hanging in there with 4 stars but if ABC wants to bring it to \\"Once Upon A Time\\" level/5 star status, ABC needs to beef it up in season two.
B008D28HYS|4.0|A highly addictive game that challenges the mind on a few different level. I just wish the controls worked better. I get frustrated when it won't let me color the squares the way I want without hassle. Other then that, it is a wonderful game to play.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very simple, easy to do experiments with astounding results! Plus, it provided new ways of thought for me to consider. I will be telling everyone to read it so I have people to form a group with!  Great read!!!
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|The device was sent to me from somewhere in the US. It arrived less than 48 hours after I placed the order. It was well packed, and easy to set up. There is a learning-curve in its use. It is very reliant on a free program called &#34;Scan Tailor&#34;. It doesn't say so in the manual, but there is an authorised video which explains how to use the Ipevo Ziggi-HD Document Camera, and which says that you need &#34;Scan Tailor&#34; to produce perfect straight and un-warped images of the pages of a book. My hobby is scanning nineteenth century novels and processing them so that I can send them as digital eBooks, to Project Gutenberg, where they are available for free to anyone anywhere in the world, provided they are out of copyright in their country's laws. I have used the Ziggi to scan five books now. It is quicker and easier than any other scanning device that I possess. I would recommend it for its price and the quality of its output to anyone who is involved with scanning books and documents. Its price is substantially less than that of any other similar camera device that I have considered. So far I have not come across anything to do with this device that would make me regret buying it. I understand that you could use it in a Skype phone call, but I haven't tried that, though I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work. I have recommended it to several people.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really love this game, I play on my kindle fire<br />Does anyone know how to do the updates???<br /> The only problem with this game you are limited to the habitats you can have with spending gems, and most dragons costs of gems are so high, very hard to get them without spending \\"real\\" money!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Really fun and challenging.  Like to create different procedures to see how to best meet the demands of customers.  Love kitty cafe it is additive.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|2-2.5 stars<br /><br />BTH, I'm not sure why this book is such a big deal. Maybe it's because it's the first book like this to hit main stream and most people don't know where to find the better books...I don't know. I will say that this isn't a normal BDSM relationship in this story. I've read a lot of BDSM stories in the past and to me, this book seems like something that would do better for newbies to BDSM.<br /><br />Anna is a college student that's just graduating. She seems nice but is one of those heroines that apparently is gorgeous but doesn't know it and puts herself down constantly (at least in her head and she has a constant running monologue up there). Also, she has never had a boyfriend before and had never met a man she was attracted to in that way (can we say V-bomb?). This changes when she ends up interviewing Christian Grey for her school newspaper and finds herself very attracted to him.<br /><br />Christian is an interesting character. He's in to BDSM but not because he's a Dom by inclination, he's a Dom by need. He was adopted but during his early years (before the adoption) he had a crack whore mother and a very bad life that left him with issues. His formative sexual years weren't normal either and he's never had a vanilla encounter in his life. I liked Christian but he's really messed up.<br /><br />Anna and Christian meet and Christian warns Anna off a few times. Regardless of his warnings, he keeps running in to her and they end up starting something. Anna is rather freaked about the BDSM aspect of things but she wants to be with Christian. When he finds out just how innocent she is, Christian doesn't take her straight in to the playroom. They start things kind of slow in deference to her lack of knowledge. There actually isn't a huge amount of time spent in the playroom, it's a bit light on true kink as Christian mostly needs to punish (although there is some bondage and such).<br /><br />Basically most of the story is the back and forth of Anna and Christian trying to figure out their relationship. Anna isn't thrilled about the BDSM part of his wants but is willing to talk about things because she really wants Christian. Christian tries to get her to sign a contract but since she's so inexperienced they end up having to go through a lot of discussions and disagreements while figuring everything out. Anna isn't thrilled about the limitations of a strictly BDSM relationship and tries to push for more. Christian finds he can't just let Anna go and tries to give her more. While you can tell that Christian cares for Anna, and is willing to compromise to keep her with him, he still has his needs and they don't really match with Anna's. She can't accept what he needs and in the end the story leaves off with a major cliffhanger and them split up and both hurting.<br /><br />This story was so angst filled yet immature at times. The relationship between Anna and Christian was tough and full of pain and need. In some ways I could see how the story could have been good but mostly Anna ruined it for me. Anna acted more like she was 16 rather than 21 years old. Her constant monologue in her head was very annoying at times and she said stuff like &#34;Oh My!&#34; so many times it was ridiculous (and that's not touching on her &#34;inner goddess&#34;). Anna was so wishy washy...just when I thought she'd gotten her head on straight and she'd be off on a tangent in her head again. I think with a better heroine I might have liked it more.<br /><br />Overall, my thoughts on this book is...Meh... It did end in a cliffhanger but I really can't see trying to go on with the series. It was tough enough to finish this one and I have no interest in trying to wade through the other 2.<br /><br />* note - I listened to the audio version of this book. The narrator did a passable job but not the best. I felt she read way to slow (I listened to it at x1.25 speed) and it felt like her narration just amplified the feeling of immaturity for Anna's character.
1439190976|4.0|This book documents well the beginnings and evolution of McKinsey as a consultaing firm: from providing generalist advise to clients on implementing the multi-divisional and conglomerate structures, from the 1940s to the 1970s, and later, changing its focus to knowledge-based and highly specialized consulting to business, government and other organizations from the 1980s onwards. The author points out the changing strategies but the relatively constant cultural values which drove them: an unrelenting and self-effacing devotion to client needs,selectivity in human resources and clientele, adaptability to changing demands, prizing teamwork over individual achievement, continuous culling of the workforce, and a capacity to bring rigorous analytic thinking to customer´s decision-making processes.  Side-effects of the company´s success have been a large dose of hubris, uber self-confidence and a penchant for seeing themselves as Masters of the Universe.<br />He also points out that McKinsey managed to deftly balance the two opposing facets of a professional service organization, which are to maintain the professional values of providing sound and objective advise to clients, and at the same time, ensure the economics of the business itself are optimized. This balance was seriously compromised during the 1990s and early noughties, when under the leadership of Rajat Gupta the firm shifted its focus in favor of more commercial goals, and growth at any cost. Quaity was compromised and discontent flowed within its ranks. According to McDonald, these aberrations have since been corrected, although management is still struggling to hone its vision of itself and its future.<br />Although any consulting firm with over 2,000 assignments/year is bound to have a few failures, the author stresses that in the case of McKinsey these have been egregious: tending to the needs of the iconic GM just before its demise, allowing itself to be caught up in the dot-com bubble, failing to foresee early on the importance of the internet, and indirectly contributing to the systemic real-estate and banking collapse, among others. These are big-picture events which one would expect such a large bevy of world-class thinkers should have foreseen or shied away from. Then there is the continuous nagging critique, especially from the European press, that a large portion of McKinsey´s bread-and-butter has come from helping CEOs justify downsizing, i.e. fire lots of people. But, the author concludes, this has not stopped McKinsey´s huge client base from continuing to hire its services, nor from it gaining new customers.<br />Even though he dedicates each chapter ot an individual theme, the author´s style is somewhat desultory: switching continuously from criticism to praise, from favorable quotes of journalists to unfavorable ones, from positive to negative anecdotes,etc. Yet, as th author suggests, this is a company hard to pin down, and this style makes the story juicy and more colorful.<br />In recent years McKinsey has had far more comptetition both for clients and for talent and in some surveys it does not always come out on top vs Arthur Andersen or BCG. ( But in this business, is being the biggest synonymous with being the best? does size matter? and if so, how ? to the benefit or the detriment of the client ? ). The author also observes that the company may not be so succesful in the \\"modern\\" world of the Internet, young entrepreneurs, technology firms and others not so inclined to hire the services of consultants. Yet,this whole book reveals that McKinsey has never had a serious problem with strategy or growth, and the author concludes that if it manages to retain its original strong culture as its own internal complexity grows, it will continue to succeed.<br />The reason why I gave four stars instead of five is because I feel the author needed to include a couple of examples of McKinsey´s work, showing their thought-process, procedure, their conclusions and recommendations. Perhaps this may not be possible, but if it is, it would definitely enhance a second edition.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and was saddened when it ended. Probably a pipe dream, but would love a follow up book!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Can't get enough of these well cast characters and interesting plot lines! You may not be able to stop once you sit down to watch episodes.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Good story that you think is about preteen angst but ends up as sometime else all together.<br /><br />Most of the book is the internal voice of the characters. Do not be disappointed when that does not translate well to the movie.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I loved this. Sophie always has a way of making you laugh out loud while reading her novels. I think this novel has movie potential.

B001AITH50|3.0|This is not a stylized love story or teen-aged angst ridden vampire flick. It depicts vampires exactly as we have been told for eons, they are monsters that kill people indiscriminately. The real great thing about the film is that it tells the story of vampires over the past hundred years or so.  It tells it from a human perspective told by a vampire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft for pocket edition. Awesome! The controls are a little iffy but oh well. Lots of items and I love it. I made this brick mansion and I invited my brother to see it . He is very impressed.

B001O1O71C|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter as it was on the assigned reading list for her school. I planned to review it to make sure it was suitable for her to read. It has changed me. The genius of writing from the perspective of a child softens the horror and outright evil of what was done at &#34;out-with&#34; as Bruno calls it.<br />The fact that his father could &#34;disconnect&#34; and do what he did during the day only to come home to a family at night is chilling to think of.<br />It is a book that everyone should read and important for young people that are consumed with the thoughts of iPads and game boys and hollister... Our kids need to understand about this so that it is never allowed to happen again... And yet it seems as though it is still possible even today..<br />We need to live our lives as fully and as meaningfully as we can each moment.. For we have no idea what tomorrow holds
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I like this game. It's very fun. I made a city using my ideas. One thing though, it glitches out a little. It does this thing that there is a flying bathtub thing. It's weird but cool at the same time. Sometimes a ride it.

B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Its very nice taking pictures and taking videos its a very nice app for kindle fire i recommend this to you guys to download this app.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Wow, i was hesitant to watch this judging by the other reviews, however, so glad my expectations were low because i loved this movie! 40 or the realization that your mind hasn't quite caught up with your body, is certainly troublesome for people. Yes, there are those that welcome it, but there are those that would pay money, give up first borns to avoid it! Don't judge us! But really, this was a fun movie, not an epic blockbuster, but i sincerely love Leslie Mann, and Paul Rudd was a great complement. Yes, the movie certainly exaggerated many instances in our lives, and i get that some people had a problem with that, but...it's a movie...that's what movies do.It's funny b/c its a crazy half truth. I could have done without the profanity...that's just not cool, especially when the daughter starts letting the F bombs fly. That took things a step too far, however again, it's rated R. So you kinda can't complain about it. I would never have seen this in the theater, but it was a fun Saturday night rental.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love how I have an account and can open it in any device that the app is downloaded on to.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is AWESOME. Graphics are outstanding. I'm very impressed. The thing is, it's WAY too repetitive . All you do is just buy and place creatures. It'll be so AWESOME if you add battling.
B0002B15XI|3.0|Although with the exception of the Characters Rader, none of the actors in this movie played their charactors in the tv series, this still what a good movie. A little more slap stick style comedy than the series
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|When I first bought it worked fine, but now 4 months later it stopped charging my kindle. I've also tried charging my sister's kindle on it but it won't.
030746363X|4.0|the book is good it is similar south beach diet. will give it a try and see what happens over next several months
B002VKE0XA|4.0|The found footage gimmick here works. It’s one of the few times that there’s an actual good reason for this movie to be filmed the way it is. Any other way and the suspension of disbelief wouldn’t exist.<br /><br />This movie delivers on chills. Certain scenes remain in my memory and I’ve watched this three times in the past 3 years. A horror classic.<br /><br />Not to spoil anything, but there are some gaps of logic on the characters’ parts. These flaws knock down the overall enjoyment factor a few notches.<br /><br />Also knocking down the entertainment factor is Micah, one of the worst jackwagons in cinematic history. I wished for his death every moment he was on-screen.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|This game is fantastic. I like the new magic idea. It adds a little fasas. Though it is an excellent game, the connection is garbage. I've been trying to log on the game for 3 days and it still won't work. Please fix this. If you do, I'll rate this game 5 stars. If you don't, everyone will criticise your game and the average rating will lower.

B005PK57IK|4.0|Great storyline and well written characters. A friend recommended the show. I started at the beginning and I was hooked.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|The Incredible Hulk is one of the good comic book adaptations that juggles realism with fantasy without sacrificing a good ole superhero brawl or two. After it was over, I wanted more, which is the benchmark of any worthwhile movie.<br /><br />What the first Hulk movie has over this one is its cast. I prefer the previous cast to this one with the exception of Edward Norton. He’s a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana could have ever been. But then again no one in Hulk was given anything decent to work with.<br /><br />All in all, The Incredible Hulk isn’t incredible, but it’s definitely watchable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you want a simple, basic calculator to get you by on your normal mathematical needs, this will work just fine.

B000FC2PKG|4.0|Just what I need, another series to get hooked on reading! You might think you have this one solved before DD, but then you don't.
B001GCUO16|3.0|Like with all other movies in the X-Men series, this one is action-packed. Fans will find lots to like while non/casual fans will be entertained.<br /><br />The world didn’t need this movie as Wolverine’s origin is satisfactorily given center stage in X2. While this is an entertaining diversion, there’s nothing essential about this movie.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to pack as many references to the comic book series that it becomes distracting to those in the know. To those not, these references are wasted and only provide narrative clutter.<br /><br />The de-aging CGI employed at the end is an awful blemish to a otherwise decent movie.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I like how it simply really hard to do. Easy things annoy me so I like the challenge I suppose.
B00006F7IM|4.0|whether you are in to baseball or not this is a one great comedy, what more is their to say.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Was good, but Stark seemed to act like he was on drugs or something. As always good action, but for me the other two were better.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Not happy with this app at all..  Worked fine on my Kindle Fire HD for a few months but now I no longer have the ability to search for friends.  Tells me I need to update to newer version every time I go to FB but there is no newer version..  I have uninstalled and installed several times but nothing works.. Tried notifying FB but nothing there either. Just frustrated with this app right now.
B001GAPC1K|3.0|A smart, rich guy becomes a superhero in this adaptation of the classic comic book character.<br /><br />This movie was made to entertain and it does without caring about art or any other non-commercial elements. The acting, plot, and story is top-notch -- everyone carries their own weight, which results in a stellar effort.<br /><br />This movie is Hollywood fast food. It entertains for two hours and that’s it. Hit ‘n’ git entertainment defined. There’s nothing really horrible with this movie. It is what it is and that’s better than most of the crap that’s out there.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game. I also have dumb ways to live. It's fun and challenging and I like how the app also gives the music video.
B001UN1KVE|4.0|Hilarious movie, corny situations,.This movie was rated before PG 13 today it most likely would be rated PG 13. check it out
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A great product for $35. Works as advertised. It is also very easy to set up and use. Would recommend to anybody looking for a streaming player compatible with almost any device.
B00E0SX118|5.0|Very cute movie. I bought it for my girls not thinking I would like the movie but since I've bought it, I've watched it 4 time. (I bought this movie 5 days ago)
B0042MDAL8|4.0|Vampires. Werewolves. Oh my!<br /><br />Gone are the pretensions that ruined its predecessor New Moon. Here is great entertainment for males and females alike. There’s action, intrigue, and romance -- all in equal doses.<br /><br />Though it’s part of an established series, the whole saga is getting old. This movie should have been the second with the best parts of New Moon (which are few) edited into it. Unfortunately, we’re stuck with the same old same old that’s become formulaic by this point.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Its great app but i don't like that there is not abc. But i love this app. Everyone must have this
B004X2M3N8|5.0|The direction the story line takes was completely shocking to me.  I'm not usually that surprised by plot twists, but this caught me completely off guard.  I always have trouble loving the new Doctor at first because he old one has become dear to me.  Now that I've adjusted I do love Matt Smith.  Amy and Rory are so great.  And River, too.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|I cannot believe how slow this thing is. In over one hour, it has uploaded (to the cloud) only 37 photos. I have 909 pics on the iPhone. This is going to take forever, even in &#34;large upload mode.&#34; I'd strongly advise finding something else. Better yet, use USB connection through your PC to upload your photos to the cloud. Well, excuse me, but I have to go stop this ridiculous thing and grab a USB cable.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I'd just purchase the chromecast and one I installed the software on my computer I was ready to cast into my TV. Everything was fine  but then after 20 seconds of casting it stopped all of a sudden.<br /><br />I reviewed the chromecast page and they say that they are aware of this issue and they still are working on it. They shouldn't sell it until they fix this problem.<br /><br />I have everything updated in my laptop and in my TV... so they are the problem.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a pretty decent hidden object game. It doesn't time out when you get to a certain point you do,; however, you have to either be patient or short cut it with money
B009RH9FR6|4.0|There weren't good instructions on how to use it to stand up so I don't have to hold it.  I know there is a way just not sure how to do it.
B00FF03K0M|5.0|This Elton John CD is the best.  There is more attention to his excellent piano playing abilities. Love this. I have had a only a few days & listen to it constantly.  It is my favorite of all my many Elton John CD's! His voice has even improved with maturity.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|What an amazing story of life in North Korea!  How citizens survive and never know what life truly is about.
B009JZWO3I|2.0|I am not a late night person, but I would do whatever it takes to stay up for this show.  The combination of perfectly picked actors/actresses for each part and the interesting story lines makes it a 10 out of 10 for me and my husband.  Along with NCIS, NCIS LA, Las Vegas and Good Wife, we will have every episode in our home library.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Very informative although I could have skipped some of the technical depth of some of the testing,etc...but learned a lot...
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|This is not what I expected.  I did happen to down load this by accident.  Be more careful next time.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|As expected, size was as promised . Arrived quickly with no damage but thought could use to print off Kindle and never could figure iron out
B00F35BV64|5.0|I'm just a casual fan of this franchise, but have to say that this film along with the previous one are outstanding.  I was completely engaged in the story from start to finish. There was never a dull moment and all the characters seemed to fit their parts perfectly. It's nice to watch a film like this. It doesn't disappoint.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I think that a boy should have sex with me  sex in the city is a good idea that a dog could not find out how to have sex.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I found this book to be one I couldn't put down. So nice to have a straight forward read with so little violence and no explicit sex which I think so many people are sick of. A really enjoyable reading experience and I look forward to the third book in the series.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The book told the story of an orphan (now in her late 80's) that was sent to the Midwest on a train in the 1920's and blended it to a girl in foster care at the present time.  The bonding of the two main characters made for a very heart felt story.  Prior to reading this book I was unaware of the orphan trains taking street children from New York to the upper Midwest. The book is the best I have read in months.
B00AYB1KHW|5.0|great character building and pacing, even for how old it is, still has great quality. Glad I could watch it again because I do not own it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan since 1970 when I was a little kid. I've seen every episode except Voyager)  and every movie. So when the new Star Trek movie came out in 2009 - I totally hated it because I felt it wanted to invalidate 45 years of film making. I still hate the first movie from that perspective but I can sit through it now. This new movie is infinitely easier to watch, the action is engrossing, the story line is very god and the performances of the actors and actresses is excellent. The heat between Uhura and Spock is one of the high points of the movie. And the actress that plays Carol Markus is a perfect match for Jim Kirk (again), Great Movie - Blu-Ray worthy.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think it is a brilliant game I got it to day and can't stop going on it. Would highly recommend it.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I'm going to recommend Grain Brain to everyone I know. There would be a lot less physical and mental disease in our country if Dr. Perlmutter's dietary recommendations were the norm.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This is a great game but they need to have better hair styles and unlock everything well at least most.
B009EDZGY4|5.0|How can you not fall in love with these creatures. The make you laugh and cry and are just lovable all the way around..
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Ok maybe its because I've seen thousands of movies and I've been able to figure out what the writers will do (most of the time) - So the story wasn't overly gripping. Aside from the usual lack of common sense and story holes, I think Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman both made this movie better than it would have been if lesser stage presences were used. The special effects were very good and the story itself was Ok. If I've seen a movie in a theater - I will buy the Blu-ray if I loved it (i.e. Star Trek Into Darkness) , I'd probably  watch it on PPV if I really liked it (World War Z) , or not watch it again (i.e. Thousands of movies - Most recently Elysium). In this case - Maybe PPV if nothing else was on.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This cd is great. It has a wide genre of pop & r&b. Its really a must have for fans of Ariana Grande
1878424319|3.0|The author writes about magic and idols and says that we are God.  As a Christian, I am strongly aware of satan's use of these items and thoughts in our lives.  However the basics of the agreements are Biblical and can help folks struggling with self-esteem issues, social-interactions, those who are being hurt by others, etc.  However, I would only recommend this for strong Christians who could weed through the non-Biblical items.  Otherwise, I would fear it would lead someone in the wrong direction.
B006LSZECO|5.0|fast paced. I liked how it was told from the perspective of man and woman.....scary calculating woman...the ending makes me want to know more
B00F2LKJ4Y|5.0|We all love this movie. The music, the romance. The friendships. All make for a great movie that is an instant classic .
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|One of the best movies of 2012. Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Dinero are all in top notch form. Must see movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is phenomenal! It keeps me occupied when I'm bored.  This game takes a lot of concentration, too! :) It's sooo fun!
007174889X|5.0|This is the most important textbook of medicine, since the time of my graduation (1973) till today, with all the necessary changes done, in order to make it suitable to the 21st century. A must in any physician's and medical student's library.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is easy to install and use. Highly recommended for the relatively low cost. Hoping they develop more applications to usewith it.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|This is a love it or hate it movie. I and my family love it. Quirky and a great movie for Halloween time.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I don't know exactly when and how  I discovered Brandon Sanderson. Whether it was via The Wheel of Time series or in one of his early books. One thing I'm sure of though I've always like his voice as a writer. When the hero hurts, they hurt. And though at times the hero might have superpowers, their humanity shines through.<br /><br />For Steelheart. David, the main character is as human and as fragile as a normal human. He has to fight super humans called Epics to survive. And to do that, he has to use wit and cunning.<br /><br />The story is a variation of the David and Goliath story. What makes it very interesting and fun to read is how an orphan like David survived and adapted in the steel jungle called Newcago.<br /><br />You will cheer David, even call him an idiot at times. But David is lovable because of his humanity and his ability to love even in a post apocalyptic world.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This was an interesting read.  I highly recommend it.  It has a good plot, and the author did a very nice job.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator ever. I use it every day. It's good for paying bills and the best part about it is it keeps track of what you typed.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think this is a great game! It's exactly like this title states, minecraft to keep in your pocket! But there's a few bad things.. Okay so, realms, basically a multi player part, but I gets major buggy with it, the other people playing will see you frozen. And they can still injure you even if you not there! Also, I really think they should add more (Caves, animal breeding etc.) And not have the map so little. Over all, try it out! I don't think it was a waste of money. Hope this helps!
B0026SFEW8|5.0|If you love the 50's era you will love this movie. The cloths, the romance, the music all make for a great any age group  movie.
B00D3ZJDRA|5.0|I find it amazing when artists from completely different backgrounds find one another and make great music. That is what has happened here. Valerie June, (who is new to me) and Dan Auerbach, have hit one out of the park with this release. It just gets better with every listen. (Don't listen once and file it away).<br /><br />Sonically, I personally have an issue with jumbling all of these artists up in the center image. I can only assume that's the effect the makers were looking for. It could have been so much better with everone as a part of a wider soundstage. 4 for sonics, 5 for music.
0060763280|5.0|This is quite a book. The title says it all and Harv explains things in real simple and understandable terms so you can follow through and start changing your money blueprint for the better. Buy it, read it and see for yourself if you really desire to create a better financial future for yourself and your loved ones.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have read most of Nelson DeMille's books and enjoyed all of them.  This  one, however, did not hold my interest. I gave up midway when the book began to feel like a homework assignment.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Loved the fact that this book was in a guy's perspective! It was  real refreshing! Not to mention hilarious as hell!! Hopefully there's another book in this series!
B00BW6SOIQ|5.0|A love story of sorts. I really like the use of subtle sarcasm. Check your assumptions at the door. You might learn something, or not. Either way I think if you're open minded you'll really appreciate this film.<br /><br />Pay attention to the use of color. It's not as apparent as how Tim Burton does things, but it's there and adds a lot to the story.
0440246318|1.0|I'm an avid fan who has read all his previous Reacher books.  This book does not have the same style or feel.  It's very slow with a lot of fluff and the secondary characters are his worst ever.  Don't believe the reviews on the cover....skip this one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I play everyday to my daugther to show her favorite  TV program.<br />It's easy to use and convenient. So I like it.

B009PMEEY2|4.0|Pretty fun, not much replay value in my opinion. That's really the only flaw I could find. Worth your time, especially if you pick it up free or on sale.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a<br />is agreat app. The numbers are large so that you can see them clearly. I love it because you do not have to have wifi to pull it up. And it great when your in a hurry.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|This movie is so so sad and makes you realize how important life is. Two terrific actors come together for a perfect performance duo.<br />DeNiro can do anything and Williams is excellent.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|Simply put, this is a silly movie in an enjoyable kind of way, that is fun, often funny, sometimes crude, but with an amazing opening and some of the best lines throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />The opening, actually the first twenty minutes of the movie is top notch comedy. You get everything need to know, and wrapped in an ultra-funny way. You get an on-set filming of a Vietnam war movie, actor clashes, big egos and pettiness, mistimed special effects explosions, director losing control and desperate to regain it, and a movie mogul with a power trip.<br /><br />Desperate circumstances (movie is way behind in production and actors aren't doing their job) call for desperate measures. The nice little movie set is cashed in for a dirty, gritty guerrilla-style film project, that of course is not well planned. And all of this is amazingly funny and happens in the first twenty minutes. Great lines, funny delivery.<br /><br />The rest of the movie, though the plot is basic, is carried by some great comedy one liners, mostly delivered by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. Both of these two carry the movie after the first twenty minutes to the end of the film.<br />Here are just a few examples:<br /><br />Tom Cruise: \\"You kick down the door to my house, wanting a TiVo scrap for your client, who was 3rd Runner-up for Sexiest Man Alive 1998, and ask if I'm serious.\\"<br /><br />Tom Cruise: Your client is a white dwarf headed down a black hole. Let's face it, the kids aren't dressing up like him for Purim anymore.\\"<br /><br />There are plenty of others.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, and like Stiller's brand of comedy, check it out.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B008V4H6N6|5.0|I remember finding FL's Los Angeles album and liking that a lot, Cosmogramma I had mixed feelings on albeit he's never done a track with Laura Darlington that I wondered about - Table Tennis was a shining example of solid work.<br /><br />This album seemed like it was an even further distillation of an emotional idea. The problem with rating electronic music that people fall into all too often is that its easily, perhaps like rock, to worry about the athleticism of the gutarists, how many chords he can bust out in a minute, how fast and accurately a drummer can drum, whether the band puts on a great stage show of the singer doing backflips, swallowing swords, breathing fire, etc. and with electronic music it seems like people complain rather quickly if something's not happening in the music that's a brand new production trick or something that really wows on technical merit or complexity.<br /><br />I actually liked it a lot, it seemed incredibly lucid in terms of emotionally knowing what he wanted to get out of his mixes. The way I tend to rate electronic music is how well a picture conveys a thousand words or how well a tune conveys a thousand pictures. Stuff that drills deep, goes archetypal, that's the kind of thing that gets me going - ie. its real, its gritty, there's something in it where they reached quite a ways deeper into their own minds than most people are used to.<br /><br />I'd still argue that this is another step forward along FL's path of expression. It's very much an aural DXM trip, even more intensely psychedelic than his past work while staying thoughtful and observant as always. Will be great to see what he comes up with next. For me though, as someone who grew up in the rave scene from 1997 forward and particularly in dark drum & bass - the communication of the music and what's communicated as well as how well an album makes something like a stellar dj set means more to me than whether or not FL did something that absolutely knocked the socksoff the world as having never been done before; in 2013 that's getting pretty damn hard for anyone to come up with.<br /><br />That said I'm happy enough to find an artist who can emotionally and spiritually keep me interested. I'll stick with circus soleil for juggling and fire-breathing entertainment.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I love this movie. Its a long movie, but the time goes so fast as it is so interesting. Leonardo DiCaprio should win a AA one day as he is a wonderful actor. This is a wonderful part for him and you believe he is Howard.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Not sure what the issue may be as all of a sudden we can not connect.... son loves it however every time he seems to be ahead of the game somethings goes wrong that we have to delete app and start all over.. this stinks please fix the glitch.
B004P8JPS6|2.0|Not very realistic or believable.  His books are all the same!  The military is not like he portrays it. Not going to read any more of the Reacher books!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I love regular flow and I love this game too, I was just hoping for some little twist on the original but didn't get it - hence only 4 stars.

B008JFUNKU|5.0|Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Director Paul Greengrass rarely disappoints, whether it's with his two \\"Bourne\\" movies or with the OMG \\"United 93.\\"  Because the film is based on real events, the film has feel of dramatic accuracy, similar to \\"United 93.\\"  And like that film, this one has a mix of veteran actors and an effective group of newbies.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is the veteran actor who really counts.  He has another memorable performance as Phillips, the captain of a U. S. flagged freighter.  He and his crew are caught off the Somali coast and, after some heroic efforts, are ultimately boarded by a handful of armed pirates.  Most filmmakers would likely have eschewed any back story of how those pirates got to a profession of taking cargo and crew as hostages, but Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray take the time to see how fishermen become criminals.  It doesn't make what they do any more acceptable, but does give us an understanding.<br /><br />Greengrass keeps the audience wrapped up tight as the pirates search the ship for the hiding crew.  Only Phillips and 2 crewmen from the bridge are being held.  Phillips is calm and does his best to keep his crew safe.  Tension mounts as the Somalis led by Muse (remarkable Barkhad Abdi) take Phillips and $30K (from the safe) into the ocean inside a capsule-like lifeboat.  The U. S. Navy intercepts the lifeboat, refusing to allow it to enter the Somalian mainland.<br /><br />The standoff ratchets up again, especially after the S.E.A.L. team is called in.  With the crew snacking on what I assume are coco leaves, they become more and more agitated.  Especially Najee (Faysal Ahmed) who would scare the hell out of anyone in his high-as-a-kite condition, waving around a .45 semi-automatic pistol.  Greengrass doesn't give the audience a lot of time to celebrate Phillips ultimate extraction either.  This is where Hanks will likely draw some Oscar votes.  In a state of shock that seems authentic to me, Phillips has to be coaxed to breathe by the ship's corpsman.  Hell, I felt like she was bringing me out of the same state.  This is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.  One of the year's best.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (6-3-14):<br /><br />This second viewing of this remarkable film, allowed me to look a bit closer at some of the technical aspects of the film.  I was immediately struck by the editing (Christopher Rouse).  Let's face it, the middle part of an action based drama can be a bit of a challenge to keep interesting.  Much of that middle slog is overcome by some quick edits and views of several things going on at the same time.  I was also impressed with the authentic look of the \\"Alabama\\" with its bits of rust and crud.  Also another look at the acting suggest the various award nominations for Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi are clearly warranted.  Hanks final scene remains fixed in my memory.  Finally, this is another near perfect movie by Paul Greengrass, who excels in these action thrillers.<br /><br />The Blu ray package provides a 1080p video resolution with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  It looks perfect.  Somewhat surprisingly, the colors are excellent given the mostly shipboard based film.  But the ocean looks very lifelike.  The actors are bruised up, always sweating and look very tired.  The skin textures and detail leave no doubt as to the character's condition.  If anything the audio track is even better.  Using a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack, the disc handles both the small ambient sounds early in the film and the crescendo of concluding fireworks.  I had just tweaked my subwoofers and they came to attention as the action got going.  The dialog is easily understood including the halting English spoken by the pirates.  Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include an audio commentary by Greengrass and a 3-part documentary (about 1 hour total), a DVD and UV Digital copy and some previews.illips has to be coaxed to breathe by the ship's corpsman.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|3-3.5 Stars<br /><br />So, right off the bat, I want to explain my rating is not based on the wait for this book, or the fact that last minute it was sprung that #3 is not the final book, and that there will be 2 more books before the story ends.<br /><br />I do want to address what happened, however. I think that authors need to really think about taking offers from big publishers before they sign. I sincerely doubt Sylvia Day intended any of what happened with this series to happen. I think things were out of her hands for the most part. At least that's what I'd like to think. Let's face it, big publishers are a corporation, all they care about is the bottom line, not the readers. I bet they saw how well the first two books did, decided they needed more books, then a TV deal was thrown in and that's how 3 became 5. I don't know how big publishers work, but I think authors need to be a lot more careful in negotiating a contract.<br /><br />On to what I think of the book, what I rated it on. I think the book was filler. I think it dragged. I think at this point in a series, there shouldn't be so many new plots thrown in. It seemed to me, that the author was going one way, and then added stuff in to be able to justify more books. I don't think it was nice the way it ended.<br /><br />I hate Eva. To think that what calmed her irrational insecurities and jealousy was Gideon doing what he did (in Reflected). That's sick.<br /><br />I used to love Gideon, but now I think he's a fool.<br />If Eva's change of heart wasn't due to that, I would have enjoyed the book much more, but it pissed me off.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I'm not buying the next 2 books. If I see them in the library, I'll take them out, but I'm not spending another $20
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I would have never read this book without all the controversy. It certainly did not shake my faith.  I feel far more informed about how the Christian faith evolved. Well written and fascinating.
B00AFQC4QC|3.0|The book was good and kept me interested, however, I did not enjoy the style of writing.  It was awkward and you never were able to get inside the characters' heads.  Instead of a fiction story, it felt like a documentary. It was one of those books that you couldn't wait to be done with instead of one of those books that you hate to see end.  I don't think I will be reading the other 2 books in the trilogy.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Gladwell starts unpromisingly with the clich&eacute;d story of David and Goliath but salvages the narrative with real life stories of those disadvantaged heroes who like David fight to their own advantages rather than on their adversaries' chosen ground. Coaches of girls basketball and curers of childhood leukemia rejected standard practices and conventional wisdom to snatch victories against all odds. Other stories such as that of \\"three strikes out\\" are harder to fit into Gladwell's thesis. Most compelling is the exposition of desirable difficulty, which in itself makes the book well worth reading. An easy read on Kindle: I downloaded and finished it in three short sessions during a busy weekend.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|great movie loved it watch it a lot so you can buy it and like it too go get it
B00EU9VCKO|2.0|Takes a perfectly good picture and makes it look like a washed out old bad picture, not sure I see the charm. I am old enough to remember the old film days with cheap cameras,you would pay your money for processing and hope the results were better than what you see here.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wow....I just finished reading this  wonderful book and I am struck by the beauty and importance of family and the relationships that bind us together.  How easy it is to feel that the familial bonds are full of limits and boundaries and yet it is those relationships that shape us.  I would advise the reader to keep a mental log of the characters because there are a lot of them.  These different characters and plot lines tie the central story together yet you the reader will experience not only varying emotions but truth be told a bit of confusion at times.  As an example, I was a bit lost during the story of the Commander Sahib and his son Adel. It did not add much to the story.  But, I guess even a war criminal can have love for his family....  It did however, answer the question of Abdullah's stepbrother.<br /><br />Hosseini tapped into the female perspective with such eloquence and accuracy.  His ability to describe a scene and/or location transported me many times to these places around the globe.  I was truly able to feel the emotions experienced by each of the characters.  It was a beautifully written novel.  I can't say that I had a favorite character but my favorite story was the story of Nabi and Suleiman.  The love that existed between them was beautiful.  It began out of duty and ended in quiet comfort.  I was brought to tears as I closed this wonderful book.<br /><br />I leave you with one of my favorite passages....\\"People think they live by what they want.  But really what guides them is what they're afraid of.  What they don't want.\\" (pg. 340)
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Let me clarify, I'm giving this 4 stars because there isn't a 3.5. I went into &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34; with low expectations based on many of the reviews I had read. It's true, too much of the book centers around my least favorite character. This said - I - a few chapters aside, had an enjoyable experience. I am yet to read the fifth book - at which point it will be more clear to me if my takeaways from this one have some real payoff.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's still one of the better written books you'll read, even if it's weakest in the series to date experience wise for me. As someone else said, being the weakest in a series of awesome books - doesn't always make you bad.
1616960922|4.0|A fun, quick read. Not as big as many of Sanderson's other works, but no less entertaining with rich characters doing the best with their circumstances. The ending is incredibly memorable and uplifting with it's underlying message.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this game is perfect for me! I love this game you can jump the horse and feed them, and care for your horse.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is a must buy...it is an easy way to connect to existing networks to listen to Pandora, Google TV, Music, Movies, Netflix. It works from smart phones, tablets (mac/pc/android). Watch YouTube to know exact limitations of smartphones: you cannot cast from Google chrome browser on phone.  You get full hd to your tv using apps rather than browser.<br />I cannot wait for more browsing capability like photos with slide show ability.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|My first run through this album was OK but every listen since makes my realize how talented Kanye West is.  This album is a must for any hip hop or R&B fan.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|It's Star Trek what else do you need to say. These remasterd  versions are really beautifully done. This will show your  HD system just what it is capable of.  The 5.1 soundtrack is really good. The quality of the transfers are much better than anything you have ever seen broadcast before. Buy it and be prepaired for a viewing experience. Just watch out for when Capt. Pickard looks down and the glare from his balding head. Have sunglasses ready.  Just joking. If you love Star Trek TNG, these transfers will take you where you have never been before with the whole crew.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|By far the best book I've read. I felt like I was with them the entire time. Will read more from this amazing writer and hero.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV and likely, the best legal show - bar none. Watch it!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Good time killer. Some of the things are really funny. The problems with this game is it gets boring fast. It was fun while it lasted,but I have deleted the game.
B00DYVESVO|5.0|Shows the true power of the hulk. Though the supers got off light. Otherwise it was absolutely and totaly freaking amazing
B00F3HQMV6|4.0|Some songs got moved onto this album from the &#34;Play Harder&#34; remix EP and the &#34;Play Hard&#34; EP.  Features the hit &#34;Live for the Night&#34; as Track 1, and it starts out a good pace for the rest of the album.  This is definitely more of a club dubstep sound, and I would go as far as to say it has a more commercial vibe, because it sounds like so many other artists that populate the dubstep EDM genre right now.  There is something to be said about having a commercial sound to your music, and to me that means it's the most common style.<br />That being said, the &#34;Get Wet&#34; album is full of catchy songs, including the ones that are recycled back in from the previous EP's. Very happy adding them to my current daily playlist for work.
B008Y5N3O8|3.0|The movie is watchable, but it won't have you on the edge of your seat at any point.  It's about a bunch of unlikeable, self-pitying real estate salesmen, all desperate to make a sale over the span of an evening and the next morning.  They all treat everyone else except their colleagues as marks for their con, so none of the characters are anyone that most viewers would want to identify with (maybe if you're in sales and your boss is a tyrannical jerk, you'll sympathize whether you want to or not).  The closest things to interesting conflict in this movie are a contest that the boss (well played by Alec Baldwin) creates, whereby the best salesman wins a Cadillac, and the worst gets fired.  In desperation, one of the salesmen (well played by Ed Harris) plans to rob their office and steal their best sales leads.  The theft itself is mostly just a plot device by the story's writer, to raise stress for all the characters, by bringing in a police investigation.  Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, and Kevin Spacey all give fine performances, but there just is not a lot to work with, story-wise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome...I love the graphics ,the level of difficulty....and the tokens and prizes.The only thing I don't understand are the rewards ,like the cassette tape and the others,I am totaly addicted and I never played games before....keep up the great work...better than minion rush and temple run 1 and 2.

B00EKWTLUO|5.0|Great soundtrack.  Djawadi has done an amazing work for the movie. Have a few other of his OST in the library
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|A Story that lost it's way and was headed nowhere anyway. Save yourself from this and go and watch paint dry.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Pleasingly simply. Simply pleasing! Addicting. I don't enjoy the ridiculous slots ad popup every single time I log on. However this game is just fun mindless and a great time killer..
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast does what it’s supposed to. As far as streaming Netflix goes it's great. However, when you mirror your screen there are some overcast issues and the audio still plays through your computer speakers. I know the overcast is a TV issue, but it would be nice if there was something in the options menu to fix it. Keep in mind the screen mirroring and tab casting are experimental and beta respectively. Tab casting works well, but there is some noticeable lag when scrolling. Google has announced that there are more updates to come especially when Chrome 30 comes out. The Chromecast can only get better and has the potential to be rated five stars when the software updates come out. I would definitely buy one again.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I didn't think it would be as good as it is. Good story line, All the Star trek characters are impressive.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|because there are restrictions of playback (playable depending if the audio is aac vs ac-3) I cannot play most of my MKVs. Hopefully this gets fixed later on.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Watching the movie Thor was okay. Some of the scenes were very dark and I could not follow the action. Aside from the dark scenes, the movie was worth watching.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have read all three book in the series.  I was completely into the story and read all three books in a 4 day weekend.
B004PGO25O|4.0|The term shipping and minimal viable product gets bandied around a lot when speaking about an entrepreneurial venture.<br /><br />When reading the book I am reminded that you don't have to have a product to ship, everyday struggles of worthiness and taking a position on something still puts you in the &#34;exposed &#34; position.<br /><br />Good read I enjoyed the content.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it but now waiting for an update, which I hope comes very soon!  Had some difficulty but was fun trying to figure out what I left out.
B001I10ABE|5.0|always a winner. Metallica is just the greatest of the heavy metal bands from the past and it was great to get it on record
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's a bit on the cliche side, but the language in it and the whole tone of the book is refreshing enough to make up for it. I cried for about 7 years. I'm just now getting over it. I recommend this book to all the hormonal teenage girls out there who need a good cry. Read this book.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Kept me waiting more the whole time. Filled my dreams with alternate stories of Cleary and Jace. Very good read excited for the next.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|The acting often rips my heart out.  Writing is suspenseful and full of surprises.  Of course, there is violence.  Awaiting Season 3.
B0085GUXZI|5.0|great music. Got it on record so it sounds just like in the old days. A lot of nostalgia and fun.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|after playing first person shooters its cool to be able to take a break from the real console games and just try for a high score instead of well......shooting mech's aliens spy's soldiers.of course im talking about shooting in games not real life.lol
B008JFUOVI|3.0|This was much better than part II, but still not that funny, even though I laughed at this more than I did part II.  I know one thing about the creators of this series - they have some very big issues with Asian, and the Chinese in particular.  Like part II, there is non-stop racism against Asians to rival the movie &#34;Safe.&#34;<br /><br />Aside from Asian racism (which they won't complain about I am sure), this film is of course on par with most of Hollywood with the Illuminati agendas and the many references to them.  Of course there is the usual pro-homoerotic theme throughout the film in EVERY way (sick).  Too bad Hollywood (secret society) can't just make films without trying to brainwash.  Then there were the references to Illuminati events that they cause like the DEMEROL (their Michael Jackson hit) and the Vegas streets when Tupac (hit) was killed.<br /><br />There is too much satanic activity in entertainment that I am kind of getting tired of watching their garbage.  The ending set it up for a possible sequel, but at the same time a close out if needed.  Given that this one flopped as people refused to get suckered after the last one, there should not be another, but this is Hollywood and they are known for endless sequels even if they do not turn a profit!  It's not about the profit for them, it is about the brainwashing, that is why MOST films involve endless killing, sex, drugs and racism!

0060229357|5.0|This is nice book. My toddler loves to hear it a lot. Best thing about this book is, this has a nice flow of imagination. It talks about the basic concepts like walking, climbing, sinking etc. and social concepts of not wasting food. And it also describes the journey of a toddler for his room and finally sleeps.<br /><br />Very nice book, I will recommend this for parents who wants to walk with the child once again in the moonlight!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Keeps grandchild busy  while I have calls to make.  Plus its a game we can play together and she usually wins
B005LJK3AC|2.0|It sort of seemed funny in the beginning, but then it just turned really trite, and we ended up valuing our time enough to not finish watching it, so we stopped halfway through. The characters turned pretty unlikable once they started actually killing their bosses, and the characters were just these static cardboard cutouts that were annoying, bumbling through the movie and just being irritating. We rented Star Trek Into Darkness instead. That was also boring, but for different reasons.
B00B52F278|5.0|another installment on an already great show. I have so far bought every season. Great cast and story line--about an actual historical happening.
1577314808|5.0|Read this book with an open mind and you'll be in love! There are times when Tolle says things are facts that are clearly opinions, but if you can get past some minor fallacies, the overarching themes of the book are really enlightening.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I don't know how Mr. Sanderson does it but he can make relatable characters and amazing backdrops for his stories.  He is definitely one of my favorite authors and did not disappoint with this easy to read, nail biting story that keeps you guessing.  I even thought I had a few things figured out and was beginning to get disappointed but shouldn't have doubted.  Great book!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I use the Chromecast to stream YouTube and NetFlix video from my iPhone to my TV.  The set-up didn't work the first time I installed it.  It sat for a day and I tried again and it worked seamlessly.<br /><br />I wish it had some more apps that it worked with but you can't beat the price.
1623650003|3.0|I had such mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand the first one hundred and fifty pages or so was tear through the pages relentless. A young beautiful girl is brutally kidnapped before being stuffed naked into a small box that makes her the human equivalent of veal, and then left to die with a mass of hungry rats looking for a way into her hell chamber. Her abductor says nothing to her except he's brought her here to watch her die. Alternating with that is the investigator who is in a mad dash to find the girl. But that's only the beginning of the story, and one that is so ultimately sadistic and down right cruel, the loose comparisons to 'The Dragon Tattoo' trilogy stop there. Lisbeth Salander was brutalized, but part of the catharsis of those books was how she extracted her revenge. This woman Alex seems merciless and violent, but as her story becomes revealed,(no spoiler here) I just felt dirty and sad for her. Supposedly's apart of a trilogy, Lemaitre is an interesting writer, I just which I didn't feel so much like I needed a shower and a drink after.

I see everyone's having this problem. Please get it fixed asap !

B00A285OOW|4.0|This is the story of Elizabeth of York, who became Queen of England when she married Henry VII, thus joining the houses of York and Tudor at the end of the War of the Roses. I don't know where Ms. Gregory gets her details, but I was stunned (and fascinated) by several juicy pieces of information. First, Elizabeth of York (daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville) was the mistress of the infamous Richard III - who was her uncle! This is the same guy who was vilified by Shakespeare and historians for killing his nephews, the Princes in the Tower. (Which Gregory does not accept, and neither do I.) Elizabeth was sister to those two princess, and according to Gregory, one of only a handful of people who knew that her mother had secreted the youngest boy away to live in hiding. That hidden prince plays a huge part in this story. Was it true? I don't know, but there are historians who think so, and Gregory successfully makes a case.<br /><br />I did know that Henry VII was a cruel and paranoid king, but how Gregory could know that he systematically raped Elizabeth before they were married in order to ensure she was fertile, I have no idea. Was that true? I don't know, but I'm so very curious I want to do some research myself.<br /><br />Which is the hallmark of a good historical novel -- it makes you itch to find out how much is real and how much is the product of the author's imagination. And what a rich imagination Gregory has!

B004WR125O|3.0|I took care of the mac address filtering problem. I had to broadcast my network id, SSID and disable mac address network filtering. Select manual setup and find the network id and configured the password. Once it is done, the mac address of UWF-1 will be captured by my router. Or you can find that in setup, network it has been captured by the receiver.  Please note, if you remove uwf-1, the receiver has it's own mac address. I then enable mac address filtering on my router and input the mac address of the UWF-1 that I found earlier.<br /><br />I then encounter buffering problem when I put UWF-1 at the rear and I had to take the UWF-1 to the front. 2 possibilities : I had a WII and my router is about 15 feet away.  Some thread was saying that it may be affected by WII or playstation.<br /><br />My receiver is TX-NR818.<br /><br />Now - I am good with no buffering problem and have been happy listening to Pondora.<br /><br />Thanks

B008Y212PI|4.0|I enjoy this type of puzzle, and this is a good example of the genre.  It is basically a logic puzzle, but unlike some of its type, it will help you figure out where you went wrong, and doesn't try to extort additional money for the clue.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is a very good game, it makes u think a lot and I think it helps u learn how to sol e stuff easyer
B001QWBM62|4.0|It works great! I use it record reharseals and jams. Its great to plug in your guitar/bass/electric drum set and record on separeted tracks. I would loke to have some other functions, like some voice effects (echos and stuff).<br />Zoom H4n has 3 modes: Multi Track Record (MTR), Stereo (two tracks - the inbuilt mics or line inputs, not simultaneously) and 4 channel. Not all functions are available on every mode. For example, guitar effects and metronome are only available one MTR.<br />Also it has a tool for cropping tracks... this is almost useless. For musicians: its cool that you can save songs (or drum tracks, etc) on your sd card with a computer, and then play those songs on the H4n and play on top of that... the bad news is that you wont be able to record that.<br />Overall, great quality. It met my expectatios. Great recording quality. I've accomplished great quality audio with the MTR. Still, if you want PRO quality recording, you´ll need a computer on the side, hace that in mind.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it's a wonderful game. Ive played it for years and I still love it. I think that whoever made this game did a great job.
1449410243|5.0|I've never really checked out The Oatmeal, and maybe that impacted how I felt about this book. I'd seen some of the stuff in the book, because it had been shared by various people. Anyway, the book is funny. It is a bit repetitive, but that's kind of par for the course with some comedy/humor books.<br /><br />Even though I really enjoyed this book, I'm not sure if I would be willing to buy it. It's not exactly something that would be entertaining after you've already read it. I would suggest people check it out from their local libraries, unless they are collectors of stuff by The Oatmeal.
B005PK553C|4.0|Very well written show and great actors! I got a little confused on season 2 the actors from the first season are playing different roles. I still was excited for season 2
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Very challenging, and I look forward to the next level, very fun and fast paced.  Pretty easy to figure it out.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This will only stream limited media services.  It does not stream what is on your tablet, without add-on apps.  They couldn't be used on my device and the Netflix app doesn't work either.
1451673442|5.0|I have just started the book.  I had already read the Secret.  It has be back on the road to my own happiness!  It starts simply and gets to the point quickly.  Another masterpiece by Rhonda Byrne.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read a lot and am pretty patient with typo errors but I did not realize how much I missed a book that was put together not only well but with very few grammatical errors. It makes the reading experience so much more enjoyable and allows the reader to get lost in the story.<br /><br />The story line was very original with lots of twists and turns that made the whole experience worthwhile. I found I could not put the book down. I really enjoyed the main characters corny attempts at metaphors. It must have taken Sanderson hours to think of them.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone. My only complaint is having to wait so long for the next installment to come out. I am not a patient person.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|I couldn't put it down. A through review of the history of nuclear weapons in the US and the world intertwined with an &#34;accident&#34; at a missile silo.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I like the device very much and have shared my purchase with other friends. Why wasn't this product advertised in Ipads magazines.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Difficult to put down this book. It is surprising, emotional, full of tension, while being quite poetic at the same time. I thoroughly recommend it.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|Elton John's new set is a strong one.  \\"The Ballad of Blind Tom\\" stands out for me with its rocking homage to black musical pioneers whose music was flawless but who nevertheless suffered from discrimination, \\"Just throw Blind Tom a bone, from the times of King Cotton may we present to you, all you Jim Crow monkeys from Harlan County down to Tuscaloo.\\"  \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" also bounces in classic mode with John's vocals strong against the gospel-flavored backing vocals, \\"Get back to the wellspring, purify the stream.\\"  \\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\" & \\"A Town Called Jubilee\\" are also strong tracks.  Enjoy!
B0029SCFE0|5.0|I have always been interested in this movie since I heard about it.  When I realized I could get it, I jumped at the chance to see it.  I love a mystery and this one was fantastic.  When it was revealed, I was stunned.  I really didn't see that coming at all.  I'm happy I have this movie in my collection now.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This was an amazing app. It is totally worth the price. I reccomend this for everybody who thinks the price is too high, it is worth it. IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!! Buy it.

B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The audio and visuals were well done, that's about it. I thought it was unoriginal, incoherent, acting was subpar, story was pretty shallow, music was pretty cheesy. It was a very 'Hollywood' sci-fi movie, just trying to make money off shallow entertainment value. I was disappointed, although I didn't have high expectations. Honestly, this movie was laughable at some points. Teenage boys must have been the target audience.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Excellent! Easy to navigate and even easier to read. I'm well pleased with the Kindle and my ability to use it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A good read with lots of dramatic twists and turns that keep you reading.  It was hard to put down.
B00A81NFAS|1.0|This movie stole from so many others films & just mixed it all together. And they thought we wouldn't notice?  It's starts off as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, then ...Sling Blade, then ....the Albert Brooks film Modern Romance, then ends up as Strictly Ballroom. Really the movie itself was schizophrenic, kind of a mess, not great character development, a little flat. Why does Hollywood today just recycle, & in this case just borrow a little bit of from this film, a little of that ....from films that were great. This isn't a great movie, it was ok, it had a few moments here & there, but I've seen all those moments before,....  I would rather watch the original movies, they were ALL much better. ...and ORIGINAL.
B00BCX2F66|1.0|This case doesn't stand up as advertised.  It falls when I try to stand it up as advertised.  wasted money.
B00BAXFDLM|3.0|I would have liked to give this book 3.5 stars if possible, since it is above average space opera. There is a level of narrative and psychological complexity that is missing from most sci fi novels. The story follows an intelligence that was once part of a ship as it battles the Emperror of its universe and fights to bring about a better society. There are interesting characters and interweaved story lines that are handled skilfully. This is the author's first novel and it shows promise. In spite of this, however, the novel has several flaws. The quality of the writing falls off drastically in the last third of the book when it becomes a more hackneyed, action thriller. The ideas in the novel are not terribly original. The concept of an intelligent ship is derived from Iain Bank's Culture novels. The society conceived in the novel is also not a terribly interesting one. It is a feudal society with strict class heirarchies. These kinds of rigid societal structures are not robust and tend to fall apart in the face of technological or other changes (as we know from earth history). Ann Leckie's strength as a writer is characterization; I think she is best served by narrowing her canvas rather than working on such as a grand scale.
0385334206|4.0|It's all about style and humor with Vonnegut, and I suspect most readers won't be turned on by either his style or his humor. He's the quintessential \\"cult author\\" (despite making best seller lists).<br /><br />I love his style and humor, but I don't find his writing to be all that impressive. I read him because he makes me laugh, and this book has a lot of laughs. But you'll probably only find it funny if you're cynical and view the world as absurd. You'll also need a literary stomach for a disjointed, meandering narrative.<br /><br />The book definitely addresses big themes (eg race, free will, environmental destruction), so in that sense it has some heft. But it does so mostly in a collegiate way. Some of that is the nature of satire: when you're poking fun at serious things, you don't go in too deep, for fear of losing the humor or \\"explaining the joke.\\" But some of it is that Vonnegut is a little immature. (Does a 50-year-old author really need to tell us the penis length of all his male characters?)<br /><br />One of the things I loved (initially) was the way he would define an everyday concept, for humorous effect, as if explaining it to someone from another planet. (eg \\"A chicken is a flightless bird that looked like this\\": then he'd show a drawing of it.) It started to get a little gimmicky as the book went along, though. Another thing that was interesting but also a little gimmicky was the metafiction: in this case, the author referring to the fact that he was inventing and manipulating his characters in the story. But that element did fit in with some of the themes of the book: free will/humans as machines/creator of the universe.<br /><br />An inventive, funny book for those with a certain worldview and sense of humor.
B009AMANH4|1.0|I am so disappointed to write so negatively about Lincoln,  But It's like watching a History lesson, a really really really Boring one, the pace is so slow. watching politicians fight for 149 minutes is painful, flat, & such a drag. Yes Daniel Day Lewis looks just like Lincoln, but so what.? It's not enough to make you ENJOY this movie,Each scene feels like it’s taken straight out of a textbook, literally, with more emphasis on historical accuracy than engrossing narrative. It's just doesn't involve the viewer. The one bright spot was Sally Field who shines as Lincoln’s troubled and neglected wife Mary Todd she was the best thing about this otherwise flat movie, If you enjoy movies about the Lincoln period, watch The Conspirator, a Gripping period drama about revenge vs justice; politics vs war. Skip Lincoln it's just a beautifully shot waste of time
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was pretty good, fast paced and a great read. While reading the book the scenes and narratives played out really well in my head. I felt a few times that I had the book figured out but like Will Robie it just wasn't fitting together. As I was reading this book I felt like I was right beside Will Robie trying to figure out all this.<br /><br />Great read overall. I am a Lee Child/Brad Thor enthusiast and I was looking for a new character which I think I have defiantly found. Will Robie will keep you thinking, involved and you will make you feel as if you are right in the story with Robie.

B003JHKORK|1.0|If they would have had the courage to stick to the script it would have made even more money in the box office because people would have been happy to see it over and over again! Instead some idiot took Rick's well written book and pissed on it! They added things in the movie that never happened while leaving out the great things that did! Rick's book was like a history lesson (wish I would have had it when I was studying Greek Mythology). This movie was a parody and a sad one at that!<br /><br />Don't let that director near anything else you write Rick.

You can't skip the lengthy opening video sequences, and when the thing bogs down your device so much you have to restart the game every time, you end up watching it over and over.<br /><br />Deleted it promptly. Don't waste your time.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Unsympathetic characters and complete craziness going on in is book make it completely impossible to put down. As the past and the present converge to reveal what happened that terrible night, the book becomes more irresistible.

0385351399|1.0|Having read the reviews by critics stumbling over each other to praise how &#34;edgy&#34; and &#34;prophetic&#34; this book was, I borrowed it from the library (if I'd paid the ridiculous $17 for this book, I probably would have sat down and cried).<br /><br />The only thing good about this book is David Eggers writing ability.  He's clearly an extremely skilled writer and it's a credit to him that I managed to finish this to the end.  He could write about going to the bank and make it readable and interesting (and would probably be better than this book).<br /><br />The main character, Mae, brings to mind wooden, one-dimensional female characters such as Bella from Twilight and the central character of 50 Shades of Grey.  She's a plain, boring girl from Fresno but all men fall in love with her, everyone wants to be her friend, everything she does is amazing and exceptional, and everyone just finds her so fascinating.  She never question the increasingly ridiculous scenarios in the book.<br /><br />In fact, no one does.  Except for a couple dozen people in the entire world, EVERYONE is completely happy to have chips embedded in their children, cameras put in every room of their house, and mandatory enrollment in the system for everyone on Earth.  This book makes an Ayn Rand novel seem subtle and thoughtful.  It gets so ridiculous that halfway through it reads like a goofy book your Grandpa wrote about Interwebs Boogeyman.<br /><br />I also don't understand the people calling this a thriller.  It certainly builds up like one, hinting at an uprising of people against the Circle.  It builds and builds with increasingly stupid scenarios.<br /><br />Then it ends.  It hints at the start of a climax in the story arc and then 2 pages later it just ends, abruptly.  It's the first half of a book.  A $17 first half of a book.<br /><br />Please don't spend your hard earned money on this.  And hopefully Eggers goes back to writing solid books and stops this fascination with theOld White Male Authors Against The Internet club....

0880794968|4.0|Most books / internet pages refer to a rider-waite deck. There are some differences from deck to deck ( Original, Universal, Golden, Radiant, Albano etc.. etc.. ) But I find this one to be closest to a good original version but is also bright and easy to see the symbols etc. What made me purchase  this deck over golden or radiant is that the back was dark with pretty stars. I Also own the original deck and dislike it. The colors are awful you can't see what is going on in some of the more elaborate cards.. this deck is night and day from the original deck. Very pleased.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was very excited about this because I am a grand student and I watch a lot of documentaries and lectures on youtube. This gave me the ability to watch them on my 42 inch HD TV not just on my tablet and laptop! Simple to install, it was up and running in a matter of minutes. I am not very tekkie but I was able to set up my laptop and my tablet to run the Chromecast in a matter of a few minutes. We cut the cable cord at our house 2 years ago with the Roku now this just enhances our ability to enjoy &#34;free&#34; or cheap TV!

1481130331|5.0|Most books focusing on WW2 Europe depict the horrific labor and death camps, the inner workings of Hitler's Nazi government, or the Allies' determination to destroy Evil Incarnate.  But in Christoph's Fischer's \\"Luck of the Weissensteiners,\\" a different tale is told.  Beginning with the simple story of Greta, a young, beautiful Jewish Slavakian girl falling in love with a shy, Sudentenland German boy because of their mutual passion for books, the reader is quickly introduced to prejudice.  Slovakians resent Czechs and visa versa; Germans are a group to be revered and assimilated into; Jews are to be distanced from, particularly those of Greta's Ukraine lineage, and when Hitler passively enters the Czech Republic, Slovakians cheer in the streets. But then, slowly but surely, as the Allies invade Europe and Germany descends into complete turmoil, those prejudices switch at a moment's notice--hiding oneself as a Jew becomes a liability; Germans are the scum of the earth, Russians are to be feared, and speaking with a Czech accent in an after war displacement camp is ostracized.  Fascinating and extremely well thought out and a definite page-turner, this is a highly recommended read.<br /><br />S. R. Mallery, author
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game. I got it for free, and glad I did. Its not too hard, but does make you think. It is very satisfying when you eventually work out the correct solution. I play a few games every day and would gladly have paid for it.

B00DV2D0JC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The graphics were good and the storyline was interesting. I tried the &quot;free&quot; version of the game which really wasn't free. I bought the game on sale for $.99 and it was worth it.

1476727651|5.0|By now, everyone knows that \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is Stephen King's sequel to \\"The Shining\\" designed to answer the burning question, \\"Whatever Happened To Danny Torrance\\"?  After the terrible events at the Overlook Hotel in \\"The Shining\\", what became of young Danny, his mother Wendy, and Dick, the life saving cook?  \\"Doctor Sleep\\" answers those questions and provides the Constant Reader with a fascinating character study of a man anguished by his past, his paranormal ability, and his alcoholism intertwined with a white knuckle suspense thriller that, at times, has the reader setting the book down for a \\"breather\\".<br /><br />It's been 36 years since \\"the Shining\\", and Danny is not the same person nor is Stephen King the same writer--they have  both moved on in life.  \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is NOT a repeat nor a clone of \\"The Shining\\" which has seemed to disappoint some readers.  Rather it is an extension of the Danny Torrance character as he aged after the horrific events at the Overlook Hotel.  Danny is now Dan, known as Doctor Sleep, for his remarkable ability to help soften the deaths of patients at a hospice in New Hampshire where he ultimately settled after more than 30 years of roaming, drinking, and trying not to become his father.<br /><br />Early on, Dan becomes aware of a powerful individual with the most potent shine he has ever encountered and over the years, communicates with that person as she grows into a precocious 12 year old named Abra Stone.  Their interwoven fate is sealed when they discover a roving band of emotional vampires known as the True Knot who feed off the \\"steam\\" released by children with the shining when they are tortured to death resulting in greatly increased life spans and strength.  The True Knot is led by \\"Rose The Hat\\", the most powerful and, ultimately, the most flawed of the group.<br /><br />Rose discovers the hidden power of the young girl in New Hampshire and becomes obsessed with capturing her powerful steam setting in motion the tensionand suspense of King's well conceived story line.  It is up to Dan and a couple of friends to assist the untested and untrained  Abra in defending her life and, consequently, taking on the True Knot in an all or nothing battle.<br /><br />The characters of Dan, Abra, and other family and friends are fully fleshed and credible.  The characters of the True Knot are less developed but mainly because they are not the focus of the story outside of maybe Rose and The Crow.  There are occasional pacing problems but these are quickly forgotten when the suspense ratchets up whenever young Abra is threatened.  Read this if you enjoyed the vulnerability of young Danny in \\"The Shining\\" because his life afterwards is both shocking and sympathetic.  Read this if you enjoy great suspense wrapped around a struggle between good and evil.  And read this if you love great stories told by one of our generations greatest story tellers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is the best game I have ever got and its free its worth at least a dollar.
B00D48BSBA|3.0|A typical Forsyth - pacy, extraordinarily confident, well researched. I'm delighted that the master is still at his craft. A great read that I finished in two sittings. Difficult to put down. Highly recommended. Not as good as Day of the Jackal or Odessa File.<br /><br />The flaws are a matter of detail, and primarily about the lack of appreciation of the Middle-eastern mindset. 1. That an online preacher with no intermediary could wield such enormous influence is not credible. Yes, it is convenient for the plot. 2. Then, that this enormously influential preacher can be discredited by a five-minute broadcast is even less believable. Sounds like Bollywood. 3. The author raises the question \\"Why do they hate Americans?\\", and answers this complex question far too superficially, almost offhandedly.<br /><br />The flaws are perhaps more visible to Asian minds than to western ones. The book is really good, but is primarily about American and British intelligence. It's not about Islamic fundamentalism or the Preacher (the antagonist). Replace the Preacher with some megalomaniac criminal, and the story will work just as well.

B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The original Batman Begins was flawed but brought Batman back to life.  The Dark Knight was confused and uneven with too many subplots but Keith Ledger's (somewhat hammy) performance gave it energy. (Though I believe Ledger's death elevated the status for what was essentially an overrated movie).  But The Dark Knight Rises has little going for it.  The character of Batman appears for about 15 minutes of this 3hrs + pseudo epic  and he isn't particularly heroic.  The plot is a mess, full of contradictions, redundant sluggish and sloppy.  Nolan seems to love every frame he shoots and doesn't believe in editing. Bale is unlikable and unconvincing as a man  supposedly possessed with justice. SInce Nolan and Bale have taken a somber tone to their interpretations I believe audiences and critics alike WANT to embrace this Batman, as a statement against the campy silly Schmacher versions. That worked once.  But i have since have become  dreary and dull.  And the Dark Knight Rises  offers little more than eye assaulting CG's. If that works for you, see it. Otherwise...pass.
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|I'm a fan of the Marvel cinematic universe, so I really want to like MAOS.  The creative team is trying to establish connections to the Marvel movies while building a narrative that stands on it's own.  They are off to a good start, but do miss a brick or two in the foundation.  The ensemble is good, but they need to concentrate more on Coulsons story.  This show is drawing in viewers who love Phil Coulson from the movies.  It should be very Coulson centered, at least at first.  It's failure to directly answer questions about how Coulson lived through the events of Avengers up front could be off-putting, unless it's building up to a big twisty reveal.  They are at least giving hints in that direction.
1781162646|4.0|Another of Stephen King's creative writings, he develops his characters wonderfully and as a priority over his development of the supernatural backdrop.  Nowhere close to the depth and intensity of many of his novels, but an absolutely fun read.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Good play modes. Controls in the game are cool i only wish I could kick like that! Can't wait for the World Cup :-)
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The above title means that as part one of the Hobbit it was everything I was expecting it to be. But, expecting the wild action of the Lord of the Rings is not part 1 of this movie. The second part should be yet more spooky as most of the misadventures are later. It was a book written as a young adult novel and the target audience for the movie seems perfect. I had forgot a few bits and pieces of the story so I enjoyed it coming to the big screen very much. It was like a smorgasbord of the book in living color. Not to see it would be a shame for any Tolkien fan and perhaps once I see the conclusion I might have to give this back the fifth star. After all, rewatching the lord of the rings trilogy in succession was much more meaningful to me and upped my impression more each time I viewed them. If you want to see Gandalf, Smeagle/Gollum and feel like you have seen one more part of Tolkien's world, this movie is definitely for you.The plot is simple, the journey is not. It is terrible to wait a couple years for the rest of the story but watching shows like Game of Thrones should help one learn to have patience. Take yourself through the original dungeons and dragons experience and enjoy the show....shu

B000HKYBXA|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's version of &#34;Hamlet&#34; is gorgeously cinematic, and features some outstanding acting performances by himself, Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie and others (though there are some uneven acting and even miscasting among the stellar international cast). This complete 4-hour version feels not a minute too long, and is greatly enhanced by Alex Thomson's vivid cinematography and Patrick Doyle's atmospheric score. This is a model of how Shakespeare should be adapted for the big screen. Branagh's version of &#34;The Magic Flute&#34; is similarly cinematic and highly recommendable.

B00991TCOG|4.0|A good mix of classical violin and house/techno music. I enjoy listening to it in my car. Strongly recommended. She's very talented.
B00CX7OX6U|2.0|I have always enjoyed viewing films directed by Terence Malick. Until &#34;Tree of Life&#34; came along, he could do no wrong in my book. Sadly, this take on &#34;love among the ruins&#34; represents a downward-spiral in his creative energies. The principal actors appear to be as nonplussed about their roles as everyone else involved in this boring, self-indulgent mess.  I am not alone in voicing my disappointment. The viewer approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, for example, is less than 50%. Production values, including the cinematography and Hanan Townshend's music [some of which was replaced], are first-rate, however.

0061537969|5.0|I just finished reading this book at the suggestion of a friend.  I had my doubts at first.  Once I started the book, I was totally hooked.  I loved it from beginning to end and finished it in 2 days.  I loved the characters that I felt like you were supposed to love, Enzo, Denny, Eve, Zoe, Mike and Tony.  I even liked Mark Fein.  The characters you were supposed to hate, I hated.  I would LOVE a sequel to this book.  If I could give this book 10 stars, I would.  As a dog lover (and animal lover in general) I would whole-heartedly recommend this book.
B006S8QY8K|5.0|Loved this movie. It made me smile and laugh. It is a feel good movie that I could<br />watch over and over. I will probably purchase the DVD. Ever since Pretty Woman, I have<br />enjoyed Richard Gere's movies.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My friends told me I had to read this book.  That it was one of the best they'd ever read, that I'd fall in love with the characters, that it'd leave me feeling broken and sad, but that I'd love it just the same.  And so, I put it off for quite some time because I don't really enjoy being sad.  I also don't like to physically borrow books from the library because they aren't mine, and the ebook of this one was just too much money, in my opinion (at no point do I think ebook prices should be comparable to the paperback price).  But then there was a sale and the ebook was only $3.99 on Amazon, so I scooped it up and, one Friday evening not too long ago, started reading it.<br /><br />Initially, it didn't pull me in.  I wasn't in love with the characters, the plot was like so many I've read before, and I just didn't see what everyone was talking about (and I do mean everyone).  Hazel didn't tug on my heart strings--in fact, she was presented in a way that made me dislike her.  Catty and unforgiving, she jerks her parents around and has all but given up, even though she has a second chance at life.  I couldn't understand her.  Augustus was interesting, but he seemed unreal, almost forced to me, and I sighed and thought this was going to be one of those instances where I just didn't feel the same as the whole world around me.<br /><br />And then, at some point while I was reading (and I honestly can't pinpoint it), I became irrevocably attached to the characters.  Augustus seems to bring out the best in everyone around him, and Hazel's snark stopped getting on my nerves and I began to love her, and all those around her.  They jumped off the page and became real.  And then, as John Green has a tendency to do, he ripped out my heart and left me blubbering for hours into the night, blowing my nose, soaking my shirt in tears, hiccupping for breath.  The Fault in Our Stars is just that touching, and it truly left me breathless.  And while I didn't fall in love with the story right away, I definitely did fall in love with it.  My friends were right, as they usually are.  This is an amazing novel and I highly suggest you read it if you haven't.  I just hope the movie rendition does it justice, because this is a very powerful piece.right away, I definitely did fall in love with it.  My friends were right, as they usually are.

He delves at length into the control, aspects and nuclear safety concerns of our arsenal.

B000BISBDY|5.0|I love this DVD. Its Johnny at his best from old to new. My young daughter who loves modern music from top 40 to the new country didn't seem to feel the same way about Johnny's style so it must be good because today's music stinks in my opinion. If you like Johnny Cash this item is for you.
