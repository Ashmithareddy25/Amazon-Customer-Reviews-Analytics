B0095XPZBC|1.0|Having been blown away by the quality of the season 1 release, I was very excited to get season 2.  Then I was sad.  If the re-mastering of the Star Trek TNG blu-rays was a classroom assignment, it seems like the people who did season 1 are the kids who sat in the front row and gave it their best effort, and the studio responsible for season 2 sat in the back of the class and just did the minimum that was required.<br />The first season re-mastering is phenomenal.  The enhanced effects, sounds, and high quality HD make it well worth the money I paid for it.  The second season is pretty much like watching the DVDs with a player that can sharpen details and change the depth of contrast.  I'm considering returning them and getting my money back from Amazon.  As a long time Star Trek TNG fan, this is very disappointing, and it kind of pisses me off.  I've only watched 2 disks so far, but from what I've seen the best looking parts of the entire set is the LCARS menu.<br />I did some research and found out what everyone seems to already know.  The odd numbered seasons are the ones that they gave to a studio that would do them justice, and the odd numbered seasons were given to, I have to assume, a studio that is run by a relative of the person who made the decision of whom to give the seasons to.  If you like to pay more money for things than they are worth, then by all means buy season 2.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love this one.  I'm not as fond of the others, but this one is cute.  Easy though as we are already to level 17 on the deathstar and have only had it for a short time.  I hope they keep adding to this.

B0086700CM|4.0|My daughter and I like this.  Great graphics.  I jut wish you didn't have to go all the way to the beginning when you failed.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|For years I had the usual favorite movies that everyone else has....Dirty dancing, Grease, Ghost, Princess bride...etc.....But this one, is the first new Movie I have added to my list in years. It definitely is not for everyone, it isn't funny, a musical, scary, or edge of your seat, nail biting...BUT if you have any interest in Autism,  it is heart-warming, touching, very intersting and inspirational, and best of all, a TRUE STORY! My husband works with all sorts of childhood disorders which of course made this film hit home for us. I think for the confidence building, and the \\"you can be anything\\", problem solving, \\"when life hands you lemons\\";, aspect of this film alone, it should be a viewing requirement in every high-school! As well as a training tool for anyone who works with, is raising, or caring for anyone who suffers with this complex and often misunderstood disease/disorder.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|The writing itself was good, premise interesting.  However, I pretty much had it figured out half way through the book, so was not shocked by the ending.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Warning!!  Warning!! This game is very addictive! Flow free is a fantastic puzzle game.  I have literally spent hours not wanting to quit. I give it five stars.

B002SEW5WW|5.0|I was motivated to look at this CD after hearing some of the songs several times on Pandora. I am very pleased with the purchase. I think I like all the songs on the CD.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|Some points about this album, good & bad. Start with the bad(since it`s the shorter list): some of the same problems that have marred previous releases are still present. Number 1 is, in this age of over-compressed \\"loudness wars\\", SS are some of the worst offenders. The modern trend of compressing everything to the max takes out a vital dynamic. The music can`t \\"breathe\\", therefore becomes a little tiresome and runs together. But this is better than their previous release; the songs have more of an individual identity here. Number 2: Corey Taylor is, frankly, a horrible lyricist. He`s a tick better here than previous efforts, but still, the lyrics are rather juvenile and contrived. Now to the good stuff: the album is absolutely BURSTING with killer riffs ! The music is fantastic, full of hooks, and top-notch instrumentation - they REALLY show their chops ! And Taylor just keeps getting better as a vocalist; he is, with this release, the absolute top dog metal frontman !!! And I like how most of the songs are arranged into couplets, with one segueing into it`s counterpart - very nice touch ! Because of the compression / production issue, I have a feeling that SS are waaay better live than on record, so I will jump at the chance to catch them in `13. With a little less heavy-handedness at the mixing board, and a little better result in the lyrics dept., SS could be the new Metallica, releasing classic albums that last generations and separating themselves from the pack by a huge margin. This album is definitely a step in that direction, and despite it`s flaws, is the best metal album I`ve picked up in ages - a must-have !
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Night Circus was a fun read. A love story with magic, interestingly flawed characters. I liked the crafting of the story - clever and paced nicely.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very addicting game, everyone in my family loves it and is addicted to it. But I prefer to play it on a tablet, more fun.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|My husband is addicted to this series and rather than pay for months of a cable station we don't really watch much else on, we buy the DVD sets.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|The movie was slow at parts, but very smart and thought-provoking.  The ending leaves the viewer curious and begs for a sequel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really enjoyed reading the book after seeing the movie, a must read for anyone who saw the movie.  Also an easy read
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I love movies based on real things that have happened and this movie is great!  I watch it often!  Nicole Kidman & Hugh Jackman play great roles.
B001FB563E|4.0|I've read most of Cormac McCarthy's work, and The Road was the one that got me started (I have a soft spot for post-apocalyptic fiction).<br /><br />The movie is a pretty good version of it, though I found it more hopeful than the book. Didn't care for the additional scenes for the wife (Charlize Theron); not that they were bad in and of themselves - just felt like they were added out of a sense of &#34;we need a female character&#34; or &#34;we need some degree of love story&#34; rather than a story-driven need.<br /><br />One caveat in terms of purchasing the movie - I doubt many people would want to see this multiple times just due to the dark subject matter. No mark against the movie itself - I just don't believe there's a lot more taken from it over repeated viewings and it is fairly depressing.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality were very good to my eyes and ears (much better than in the theatre, actually).
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This is the first I heard of Imagine Dragons and if you want to hear something a little different buy this album! Every track is worth the money. its an eclectic mix of sound, harmonics, and lyrics! And you've probably heard \\"Its Time\\" on the xbox commercial! Enjoy this album
B004EPYZUI|4.0|On seeing the theatrical trailers, I remember thinking &#34;That chain gun wielding samurai looks pretty cool&#34; but that the movie just sort of looked like it would be a loud mess. Decided to skip seeing it in the theatre (sadly, much pickier about which movies I'll see in the theatre than I was 20 years ago).<br /><br />I ended up catching the movie on cable and was really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It's not a great movie by any stretch, but it's eye and ear candy. Some of the imagery & action sequences are really just amazing to watch and I greatly enjoyed the soundtrack paired with the visuals. I liked it enough that I bought the BlueRay so I could see it in full high definition with great sound - and I was NOT disappointed.<br /><br />I convinced my wife to watch with me and her review was &#34;It's like a teenage boy's fantasy come to life.&#34; She didn't exactly dislike it and there were elements that she did like (some of the music and, again, some of the imagery). However, the long action sequences definitely did not have the same draw for her.<br /><br />Perhaps a good litmus test of whether you should spend the time/money on this movie: Does the idea of a slight, sword wielding woman fighting 3 giant samurai make you think &#34;neat&#34; or does it make you groan?<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed the soundtrack (particularly the new versions of &#34;Sweet Dreams,&#34; &#34;White Rabbit&#34; and &#34;Where is my Mind&#34; enough that I also bought the soundtrack.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|It catches you from the begining and you won't be able to stop reading.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know a thing about memory competitions. It will amaze you.

B009O2XY12|1.0|I hated the way it would only let you play if you had 'energy' and you only got energy if you waited 30 min or won a game. If you lost you were out SOL. You could buy a bonus but then you can't use it. There is no button to press and it does not just apply it to your reserves. Overall a frustrating and silly game.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games was really for teens or preteens and did not hold up to any mature adult interesting plot.  Would not buy it again if I had it to do over again.
B008Z9L94O|3.0|this is an outstanding box. The packaging is top-notch and, largely, the mix and mastering is a huge improvement One thing that the previous 5-Star reviews do not mention, however, is the absolute BUTCHERING done to the song Zero. That song is so overcooked that there is constant clipping from the first instant all the way through its 2 minutes, 40 seconds. I hope that this is a manufacturing defect and that it will be fixed on the next pressing.<br /><br />--updated 08/2017 After many listens: all of the songs on the inner grooves of every disc suffer from the same distortion, though maybe not in as large amounts, before their end.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I first read this book several years ago and it's the first one I ever finished reading & immediately turned back to page 1 to begin reading it again.  I read it a third time just before seeing the movie.  It was still a delight.  It has meaning on several levels.  As a person who works in a zoo I can reassure you of the accuracy of the comments regarding wild animal behavior.  I don't want to ruin it for you - just recommend you read it & enjoy!

0330449605|3.0|This book has enough intrigue in it to keep one turning the pages. It's a generational story and accordingly jumps among time frames, uncovering  secrets with each revisit. The novel focuses upon three women, whose lives are gradually plaited together:  Eldest is Eliza, an English author of fairy tales. Second is Nell, who makes the trip from London to Australia solo, seemingly abandoned aboard ship, at age 4. And third Cassandra, Nell's granddaughter, who presides over Nell's deathbed in Brisbane in 2005, then ventures to Cornwall to solve the mystery of Nell's origins. The other characters, several of whom are improbable villains, are relatively shallow. It's hard to imagine why Eliza was so devoted to her cousin, Rose, or how Rose managed to attract her husband Nathaniel, an American artist and illustrator of Eliza's fairytales. Nell also has inconsistencies of character not easy to accept, despite her mysterious beginnings.  There are moments of enchantment--secret gardens, after all, are great material for novels.  The fairytale connection is also engaging. But the author might have done more with period settings and historical backgrounds.  Enough to engage, but only on the surface, and in passing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book. I found it to be an easy read.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Rarely does a book just ruin my daily routine like Wool did. I just had to keep reading to find out what happened next. The writing here is masterful. The characters are well developed and revealed to us in just the right way, not too fast, not too slow. The story is so rich and so compelling. As I read it, I just kept picturing it as a movie. An what do I find out just before writing this review: Ridley Scott has acquired the movie rights!<br /><br />If you like Sci-Fi, or you just love a great read, pick up a copy of wool...and oh yeah, put your life on hold for a few days. You'll see.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I'm disappointed in the pop-up ads since I paid the premium for my new Kindle Fire HD that was supposed to eliminate these annoying ads.  The game itself is great.  If the ad free version is available for Kindle devices I's suggest you pay the difference.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|You should be able to type in the word that you are looking for or be able to type in the first few letters of the word. And other then it is a very handy book to have on your kindle. If you can its just my kindle. Thank you.
B008I34YYY|5.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers.  This movie is really, really funny!  And I am someone who actually likes Sarah Palin, who gets made fun of fairly mercilessly.  The film is camp and silly at times, but with some compelling (if deliberately stereotypical) characters and very nice performances by all of the actors.  I think it actually has a worthwhile message, too.  So I recommend it highly and without reservation.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Just so you know, this is the definitive version. There was a previous DVD/bluray release that came out too dark, so they fixed it, and re-released it.<br /><br />Now on to the real review...<br /><br />The original Eva was a landmark series, and I am a great big fan of Evangelion (I own the series, the movies, the Manga, etc). I don't believe in trying to sell people on my fandom, but I want to give my honest review of this movie.<br /><br />What should be made clear is this is not a good starting point. The movie is an abridged version of the first six episodes of the series, so the pacing feels off. The movie assumes you're already familiar with the characters, so it tries to get to the interesting parts quicker.<br /><br />Some of the most ardent Eva fans might say they dumbed it down. Made more action-y. Things that were only hinted at before get boldly explained. The truth is, there will be no time to talk about it later.<br /><br />I was tempted to give it a 4, because it's not friendly to new viewers, but I was thoroughly impressed by the movie's visuals. This is not a simple HD up-scaling of the TV series. They went back to the drawing board and remade the series.<br /><br />-All new animation.<br />-Digital Ink.<br />-Widescreen.<br />-HD Quality.<br /><br />Oh, my god, it looks FREAKING BEAUTIFUL! You have to get it on Bluray, and the bigger screen, the better. Don't settle for DVD.<br /><br />Very few Anime get this type of treatment, so if you're already an Eva fan, and you'll want to add this to your collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg this is an awesome game but now the game is giving me stars if I would rate 1 to 10 it would defiantly it would be 10.
0060589280|5.0|I first picked up Paul Coelho's most popular book The Alchemist, and liked it. Then I decided to read 11minutes and it was even better!!! I absolutely loved this book, it sucked me right in to the young girl's story!
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Bought the Blu-Ray for myself, and 5 copies of the DVD versions as gifts for Christmas.... My Blu-Ray disc had a dimple in it, which made it stop playing during Kashmir...<br />Disappointing, needless to say... Replacement Blu-Ray is on its way. (It came 4 days later-- Quick service!)  5 stars for the Concert itself, 1 star for the Blu-Ray pressing process.<br /><br />The CDs included with the DVD / Blu-Ray have been playing in my car for 3 plus weeks now.  Cannot get enough of Zeppelin at the moment.<br /><br />After watching MOST of the 121212 concert, the Stones, The Who, Roger Waters, and any of the OLDER Rockers have NOTHING on the remaining 3 Members of Led Zeppelin and John Bonham's son Jason.<br /><br />Jason Bonham is incredible on Drums, you can close your eyes and see Bonzo behind the Drum kit....  Jason IS his Father's Son...  Fantastic in every way.<br /><br />Robert Plant's voice is still as powerful as it was 30+ years ago.  Can't say that for Daltry --in my opinion anyway.  Plant's voice wavers/cracks at ONLY 3 points during the entire show.  For a man who was almost 60 at the time of the recorded Performance ...  I'd say that's pretty good.  Daltry and Jager sounded pretty bad during the 121212 concert in my opinion.<br /><br />Jimmy Page is as fluid and good as ever. I cannot add anything to describe this performance that hasn't been written 10,000 times in the past about Jimmy Page and his guitar work.  In a word, Amazing.<br /><br />If George Harrison was the QUIET Beatle, then John Paul Jones is the QUIET member of Led Zeppelin.  Seldom heard from-- however such an integral force behind the Zeppelin sound, both on Bass and more so on Keyboards.  The iconic sounds which come from Jones' part of the stage are magical.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the greatest Rock and Roll band ever.... than this DVD or Blu-Ray DVD is something you need to own.  It will not disappoint.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I pre-ordered this book because I am a Tom Clancy fan.  I also don't mind that Clancy co-author's with others, I think that is good mentoring technique, or at least I like to think so.<br /><br />Threat Vector is a great read, it starts out fast and picks up steam and continues on until the climax.  I have enjoyed the new team of Clark, Chavez, Jack Ryan, Jr. and Dominic Caruso as well as Sam Driscoll.  This team works well together and they all want the same thing, to bring the hurt to Terrorist and keep America safe.  But this book starts out with them seeking a little bit of revenge, they want to give some payback for the death of Dominic's brother, Brian.  They get what they want, but a whole lot more.<br /><br />Jump from this to the President of China and his internal problems with the Politburo and you add another dimension to a story that will weave it's way through multiple layers of spies, multiple countries, and a bunch of government hacks that will cause you to have some serious nervousness.<br /><br />This book will leave you thinking about where the world is headed and how might it end up if good men decided to sit out the next problem and let evil run it's course.<br /><br />I imagine that Greaney did a major portion of the writing of this book, if that is the case then I think that he is maturing as writer and that he is delivering the goods that Clancy fans will enjoy.  This is another LONG, EPIC book, like you have become use to from Clancy.  But I believe you will enjoy it and not be sad that you paid a few bucks out for a good entertaining novel.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0345803485|3.0|OK, there are many different opinions on this book and therefore I made my choice to read and judge for myself. I agree with most that there are many variously descriptive scenes that takes this book from innocent love story level to a kinky sex novel. Yes there are many of those as well, however no one can deny that it was not at times entertaining to read about things people can succumb or think of?<br /><br />I agree that this book also have many repetition and therefore made it into a larger volume then needed. However the repetitions were done to denote that characters at times had to convince or refresh their memories as well as for the sake of the reader in those cases.<br /><br />All in all - long read of hot sexy scenes, if one is not interested they should not read it!
B008SOS63S|5.0|I played this cd for my 92 year old mother and I didn't think that she could still move like that!  Joe's blues takes her back to her early years of going to private clubs and juke joints to listen to the local boys play on Friday nights.  Midnight Blues is our favorite song.  And, now that Joe's returning to Seattle next year, I have our tickets for a Friday night date with my mom.  I don't know how I'm going to keep her in her seat.<br /><br />I play my music a little louder than she likes, but she doesn't complain if it's Joe.  I sure hope that she doesn't break anything.  Joe keeps getting better and Mom keeps getting younger.  Thank you Joe for her memories!  See you in April!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have not been impressed with John Grisham's novels for a long time, but this one got rather good reviews and I wznted to find out if he has recaptured the grist of his eariest novels.  Well, all most.  fHe still writes endless laundry lists of unimportant details, padding his book, but those are easy to skip over.  It started out slow and I was getting pretty bored, but then it took off.  Really good trwists and turns, unexpected developments, which cannot be described without giving away the plot.  It was cleverly crafted and almost plausible.....but I do not require plausibility in a crime novel, or one would never  be written.  A good read.

Yes, Worth the time, I think so - But leave your logic circuits at half mast at best.<br /><br />Definitely not what I'd call the best season of the series, but still compared to Moonshiners or Hog Pickers, gotta say I've enjoyed it.<br /><br />Different thing here is that previous seasons I've bought I've gone back and watched several times.  This one, not so much.<br /><br />Plus, Fox has now started incorporating very loud commercials that I get intermittently with the streaming.<br /><br />Nothing better than sitting late at night, kick  in the show, then have an obnoxious ad blast away at you at full volume.<br /><br />Doubt I'll get another Fox video for that reason, their products aren't that good.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|Being succinct - if you enjoy well-written, character driven fantasy novels, you'll enjoy Red Country. You'll get more out of it if you've read the other Abercrombie books, but I genuinely don't believe it's necessary for a good experience.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|Fine quality timepiece.  I have several Seiko watches and they all still work flawlessly.  The solar diver looks great and functions great.  You just cannot beat these watches,  and I do not have to change batteries.  Thanks Seiko!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|Didn't use to full capacity as far as data transfer, but I can write faster.  I guess I am old fashion when it comes to a list.  Not an easy thing to use at grocery store.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It was great for the whole family, my wife even liked it and said she'd see it again and she doesn't like to watch movies.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|Very nice and small. Had some trouble to close band correctly, but found it out pretty fast. Hope will stay nicely black
B005EY2XFC|1.0|This rating isn't for the movie at all, it's for the marketing of this product.  I was led to believe I was ordering a Blu-ray and Digital copy.  It is just the Blu-ray, which I would not have ordered if it didn't have the digital copy included.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It wasn't the most awesome movie but it was entertaining and I gave it two thumbs up at the end.
0061438294|5.0|bought this book for my dad at his request. he seems to like it so i'll assume it was worth it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Good game! I had played before on my PC but didnt realize it. Nevertheless I enjoyed it again. Cant wait for another like it.
0316044695|5.0|Could not put the book down. I guess books like this will make people want to be navy seals. What a hero! A very interesting perspective on the Afghans in the mountains that were willing to sacrifice their village to save one of US
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Do you want to see why Agent K is so quiet?  Do you want to see what Agent J would do for his partner?  Then buy this movie and find out for yourself.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|BORING!!!!! Fell asleep halfway through. Terrible movie from the beginning. Do not recommend it at all!  Waisting your time watching this.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.  Great set of characters and a good story line as well.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|love this movie so got as a gift for my sisters kids. Came all sealed and all. Plan on getting another one.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a really engaging story. The characters were cool, interesting. It was an easy and really enjoyable read. Thumbs up.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Great book about searching for personal identity.  Kate Morton always writes from the heart and lets you see into the souls of the main characters.
0547884591|5.0|As an educator I actually bought the book to learn more about Tim's take on meta-learning. What I didn't expect was how quickly that focus devolved into a bit of an obsession with the cooking. There's too much useful information in this book, too many fun things you can't wait to try, and my summer vacation is too far away!
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Christoph Fischer's The Luck of  the Weissensteiners , was an epic and impressive read.  The amount of research the author must have put into writing this story was evident by the well thought out and described times in time when geography was redirected by reigns of terror in Germany, in Russia, in the hearts of others that could watch nations of peoples, families torn apart and displaced. What starts out as a love story, a metaphor beginning in the spring of a young couple lives moves into the dark themes of our human shadow, where love turns to distrust and betrayal.<br />This is a story of intolerance at its worst, but is also a story of the strength of the human spirit to help and do good at great risk. While parts were too overly narrative for my taste the story and oppression of the time were never lost on the read, which kept me involved in this story, that by the time I was half way into the story I wanted to take time off to sit and finish it, to find out what happened to all the characters in their struggle to escape and survive. Sadly, like all of life there is much sorrow and loss, reality, but there is also survival and hope. I will not forget this read for a while to come.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I am the first one to.<br /> coment. about this app and I think its going to be awesome but I have to wait to find out but I think its going to be worth the wait
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|I have always admired Harriet Potter for her art talent and bravery<br />in a time when women were not readily accepted in the business world.<br />This movie portrayed everything I thought she was.  The actors were<br />great  the costumes & staging were incredible.  L
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele and this album will not disappoint those of you who love her talent and her music.  All of the songs are beautifully written and performed and the arrangements are wonderful.  I am looking forward to more of her music.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Another great book by Cornwall!  Just could not put it down.  She Is a wonderful author.  I will buy more of her books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is honestly the best book I have ever read. I finished it in one night! It's a very honest book, written as letters to an anonymous person. You can definitely find a character in the book to relate with. I was crying through most of it because it hit on so many emotions/memories. I watched the preview for the movie and was highly disappointed. The way I pictured the characters in my mind was much different, and in my opinion, more accurate. Read this book! You will not regret it.
0525953728|5.0|Lets u see the inside operations of the Seals and what it takes  to make this selection group of dedicated heros. Not a look at what &#34;I&#34; did, a team effort throughout. Book and seller A++++.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My kids are ages 3 and 5. They love these types of games. It doesn't last very long but keeps them entertained for a while.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I have a large amount of respect for Johnny Depp. He leads the cast down a dark but fun romp through the mists. He guides his dysfunctional descendants to the path of recovery and reminds them what it means to be a loving caring family no matter your faults.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Interesting read regarding the Dr's coma exper4ience.To get another perspective I recommend reading A Christian Rebuttal for a Biblical answer regarding life after life. The Dr's experience while in his coma does not gel with Biblical theology.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|This is a Tim Burton classic and a must have for anyone with children or just kids at heart. I have finally added this to my collection, and about time too.
B008K3HRF0|1.0|About the movie.  We love it.! It looks great on blu ray. Funny movie!<br /><br />About the instant video. Stay away from it. The quality is horrible whenever a lot of the animation is being played on both pc and on the tv.  I am very disappointed with the instant video and I am unable to get a refund from it. The quality of the movie is bad on Instant video.
0767903862|5.0|Imagine with me if you will a crowded subway train en route to Washington DC during rush hour in the morning of a normal work day. Suits, dresses, and the ubiquitous smart phone abound. Every now and then you'll see a trend-buster surprisingly reading a real newspaper, but he is the anomaly. And I will tell you that the unwritten rule of these trains is that you may not speak, acknowledge, or so much as mumble a word to another passenger. Heaven forbid you actually say \\"Good Morning\\" to another human being. Any attempt at conversation or minor disruption is frowned upon and you are immediately admonished by the masses. Well image the shock and horror of my co-passengers day in and day out as I shook uncontrollably with laughter whilst tears of joy flowed down my cheeks as I read \\"In a Sunburned Country\\". Yes, I was an outcast. But instead of heeding the non-verbal queues of \\"Stop this behavior at once!!!\\", I continued reading and allowed myself to smile and make strange gargling/chuckling noises as I read Bill's hysterical words.<br /><br />Now I must tell you that not all of this book is pure comedy. Only parts of it are. But I will tell you that this book was a pure joy to read. While I thought Mr. Bryson hit a homerun with \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", a ground ball single with \\"A Short History\\", and a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth with \\"Life and Time of....\\", he did something much, much more with this one. You will learn more fascinating facts and stories about Australia than you could ever have imagined. Why would you want to do this, you ask? Well I asked myself that same question, but persevered none the less and was rewarded in ways I cannot explain.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book. You will be hooked by the 5th page. And brace yourself for the story of how Bill fell asleep in his friend's car. It one for that will not soon be forgotten....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I chose this because my friends all insisted!<br />This series is the best I have ever written! Please, write more!!!
B008FOB124|5.0|I have loved them forever and after a long hiatus they return with this awesome collection of music.  I love every track and the vocals between Brendan and Lisa are so well balanced.  I highly recommend you add this album to your collection if you don't have it yet.  If you are new to Dead Can Dance this is a great place to start, but then you'll have to get their entire back catalog.
B008KE3960|5.0|Very strong game, especially on the Kindle Fire. Unlike normal tower defense your towers move and as a result, the game requires much more precision and attention
0399534601|4.0|As an inexperienced individual in the world of art, this book was extremely helpful for me.  It opened up a different way for me to understand art, what makes art, and how seemingly random objects can be used to create meaning.  Having spent some time learning primarily about contemporary art, I was able to gain greater insight to artists' works with the suggestions Keri gives throughout her book.  If you're looking for an advanced look into exploring the world this probably isn't your book, but for the beginner curios about growing and understanding it's perfect!
0547884591|5.0|Great book, already bought 2 copies as gifts for friends. It's great as a coffee table book, lots of useful recipes but most important is how it teaches you to learn new things, not just cooking.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|It was a cute little read, did not take long!<br />It was a free download, so I gave it a try!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Easy to play. Somewhat challenging. Great time-passer for kids and adults. Have a 2 year old and 5 year old that really like this game. Works well on the Google Nexus 7 tablet.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I like the solving the crime shows.  I just wish Castle and Beckett would finally get married.  You can tell they want to, but the writers keep dragging it out.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It's not really made for two year olds, but she's figured out some of the basic concepts of the game. Good graphics. Logic and building type game. Good challenges.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I didn't think I was going to read another Grisham book after having been a bit disappointed and bored by his few last novels.. The Racketeer is of the same breed as The Firm, Pelican Brief and so on. Thanks John!!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|Great series! Well acted with great story line.Many twists and turns!Jessica Lange's acting is fantastic! Very much deserves all the awards she is taking home.
B009EELNTK|5.0|Love this movie, teaches us to believe in things we don't think are possible, a very good job of showing how to trust ohers
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Love that Twitch had a bigger role if this film and that Kathyrn was lead. Again, this is the best Step Up movie yet!
B0053O89WY|4.0|I enjoyed watching this season and patiently await the next season's release onto dvd. . . . . . .
B009MB682W|4.0|All current James Bond theme songs included here minus Adele's &#34;Skyfall&#34; theme, which momentarily seemed rather odd, given that the album released at about the same as the movie did. Anyhow, a good value for the price.
B0072KZ0Z6|4.0|I enjoyed watching this show. I look forward to buying the next season on DVD when it comes out. .
B007HACDLK|5.0|This was a book that held my interest from the beginning.  With all the recent news about the CIA, it proved to be a timely read.  Can the American people accept the code these 'spokes' live by?  Perhaps it is best all the details are 'classified'.
0307352145|5.0|My title can be a little bit misleading, because there still is debate over whether personality is mostly fixed or largely changable. I believe it's both so saying \\"who you really are\\" isn't incorrect, but perhaps doesn't tell the whole story.<br /><br />The introduction of this book is beautiful:<br /><br />\\"<br />***<br />Introversion--along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness--is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology. Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man's world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we've turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel must conform.<br />***<br />But we make a grave mistake to embrace the Extrovert Ideal so unthinkingly. Some of our greatest ideas, art, and inventions--from the theory of evolution to van Gogh's sunflowers to the personal computer--came from quiet and cerebral people who knew how to tune in to their inner worlds and the treasures to be found there. Without introverts, the world would be devoid of:<br />the theory of gravity<br />the theory of relativity<br />W. B. Yeats's \\"The Second Coming\\"<br />Chopin's nocturnes<br />Proust's In Search of Lost Time<br />Peter Pan<br />Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm<br />The Cat in the Hat<br />Charlie Brown<br />Shindler's List, E. T., and Close Encounters of the Third Kind<br />Google<br />Harry Potter\\"<br /><br />It seems that true introverts and extroverts are rare. Someone who seems to be an introvert can behave paradoxically at time to his/her behavior and look like an extrovert. Maybe the idea of this book isn't always very practical as there are no strict models for personality. This might be my only criticism, but it's not toward Susan Cain personally because the science of psychology is probably the most difficult.<br /><br />What makes the topicso interesting to me? I've struggled with the Extrovert Ideal myself. As a teenager, I didn't have confidence to be myself and I felt I needed to be popular and social to be a successful person. So this topic is close to my heart. A good book has to touch you emotionally and this definitely does.
0374203032|4.0|This book isn't about what you can't buy.  It's what the author believes people ought to think about before allowing everything to have a price.  Allowing all aspects of humanity to be bought and sold has consequences.  All issues have at least 2 sides and a persons view can be (IMHO) shown in the following statements:  1) The more we take the power to choose away from individuals, the more we diminish the meaning of, and opportunity for, individual responsibility.  2) This is a symptom of a social climate in which \\"all standards by which behaviors are judged are simply matters of opinion.\\"<br /><br />Remember, \\"Guns don't kill people, people do.\\"  I thought enough of this book to buy another of the author's books - Justice.
0345525558|4.0|The book is about an insecure kids bouncing between fosterhomes, but she acts tough and doesn't let on that she's hurting. She is passionate about flowers and their meanings and it gets her far in life! Four and a half stars.. sometimes you get frustrated with her because she doesn't let anyone love her.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|They appear to be running out of new material.  It has to be tough to stay on top but you can't do it by recycling the same sound.  Reminds me of UB40 and Red, Red Wine.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Hey,<br />I am a huge fan of Nathan Fillion all the way back to his &#34;Firefly&#34; days. I love the cast of Castle and I'm going to acquire all of it eventually. Buy it.
0790742780|5.0|Michael Douglas portrays a man that has just endured the last straw.  Snap goes the camels back.  However, sometimes compounding bad decisions with more bad decisions has to come to a conclusion.  To me the best part is when they try to take his briefcase that only holds his lunch and beats the crap out of the guys.  Or only paying 50 cents for the soda.  Awesome movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series never disappoints. Keeps you on the edge of your seat every step of the way. My only complaint is that they take such a long break in the middle of the season. I can't wait for February.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I couldn't put my KFHD down while playing this game. The graffics are amazing, the music is lovely and it really makes you think. I saw this app was available for free app of the day and downloaded it. For the most part I only download free apps, unless its something I need, but I would have paid for this app!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is the first on in this series we have read and really enjoyed it as well.  We are reading Kid Lawyer now and like it as well.  Can't wait for the next one in May to come out.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I was the typical good girl and fell in love with the typical bad boy almost ten years ago so I can relate to the story! I absolutely love this book!!! The characters and story line are amazing! What girl in their right mind would push the hottest bad boy on campus away?! NO ONE :) Love LOve LOVe LOVE IT!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|We have read all of John Grishom's books and love them all.  They are intriguing and keep you wanting to read more.  We are reading the Theodore Boone books now and love them as well.  Can't wait until he has a new one out.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|A must have for your 3D collection.  Nonstop excitement.  Don'<br />t ask too many questions and just enjoy.  No disappointment.
B005O7PXNS|3.0|We loved season 1 and season 2 while season 3 was good but at times got silly. This season is similar to season 3. Some episodes are very good, some are fun but silly. Still good, still recommend it but with a little hesitation.
B004K6MGHK|4.0|I'm a big Natalie Portman fan and she plays this part extremely well.  It wasn't what I expected but I'm glad I got it.  It took a while to figure it out but then I wanted to watch it again and see what I missed.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Great historical romance!  Great characters to fall in love with!  Can't wait for more Jamie and Claire!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!
B003UESJHE|5.0|If you like seeing the challenges that face people and all they have to go thru to overcome them, you'll love this movie.  There's something in this movie for everyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead has by far become one of my favorite shows to watch. The writer always leaves you wanting more. There's action love and drama all tied into this movie and we absolutely love it.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|We rented the  movie and streamed it through the Roku.  It worked great and we really enjoyed the movie.  Love being able to stream movies from home without a trip out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its a lot like the show! it keeps u busy for a while! I like the different charecters and mini games!
B006BAEQB2|3.0|I have really enjoyed This series of books an they have all been interesting, however it wasn't like some of them where I couldn't put it down.  It does however have a bit more overlap if you've read the other books as it tell the same story from a different perspective through parts.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This a &#34;Russian Doll&#34; of a novel.  Many layers appear throughout the book.  The counter point between the characters of the writer and an MI6 agent was compelling.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|The DVD came quickly and was just as listed in the ad. Haven't opened package yet, it's a gift, but it seems in good shape.
160094048X|5.0|I purchased this book about 2 years ago shortly after I went vegan. I have only made 3 recipes out of this book. My daughter & I decided to try a recipe once a month, start at the beginning & work our way through. Well, the first recipe is for chocolate chip cookies (pg 35) ... and we continue to make a batch every month! They are so good! I've even add shredded coconut & once used a bit of coconut flour when I ran out of all purpose flour. They always come out great! I made my second recipe, caramel pecan bars (pg 111) for Thanksgiving & they were a hit. I really miss pecan pie & thought these would be a good substitute & they are & I don't think they're a sweet as pecan pie. All the \\"non\\" vegans loved them. Then last week I made the roll-and-cut sugar cookies (pg 222). I made them the night before since they needed to chill & then because I was running late (meeting grand kids @ Christmas parade)I just rolled them into balls by hand & baked. They were good & not too sweet so they'd be great w/ frosting & decorations. I will be trying these again & rolling them out & using cookie cutters.<br />Yes, I would recommend this book & I have. I have a few other cookbooks by this author & all are very good.  I also check out her web site from time to time when I'm wanting a new idea for dinner or something for a pot luck that everyone will eat & not complain about it being vegan!<br />One last thing I really like about the recipes in this cookie/bars cookbook is that the recipes use cornstarch, flax seed or tapioca flour instead of egg sub/replacer. I've used tapioca flour instead of egg replacer in some of my old, favorite recipes with good results.<br />Very Happy with this purchase.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Can't get it to work and can't get money back.  May be me but that is where I am at moment.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have had zinio for a few years<br />I also have the Barnes and Noble reader<br />But in todays world of PC, laptop, Smart phone and tablets, the Kindle reader gives the best flexibility of reading on the reader I choose when I want.
B00AE2J1PE|4.0|Really good movie. A glimpse into how things were during this time in history. Very well done. Would recommend watching. I even bought this movie through amazon for my kindle and amazon instant video to watch on TV.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|I love many of these songs. Sometimes more than the originals (blasphemy, I know). One of only a few CDs with vocalists than I can listen to all the way through.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was very reluctant to read this series but one boring Saturday gave in and started reading the first book.  About 10 pages in I could not put it down and by the end of the weekend I had purchased and read the last two books.  If your on the fence about this series give it a try and you will be pleasantly entertained throughout the series.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I really enjoy the PianoGuys music and I think this is a good compilation of their work. I would recommend this CD to others who like interesting but still chill music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Quite simply put, this schow is amazing.  It has all the drama and intresting group dynamics you would expect from an AMC show.  very much on par with Mad Men and Breaking Bad.  if your scared to put your toe in the water when it comes to being a zombie junkie, this is a great place to start!
B003UESJH4|5.0|I love this movie. I find it inspiring and I am blown away by Collin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, and Geoffrey Rush. They did a phenomenal job.
B002361MLA|1.0|A colleague begged me to buy this book and give it a go :-/<br /><br />I did, and I regretted it.<br /><br />Basically, if you are unhappy, look deep within yourself and find what it is that makes you happy. It is easy and it is in there somewhere, apparently!<br /><br />There you go, I have just saved you 8 dollars. Something else to be happy about :)<br /><br />Ciao for now
B008458O3S|4.0|I can get hooked on this game if I am not careful and just keep playing and playing for over an hour (that's a lot of time for me to play an app game)
B006YXTRHY|1.0|The cardboard male and female are back...and still can't act. The only thing interesting are the werewolves...and the non-leading vampires.

B009VB9VKY|1.0|Absolutely stupid.  Why didn't they just have the guys pose all thru it?  That's all it was.  Absolutely no plot whatsoever.  Dumb, dumb, dumb....
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Gripping book full of intrigue sucks you in and keeps you there, story told in a series of personal narratives.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I don't care what anyone says about this series!  I LOVED it!  The character develop of Christian Gray is absolutely amazing.  If psychology and figuring people out is your thing, this book is for you.  What a great read!  I went through the series twice back and back in case I missed anything the first go around.  Many classified this as &#34;mommy porn&#34; but without the sexual nature of the character exposed, there is no way to develop the character like EL James did.<br />LOVE IT!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Some of the scenes become kinda boring,<br /> but besides that some crazy things happen to make up for it! Had me hooked from the beginning.
159514188X|5.0|I read this at the insistence of a student and was shocked by the book, but fascinated by the story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very addicting, the best one yet!<br />Although the author favors the same words, and repeats them, the story line is great.
0547884591|5.0|It's not just about cooking, but enough so that the title isn't misleading. Tons of useful information, and most of the recipes are \\"4-Hour Body Diet\\" compliant as well!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I just finished reading the book and enjoyed it. I have read all the prior books and enjoy the story telling and the tough characters. If you like Vince Flynn you will like this one also.<br />Mike
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow, I read this book in about a day.  I couldn't put it down.  Not only was the sex hot, hot, hot, but my emotions were all over the place. One second your happy, then pissed off, then really sad.  You learn more about Gideon's emotional baggage and your heart breaks for both of them at one point.  Yet you can't help but cheer Eva on!  I admire her strength and her real emotions.  I love that these characters seem so real.  I loved that it all came together yet left you wanting more.  I guess you know, I love this book!  I can't wait to read the 3rd in this trilogy.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I haven't finished this delightful book yet and know it's going to be one of those that I don't want to finish because it's so good.  It's timely, funny, well-written, and I look forward to all the surprises that I know will be coming.  I'd taken advantage of the free download and got totally hooked so I purchased it and can now read it on my iPhone.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really loved 50 Shades of Grey, but in this book the characters are more developed, deeper and a little darker.  I liked that Eva had her own emotional baggage(unlike Anna in 50 Shades) to deal with and loved her strong personality.  Her emotions were real.  What can you say about Gideon!  He's hot, sexy, smart and rich!  You can't wait to get to know him better.  His pull to Eva and come one were unbelievably funny and hot!<br /><br />This story is more developed and you also get more involved with the secondary characters that are just as flawed as Eva and Gideon which only enhances this story.  I couldn't recommend this book book.  I couldn't put it down.
1416575464|5.0|this book is full of beautiful examples of decorating that you can adapt to your own home. if you liked the magazine you will love the book. even the book cover itself is nicely done and looks great out on the coffee table for all to browse.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Engrossing and gross at the same time; they spare no expense on make-up or special effects; a simple and overdone high story, it's the bottom story that creates the intrigue. They've taken what George Romero did in the 1960's and polished it for an audience in 2012. It is 'wicked' good.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|this movie has a very mixed cast of very good actors. the story line was really good and each character had his own quirkieness and slightly abnormal behavior to make for an entertaining movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another exciting book by Vince-Great read, could hardly put it down! Cant wait for the next in the Mich Rapp series.
B0057567P0|3.0|It has worked well in some situations and worked HORRIBLY in others.  If the task you're performing can be completed while you babysit the process, then this adapter works like a champ.  Let me tell you, USB 3.0 is SOOOOOOOOOO much FASTER than USB 2.0 and Firewire for transferring files from your computer to an external drive!!<br /><br />However, if your task takes longer than a couple of hours, I do not recommend this device at all.  Every time I tried to do a full system backup, an overnight task (or at least 4-5 hrs), the entire system crashed or the card mysteriously stopped responding, etc.  As the length of the task grew so did its flake factor.<br /><br />The entire expresscard design (not just this card) seems very fragile!  I treat this card as if it were fine China.<br /><br />For longer tasks, I recommend just buying a firewire drive.  The firewire connection seems very solid (probably because it's integrated with the computer), and I never have an issue with overnight jobs.  While Firewire is slower than USB 3.0, it's not THAT much slower!  The difference in speed between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 is MUCH bigger than the difference between USB 3.0 and Firewire.
1610660242|5.0|good book  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. I read it and it was good.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Other than the obligatory terrible Will Smith rap at the end, I liked this movie a lot! Much like &#34;John Carter of Mars&#34;, I find it a little surprising that this movie did not do better in the theaters. I think it is better than MiB 2, and Josh Brolin does a great Tommy lee Jones. Also, Emma Thompson is a great choice as the new &#34;Zed&#34;. I can only assume that &#34;professional&#34; movie critics are paid stooges and that I am the only person you can trust to review a film, because MiB3 was a lot of fun!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|I purchased this for a friends little boy and it came and was huge!!!! He is going to love it. Came earlier than I thought it would. Very pleased
B002413TY2|3.0|First off, many reviewers were complaining that the girl wasn't hot enough. To you I say, buy some glasses. The girl is plenty hot, and that really doesn't matter much anyway. The biggest problem with this movie is that Frank could have killed the skinny, weedy, pointless mastermind five or six times without blowing himself up, and I really wanted him to because that dude was super annoying. However, plot and story have never been the strong suit of movies like this. Explosions, fight scenes, and a touch of goofiness are, however, and this movie had plenty of those, plus they had the inspector, who I like a lot. At their best (or after you've had a few drinks) these movies are like ultra-violent Jerry Lewis films, which kind of makes sense, really, and this one falls into the &#34;had a few drinks&#34; category. Still pretty fun though!
B0081JPTCQ|2.0|Way too complicated to use easily for me. I had hopes for it. I'll uninstall it and try something else.
0547884591|4.0|\\"tangential jumping\\", \\"manic\\" - These are part of the style of a brainiac who seems to have a touch of ADHD. Tim Ferriss is among the few who manage to tame at least SOME of it. Always an interesting read for the flexible type.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Beautiful and durable.  The color is great. It is flexiable and convenient.<br />I don't like your review process  I write what I like and not what you tell me is mandatory in order for my review to count.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughters, ages 8, 6, and 3, LOVE this game. It's a great motivator around our house (i.e. &#34;After you clean your room you can play Temple Run!&#34; or &#34;If you don't stop messing with your sister you're going to be banned from playing Temple Run for a week.&#34;)
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Rented this one on Thanksgiving while the family was visiting.  Great movie for the whole family.  Would highly recommend it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I wish I had started using this sooner.  I love that I can access the information from my phone, computer, and Kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I love the series, but the video quality was fuzzy some times and it stopped and started many times while I was watching.
B003MXB4FC|5.0|It's so dumb and weird that it's funny.  Great one-liners to remember forever.  Now my girls are watching it and quoting it!
B008FPZQRO|5.0|The sound is pristine and clear. The out takes makes for some interesting and fascinating listening. Very nice for ELP fans or anyone who likes history.
B00633W614|5.0|True to his calling, Archer's writing has the reader on the edge of the chair until the end and  waiting for the third of the trilogy.
B00913DPW2|4.0|This game is very difficult, but if you like puzzles you will like this one.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of that would make this type of game easier would be a way to keep notes in the game.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man is a book that is hard to put down.  If you like Flynn or Patterson this is a must read. It is spell binding from the get go to the finish.
B004SRNH10|5.0|I would recommend Adobe products as I find them to be most useful and do the things I need to do.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was level 78, just about had the whole board cleared, update went through, could not finish missions without getting kicked out the game. Uninstalled,  then reinstalled and now I have to start all over again. Forget that, I'm done with this game. Whatever you do, do not uninstall on your kindle.......you lose everything. :(
0307730697|5.0|A friend of mine told me to read this book so I bought it yesterday.  I started reading, thinking I would get through a couple of chapters, late last night.  I was so captivated by Adam Brown's story I couldn't put it down.  This is a man who's life challenges all of us in our actions and thinking.  After reading this book I am challenged to be a better husband, father, son, pastor, and man.<br /><br />Adam's life and transformation from drug addict to world's best show the power of God and the will to overcome.  It is clear that the author himself was transformed by his interactions with those who knew Adam and he has done a masterful job of communicating that message throughout the pages of Fearless.  You won't regret reading this and you won't be able to stop until you've read the last page with the best question of them all.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is easily one of the best series i've seen on TV.  Great show, watch it and quit reading reviews!
B000001FZK|4.0|On what was to become Talk Talk's last collective studio album, songwriters Mark Hollis and Tim Friese-Greene continue along the path they began following on 'Spirit of Eden'. Like two bedouins riding their camels into the sunset together, the material on this LP is (more or less) a continuation of the murky, obscure stuff presented on the previous album. After listening to this LP, there is little doubt in my mind that Hollis and Friese-Greene were obviously into SOMETHING together - but the question is, what WAS that something, exactly, and why did they choose to continue on the path of the wandering nomad when they could have done something different altogether?<br />  Don't get me wrong - this material has its place and all of that. I mean, it's interesting - but to me it doesn't adequately represent the Talk Talk I have come to know and understand. I feel that this project, in particular, opens up more questions than answers... and points to a work, comprehensively speaking, that somehow was left uncompleted.<br />  Bassist Paul Webb is mysteriously absent from the credits on this album. Speculation as to why this may be, however, I feel would not be useful to hash up now. His absence might not bother me so much if it weren't for the fact that he will always be considered one of the Core Three (the other two being Hollis and Harris). Friese-Greene is sometimes regarded as having been the group's unofficial fourth member; and, if looking at it from a songwriting/ producing point of view, this may be appropriate to some. But Friese-Greene early on got into the producing end of things (rather like heard but not seen), whereas Webb did the touring, the promotional work, the backup vocals (at least until SOE), and contributed to the songwriting (during the band's early days) as well. So to me the Core Three will always be held firmly together, both by memory and through the work that they did while the group was still around. 'Essential' Talk Talk has to include all three of them.<br />  This last project reminds me of a canvas unfinished; it's as though they were working on this 'portrait of ideas' but then left some parts of it blank. Would it be so out of line for me to suggest at this point, that maybe one day these TT members can settle their creative differences and put together a conclusive, tie-it-all-together type of thing? I'm aware that they ran into some legal snags, supposedly right around the time this LP was released... and I don't mean to sound indifferent or unsympathetic when I say this (because no matter what happened, I am on their side - right or wrong), but I am not coming from that angle. I've always been partial to a good mystery - and if TT's last (collective) effort (and their subsequent breakup) isn't one of them, well then I just don't know what is.<br />  Exploring this material got me thinking about something I haven't thought about in quite some time: trying to complete a Rubik's cube. Back in the day (which for me will always be the 1980's), Rubik's cubes were hugely popular, and just about everybody had one. I would twist and turn that puzzle of a block for hours at a stretch, but not once was I able to get all the sides to display solid colors with the movable squares. I tried the mini-version ones, too (the ones that came out later, that could be attached to keychains) - but still the end result was the same. I just never got it quite right, try as I may (and I did) to complete the puzzle, and get the cube to look the way it did in the beginning.<br />  This is sort of what Talk Talk's legacy has become to me now - a puzzle where the pieces are scattered all over the place, and need to be set right again.<br />  In a musical composition, 'coda' is a term that indicates a change to the ending of a piece. This is much of the reason why I chose this word to be the title for this review - because this is what I feel still can, and should, happen somewhere down the road. I still believe this groupcan collectively come together, take their places around the table ('collectively' meaning that early contributors, like Simon Brenner, would be offered to have a part in this as well), throw their ideas into the proverbial hat and create a more suitable ending. Yes there would be kinks to be ironed out, pointed discussions to be had, and (more than likely) legal matters to contend with. Yes it would take time, be a lot of work, require a lot of effort and patience from everybody involved. But, at the end of the day - when that final NEW song has been recorded and added to the disc; when this new thing finally comes out, and loyal listeners (along with who knows how many new ones) rush out to give it a first listen; when all of the scattered pieces are in place, and at last there is an answer, a closure, a tying up of all the loose ends...<br />  Food for thought, to be sure.<br />  And while no one can be certain of the ending to this ongoing mystery, I feel that a NEW album would be akin to the way that bygone seafarers felt upon stumbling across buried treasure in their travels, and popping the lock open for the first time. It would be like the way that a reader, engrossed in a good mystery novel, feels when s/he finally figures out the 'whodunnit' part of the story. It would be like the way a scientist feels upon discovering a breakthrough cure to some persistent human ailment. It would be like the way a Rubik's cube user feels when all of the squares are lined up correctly, and all the sides display solid colors.<br />  So, what's the ending to THIS story?<br />  THAT I am still waiting to find out.can collectively come together, take their places around the table ('collectively' meaning that early contributors, like Simon Brenner, would be offered to have a part in this as well), throw their ideas into the proverbial hat and create a more suitable ending.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Ok, some may say it is a &#34;chick book&#34;. Dont care! I loved every moment I was reading it. Introspective, it will take you from humor to tragety. The only thing I regretted about reading it was that it ended.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Well, fortunately I still have my iPhone so I could read this book.  It's not half bad, and it left me wondering who the Rick Riordan person is.  How does he know about all of my adventures???
B006VGGAC4|5.0|The book is very interesting and very well written. Grass did not grow under this guys feet so it is always on to the next thing. The most interesting part is the book is an amazing read but I am not sure that I would be friends with him. He comes across as a bull in a china shop a lot of the time. Some of that might be the directness of the language as this is still his second language.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I fall asleep with this every night . It calms me down after a stressfull day. I just lie down and fall asleep. I love all of the chooses even though the humming is a bit creepy. They have so many creative sounds including butterfly. It is also great for medatation. You just sit down or lie down and your mind goes into a peaceful state. A must buy for every body.

B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the, &#34;Step Up,&#34; franchise, so I was definitely looking forward to seeing its latest installment.  &#34;Step Up: Revolution,&#34; completely exceeded my expections because the dancing is absolutely incredible.  Each dance scene had me mesmorized and there were moments where I couldn't help but exclaim things like, &#34;Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&#34; or &#34;Daaaaaaaaaaaaang!&#34;  I know a movie is good when I have no control over how I respond to its amazingness.  Furthermore, the storyline wasn't terrible either.  There are some dance movies with horrible plots, and it's obvious they're hoping the dance sequences will compensate for the lack of storyline.  &#34;Step Up: Revoluation,&#34; didn't fall into that category for me.  The dancers are ultimately fighting for something important and I found myself cheering them and their cause on.  If you are a dance enthusiast of any kind, I highly recommend this movie.  I guarantee that you won't be bored!
B000YHG72E|5.0|I love watching this movie every holiday season. The humor is family friendly, but also hilarious for adults (similar to the pixar movies). The story of Buddy the Elf, a human who grew up at the North Pole, is both hilarious and heart warming at the same time. I highly recommend this movie, it is chock full of one-liners and Will Ferrell is at his best in this one.
0061766089|4.0|it was a required text from UCI where i went for a 4month MBA exchange.<br />we were asked to read it in order to grasp the concept of 'design thinking'.<br />i really liked the book. simply written, engaging and nicely structured. you really want to know more, more and more as you go through the pages.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|And this one did not disappoint. It is staying true to the Nikki Heat series and a good beach/spa read.

B009329ZF2|4.0|This was a good renter and I will proably get it if I see its on sale for 10 bucks, I am glad I did not see this in the theaters however, but as I said this movie was a good renter and it was a LOT better then I was expecting.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Always watch this around the holidays but it is great any time of the year! Highly recommended to anyone !
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie was a big let down that for the most part I was WTF am I watching??? DO your self a favior save your money.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This Emma is more in line with the Jane Austen novel for its precociousness and in giving time for the development of the characters.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Well written.  In spite of my promise to myself that I would avoid WWII themes (too many currently), i couldn't put this one down.  Not the very best literature - but a good read.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|This movie had great hype and I really looked forward to it as the &#34;beginning&#34; of the Alien series, but it was a major dissappointment.  Sort of a combination of &#34;Contact&#34; with &#34;Event Horizon&#34;, but without the development of the characters.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was selected to be read by a book club member.  If not for that I would not bought it. I just couldn't get into the book, it was confusing going back & forth from past and present. I couldn't even finish reading the book,I just had my friends tell me what happened & how it ended. They admitted to skipping parts of the books and not being impressed with the book either.
B004SIP9W4|4.0|I enjoy a quiet and comical movie now and then.  The movie is about people assuming situations incorrectly at a slow pace, something to enjoy while relaxing.
B009IF82SK|5.0|This is truly one of the funniest shows on TV. I love each character and their distinct personalities. Sheldon is the best!!!!
B00908DDZM|4.0|I am a little disappointed by this album, but more from a production standpoint than anything else.  Although the content and style exemplifies Macklemore's creativity and message, the beats take a little bit from it.  The production is solely handled by Ryan Lewis, who delivers nicely, well-varied, orchestrated beats...unfortunately with a rather amateur feel.  Some of the sounds on the productions sounds raw and like something you'd find from FL Studio.  Macklemore performs nicely, with nice direction and messages sprinkled through, over his abstract flow and unique delivery.  Some tracks try to have a more uptempo feel but just don't come together well.  Nice album and nice message, just the beats kind of take away from it.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds keeps me guessing and sitting on the edge of my seat. The &#34;Unsub&#34; is not easily guessed by the viewer and is always so very strange. Love Penelope and her wild sense of style.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Addicting, you can't watch just one.  I liked this better than the series 24, it was more realistic.  The main charachter is very interesting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator.This was free. The app is easy to use and does eveything I hoped it would. Thank you!
0783225482|5.0|Love this movie, I never get tired of watching it. It's a great movie to watch with my grandkids, they love it too.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Love this album!  If you love the sounds of the piano and cello, but would like an upbeat and contemporary take on movies and pop music, these guys are for you!  If you are not sure if you should buy, go to their youtube.com chanel and check them out, their music videos are part of the experience and spectacular!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I like the free Alarm Clock,and now that I corrected my time I find it a great new tool.  No matter where I am, if I have my Kindle, I have an alarm clock.  What is better than that.  Oh, and it was free.  Thanks Amazon.
B009SQR28A|5.0|Fell in love with this movie the first time i watched it. The humor, the story, the scenery, all spark the imagination and bring back the kid in us. And inspire a whole new generation of Santa fans.....
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Perch of Kairos does not show up at level 16 on this aneroid version. Love the addictive game except for the bugs. Force close occurs often.
0547884591|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has thrown their hands up in defeat and thought the words \\"I'm obviously just not good at....\\" An in depth and interesting look at what aspects of any skill will give the greatest return, in the shortest time.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Readable but very light and fluffy - the plot takes off in a direction that makes little sense - not one of his finer efforts.
0062183591|5.0|I read Dan Ariely's book \\"The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty\\" in my course Forensic Research and Analysis for Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics. You can check out the homepage of the program by following this link. [...]<br />I found so many new insights on cheating and dishonest acts after reading this book. I liked his Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC), we seek our own advantages and thats how we proceed through life. The fudge factor was also interesting to me because the goal cheaters have is to be able to look at themselves and still feel good about themselves while also benefiting from cheating.  Also the idea that once people cheat and get away with it they think why not I'll just cheat more because I've already done it once. Lastly, Ariely's explanation of why people steal material aspects instead of money like a coke. Its amazing how people can rationalize in their heads about why its ok to steal.<br />I found no weaknesses in the book. It kept me interested, gave me many new insights, and kept me laughing. I never looked at cheating, and why people cheat the way he describes. I have an entirely different outlook thanks to Dan Ariely.<br />As I start my career in fraud and forensics I will take a lot from this book, and apply it to my job. I now understand the mind of cheaters, and why they do it. I can apply those ideas to better investigate dishonest behavior which will keep me ahead of the game in my career.<br /><br />Definitely a great book to read! You won't regret it!
B005LAIHQS|3.0|The only thing redeemable about this issue was Josh Brolin. There are some scenes that are interesting, like the exterior of the bunker for JFK on the beach. If you want to rent this one first, do so.
1416594795|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Dawkins last book, The God Delusion, which helped me re-evaluate my belief system (not to mention a complete re-examination of what the basis of morality is). Now, with The Greatest Show on Earth, we get a remarkably glorious look at the many wild inventions of mother nature, which really should make us marvel as beings who, if not for our larger brains, would be a thoroughly average member of the animal kingdom. It's only our ability to appreciate the wonder around us that makes us so interesting. Dawkins brings a lot of credibility to the &#34;theory&#34; (using that in the ironic, religiously-skeptical sense) of evolution, while also managing to take some thoroughly enjoyable pot-shots at creationists. However, the tone of this book is quite different from &#34;Delusion&#34;, and it's easy to tell Dawkins wanted to keep the focus on demonstrating why evolution is a scientific theory, and not just conjecture or a hypothesis like creationists like to claim. It's certifiably true.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|A good movie for any fan of DC characters. The best thing, is Nightwing finally gets some some movie love
B007T99ENE|3.0|Difficult to believe the writer was a woman. Found the responses he described to feel as if from a male. Very involved political issues.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The virtual world Cline creates is not too many steps beyond what many of us imagine now when we watch kids playing video games.  We seem to be heading for some kind of a future with virtual worlds more and more real and threatening to supplant good old reality.  This novel is well written, suspenseful and the characters are drawn with sufficient dimension to make you care about them.  This will appeal to young and older readers, anyone really who appreciates sci fi, dystopias and a good story.  The mysterious Steve Jobs character who has died and offered up his empire to the most accomplished gamer has an obsession with the culture of the 70's and 80's.  This makes it fun for those of us who grew up playing cutting edge games like Asteroids and who remember Pong.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Great app! I need white noise to fall asleep but my boyfriend hates the fan... this is a great compromise!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is awesome. Very gory though but it fits the story line. I recommended it to my mom who is 70 and she loves it too. Wish I didn't have to wait until February for the next episode!
B0091LS07E|1.0|She got rich and the made this garbage that she should be totally ashamed of making. Getto,rap, nonsense, trash and sorry crap.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|I like the work of the author who wrote the book on which this movie was based, and have read the book.  In my opinion, movies are rarely as good as the books, but this one was very good. I watched it using the Amazon application, which is excellent.
B000IKQMFO|1.0|hard to follow-not nearly as good as Downton Abbey.<br />Would not reccommend  to anyone even my enemies<br />slow down the dialog next time
0061474355|5.0|I bought Sibreal when I was about 12/13 from my middle schools book fair. I was perplexed and in mystified as to why I even bought it in the first place due to the sheer volume of book. But being a chubby pre-teen who was I to argue, I would begin to seek refuge in the Old Kingdom. The exploration of a strong female character that dove in to the unknown where Charter marks wove magic, the ability to govern the dead lived so vividly, and the sweet sound of bells singing could decide fate. I was in awe. I would urn for the companionship of Magget and more so later the Disreputable Dog. These characters that were alive on the paper would creep into my thoughts, making me feel connected to them I would live through them in their adventures. I would feel joy when Sibreal defeated Kerrigor, cry later when Lireal didn't receive the sight, Garth Nixs novel would eventually turn me into the person I am today a slightly less chubby 22 year old.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is a good example of the classic point and click puzzle games of the past. I had a lot of fun playing the game and was reminded of playing the game Myst years ago.<br /><br />A must play if you love puzzle games
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I enjoy this game - - levels vary from easy to pretty difficult so it keeps your interest - - my daughter tried it and she is hooked now,  I do wish there were more levels though.
B0086700CM|4.0|love this game, but the lagging needs to be fixed. after getting so far, it skips and I die. please fix.
B002BBJ52U|3.0|This is one of those stories that just isn't all that memorable.  It's the same old same old, as far as the plot goes.  Not bad, but not great, either.
B00136Q6DA|3.0|Download was excellent. Just what I expected. I heard this artist once on pandora and wanted to experience her music for myself. One thing is that I wished I had known about some of the profane lyrics in some of the songs before I downloaded, since there is no warning of lyrics on the label or in the description.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I don't do reviews often but I would highly recommend this book.  Anyone who starts it will have a hard time putting it down. It's one of the best I have read this year.
B005LAIHHC|1.0|What's new?  This guy Cohen, unlike most entertainers in Hollywood, gets to make fun of any and every group out there!  He uses the African nation of Eritrea for his fake \\"Wadyia\\" country which they call \\"North Africa\\" when it is in East Africa.  If it was supposed to be a joke - it was not funny.  From there, they go into every arab stereotype and does everything to vilify them.  The dictator seems based on Moamar Qaddafi and is more of Cohen's insults to groups other than his own.  He calls blacks \\"sub-Saharans\\" but his fictional nations is located there!  I know by calling blacks 'sub-Saharans,\\" that is more of a political thing.  He calls an African from Sudan \\"blackie\\" and \\"sub-Saharan\\" when Sudan is IN the Sahara! It's no wonder this film flopped.  He also has the styalized arabs types in the film with afros and looking mixed.  I can imagine what point a guy like Cohen is trying to get across, but I won't say it here.  Just do one of those daily shows if insults and political propaganda is your main focus, because comedy certainly is not!  We know there is only one reason he stays employed.  This guy Cohen is a straight out racist.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Some parts of the book were impossible to understand what the characters were saying since the writer felt compelled to use historical phrasing and vernacular.  The disconnected nature of the narrative was hard to follow and the vague connections over time (comet like birthmark) were vague and meaningless.  I guess the message was that the more things change (time shifts) the more they stay the same (strong overpower the weak).  Another book that I couldn't wait to finish and move on.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I chose this rating because even though it has a serious plot it also had some dead spaces that could have been given more excitement or humorous scenes.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Famous authors sometimes run out of ideas or inspiration and drop down to elementary pandering on their name and reputation with weak formula based stories just to cash in on a few more dollars.  This book is one of those.  I would be leery of  buying the next John Grisham book if this is his new standard.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Yes, the 3rd CD is basically \\"extras\\", different versions of songs already on the first 2, etc, but seriously, $16 for the first 2 CD's would be a great deal.  Think of the 3rd disk as a bonus.  There are 34 songs between the first 2 disks, that's a lot of Queen hits, and it pretty much covers all their stuff.  A great box set.  If you're a Queen fan, but not enough of a Queen fan to buy all their single albums, this set is all you'll need.  Highly recommended.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This book is tedious, clever and really just silly.  Reading it is like watching someone put together a jigsaw puzzle one piece at a time.  Events are fabricated to fit together all too nicely with outsized historical events.  I couldn't wait to finish it so I could put it down and move on.
B0016JBCJW|3.0|I have seen Owen Wilson do better --- could not say much for the story. And Bill Murray...wow talk about a cameo role. Not sure it qualified as that even. Not worth the money
B008Y77GNA|3.0|Not a bad movie but nothing the first. Direction is bad. Special effects only ok, and the story lacks depth
B00338QENI|5.0|Very compelling story of exploitation of human dignity for medical science research by respected institutions without the consent of the patient.
B004PA50JM|5.0|I love this album.  It has REM in majestic rocking form with the best collection of songs since before they lost their drummer and got a bit tedious with the ditties and filler songs in the 90s.<br /><br />Why they would retire is beyond me.  They still have it here and then some.  The mixes are better than ever and the songs resonate loud and energetic and the lyrics don't fall into that overly precious category Stipes got into for awhile.<br /><br />They are a seminal rock band who destroyed the world in the 80s and great songs are great songs from great groups and top to bottom there are great songs on this one.<br /><br />Rediscover! them.
0307949508|5.0|This is one of a trilogy by a very clever and compelling author.  Read the review for the other book I reviewed.  This is an even partner for that one.
B008ZTVQLA|5.0|I usually review Bat for Lashes and BJM and such, but a great songwriter is a great songwriter is a great song writer.  Ian Hunter has cranked out an incredible collection of guitar and piano rock and roll with his gravely Dylanesque voice that doesn't have a weak track on it.  Even the odd tribute to the Indian dude was great.  Ian Hunter is in the same category as Ray Davies and Bob Dylan and John Hiatt.  Just friggin great song writers who can't stop producing great songs year in and year out.<br /><br />Ian Hunter belongs in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but then again, that's a joke and a stupid fraternity, but geez.  This album is amazing, whether it was produced by a guy in his twenties or a guy in his seventies.  Ageless, timeless killer rock and roll.
0307454568|5.0|The author of the three books is a spell weaver and every one of his books is an excellent read.<br />The heroine is one of the most unusual you will come across: tough, ruthless and tragic and totally worth meeting.

0062059882|5.0|I finally got around to reading the original version of this about 10 years after it was released.  I'm kicking myself for not reading it earlier.  I was so thoroughly taken with the story and characters that I picked up the 10th anniversary edition hoping for more more more.  I have to say that I can't find a whole lot different, but maybe I just haven't reached the new parts yet.<br /><br />I identified very much with Shadow, since we are both a bit on the quiet side.  Some might think the character wooden because of his reserved or subdued reactions to things that would leave others screaming, but the things he does say tend to reverberate with feeling.  It's pretty amazing to read between the lines and get a feel for the great depth there.<br /><br />The story got its hooks in me early on and never let go until the end.  I loved the inclusion of all the different mythological figures, and the glimpses they provide at how beings of that nature might get through, day by day, in the modern world.  Simply engrossing.<br /><br />This book is slowly turning into my default Christmas and birthday gift for folks.  I should probably make a list so I don't give it to the same person twice.
0375836675|4.0|I read the first couple of pages online and was instantly hooked.  I ordered it  and immediately couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the concept of the book, and it was fast-paced and interesting.  The one thing I found to complain about was the ending - it just didn't provide the satisfaction I was looking for, and in a small way I thought it was a cop-out. I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, and maybe you will feel differently than me anyway.  Overall, I would still recommend the book and Markus Zusak as an author.
B007NVJ7NU|1.0|Honestly, I couldn't watch this.  The Buddhist theme is what attracted me, but the raw, home-movie type video along with a muffled sound track that made hearing the dialog difficult was a huge turn off.  In addition, during the 20 minutes or so that I suffered through, there was nothing there in terms of plot or character.
0307592731|3.0|This story had an interesting premise, and it was told by a talented writer, so that was an excellent starting point. The reason I'm only giving it three stars is because the author/narrator was just not someone I would probably get along with in real life.<br /><br />For starters, her mother's death was a huge part of this story. Her mother died when Cheryl was 22, and that was a large part of what motivated her to go \\"find herself\\" on the Pacific Crest Trail. That a tragedy could inspire to do something so brave and adventurous and strengthening is great. Unfortunately, she also seemed to be using her mother's death as an excuse. She used it as an excuse for not finishing school, for cheating on her husband, for being drawn towards drugs. I lost my mother when I was 19, so I know first-hand that a mother's death is an excuse that almost anyone will accept as legitimate - but it's not. An excuse is only an excuse if you make it one, and she seemed desperate to identify a reason to escape responsibility for her shortcomings.<br /><br />On the trail, Cheryl did become mentally stronger. She had to focus on what was important, to get thrifty and creative, keep herself safe and figure out how far to push her boundaries. She told about some of her previous experiences, with drugs and casual sex, and came to the conclusion that she didn't regret any of it because it made her who she was today. I can buy that to an extent, but only to an extent. She made dumb, selfish, careless decisions that could have hurt other people, and sometimes did hurt other people. I didn't need or want to see her absolutely beat herself up over her past, but she seemed to feel so little remorse that it turned me off a bit.<br /><br />On the other hand, her actually stories of hiking the trail, of how she survived with very little money, interacted with questionable strangers, defended herself against frogs and bears and rattlesnakes, kept herself entertained, learned how to use an ice axe ... that stuff was very interesting to read.
1439153663|4.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\" spans nearly two decades and is told from two viewpoints: Lavinia McCarten, an Irish immigrant orphaned by disease, and Belle Pyke, a young biracial slave who lives and works in the kitchen house on a tobacco plantation in Virginia.  Both women endure hardship and loss, their pain often shared but at times all their own; Lavinia copes with the loss of her family in her formative years (she comes to Tall Oaks plantation at the tender age of six), a highly dysfunctional marriage later; Belle struggles with her role as a domestic servant and her connection to the plantation's owner who continually promises her emancipation.<br /><br />There are several incredibly touching and selfless acts in the book.  When one woman finds herself incapacitated by grief after the death of her daughter, another steps in to care for her newborn baby, even going so far as offering comfort by participating in the mother's delusion of her long dead sister.  Two women love the same man, yet due to insurmountable circumstances overcome their jealousies and form a surprising camaraderie.  Orphaned children find surrogate mothers in nearly every woman in the kitchen house, with one mother allowing one of her children to be \\"adopted\\" by another after her own child is lost to her.  Though men populate Grissom's story, I feel that \\"The Kitchen House\\" is really a novel about women for women, the story a discourse on the bonds that form between them during the most trying of times.<br /><br />The story takes place during a time when women had little rights and men could abuse them with ease and entitlement (wives and female slaves alike) so even if you have only slightly feminist views don't be surprised to feel a little outrage when reading certain passages.  There was also primitive knowledge of medicine in the late 18th and 19th centuries so expect more than a few deaths.<br /><br />This is a spectacular debut for Kathleen Grissom.  I am highly anticipating her next work.
0142410322|3.0|The book is fine. It was for a child and luckily not a christmas present, because the packaging wasn't very good. It came bent, almost in half. Luckily the kids didn't mind at all.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book!! Just finished book 2, ready for the new one to come out later in May!! I'm hooked!
B007HACDLK|4.0|As usual Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp makes for a great story.  My one issue was the cursing (one word in particular) throughout the book.  I expected some bad language, but not this much.  I did not feel that it added to the story.<br /><br />Having said that, the story was true Mitch Rapp and I enjoyed the book and I enjoy Vince Flynn as a writer.
B00062J00S|5.0|This movie is a classic for a reason.  It's got a great story and I just love everything about it.
0062213423|5.0|My grandaughter wants this in a big way from Santa...she must love it, if she loves it, I love giving it to her.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season but darker (if possible) than the previous seasons. Not much to say without ruining parts. I liked it a bit more when it was more humans verse zombies rather than human verse human. However,the writers do a great job a showing the natural progression of what could happen so I will leave the writing to them.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Five star all the way!!  Grandkids want this for Chhristmas gift from Santa...and I want to give them what they want...Thank you Santa and Amazon
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|It leaves it open at the end to a possible second movie.<br /><br />Really enjoyed the move would recommond it to others

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Nice break from the usual. Good graphics and playable within a reasonable amount of time. Does use battery quicker though. Nicely thought out UI and looks great on Galaxy Note2
B000EWBKM6|5.0|This again gets a five star rating because my grandaughter and her university friends love this...it is on her Christmas list of favorites so she will be excited...and so will her friends...
B009LRE040|4.0|The film is definitely worth watching, however, if you expect to see a lot of Batman action then you will be disappointed as the majority of the film has Bruce Wayne on screen instead. The sections when he is as Batman are great, the fight sequences are good with the only real let down being the \\"healing process\\" which I'm sure not one doctor in the world would approve of (except maybe Dr Nick from Simpsons).<br /><br />Bane was a great opposition for Batman and the story twist is partially unexpected and keeps the film going well.<br /><br />The ending of this film does set up the next film quite well which I have to say I am already looking forward to.
B007XHWROK|5.0|The younger teen set loves this fellow...BELIEVE was on grandaughter's Christmas list so I know she loves it...that means I love it and love that Amazon made it so easy to shop for...
B000YHE4AG|4.0|I tend to like Will Ferrel's movies even though they go over the top at times and while this movie does that too at times, it just isn't as funny as some of his other films. However, as a Christmas movie it is actually a pretty good one that I could imagine watching around Christmas time.<br /><br />Humour mixed with a feel good ending make it open to most of the family unlike some of Will's other films which you wouldn't want your kids to see.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Won't my grandaughter be suprised to get this under the Christmas tree...she loves it...if she loves it, then Ilove giving to her..

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I liked that there were a number of versions that can be downloaded and some will actually read to you.  A nice way to get my reading in while I'm doing mindless housework.  It is a great download.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This gets a five star...my grandaughter loves this shop...requested it for Christmas...if she loves it...I love giving it to her...
B0012GVKVY|5.0|I don't often buy movies unless they are something that I will watch more than one time.  This movie is one that I can watch more than one time and still be entertained.  I like Sci-Fi, but it has to be something that has enough of a connection with reality that I can imagine it happening.  Yes, I can imagine this being real.
1401937519|5.0|Wow! Just WOW!<br /><br />Best book I've ever read on the subject of NDE's.<br /><br />Not preachy at all. As a matter of fact the only rule that Anita espouses is to be wary of rules.<br /><br />I've long dreaded death. It has literally ruled my life for most of my life. Tick, tick, tick...time is fleeting by and I'm not getting any younger.<br /><br />You don't have to live like a monk or attend Sunday service every week. You don't have to do anything but just BE WHO YOU ARE!<br /><br />Great book that I will read again...soon!
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|A good movie for action junkies.  It was fun to see all the action stars in one movie reviving their old movie tag lines.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|Great book, read them all. Starts slow, picks up fast! Order others ahead....Best read of the last year or so. Read book before you see the movie! Movie did a very good job of following the book, mostly. The movie is long, the book is much longer, both are worthwhile!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show so much! I started with the first season on netflix, and fell completely in love &#60;3 I suppose you could say I'm sort of addicted X3 .... I can't wait to see more.
0547884591|5.0|Obviously this isn't a book that you sit down and read but I've already picked up several cool tricks.  A couple that I've put into practice with great results.  Can't wait to execute a few more and see where they lead me.  I'll continue to jump around and choose the interesting reads.  I'm also working on my own version of a Food Marathon here in the Orlando area.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive. Keeps my mind sharp. It is very fun to play. My sister downloaded it also. I thanked my co-worker for sharing this with me.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|It never fails but I always have connection issues with Amazon!! I would recommend the movie, but would advise anyone to watch it on another site!! I have had several issues in the past with connectivity on Amazon. Don't waste your time! Look elsewhere!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|it will load up for a sec. then black out and go to the home screen when i really wanted to play
B002VHI8J0|4.0|I am still thinking about this oak and discussing it. The author has mastered the complex array of characters with perfectly conveyed voices, and has even shown a new flair for slapstick.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I needed a simple file manager quickly when File Expert died.  ES File Explorer fit the bill.  It allows me to browse, move and do all the other things a file manager should do.  I like the options once I found them.  It works well off line, something I have learned to watch for with some Android apps.  I have no idea how they make money because it was free but no advertisements have appeared.  Interface is clean and well organized.  If you are used to how Kindle Fire-compatible software works this will fit right in.  I'm usually wary of free stuff but didn't have time to look far since I was leaving for a location with no web access.  It came through, got me out of a jam and I am grateful.<br /><br />Update several months later: I'm still very happy with this.  I occasionally use my Kindle Fire as a light productivity tool (Excel, Word, reading work pdf and word documents, etc.)  It would be much harder organizing it without ES File Explorer.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Rick Riordan, simply put, is an amazing author, he seamlessly blends a fictional story with historical facts and events. A great read for anyone of any age.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you have never seen a Miyazaki film, this is one you need to see. Miyazaki is a master storyteller! The story line is fantastic, the animation is perfect. This one ws the first of his films I ever saw, ad instantly became one of my all time favorite films of any genre. Do yourself a favor and get this one. It's not a \\"kids\\" film as most Disney films are as it has elements that are appealing to to us older viewers as well.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Very well written without heavy math yet one can get a deeper understanding of a weak force, broken symmetries, the background of the discovery. Easy reading, very knowledgable author makes all the difference. At last a new book related to latest in physics focused on the concept of Higgs field puts the &#34;God particle' in the proper perspective.

0316228532|1.0|This is one of the worst book I've ever read. Unfortunately, it was not interesting enough to be thought provoking. Overall, it seemed to up offer a series of cynical snapshots of small town life.  The main characters were a boring cast of petty, superficial, self-serving, and sociopathic individuals whose social interactions blended together to fuel an assortment of human tragedies. It is the last J K Rowling book aimed for adults that i will ever purchase. It left me wondering if Rowling created such a magical  fantasy world in the HP series as a therapeutic escape from the world of mere muggles  (humans) which she clearly views with a disgusted and nauseous eye within The Casual Vacancy. The book could have been somewhat of a success as a dark comedy if only it had had a trace of humor. In short, this novel was a waste of time and money, and a complete disappointment.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I used this in my HP 3005 printer and it worked like a charm.  Came quick and was as described.  My only concern was that I don't think it was in the original package, the ESD bag was open...Either way, it worked fine.

B00018D3RI|5.0|I have all 4 seasons on DVD, good quality .  although, there are some scenes which were cut, on  episodes \\"Discomania\\",  Nightmare and Quadrophinia....  Being a Big fan of David Soul and  Paul Michael Glaser...I just had to have these .  Sound and Clarity are real good.  Chase scenes are  good and ---  no one  has  better natural chemistry on screen than these two guys...<br /><br />Oh, and  they're  sexy as hell, to boot!!!  Refreshing to see gorgeous  men  NOT  covered in  ink and  piercings.  Loved the show as a  girl and I  Love it now.  It's much  Better than  todays junk of reality shows and idiot comedies.

B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Although the animation is beautiful and the soundtrack sounds wonderful, the plot is, well, thin.  The villain has no motivation to be the villain, like the villian in &#34;Much Ado About Nothing.&#34;
1594135851|5.0|It was a good buy I just wish it had said that is was large print. I still would have purchased it, it just would have been nice to know.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Was semi-surprised that our Kindle didn't come with a calculator app.  Found this one and downloaded it, serves it's purpose well!

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|After having read the first and second of the Game of Thrones books, I was excited to see that there was a series associated.  I bought the BRD and now me, my wife, my parents, and my in-laws are all hooked.  My dad has read the first two books as well and I am closing in on halfway through the third.  The first season follows the book very closely!  Probably not suitable for kids, but as a grown adult I'm not going to act like I don't expect (enjoy) some nudity in a cable TV series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I downloaded this book based upon the 2000 plus positive reviews and I was not disappointed. Excellent writing, character development, use of irony, symbolism, contrasts. This book is destined to be a classic that my grandkids will hopefully be reading in school one day. Hopefully that school won't be on Level 34!<br /><br />Do you like Sci-Fi? Get this book. Do you like reading? Get this book!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I bought this really without having heard too much about it.  My wife and I love it, we got my parents and her parents hooked as well.  Physically this product is what it is, just make sure you know that there are only six episodes in the first season.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great adventure with Mitch Rapp.  It flies out of the starting gate and never stops until the last page.  Can't wait for the next one!!
B003L77G38|4.0|First off, BRD and quality are great, no issue with physical product.  Season Three just seemed a bit... less appealing than the first two seasons.  Season Four we are watching with Prime streaming right now and I can say that we are enjoying Season 4 a bit more.  Maybe the plots are just seeming to repeat at this point?
B004TN7QPG|1.0|The app would not load om my Android Tablet. Amazon stated that is most likely not compatible. I have downloaded apps for androids and no problems.
0345529057|5.0|I bought these books on some sort of deal about a year ago.  I have read the first 2.5, my dad has read my copies of the first two and my brother started reading the first.  Haven't had any issues with quality or things falling apart.  I always throw them in my overnight/weekend bag and they take a fair amount of abuse.  It's not leatherbound, but it said paperback when you bought it, right?  Good books so far too!
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I wish apple doesnt have us to buy expensive product like these, they are good quality but we are paying a lot more, have apple devices is having to have a long wish list of adapters, especially on ipad
B008JGSM6G|3.0|95% of the puzzles solve way too easy.  Would be a good game for kids probably.  This one just doesn't quite hold my interest.
B006SAR0OK|5.0|what can i say about this movie go and buy this movie now you will not be disappointed a very good movie
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have played quite a bit of Angry Birds over the past year or so.  Not terribly thought provoking or anything, but enjoyable.  Better than 99.99% of the other games available on tablets and mobile devices.
B006RXSGLE|5.0|this i wil say this about this movie the plot, charaters, music fights are all good, you should buy this movie and kill bill 2 together to fully enjoy both movies, so buy this movie NOW!
B002JVWR54|5.0|Physically the product &#34;is what it is&#34;.  No issues with discs or packaging.  The quality of Dollhouse on BRD is some of the best vs. other TV series on BRD at least in my experience.  It just seems a bit cleaner than most.  The series has a great storyline/premise (I'm sure someone copied it from someone or other such knock against it), but we throughly enjoyed it!
B008N1LL42|5.0|in the name only does this movie has to do with the game. now with that out of the way, i enjoyed this movie the f/x,plot ,charaters allgood so go and buy this movie NOW.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I've played quite a bit of Angry Birds and Bad Piggies is far superior, in my opinion.  Both are fun games, but Bad Piggies is more interactive.
B004MPESSY|3.0|as remakes go this was terrible, the orginal is far better, the remake is so-so, the back ground music is better and that about the only good thing about the remake,
B008B1VYP0|5.0|This album is full of songs that are bith catchy and well written. Overall it is on par with their earlier albums.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|what a lovely movie, lots of laughs, one-liners/running gags, good music,better charaters, i wished i saw this at the theater, buy this movie NOW! and give as a present, you will NOT BE disappointed.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Downloaded the akinator genie product to my kindle based on a recommendation of a coworker. You think of a character, and the akinator is supposed to be able to guess that character based on your answers to a series of yes/no questions. The genie guesses correctly when it comes to popular disney characters, actors from movies, and popular book characters. However, if you pick a character from a not-so-popular book/movie/person, it may not guess the correct character. In fact, when my husband was purposefully picking obscure characters to trip the genie up, it worked. The app would suddenly pop-up an unexpected error box after asking some questions, and it would force the app closed. We tried to reopen and try again with the same character in mind and the same thing happened. So, bottom line - the app is cool and amazing when you are thinking of a popular character. Sometimes you will be surprised and astounded at how quickly it guesses your character with so few questions answered. But, if you're a skeptic like my husband, you will find a way to trip-up the genie and generate the unexpected error, which is very disappointing for initial believers like me. Like finding out that santa clause and the easter bunny are not real...what?
B009KHDT0C|5.0|this movie so funny, i could not stop laughing a worthy remake of dark shadows i approve of this movie, so go and buy this movie NOW!
B009FXIICK|5.0|Play that before on DS.  Glad it is available in Android platform now.<br /><br />It is a fun little game similar to Bejewels.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I love this movie so much, receive DVD so quick and was brand new no scratches or any thing at all
B00943SQCI|3.0|From direction and production to the story-line, itself, I believed sub par. The characters, themselves, even lacked certain character... However, having said that, you must understand I am a HUGE critic.. And, when I am to ascertain the idea of a movie, with the likes of Johnny Depp - who I believe to be one of the best, if not THE BEST, of any and all other actors(to say the least) - I expect that movie to be one, of two, things:  A Blockbuster,  or,  mine-blowing!!  So, it is QUITE POSSIBLE that I an being to harsh.... But, always keep in mind, no matter what else, a movie is always a &#34;Must See&#34; if it is starring JOHNNY DEPP!!!!
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferris is definitely my new favorite author. He's clear, concise, and delivers information in a way that's easily understood and absorbed. If you want to upgrade your entire existence, read this book.
B000XSEPYQ|5.0|If you like horror - or, you are a critic, such as myself - this is an ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!!!!  The only HORROR films, that rival  &#34;SAW I - VI&#34;, are  &#34;SEVEN&#34; and, of course, &#34;Silence Of The Lambs&#34;!!  The only thing scarier, or more intriguing, is - What you're of mind comes up with this????  Where horror film ratings are concerned, this is an EASY 10........
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I was kind of hoping that I would get some advice on being a good supervisor--i didn't. But I did get some laughs. I mean once you read a mothers prayer for her daughter,  you're going to have to put the book down and laugh until you get it out of your system. About 15 minutes. If nothing else the book was a great laugh
B008VVT51U|4.0|A delightful story-line filled with seniors, for the most part - single and couples, are ending a huge chapter in life and beginning another.. Where most, at their age, would be content with the idea of living out the rest of their days in the same place they've always been, they decide otherwise. Many different people - with even more different and sometimes contrasting, lives and lifestyles - leave everything they've ever known, for a whole new world, they know nothing about. But, who could resist the beautiful and exotic rest haven offered in the Marigold brochure?? Arriving at their new abode, only to find it run down and in need of major repairs, they realized that the motel was the only first, of many, newly acquired impositions. Forced to share their environment, their opposing characters clash with some, find solace in others and, in the end, find that they are not so entirely different from the others, as originally believed. Surprisingly, the biggest difference was from within! And, witnessing the young owner's struggle to achieve his dreams of not only success, but love, brings forth the vitality they hadn't had since their youth, further allowing them to dream, to believe, to fight, to love........  A MOVIE TO REMIND US:  There's never an 'ending' in life, only new chapters! And, no matter the age, their is always plenty of room for open-mindedness, acceptance and, most importantly, CHANGE!!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another winner from Flynn.  Altho, this one did not have the bite of most earlier ones, I enjoyed the book immensely.  I guess Rapp is just like Bond.  The books are always either good or great, but always pager turners.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|You could probably go and rate this a 9, maybe 10, depending on what it is, EXACTLY, you are rating...lol.... Let's see... In terms of rating, I'd give the story, itself, a 5;  the directing and production, a 6;  the acting, for the most part, a 7;  BUT, the show? The cause and effect?? Well, I'd have to rate those - an 11...!!!! WHOA!!!  Great Scots!! See there... It's causing me to use vocabulary terms I've NEVER used before!!  LOL... For the men, you may be bored and, quite possibly, uncomfortable...  HOWEVER, for all you woman, out there, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS!!!  It is, most definitely, a star-STUDDED cast (pun intended..lol), that will, almost certainly, leave you entertained, with plenty left over for your dreams... NO KIDDING... Although, at first, I couldn't comprehend -for the life in me- why Matthew and Channing agreed to be in, what seems to be, a low budget film...??  But then, I thought, &#34;what better way to show off your OTHER assets&#34;???  Oh my....
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game I have ever played and I have played a lot of games in my life like call of duty
B009AJD5E0|3.0|A let-down in every form and fashion!!  Wondered where they'd go with it, throughout the entire movie.. And, want a bit surprised with  &#34;where&#34; they went in the end. Although, it WAS cute. Not to mention, it only went to prove my keen ability to notice and, in this case, voice to others exactly what was going on, BEFORE it let it be known.. This movie would most likely favor the older crowds, one who had watched many of the older films, late 70s and 80s eras...
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I purchased this disc set twice. The first purchase, the 2D film disc played back with much large macro blocking of magenta and green obscuring the image. At first I thought I must need a new version of FirmWare to bring my BluRay player up to date. So I contacted Panasonic and they sent me a revised F/W disc. Once I installed the new CD-R with new F/W, the problem was the same, so I returned the set to Amazon and ordered a second copy assuming I got a bad disc. The second one arrived and I had the same problem. Doing some online searching I found I was not alone. Depending on which BluRay player you own, this particular disc may not play. It looks like certain Panasonic and Sony players will not play this disc without macroblocking, other makes and models do. Sure wish there was more uniformity on BluRay characteristics so these issues would not happen from time to time on new discs.
B000T45C32|3.0|A disappointment, to say the least.. I actually heard it was in the to 250, and can only hope that was,a joke,a rumor, a mistake, a falsity!!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|good visuals of battery status.  not sure how accurate the time estimates are after calibrations.  I still seem to use the battery up faster than I should
B0062KJ198|4.0|Although, completely unrealistic, it is hilarious! Not so much a &#34;must-see&#34; but definitely worth watching.. Good chemistry between the actors..
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|Clean Master seems to work, but it's hard to tell.  I used the program a few times before eventually deleting it from my Kindle Fire.  I find a general purpose file manager gives me more control and detail.
B006GLVGDC|5.0|Love a good laugh... But, I love it even more, when you have a macho-man male, with an &#34;A&#34;personality playing such a hilarious character! A MUST SEE (especially if you like Bruce)!!!!!
B003U6HQGW|1.0|Based on a few internet searches, it seems that this book is at least partially fake. It seems likely that someone did a walk like this, but not certain that this was it. Won't waste my time reading something that might be fiction. I want facts.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I find the story of GreyS life more interesting then the sex.  Love it.  well, written.  I really don't want it to end.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The writer did an excellent job of story-telling that kept me engaged to the very end.  What I found compelling and eerie was his description of indentured credit card delinquents, which has such a feeling of being just around the corner of reality that I would bet that such a sad fate lies somewhere in the future.<br />For a first book, this is a well-done job and worth adding to one's library.  I will be interested in reading what else the author is working on and hope that he will continue to refine his writing.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is not the first time I reach to this game.<br />The quality is great and it is entertained. Having fun time with it!<br />Nice board game.

B008OOYALE|5.0|so if you play story's by team lava you got 6 diamonds or dollers or what ever ok well I got the game and I thought that if I delete ot after I get the d/d Id quit so id did but dicided to just play a game for the fun of it I got a bunch of friend and gold what could be better p.s. read the story below<br /><br />STORY!!!<br />Ok well right after I started some person wanted to be my neighbor it was quite serperizing cuz I thought I would ask some one 1st so I said yes and I thought that he was a robot...so I put something that said ur a robot on his wall and then I discovered that he wasnt a robot cuz he used u instead of you...hahaha!!!<br />P.S. WERE FRIENDS NOW!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Sure, it's overbaked and more than a little over-the-top (to say nothing of far-fetched) but the whole thing is a guilty pleasure designed to watch while you consume an entire family-sized container of microwave lasagna or possibly a bag of cookies.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly stellar, even if season 2 finds things a bit bogged-down as far as that teeny-tiny house being used as a makeshift hospital. Maggie Smith is almost worth the price (almost) and Elizabeth McGovern was made for her role. The downstairs folk are the real attraction, as usual. Mr. Bates and his woes tend to get on the nerves, but it's all just a lot of high-brow tosh, isn't it?<br /><br />Better for your over-saturated post-modern brain than those trashy specimens from the shores of Hoboken, or wherever. Fact.
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|Good music. So jezze why FOK do I have to make my review 7 words longer. 4 more words, FOK.

B004M8AL6E|5.0|What a great story...easy to follow well put together. I enjoyed it as much as I did when it was originally shown.
B00555X8OA|5.0|if you think you know really know how good is your thinking you should read this The reality is that we do not think correctly at all I strongly recomend this book if your planning to be more accurate in the procese of personal life and business decision It all long book but good thing are not easy
B0070XB0N6|4.0|Great short book for younger readers. Loved the movie a bit more though. I felt there was actually more character and plot development in the movie (and who doesn't love blue hair?), but given what a short story this is, its okay!
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Because I have an immediate family member who has had schizophrenia since he was a teenager, I waited several years to see this movie.  Having lived it, it was hard to work up the courage to watch the movie for fear that it would make me incredibly sad. However, I caught it on TV once and after watching for a few minutes, couldn't stop and was so glad to have seen it. Now, I want my adult kids to watch it so they better understand this family member's illness and so they get the idea that even with a mental illness as severe as schizophrenia, lives like John Nash's have great value and can have great meaning and joy as well. Many of us, like me, have physical disabilities but there is often compassion and understanding for those. Mental illnesses get little compassion from others and far less understanding. This has enraged me all my life how little our society cares about people with mental illnesses. This movie helps shatter stereotypes and I think, can go a long way toward educating people about mental illnesses in general. I think it has also helped many people become less judgmental. John Nash is one of my heroes.  Russell Crowe did a fabulous job playing him.  He should have won an Academy Award for this one.  He was awesome.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't want to read this book let alone like it. I only read it to be able to have a conversation without feeling lost. But I actually enjoyed it. Not much for a bunch of kids hacking each other up, but once you focus on the political statement; it was a very good book. Appalling to think how easily we could set ourselves up for something like this to be not too far in the future.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Great story... Fantastic acting from Tom Hardy and Nolte. Amazing fight scenes.<br /><br />My only criticism is the lack of suspense built up moving toward the final scene, but this could have been (in part) due to the advertising of the movie, prior to it's release.<br /><br />Highly recommend this film.

B003EI2EH2|3.0|....but way more work to do his program than it was worth. you may only be in the gym for four hours, but every other waking minute is spent doing something else, that I'll take hitting the ellipitcal. Learned a lot though about my health and body and even working out. Great for educational read, but don't expect to find an &#34;easy&#34; fitness routine here.

B0095R76EW|3.0|Worth a rental, but not one you'll be talking about forever. Nothing memorable, but will help kill a few hours.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable. It was a little violent which is not my thing. The story made up for it though.
B006P0FIGU|5.0|Everyone in our family (parents + 4 kid) loved watching this one, highly recommended for fantasy sci fi style families
B008Z9L94O|3.0|The album is great, most of the Smashing Pumpkins fans will agree. The reissue on 4 LPs is very nice. Black in color, of very good quality. No CDs or MP3 downloads come with it (for those who were interested to know). Some clicks are noticeable, especially on the quiet first track, but on loud songs they don't bother the ear at all. Much recommended to all SM fans.<br /><br />Edit: took another listen in earphones and there is something weird on Zero. Like some strange scratching noise. Hard to tell if it is because of vinyl defect or the remastered record itself. Not a huge deal breaker for me but considering the price of this thing it should have been perfect. Deducted 2 stars from the review.<br /><br />Edit 2: Thinking about the Zero problem and about how overpriced this set is, I may probably return it.<br /><br />Edit 3: Returning it. It is just not worth the money they charge for it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I loved this sooo much i have pre ordered season 2. Definately an Adult series. Not suitable for young children. 16+ I would guess ( but being my eldest is only 11 hard to gauge and i would NOT let her watch it at this stage)
B0096Y94PI|5.0|First time purchasing music from Amazon, I am happy with the purchase, I no issues with download, songs are great.
B004EPZ0AC|3.0|Everyone in our family thought this would of become a top notch family movie. It was still a good solid movie, but it does not make the Great category. Very suitable for young kids to adult.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Seems like our hero has mellowed ... overall a good story but lacks the intensity of earlier Mitch Rapp themes.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|This was a great story. Great story line, great acting by all. Everyone loved it and we watched it many a time. Would highly recommend this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Remembered seeing this series on Netflix and absolutely loved it then.  I had forgotten about it until hearing the character, Sheldon, on The Big Bang Theory stated he had tried wished the series hadn't been cancelled.  I bought this for my DVD collection of all-time favorites.  only negative is, like Sheldon, wish there had been more episodes and seasons.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|Was disappointed in this movie had huge expectations and i do not think the moview lived up to them. Over all though still worth buying and more than suitable for young kids to adult.
0425263916|5.0|Loved the sequel.  Can't WAIT to get the third!  I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I really got my moneys worth with this dvd, the kids have probably watched it 100 times (no joke) Top notch animation, graphics, interpretation of the origianl book. What can i say but if you have young kids, go out and buy this DVD
0143116177|4.0|For some time I had been looking for a book that could give me a clear, succinct, idea of how money has been used throughout history. This interest actually came about when I was reading Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver. At one point he describes a transaction in a middle ages market in which one party cuts a coin in half to pay for his goods. This different approach to the significance of a coin was intriguing to me and I wanted to find a non-fiction book that would help me explore the topic further. After a bit of a search I came across Niall Ferguson's The Ascent of Money. A history professor at Harvard, I had known about Ferguson from his exchanges with Paul Krugman as well as his recent book tour for Civilization: The West and the Rest.<br /><br />In many ways The Ascent of Money did meet my needs. Ferguson focused on the rise of money in western civilization beginning with the first recorded loan on a tablet from Mesopotamia. He then continues with a history of the importance of Jewish money lenders, the exploitation of South American laborers for mining, and the evolution of the banking system. Chapters are broken down into mini-histories of different topics from bond markets to insurance and the changing view of the risk/return relationship. A chapter is devoted to housing as a safe investment explores not only the recent housing market collapse but also previous scandals such as the Savings and Loan Crisis in the 1980s and 1990s.<br /><br />I found the chapter on the first stock market bubble to be particularly interesting. At the center of the bubble was a man named John Law who had convinced the French monarchy to open a public bank that issued paper money. In time John Law was in many respects completely in control of France's economy. However, the system that Law introduced began to falter and when it collapsed it \\"put Frenchmen off paper money and stock markets for generations.\\"<br /><br />Ferguson finishes with a look at the rise of the West's banking system, the influence of the IMF and World Bank and the relationship between America and China. The afterword, subtitled \\"The Descent of Money,\\" explains some of what happened in the recent financial crises as well as changing view of what is acceptable risk and the acceptable level of government interaction with financial institutions.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed much of Ferguson's writing I was left wanting a bit more. For a book that is \\"A Financial History of the World\\" it seemed a bit lite, although perhaps watching the accompanying tv series would fill in some gaps. I also think it would be good to follow up with another person's view. Anthropologist David Graeber's A History of Debt which explores the history of money in terms of the relationship between debtors and creditors seems like a good choice. However, if it exists a history of behavioral economics is perhaps what I'm looking for. It was the interaction at the market and the cutting of a coin that intriguing me - the difference in how we view the significance of physical money - not the banking system as a whole.
B002R88G4U|5.0|I bought this book for its clever title, and it did not disappoint.  It's a most enjoyable and humorous story.
0061914177|4.0|Why Now is the Time to Crush It! is a mixture of things: a recanting of Vaynerchuk's childhood, an exploration of his passion for creating and growing businesses, an explanation of the technology available to today's entrepreneur, and a look at how he used this technology to build his family's business.  I'd recently listened to an interview with Gary on Mixergy so some of his business ideas were familiar to me, but I hadn't realize that he had been a successful businessman since such an early age.  Many of us have traded baseball cards, or sold some sort of collectibles to friends, but Gary went a step further and was doing market research and analysis at the age of fourteen!<br /><br />Some of the information in his book is now such common knowledge (what is facebook?) that I found myself skimming sections, but Gary offers several personal insights as well.  Although he explained how his use of video blogs and online connections are what drove the growth of his family's business, what I took from the book wasn't a list of new social media ideas to try out.  His personal development is what really interested me.  He uses the metaphor of DNA to explain how each of us has something unique that makes us tick. For him, as evident by his childhood, he knew his passion was for meeting people and building businesses.  But he also accepts that's not for everyone.  Instead, one should find what their driven to do, and do whatever that is better than anyone else. Gary sums up his rules for life as follows: Love your family, Work superhard, Live your passion.  That's it.<br /><br />Personally, I think I would have been better served if Gary had explored the topic of finding one's passion more in depth, but that was not the intent of this book.  For someone who had known what he wanted to do from such a young age Gary's focus was on developing and using those skills.  The book encourages people to find what their good at, to explore their \\"DNA,\\"  and to develop a personal brand that cashes in on that passion.  If you've begun that journey he also gives you a few suggestions and a bit of guidance.  Their not groundbreaking insights (anymore) but it's still a great place to start.  If you haven't found your passion yet than perhaps you should spend some time exploring that before picking up this book.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I will start on appositive note.  This book was very interesting.  Good plot line, well written characters and many twists and turns.  The writer clearly spent a great deal of time putting this together.  However, I hated every character in this book.  Thank God Amy in Part 2 of the book was not the doormat that she was as Diary Amy.  But, that didn't make me like her any more.  Nick is just a jerk and the supporting characters are almost as bad.  The story had major potential, but, as crazy as the twists were, I could see most (if not all)of them coming.  By the time I got to part 3 I just wanted it to end.  And end it did.  Badly.  Maybe I just expected too much.
1612680011|3.0|I was recommended Rich Dad Poor Dad by a friend and devoured the book in a couple days.  It's a classic book in the genre and has been read by millions.  I loved Kiyosaki's writing style, his use of anecdotes, and the lessons explained in the book.  Simple truths were reinforced by his success.  Or so I thought.<br /><br />On the one hand I do think many of the lessons in Rich Dad Poor Dad are true and valuable.  The basic premise that being wealthy is when your assets produce more income than you spend is a great starting point.  It doesn't matter how many millions you have if you're bleeding money, a wealthy person in Kiyosaki's mind is steadily increasing their net worth by growing their assets.  \\"Work to learn not to make money\\" is a good way to approach life as well, if you can afford it.  The fundamental lesson in the book, the idea that becoming financial literate - or building your \\"financial IQ\\" - is one of the most valuable uses of your time also struck home with me. Understanding accounting, investing, the markets and the law lets you make your money work for you.<br /><br />I did however question how easy Kiyosaki made everything seem.  It was as if after doing a little reading and studying one could simply flip a house and make $40k in an afternoon. Perhaps it's been done, but I think a good amount of luck was in the air during that transaction.  A quick search on the internet revealed that I wasn't the only one that was a little skeptical.  Critiques about the book, as well as Kiyosaki's wealth seminars that cost as much as $5k a person to attend and the $200 board game he sells, are easy to come by.<br /><br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book that you want to believe.  You read the book in two days and think, \\"if only I did these few things and spent some time studying this I could be wealthy!\\"  That's the power and the danger of the book.  Many of the fundamental lessons are worthy in my opinion, although not as unique or simple as the author may have youbelieve.  Investing in yourself and understanding how money can work for you are crucial steps in the path towards financial independence and wealth.  But, having experiencing a real-estate bubble burst one may read this book in a new light since much of the wealth creation in the book comes from investing in and flipping properties.<br /><br />I'd say it's worth it to go to your library and pick up a copy of the book.  Take a day or two to read it and think it over.  You may be inspired and excited to learn more, and that's a great thing.  Just don't think you can walk downtown and make $40 grand tomorrow afternoon.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Great addition to the other 2, just wish they had come out with it a lot sooner than they did!!!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book will help you overcome the resistance you feel from working on a new project or any other creative endeavor. Can't face a blank page--read this book.<br />Afraid to step out on the stage--read this book<br />Starting a new business and feeling paralyzed with fear---read this book.<br />Inspiring and to-the-point&#62; Doesn't pull any punches either--you are the one keeping you from starting or finishing a project..The War of Art will get you back in the flow.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|Our church youth group started making bracelets/key fobs/etc. to sell as a Relay for Life fundraiser. Most of the kids knew how to do a basic cobra weave (solomon bar), and were getting bored with it, so I bought this book.  The instructions and pictures are very clear and most of the knots and weaves turn out well.  We're ready for volume 2 to come out.<br /><br />The ties in this book do NOT require that you buy buckles for your bracelets.  One of the things I like about Lenzen's technique is that you use loops and knots to fasten bracelets.  Nothing to break or to pinch your skin.<br /><br />Keep track of how much paracord you use on each item. In places he calls for 4' and 5' would make life alot easier.  In other places, he calls for 7' and you end up with over 2' of scrap left over.  Not a big deal, but we started keeping track.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love it.. that is all.i seriously love this book and i feel as though if i say anymore i ill spoil it for you.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie Underwood has one of the best voices of the current generation, in my opinion. This album does not disappoint.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Loved the theme of the movie - young girl learning that her mother is a guiding light, rather than an impediment to her ideas of life. However, it does portray the men in the movie as courageous, yet bumbling idiots. I would caution showing it to young children as the scenes with the bears are rather intense. Otherwise, a lot of fun! and I love Scotland, so that helps too.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|Wanted to watch this because I have a massive girl crush on Natalie Portman. The romance was blah and for a rom-com this didn't even make me laugh once. Morover, Portman's character was annoying and Kutcher's absolutely bland. It was not worth my time.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Why on earth would anyone not buy this? Zep RULZ! No Quarter, For Your Life and Dazed and Confused are my favorites. Do yourself a favor and buy this. Then buy a time machine and travel back in time to 1970 and see them live at Earl's Court. You'll thank me later.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|I think this show could be even better if it were on Cable.  But for regular TV it is a good show.  Somewhat of a cross between Batman Begins and Dexter.
B000294SFW|5.0|I found this on amazon for a friend at work.  He had looked for it at many other places and couldn't find it.  When I saw it on Amazon ( at a really great Price), I had to get it for him. He was really happy, as was I that I could get it for him.
B004I654WQ|4.0|the only bad thing i have to say is that when i order this as it says blu-ray packaging it came in the dvd packaging instead which i was a bit bothered by it. My little siblings opened it before i could return it. If they didn't open it i would have returned it to get the movie in blu-ray packaging. other than that it was a good buy.
B00004WG2F|5.0|This is without any doubt the best movie I have ever watched. It has everything a person could want from a love story to an action packed movie. Brad Pitt is incredible in this movie. What an actor he has. Trust me you will not be sorry if you get this movie. Every one that I have loaned it too to watch has agreed with me that it's one of if not the best movie they have ever watched.

B00633W614|4.0|IN ORDER TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE STORY, YOU HAVE TO READ ALL SEGMENTS.  I FOUND MYSELF WAITING FOR THE STORY TO UNFOLD AND IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|In my mind this is better than 24, which was one of my favorite shows. If you love conspiracy theories, and on-the-seat-of-your-chair thrills, buy this. But block out 3 days and unplug from the world. You'll need it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i love the percy jackson books ive read all the heros of olympus ones that are out and im on the fourth percy one. i will be sad when all the books are written i hope that rick riordan makes more series. i cant wait to see what happenes to percy  and annabeth in the next book but i hav to wait till next year. please read these books cause if u dont u r missing out.  enjoy it!
B000SW4DXK|4.0|I just loved this remake of this classic movie.  Mara is just so precious in the role of Susan!  Brings the classic tale into the present day.  Well worth watching. . . more than once!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this book! So glad I found it.  As I read, I kept thinking that, if done right, it would make a great movie. I will definitely be looking for more from this author.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like the new birds and the monkeys. The monkeys move and hang on so its slightly harder to get them.  It is fun
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addictive.  I love it!  I told my friends about it and they all loved Coin Dozer.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Everyone thought it was funny.  Kids, mom, grandma.  Great G comedy for everyone.  Everyone can relates.  Little and big brothers were able to see both sides of the coin
B000OVLINI|4.0|This book gets better as it goes, with pieces of an intricate puzzle falling into place chapter by chapter.  The characters were well defined within a plot that kept luring you on.  I look forward to the next installment.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie takes place on another planet, but has an overall story line of our current Earth and how some countries treat their people. There are many scenes that preach messages that they try to hide in the overall story. The movie is great because it has a fantasy quality that is like watching a Dungeons and Dragons game play out in real life, on a different, but similar planet.<br />Oh, did I say it takes place on a planet? They seem to leave it up to the viewer to decide if the movie is on a planet, if there is magic, or as any Star Trek fan would immediately recognize as a holodeck.<br />This movie is worth owning.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a very fun game.  The early-mid levels are pretty easy and teach you some tips, then it gets harder as you progress.
B0041VV03A|3.0|I give 3 stars because the movie is like nothing you have seen, except for the last 5 minutes when the author lost imagination and needed to end it some how.<br />Not worth owning, but great to watch 1 time.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The movie was better than I had expected.  Brings all of the marvel personalities together in one movie. Great capstone to the marvel series.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app was very easy to open and use, would recommend to everyone that uses ebay. hope you download yours
0062235893|2.0|Maybe it was supposed to be obvious, but I never would have purchased this if I'd known it was an abridged version of the book.  But, it is very cuddly.  It makes a wonderful pillow for my son on his activity mat.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|Works just fine on SAMSUNG Galaxy Note II. Thanx again, Adobe, another nice piece of A in my collection, works for me. All low star reviewers, check your hardware first, can it cope with what ur trying to throw at it?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is not just one giant bedroom... or better yet, playroom scene. There is a lot of action throughout, but it is a story. The characters are well thought out and believable. I find myself wanting to scream at some characters and hug others. There are truly fifty shades of Grey. He does come off as cool, almost cold at times, but even with his short comings, I rreeeeaaaalllllyyyy love his character. I know that he has more to offer than what he thinks.
0760335540|5.0|This book will save you money in maintenance projects for your Boxster.  Written in an easy to follow manner and loaded with photos.  Highly recommend.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|If this game worked, it would be great, but on my Kindle Fire it is buggy and it will freeze my entire kindle, requiring me to recycle the power on it. Unplayable. Too bad, as this game has a lot of promise.

B001OHWDWG|5.0|Fantastic collection of Motown hits. This spans the best years of Motown. Many old favorites as well as a few I hadn't heard previously.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, who has already watched it 3 times<br />and with guests sleeping over this weekend, I suspect many<br />more times!
0761169253|5.0|This book was a very simple read. I read it in two sittings, but it could easily be read in one. Every page has great tidbits of advice and inspirational thoughts. It has helped me as a college student in being more effective in my studies. It flows well and the pictures and figures help keep the book moving along quickly. I highly recommend this book to those with high stress or writer's block. It'll help clear your mind and help push you to try new things. Well worth the read!
B007V65R54|4.0|The information is no doubt accurate -- as confirmed in the last election.  My only complaint about this book is that some sections are a bit over-written.  That's a very small complaint:  easy reading is damned hard writing and by and large this is easy reading.  I'd be proud of having written this book.  Mr. Silver should be too.
B000WQW988|5.0|I bought the MTV dvd released previously but I think we needed more. Here this dvd brings it up. We can see everything you want to know about the event and enjoy the making of it.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Im not the biggest, diehard Alien fan but I do like the movies. They look great and this is packed full of special features. I am a little disappointed to see that this is now $30.... I mean its a steal! I paid $70 back in May on Amazon and I believe I got my moneys worth so, $30 is a no-brainer!
B000IZ6FLK|4.0|I loved the plot; however I found the origin of his trauma a little disappointed -it needed more justification or elaboration.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I am so proud of Phillip Phillips! I love this album. I pre ordered it and got it first thing on the 19th of November. I have since been listening to it every day to and from work. Songs 1-9 are especially good! I wish him nothing but the best.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|At the beginnign you get dragged by the stories and interesting theories about our behaviour but later on the discourse get too long about the same thing or common sense stuff.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy in this film?  It's hard to tell at first.  Dickie (Jude Law) is the wild child in the first half, while Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) seems like a nerd.  It's at half-time that Dickie calls Tom &#34;boring&#34; and drops off screen, and we're left with the impression that the movie is going to drag through the 2nd half.  But it's not true -- the 2nd half of the movie is the real thriller, and it flies by.  We ought to know better - most of us have followed Matt Damon through Bourne after Bourne and never got bored.  I wasn't too thrilled with the ending though - would have liked something a little more cheery.  It sets Ripley up for his coming career, in films such as Ripley's Game (starring John Malkovich) in which he's completely polished up his fiendish act.  Both films are based on a book series, but I just recently found out about this, to my surprise. &#34;Talented&#34; is an interesting if uneasy introduction to this disturbing character.
0385302320|5.0|Been a Gabaldon fan for decade or more.  Can't get enough of the Dragonfly series.  Can't wait for the next installment.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read.... its a special book. Its a real piece of art.
B002UNMW7O|3.0|Good enough and great to see the boys back in action, but nowhere near the movie Saints #1 was.  I'd buy it again, just to have the set.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I like all the tracks. Superb. in the air tonight is my most favorite. i wish to attend one of the concert by him.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't like gore, ... but I'm amazed at how the 'walker' look throughout this show. The makeup crew is outstanding! I don't watch this for the SciFi aspect. There IS a good story line behind it, the characters have depth and emotion. I look forward every week! Love The Walking Dead since Season 1!
0821221841|4.0|Ansel Adams deserves a lot of credit for getting photography recognized as an art as well as technical advances in the field.  Even though he worked with film (mainly black and white), and large format cameras, the principles he discusses in this book \\"The Camera\\" as well as his other books are still relevant today and found in modern incarnations in digital cameras, Photoshop, and the like.<br /><br />For anyone who is serious about photography and interested in understanding the underpinnings more deeply in order to take better photos rather than editing them into a better state afterwards, I recommend this book.<br /><br />I do however have to include the comment that Ansel Adams, while an artistic genius, was also very detail oriented and his writing, while enlightening, is sometimes dry and tedious.<br /><br />-William Milberry
0385344228|4.0|The physical condition of book and the timeliness in receiving it were more than adequate.  The contents of the book left something to be desired.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|If you are a fan of English history and /or a fan of Gregory's books, you will love this addition to the books about the Cousins' War.
0547848412|2.0|The 2 star rating I have given this book implies nothing about the allurement held within its pages. The beautiful plot (based on a true story) is one of the best ever written. It *could* have been my new favorite novel. What ruined it for me? The foul language. Sadly, there was much of it mixed in. So much that my 5 star rating had to drop down to only 2 measly stars.<br /><br />The story itself is (as I have already mentioned) BEAUTIFUL. It starts in Pondicherry, India, with Piscine Molitor Patel, the son of a zookeeper. The chapters fly by with colorful descriptions. Vibrancy illuminates off the pages. Then---the shipwreck, and the endless weeks spent at sea. So accurately written. Every detail that one could think of has been packed into this novel. Yes, there are gruesome parts. \\"Life of Pi\\" is not intended for the weak in stomach, heart, or imagination. But learning about this struggle for survival is well worth it.<br /><br />Religious notes: Atheism is mentioned a few times. Also, in addition to Christianity, the religions of Hinduism and Islam are discussed in much detail. As a Christian myself, I naturally desired the Christian aspects brought up in the storyline, and found the details of the other religions quite interesting, to at least learn about.<br /><br />Overall, I found the book to exude such a memorizing tie that led me to relish in the story, actually wishing that I was there experiencing the hardships of trying to live at sea. Again, I say, it's a beautiful book. If the foul language didn't have to mess it up for me, I would have gained a new favorite.
B007THA4FI|1.0|It is hard to imagine that the writer who gave us Harry Potter could write a book this bad. This may  be one of the worst books I've ever read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Give this game a whirl! At first it's very very easy, but it definitely gets harder. You can even choose to skip ahead to the harder levels if you're up for more of a challenge. I've had the app for about a week, I'm at a stand still on the 9x9 levels.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I ordered it like new  but opened and thats just how it came. No scratches or anything. Just as discribed.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I had to own it on Blu-ray. I can't wait to see where the next movie takes us.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|As usual Will Smith is great.  This is a fun movie.  If you liked the first in this series you will like this one.
B0068FYZZW|5.0|I love this movie. Great coming of age movie. It brings back so many memories. I had to own it on Blu-ray.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Many of the characters seemed inconsistent. Daisy, Werner, Frieda, Voloyda-I found it hard to understand their thinking and attitudes at different parts of the book!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|If you're a brony with a need for some stress relief and an extra shot of love and tolerance in your day, download this game. A bit slow to start but it picks up and doesn't beg for your money.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I like the way Tim Ferris brings up interesting facts, and effective ways of learning.  However, this book tends to &#34;jump around&#34; more than his other books.  Still, it is a worthwhile read, not just for cooking, but for learning in general.
0143038419|2.0|To see great stories about physical/emotional/spiritual journeys, read \\"Unbroken\\" or watch \\"The Way\\" or \\"The Way Back\\".  This movie had great potential but just didn't reach into my soul and grab me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A great mystery<br />The middle has a surprise that changes the whole story.<br />You want to read and read until you get to the end.
B006YC74E8|3.0|I'll update as I use. Took pics and saved but cannot find on my device or cloud. this is very frustrating.
B00846REIS|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. I think that it is very similar to the 50 shade series with a little less of the &#34;blushing&#34; factor. I enjoyed how Sylvia Day portrays the characters.
0345803507|5.0|I purchased Fifty Shades of Grey, liked the story and was compelled to purchase part II and then part III. I love it....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you are working on a transition from the 50 Shades series, this book is for you. Personally, I enjoyed it a little more because there was more to the story than just the two main characters. Sylvia Day does a good job refreshing you on characters and situations from the first book.The ending was very sudden though.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We enjoyed this movie both in the theatre and as a download.  Lots of action, humor and the language wasn't toooo bad for kids.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I own every CD of Norah's and can't say one bad thing about any of them. This CD is a little different than others but it's still amazing.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|An intrigueing tale that spins its tangled web drawing you in page by page. A story about two lives manipulated for the sake of it. In the end love is the trump card in the Tarot deck. A wonderful journey well worth taking.
B00555X8OA|5.0|...joking haha :)) wait, I'm not joking! Things will be much more clearly seen, you'll become less eager to judge people and events and more shameful of your humble self.. I know, I know what it sounds like :) relax, it's just the careful but quite thorough description of what comes and goes in your mind when you are about to judge or decide or measure things. And an even more intriguing description of what doesn't happen there, of the shortcuts your own mind takes to bypass things that are probably worth looking at. Know yourself better = read this book. Cheers.
B002PNF8HK|4.0|I love the imagination of this movie. Effects are good, acting is ok but not great. Crazy people make crazy movies.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|Have been a regular on Facebook.  Now I have the fun of watching it on Kindle.  Clear and better pictures.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|dear amazon. i liked the batman movie. its an excellent action movie with a lot of action in it. i wacthed it all a couple times now and i still cant get tired of it. in this movie, batman is still trying to keep gotham city safe by getting all the bad guys. but this time there is the joker (RIP mr ledger) in it. the joker is crazy and he wants to kill more people if gotham city doesnt meets his demnands. to make sure he got leverage, the joker make frinds with other bad guy of gottham city. together the bad guys are trying to find a way to get rid of batman and become rich again. the joker is played by heath ledger and batman is played by christian bale. mom says both of them are real mens. i like the acting a lot, in my opinion, i think heath ledger is so good he is stealing the show. very good acting in the movie. i know what happen to mr ledger and i am sorry, he was a very good actor. please go see that movie amazon and you wont regret it becoze it is very,very good.<br /><br />your frind kent
B003G4W49C|5.0|After reading the book for the first time, I have no doubt it will live in my heart forever. I'll never forget this one.
B002ZG999U|5.0|dear amazon, i like the expendable movie a lot. mom says its full of real mens. the movie has all the best action actors of the 80's and 90's and more. this is like an \\"all star\\" action movie with some of the best actors in the wurld. i think sylvester stallone is the leader of this crew, consisting of his friends. together they will fight the bad guys. i think one of then is stone cold steve austin, one of the best wrestler of all time. my frind says the expendables 2 is even better. oh boy! i sure would like to see it.the edxpendable is a real action roller coaster, you cant fall asleep while watching this its impossible, theres too much action in the movie to be bored. mom says its a classic. you go watch that movie amazon and you'll see i was right.<br /><br />your frind kent
B003O86FMW|5.0|Th second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire, is a great book that held me in suspense till' the end. The wide vocabulary and clever wording had me hooked from the moment I began this book. It is a book for an audience a little older than I am, which is 12, but I loved it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is written in letter form, which I found to be rather boring. The letters are written to you, the reader.<br />The plot is conceived gradually and the reader can follow easily.<br />A sad tale, but one which ends in a surprise.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Great prequel. Well done. I was entertained by it and would watch again. I rarely watch movies twice mind you :-).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|OK, I'll admit it -- I'm an oldster who hadn't heard of this series (we've never had cable) until this past Black Friday when it was on sale very cheap and I needed another item to get free shipping.  I love science fiction, I grew up on Westerns, so the combination sounded interesting and I ordered.  Now I'm hooked.  This series is superb.  It has good character development, a good premise (a rough-and-tumble space frontier 500 years in the future) and succeeds very well in combining the action and style of a Western with survival on an old ship in outer space.  The premise -- a band of renegades struggling to survive while avoiding the oppressive new Alliance government -- makes for good conflict, along with cannibalistic Reavers and gangs of nefarious bad guys.  (Sure, the Serenity crew are a bunch of outlaws, but they are really the good guys.)  The design of the \\"Firefly class\\" ship is very creative, too -- it does resemble a firefly when the engines light up the stern, which gave me my \\"aha!\\" moment as to why a science fiction series would be named after a bug.  My only complaint about \\"Firefly\\" is that there wasn't enough of it.  Fox really blew it when they canceled this before the end of the first season! Had it been on another network, one that understands good SF, it no doubt would have run much longer.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Don't expect oscar worth performances, but just a decent story (that EVERYONE knows) and good entertainment. I enjoyed it myself.
B004AQR24W|1.0|This movie has no plot, instead it rambles around and is boring stories about the loves lives of geurillas BORING
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|cute game not to hard to figure out nice beginner game of dragons will be sure to share with my granddaughters .
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Ian McEwan may be the best writer of Engllish prose in the world today. What distinguishes his writing is the great subtlety with which the foibles of love, treachery, and political intrigue are seamlessly woven together. &#34;Sweet Tooth&#34; takes its name from a particularly bizarre program of MI-5, the British intelligence agency, involving a high level of cold war propaganda using literary &#34;agents&#34; to counter idealistic Communist messages. An unwitting beautiful female literary scholar struggling within the ranks of a crass male-dominated agency is the tool used to ensnare unsuspecting writers as literary proxies in the scheme to spread the message of a democratic free world in an era when the balance of world thought seems threatened as much as the Berlin wall does at a physical level. The deceptions at a political level are mirrored in the deceptions taking place within the love relationships, in which the perennial battle of the sexes merges with  bungling and deceptive spying. As in all of McEwan's writing, the framework for the plot serves as a vehicle for penetrating insights into larger issues involving human nature, the world of ideas, and fundamental moral issues. None of this detracts from the sheer pleasure of the spy thriller.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I read the first book of the trilogy and liked it better. I was very disappointed. I will still read the 3rd book and hope for the best.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I wanted a diary for my kindle and downloaded this. I love it. I love that you can change the title and color of your notebook. I have one for ideas for songs memos and a diary. Definitely get this app.
B00628RVV0|5.0|There was nothing in this film that I didn't like.  The story, the characters, the acting, they all were good.  The precepts of Nazi Germany came back to destroy it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great read. So interesting 2 think how life would b if time travel was possible. Not sure IF agree w/ the Oswald take on Kennedy‘s assassination but the detail put into the story was amazing. The characters were the best part & really draw you in from the beginning. All in all a great read, beware of the very long read though!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I heard this production on PBS and it is just fantastic!  The singers along with the after concert excitement when 4 Jean Valjean's on stage was just wonderful.  Love this version of Les Miserables!!!!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|App is easy to read &amp; quite accurate in the short time I've used it. It offers plenty of info.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I can't wrap my mind around having simutaneous novels going. Having to read one and remember what happened to put it in perspective is difficult when you aren't constantly reading. It is normally half way through the chapter that I vaguely remember something that I read 2-3 months earlier that makes sense out of the passage.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The player has few imperfections here and there but works perfectly. The downloads are fast too.<br />Highly recommended for downloading YOUTUBE videos.
0062060562|5.0|This book is brilliant, raw, and emotional.  S.J. Watson is an author I will follow for years to come - his storytelling ability is superb and his mastery of wordcraft is amazing.  This book made me cry, and it made me afraid - it is a must read and a great gift!<br /><br />This book tracks Christine, an amnesiac who wakes up next to her husband, Ben, but she recognizes neither him, nor herself. Every day Christine awakens as a young woman, or a child, unable to recall the last 20 years of her life. As she begins to track her reappearing memories in a journal, she works to find out what is fact, what is lies, and what is her imagination.<br />The end will shock you. This is a book that will keep you on the edge until the very last page.<br /><br />Five enthusiastic stars!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|kids loved it and so did I<br />saw at theater but could watch again it was very funny and warm
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven has to be one of the best N.S books I have ever read I began reading it with some slight disappointment worried it would end like The Best of Me, but it did not. I love this book!
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|Combined with the special effects of today, slightly different storyline and plot, filled with plenty of action this movie is definitely worth a watch
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Angry Birds=Crack lol.The graphics on this one are so cool that it just made me smile from beginning to end that I was playing..plus,it shuts the kids up :D
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Found it very difficult to put down. Author kept my interest right up to the last page. Can't wait to begin the next novel.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Its a decent app that does what it says it does & im happy with it.Free,wonderful & awesomely looks good on my kindle fire HD.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Newsfeed doesn't go down very far. You only get about 12 posts. Should be able to scroll down but it stops.
B005OK722U|1.0|This 3rd part of the Hostel chain was a total mess.  Not scary at all, and pretty much nothing more than a stupid Vegas T&A show.  Too bad that Eli Roth left this series of making these films.  He's very talented when it comes to scare and gore flicks, but Part III of the franchise is a mess.<br /><br />Watch at your own risk.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Personally, I'm not a fan of Christina Aguilera so I almost didn't watch this film, but it was fabulous, even Christina.  It was very well done and I enjoyed it immensely!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This story is clever. Originally, I saw it on Netflix and had to buy it and have my own copy! Ive watched it multiple times and never get tired of it.
0553280325|4.0|This is a great book...sadly, I just didn't like it as much as I did 30?? years ago...but that's me; not Bradbury.  I've been reading a book of 100 of his best stories, and it reminded me how incredible a writer he is.  I hate to say it, but I don't think there are many imaginations like his anymore....imagination is, I fear, a casualty of the push into cyber space....I also love that many of his short stories refer to other classic writers, like Edgar Allan Poe...and remind (me) to read them again.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I loved this series so much that after watching it on PBS, I bought the DVD so I could watch it again on my TV. The story is compelling and I really care about the characters. I have to tell myself they aren't real because I've dreamt and even blogged about them. Great story.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I purchased this app for the day feature, the swipe dimming feature and mostly because it supposedly had an update on the local weather. Well apparently its always 37 degrees in my area because that's the only weather temperature that ever displays despite my uninstallation and reinstallation of the app. Bummed because its a cute clock with dependable alarm features, guess we can't have it all, huh?
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I normally stay away from &#34;chic lit&#34; (even though I'm a woman) but I decided to give this a try after reading the description. The book is great! The author is funny, down to earth, and connects well with the reader. This is a very inspirational and thought-provoking book. Good for anyone who is going through a break-up or just kind of at a standstill in life.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|AWESOME!!!!!!! Get this Blue Ray. You will love it! Best DVD I have ever purchased! Love it! Buy it now!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I enjoyed the book and found it to be an interesting story. The only thing that kept me from a higher rating was the profanity...While I'm not against it being used when appropriate, or occasionally, I feel it was used a bit too much. Other than that, I enjoyed the story and I found it entertaining.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Slow starting , wished John t was in the movie more, very confusing<br />Story line was confusing to follow, I didn't finish the movie
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love ed this book and I cannot wait till the house of Hades comes out. Best book ever thanks
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|best book ive ever read i couldt stop reading it , i cant wait for the next book to come out
B002PNDEXK|5.0|I just finished reading the book. Jane Austen has been compared with Shakespeare in her own domain.  The film beautifully brought alive the best of the book. It was a pleasure to watch.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I very much enjoy the take Nix has in this series.  Not brain-food but very enjoyable read if you have some time to kill.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|My nephews absolutely loved the first wimpy kid movie and was waiting for holiday time to order this one on Blu-ray.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Definitely worthwhile. The book explores the underlying reasons that some people are able to become great successes. Everything from Bill Gates to the impact of summer vacation on poor students. This is my favorite book of '12.
B009VB97EY|5.0|A bonus that most of it was shot in and around Pinellas Co., FL  so I got to see plenty of my hometown sites on the big screen.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Read this book if you have had an idea for a small business in mind for awhile but just don't know where to begin. I think some people are disappointed that the book doesn't have more insight into what they should sell. If you have in mind something you are passionate about and have always wanted to make money doing the book will speak to you.
0525953728|3.0|If you like facts, detailed weapon descriptions, and methodical geospatial recountings then this is the book for you.  I was distracted by the relative apathetic, almost detached way the story was told.  The author's perspective is very one dimensional from character descriptions to lessons learned.  He describes killing people in the same manner one might order lunch.  I'm not sure if that is intentional or just the character trait of someone who can do what he did.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I am a functional crafter. Meaning I don't usually make things unless it has a good purpose. This is a perfect addition to my crafting. It had a wonderful price and it is simple enough to use. I still need to work with it a little more because I am still doing it a little wrong but that is my fault. This is a wonderful product and the seller did a wonderful job.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Being a rocker from the 80's I was really looking forward to this movie and was a little dissappointed.<br />The songs they used werent the 80's songs I loved, nor was the lifestyle portrayed accurately - but I took it for what it was supposed to be - a fun and alternate view of a very fun time. I hate Tom C - but loved his performance here.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great show! Great to be able to see it anytime and good quality. It is so convenient to purchase shows just a few days after they aired if we missed them on tv.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Johnny Depp does it again. This movie went beyind my expectations. Perfect for any Depp fan - I love the blue-ray combo packs.
0062082353|3.0|From the perspective of somebody who can't even imagine all the things Chris Kyle experienced and felt while bringing death upon our enemies nor how he transferred to the battlefield to home and back... and keep a family intact, I had high hopes for this book, but alas was kind of let down. This was indeed an interesting story of Kyle's life and experiences as a US Navy SEAL but it lacked a certain...literary touch. The book is an autobiography plus a collection of \\"war stories\\" and Mrs. Kyle's thoughts while her husband was being a killing machine and its effect on their relationship in general. The \\"war stories\\" are cool... I like Kyle's in your face style and stories of some of his exploits but midway through the book it became somewhat repetitive and boring. He mixes it up and discusses his home life but it lacked enough feeling for me to really empathize with the Kyles. Granted, Kyle is an American hero and bad ass SEAL and not an author by trade I would think that his editors would have given him more literary advice. He uses gruff military language, which doesn't offend me at all, but then he uses more sanitized language, back and forth. He also refers to some exploits or descriptions of things he did multiple times which left me asking myself, \\"didn't he already talk about this verbatim\\"?<br /><br />Oh well it was a cool book none the less. Chris Kyle is a real American hero and patriot with a real warriors spirit.
B000002J7U|5.0|The first song is really a winner, while the rest of the CD is almost as wonderful.  One of Vangelis's best.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This is the stupid re-release version that ruined star wars.  The originals should be released on blu-ray too.  There was no reason to alter a masterpiece.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Found so many ideas here. It helps me organize and helps me research the things that I'm interested in. I find it quite refreshing.
B0084I22OW|5.0|My sister loaned me the book and it took me forever to start it. But when I did, I couldn't put it down. Hysterical book about a man who lives in his own little world out in our own little world. The cat in the weenie cart part had me crying with laughter. BUY THIS BOOK! Absurdity at it's best!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Typical John Corey novel. The sarcasm and side bars are some of the best by DeMille in his John Corey series. I believe I have read just about everything written by DeMille. I found the book to be very entertaining and enjoyable. The plot has turns and twists to keep the reader guessing and wondering. I would have given 5 stars but I felt there were a number of conflicts that Corey et al were facing that were not resolved. Somehow, magically, they are back in the US. Nonetheless, get the book---it is an entertaining read that one expects from DeMille.
B007MDB548|5.0|&#34;Secret of the Wings&#34; is another fun installment in the fairy series. The story line of Tink having a sister is creative and a neat twist. Coupled with why the realms of the fairy world were separated and how that is resolved adds to the quality of the movie. With the interesting story line, lovable characters and all around charm, this is good, clean fun for the whole family. Especially our four year-old princess and her cousins.<br /><br />The 3D offers some fun effects, but like other current 3D offerings, no one is really setting the standard or blazing a new trail.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Very slow to start, but it picked up for me around chapter 13 or so. I was joined by the end! But still disappointed that it wasn't directly about Thomas and his role in creating the Maze. Is there another prequel??
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|As the write-up does not explicitly state this, I will. This is NOT a drawing app or like the real pc Photoshop. This app is for photo filtering... albeit, fancier than Picsay Pro... but still essentially \\"afterthought editing\\". If you want a drawing app, get Sketchbook Pro.
B001HQZJP2|1.0|I originally ordered the unrated version, but got the PG instead. I Already had unrated on DVD, but wanted Blu-Ray
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is great. The first time I used it was so intense. As I went along I got better and more able to do everything, but it was just in time to move up to the next level. I've seen a serious improvement in my strength as well as my physical appearance.
B00005LOUP|5.0|This is the third DVD I have purchased.  They keep leaving my house with one grandchild or another.  I'm locking this one up.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Although I don't plan on using the UV digital copy, I do not find it necessary to rate this movie 1 star! It is an awesome action movie that closes one story while opening up another.<br />Plus, there is the viewing experience! Booming explosions, great acting, suspenseful plot, amazing special effects...what more could you want? I personally like this movie much more than Batman Begins, but not as much as I love the Dark Knight. Having said that, this movie is absolutely worth the buy.<br />Please stop rating it 1 star for the UV copy!
B000VBIGD6|4.0|My family has always loved to play Christmas Vacation as we put our tree up.  Our tradition was always to go out in the woods and find our own tree.  We had many adventures over the years looking for just the right tree and getting it back home.  This year when we put our tree up we discovered our copy was missing so we had to have another.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The acting, the details, the plot, the special effects... They really outdid themselves this time. My jaw dropped multiple times, I got chills, and my mind was blown multiple times (I had to pause it just to appreciate the awesomeness!). The second season has a dramatic, epic twisting plot that will keep you guessing. The final frames of the season will make you scream at your TV because you can't let it end there!<br /><br />I only read the Song of Ice and Fire books casually, and I did notice a few differences between this season and A Clash of Kings. Did they make me hate this season? Absolutely not! The complexity of the book (728 pages) couldn't possibly fit in 10 episodes, so alterations had to be made, and I am ok with that. I love both the book and this season. I can't wait for this season to come out on blu ray!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|First of all I like Christmas music.  I have a fairly large collection however it is mostly comprised of Classical and Jazz.  When it comes to \\"Pop\\"  versions I have tended to like the vintage rock (50's -60's) stuff. Why? Because personally I found the treatment of the songs to be interesting and a worthy addition to the huge amount of Christmas music out there. Then came along Annie Lennox. She gets 5 stars for her bold, direct approach to the (in many cases) centuries old carols. There is a stark quality to her songs that puts this in a wintery mode which is really refreshing as there are a ton of  sentimental or total rock out recordings out there.  Annie occupies a special niche and this deserves to be a classic. A must have in your collection!
B007V65R54|5.0|One of the few books I've read that made numbers exciting. (I was an English major!)  With poker, hurricanes, politics, baseball, earthquakes intertwined, the signal floated through the noise in enough settings that even a literary idiot could make sense.  Especially liked the weather sections.  Also, as a political junkie, the accuracy of the election polling results.
0547884591|5.0|Great Book soo far (was finally finishing up & actually implementing the 4HB ,slow carb & Occams Protocol & about to do my 1st 1/2 marathon w' some of Tim's 'hacks/short cuts'); i am an avid casual chief (for me my family, dates, etc...) & the Meta-Learning (DUDE! hard to fall asleep at nites w' all these 'hacks/short-cuts' & ways to hit the Top 5% in a 6mth time frame). Aside from the fact that the book is as big as a freakin BUS, it's worth it, take it in BITE SIZE pieces (ah see what i did there). I have found several areas i will target to be the Top 5% in the world (most important is creating a 4HWW biz, vs working for the Bank i currently do, not fun times right now don't ya know) AND tackling 1 recipe per week to work on. Has humor & intelligence & real world applications (unlike majority of the college & MBA classes i have taken). Thanks Tim, appreciate it, can't wait for the nxt one! (and CONGRATS on beating the Man that was trying to BAN your book)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I haven't really been into reading much in literally like 10 years and had a friend tell me \\"You have to read this\\" so I did and now I am seriously addicted.  I finished the entire trilogy in a week because I couldn't put it down & am now on to similar books to this one.  I absolutely LOVE this series & hope that the series continues!!!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|By far the best story of the three. Tied up all loose ends but one.. Left us with one loose end which I suspect will be tied up in the next installment.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|very unique story. i was hooked and had to fight to put it down! i would suggest it for a book club.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|I have really enjoyed this album.  Her voice is so soothing and relaxing, that I listen to it over and over again.
0316212377|1.0|Iain M Banks is one of my favorite authors.  But not because of The Hydrogen<br />Sonata.<br />The book is well written, the plot moves along quite well, but at the end<br />you have nothing.... a resolution, but not one you care about.  All in all<br />it seemed a chance to write about AI's, create conversation, and enjoy the<br />witty names of their ships.  Not worth the effort.
B000005GYI|5.0|I'm almost ashamed to admit that my exposure to Milton Nascimento first came through the duet he sang with Esperanza Spalding, Apple Blossoms, which I'm performing myself in an upcoming gig. But in 1972, when this album was recorded, Nascimento was at his vocal best. In the duet with Spalding, it is the haunting weakness of his aging voice that is perfectly suited for the piece. I've heard some scalding criticisms of his performance in that piece, but I cannot help but believe it to be nothing short of exquisite. After spending years attempting to learn how to sing \\"perfectly\\" (whatever that means), I've found that the most \\"perfect\\" singers are those who embrace the imperfections of their voices and learn to tell the story with the instrument they have; refusing to apologize for the humanity of it.<br /><br />That being said, Nascimento in his youth was the sound of vocal perfection... or nearly so.<br /><br />In the beautiful Brazilian manner, he soars above the rhythm section below. Moving away from the traditional Brazilian sound, Nascimento is sometimes using a sound that is familiar to North American audiences. Maybe this was part of the reason that his album was well received. But then in his super-short Saidas E Bandeiras No 1, he reminds us that he has not forgotten where he's from. The ability to pass from falsetto into his full voice with virtual seamlessness, is impressive from the perspective of vocalist. But even beyond simple vocal ability, Nascimento is a really good musician. Listen to him in Nuvem Cigana. Those melodic passages are based in the harmonic movement. Today it would be likely that the voice and guitar would be laid separately, but in the early 70's, it was just as likely that Nascimento sang the passages along with the guitar. And they are perfectly in sync, almost not separate from each other in the chorus. Not only do the notes match, but the vocal tone is in the same timbre of the guitar, and voice and guitar are both perfectly in the \\"center\\" of the pitch.<br /><br />On Dos Cruces, we are given another look at the vocal ability as Nascimento incorporates the Spanish flavor with Arabic roots in the way he plays around the pitch. It's before it's time, and is stunning. As we move on in the album, we're exposed to a more traditional Brazilian sound, and then we hear almost art-song-esque pieces and those seemingly influenced by early lute and chant music as with San Vincente.<br />You have to listen to this album more than once to get all the nuances, and every time you hear it, you'll hear something else. It's true art. True experimental music. Truly unique.e \\"center\\" of the pitch.<br /><br />On Dos Cruces, we are given another look at the vocal ability as Nascimento incorporates the Spanish flavor with Arabic roots in the way he plays around the pitch.

B0043UB0EI|5.0|It's gritty, violent, bloody and erotic at the same time while being politically intriguing. It is stylized just like the movie &#34;300&#34;. Depicting Roman life as historians believe it to be means there is a lot of full frontal nudity of men and women and extremely graphic sex scenes. It's about gladiators so OBVIOUSLY it is chock full of bloody and gory fighting in the arena. Great production value.<br /><br />The storyline is captivating, the blood and sex perhaps excessive and gratuitous yet I couldnt wait to watch the next episode every time.
B002UXRGLG|4.0|Good, but about 50% of the stuff is from Planet Earth, although in this video they go into more detail in some areas. Worth the purchase though.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I love the movie.  I bought the 5 disc set because I couldn't find the theatrical release by itself in Blu-Ray.  I am not a fan of the Director's cut, mostly because all of the voice over narration is taken out.  Buying a 5 disc set is probably overkill if you are not already a fan of the movie.
B006P4HFH6|3.0|The beginning of this series was edgy and compelling. About halfway through the images and events became a bit too familiar and tedious. The last episode was downright silly and added nothing to the series.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The original thrill of seeing it has gone but it was great to get the 3d version after 3yrs. The best price I ever found was 149.00 now I can watch it at home.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|The Fight Scenes between Lincoln and the Vampires are well worth the Price of the DVD alone.. The Man knows how to weld an Axe. Never a dull moment in this Film.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Is loved it. I had wait for crops to grow but it's still fun. There are so many dragons to breed. Awesome game. &lt;3
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I liked it.  Found the story to be interesting and well told.  Not her best work but still a nice read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|enjoyed every episode.  Well done.<br /><br />Cudos toWGBH for bringing it to Masterpiece. I Can't wait for season 3 to begin
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoy Grisham's works.  He tells a good story and keeps the reader's interest throughout the novel.  I will continue to read Grisham's work.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|A must have for pony fans and bronies but not for those that are looking for anything fast pace. This is more or less farmville with the mane six but its different enough to enjoy.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this is a great angry birds games. got to love the pigs and the birds!<br />happy holidays everyone in the world!
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|I have apps on my Acer Iconia tablet that do not free up RAM memory as they should and they do it inconsistently. Now, I simply set the RAM booster to clear memory and lo and behold, I don't any longer run low on memory. The app is easy to use and reasonably easy to understand but most importantly, it works consistently and correctly. Good job!
B00A77II0U|4.0|the game had a very dark story line. not for young children. but it was interesting and I enjoyed the game play. wish it was twice as long but it took me several hours to get through all the content.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|It made me laugh and cry in equal measure, and I really couldn't put the book down. At one point I thought I might just start walking too.  Best book I've read in a long time.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|I enjoyed it but it was very predictable. I expected just a little more from this annimated Batman, but it just wasn't there.<br />Gerard Labrecque
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Previewing the songs before buying it didn't do justice for it. After listening to the entire CD a couple of times then i even liked the songs I thought I wouldn't have liked. Amazing voice. I'll get 21 next or may get the concert in Blue Ray disc.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|This app Is an almost there app. I think after a few bug fixes it will be very handy. But for now honestly, it's not with my time. I can go to mSN and get my mail just the way I want it the first time. I'm sure this app willl see some improvements over time and then it will be very handy. Till then... Not for me.<br />Gerard Labrecque
B0026IUXME|5.0|I am a World War II History buff and this story is amazingly gripping.  Acting is well done, visuals are extremely accurate.  To think of one lone man facing these impossible odds it mesmerizing.  Would recommend to anyone.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Received this product on time and exactly as advertised! Highly recommend this movie for any kids or for any of us &#34;Older Kids&#34;!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought the writing was simplistic.  Other than that, I wish I had read what the book was about because I didn't know I was getting into erotica, so I was a bit disappointed.  And I don't like the way the writer left the ending of the book.  Maybe that's what a &#34;good&#34; writer does, but it doesn't appeal to me.  It's like she wrote this book with the full intention of dragging it out into the next book and then the next book.  This ensures her three best sellers (if in fact it should become a best seller, which obviously, it did).  However, even if it had NOT been erotica, I would not have continued to the next book, because I rather resent someone wielding me around by a nose ring and that's how I see her &#34;if you want the REAL ending to this plot, you have to buy my next book, AND my NEXT book&#34; idea.  It may be good business, but I find it really offensive!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I would give it 5 stars if it had a few more functions.  I can't complain because what is here works flawlessly.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Received quickly and in excellent condition. My wife loves Johnny Deppe and was very happy with her purchase. This DVD has worked very well when we received it and it is still working good. Would purchase again if the need arises.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I got this for a gift, but have it myself and love the story line.  It's a movie everyone should see!
B009XTF8JM|5.0|I am the kind of horror movie fan who loves the ones that make you jump.<br />I've been trying to find something as good as \\"The Ring\\" for a while and I have to<br />say this is it.<br />It will make you jump, has a great story, and was totally worth the price of a movie ticket!
B0098NSCSM|5.0|This is a small, quiet film of great emotional intensity. A small group of friends take one of their number who is gravely ill to visit a favorite place for the last time. Their experiences, their discussions, the revelations come across as honest and true. The actors are all great, but especially Benedict Cumberbatch as the young man dying of cancer. His portrayal is gentle, fierce and vulnerable and he brings authenticity without self pity to his character's final choice. I just wish that this would come out as a DVD for those of us in America. I for one would immediately order a copy.
B00014X8KO|5.0|All was well, and were very careful with protecting my order! What gives more security to rely on next order.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The special effects were dazzling and Charlize Theron did a fine job as the queen, but I just couldn't feel much of anything for any of the characters in the film.
B008MLNDEO|5.0|I can picture every scene in the movie when I hear this soundtrack.  Great movie!  Great soundtrack!  Best Daniel Day Lewis movie besides Lincoln.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|this movie is adorable.  NOT for kids but definately the PERFECT date movie.  i wish my teddy bear was Ted!
B009JBZH54|1.0|I thought it was too good to be true and it was.  The trilogy is great except that it is missing one major area...special features.  If you want them at all, skip this version and wait for them to be added in on later trilogy versions.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserable speaks for itself. An amazing piece of historical fiction, and a beautiful musical. I honestly don't know what I could say that hasn't been said elsewhere before.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Just received this Kindle Fire cover today. The Kindle snaps into place with four plastic corners. The port chords have easy access in case. I use the Kindle in the kitchen while I cook for recipes, listening to music as well as Facebook and emailing. Believe it or not, while doing Thanksgiving baking,  I put the Kindle in a clear food storage bag to protect it while in the kitchen working. While it protected the Kindle from flour,eggs, whatever...the best feature is the ability to prop Kindle at an angle for viewing.I wouldn't want to spend more than $24.99 for a case, there's no need to with this product. I give it an A+.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love How I Met Your Mother! The cast pulls it off again! Love love love the ducky tie!  :)
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I must admit, I love this series of books and the 20th trilogy is wonderful historical fiction overlaid on some pretty momentous events. But is it just me, or is Ken making these books ever more sexualized? Sometimes he's spending pages at a time on the sexual encounters of the characters. I guess it makes a nice counterpoint to the heavyweight history and nature of events, but I think he could probably do with a lesson in documenting these exploits in a way that integrates better with the flow of the book!.<br /><br />Still a great read.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Like the series. It is entertaining, interesting, has good actors/actresses and it is not too unrealistic.  I am not a fan of sci-fi, hence like these kind of action series
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning--frustrated at times. Not quite as good as some others, but better than 98% of the other books out there.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Lots of fun to play.  Not too difficult to figure out hoe to solve the mysteries and fairly long.  Worth the money and I would recommend to my friends!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This novel is an easy ready and keeps the reader's attention. It is very insightful and provides a glimpse of what covert military operations are all about.
B0053O89RY|5.0|This show is funny, light hearted, and a good watch.  I would recommend this show and the seasons to any TV watcher.
B0018RE7DU|3.0|I like Richard Geere he is a Spectacular actor.... But this movie is so, vaguely homo erotic its spooky.... I probably wont see it again.
0439023521|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and was immediately sad when I finished the book.  It kept me engaged and in the lives of the characters in the book.  I recommend.
B00284BNKC|5.0|There are drug movies, and then there is Requiem for a Dream. Great, Great, movie, Dont watch if you are a fan of rainbows and butterflys, but if you want a movie that will blow you away and STICK With you for weeks to come, then buy this, I had seen it before but I fugured it was worth another watch, and IT WAS!!!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This movie is a must have for anyone who loves Disney and animals.  My 2 year old can't get enough of the animals and is constantly &#34;roaring&#34;!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game. Its very easy to start playing and completely lose track of time. Its addictive!
B000J103YI|4.0|I bought this CD because I enjoyed the movie and the songs on it.  I find myself replaying certain songs but the whole CD is good.
B0009SOFFY|4.0|Given the raw and visceral sound of their debut, The Stooges had nowhere to go but up. Which is just what they did on their second album, \\"Fun House.\\" Suddenly The Stooges were showing that they were capable of playing more than just fuzz-toned psychedelic punks and were proving that they could handle their instruments. It's like they wanted the album to have a sound, even if the band still sounded wound up and frantic to get their point across. Given the rage that fueled the debut, this is quite the coming out party.<br /><br />It's not that The Stooges were in danger of being mistaken for a folk act. Iggy still howled, barked and grumbled like the wild child he was in those days, and the band wasn't beyond making an incoherent racket (the screamfest \\"LA Blues\\"). Here were riffs that were ready made to scream over, or as the liner notes describe, create instant mayhem. The opening cry of \\"TV Eye\\" (still an Iggy best of) is followed by a riff so primal that it makes you guess that Johnny Ramone got some of his earliest lessons from this album. Same with \\"1970,\\" the year after \\"1969\\" apperared on the first album.<br /><br />It was obvious that The Stooges were aiming higher, complete with a sax on the title track, another lengthy psych-out that has Iggy mirroring Jim Morrison. (The whole original side two is akin to the acid drenched rock of the time, less punky and more freaky.) For an album this manic, it's remarkably well produced by Don Gallucci. For comparison, listen to the into-the-red recording of \\"Raw Power.\\" Ron Ashton's guitar tears through the clutter with razor like clarity, and Iggy, who recorded his vocals live with a handheld microphone so he could make the livest recording possible, is all coiled energy, improvised shouts and hand claps.<br /><br />Nothing sounded like it then, and there's still little that matches it today. The debut may win the battle for better album just for its sheer audacity, but on \\"Fun House,\\" The Stooges - as Iggy sang on the title track - came to play.e title track - came to play.
B0007TKNII|5.0|If you enjoy musicals, you will like The Phantom of the Opera.  Great songs by a great composer and the singers in the movie can actually sing.  I recommend purchasing this movie!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Having both the black & white and color versions as well as the Maureen OHara commentary is so well worth the price. A great bargain and I'm looking forward to watching every year!!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|My husband and I started watching this show online and loved it immediately!  We are always laughing ... so we went to Amazon the next day and bought the season!
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I've watched this movie in its black & white version every year since I was 10. One of my very favorite holiday movies. Seeing the colorized version was a treat... If all this wasn't enough - having the cd of the movie's songs was icing on the cake!!
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Movies are generally cheaper online and in this case it was.  My husband loves this movie so it made for a good birthday present.  Recommend to anyone who likes comics/heros, etc ...
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I tried two other cases for my new Kindle Fire. Will be keeping this case for several reasons:<br />Slim profile<br />Elastic band to secure the cover<br />Lightweight<br /><br />Very pleased with the product at the very low price point.
B003TH2LA8|1.0|Because so many people seem to like this, I forced myself to watch the whole pilot, hoping against hope that the acting and the story would improve. No such luck. It is unnecessary to say that this has nothing in common with the novel it is supposedly based on. If it had, it would have at least a plot and dialogue beyond 'You are the seeker! You will save us from all evil!' *awed stare* slow motion fight scene *more awed stare* 'You ARE the seeker!' swoon... Was there anything I liked about it? The actors were pretty. If my disgust with the acting had not distracted me, I might have enjoyed this as much as an Axe ad.
1449410243|5.0|I loved the Oatmeal website, so of course I had to get the book! The new comics are adorable and the pullout poster is great! Awesome book!
B008BM0IUG|5.0|I have read other Kindle books and singles.  I have watched Youtube videos and lectures on Particle Physics.  This book presents the information in a way as to not treat us like the reader is  in Junior High.  But unlike the books that get very technical about super symmetries, it is very easy to read.  It is rare to find a book that has both of those qualities; Easy to follow and good/deep/technical information.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|this book was pretty 'tame' to my usual reads but it was easy,enjoyable and it had a good feel to it. IF you looking for something romantic, with an emotional  base that makes you smile and then ponder....buy it.....oh yeah....it was free....bonus!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show keeps getting better.  To put it into perspective, this is the only TV Series I've ever purchased.  I typically wait for Netflix but the Walking Dead is so intense that I absolutely must see it as new episodes are being released.
B000ICXQXI|3.0|Don't mind me, I am just one of those old time cranks. I've seen perhaps twenty Hitchcock films, and actually saw this one much later, which is ironic since Psycho is often claimed as his most &#34;famous&#34; work.<br /><br />This film is all-consumed on sheer suspense, but lacks the more important art of cinema which Hitchcock generally applied in his other works. Even he himself considered this movie a very &#34;tongue and cheek&#34; example of his style.<br /><br />I'd recommend the 1948 movie Rope if you're looking for fine Hitchcockian cinema.
B004VD3YIM|2.0|We had an original kindle fire. this app worked pretty well for awhile on there. then we had to replace due to a sound issue. Aged we got the new fire the app would lock the device up and we would have to do a hard shutdown. it never worked after that and we had multiple new devices sent to us. support from the app just said &quot;do not run on other devices&quot;. I have no idea what that means since this is an amazon approved app.  all subsequent attempts at support have gone unanswered.  Also the app people are constantly hitting you up for donations.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Fan of the franchise this movie tries to push too much content into too small slot. I really wish that could have been more plot development.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I was very excited to see another Kate Morton book, having read all her previous stories and loved them.<br />The Secret Keeper didn't disappoint - stories intertwined, twists and turns, characters that you loved and some not so much. I couldn't put it down.  I never read a book twice but after finishing this one, I felt that I could easily read it again.
1402786360|5.0|I couldn't believe the amount of tips and techniques shown in here. Must have cookbook for any skill level person. Great book!!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Be warned, you may be ordering counterfeit products from sellers through Amazon, even those who are fulfilled by Amazon.<br /><br />The counterfeit controllers appear to be a decent quality, but you should bear in mind that in the past fakes have stopped functioning, following firmware updates to the PS3, and there may be safety concerns over the rechargeable battery elements in the controller.<br /><br />It is hard to spot whether your controller is a fake, but look for these things:<br /><br />-  The serial number sticker on the back of the controller being misaligned, as if put on by hand<br />-  The misspelling of the word 'software' on the text on the reverse of the packaging.<br />-  The absence of an 'Official Licensed Product' sticker<br /><br />If you notice the above, then you should contact Amazon and voice your concerns.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Although there wasn't as much going on throughout this book, it was still an awesome Suzanne Collins master piece! I'm buying the final book, right now!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Loved it! Its so easy to use.You just click and drag.  Now I can showoff all my pictures. Instant photo album
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love this cd, it is my second-most-favorite music album. Her music is fun to listen to and also nice to play while doing homework. It appeals to a wide audience and everyone I've played it for has enjoyed it. I never liked to listen to music without words before, and this has shown me a new genre that I enjoy.
0786958731|5.0|I play this with my 3 and 4 year olds. It helps to train with taking turns and decision making. Albeit they do need help, they thoroughly enjoy playing it, and I enjoy playing it with them much more than typical preschool games. The minatures are well designed and the gamplay is easy to pick up. Cleanup is a pain, but having plastic baggies handy to seperate the different types of pieces makes this a bit easier.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love reading but have been in a reading slump lately. This book took me out of my slump. I couldn't put it down. The writing style is unique and humorous. I would recommend it to anyone - whether you are an avid reader or not.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the first book out of curiosity since it was such a huge hit.  I felt dirty and surely do not have any interest in reading the other books or anything else of this depraved nature.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I did not finish this book, not even close. I just couldn't get into it. HOWEVER, my book club LOVED it. My advice would be to try the sample before purchasing.
1401907725|5.0|These cards are so inspiring and right on!  I don't use them as often as I should but am very pleased when I do!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|If you like historical fiction, this is a very good, well-written book. However - it is very depressing and somewhat hard to read if you prefer &#34;light&#34; stories. Its an epic tale covering many decades, all on the same property. Very realistic for the time period.
B008PALH0E|5.0|We saw this live broadcast from Venezuela in a theater in Naples, FL in February 2012.<br />Was hoping it would come out in DVD. And here it is!<br />Wonderful to relive seeing it and enjoy it again and again.<br />Love seeing facial expressions and the excitement of the evening.<br />The children's chorus is amazing. Being front and center for 90 minutes and so well-behaved.<br />And cute, no less. Highly recommend this DVD.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I was glued to Sarah's Key, but a little disappointed in the ending.  After a while I began to loose interest in the connection between the characters.  The history is quite interesting as well as depressing.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Can't say enough about this movie! Great story, great courage, unexpected scenes. Had me laughing and crying, especially the crying part!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't understand any women who think this book was sexy.  This book is about a controlling, obsessive, abusive relationship.  That topic might be interesting to some people, but I would say that it is FAR from a turn on.  I was disappointed in Ana and I was disgusted by Christian.  I was over this book after the fallacio lesson.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|It often causes the Fire to freeze, and the constant updates annoy the kids like crazy.  Not like when we were kids...
B0041KVYIW|4.0|After receiving a copy that would make you seasick if you watched the tonearm rise and fall 3 times per revolution, a VG copy arrived. This is a wonderful remaster, Open and clean sounding is just the beginning. The bass response is superb. IMO this is the biggest improvement in the remasters. The bass level was increased, not dramatically so as to be in your face, but tight and not muddy sounding. This added bass makes these remasters, as it is present on all the remasters that I have bought.  The four star rating is for a few clicks and pops and the pressing being ever so slightly off center.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Kids and I are having a blast with it.  Love the graphics and music.  Can't wait for the updates to come!
0316077054|5.0|I love this series.<br /><br />I received a perfectly new book. I had no hassles at all.<br /><br />2 thumbs way up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|He's addicted, sadly, but it's far better than some of the other games out there.  He has a blast playing, and we often have to drag him away.  Thankfully, he at least made a room for &#34;me&#34;...
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|With all these actors, one would think this would be a good movie, but sadly it was bad.  The graphics were good, the tecnotronics were good, but the overall story was lack luster
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like Pinterest a lot, and think it's great...this is a good app to &#34;tap and go&#34; with.  I would suggest it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has a turn that I think no one expected! It kept my attention every minute! Congratulations ELJames, you did it again!
B009H442DG|5.0|It is obvious that they had fun making this wonderful CD. I Love it!  Since ALL of the proceeds go to charity, I recommend that everyone get into the holiday spirit and buy this CD!!!!
B008SVFX96|5.0|great album Rich! love it & the show was amazing! He has a fun side & soulful voice. we still listen to it everyday
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Good story, terse, buy main character John Corey wasn't a glib as in the past.  Writing was smooth and very readable
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Predictable, boring, stupid, crap.<br />The writers fill holes with nonsense, don't complete paths in the plot, solutions are contrite and so UN-scientific.<br />for example... picture yourself in the path of a giant bagel rolling toward you. Do you run along the path it's traveling? NO! you run away!! (ok, maybe a small spoiler). Even the alien history/biology/replication concept put forth in the aliens series is thrown to the wind. Only the special effects kept me from turning this off and they were not anything new.<br />Sorry, cannot recommend this at all.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|I loved this game for the PC, and the Kindle version is just as addictive. It's identical to the PC version. As for playability, this app reign supreme. I've gotten so many apps that were fun for the first 5 minutes and then the novelty wore off. Not so with this one. The price on this one is incredibly reasonable and worth every cent.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The best thing about office suit is its ability to sync with Google Drive... It also has a great layout.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great for entertaining and challenging your brain without having to work too hard. Great for all  my travels when I don't feel like reading.
B000ID1J5E|4.0|good movie, good action and suspense....meryl streep is great as usual....  she can whitewater raft with the best of them..
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|This book was not quite as entertaining as I had hoped. I love Tina, especially on 30 Rock, but this unorganized book was not what I expected.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. From start to finish I could not put it down. Gillian Flynn paints a haunting picture of the complexities of relationships and the demons that lie within all of us. Flynn creates characters that reflect traits inherent to all of us and it can be scary how close to real life this can be. Full of twists and turns, this is a great book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book. It reads so quick, the story is constantly moving from the start to the end. Ready for book two.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Excellant characters, and the story will become a clasic. I just a lot more of this story now:-)<br />thank you Anthony
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing I could not stop reading it. I started and then was hooked on it. Best book I've ever read
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Loved the writing, storyline, suspense on every page.  BUT!  The last few pages made me want to throw my Kindle across the room.  I was very disappointed in the ending.  I don't know what I expected but it left me flat.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|Like a lot of other XZ-1 owners, I got tired of taking the separate lens cap off to use the camera and putting it back on afterward.  I also worried that, when I had the camera in my pocket, the cap might come off and the lens could be scratched, although this never actually happened.<br /><br />A short time ago, I bought a \\"self closing\\" lens cap for a few dollars.  That cap had two problems:  (1) it was more than twice as thick as this Olympus cap, making the camera a tight fit in the pouch where I often carry it, and (2) its collapsible cover had three leaves, which stuck out beyond the lens when open.<br /><br />The Olympus LC-63A is less than half the thickness of the other cap I bought, so it fits both the case and my pocket.  The cover has four leaves, which can therefore be shorter and still fully cover the lens.  When the lens is open with the barrel extended, the leaves lie snugly against the lens barrel and do not protrude beyond it as the other cap did.<br /><br />Result:  I paid five times the price, but got a much better product.  It's easy to use: unscrew the old lens cap, throw it away, screw on the new cap.  Camera off = cover closed, camera on = cover open, all automatically!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a huge Vince Flynn - Mitch Rapp Series Fan - and this book doesn't disappoint.  I just hope the series keeps going and if they do make them into movies - which they definitely should - they don't miscast Mitch Rapp like they did with the Jack Reacher character.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and this is one of the best books in the series!
B004NELBPC|5.0|Great free app. My go to news source and it is all there for free. Just wish SF Chronicle was the same.  Hardly need my Ipad now given the size and ease of use of my Kindle.<br />Not sure why other reviewers said it was not free and that it wasn't the same content?  I compared it to my Ipad and all is there just maybe in a slightly different layout.  Thanks again Amazon! Did I mention I love my Kindle?
B000FC11A6|4.0|I tried reading this long novel last year and gave up about half way through the 1000 pages.<br /><br />I have restarted the book and am almost finished on my second attempt. It will take a lot of dedicated time to make it though this long novel.<br /><br />Neal Stephenson always does a very good job of writing an entertaining story. My favorite work is his Reamde book, but this Cryptonomicon story is much slower and less geeky that Reamde.<br /><br />Most everything in the story is described in painstaking detail, like the two pages spent on describing how one character eats breakfast cereal. The author spends all of his time describing the inane details of small plot points while sometimes leaving the reader to infer major plot shifts. The story quickly switches from modern characters and then back to WWII characters, which can be confusing if you aren't paying close attention.<br /><br />The seemingly simple story is fleshed out over about 1000 pages of detail that other writers leave to the reader to imagine. This is great in some cases and painful in others. This is why I only gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />If you like pages and pages of descriptions about cryptography and some historical descriptions of its use then you will like the story. If you want to stories short and don't like verbose story telling, skip this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Its true for most books but in this case I was,glad to have seen the movie first. Made the book a very easy read.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|A wrap-up for the season that keeps me coming back for more.  The use of &#34;You Only Live Twice&#34; at the end of the episode was particularly effective.  :-)
B0041D843M|4.0|This book is very well written & the evidence can not be ignored. I have become a vegan because of this book & could not be happier.  I have never felt better since I stopped eating animal products.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|While I did enjoy reading We Need to Talk About Kevin, it did have a few issues for me. When the author wrote about Kevin it was great! It seems like she got distracted while writing and has quite a few parts that do not help the plot. The writing style is confusing because it is a letter from Kevin's mother to Kevin's father...but then seems to slip into narrative with dialogue. So overall the parts where it's actually about Kevin I LOVED, I could not care less about the back story involving her being a tour book writer. I would suggest reading this book, but a lot can be skimmed over.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I don't think I could dislike a movie with both Russell Crow and Cate Blanchette.  I think they are two of the very best actors working today.<br />I am also something of a Robin Hood junkie.  But this Robin Hood is way above the rest.  The history is, of course, as mangled as every other Robin Hood movie.  However, the the historical world they created is just about perfect.  I am sure there are odds and ends that don't fit the time period. but nothing glaring (like clean floors).<br />Most of all, I love Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchette as Robin and Marion.  They both do their their magical hoodoo and turn into completely new people.  They have both suffered from the consequences of those terrible crusades that drained England of virtually all it's money and far too many of it's young men.  Then they  had to suffer under King John, who really was as bad as all the Robin Hood movies make him out to be - and maybe worse.  They struggle to survive and try to make a decent life for themselves and those who depend on them.  Their romance is funny as they work their way from initial wariness to a bond that is strong and even comfortable,<br />If you want Errol Flynn, watch Errol Flynn.  But if you want a glimpse into a past world and some great acting, this is your bet.  I loved it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Best &quot;hidden object&quot; game I've ever played. Engaging storyline &quot;Ghosts of Maple Creek&quot;  has it all. I keep coming back to the app store to see if the second one is out yet!
B009X01ELC|5.0|This cover is simple to use and very well designed. I can't even find anythinq to nit pick. Just be sure you line up the charging ports on the Kindle with the opening in the hard plastic case before you snap it into place. Then swivel the case 180 degrees counter clockwise and you're all set for landscape mode. For portrait mode swivel back 90 degrees
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|For some reason, the critics in the US did not think this was a worthy member of the Pixar line, and even claim it shows Pixar has lost its touch. It got far better reviews  in the UK.  In this case, the Brits got it right.  The look of the film is lush and lovely.  Merida is a feisty and independant coming-of-age-story heroine.  It's nice to see a story where the Princess does the rescuing instead of waiting mildly for the Prince to rescue her.  The little brothers make for great comic relief.  The story has excitement, tension, and a satisfying ending.  Lots of humor and heart.  A great family film.
B004DHUAZQ|3.0|The plot wasn't flimsy and drawn out. I was surprised by the lack of action throughout the whole movie, it left me wanting more.
B00A77II0U|5.0|this is the kind of game I like. it goes on and on. lots of help so you don't get stuck and can't continue. keeps changing...lots of fun!
B0078PC030|4.0|A great 80s kids classic that even now my 6 year old kids enjoyed after all these years. Wish they would digitally remaster it someday
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I purchased this app for my Kindle for the grandsons to play. The 5 year old spotted it a few days ago on my Kindle and could hardly put it down to go outside and play football. Knowing how much he loves football I would rate this game a 5 star.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This review is already on the Premium Edition, but I'm adding this on here since most aren't going to get the Premium Edition.<br /><br />So back when this game was announced, I didn't really think much of it...BUT HEY IT'S PERSONA!!!! So I wanted to wait to preorder the game until a month before the game came out. Then I saw an ad on Playstationlifestyle.com that there will be a Solid Gold Premium Edition coming out for the game...and only 10,000 will be made. That convinced me to preorder this as fast as possible. So I IMMEDIATELY go to Gamestop and preorder it. Turns out that the preorder of this item was sold out...in less that 2 hours all over the US. So happy that I got it. Anyways, that was my story on this amazing game. Now the review: With most of my reviews, I score based on graphics, story, music, gameplay, and this time, content (the stuff the game came with).<br /><br />Graphics: 4.5/5<br />This game basically is a HD remake of the super mega awesome PS2 version of this game. The characters and sprites are crisp looking. The background is amazing looking, and the colors are just right for this game. The only reason why I put this as a 4.5/5 is cause the movies in the game look a bit fuzzy, like they were taken straight from the PS2 version and not given an HD version like Zone of the Enders HD collection where the anime movies are very low quality.<br /><br />Story: 5/5<br />The story is basically a bunch of high schoolers saving people that are being tossed into the Midnight Channel. Sounds basic? Nah. What happens to the victims are pretty f-ed up and are a very powerful reason why the game is so good. All the main characters from the PS2 version are here, including a few more, like Marie. I won't tell you much about her, but you do meet her in the very beginning of the game.<br /><br />Music: 5/5<br />The composer, Shoji Meguro, is amazing. His choice of having rock with jazz-y parts in it make the game very enjoyable. My favorite song in the game isactually the first battle you get into, known as \\"Reach Out to the Truth.\\" It's SUPER catch-y and will make you wanna buy the soundtrack to listen to it a lot. (Note: the Persona 4 Arena version of this song is amazing!!!) Also, the singer, Reiko Tanaka, sounds awesome when singing!<br /><br />Gameplay: 4.5/5<br />Persona 4 Golden uses a lot of different genres in the game. Dungeon crawling RPG, dating sim, school life, and such. There are the infamous social links that you use to create better Personas in the game by having good relations with different characters (especially your partners like Yosuke, Yukiko and such.) You can only get into one relationship with one of the girls in this game (unlike Persona 3 where you can have relations with all the female characters...what a pimp!). The only reason why I gave this a 4.5/5 is cause personally, I'm not a fan of being rushed to things, especially with time management. Not my forte. You are on a very, very strict management with the game. Social Links with other characters, saving people on the Midnight Channel within a limited time limit (you only have a few days to a week to save the person), surviving school life, Persona management, and more within the game. But if this is your forte, then by all means! I have the original strategy guide from VersusBooks.com and it's helpful, but because there are new stuff in it, it's not as good as it was back then. Lastly, there is a nice little online feature. There are two types of them: The SOS, and the one where you get to see what other players around the world are picking as choices throughout the game. The SOS is basically having other players around the world help you if you are having trouble in a dungeon (I haven't used this yet as I'm in the end of Yukiko's Castle). The \\"choices\\" one isn't a bad idea to have, as it helps to see what the correct choice is to use in the game.<br /><br />Content: 4/5<br />Now, because only 10,000 of these were made, I rushed to get this game immediately and I wanted the contents so badly. There are a good amount of stuff in the box the game comes with. Here's the list of the items with a small explanation:<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden: the game itself, 'nuff said.<br />Hori® Hard Pouch: Sturdily crafted and stylishly customized, this case has a flap for storing PS Vita cards that also guards the screen. Useful if you don't have a case to put your cartridges in.<br />Hori® Face Cover: Offers lightweight yet effective protection without blocking any major ports, meaning you don't have to take it off to play!<br />Protective Skin: Adorns your PS Vita with the stylish, vibrant aesthetics of Persona 4 Golden and also includes 8 matching character wallpapers. This same skin is being offered in limited quantities as a bonus for fans who pre-order P4G at participating retailers.<br />Stickers: Featuring some of the popular stars of Persona 4, these stickers can be used to decorate anything you can think of!<br /><br />I took this info from ANN.com. Personally, this collection of items is great! The only thing? Because this is in such limited quantity...I don't want to use ANY of this stuff. Maybe the case cause I'm tired of the PS Official Cover Case that flaps open, but doesn't have any place for games or memory cards in it. But even then, I don't want to open it up from the plastic cover. When it comes to collector editions of many video games I own, I go all OCD on them and don't want to use them, but rather admire them. That's the real reason for the 4/5 stars. If this wasn't in such low quantity, a perfect 5/5.<br /><br />I've given this game a 5/5 just because I love the Persona series. I own almost all of the American releases (except the PSOne Persona 1, and the first Devil Summoner for the DS.) This is by far, the best Persona game there is out there, beating Persona 3 FES by a small margin cause there is more to offer in this game. You can get the Premium Edition on Amazon or eBay, but the bastards WILL over charge you by a lot, as it only cost $69.99. So, get the regular edition and play this game!
1601252463|5.0|Hi-ho, it's off to adventure we go!  My son refers to this constantly as he creates characters for his Pathfinder adventures. Pathfinder is a derivation of Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition. I got sick of the constant evolution of D&D into versions that strayed further and further from the original and that required buying whole new books every couple years. Pathfinder seems content to stick with the rules, and the rules they use work. Note, this book is not the whole game -- you will need to purchase the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook and the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary as well. I lead my son, daughter and their friends on wonderful adventures that are a nice break from computer games -- in other words, the kids interact with each other -- and me -- face to face for hours at a time.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|It was an entertaining romp through old school action stars.  Good for what it was, but only if you go in knowing what to expect.
B007R41E8O|5.0|fun to play. sometimes my phone freezes but not positive this app causes it. challenge to figure out the clues.
B00846REIS|5.0|Must read!  Highly recommend!!!  If you loved Fifty, you'll really, really, really like - if not love - this series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It is not appropriate for children under seventh grade though in my opinion, or unless your child is mature enough.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Highly recommend to Fifty Shades' fans.  Not only did I fall in love with Gideon but loved the female character, Eva.  She's a badass!
B000SUKPKM|5.0|I've always loved the Goo Goo Dolls, so obviously I love this album.  So much so that I actually bought 2 on accident, now my husband has a copy as well!
B00A77II0U|4.0|played this  game on the  kindle fire with no problems. fun hidden object adventure game. with an interesting storyline  too. thanks
B006C1DH92|1.0|This is a waste of money. It doesn't work. Starts to load then go back to home screen. Not good.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Love love love it!!!!!  Have read this book about six times and I just can't get enough.  Very addicting and well written.  When I have nothing else to do and nothing else brings me comfort this is my fallback.  Stephanie Meyer is the greatest.
B0088P2A7A|1.0|This will only work for a few minutes then it freezes up. Thought it would be really good for my son, now we just google it.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|My favorite  I watch the movie every year that stars George C. Scott to get into the CHRISTmas spirit . It does it for me!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|It went by too fast, before I knew it I had finished it!  Laugh out loud funny and I feel like I understand her much better.  Loved the references since we are the same age.
B00881PPTO|5.0|It provides a number of features that in the past I would need separate apps to do.  This will be my go to travel App.
0525952926|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my MIL and she enjoyed the book.  I have yet to borrow it to read, though plan to take a look at it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Characters are well cast. Stephen Amell walks a fine line in balancing the private and public sides of his alter ego, and showing the intensity of his hero identity.  The writing is surprisingly good, and the story arc (including back story), is unfolding at a slow enough pace to keep one anticipating more, but not so slowly one loses interest.  Willa Holland in particular, as younger sister Thea, is excellent.<br /><br />Batman meets Robin Hood - yes, it's not an original formula, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.  Highly watchable.
B008FWHGYS|1.0|The movie was quite confusing jumping from one thing to thenext, without quite finishing the first thing. It just really didn't make any sense . there was no point to the whole movie. I thought that with the stars in the movie:Anthony Hopkins, and The Constant Gardener chick, it would be great, great disappointment is what it was.
B008HK3RVY|5.0|feel very safe keeping my beloved kindle in this case. it butters my bread ans my bread shall butter it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have been playing this game almost every day since I got it as the FAOTD. It is not much more than a match 3 game but with some challenges unlike a standard match 3 game. The game has good graphics and a good music. It keeps me coming back to play and that is all that matters with any game. If you don't like match 3 games then this is not for you. If you do, then this is something  different. Right now it is the best game that I have on my device.
B008Y77O4G|5.0|love this beautiful piece of art. warms my heart in unimaginable ways. such a great motion picture. buy it. now.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|bought for my neices, they went to this movie with me and then i bought it as a gift .
B004DLPXAO|5.0|a lot to choose from.  Easy to use and setup.  Great selection and breakdown of categories. Works great on my daughters nabi 2.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|I don't like the feeling of having to get some obscure third party addon to watch my .avi movies.. This thing did it, but I quickly uninstalled because it just doesn't feel right. Afterwards, the ambition to watch my movies on my Kindle Fire HD died from there. Its just too much effort to get access to my movies in a clean and efficient way.<br /><br />Sure this app does the job, but it does it in a sloppy manner. The app crashed several times for me and the quality of the app overall wasn't to my liking. I like everything about my devices to be form fitting to the rest of the firmware on the device. This doesn't follow that at all.
0316066524|5.0|Hello I am still giving this book 5 stars up even though it has absolutely NOTHING to do with Harry Potter my cousin said this book is the unofficial sequel to the last Harry Potter books and it would tell about what the little wizard kids did when they go to Hogwash wizard school. I tried to read it but it doesn't even having anything about that. :( Please be warned do not listen to your family in this matter.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The only reason I downloaded the app was for the search feature. The other features in the app just kind of get in the way in my opinion.. The load up of each page also seems choppier and slower than the native doc viewer app on the kindle fire.
B004SIP8JI|5.0|I love the movie. I think Hugh and Meg work well together. I would recommend this to any Hugh Jackson fan.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the end all be all of note taking apps in my opinion. Not only does it sync all of my notes to my pc and other devices, it also does it in a very aesthetically pleasing way. The app is always using screen real estate to its fullest and the colors are amazing.There isn't much else to talk about but the UI because the app is centered around just the UI itself.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I love it, and want some more.  I watch two at a time. I am looking forward to Season ll.
B004N8CP8K|2.0|Would not let me remote into my desktop no matter how many firewall settings I changed. Faulty app or maybe bad config settings on my end? Either way its not worth it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a great movie, it tells you what the issue is with our country right now.  Its all starts with the family and it the responsibility of the father to keep that family together and motivated.  Great movie buy it for yourself and as a gift pass it around
B005HSL626|4.0|I played this for hours. The gameplay is seamless and on the Kindle Fire HD it is pretty awesome.. Especially going from my smaller phones screen to the tablet, it makes it easier for my clunky fingers to swipe dem fruits.
B0052GACNM|5.0|For anyone that knows music this is a performer that delivers.....Excellent !!! Every song was worth listening to and downloading to my MP-3...
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I enjoyed the whole hilarious aspect of Lincoln being a vampire slayer, although at points the story did drag on quite a bit. The ending I thought was actually perfect.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|I wish I had not ordered it. Too confusing. Hard to enter events and then retrieve them. There are other apps that are better...and free.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I love Flipboard. The interface is satisfying to scroll through when you want to look through all of the news stories, and they always seems to have the most interesting news articles on the front page!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|these birds keep getting angrier and angrier. my kids can not put this game down. fun fun fun fun fun.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|People now a days don't really thing playing a board game is the most fun.. Especially when they have to learn a new and complicated one. Cattan is kind of complicated and a little too complicated for some people to just dedicate themselves to in one session. That's why its one star knocked down because its not really a pick up game.. If I invite 2 new people to play with me, I will definitely win and destroy those two noobies.. There is no fun in that for me or them.<br /><br />With that said, if you are in a group of regulars who know how to play, this game is awesome. Its got just enough angles and randomness to make the game fair but also enough strategy to get satisfaction out of it.
0547884591|5.0|I loved this book for its common-sense but super-smart way of explaining things. The logical development of skills was powerful and the introduction of tools was progressive and purposeful. No more finding excuses to buy that cool looking gadget - all these have a purpose right away.<br />I have read the other books by this author and love the writing style.<br /><br />Buy this book if you want to learn anything, if you want to become a chef, or if you want to simply learn how to learn.<br /><br />Loved it. Will be looking for the next one!
0547884591|5.0|Tim is in a league of his own.  To be able to synthesize, execute and share all that information in such a digestible way is masterpiece.  Bravo!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I enjoyed this improbably story from start to finish.  So will you.  It is an impossible tale, told through a very implausible plot line, but so well related that I just kept reading and chuckling to myself.  I highly recommend this book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book with good research into the period.  I'm looking forward to the next one in the series.  I hope it is as good as this one.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is one of those addictive games like Angry Birds.  Once you start playing, you find yourself wanting to beat just &#34;one more level&#34; until hours have passed.
B00338QENI|5.0|I crossed paths with this book by chance on my new kindle after a brief mention of the HeLa cells in my microbiology course. I'm very glad I encountered it.. definitely a new appreciation for the cell line and a new perspective on cell biology.
0380807343|5.0|The book doesn't match the movie exactly but it is still a very good book. My daughter's book report earned her an &#34;A&#34;. A could also stand for Awesome read!
B009O5CLZY|4.0|This game is a fun play. It's very addictive.  Kids love the riding on animals and being able to be a yeti
B007SPPANM|5.0|How can you not love this movie? Yes, we know it doesn't end well. But the romance is so addictive you watch it over & over. I highly recommend this movie to all hopeless romantics everywhere!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|it didint let me download it on my kindel fire<br />stupid stupid stupid it it its stupid i i i cant believe this
B009VB97EY|5.0|I recommend this movie to all hot-blooded females 17+! Channing Tatum as Magic Mike proves to be one entertaining son of a gun! I knew he could dance from his debut of &#34;Step Up!&#34; I knew he was a good actor from &#34;The Vow&#34;. This movie has more than meets the eye; not just a stripper movie; it has romance, comedy, drama & of course it's sexy! Two thumbs up for sure!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Zero Day was typical Baldacci--lots of twists and turns and big surprises.  I am ready for his next effort.  Hopefully, in the not too far distant future, we will have a resurrection of Oliver Stone and his pals in the Camel Club.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I particularly ordered this DVD from Amazon Australia, for NZ & Australia & yet it won't play because it's the wrong region ! What's going on ? I'm definitely not happy - I've totally wasted my money !
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Very good story that I am sure will be watched many times.  Tim Allen does a great job as narrator.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I've always loved the show, sad that show  had to end but nevertheless glad that I bought it. Very fond memories

B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises was an epic conclusion to the greatest comic trilogy of all time. Christopher Nolan created an excellent follow up to the Dark Knight. It is definitely in a league of its own and I am not hear to compare the Joker to Bane or any other differences. Dark Knight and Rises are two completely different films with to completely different focuses. As an avid Batman fan the best way to sum of the trilogy is this. Batman Begins is about fear. Dark Knight is about chaos. and Rises is about pain. The most common complaint is that there are too many characters and the film is too long. However, all all the characters were necessary to wrap up the series of events that took place in the first two films. As far as length, the film was prone to be long (this is the last batman movie for at least 5 years) and we may not see Batman again any time soon especially if there is no Justice League film. The movie follows the comics well (and for those who are unsure check out Batman Year One, Batman: Dark Knight Returns on DVD and the comic books to get greater understanding) The bonus footage is great and this film was phenomenal. Avengers may have sold more but Rises was a better film and DC can say that they do have a superhero who can gross a billion worldwide by himself (Unlike Marvel) Batman is legendary and this is a fitting close for the greatest superhero trilogy of all time.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual Vince Flynn has given us a fast paced story that can,t be put down until finished.  It's a shame that his hero does not exist in real life!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I got a great deal for it on black friday, had to wait for it a little longer than usual but understandable during the holiday season.
B000YJ54DU|3.0|This was my last Reacher book to read (alas).  Unfortunately it was not the best closure to a fantastic series and homage to an outstanding hero.  All of Mr. Child's books have been riveting in that he weaves a tale not easily discernible.  The reader plows forward trying to find the thread that holds the plot together, but Mr. Child is too smart for me.  Regarding this specific book, I felt Mr. Child and Jack Reacher were off their game.  The villains were less villainous, the issue at stake less plausible and the ending less satisfying.  Yet in sincere appreciation to Mr. Child and his noteworthy protagonist, I have never spent so many wonderful hours reading about Reacher's exploits.  Thirteen books read and I not-so-patiently await Book 14.  Thank you Mr Child.
B003Y7AR4K|5.0|I love watching the Nutcracker no matter who put it on and wheter it is on stage or DVD.  This Nutcracker is my favorite because of the very talented Miyako Yoshida as the Sugar Plum Fairy.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I finished The Black Box last night.  I have read most Mr. Connelly's Bosch series and enjoyed them all.  Bosch is an irascible character and a fine detective.  In thinking about my favorites, I'd identify The Poet and Nine Dragons as standouts.  Mr. Connelly's knowledge of police procedure is &#34;spot on,&#34; and the interplay between Harry, his daughter, the women in his life , his partners and bosses help layer the Bosch series with added legitimacy.  I always buy Mr. Connelly's book.  Try one.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Would somebody please put Damon Lindelof on the same Banned-For-Life list as M. Night Shama-lama-ding-dong please? Thank you Sir Scott for completely ruining Alien for me now. If you value the original, do not watch this piece of garbage.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I've read one other book by Mr. Flynn featuring Mitch Rapp.  I do not recall the name, but I liked that one better than The Last Man.  My main criticism of Rapp is his lack of humanness.  He is brutal, obsessive and not very likeable.  My heroes need some worthy vulnerability.  Rage doesn't cut it for me.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is awesome.  I haven't been able to say that about most of the games I've played.  I hope Alawar continues to come out with more of this type of game.  It held my interest all the way through and stumped me on several occassions.  Graphics are superb and the story line is more than creepy.
B003ES61EE|5.0|Just as good as any of the other more expensive models of this product.  Cleans my lens nicely every time!
0385737955|4.0|The setting is in a place called the Glade. None of the boys has any memory of his old life; they don't remember any details about themselves except their names. The boys have made a life for themselves in this place, and their only hope is trying to solve the maze that surrounds the walls. The Maze is a dangerous place, filled with terrifying half monsters and half machine, Grievers, who exist solely to sting the boys with a deadly poison. The plot is mysterious and full of surprises. I constantly found myself wondering how the boys got there, whether they would be able to get out, and what will happen to them.<br /><br />It's cool how all of the Gladers formed a society to survive the everyday fear of not knowing why they are there or how they can possibly get out. Then, with Thomas's arrival, things begin to change. He is determined to discover the solve the secrets to the maze and goes to great lengths to find the way out. He gives the boys hope. Even with no answers, he unites the boys, and they keep working together to find a way out.<br /><br />What made it hard to start the book is the slang. Dashner uses unique words, like klunk, greenie, shuck, slopper, and all sorts of other words, which were confusing at first. It's just like the feeling I got with Thomas at first. He is confused and doesn't understand what Dashner is saying. Thomas is an easily relatable character. The way that Dashner portrays him makes it easy to feel his emotions and identify yourself with him.<br /><br />It is through unexpected intervention that Thomas remembers the solution to the maze and why the boys have never been able to get out. The ending was very suspenseful, and I look forward to further adventures with this bunch!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The author did a very good job of blending the old with the new for a really good mystery.  You like the characters and want them to suceed
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire held its own in comparison with its predecessor. The pace of the story was initially a shock from the cliffhangers and action that concluded the previous book, but the unfolding of events allowed for a natural, engaging continuation.<br /><br />The story begins in District 12 where Katniss and Peeta are preparing to tour the 13 districts and Capitol City to celebrate their victory at the Hunger Games. There is an element of wariness and disdain about the whole process. Katniss is being pressured by President Snow, who sees her past actions in the arena as subtle rebelliousness. Katniss wants to protect her family by doing as Snow says. However, from the beginning, the reader gets the sense that Snow is not to be trusted and that things will not go according to plan. Throughout the book, the plot progresses very quickly and there are multiple instances where some events are merely skimmed over<br /><br />The one area in which Catching Fire exceeds its predecessor is the ending. A surprise twist followed by a cliffhanger was the perfect way to keep readers rabid for more. By the end of this book, it is easy to be curious about what Katniss' fate will be.<br /><br />In short, Catching Fire was a page-turning follow-up to an extraordinary novel. As with any good series, you have to ready the next book to enjoy the whole series and I expect the final book, \\"Mockingjay\\" to be a good finale.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|This is my children's favorite Holiday movie! I even love it myself.  We watch this frequently during the holiday season. Cute movie and great quality!
0545425115|5.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before--and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that will weigh survival against humanity and life against love.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />In this book, Ms. Collins built a fantastical and believable world where the United States is no more and instead the country is now called Panem which is run from \\"The Capital\\" and divided into 12 districts. The story progresses quickly and fluently with well defined characters who have lame names.<br />The author's style is great. Ms. Collins' prose is efficient in a no-nonsense style filled with humor which causes the book to become addictive. Like any good story, you are immersed in the universe built around you, yet you know it is not real but you can't stop reading.<br /><br />WARNING:<br /><br />The premise for this trilogy is pretty disturbing. It's kids killing kids in a `fight to the death' tournament. But as disturbing as it sounds, the author did a good job of not overwhelming the reader with blood, guts, and gore. The shock value is that this, the actual Hunger Games itself, is considered to be a form of `entertainment' for the people in the Capitol.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like to put stuff from other sites my grand kid's can put the pitches they take of the games they. play and the pitchers that they make on one of the painting games thank you
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Great musical. Will be enjoyed for years. Would highly recommend it to anyone who likes good family entertainment. Great price.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of Flynn's books and they are awesome.<br />Read them in order though since the main character is the same.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. It's the best thing he's written since finishing 'The Dark Tower' series.<br /><br />It's long, but read it. You won't regret it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've never had issues with this app. It always works great. It comes in handy when I'm passing the time at the doctor's office or something.
0446310786|5.0|Just re-read this book for the second time. I love this book. I LOVE this book. This time around I really found that Lee was reminiscent of Mark Twain. It makes me think of growing up and summertimes in north west Florida.<br /><br />I'm bumping it up a star. It was a great reminder of what I started law school for.<br /><br />25 Jun 2009<br />I shockingly had never read this before. I picked it up because it was recommened as so-called 'legal fiction', and while I probably would fail to categorize it that way, it's still an amazingly elegant and brilliant book.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Too much of the same.  Plot is very thin. Hopefully Book 2 will expand the plot line and personalities .
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|First, let me say - I hate the cover of this book. Although I LOVE Tina Fey I couldn't bring myself to read it because the cover creeps me out so much. That being said -- this book is fantastic. Honestly, it's like watching her talk on '30 Rock'. She's smart, she's funny, she's a feminist, and best of all, she '... doesn't give a f*** what you think.' [about her]<br /><br />Exceptional book, especially for a memoir which seem to be a dime a doze these days.<br /><br />Read it. Now
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|The violence between heroine Merida's parents (father trying to kill mother) is deeply disturbing. The heroine is a skilled archer who saves the day by sewing. Her desire to be treated as a person rather than an object is \\"selfish\\". Wanted to like this movie but couldn't...not a story I want my daughter to learn.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Enchanting. The first word that comes to mind. Charming is the second. This is a great read. I love that the setting is as much of a character as the characters themselves.<br /><br />Good read.
B009T3AHDE|1.0|The number of adult viewers that left the cinema at the 42nd street AMC in NYC during this film was unprecedented. At least 25% of the audience by the film's end.<br />Need I say more?<br />Cronenberg is great.<br />Material wasn't worth the film it was printed on.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|** spoiler alert ** Three and a half stars, really. I think that ending the series at the first novella would have been much more satisfying in a way.<br /><br />I don't often write spoiler reviews, but this is different. The ending of the first novella is so final, so perfect in the way a short story should end, I really think that the author messed up in turning it into a hopeful, happy-go-lucky ending that finishes the fifth novella.<br /><br />Overall - extraordinarily entertaining, but nothing deep or important.<br /><br />EDIT: I also want to add that this book IS easy to get immersed in and the author does characters very, very well. Which is no small feat.
B000SW4DXK|4.0|love- love- love this movie.  its great for all ages and holiday fun.  however when i rented it i had some issues steaming it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Fun. Best 'haunted car' story since 'Christine'. Ending left me feeling unfulfilled, a neat wrap up isn't always required, but the end of this just felt too abrupt.
1401322786|4.0|Mitch Albom, known for \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" and \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\", once again shows his ability to craft spartan writing to tell a hugely emotional story in a very simple manner.<br /><br />The story of Dor, the inventor of timekeeping, bookcases the stories of Sarah and Victor, two people that for very different reasons find themselves dealing with the issue of time.  Not having enough, waiting for it to speed up, slow down, it all lends itself in the story to ask and answer the question: what is the MEANING of time?<br /><br />Mitch writes in a direct manner, and he still manages to create tense emotional moments throughout the book.  I personally felt great attachment to Dor, and his story of love lost is truly compelling.  Sarah and Victor's stories will also be compelling to many others based on each reader's personal backstory, but you can be sure that this book will reach you, will make you question the relationships we have with loved ones and will change the way we spend our time.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to reach out and get this book.  You will thank yourself for the time you spend with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I took me awhile to get to this book. But true to form - there's a time for every book, and when the time for this one came, I only wished it had been sooner.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is a damned genius. She's only written three books but they're all fabulous.<br /><br />I hate the next eight words but:<br /><br />I don't want to ruin it for you.<br /><br />Read it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this story. The pace picks up later in the book and it begins to dawn on you that there is much<br />More to this story than at first thought.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. My one complaint with it, which may be due to the fact that I'm not the key demographic, is the protagonist's constant wonder, worry, and complete and total insecurity. Maybe I just don't remember what it's like to be seventeen. :)<br /><br />What I loved about this book is the way the author captures that heart-fluttering, anxiety-ridden, can'tsleepcan'teatcan'tthink about anything but your first love. THAT, I remember.<br /><br />Excellent read. Long, but easy.
B00633W614|3.0|Truthfully....I expect more from Archer.  This second book in the trilogy (?) felt rushed and shows a lack of development.  It was okay but not at all what I expected, from this storyline and this author.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|Another win for Stephen King! I know I'm twenty-odd years late in saying that, but hey, there's a time and a place for every book, and 'It's time was now.<br /><br />Great rendering of childhood nostalgia -- even if I didn't grow up in the late 50's. This is the first time in a long time that a book has actually frightened me a little bit. I like to read in the bath, but after the scene in Beverly's bathroom -- I actually had second thoughts.<br /><br />Fantastic fantastic. Long but completely worth it.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|Archer ever delivers a rollicking good read and this is no exception to that rule of thumb. A retelling of Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo, the sole reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it is not 'quite' as good as the original. But what could be? Interesting characters, excellent plotline and development.....it delivers!
B004LROUW2|3.0|Whew. I had to give this book three stars because it was SO. LONG. I have no issues with long books - but this just went on and on and on. Much of it could have been taken out. By the end of the book I didn't care about what happened to who or why. Which was what was so enjoyable about the beginning of the book.<br /><br />This book is extremely cerebral. It requires effort (which again, is fine in and of itself) to put all the pieces together. Still we are left with loose strings, what happened to Fuka-Eri? Doctrines of Sakigate? The dowager? Tamatsu? In most pieces I would find the lack of an 'ending' (in regards to the loose ends) satisfying and mysterious in a good way - in this novel, it's just frustrating.<br /><br />All that said, this novel is EXTREMELY well written - as far as style, syntax, and character development. The name dropping of famous literary works and authors is nice, along with drops of classical music.<br /><br />Perhaps wait for an abridged version and go with that?
B005USZYDU|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but the ending left me hanging. I feel he could have had better closure. Worth the read.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Compelling. Very enjoyable. Still, in the long run it turns into fluff. Not that it's a bad thing.<br /><br />Good airplane/beach reading.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Very intuitive puzzle game...shouldn't take longer than a few days of in and off playing to finish.  Graphics and SFX are well done.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I absolutely loved these books. After reading Hunger Games I read every dystopian book & series I could find. I read Divergent/Insurgent first, Legend, the Throne of Glass/novellas, The Scourge, Under the Never Sky, Delirium/Pandemonium, Matched/Crossed, Eve/Once, Enclave/Outpost, Graceling/Bitterblue/Fire, I was tearing through them all. I put off reading these books for so long because I thought a story about a bunch of vain people would be dull & wouldn't be for me. I was so wrong. You really don't get an idea of the Uglies world from the summary. The books were so exciting, and the world that was painted was creative, imaginative, and everything else you want of a good dystopian. The characters are rich and original as well. Tally Youngblood isn't very likeable at first, but as she changes your love for her grows leaps & bounds. I'm glad the lack of other options finally made me read this saga, as it turned out to be hands down in the group with my other favorites!
B009CPES4I|5.0|A touching story and relevant to anyone 50+.  Beautiful photography and a sense of wonder as they travel to India.
030758836X|3.0|For the amount of time I invested in getting to know these characters, the ending left me wondering if the writer wasn't under some sort of deadline. The last few diary entries were so flimsy, so predictable, I felt let down at the end of this story.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Free is nice but not when you have to tolerate advertising. Deleted and don't bother to even load this, plus the GUI isn' the best.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I'm so addicted to this show, it leaves me on the edge of my seat every week (the first season was a 5 star show).
B000N649I0|5.0|What can I say? I bought a used copy of this LP just to have one. It was Tom's first album on Asylum records in 1973. There are at least 7 or 8 classics out of a dozen tunes. His songwriting skills were very much apparent back then and carry on to this day. I just pray he comes back to the Twin Cities someday.
B000MRA5NS|2.0|blue ray quality is fair, however it does support all major subtitles languages, missing spanish and other major such a s french
B004EIZCPM|5.0|This was a laugh out loud movie.  I loved it!  We watched it on a plane flight to Mexico on my Kindle Fire.  I recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The juxtaposition of the two stories grabbed and held my interest throughout the book.  Once I was done, I passed it along to my wife and she thoroughly enjoyed it as well.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This was really good.  I had been to the movie a week or so before I received the book and the movie was good but a little hard to follow.  The book however was not, it was a very good read although a lot different than most of the books I have read.  I tell my friends that the movie is a little hard to understand and they might not like it, on the other hand I highly recommend the book.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I was not expecting much from this album but, wow was I wrong. Every song is so well written and performed. Definitely worth it, you will not regret getting this album.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Yes, another Baldacci winner. He is rapidly becoming my favorite author.  If you like his works you might like his new one &#34;<br />The Forgotten&#34; I have just started it and am turning the pages as fast as I can.  Another good one.
B0098VXN2Y|2.0|My wife suggested this movie since we are expecting in February 2013. We were both disappointed with the plot and the overall production of the film. There were a few funny moments, but they certainly do not warrant the purchase of this movie. If you are even considering watching it, wait until it comes to Prime.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Yep, this one is different.  I guess it is a philosophy put forth by the author, if you are into that sort of thing it might be better.  I just thought it was strange.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I HAVEN'T READ MANY OF NELSON DEMILLE BOOKS SO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS ONE.  BOY, WAS I SURPRISED!!!!!  THIS BOOK WAS GREAT!  NOT ONLY LOTS OF ACTION BUT SEVERAL LAUGH-OUT-LOUD MOMENTS.  JOHN COREY IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH JACK REACHER AND HARRY BOSCH.<br /><br />BUT-----I HAVE TO ADMIT THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS WERE A LITTLE TOO &#34;RAMBOISH&#34; FOR ME - A LITTLE FARFETCHED.<br /><br />I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.  LOVED IT!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a MUST!  It appeals to everyone who just loves a great read.  Its the kind of book that you cant wait till bedtime to see what the characters are up too. It refreshing and different than anything else out there.  If I may suggest, read the authors own question and answer section in the back, it was flipping hilarious!!!!<br /><br />Also this book would be appropriate for many young adult readers as well.  Violence was minimal, and no crazy erotic scenes.  This is a great Saga book, I put it right up there with Dune!
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The dialog is extremely corny and the plot is so predictable it is laughable.  It is more a farce than an action flick.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Boom, Bang, Blow em up.  This movie might have some bad acting but I think the crew made up for it in fight scenes and special effects.  Not the best but worth a rental on a slow weekend.
B007HOOAH6|4.0|I got this for my 2yr old grandson so he will start to think about going potty in an actual potty.  He asks for this book several times a day, and is very interested in what the child is doing.  We'll get him a potty chair soon and start the process.
B009GX69RK|5.0|One of my favorite shows to kill a half hour.  Great cast.  IF you liked Community you are going to love New Girl.  Streaming was flawless.
B00ADYYY50|2.0|i really thought this album was going to be a game changer. boy was i wrong. i feel like this is a boring album. i only enjoyed a few songs such as medicated and the plan. rolling papers had a couple songs i love and still listen to on a regular basis (when i'm gone & cameras). this album could have been so much more. all the hype and the push backs for such an average album
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I was waiting for this movie to come out to rent.  Even with the anticipation Lawless did not disappoint. The plot and acting was pretty good but I was waiting for Shia LaBeouf to become a bad*** and take over the movie.  He never completely fulfilled that roll and I was a little disappointed.  Still a great rental.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in four days. Couldn't put it down! If you can't handle graphic sex scenes then this book isn't for you .However, if you can then this is a great read. Love the story, love the characters!
0316017930|4.0|I rated it 4 stars becauseit was well written and obviously thoroughly researched. The overall message, however is not that esoteric or secret.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. I couldn't  wait to read more about the characters. Sex scenes are quite graphic but that easy to get passed
B00000IL26|4.0|I think the recipient will be pleased with his gift. I recieved notification that it shipped very quickly! I like the abilty to include a message for free.
B00846REIS|4.0|I first heard about this book in a magazine. I loved the Fifty Shades of Grey series so I was excited to find another one that was similiar to those. So when I first read reviews of this book (which I think went into way too much detail) I decided not to because alot of them said that this book was way too much like Fifty. Then I read the review for the second book in this series and decided to give them a try. I loved them! I think the story line is completely different than Fifty. Yes there are some similiarities but not so many that they can't be overlooked. Read this one to get to the second, which is better!
B0086700CM|4.0|My son loves it, and it keeps him occupied when I need him to be still. That's why I bought it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this one the most our of the series. I think the story line was wrapped up in a really good way
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is a perfect app with plenty of game variety.  I'm trying now to unlock all the other games....but so far the games are entertaining and addictive.
B009GEPPYC|5.0|If you have ever seen it on broadway its just as great on screen. I felt the passion, the comedy and the music. Tom cruise impressed me with the performances. Lots if big stars and they do it justice ad normally movies with too much star power in my opinion are so over loaded the you aren't able to catch on. One to own for sure.
B009SCRERI|5.0|Another great Disney movie. It touched my heart the bond that siblings should have illustrated in a very humble way.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|I haven't laughed so hard in a long time I actually thought that nikki and Drake would drag it but they were good. The lesson was perseverance and never giving up.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|What if this story were true...and most people will deem me crazy...but the storyline was pure perfection and if you weren't there it is a hard one to dispute. A great example is the Di Vinci code.. where all the pieces fall together. It makes you think Lincoln was even greater than the man we know. It's a must see, must own and must watch over and over again.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|OMG!!!!!!!! I love Ke$ha's new album Warrior. She's officially back with her sophomore album. I did get the Target exclusive edition with the t-shirt. It's awesome! I just listened to it since today on my ipod. My favorite songs are on the album Die Young, C'mon, Warrior, Crazy Kids, Thinking of You, Dirty Love (with Iggy Pop), All That Matters (the Beautiful Life), Wonderland, Love Into the Light. Supernatural, Gold Trans Am, & Past Lives. I like Ke$ha, when she came out with her debut album Animal back in 2010. I liked her ever since the beginning of her music career. Listen to her new album. It's the best album!
0143034901|4.0|I was in awe of the language and setting of this book and it made me appreciate my love for reading more than ever.
0865479186|4.0|This was a very good book that I did not like.  The author clearly knows what he's talking about.  Unfortunately, sometimes it's hard for the reader to know what he's talking about.  In a bold effort to make scientific skepticism accessible to the everyday reader, Goldacre buries the gems in a pile of confusing statistics, all valid statistics backing up his insightful, important claims to show he's done the research and knows what he's talking about, but muddling statistics.  I wish he'd stuck the statistics in appendices.  I am excited to learn more about him through his blog, as I loved his insights and would prefer them in lower doses, so to speak.
0553801473|5.0|This book arrived right on schedule. It was in perfect conditions. About the book. I've only gone through the first 100 pages. It started slow, but it seems like it will pick up any moment.
B0058SN2C2|5.0|i got this after having the malindi a few yrs which i hated the fit, the sling was loose and was flimsy, this fits much better ,im really happy with it!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved this movie, the action is ridiculous and the story is really good. When the Hulk hits the screen, watch out!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is back! Fast paced, and believable. This is a great book reflecting the complex times in which we live. No one does this genre better than Flynn.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|its basic. need mouse and keyboard on ur ps3? grab this basic item. simple, and meh usable. not good as pc but its whatever. But i will say it works 100% better than other mouse and keyboard devices.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Read this book! You won't regret it. I can't wait until the next book comes out! March, I think? Oh well.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a huge fan of Vince Flynn and this book is one of his best. His stories sound like they are right out of today's news.
B007HACDLK|5.0|All the Mitch Rapp books are intense, so hard to put down once started, and The Last Man is no exception.<br />Fast paced, hooked to current events, it has it all.  I really enjoyed the way Flynn has created new avenues for<br />Mitch Rapp, definitely giving his character room for emotional growth, something that was very necessary given his<br />personal and professional history. Anyone who is a faithful fan will enjoy last man to the very last page!
B008602KQI|5.0|I am a big fan of &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; so of course i love this. While I was not thrilled about some of the adaptations the movie made from the books, I think the film is true to the spirit of the books. Plus, knowing that Suzanne Collins had a hand in the screenplay makes me feel, if the changes were ok with her, they're ok with me. A fantastic film, and a great purchase. The 2-disk DVD comes with some great extras, and I am so thankful for the digital copy that came along with it so I can play the movie from my Kindle or phone when I'm away too.
B001I13PM0|5.0|Everything Yanni produces is excellent ! He has the uniqueness of an uplifting and soothing sound to instrumental and vocal music.  His concerts are world-class.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app functions fine on my original Kindle Fire but with my new Fire HD 8.9 it only loads the first several posts in the news feed and refuses to load any more.
0880796863|4.0|the person I bought this for seems to like it, can't ask for much more. She wanted a set of tarot cards that were compact and that explained the details of them to teach her their meanings- it is all of that.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is great TV. The plot is rich and provides enough twists and turns to keep ones attention.<br /><br />The characters are entertaining and the written is witty.
B0001GMIOE|3.0|I purchased an exact replacement for my Canon Rebel original battery, which had lasted several years.  For the first year this replacement behaved like a new battery.  Unfortunately then it began to fail just after one year of use.  At first I thought I hadn't charged it correctly/completely, but in its second year of use it became obvious the battery has continued to fail.  Two years after purchasing this battery, it holds a full charge for only a couple days, and allows about 10 - 20 minutes of use.  If I try to use the camera three days after a full battery charge, the camera only works for about 5 minutes until the battery is completely drained.<br /><br />Recently the battery failed during a portrait session with a willing kitty, and I missed some good shots.  I have been getting requests to do portraits and am considering starting a side business.  For this I need a reliable battery and also a back-up camera.  I don't know if the battery I ordered was defective or had been used, but from now on I would rather purchase something like this from a camera store.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I bumped from 3 to 4 stars simply because this movie includes all the action heroes from movies past.  It's not a typical action movie.  It is a venue for a lot of our elder action statesmen to get back into our memories.  A lot of shooting and blowing things up by our old favorites.  This movie is definitely different and not necessarily in a bad way.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was a great book. definitely reminded me if the 50 shades series. Worth the time to read. loved it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second book of the series.  Bought the first book and did not expect to like it but I did and ordered the second book.  Continues the story very well.  Will also buy the third book
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I bought this for my 5 yr. old grandson.  He loved the music and color and of course, the angry birds.
0345473035|5.0|When my son was four months old, a friend recommended Tracy's book The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems for us to learn how to deal with the frustration of his difficult sleeping. Following her technique in that book saved me and my wife from going insane.<br /><br />Now that my son is two, he's presenting a whole new set of challenges, particularly that we are not really sure how to properly discipline him so he learns good lessons. I decided this time I needed to dive in and read this book cover-to-cover, and I'm so glad I did. In a very short time I feel like I understand my son so much better, and as a result, I have far more patience with him and handle his outbursts more maturely. As a result, he is better behaved and doesn't need to be disciplined as often! Talk about a win.<br /><br />A lot of the advice in this book boils down to recognizing who your child is, respecting his or her personality, setting good boundaries and limits, and teaching self-control. Sounds simple, right? Well, it is, but it's not always easy to know how to do these things properly, and sometimes the concepts run counter to what any individual parent may be naturally inclined to do.<br /><br />I recommend all of Tracy's books for parents of infants or young children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is a wonderful game but when is the next upgrade comming I mean I love it but it really needs an upgrade
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book not only  met my expectations, but exceeded them as well.  It is a heartfelt, romantic, very well written novel I would highly recommend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|There are only hundreds of thousands of reviews of these books, it's been talked about by everyone, so what more is there to say?  If you have been living in a black hole somewhere and have not heard or read these books yet, step into the light and find your delight. :-)
B00846REIS|5.0|The Crossfire series is definitely worth the cost to purchase.  My only regret is that I wish I had waited until all the books were available prior to purchasing.  I personally hate having months in between, but otherwise I would definitely recommend this series.

B0018LX9T4|5.0|The video quality is great, shipping time was very quick. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has an interest in that type of activity.
B009AP2G26|4.0|No, you will not find cars flipping and bursting into flame or high-speed chases, but Glee zings and sings quickly. As the cast of characters grows and as obligations to feature each one become complex, the story line is brief, more like a quick segue between big musical production numbers. If you've ever taken your wee ones to a performance of Sesame Street Live or even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (I'm several decades old, okay?), then you know what I mean: the story is thin in order to bring along the music, dance, and applause. I still watch. I still care about these kids, but the narrative may well be lost and forgotten completely in 2013.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have been a Rod Stewart fan for 46+ years and so happy he came out with a christmas album. I started playing it the day I got it and listen to it everyday.
1449415881|5.0|bought as a gift for my son and his girlfriend who are Dilbert strip admirers; they really enjoyed it which made me happy
0307279189|5.0|I love this book!  I am using it for a few of my classes and the students like it as well.  It is not just about running.  It is about running, but it is also about history, mythology, ancient tribes, science, ultra running, and other things.  I highly recommend it!
B0096BIENY|5.0|I haven't received The Greatest Hits yet, but have been listening to \\"I Will Always Love You\\" on YouTube. I thought nobody could do it better than Whitney. These guys consistently amaze me and just blow me away. Their music really transports me out of this world and into some happier, more beautiful place.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I just signed up for showtime a week before the first season started and have watched every episode since! I bought this disc set to let my friends get caught up and now they're all hooked.
B004XUMNZ8|3.0|I must take issue with the Amazon description of one character's dalliance with Oswald Mosley and his fascist New Party as \\"right wing activities\\".  Oswald Mosley was a member of the Labour Party and was an avowed 'Lefty' and member of the Socialist Fabian Society.  The conflict between fascists and communists in pre-WWII England was really a squabble among the various factions of the British LEFT wing.  Try to remember that fascism during Hitler's rise was essentially 'bossy socialism' with all the assorted accoutrements of history's other left wing totalitarian movements like controlled economies and autocratic rule.<br /><br />The constant re-writing of history in the media is disturbing and guarantees we will repeat the same mistakes.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Great show, highly recommend it to people that are fans of superman based off of superman's  teenage years  in smallville
B004TMPJP6|4.0|This app is easy to use and allows quick management of multiple lists across multiple devices.  Only has 2 levels of priority, though (starred or not starred), and those only rate the task within that list.  I have to scroll over multiple lists on a busy day to see what I need to do next.
B007EECSFA|1.0|This book is so hard to read.  Very boring and confusing.  Not interesting at all.  Wish I had never bought it.  Did not finish.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I'm not a big fan of bluegrass, however, this group does it right.  Definately American roots music.  Nice mix of fast pickin' and slow ballads.
0425263916|5.0|bought it for the wife and she loves her books, she read it in 2 days. can not wait for the next one
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Reading this book is great I have a hard time putting it down.nelson Demille is a good story teller in this book about the panther
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower was such a genuine read. I laughed and cried. I couldn't help but adore this boy. Charlie is a character like no other. He was a sweet boy coping with a very difficult past and trying to make it through high his school years. I‘m afraid Charlie would've ended up like Michael if Sam & Patrick hadn't came into the picture. I loved this book. Friendships like Patrick, Sam, and Charlie's are very rare. A story like this is rare. Once again, I loved it. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a touching, honest story. Kind of sad it is over though: (
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland--Season 1 is innovative and unique.  Very well done and engrossing.  Claire Danes, Damien Lewis, Mandy Patinkin--as usual, beyond first rate.
B0094WU3WU|1.0|Having read Pride and Prejudice, I expected this to have a plot of sorts but not be 'unputdownable' as other books I've read are. This book was horrific in it's 'plot' and pacing. If you need a way to get to sleep, go ahead and read this. It's right up there with my old psychology textbook.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Something was missing in this one. They tried to be so cute using all the cliche cameo catch-phrases that it didn't jive very well. And I thought they would make more use of all the star power but Chuck Norris and Arnold barely were on the screen it seemed. Just didn't enjoy this one as much as the first one. There wasn't as much banter between they guys either.
B004KU832S|5.0|It's hard to find an actual passenger train that'll fit on Brio/Melissa&Doug/Thomas tracks!  The station is very sweet and the details are charming.  Very good quality.  We did end up taking out the batteries of the engine -- loved the lights, but the sound got tiresome.  Too bad the lights and sounds run on the same battery.
B007Y1AINC|5.0|I only recently discovered Keane, around the middle of this year. I started with downloading HAF and there's not a song on the album I don't like. I'm surprised that many people compare them to Coldplay - I love them too but Keane has a very different sound. I thought Under the Iron Sea was brilliant, and it brought out Tom's vocal talent even more. Perfect Symmetry and Night Train were very different from anything else previously released, but I must say, most of the songs grew on me and I added those to my collection.<br /><br />Now we have Strangeland, and I was really excited to see what Keane would do next. I don't know what I expected, maybe another Hopes and Fears that I loved so much? These songs seem more sophisticated than anything on HAF, and they didn't connect with me at first. However, upon listening to them more and more, I was impressed with the deeper meaning in these songs and I was moved by most of them. I again feel that there's not a  single bad song on this album.<br /><br />I don't know how Keane does it, but it's amazing how they show such dramatic progression in every album. The lyrics are more grown up and concentrate on life's changes, which everyone can relate to. Keane is a band that stands all on their own, and I'll always be such a huge fan.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Do not buy this product.  Do not rent this product.  If you like watching OLD video tapes.  The kind they made in the '80s, you will be happy with the picture quality.  It's that bad.  They put 3-4 hours of material on each SINGLE LAYER DISC. For those of you who do not know what this means, think of the best possible picture you can get from a dvd and then think of smearing your tv screen with vaseline and watching it.  Funny though, the previews are all non-compressed, so they look great!  I guess Showtime has decided that if you are too cheap to buy their Blu-Ray product, they will treat you to this messterpiece.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Have enjoyed the Dexter series since the beginning and this season was right up there. Looking forward to the next.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|I watched this by myself-which I don't recommend. I had to yell at the t.v. &#34;don't go in there!!!&#34; to calm my nerves!
B001VLXNO2|4.0|Having heard about Mallory and even read a few vignettes about him, I loved learning about him in this format.  Reading a novel about his life is much more rich and interesting than most biographies.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Maybe I'm just idealizing past experiences with Grisham, but this one just didn't grab me like I wanted it to!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was interested in the story because the movie was so interesting.  I am happy to report that the book was not only better, of course, but worth reading.<br /><br />And yes, rereading.
B005LF9AOQ|5.0|Its How I Met Your Mother, back for a 7th season, and legan...wait for it....dary, as  always.  I love the show, love the series.  If you're looking for a sitcom to start from the beggining, definately a must watch.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again. The product arrived on time in excellent condition and I plan to enjoy this for years to come.
B0063IH60K|5.0|you actually win some games which keeps your interest to challenge you play more making it very hard to put down once started.  Ireally enjoy playing and recommend it highly.  it also plays quickly if you only have a short time in which to play.
B008B1VYP0|1.0|I've heard maybe 1 or 2 of these songs on the radio now and figured maybe those were the bad ones of the album. I checked out the album and and I think only 1 song even had a hint of a guitar in the background? I could be wrong, maybe it was faked as was the entire attempt at making a decent album.<br /><br />Maroon 5 must be really hurting for cash to try to charge anyone for this garbage. His tenure on The Voice should be looked into because for him to judge ANYONE on artistic talent is an absolute joke.
B009LRE040|5.0|This is the best Batman movie since the first; it's much better (in my opinion) than The Dark Knight.  I love it!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|Dull and unexciting.  The story line was less than riveting, and there was little suspense.  I would not recommend it as a good read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book is extremely well written and holds you in suspense.  Great read with several plot twists.  I can understand why it remained on the best selllers list for so long
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|Loved this movie . Gave a insight that most would not have . The actors were good. They were true to the story .
B00846REIS|4.0|The instant attraction of these characters to each other was well written.  I love the relationship and the story.  Not all happily every after stuff.  But, you know in your heart they belong together.  PS, the second book was even better.
B000001Y42|5.0|we are happy with the conditions od this Cd we will like to keep you in mind forthe future great item thanks
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book even though it is not in my usual genre.  I will read the series and recommend the book.
B00000JG4N|5.0|a great oldie om Rock hope we will find some more tittles to grt from you we wil look again great tiem thanks
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed his book and this author.  this was my first time reading her and will read more of the series.
B004UID2LC|5.0|still one of my favorites and yes androids rule, microsoft and apple why? when linux whatever is rock solid.<br /><br />here at my custom guitar factory elnayo.us nobody is allowed to discuss anything nowadays that isn't linux or unix, still works for anything and everything!
B009AJD5E0|3.0|I was doing fine till I found out it was tied in with Alien. If they can put together a good follow up that might change my tune.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|i spent 3 1/2 decades working with ms and apple now i just wonder why?<br /><br />any linux distribution is rock solid and it's a community of literally unlimited resources.<br /><br />yeah that's right android or remote control it's linux guy's and gal's!
038572179X|1.0|In the right hands this story could have been a gripping tale.  Instead Mr. McKewan douses the plot in unnecessary prose to the point I didn't care about the characters or the story. I just wanted to scream...get to the point already! When he finally does its so annoyingly unsatisfying I wanted my time and money back. Guess he wanted the reader to write the book for him. Terrible.
B009IA3O2O|4.0|This was my first Kamelot album in awile and I really enjoyed it! Great music and the vocals were really good too!
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Thing was just as advertised..., when working.  I liked the additional equalizer settings, and was in hunky dorey land.  I babied the thing, kept it in my pocket and only used it on a stationary bike at the gym.  But right after thirty days, it would only play out of one headphone.  I checked the headphones, it was the unit.  A complete loss if not insured.  Be careful with this one.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Just another boring flick, seen this many times before , just different actors, places. Nothing new here. Save your money!
0316286850|5.0|This book helped me become a better make-up artist.  This book breaks down the steps to making a face still look like one's own with a little improvement from make-up.  Even explains about brows, tools to use,  & the photos are just amazing.  Anything Kevyn Aucoin did was fabulous
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Well, I had just received my KFHD and was supposed to be getting down to business. But then I opened this up, and two hours later it was time to go to sleep. You get the point ...
B002U9JEVA|4.0|Pretty much what I expected from Norah Jones.  I enjoy her music very much.  I look forward to buying another of her albums.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I love Once Upon a Time and would recommend this show to anyone that enjoys sci-fi or fantasy films or shows. There isn't much that I look forward to on TV these days and I DVR everything; this and Grimm are the only two shows I watch right away.<br /><br />Also of special note, the picture quality of the blu ray set is AMAZING on my TV.
1594744769|2.0|This book was recommended by a good friend....  Have no idea why - it was horrible.  Maybe teens would like it.  The photos were very authentic but the plot was ridiculous.  Don't bother if you're over 20~
B004LWZWGK|2.0|The digital copy is no better than a farce.  You are REQUIRED to activate a Flixster account to add the digital copy to your secondary UV account.  You cannot bypass it and at that point you're just stuck.  Considering this essentially a bait and switch... \\"get your UV digital copy...oh no wait it goes through flixster\\"<br /><br />The Blu-Ray copy as expected is of fine quality and there's no arguing the quality of the movie itself.  Hero hits the bad streak, but then climbs back to make a stand.  Too bad you won't see it digitally on your mobile device.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|The title says it all, so there really is no need for any extra filler just to make the site happy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Please do not ruin it for yourself by reading too many reviews. I thought it was a terrifyingly brilliant character study.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|This service is for people with egos so large that they feel the need to make every thought and action public and the people who love them.
141659521X|5.0|My husband read this book and said it was very good.  He loves Vince Flynn's novels.  This was purchased for my dad.  I am sure he will love it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is very easy to use and it is very familiar for anyone who has played mahjong. I didn't like that I couldn't play it in landscape position.
030758836X|4.0|Well written, fascinating entre into the mind of a true sociopath.  Scheming, plotting & planning with no conscience. The ending was disappointing- had faith in Nick's ability to catch her at her own game and slam her!
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Good enough to get book 3. Although slow to start action gets better in the later chapters. Only anti is coming to grips with all the names of characters as the book grows.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Although sometimes not there are extended scenes that seem uninspired, the series manages to deliver with amazing plot twists. The secondary characters lack development, so that when they sometimes die you really could care less.
B000002AGN|5.0|There are sad moments in which one would not want to review the departure of those giants of jazz. But sooner or later this crucial moment arrives.<br /><br />Dave Brubeck was a legend. The notable contribution of his masterwork Take Five made many people would turn the attention respect the inmense posibilities the jazz had to offer and give. He was an untired sculptor of the genre, always betting, always taking risks but with the steeled conviction of his ideals.<br /><br />Needless to say this album is in music a true musical jewel for the ages to come.<br /><br />Rest in peace.
B005EVVESM|5.0|Great cd. You can't beat the music that Maroon 5 plays, lyrics and everything about it is real, real good.
034580404X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, real life situations. There was a story behind the madness. It was real, someone looking for love. This was my first time reading a book of this content and I had heard so much about it. I would love to read more books by the author.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved this season!! This show just keeps getting better!! Seriously....I've gotten so 'into it' that I've caught myself yelling 'go back go back' at the tv like they could hear me lol XD
B000W93CHC|5.0|After watching the TV mini, I couldn't wait to get the books and they were just as good as the movie.  A very realistic look into the lives of many class of people during that time period.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Macklemore is absolutely sick.. This album is really sweet and i would strongly encourage anyone who likes music to get it
B001MSMULG|4.0|I like suspense so this was a good read.  Character development was thorough, story line consistent and believable.  I recommend this book to those who enjoy these attributes.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I await the release of this series.  I buy a kindle edition for myself, and 2 hard copies. One for my 3 grandkids to share and one for a friend's grandson.  The books and movies are great.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|I think this is the best rock blues band in the world right now.  Derek Trucks is phenomenal on guitar, a real artist.  Susan Tedeschi  is also great on guitar but her voice is so sweet singing the blues.  All the rest of the support artists are tight and really in tune with each other.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|My only complaint is, the watch needs daily winding, morning and night, to keep proper time or to even keep going.<br />But I am not so active as most people.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|Nice product, love that its nice and solid! It'll be perfect for keeping my kindle safe from the dog and for carrying it safely in my bag.
B008BMWKXO|2.0|I turned it off half-way through, waiting for it to get better. Just seemed strange with nothing to hold my interest.
1439152802|3.0|This is the first Kate Morton book I've read. I found it well researched and well written. The story takes the reader back and forth many times between wartime London and the present as a daughter, Laurel, seeks to learn why her ailing mother, Dolly, murdered a stranger as he approached their farmhouse. Laurel was 16 at the time and, unbeknownst to her mother, witnessed the crime. We meet the young Dolly, her boyfriend Jimmy, and another woman, Vivien, as their lives intertwine during the blitz. We also meet Laurel's three sisters in some detail.  It took me a long time to get into the story because I found the timeframe changes bothersome, and the characters difficult to relate to, particularly the youthful Dolly, who was nothing if not shallow.  But I kept reading and about halfway through I found the plot thickening and my curiosity growing. This was a complicated story filled with twists and turns and I thought the ending quite amazing, and no, I hadn't guessed it, although in hindsight there were plenty of clues.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I like Rod Stewart and this is a nice mix of songs..If you like Rod you will love his Christmas album.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The book had potential but I must say the ending chapter seemed a bit unrealistic and elicited a multitude of eye rolls on my part. The heroine in the story was to be this independent woman but she came off as a bit weak willed and somewhat annoying.  The cousin and her friends were completely useless characters and could have been left out of the plot.  The only thing I found enjoyable about this book was the banter between Jeff and Connor.
1451648537|5.0|So well written. I was honestly hooked and could not put it down, I don't think many biographies have the ability to do that. Loved the pictures in the middle! :)
B009NQKPUW|3.0|If left me with more questions than it answered. At the end I felt that the entire thing was as unresolved as when the movie started. Of course this helps if they're doing a sequel but it makes the movie fall short of how great it could've been.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Something different. No car chases.  The actors are English and the dialogue is too. Dependable performances from the actors.  I enjoyed it.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|Men in black is a great movie but as far as watching it on Amazon,not so good,get yo s**t together techs at amazon
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I gave this movie as gift which was greatly appreciated.  Again, the movie qualitly was excellent.  Your products are excellent.
0156027321|4.0|I liked this book a lot, but mostly because of Richard Parker, (the tiger).  Even though he has no voice, I empathized with him the most and I was most fascinated with his motivations.<br /><br />I was afraid I would not finish the book at first, because of the rambling preamble, but nearing the midpoint when the \\"action\\" starts, I knew it was going to be ok and for once a book that started slow built and kept getting better!  Pi's cerebral machinations in the beginning served as the foundation for his subsequent mental toughness.<br /><br />The ending I found to be satisfying and unpredictable, at least as far as Richard Parker was concerned.  I was happy that the author didn't go for the cliche \\"sad\\" or \\"happy\\" ending.<br /><br />I normally favor horror/sci-fi/fantasy/mystery books but this was a nice break from my usual fare.  I would recommend it, especially for animal lovers.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|The picture was clear.  I have watched this movie several times and have given this movie to friends to watch.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I have several reviews on this show, its unique, definitely one of a kind. Can't seem to get enough of this show
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast pace book with many interesting characters. The type of story that you do not want to put down until it is finished.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have seen every show through every season, and this show is a can't miss. Different than most, new creatures, anf friends in some odd beings,that you would not think possible.Great for everyone, not too scary, just interesting, and exciting.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is one of the BEST I have read in a long time! If only I could escape into Rothfuss's magical and sophisticated world of fantastic characters and adventure...this is more than just another fantasy novel, this is a series that will be treasured for years to come.  In a way, it's an adult version of Harry Potter intermingled with the graceful poetic style of Tad Williams' &#34;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&#34; series.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|You shouldn't miss it. Even if you are not interested in food, like me, you will still enjoy the book
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My thirty year old daughter shared this with my 4 year old grandson who shared it with me.  We all like this a great deal. I am 62 years old<br />.
0880794968|3.0|This deck looks like it was made for children. The pictures have a cartoony look and the facial expressions have been changed quite a bit.<br /><br />I ordered them because it seems many of the most well-known tarot experts' books use the Universal deck.<br /><br />Disappointed with this deck.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Dec. 6th, 2012 9:21 am<br />  I have not purchased all of season 1 yet.  But I have bought  the first 7 episodes and I have l have always like The Star Trek Voyager  when it was on tv, so so so many years ago! If I could buy the whole set 1-7 right now I would! But when you are short of money it has to take time, and little by little!!!!<br />  I am very grateful that Amazon is allowing you to buy them one at a time here on their website on video on demand or all of the seasons you are watching!!!  Oh I wished I had known about it much earlier, but lost internet for 2 months, and I had other commitments to honor. And When I got my internet back and I came to my Amazon Acount and saw the deal they were having, I bought and watched 7 Episodes so far of season 1 and I love them!!!!! I can't wait til I can buy more, but when money is short it takes time!<br /> THANK YOU AMAZON, FOR WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH THE STAR TREK VOYAGER  SERIES!!!! Had I not had other commitments I would have bought the whole season 1 set, because I would have been able to save money! But I did not have it.  But THANK YOU !!!!!  If you have this same offer next month I would be able then!<br />  I use to when I was younger, watch all the STAR TREK SHOWS, But When They Came Out With Star Trek Voyager, It Became My Very Favorite!!!!!  I have had the Whole SERIES On My Wish List, But just did not have the money to purchase It!<br />  I hope anyone who loves Star Trek Voyager takes advantage of the offer that Amazon is offering now, and I hope they will continue it  longer for those who are on a fixed or low income budget so we can own the complete series!<br />Polar 2[Eya-Andrea]

B00005JKDR|1.0|I had the original DVD set by Disney but unfortunately lost it in the last couple of weeks, which was why I bought this set. Upon receipt, the DVD case was broken, first irritation. After opening the DVD, this is what I found.  This set is missing the papers in the inside that give your &#34;rewards&#34; code, the dvd is actually blurry, and is also a completely different DVD case.  I purchased this set for $54.99 as my daughter loves it, after my purchase I saw that it is now 49.99, you can imagine my irritation, even just at a $5 difference. Also, I made a hurried purchase as they said there was only one left in stock, since this DVD is in the Disney vault right now, I had no way of purchasing another new copy from anyone else, and even though this was twice what I paid for my original copy, I bought it since it was the &#34;last copy&#34;, and was excited to have found one last new copy! Now it says there are 3 more copies.  Seems suspicious to me.  If this is a duplication, Amazon should be aware, as this is illegal.  I will be returning this and asking for a refund.  It's not worth $54.99 to me for what appears to be a duplication.  I'll wait another year for the real deal.<br /><br />Unhappy
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I chose to buy this trilogy because we rented the movie &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;, and I really liked the movie.  I figured if the movie was that good, the books would be much better...I was right. I have already read all three books and re reading them .
B0000VCZK2|5.0|First, I do not know why I am seeing so many 1 star reviews that are just reviewing ONE movie.Yes yes we all know the Prison Planet (3rd) movie was horrible.But this is specially for the Aline Quad set with all the extra  bonuses.<br /><br />That being said, this 9 disk set is great for the Aliens fan.Even though I already had all the Alien movies except 3 I got this box set. I love all the extras and on mine I did not have any problem with sound or any off dubbing so I am not sure what is going on with that one guys copy. Perhaps his copy is a fake. I 'm just saying.<br /><br />So in conclusion, this would make a awesome gift for anyone who is a fan of the series with enough bonus material on each movie to keep them occupied for days.
B000MQPKVG|4.0|Beautiful cinematography--superb acting-quite enjoyable movie---thank you. I would surely enjoy seeing these particular actors on the stage in person--skilled and their craft is quite brilliant.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|I am a long time fan of fairy tales and the retelling of fairy tells as long as there is something original in them from the writer/director etc. This movie \\"borrowed\\" a lot of things from other stories,<br /><br />A few movies  that seemed to heavily influence the writer or director:<br /><br />The Never Ending Story<br />Willow<br />Lord of the rings<br />Princess Mononoke( instead of cute Kodoma its fairies though,oooh)<br /><br />The scenes were nicely shot ,the acting was good all except the main girl who played Snow White. I have  never seen any of the movies that she is famous for (gasp) and I can't say that I am sorry.<br /><br />She didn't really have too many lines in the movie which is a good thing because if you notice, she keeps her mouth open the whole time and I kept looking at her large front teeth that seem to hang down lower then the rest.It was really distracting to me .<br /><br />The character Snow White was pretty helpless, I thought this was going to be more of a kick butt warrior type Snow White because the pre-views. Nope.Aside from her neat sliding escape she is pretty lame.<br /><br />My favorite line, \\" Do you need a Bow-man?\\"<br /><br />SO if you are a fan of those other types of movies I would watch it but to me it really doesn't add anything spectacular to the genre.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Wanted this for forever! And the price was SOOO right! :D Eight movies for $30.00? Yes sir! I'm your gal!
B0036BK6MW|4.0|Feel good Cinderella type movie!If you are looking for a movie that is based on a true story with good acting, action, football and yes heart warming scenes, this is for you.<br /><br />The reason why I think its a great date movie or movie to watch with your spouse is because it has enough content for both.Enough football  to garner men's attention and enough emotional content for women, so a great movie to watch for a couple!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is typical Michael Moore.. He knows what he is filming, and talking about and shows you the lies this country was given when it comes to national health care... Every time I see this, I wonder why in the USA those on the &#34;right&#34; believe that health care is only for the rich and not for everyone..
1419705849|4.0|Parents beware! This is one of these books that it is best to read together. Why?<br /><br />Because this book has cute drawings in the doodle form, hilarious experiences from school, a sometimes over confident kid, a typical bully older brother and plenty of gross out humor. Everything that a boy would like!<br />Its nice to see a clean read for tweens ( since so many books now a days are pushing the envelope) Why introduced your kid to 'gritty real life' books when they have to experience that soon enough?<br /><br />Let your kid continue being a kid for awhile and let them read Diary of a Wimpy Kid. Its fun and more importantly, relatable to you child ,especially at this age( going in to Junior High).
B005LAIGP0|3.0|Set in the Edwardian-era England, \\"The Woman in Black\\" is an old-fashioned horror movie that reminds us of Victorian ghost stories. This is not surprising, as the film (based on a Susan Hill novel) is produced by the newly revived Hammer studio, once known for its \\"Dracula\\" franchise starring Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe is Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer on the verge of losing his position in the firm. As a final chance to keep his job, he is sent to a small British town, where he has to find a certain document at the Eel Marsh House on an estate that is cut off from the outside world. The people there obviously do not want him in their town, however. The local lawyer is not cooperative. Soon Arthur is to learn the reason - some terrifying things about \\"The Woman in Black.\\"<br /><br />The 2012 film version of \\"The Woman in Black\\" (the original book was made into a TV movie starring Adrian Rawlins as Arthur Kipps in 1989) benefits from the atmospheric photography and the production designs of the desolate Eel Marsh House that alone is worth watching. Daniel Radcliffe turns in effective performance a widowed father, still mourning his wife's death, though he looks a little too young for the role of a father, if not a lawyer.<br /><br />What the film doesn't have is any new ideas to scare us. As to the film's scares, the best part is probably the \\"Ju-On\\"-inspired opening, which is creepy enough, but the film itself nds to depend on the hackneyed techniques like sudden big sound. Some of them are so predictable that you can see them coming from miles away.<br /><br />Perhaps we have seen so many similar-themed thrillers since the original book was published, \\"The Orphanage\\" for example, films with more inventive and creative ways to surprise and scare us. Had it been made much earlier (by ten years or more), \\"The Woman in Black\\" would have been a more scary movie.

0307278255|4.0|This is a collection of short stories by Jhumpa Lahiri who is better known for her book, made into a film, called Namesake. Although a collection of stories, the stories, some more than others, are more like novels. The last three stories in the book are linked. The author uses a quote from Nathaniel Hawthorne's book, The Custom House, to derive the title.  The quote is thought provoking, but while there is the common thread of characters of Bengali origin in each one of the stories, they do not always bring out the thrust of the quote.<br /><br />Jhumpa Lahiri is a good writer. The characters become vivid, the narrative flows, and often there is a shock ending . She has the ability to draw clearly characters of different ages, and of different backgrounds. Her focus is the complexities of human relations and particularly the  engagements of people of Bengali origin in different contexts. This could be a set text for any student of immigrants and their settlement.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth a read, although the reader may not always find the stories equally convincing. For instance, while the story entitled Unaccustomed Earth is brilliant, the thrust of  A Choice of Accommodations is not clear. Hell Heaven is very moving, but many questions remain unanswered in Only Goodness. Writers often leave some loose threads so the reader can keep on thinking about situations described in the writing, but the reader does not always feel some scenarios described are credible. Yet the book makes you want to read more of Jhumpa Lahiri's work.
0307352145|4.0|In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain explores the differences between introverts and extroverts and how the Extrovert Ideal has taken over in America. As an introvert myself, I found a great deal of validation in reading this book. For example, in the first part Cain writes about introverts in the workplace and how teamwork and open office floor plans instead of cubicles usually lead to less productivity and creativity. As someone who always hated group projects in school and the corporate world, that was just what I wanted to hear. Luckily, I left the corporate world a couple of years before open office floor plans came into vogue.<br /><br />Part two of the book dealt with the biology of being either an introvert or extrovert. Cain makes generalizations about how introverts and extroverts behave and I couldn't help focusing on the ways in which I don't conform to her stereotypical introvert. No one does completely I'm sure but generalizations had to be made for the sake of conciseness. It was interesting to learn about how the brain actually responds to various situations differently in introverts versus extroverts.<br /><br />In part three of the book, Cain discusses Asian Americans which are a theoretically introverted people. While I have no doubt that Cain did a lot of research for the whole book, including this part, I'm uncomfortable when generalizations are made about an entire race or ethnic group. Since I'm not Asian American and I haven't done any of my own research, I can't say how accurate Cain's assumptions about them actually are.<br /><br />Part four is about how to function in society as an introvert, including how to fake being an extrovert when necessary. Cain also offers advice on how an extroverted parent should deal with an introverted child. I would have also appreciated tips on how an introverted parent should parent an extroverted child. One, possibly two, of my children are extroverts and my husband is also an introvert like me so we could definitely use some help with that.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this book and I think other introverts will too. Extroverts should read this book as well to better understand their introverted friends and colleagues. This is a book for everyone.and is also an introvert like me so we could definitely use some help with that.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this book and I think other introverts will too. Extroverts should read this book as well to better understand their introverted friends and colleagues. This is a book for everyone.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Lincoln Team of Rivals what a great read was always interested in President Lincoln and the Civil War he was truly a great man
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Serkis brings life to Ceasar with a stark realistic approach. His Golum and Kong are similarly heartfelt and &#34;human&#34;. You actually find yourself believing in them, and in this case, understanding his goals. This imaginative retelling of the begining of the tale (&#34;Conquest&#34; in the original series) is a great start to a series of films that should get better and better.
B009LRE040|5.0|this movie is very addictive i love how they make you have slight sympathy for the villian. Bane played his role so well i almost found myself cheering him on. But as always the dark knight since of heroism is very movie but in this film there is alot more at stake than a random mad man like the Joker. i loved it if superman is anything like this movie than finally DC Comics may be able to take back comic movie supremacy from Marvel Comics..........Maybe,........nah
B005G4TJI4|4.0|as always the special effects were mind-bogglingly cool, but the plot had so many twists and turns that it was impossible to follow. so we ignored the &#34;why&#34; and just had a good old romp with Bumblebee and friends. The Blue Ray DVD is spectacular to look at and more then makes up for lack of plot.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Absolutely love this show, have been waiting and waiting for Season 2 to appear, have no idea why it is not available to watch on Instant video's. Even tried to call to find out, they had no answere. Really bummed!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|after seeing the film in 3D I watched it in IMAX 3D and saw the worms: &#34;from humble beginings&#34; indeed! to now know &#34;the Alien&#34; started from a botched bioweapon mishap fits in with real life so well it mind boggling. The thorough making of stuff imparts more &#34;facts&#34; to the story. I can't wait for the next film: I expect Noomi to go all Sigourney on the engineers home planet! ...and David will make himself a body of some sort, undoubtedly not humanoid. Maybe the third in the series will end with an engineer leaving the home planet with a load of eggs. Full circle.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|Love this series!! Glad to have just started watching it!  Just started buying all the episodes that came out! Got really good deals on Amazon!
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|When I saw this in the theatre I was expecting a quality Disney produt, but it was the worst 3D I have ever seen. It was like cardboard cutouts: no layers. The story wasn't too bad, but the flim was just updated special effects from the first, better, movie. When the DVD arrived, the Blue Ray disc would not only NOT play, but it caused my new player to shut down! Disney couldn't find a problem so Amazon gave us a refund.
1741791529|5.0|What I like of this book was the top 10 things to do in Iran. The number one listed is: Meet the people. So I did. What a pleasure!  Iranians are the best nicest people I have met in all my travels. Mexicans are nice but Iranians are at the top.<br /><br />This book is a travel book backed up by the reputation of Lonely Planet. I recommend this guide to Iran, being a serious traveler. It is better than just going by yourself without knowing anything.<br /><br />NOTE: Iran has put a great effort to have signs in both Farsi and English. So it is easier to travel around even if you don't buy this book. Young people (the vast majority of Iranians) typically speak English. Ask them for directions if you get lost. Use this travel guide as a back up. Adventure yourself into this great country. You'll be fine. Fun and making friends is Guaranteed.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|The less you know about this film before seeing it, the more impactful it will be.  It brought me to tears.
B000IZ0KRK|4.0|This is a tragic story.  Done very well.  It makes you go back in time and empathize with the characters.  I recommend it!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Put any two of these action stars in a movie and you have a good movie. Put all of these guys in one movie and you've made history. This is an action movie lovers film at its best. I hope they make a third Expendables. Loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so captivating, it keeps you at the edge of your seat. I know it can be very gruesome at times but the characters are the ones that keep me hooked. With their engaging performances, you just connect with them and you want to know what will happen next.
B001UJUGZY|2.0|i was expecting a scary movie, i fell asleep : ( a big dissappointment from what i had expected. fast delevery though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really expounded upon the emotional side of the characters, much deeper dive than the first. Really appreciated the detail EL James went into, made the fictional characters tangible.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|This movie was fine but I can't believe there are no captions on these movies.  I guess no movies from Amazon have captioned.  So my daughter who is deaf can not enjoy this service!  I hope Amazon changes this soon
B007LB1O3I|5.0|Not the best songwriting but it is Madonna and she always comes out swinging. I love her no matter how lacking her songs are!
