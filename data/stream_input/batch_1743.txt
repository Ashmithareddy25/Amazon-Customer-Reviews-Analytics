Clarke's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" is an epoch-spanning imagining of humankind's first contact with alien life. Most people know the core story from Stanley Kubrick's film of the same title. What's less known is that the book and screenplay were produced in parallel; Clarke and Kubrick working closely together on both.<br /><br />This edition of the book includes a foreword by Clarke, which provides insights into the story's production. He describes an early conversation with the great director, where Kubrick tells him, \\"What I want is a theme of mythic grandeur.\\" Clarke certainly delivered.<br /><br />The story revolves around a monolithic stone-like entity that simply appears on earth 3 million years before modern times. The obelisk explores the mental and physical \\"skills\\" of individual man-apes, identifying which have the capacity to carry forth their subtly enhanced genetics. And while the movie is known for it's groundbreaking cinematography and special effects, in equal parts with its story-telling vagaries, Clarke's exposition-strong style draws a clear picture of how this alien-borne object was built to experiment, prod and alter the life forms it finds.<br /><br />Not wholly through the serendipity of natural selection, but through delicate alien modifications, do these man-apes take the first tentative steps down their evolutionary paths. The alien interference is subtle; it provides sort of an evolutionary jump-start and then disappears as suddenly as it appeared. Clarke writes, \\"...the man-apes had been given their first chance. There would be no second one; the future was, very literally, in their own hands.\\"<br /><br />One of the first gifts of enlightenment explored by the man-apes is the use of tools, and the actualization that they can be used to defend...and kill.<br /><br />A clear theme throughout,Clarke writes on the impact of the human propensity towards violence. Using the monolith's suggestion for the man-ape's adoption of tools as the starting point, Clarke writes that the physical and mental abilities to lay waste to nature and man, up close and at a distance, has defined human evolution -- from the first Promethean spark of consciousness through his fictional 2001 and beyond.<br /><br />The novel jumps to the late 20th century. Man has uncovered a monolith buried deep below the surface of the moon. Once the 3 million year old object absorbs the first rays of the sun, a burst of energy explodes towards space. After millions of years of solitude, humankind inadvertently pulls the trigger on its next major evolutionary leap. The burst of energy blows through the solar system targeted at a small moon orbiting Saturn.<br /><br />Contextually, this story was written during the dawn of the space age. Russian satellites had orbited the earth and Kennedy had rallied America behind its own goals to put a man on the moon. Science and technology were at the forefront of culture. Consideration of the possibility of alien life was a natural outcome of this collective thought.<br /><br />Clarke explores one of the most common themes in science fiction, that of 'First Contact': \\"The political and social implications were immense; every person of real intelligence--everyone who looked an inch beyond his nose--would find his life, his values, his philosophy, subtly changed. Even if nothing whatsoever was discovered about (the monolith), and it remained an eternal mystery, Man would know that he was not unique in the universe. All futures must now contain this possibility.\\"<br /><br />The final third of the story follows astronaut David Bowman aboard a spaceship powering towards the destination of the moon-monolith's energy burst. The memorable HAL-9000 accompanies Bowman on his journey and despite the supercomputer-character's renown, fills only a relatively brief portion of the book. HAL represents a step on the continuum of humankind's evolutionary ascent. It represents the convergence of man and machine. As man developed machines to enhance his existence, he took a step further by transferring human consciousness to machine, which, to dire results, includes all of man's neuroses and psychoses.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the slow build to human-like sentience of HAL. Following its very purposeful deceptions and murder, HAL says to Bowman rather innocently, \\"is your confidence in me fully restored? You know that I have the greatest possible enthusiasm for this mission.\\"<br /><br />Clarke's novel evokes the very familiar pacing and mood of Kubrick's film. The details are rich, the exposition extensive and all encompassing.<br /><br />The book finishes with a much more satisfying conclusion than the movie. Clarke actually provides an explanation for the sequences of Bowman's final interactions with the alien intelligence, and his own fate. His conclusion satisfies years of frustrated confusion with Kubrick's final scenes.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Terrific story, fabulous character development, beautifully written overall. Compelled to reread sentences and whole paragraphs, not because they were difficult to comprehend, but because they were such a pleasure to read the first time.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Rather long and drawn out--like TMI too much information. To quote Ogden Nash,\\"If called by this Panther, don't anther.\\"  I expected more from DeMille.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once I started reading &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. Had to read all three in the series.
B0040HO16S|5.0|I am a sucker for period pieces and this one doesn't disappoint!  Set in 19th Century rural England, this series follows several (6 or 7) sets of characters, and is a little like a cross between \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and \\"The Young and the Restless\\", and a whole lot like \\"Cranford\\".  The characters ARE stereotypical but loveable, and if you're not too much of a cynic, it shouldn't matter much.  The beauty lies in the relationship between characters, not the characters themselves, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Having scorched through the first season, I am very glad that it wasn't the only one!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|We purchased this for our teenage daughter. It does hold up to being dropped into sink full of water. So far so good. Great product!
B009LHJYA0|4.0|Ill Ni&ntilde;o continue to be consistent if nothing more.  There is no ground-breaking metal here but it is very good.  It may just be me but the growling vocals seem harsher which makes the juxtaposition of the melodic vocals that much more pronounced.  I think this is a plus.  Technically, it is precise and shows that Ill Ni&ntilde;o are no where near done.  Get out and support them if you can.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I couldn't put it down. I don't read a ton, but this book was just so unbelievably good! Pick it up now!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing and the new 0.5.0 update finally came out!!!!! im so excited!!! Mojang, keep up the good work, especially you @jbenhardsson on twitter
B001RR35I4|3.0|I was disappointed that the subtitles couldn't be turned off.  That really should be indicated on the information page.  I wanted to use it for my German students.  Usually I try to buy German versions in Germany, but I wasn't able to get it the last time there.  So, it's pretty much useless as a teaching tool, since the students would be reading the English subtitles.  Ah well, live and learn.  I'll just have to find someone in Germany to find me a copy without English.  Money ill spent.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I loved the album its so amazing !!<br />buy it right now ! the album cover looks agrait and the LOUD DVD cant wait until it release :(
B005K2YRVG|5.0|When I was shopping for protection for my Kindle, I had a decision to make.  Did I want a cover that would fold out and allow me to read my Kindle without removing it and even making it feel more like a book, or did I want the envelope sleeve?  I went with the envelope sleeve because I like the feel of the naked Kindle.  My Kindle touch fits snuggly into this sleeve and offers great protection when it is accidently dropped.  Great value for the price.  The color selection leaves a little to be desired, though.  I got the black because that's the only one I could stomach.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is the best version of Jane Eyre I've seen.  I loved the way they captured the gothic themes and feel of the book, not only by imitating the dialog, but with some amazing acting, soundtrack, and especially art direction.  It was really lovely, I could watch it again and again.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great and easy read. Perfect for travel or by the pool/seaside. Love how Grisham spins his tale and keeps you guessing as to how the protagonist pulls off the heist and fools the government. A little formulaic, but it works for me!
B007L6VR12|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie--buy the DVD and watch it--it is hilarious...We originally saw in the theater and knew we would want to watch it again--so we purchased the DVD.
0062082353|5.0|A direct hit, no pun intended.  Chris Kyle is the real deal, an honest to goodness American, Patriot and SEAL.  No other sniper in the annals of modern American warfare has accomplished what Chris Kyle has.  Taking lives is one thing depending on how you look at it, saving lives is another and with each kill that is exactly what Chris Kyle was doing for the US forces and his own team member when he put his job skills to work.
1579129129|5.0|I bought this book for my husband - he has really enjoyed it. We originally saw it at a Museum in Philadelphia.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Beautifully written, as always.  Makes you feel you are experiencing the love, joy, and sorrow of those he is writing about.  Nicolas Sparks never lets you down.  Would definitely recommend.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|This is a MUST for all with a new Kindle Fire HD - I'm not quite sure why it wasn't included with the Kindle--but it works great!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like this app fun and easy to use. Lots of set ups to pick from and challenging enough for all levels.
B003YJEXL6|5.0|This book is eye opening, intelligently written, and very interesting. Everyone should know about the delusions of gender. I give it five stars and two thumbs up
B003MC5N28|3.0|What can I say it was a just fine book that kind of ended in a horrible way. I don't understand why the author didn't complete the story.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Every word spoke to me.  Dr. Davis gave clear examples and lots<br />of scientific proof.  I also liked the recipes.Giving up wheat<br />has not hampered my life, but only added health and less bloat.<br />Thank you for writing this book. T Cat Taylor
B001GE6L0M|5.0|This is a must for any fan of Pink Floyd, some old, some new. Exceptional rendition of 'Shine on You Crazy Diamond'.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was concerned that Dr. Alexander would impress me as just another ego-inflated doctor while simultaneously talking down to the readers.  Not at all.  I was left with the impression he truly wants to share his remarkable experience with everyone to turn more people toward God.  Good luck, Doctor.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|A real feel good book, easy to understand and incredible to imagine how much it can change your life for the better.<br />Off to read it again and again.<br />Thank you and i am forever grateful.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I tried to indulge my Pinterest addiction on my Kindle Fire and it was a pain!  This makes it so much easier.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|If you are a fan of The Black Keys...you HAVE GOT TO get this CD. Songs of Junior Kimbrough...great blues sound!
B008JAGZDE|3.0|If you've seen the previous American Pie movies, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect.  If not, start with the first one, its the best.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|hmm  what to say about this book.  i loved Gideon and Eva.  This story was like a rollercoaster of emotions, and loved it every minute.  Can't wait till the next installment
B007MNV5WU|3.0|great game but needs more updates. love it though. fun to play and funnnnnn by it.good game...ok now I'm done.
B009AOFNU4|4.0|Just like my title says.. This is by far the BEST portable controller out right now. If you are looking for a controller to pair with your phone.. this is it. Far better than the Nyko, Gametel & even the Moga in my opinion. It's built sturdy, pairs seemlesly & works on just about everything I've tried it on... my ONLY gripe is that it doesn't have trigger buttons. Aside from that.. it's perfect for traveling or to simply put in your pocket to play anytime/ anywhere. The Moga would have been perfect if it had a D-Pad.. but for reasons I can't understand they chose not to include a D-pad.. considering that a lot of people play old school game on emulators.. the D-Pad is pretty much a neccesaty in my opinion.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I did not feel that this work was up to DeMille's usual excellent story telling.  Hipefully his next book will be better
B009NTNHJU|5.0|This album remind me of her mixtape days. No POP. All Hip-Hop (Even though i like her POP songs). It's a lyrical masterpiece. Crazy flow, dope beats, & great  punchlines & metaphors. If you a fan of her mixtape music you'll love it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|after the last update I have had nothing but problems, doesn't clear notifications after you've seen them, can't view messages and can't update status or upload photos.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|its a fun game. easy to play and learn. i hate that they make you buy gold though if you want better items.
0547884591|5.0|I got alot out of Tim's other 2 books and wasn't sure if this one could top the others. From what I've read thus far it's looking like it will. With so many distractions in today's world, I tend to not even start a task such as learning a language because of the potential time involved in the process. I've been meaning to learn German so that I can communicate with my relatives for a long time now but the overwhelming thought of the process prevents me from even starting. I'm really excited about applying Tim's methods to language acquisition and other things.<br />Mick
0399226907|3.0|The inside was fine but the cover had more damage than I would have expected.  This is for my baby and I wanted it to be nicer.  It seems kids books are judged quite as harsh as adult books.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My brother has me hooked on this series, season 3 has been the best yet!!  I don't get this channel so Amazon prime has been a godsend!! -ktchish
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I'm a long time fan and I really wanted to love it.  However, I think the chemistry between Steven and Joe is long gone and that helps kill all efforts regardless of whether they went with a return to the 70's, today's pop, or the combo.  Even when they're pi$$ed at each other they have chemistry but now I don't feel they have anything or if they do it isn't being translated into music anymore.  They're going through the motions for the paycheck IMO.<br /><br />I could go into detail and pick it apart but everyone else already did that.  Except the voice over at the beginning and end???? WTH? Gag, bleh, ick.  I think that would feel pompous and overstated even if the album was fantastic.<br /><br />Even though Honkin on Bobo is cover songs it is by far their best effort since Pump.
B000002H6C|5.0|I love the Metallica song &#34;One&#34;.  If you have never heard it, you are sure missing out.  It has a lot of instrumental for the intro and it's soft and hard at the same time.  A classic must-have!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Somewhat disappointed in this book.  Story line was weak and not very believable.  Wouldn't recommend it.  I have read all of his books and thought this was his poorest one.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Sly hits a home run again with THE EXPENDABLES # 2. Jean-Claude, Chuck Norris and<br />Liam Hemsworth added to the cast excel the action to the next level. The movie<br />is the apex of this genre. DON'T MISS IT.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|As always its,a fun game . I especially enjoyed the challenging water scenes, not experienced in other Angry Bird games that I have played
B008E374PO|5.0|Ok, so this album isn't like the other Owl City albums and most of the songs on here are all dance. I love the cd and have been listening to him for a few years and yes at times as a listener we get stuck on an artist and how they write the songs and music. But sometimes when an artist breaks his mold every once in awhile it can be either refreshing or just down right terrible. This time this artist has made this new cd so refreshing it makes you want to sing, hum and do the pee-pee dance! It is up lifting which normally his lyrics can be moody and somewhat dark. He just got over a break-up so I think it was wise of him to do an up lifting album this time around. His lyrics still have his sharp wit but with a smile...enjoy!
B005HJU7HA|4.0|This is much reading for the price and it is very well done.  I would have liked a little more separation between stories.
B00330UFQS|5.0|It's great would tell others about it without a doubt ,I listen to the music all day long, it is great
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was one of John Grisham's best.  Really so clever.  Where does he find his plots?<br />Just could not put it down.  Congratulations, Mr. Grisham.
B009P13RQY|5.0|Great album - it's intense with a huge sound. If you liked The Sword's previous releases your in for a real treat. If you've never listened to them before, I suggest starting here. Fans of classc or hard rock/proto-metal bands will enjoy The Sword. I bout the version that had the extra songs - there's a really cool ZZ Top,cover.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and found it to be a quick read. I would recommend it if you like legal stories. It is funny and certainly kept my attention especially as it neared the climax.
B000B3MIZG|1.0|Amazon did not identify this company as European shipping out of the Netherlands.  Nor did they identify this unplayable DVD as Region 2.  They asked me to mail it back to England at my expense to ruminate on whether Zoverstock would consider a refund.  But then they already told me it was my fault for not discovering that it was region 2 and unplayable in America.  Amazon said that I might be an American soldier stationed in England who actually wanted a DVD that would play there, in spite of my California address.  Amazon also said that their policy was that the buyer , not them had to discover the true region of the DVD before the purchase, which is very difficult to do for a used DVD.  I got ripped off.  And since I replaced my VHS library with DVDs all at the same time, I got ripped off 2 more times buying region 2 DVDs whi8ch Amazon will not cover on their buyer satisfaction warranty.  So Amazon also has a buyer beware policy.  By the way, the Region listed above did not appear on the product description until after the transaction was completed.  They do not list regions prior to purchase.  So buying used DVDs is a game of &#34;Gothcha&#34; since they can say they told you after the fact when it is too late to get a refund or coverage under Amazon's warranty.  Talan
0307990850|4.0|This book keep me interested through out.  I enjoyed the bigger than life Jack Reacher main character.  Interesting info regarding FBI and their procedures.  Looking forward to reading another Jack Reacher story.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Came super fast, super high quality but there is this feedback noise, but it's not serious at all. Better than any headset i've ever owned.<br /><br />Pros: Great quality, very comfy, relatively light, long cord.<br /><br />Cons: Slight feedback noise (hardly a problem)<br /><br />I definitely recommend it and its pretty cheap for a gaming headset.
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is a ton of fun. I can die rich or poor.  There are a lot of challenges.  It isn't just about running.
B008220CC4|4.0|Ok so it had quite a few scary jumpy parts but sinister wasn't terribly scary. Insidious was much scarier and put together a little bit better but don't get me wrong Sinister is still a fun movie. I've always enjoyed horror movies and every year I expect at least one to two really good ones to come out. This was one of them! Me and my wife enjoyed it very much. It does take a little while to get to the point but hey that just good story telling and suspense that has to build up to prepare you for the scary parts... right? Check this one out especially if you love horror movies like me!
B0083P1QUM|1.0|This book seemed to be a short story she tried to turn into a book. It was bogged down with details that made me skip whole pages at a time. The author needs to spend less time telling us the character's every thought. The story had very little substance.<br />The ending had me saying &#34;Really. Really?&#34;  I'm afraid Ms Cornwell has &#34;jumped the shark&#34; with this book.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|I went into the first listening of this album with expectations well above where I should have.  That is partly due to the available reviews of the album by the press who had access prior to the release and partly due to my love of what Aerosmith does.  Of the former, I read that the album title was placing the output more in line with \\"Toys\\" and \\"Rocks\\" releases from the seventies, meaning it would have - in my mind - the raunchy, in your face lyrics that somehow slid into AM radio and the hard driving and rhythmic guitar leads that land outside guitar virtuosity but made the songs stick in your head.  Aerosmith has reinvented itself several times to stay relevant and done a great job of drawing in new listeners while keeping true to the people who love the old stuff.  I'm okay with that compromise for the most part.  The problem is that, the further they go along this road, it seems more like a fight between Steven Tyler's input and that of the rest of the band.  It feels like each new album is more produced than the last and this one is no different.  The spacing just feels off.  Going back and listening to the older albums, you hear space - and it works.  On this album, its almost as if the band is uncomfortable without something filling each moment.  It feels as if it would be a better album if someone would cut more out, whether that's backing vocals, effects, or something.  I'm actually looking forward to hearing some of this stuff live to see if it sounds better without the fill.  Hopefully having the boys tour together will help them sort out some of the feel that seems off.  I also hope that Joe is able to figure out how to make some of the songs have more rhythmic fills to make them sound more accessible.  All that said, it's Aerosmith.  Few bands still around can make decent music that has that dynamic that works between the rhythm section, the leads, and the vocals.  Ultimately, that makes it worth a listen.  And another couple listens to help it grow on you, even when a country singer is featured.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love the kitten puzzles. There's plenty of sizes, and you can rotate the pieces! You get 3 free packs of puzzles when you download.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it ok besides that it freezes a lot and that you have to buy gems. it also wants you to log into you facebook and twitter account.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|In the first place, this is not a comedy, as advertised.  It's a soap.  Worse, it's a politically correct and utterly superficial soap.  Yes, the acting is marvelous, and so is the directing.  The music, however, is irritating, and the script is sheer trash.  Reading the warm reviews is most depressing, for one realizes how shallow our culture is, believing that life is about having a good time, especially if this means sex. And if you're an oldie, you can still have a lot of fun in the sack. Homosexuals too.  This is right out of CBS daytime or HBO anytime.  Sad.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Sharp Objects was a solid read.  The main character is slightly hard to love, but Gillian does make you like her by the end of the book.  I liked the ending, did not see that coming.
B004UAKAE2|4.0|This is a absolute marvelous theatrical work on TV.  I wish more current shows TV could improve to meet this 40 year old standard. I can not say enough good about this drama, so many others have said it better.<br />But, I am just wondering why Amazon streaming does not have the closed captions?<br />We have Amazon Prime, but are wondering if it is really worth the price, since we already have Netflix which does have closed captioning.  I have started to notice a lot of Amazon shows do not have CC. This is very discouraging especially since we are getting older and listening to the British accent can at times be frustrating..therefore -1 star.  Oh well, if you hearing is excellent then you will be amazed at the breath and fluidity of this TV show. Easy to get \\"hooked\\" and you will not regret it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grishom never disappoints.  His story lines are strong, real and hold your interest. You can be sure there will be a twist and as many books as you may read you will not see it coming.  It is a page turner so be prepared to sit up all ni8ght reading.  His chapters are short and each one leaving you wanting to turn the page immediately.  You will!  Male or female reader, youg or an older reader, there is something thaty relates to all of our lives and we are rootiung for the hero. Also gives you a keener insight into the law as well as the lawyers and prosecutors.  Court room settings are vivid but then this writer is a lawyer by profession so they should be! Keep your books coming.
B0080OJBQW|5.0|I have listened to this album many times since I purchased it.  So much music these days is so homogenized that it is a thrill to listen to an album where each track is a stand-alone work but each song flows nicely into the next.  There are tracks that, to me, sound like there is some old-school 80's influence (I hear some Prince and Rick Springfield).  There are others that are cutting-edge, new and contemporary with Adam's unique style and skill.  I highly recommend this album.  I know I have certainly enjoyed it.  Adam Lambert is such a great (very underrated) artist.  I hope he releases a new one soon!! [[ASIN:B007ZZ3RI0 Trespassing (Deluxe Version)]]
B005LAIHRC|1.0|For a musical to succeed you need at least two ingredients : good music and good choreography.<br /><br />You see a better choreography in a mediocre Bollywood than in this film.<br /><br />Music is ok but the cast is very bad.  They have cast a bimbo with a vulgar voice as the heroine.  Whenever she starts to sing, you want to shout : STFU.<br /><br />Cruise does some of the most the unlaughable stints in this film.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Although I missed this series of television, I caught it afterward on VCR and then bought the series on Blu-ray so that I could re-watch it again at my leisure.  It stands as one of my all-time favorite science fiction series.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Enjoying the stories which seem to be in story order (rather than order written). Great value, when considering low price and reading time from so many stories.
B007PM218K|5.0|Although it cannot hold a candle to the Steinbeck novel itself, this movie does a genuinely good job of capturing the plight of Americans caught between a drought and starvation.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|seems the Fire version was just glued together, with little regards to quality ambition. One example: it can only be used in portrait view. The screen does not turn with the device. A feature so ubiquitously available, Flipboard developers didn't think to implement screen turn on tilt on this version.
B005NACYQU|4.0|The story is cleverly crafted and told with great narrative skills. It does grip you from the very start. And even if the plot is somewhat predictable the characters are interesting enough to want to keep reading. I very much liked the idea of linking the power of the gods to how much people still believed in them (a theme Terry Pratchett has used several times in his Discworld series) and how ancient gods have to adapt to fit into the American belief system. The surprise endings are little extras after the story is finished. They feel like finding extra chocolates in the box after you think you finished them all. If you like a fantasy, horror (mild), sci-fi (low-tech), suspense type of story this one is recommended.
B004JK61K0|5.0|to be clear: all email programs on android can have issues, with some phones or tablets, with some servers, with some email providers. yet k-9 has been more stable for me than other programs. very glad to get it on my kindle fire HD.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|What can I say? It's fun! I should take a star away because of the time I spend playing the game instead of being productive. HaHa
B00285K1KE|3.0|First, this is probably not a film for anyone who wants the more recent, kinetic and superficial movies that Marvel Studios has been putting out of the Spiderman/Thor variety.  Ang Lee's film is paced much slower and has a fairly long setup before Bruce Banner ever transforms.  My biggest complaint with the story is that Lee makes it unnecessarily complicated by piling on too many issues and conflicts--civilian scientists vs. the military and military industrial complex, beauty and the beast, father-son, birth child / adoption and genetically modified organisms / medical research--and most are not sorted out by the movie's end.  The GMO / medical research added a nice twist to the story, but Lee just drops it in the movie's last shoot 'em up / smash 'em up third.  The film also needed some editing to cut the run-time down.  If you can put up with the slow pace and the actual raising of serious issues in the first half--which apparently some Marvel fans can't--this is an entertaining film.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I have really enjoyed this epic show. Very well done and very compelling! I want more!!!<br /> Thanks for the show!
B008K7RGA2|5.0|I thought this production was very good.  I am not an opera expert, or a video expert.  I am just an average person who enjoys music of all kinds.<br />I thought the people did a great job and the voices were awesome in my opinion.  May not be perfect.....but what is?  Enjoy it if you purchase it.<br />I liked it enough to watch it more than 1 time.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|What else is there to review. I thought it was a good flick with some awesome action scenes. This movie has had a lot of negative feedback regarding the &#34;bad acting&#34; by the SEALS. Honestly, I never noticed it first time thru.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone that likes good realistic action movies
0547884591|5.0|If you are a curious person who loves learning new skills, this is an absolute must-read. Even if you aren't into cooking at all, but are looking to learn ANYTHING (i.e. become a better basketball player, learn a new language, learn the guitar, whatever) you will get the insights from one of the very best when it comes to learning how to do, doing, and then sharing what he is learned (and that of course is Tim).<br /><br />Yes, you will walk away with some fantastic recipes for food, but the real recipe in the book is the step-by-step process for learning how to learn and master anything.

B002JIEYLW|5.0|I'm a huge Sabbath fan since being a teenager. None of their albums(except the 1st one) got any type of great production and so don't expect any miracles from this re-master. Yes, it's an improvement but really it's the same record as released in 1972. So if you're looking for vintage Sabbath from Ozzy years, can't go wrong there- buy the remaster vs the standard version that maybe a couple of bucks less. I also picked the Sanctuary records remasters of Sabotage and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath which are awesome.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love it! It's got everything I look for in a movie. Fun, Action, Excitement and a storyline that holds together well enough.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|If you are on the fence as to whether or not to get this one, go ahead and pull the trigger! It's a good one!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I don't think this is one of Grisham's best books.  I found myself bored, it didn't hold my interest like most of his books have.  Maybe I just found the con too unbelievable, I'm not sure.  I just know I didn't care that much for this one.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Overall I thought this movie was very well done.  The only problem I could see was the story line itself was dated, knowing what we know about Mars and space.  The screenplay should have been modified to make it more believable.  They could have used a totally fictional planet and in that way open up any possibility.  John Carter himself was inconsistent with his abilities throughout the movie.  He could leap astounding distances and swing huge boulders around, but when fighting one of the natives he seemed weak.  His unique abilities didn't jive with what was going on around him.  The bottom line is that the story taken as a whole was good, the special effects were fantastic, and in the end I did care about the main characters.
1451696191|5.0|Great GREAT book.  I hope that people purchase the book and the movie.  Both are very inspiring and interesting.  WONDERFUL!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Okay so this game is not exactly eye candy but decent. Fun and challenging overall good flight sim for a mobile device plus it was free it was on amazon free app of the day. I first seen the app but did not want  spend money on it then the next day there it was for free!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|good action, page turner. a good summer read. Moves quickly, very little down time in a compact story. not too complicated..
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not as good as the first three. Felt like it dragged on a bit. But definitely leaves you hanging! Can't wait for Martin's next masterpiece.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Judging by the trailer, I didn't expect to like Prometheus that much but there was more of a story than i thought there'd be. There are still quite a few unanswered questions at the end, but maybe more intelligent people than me didn't think so.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|BREAKING BAD is maybe the most addictive show on TV now with the possible exception of THE WALKING DEAD.  I watched the three previous seasons on DVD and tore into season 4 as soon as the set arrived from Amazon.  It did not disappoint as the story of cancer stricken chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine cook Walter White spiraled even further out of control.<br /><br />From the opening episode, Box Cutter, that resolves season 3's cliffhanger to the final confrontation with drug kingpin/chicken franchise owner, Gus Fring in the season ending episode, Face Off, the tension is non stop as it is ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels. Watching these characters stew in a hell of their own making makes for terrific drama.  Everyone is back for the ride: Walter, Jesse, Skylar, Hank, Mike, Marie, Gus, Walter Jr. Saul, and even nasty old Uncle Tio, who plays a very significant part in the action before the season is done.<br /><br />Impossible as it seems, Walter's life becomes even more complicated this season: he's increasingly on thin ice with Gus; his partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, is starting to have divided loyalties; wife Skylar is buying a car wash as a cover to launder all the money Walt's meth making as brought in and trying to help her shifty former boss dodge the IRS at the same time; and his DEA agent brother in law, Hank, is sniffing at Gus's trail and getting closer to the laundry that houses Walt and Jessie's meth lab.  At every turn, Walter is finding himself in ever more desperate straits.<br /><br />And the viewer is left with the question first posed back in the very first episode: is Walter White a good man forced by dire circumstances to do bad things or was he an evil man all along, whose dark nature was liberated by his own very bad choices? There's no definitive answer in Season 4 for me, but the final image of the season ender will make up the mind of many viewers.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter; he literally makes us feel this character's rage, panic and sheer hell bent determination in every line of dialogue and smallest gesture.  But all high praise to Aaron Paul as Jesse, Anna Gunn as Skylar, Dean Norris as Hank; Bob Odenkirk as Saul, Jonathon Banks as Mike, Mark Margolis (who does it all with his eyes) as Uncle Tio, and certainly to Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring, the perfect embodiment of ice cold evil.  Because of these great actors, we feel we know their characters much better then they know themselves.  And let's not leave out the fine writing and directing.<br /><br />Is BREAKING BAD a scathing commentary on the decline of the middle class or a 21st Century film noir?  Let the viewer make up their own mind,  For me, it's the kind of riveting drama that movies and regular network television don't seem to want to provide anymore.  Just watch episode 10, titled Salud, and you'll see what I mean.  I so enjoy watching series like this on DVD where I can devour multiple episodes in one sitting instead of having the network dole out one show a week at a time.
B005IQZB14|3.0|It was ok, but got tired of hearing about her mother dying. Mothers die all the time and people do not use it as an excuse to do some of the things she did.
B003UM6MPC|5.0|I loved the episode and therefore music, glad they made a musical episode. I was glad to add it to my collection.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Stupid,but that is what stupid people want and will buy. I certainly will not purchase the next book in the series.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|My son requested this for his birthday, I enjoyed watching it so much with him that I bought the series for my husband and I.<br />I would recommend the series.  It is rather violent but great none the less.
B007V65R54|4.0|Overall this is a good book with valuable insights.  It does provide more about baseball and poker than I care to know, and I would like to see more mathematical foundation, but understand it's aiming for a popular audience.

B0007MWZEK|2.0|I have purchased this item 3 times now.  Shame on me! When it works it does the job quite well. The problem is it doesn't work for very long.  Either it breaks or the battery dies.  Either way, you spend more money on something that has a life expectancy of something less than 6 months with any type of steady use.  I would actually pay a little more for it if it was built to last. Look elsewhere or plan to replace 2X a year or more.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book gives not just the historical but the human view of Lincoln.  It shows his wit, intelligience, compassion and political savvy that made him one of our greatest presidents.  A read I just could not put down! So much better than the movie that Spielberg based from this book.  A must read for anyone wanted to understand what it takes to run our government

B008HK3XYK|4.0|I bought the kindle fire to take on a trip abroad and I have been very happy with it.  I downloaded several movies on it which have played well.  The screen is small but adequate.  I downloaded several books on it which I have been reading.  The wifi works well and I also downloaded some apps which worked well.<br />The only complaint that I have is that the screen gets fngerprints on it very easily and they interfere with viewing stuff and it needs to be wiped off a lot.<br />Maybe it needs some kind of anti glare anti smudge screen protector to keep the fingerprints off or less visible?<br />All in all a great product at a good price and value-:)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great game. its a mental challenge and a lot of fun to play. each level increases the challenge.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|This is a great album. I love the artist and his raw truth in his lyrics. I will definitely keep up with his work.
0316223239|2.0|It took me a while to finish this book. I didnt care for it at all. It was a bit annoying reading it through a five year old's eyes. Intellectually I think it was clever and well written but for enjoyment it just didn't do it for me. And that whole give me some thing freaked me out.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game has been everything that we had hoped. My son just loves playing it. Great job on the game!
B00914JWSW|3.0|Barbra was right to shelve most of these as they were not up to her unreal standard.<br />It was still a nice album, but as I said she has done so much better in the past.
B004JHYRYU|4.0|Fascinating and horrifying story of relationships and living in the residue of war. Historical events and  situations that occurred in WWII are admirably incorporated into the fictional aspects of the book. Beautifully written.
0547884591|5.0|The Four Hour Chef is a tome and it deserves to be devoured. I completely recommend getting the hard copy as you will want to thumb back through again and again. Not least because of the coffee table beauty of all the colour photos, but there is also a 2 month lesson calendar that you can fill in when practicing your dishes. But this book is not just about cooking. Oh no. Even if you hate cooking you should still consider buying this book! Who doesn't want to learn how to become world class at a skill in record time? I did languages at university, it took me four years and now I can learn a language in three months! Damn it, why didn't this book exist years ago. I'd be 3 years and 9 months ahead of myself! Buy it now!
B008MEM24S|4.0|Nothing is perfect, but this comes close.  It makes you think, and there is logic needed.  It is a great game for adults, and fun for older children.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|I almost did not purchase this DVD due to a review I read claiming this was not as good as all the others I have purchased.  So glad that I listened to my heart.<br />Even though they only have 3 singers now instead of the original 5 there is no lack in the beautiful harmony we have always heard and loved. It always amazes me how they can continue to find new girls that blend so well with the previous singers.  Lisa Lambe is no exception.  She is just as wonderful a singer as Lisa and Chloe.<br />The costumes are outstanding as usual.  The set itself is great and love the different touches they have brought to us this time.  The bagpipes are always a favorite and the extra dancing is a nice touch.  The use of the childrens choir in \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\"  is wonderful.<br />The filming is clear and on the same level as all the other DVD's have been.  I would buy this again in a heart beat.  Can not wait until they make the next one.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I hate modern R&B. Chris Brown (ugh), Trey Songz, Usher...it's all the same crap to me. The Weeknd is something different. He sings interesting things, unlike most R&B stars who sing about how great their women are, nights in the club, etc. I started listening to The Weeknd for about a year now. I'm so glad I can purchase this now for a physical copy, though it would've been cool for this to be on vinyl. These are great albums. You have to hear to believe.

B005LCYR7Y|5.0|This book isn't what I expected from Stephen King, but that isn't a bad thing at all! It's a story about time travel, and it's brilliant. I haven't been able to put it down since I started! The author does a brilliant job of weaving the plot together and it really does not disappoint!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|it kept failing to download. so i turned off my wifi and turned it back on and it downloaded right the next time. so if your having trouble try that. now im off to play!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Continues the high standard of this entertaining series.  A great read!  I recommend new readers of Mr. Child, begin with book #1,
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Good show for relaxing. Character Developemental gets better and better, Bad Robot Productions are usually safe bets. Sometimes stretches credulity but you find yourself somehow able to believe.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Virtual City - very interesting game (for my mind). I play long time and very like it. So, I think, that you'll like this game too.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This was the first movie I went to with friends (without parents). The movie was taunt, suspensful and had a few laughs. Donald Pleasence gave a riviting performance as the doctor who knows what is happening and no one will belive him. The original score by John Carpenter to this day gives me the heebie jeebies!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Found it hard to put down, once I started reading. The descriptive text makes you feel like you're there in the story.<br />Definitely recommended this book, loved it

0525958002|5.0|You won't be able to put it down!  John Taylor tells an honest and often raw tale of life in the limelight and that fame is not all it's cracked up to be.  Told with genuine heart and sometimes cold detail, this book will make you think and get you to care.

The cars are one of the best bands to ever come from England!Their music was/and still is refreshing/new (for the 70's)style wise/superb licks/fantastic backbeat/and an outstanding synthesizer arraignment!Off the charts... My only dislike was and is; \\"Never\\"separate \\"Movin' in Stereo/All Mixed Up\\"...Nearly the best track mix of a song leading into another! Peace~Out music lovers and never let the Music die.................

B0070NSPCU|3.0|I enjoyed this book and would have liked it more if there was less long winded dialog. It was had to follow in parts where it goes back and forth to different times in the main character's life.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I was so hooked on Pretty Little Liars by the time that I finished watching seasons 1 and 2 on Netflix that I had to get the first part of the third season from Amazon - couldn't wait....and loved it!!
0345803485|1.0|Well, I wasn't expecting much, and I got even less.  I don't care how much BDSM/WTF this book contains.  It's as titillating as the periodic chart and as mature as a Happy Meal.  Anyone who has also read The Devil Wears Prada will recognize the shallow twenty-something narrator, which for me destroys any kind of eroticism.  I wanted Christian Grey to meet a Captain Ahab kind of end, but unfortunately I was aware that this is the first in a trilogy.  Look, it takes a tremendous effort to write a book, so I have to give James a certain amount of credit.  But her erotic magnum opus reads more like a Judy Blume book (and I mean no offense to Blume--she actually did write for young adults after all).  But why should the author care?  She's as rich as Croesus because of this crap.  Sigh.

B00000637V|4.0|When BERLIN was released, I felt compelled to crack at least a little wise and assert that it seemed Lou Reed had been spending a lot of time at the movies--cuz the storyline here sounded like nothing so much as LADY SINGS THE LAST TANGO AT THE CABARET.  OK, so I was being snarky,  but there's actually some truth there.  Lou's fans knew better than to expect him to produce standard glitter fare, and few were surprised that he followed up the commercially successful TRANSFORMER with a depressingly sordid tale of starcrossed lovers in the starcrossed capital of Europe's heartland.  It wasn't so much the sensibility or subject matter that threw some his fan base in to a tizzy.  It was the sound!<br /><br />Lou Reed would later be labeled the \\"Godfather of Punk\\" and the \\"Grandfather of Grunge,\\" but on BERLIN, he enlisted the production and arrangement talents of Bob Ezrin, who'd helped to shape Alice Cooper's sound a few years before (and who would continue to do so for many years thereafter).  He hadn't done anything quite as lush as the production work on BERLIN, however.  And it was certainly new territory for Lou himself.  Urban rock aficionados, of which there were one or two even then, complained about the overly fussy arrangements.  My own theory is that Lou had heard what John Cale had worked out for Nico's solo records and wanted some of that elaborate baroque action for himself.<br /><br />But he was too proud to ask his former bandmate to do the job, so Ezrin was the next best choice.  Just a theory, you understand, but a credible one, I'd say.<br /><br />And why not?  Lou Reed had recorded with Rick Wakeman and various members of Yes on his very first solo record.  Apparently, he had an art rock bent as well as an ARTY bent.  He even first composed what was to become this album's title track as a more extensive and extended rock ballad on that eponymous debut.<br /><br />In fact, much of what was supposed to be a cohesive \\"rock opera\\" (a term I'm sure he must have rejected)was recycled material from the even earlier Velvet era.  Now artists are allowed to re-cycle, just like anybody else.  Still, if you're trying to tell a story in song-cycle format, you need to do at least one of two things (preferably both): 1. provide enough detail in the texts of the songs themselves so that the listener can follow the story line, OR 2., provide a separate narrative on the lyric sheet.<br /><br />Lou Reed did neither of these things. Most of whatever I knew of the storyline came from reading press releases (\\"The story takes place in the youth ghetto of contemporary Berlin,\\" \\"Expatriate American falls in love with German woman, but they descend into a whirlpool of drug-induced madness, violence, depravity and suicide.\\")  Quite a tale--potentially--but it's never fleshed out either on record or in the supplemental materials.<br /><br />And the first couple of songs don't even seem to relate to that sketchy outline.  \\"Lady Day\\" really does seem to reflect something of the Billie Holiday legend, except that we're talking (maybe?) Berlin?  Is this really supposed to be our introduction to Caroline?  Does she sing in bars?  And while \\"Men of Good Fortune\\" is really as socially conscious a rant as Lou Reed would have allowed himself in '73, is this comparison-contrast between the impotent rich youth and the equally impotent poor supposed to echo something of our protagonist's personal and moral crises?  Are we to assume that our narrator belongs to one social group or the other? (I'm guessing he's poor, if that's the case, but who can say for sure?)  It may just be an anomaly on the record.<br /><br />But I trust you'll forgive me if I insist that the actual story doesn't even begin until half way through the original first side of the album.  We're introduced to Caroline on track 4, but all we really find out are that she's SAYING a lot of things--mostly, not very nice things--to and about our narrator.  Over the course of the next several pieces, we garner that the couple fights intensively, they do copious quantities of drugs, she cheats on him (but maybe what really bothers our hero is that HE didn't get a chance to make it with the interloper--someone with Lou's favorite name, JIM--himself.  The kids wind up getting taken away (a break for them),  and a despondent Caroline kills herself.<br /><br />Yeah, it's bleak enough all right.  And I suppose it works as well as any other attempt at a rock narrative from the era (TOMMY, anyone?).  Still, I would have hoped that as literate a songwriter as Lou Reed would have provided us with a comprehensible story line.  The accompanying booklet DOES have a lot of photos or Caroline, the anonymous hero, and, uh, Jim (I assume).  That gives us a little grounding that the lyrics do not.  Still, you have to wonder, just who ARE these people?<br /><br />When it comes to BERLIN, I remain divided (20 years after the wall came down).  On the one hand, I DO find it an oddly compelling record.  On the other hand--for a supposed magnum opus--it still seems a little thrown together to me.  This was the era when Lou Reed's lyrics took on a defiantly slapdash quality.  He'd come up with a great line like, \\"How do you think it feels to always make love by proxy,\\" and mate it with something as quintessentially dumb as, \\"How do you think it feels to live like a wolf and foxy...\\"  Yikes, that's bad.<br /><br />I used to get a little miffed over sloppiness like that ( it's hardly the sole example on the record--and it was all over the previous record).  But once I decided for myself who these characters were and what their lives were like, I did start to fall for this record's sinister charms after all.  It took a while, but I decided that it was definitely NOT the disaster that some of the critics thought it was at the time.<br /><br />But I also don't think it's Lou's masterpiece exactly either.  But it IS compelling.  The rap now seems to be that the record has aged well.  I'd say that's fair.al pieces, we garner that the couple fights intensively, they do copious quantities of drugs, she cheats on him (but maybe what really bothers our hero is that HE didn't get a chance to make it with the interloper--someone with Lou's favorite name, JIM--himself.

B009P5S11G|5.0|Rihanna's new album, Unapologetic, has been pretty much very long-awaited. However, it's pretty funny that she released it this year, still promoting singles from her last album. Like Birthday Cake and Cockiness. Still, Rihanna marks her way to the top with this album. When I first heard the snippets, I did think that it wasn't like how I wanted it to be, but maybe it's because I wasn't so used to them yet, it all had to grow on me. But, I'll say that it's definitely worth a buy.<br /><br />Many highlights of the album include, of course, \\"Diamonds\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"What Now\\", the lengthy-pop song, \\"Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary\\", the controversial duet with Chris Brown, \\"Nobody's Business,\\", \\"No Love Allowed,\\" and the final song of the album, \\"Lost in Paradise.\\"
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This is enjoyable book probably won't win any literary awards, but it's a fun read filled with appealing characters and enjoyable anectdotes.  I recommend it as a great choice for the bus, beach or terminal.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A mystery about a wife gone missing on her fifth anniversary captivated me near the very beginning as her husband says, \\"...and that was the fifth lie I told the police...\\"
B0076794IO|2.0|I just don't quite know where to start with The Expats. A great idea, let down a bit by some over-done writing and inconsistent characterisation - but the really dodgy part is the way it's been structured.<br /><br />There is a relatively straight-forward and entertaining story here about an ex-CIA agent and a major white collar crime, but you wouldn't know it to read the book. The timeline is all over the place, with little or no indication of when many of the scenes are set until very late into them. This is just plain frustrating. It might work if you read it all in one go on a beach, but I didn't. I read a little each evening and I very quickly got tired of trying to keep track, and gave up and went with the flow... skipping a lot just to get to the end to find the resolution.<br /><br />The other problem is that the book lacks big tense scenes of the kind that a good thriller needs - think Jack Reacher going into battle at the end of a Lee Child book. Chris Pavone seems unable to hit these heights, and I can't help thinking that he's tried to hide this deficiency with the convoluted narrative.<br /><br />If you do read it, when you get to the end think back through the major events and you'll see that there's a potentially great thriller here, but written in a single timeline from multiple viewpoints - loads of tension could have been extracted by letting the reader know more than the characters, with a lot of excitement to be had watching these people car crash into disaster.<br /><br />Or not. And boy don't get me started on that ending, what a let-down... but I won't spoil it for you, just in case I haven't put you off!
B009S8QCIY|5.0|Stereo and Mono cuts of the original album. Plenty of live tracks. Previously unreleased tracks. Alternative versions and mixes.  There is nothing not to like here.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This, of course, the second in the trilogy. There are some twists and turns that you won't expect, but that is what is keeping me turning the pages. It is fantastic. I haven't finished it yet, but I can asure you, I will read the third.
B0046ECJBY|4.0|I found the book surprisingly far less self serving than the normal Kissinger.  He lays out what to me is an honest appraisal of Western lack of understanding of Eastern thinking and how that led to several missteps along the way, including his own.  I have been to China several times and negotiated contracts there.  I wish I had this level of understanding while doing that.  It helps one from the west better understand their point of view.  It is also quite open and honest about our misreading of the Soviet issues.  All in all, a good read.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Ellie Goulding has redefined pop music with this heartfelt and plaintive masterpiece. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys nuanced song-writing and emotional depth.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|The TubeMate YouTube Downloader has worked great and exceeded my expectations!!!  The majority of the videos I download are greater than an hour in length and I rarely experience a problem.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|Natalie grew up in Jamestown, NY, and I was one of the fortunate to watch and listen as she grew from her early beginnings with the Maniacs, often playing the Rusty Nail when I would come home from college on the weekends.  She was not yet old enough to be in a bar, so she had a chaperone, and always that beautiful voice.  I still see some of the Maniacs when I visit the hometown, but have seen little of Natalie since her mega rise to fame led her away.  She moved on, matured in many ways, and developed her phenomenal and unique voice (both figuratively and literally) for all the world to discover.<br /><br />This recording is nothing less than genius.  I cannot stop listening to it, and I feel genuinely moved by the power of her mastery with the lyrics and arrangements. I am alive again 35 years down the road, and know that I have been blessed in this life by the sound of purity so rare and so delightful!
B009RX7WTI|5.0|i didn't start watching this show until the 5th season...love it so much i have all the dvd's in the set and naturally had to add this one...i can't wait for the 10th season to come out on dvd...this series gets better each season!!!  great show/dvd
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Not what I was expecting, but oh, so good.  More pop than country, but true Swift fans will love it.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game. Its really random, but really fun.  It is a time waster. Really fun.  Gets u thinking a little bit.
0425263916|5.0|This is just as good as fifty!!! You will read this book in a day or less, Cross will keep you flipping
B009LK6JS2|2.0|Map does not zoom = no s.a.  Gear cycling unknown.  No hook. Dumb music.  Needs tons of development.  Developer should use a better english translator.  Glad I didn't buy it.
0425263908|5.0|Another page turner..Cross will keep you on the edge of your seat..this book is great..Love it. Power, control, passion, love, all wrapped in one!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. The last book kind of had a strange ending, but I guess that was to add to the suspense. Some parts of the trilogy were predictable but that can be said for most novel that come in series. Overall I enjoyed it which for me is rare because I am not a big fan of fiction. If you are looking for a page turner this is a great read.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|the greatest songwriting album since revolver! began again the best song and country track!best pop song &#34; i will never ever get back together&#34;
B0063IH60K|3.0|Fun,didn't care for ads! Solitaire cannot ever be done bad.  Would be better if it can be personalized some. but not bad for free app
B0031KE9C6|5.0|So far the episodes I have watched are good. Can't wait to see the rest then on to seasons 2 and 3
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|This is a great idea to zip through laps while perfecting my freestyle.  I did have to use nose plugs, which are recommended.  This is not at all like snorkeling.  While you only breathe through your mouth with both, it's possible with this to try to take air in through your nose, but you only get water.  Choked a lot during the first try, but once I adapted to it with nose plugs, I liked it.
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is a great movie!  It was a good price on here and in good condition when I received it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I HAD PROBLEMS ON RECIEVING MY REQUESTS.<br />THIS ONE CAME ALL WRIGHT.<br />HOPE YOU KEEP THIS SERVICE FOR THE FUTURE.<br />THEY DO A GOOD JOB.<br /><br />THANKS
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I would recommend this book to middle school or freshman high school English classes. It is easy reading, at 22 mildly boring but relative  to someone in that age group.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book in less than two days.  I was captivated by the writing and message.  The story was beautifully written, capturing my imagination and giving me a vivid image of the journey of Pi.  I couldn't wait to turn the next page and reveal what happened next.  In the end I didn't know which story to believe, the entire thing is too compelling.  I do know what story I want to believe.  Just like any good piece of literature, my mind and soul has grown and I have become a better person by reading this work of art.  This book is quite a departure from my normal Science Fiction and Fantasy readings and I truly enjoyed the compelling nature of this voyage.  Thank you.
B009F1ZYCO|5.0|Awesome , no other words can describe the e<br />Memories that the cover, back and jacket art brought back. The tunes sound great. Worth the $ and the wait.

B009A9BF5G|2.0|LOVE LOVE Coldplay.  I went to their San Jose concert back in April.  The concert in this bluray was amazing and brings back memories when I saw them.<br /><br />However, the bluray quality SUCKS.  The video looks grainy.  This is isn't bits and pieces, but the entire video on the bluray looks bad.  Here I was thinking it was going to look absolutely fantastic in HD, but instead it's a huge let down.  That and sometimes it sounds like they muted, or lowered the sound of the audience.  That's so disappointing.  The audience is part of the experience, no idea why they think it was beneficial to lower the sound of the audience.<br /><br />Also, there's a lot of lights flashing everywhere and video fades.  If only the video could have focused more on the band itself playing and no so much on flashy lights and audience shots.  Oh and what's weird is that the bluray cover says \\"Violet Hill\\" is only on DVD, yet it's on the bluray?  Maybe they added the video last minute?<br /><br />I wish I could give it 5 stars, but unfortunately I can't :(
B0054JZC6E|3.0|purchased from amazon for my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />aren't very exciting and graphics are ho-hum.<br /><br />not all games are even worth playing. some are too difficult; others are boring.<br />an okay time-killer (doctors office, waiting for the bus, etc) but, generally dull.

B009FZFONO|5.0|My favorite season by far. All episodes I have seen are very intense and dramatic and keep you on the edge of your seat. Zombies also come out more often this season which i love because it is called The Walking Dead.
B001EBV0NA|4.0|I watch this at least once a momnth. I can't get enough of it. when my kids are old enough I will share the hauntings with them.
1400052173|2.0|The book could have been written in 100 pages or less.  There is also quite a bit of less than full truth in the story.  It was a book club pick otherwise I would not have purchased it.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|This movie came out at the perfect time for me. My kids are 6 and this movie showed them how to mend what pride has broken. Awesome movie my number 1 disney movie.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong solitaire keeps your mind going. It would be better if there were limited reveals per game. Some challenge is removed when the game automatically shuffles and reveals when there are no more moves. Mindless fun.
B007MDB548|5.0|Another wholesome movie that all the family enjoys.  As an older parent of an 8 year old, all can enjoy these Disney series movies and they are timeless.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Whether you loved the old Battlestar Galactica series or the newer series, then this complete series collection is for you!  My husband and I have watched episodes from this series several times over.  We highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't already seen the series, and also for those who miss it as much as we do.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|The movie was a little slow and could have used more action.  I kept wanting more but it never seemed to get there.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 4 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 4.5 / 5<br />mib 3 bluray is fun to watch, with great audio and video - 4.5 / 5<br />lots of laughs and a good storyline, a lot better than part 2 and on par with the first<br />one.<br />video quality was sharp and vibrant, as well as the soundstage being very clear and well<br />played throughout my entire home theatre area.<br />good addition to your collection.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Good book, couldn't put it down. Fast read, as always with John's books. Can't wait to see what he does next.

B009HQ9UHC|3.0|can't complain, kids luv it. Don't see any difference in quality from free nexus 7 version to this one on Google play.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 4.5 / 5<br />video- 5 / 5<br />audio- 5 / 5<br />just finished watching the bluray ,and both the video and audio simply rocks.<br />movie though is a toss up between the dark knight and tdk-rises for the best in the trilogy,although i'm leaning a bit to the dark knight. guess i'll have to watch tdk-rises a couple more times to really make up my mind.<br />video quality is really defined and crisp, but there is a bit of over yellowing to some scenes.<br />compared to the bluray, the dvd quality is really crappy.<br /><br />it's a definite must to get this bluray to complete your collection.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is awsome i love the  fact that i have ascess to see what my battery percentage  is i love you battery HD U R AWSOME!!!!!!!!!
B005LAII1C|3.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie -<br />movie- 3.5 / 5<br />video- 4.5 / 5<br />audio- 4.5 / 5<br />just finished watching TED on bluray and was a bit disappointed with the movie.<br />billed as a comedy/romance, it lacked a bit on the laughs and the storyline was a bit<br />too mellow for me.<br />the video and the audio were both 4.5 /5<br />maybe if i watch it a couple more times it will grow on me.<br />still you may want to add the bluray to your collection as it's quality blows the dvd version out of the water.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grandson plays this on his phone, but he likes it better on my Kindle.  If your child plays this game on your kindle, be sure your done with your kindle before you pass it on to them, you won't get it back.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love love this! I also loved the 50 Shades trilogy too! Don't compare these, just love them all! Can't wait for entwined in you to be released!
B009DJB9HC|5.0|I really liked their first album so I bought this one without hearing any samples first. It doesn't disappoint. I don't think I like quite as much as the first one but it's still a great album.
B008F2AKUA|5.0|I down loaded this CD as I went to see him in concert a couple weeks ago....LOVED THEM!  This was a great purchase!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I came upon these guys while listening to the Avett Brothers radio on Pandora.  I loved them from the start.  The harmonies in their blended instruments as well as their voices (at times) is very appealing.  If you are a fan of alt-folk-rock in a hearty form, then  you will love this album and this band.  highly recommend.
B007N8RULO|5.0|A very addictive game. I am writing a review because they have an offer right now where if u write one you can get five days without ads.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Whether you love a zombie fest, or just enjoy a superb drama with great characters and story, this is the show for you.  This is without a doubt my favorite show on television.  Don't miss an episode; start from the beginning.
0547884591|5.0|I got an early copy of the 4-Hour chef. It's a great read, and provides a lot of value beyond just how to cook. Chapter 1, in particular, is extremely insightful and outlines his approach to learn anything. Definitely worth the read.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|I am a piano teacher in Merrimack, New Hampshire and teach several advanced high school players.  Our favorite pianist to hear and be inspired is Lang Lang. I recently drove to New York City to hear him play at Carnegie Hall and he was amazing to see and hear in person. We purchased a DVD of his performance in Vienna and he autographed it. This was awesome!!!! The Chopin Album is wonderful!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|great movie to watch over the weekend, my kids liked it and found it to be better than they expected.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|Was very excited to see Angry Birds Star Wars downloaded it but it will not open. I uninstalled it, and tried downloading it again, still will not open. I uninstalled again, reinstalled and tried to open it right from the download page, still will not open. works fine on my sons tablet, but not mine. sorry, I was really looking forward to playing it.
B0028K31CE|5.0|Love the whole CD. Very creative music. I do appreciate it. Need to repurchase some of his other CDs.  I played the others too much.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is really a good movie. Will watch it over and over. Great acting and story, of course. Would recommend as a must see....at least once!!
6305428042|5.0|I have this on cassette and so glad to finally have it on DVD. It just seems to me that some of this movie was cut. Maybe it's just me. Love this movie.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I was stubborn about watching it during the first three seasons but now wish I hadn't. It is a great show.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|All the hype about this book was a big let down. I was disappointed in this book.  It became boring to me.  Couldn't wait to finish it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game rocks. fills up all my free time thanks again my son loves to play the game as well
1416562605|5.0|The title for my review would describe with brevity on what I experienced. This is an exhilarating read. It talks to about the real India, the India of the corrupt, the poor, the downtrodden. The grandma character is an instant classic. Through Balram Halwai, the author has exposed the real undercurrent of this nation which tends to believe itself to be a superpower. What country would be a superpower, unless it can provide a good standard of living for all it's people. Unfortunately India will remain so, for bribery runs in it's veins. Worth your time and money. Though I would suggest the used versions.
B000W7JWUA|1.0|Let me make this clear. Settlers of Catan is a great game, and that's why I ordered it from Amazon. However, the board quality is very bad ! The hexagon pieces that are arranged in between the board never stay in their place. The outer port boundary (trading ports) have to be connected together to make a hexagon in between (to fit the rest of the hexagon pieces). It was not only hard to connect those outer boundary pieces, it was also very difficult to place the hexagonal pieces in between this boundary. The horizontal profile of the pieces wasn't flat, and they weren't heavy, which meant that they were not easy to place and play the game. The pieces moved ALL THE TIME, and it got very irritating. We had to stick cello tape (transparent sticky tape) to make the pieces stick to the board, which is obviously not what you want to do with the board since you have to take the pieces apart in the end to store it until next time. I would've returned it, unfortunately some of the paper of one of the hexagonal piece tore off while I was carefully trying to take out the cello tape that. My friends, with whom I played the game, told me that their version of Catan has uch heavier pieces and flat boundary. Their pieces are thicker too. That way, they are easy to set on the table and do not move while you place your settlements. I would not buy this game again.<br /><br />I recommend the travel version, its much better in terms of quality, just smaller (and cheaper, costs 20$ on Amazon). The only downside with travel version is that the extension packs (5 to 6 players) and other such extras are not available for it.[[ASIN:B00028X3ZO Settlers of Catan - Portable Edition]]
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I bought the game for my girlfriend and she seems to like it a lot. She says it's very suspenseful so that's always a plus. I think her only complaint was about the math involved but that's not something to deter from play. It's a game with multiple stories lines and ending so yeah I'd say get it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I had this app on my phone and I loved it!! Although on my phone it would glitch sometimes....I do like it better on my kindle and having a bigger screen helps a ton!!!
0062127241|4.0|As a fan of The Who and Pete Townshend, I bought this book immediately after it was released and looking forward to reading it. I've seen a lot of interviews with Pete (including the BBC Quadrophenia and Classic Albums Who's Next documentaries)and knew that if he wrote a memoir, it would be worth reading. This did not disappoint. When it all comes down to it, \\"Who I Am\\" tells you the truth about Townshend. The hellish childhood (including sexual abuse), the drugs, the adultery, the mental illness; the side we were all scared to see. But it also gives valuable insight into his creative process, as well as some fun stories about the band. If you are a fan, it's worth the read.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|If you like drama which also involves vampires, werewolves, witches and more of the supernatural, this series will probably speak to you.  Basically, the story lines are good and could work even without the supernatural overlay.  Mystery, intrigue, romance, drama, homicide, spirituality and more are in every show.  Great job, writers!!  And thank you.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I hope they keep this show going, it only gets better with age. Season 10 is as good if not better than previous seasons, they just seem to come up with better stories as time goes on.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|. . . it's no \\"Nightfly,\\" Fagen's seminal and first solo outing. Stylistically, it seems a bit lazy, with an unusual reliance on straight blues and even a tune written by someone else (!). Lots of okay tunes, but not a single one rising to the infectious, illuminative and creative level of \\"Walk Between the Raindrops.\\" With several tunes lamenting the coming of old age, it feels a bit creaky and sad. All in all, I'd say, for my taste, it's on a par with \\"Morph the Cat.\\"
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was recommended to me after I read a couple of other books.  I am enjoying reading it slowly and grasping every word.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|This was an interesting movie.  I love vampire movies.  It's a great twist on a history story.  Of course not true or is it?  LOL
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|We purchased this movie to watch before we actually take a Polar Express train ride they have in our area for the holiday season.  Our train ride is only going to be 1 hour long so won't be nearly the adventure shown in the movie, but it should be great.  We love the movie and will watch year after year.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I Love Bingo Blitz.  It works well on my Kindle Fire, very fast.  I like the different rooms.  I rated 4 stars because it would be nice if you could have the same functionality as when you play it on the computer.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This game is really fun I suggest you go to free flight and land and takeoff at the ground air base. Everything is great GET IT!!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Way too much detail and not enough action. He went on and on about Yemin and not enough about the confilct in tghat part of the country. Not up to his standards.
0812550706|5.0|I have returned to this book time and time again over the last decade. It is my all time favorite book. Not only is it easy to read, but it's a quick read with a great story.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Alot going on with chat (can be hidden thank goodness) and scores of other players...not needed in my opinion.  Without these the bingo cards could be larger which would be great!  Music is a little loud but v<br />Can be muted.  Overall enjoyable mindless fun.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Love this CD- especially her renditions of \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"The Night We Called it a Day\\"- highly recommend!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love love love love love these books!!! Their love gets more intense in this book and it has some twists
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This a book that reads very easily, the characters are very complex and rich, the storyline keeps you interested through the book, I read The Pillars of the Earth and A World Without End and I believe this book is comparable in terms of entertainment.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was awesome! It started off a little slow but once it got going it kept going through all 3 books.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|The plot and story line where pretty bad, it was completely different from what I expected. The storyline was actually kind slow moving. The visuals were great, but I wish I had waited to borrow this from library for free instead of playing $3.99.<br />I watch a lot of animation and cartoons and the story line and plot here was one of the worst I've seen. I liked some the characters in this movie, but I didn't like the way the plot was executed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|love love love love love these books!!! I like the ending, intense passionate love story that anyone could get into.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book helped me tremendously. It went into detail about each aspect and explained all topics well. I highly recommend this book.
B008NABUU8|5.0|This is the best bridge builder game out there.  The gameplay is easy and intuitive.  Can't wait for more levels!
1423124111|5.0|What a Delightful Tome, full of wonderful Disneyland memories. I've wanted a book on the gorgeous Attraction Posters for some time now.<br /><br />Disney love aside, this is a Textbook in Color Theory and Graphic Design. This collection is Art with a Capitol A. It's a large format and a very dense 144 color pages.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me are the designs of Bjorn Aronson who did most of the early posters. Crisp, appealing, and ingenious.<br /><br />It's also nice to see Attraction Posters from other Disney Parks around the World. I'm not sure if this book contains every single Poster Image created for the Theme Parks, but if not, it has to be close.<br /><br />The written text is interesting and informative without taking up too much artwork real estate. It also organizes the book well by chapter and Tony Baxter's great introduction provides his usual knowledge and insight.<br /><br />If you are someone who collects the $35.00 framed Attraction Posters, I should point out that many of the full page illustrations in this book are around the same size. Let's just say, I bought more than one copy....and I probably could have gotten a third in the case of some tough choices about which page side I liked better.

B00475AYJQ|4.0|I started the series without knowing it wasn't completed. Ugh- I have no patience!  I cannot wait for the final book and find out what happens.  I'm not such a fantasy fan, and this was like a &#34;grown up&#34; version of Harry Potter- (which I loved reading with my kids)  Definitely would recommend it to fantasy lovers.  It's different enough from HP to make it worth your while.  Keep writing!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|There was so much hoopla given to this book. It was poorly written and I felt like there was alot missing and that I wasted my time.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I had a hard time putting this one down.  If anyone asked me today what I would recommend (and I read a lot), this would be my first suggestion.  I love the historical novel genre and putting a little white girl in the middle of black slaves, as a slave, made for a very interesting twist.  Wish I could find more books of this caliber.

B0016PM722|2.0|The On/Off switch never worked, not once.  After installing the batteries the light saber turned on and I could not turn it off using the very cheap plastic on/off switch.  As others have mentioned, this light saber has the look and feel of a collector's item, but has some cheap elements such as the on/off switch that was obviously low-end plastic and that did not even move up and down.  So I returned the item.  It's too bad because the light saber looks great in the dark.

B000QE9ERK|1.0|I'll start with the good things about this film:<br /><br />1. It introduced me to the book The Dumas Club which is now on my TBR list. Although I didn't enjoy the film I'm still keen to read the book because it's apparently a literary thriller, which I love. These types of books are notoriously difficult to adapt to the screen as so much of their charm is in language.<br /><br />2. The cinematography was great. There are some beautiful scenes and images which established the mood for this type of film.<br /><br />3. The basic set-up was intriguing and had great potential.<br /><br />4. Johnny Depp is hot.<br /><br />Now for the negatives, which can be reduced to one word: plot.<br /><br />After setting up the storyline the plot begins to meander all over the place and by the end the whole thing has become farcical. None of the questions  raised are answered properly, we never know exactly who the mysterious blond girl is or if she's really working for Fargas at all. The ending is over the top, ridiculous, and very unsatisfying.

0345525558|5.0|Daisy for `innocence'; Geranium (oak leaf) for `true friendship'; Lavender for `mistrust'.  What would you say with a bouquet?  The author speaks to us through flowers.  She tells the story of `Victoria Jones', a child who was abandoned as a baby and raised in the foster care system.  Until Victoria meets `Elizabeth', her new foster mother, she has no idea of flowers and their language and no idea how to love or be loved.  And even still, Victoria bears the burden of secret that took away the one chance that she had at a good life.  Emancipated at the age of 18, Victoria uses her knowledge of flowers to speak to others and to help others speak for themselves.  This book is filled with heartbreak and hope.  A gift to the reader is a `dictionary' at the end of the book telling us what certain flowers are meant to mean.

B009GEFXLC|5.0|Drama, action, and comedy; you get all three in this show.  The mix varies from episode to episode, so there is plenty of variety.  The main characters are vibrant, but not extreme.  We enjoy the reruns, which is about the highest praise we can give.  There is both character and plot development as the series progresses, so you will want to initially watch them in order if possible.
0812979702|5.0|Excellent instructional book. After reading it, I ordered 2 more for my other  golf pals. Any one who plays golf will benefit after they read this book. Many great tips and easy to follow.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|As other reviewers have said, this game has a learning curve. Make sure you play through the 5 tutorial missions otherwise you will stall and crash and be quite frustrated.<br /><br />I just got it yesterday as the FAOTD, I think the graphics are nice and it runs smoothly on my LG G2X. I just did the tutorial mission and one other mission. I landed on a carrier! Perhaps it was unrealistically easy because I didn't have to worry about catching the arrestor cable with the tailhook and the flight deck was almost totally empty except for two planes tucked behind the \\"island\\".<br /><br />As far as I know, it is flight, takeoff, and landing practice only. I haven't seen any combat. I like the 3 different camera modes. It would be nice to allow looking to the sides or back when you are flying. I think you can pan the camera around when looking at a recorded video of your missions, but not during the actual missions.<br /><br />My impression is that I will enjoy this game as a nice way to relax after work or on a break.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great movie with a great message and a great soundtrack.  It has beautiful graphics and will really make you laugh out loud.  One of my all-time favorites.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan Boyle has an amazing voice that hasn't always been shown to its best advantage in previous CDs. In fact, her last CD was not very good. The voice was there, but the songs weren't.<br />This time, everyone involved got it right with one exception. I honestly don't care for her version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\\" That said, the rest of the selections are just wonderful. She breathes new life into such standard show tunes as \\"As Long as He Needs Me,\\" \\"The Winner Takes It all,\\" \\"Send in the Clowns,\\" \\"You'll Never Walk Alone,\\" and her version of \\"Memory\\" is terrific.<br />Susan gets some really good help on a couple of duets, \\"The Music of the Night\\" featuring the original Phantom, Michael Crawford and Donny Osmond has never sounded better than on \\"All I Ask of You.\\"<br />I hope the producers stick with this type of music in future CDs.
B00A9Q70Y4|5.0|At first I thought \\"oh great another stupid show about the end of the world\\"... well how wrong was I???  SO WRONG!!! I watched the first season and immediately got hooked.  The characters, the storyline, the walking dead... it ALL lures you in!!! Can't get enough of it!!!

B0084I9QI2|5.0|Great packaging. The original album sounds amazing, the second cd of unreleased music shows some how different bad might have sounded, plus you can tell how some tracks evolved in to other songs. The jewel is the live cd and DVD of the London wembley show. I was fortunate enough to have seen MJ on this tour and if your a mega fan or not it's truly a chance to see a real talent . The show is Michael , voice and the moves, there wasn't a need for an eloborate stage or a mass of dancers and effects .

1609611543|5.0|I found this book to be well written with a good balance of deduction and science, backed up by case studies and research presentations that at times are shocking/scary.<br /><br />It was impactful enough for me to give gluten free a try. With results expected within a month, I thought it worth the try. By the way, I am (was) a self-confessed carb addict, but by no means an obese individual at 6'2\\" 217lbs.<br /><br />The first 2 weeks were tough - no doubt the withdraw symptoms. I'm coming up to 8 weeks now and coincidentally just had my annual blood work done. My historically high triglyceride levels (280 last year) have been cut in half to 145 mg/dL. This is the first time in 10 years of annual monitoring that they have been below \\"high\\" (over 200 mg/dL).<br /><br />Something I did not expect was for my total cholesterol to have dropped 35 points to 134 mg/dL, (especially considering I eat eggs for breakfast every day now!)<br /><br />I have lost a solid 8 lbs. (Not as spectacular as the book describes, but alas I have been eating gluten free alternatives, something the author warns about doing - shame on me!)<br /><br />I have not noticed any miraculous ailment improvements, mainly because I did not have any of those described in the book before hand. For me, this was all about fixing my triglycerides and losing some belly fat as effortlessly as possible.<br /><br />Apart from the improvements stated above, by far the most profound impact I have experienced is in my appetite. I no longer feel ravenously hungry, never get hypoglycemic anymore, and have lost all cravings to snack between meals. I also never feel the need to go back for seconds. I cannot stress how good a feeling it is to not be craving food or feeling light headed because I haven't snacked for 2 hours. Just as the author describes, instead of feeling ravenous mid-morning after my 2 pieces of toast for breakfast, I eat eggs and bacon now for breakfast and find that sees me through to dinner without even thinking about it! (Note: before being gluten free, eggs on toast still had me hungry mid-morning.)<br /><br />At the end of the day I am impressed. The improvements in my blood work results has certainly encouraged me to continue on gluten free for now. I want to see if I can continue to lose a pound a week to lose another 10-15 lbs.even thinking about it! (Note: before being gluten free, eggs on toast still had me hungry mid-morning.)<br /><br />At the end of the day I am impressed. The improvements in my blood work results has certainly encouraged me to continue on gluten free for now. I want to see if I can continue to lose a pound a week to lose another 10-15 lbs.

B005LAII08|5.0|It a typically Disney Movie. I give it five star but is a four or four and a half stars movie. You be the judge after you see it. I think is a good movie to have in your Disney collection.. 3D is very good.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|As a cancer surviver I could relate to much of what the main character was going through.

B0067TGSOK|5.0|Story after story of how ordinary people like yourself (myself) have made something of themselves by actually taking action on an idea they had. Some quite by accident, others with pure determination, all of them with a drive I have come to find out is the one thing a person must have in order to be successful at anything. As inspiring as each persons story was I only found myself being more and more disheartened. I apparently lack the drive. I have the ideas, I have the desire, I may even have the intelligence, but the lack of drive to action seems to always get in my way. Not this books fault, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a positive outlook and only needs a little push to go.
B009A9BF5G|3.0|After two complete viewings, I wondered for a while if I'd received the SD-DVD version by mistake.  I don't buy very many Blu-ray discs, but I do know what to expect in terms of quality with those I have purchased. I was immediately struck with the \\"graininess\\" that pervades this production.  After assuring myself that I had everything set right, I came to realize that what I was seeing is apparently a conscious, production choice.  The actual camera work with the unbelievable angles they pull off is stunning.  It just seems to be an odd mix with this throw-back, 8mm home-movie camera video motif.  They do call it a \\"film\\" after all, so if a 1960's film effect is what the director was after, they succeeded.<br /><br />The audio production comes closer to living up to what I'd expect from a Dolby 5.1 Blu-ray disc.  Keeping in mind that this isn't a pure \\"concert\\" video, expect some heavy-handedness in the audio mixing.  At times the \\"live\\" concert sounds purely balanced, but other times it's clear that there's some production assistance being rendered.  Coldplay is known for its liberal use of backing tracks in concerts and it seems like there's even more post-production manipulation of the backing track components in Live 2012.  The net result actually sounds better than what I heard live when I saw Coldplay in concert during this tour, where the bass and percussion were predominant in the house mix.  On the other hand, it didn't sound as \\"live\\" as Coldplay's Live 2003 DVD.<br /><br />The band's performances on this film are generally good and at times exceptional.  The highlight performances are Hurts Like Heaven, Yellow (primarily because of its baroque-ish opening), Up in Flames (this band works subtle wonders in alternative unplugged sets), Us Against the World (best harmonies I've heard between Will and Chris... Will actually finishes the final two solo verses of this song showing an incredible tonal range), Fix You is the best live version of the song I've ever heard because the band stays more faithful to the character of the song and you can hear each of their contributions to the 4-part harmony in the final two choruses.  The \\"Extra\\" versions of Don't Let it Break Your Heart and The Scientist are also stellar moments.  It's too bad that there's not a way to patch them into the film where they belong in the setlist.<br /><br />Each band member has an intermission in which they share their musings about the current state of the band.  There's nothing really heavy-hitting there, but it does give the observer a better look at the personalities of Chris, Guy, Jonny, and Will.  There's also some delightful \\"airy\\" versions of Coldplay songs that play in the background during these monologues.  I would love to have had these airy versions of all the songs played as an audio bonus.  These intermissions were vital in helping sell this production as a sort of documentary film rather than a pure concert video.<br /><br />A few other random notes in closing; I'm not a fan of 'The Princess of China', but the version included in this film from Paris actually made the song tolerable.  The percussion is usually so heavily distorted that it dominates the song, but it's more in balance here.  It also doesn't hurt that Rihanna makes an in the flesh appearance, tastefully donned in fitting attire, for her part in the song.  There's an interesting bit of chemistry taking place between Rihanna and Chris as the song winds down, with Chris finally having to deflect Rihanna's exploring hand, while not rebuffing here strongly enough to break the interlocked microphone intimacy they shared for the closing moments.  Clocks is my favorite song of all time, but I'd have to say that this is the weakest version of Clocks I've ever seen or heard Coldplay perform.  The Live 2003 version runs circles around it. I don't like the oddly distorted instrumental break in the middle, versus the pared-down reprise of the haunting piano intro of the 2003 Live and studio versions. It also sounds like they prematurely bail out on the wind-down of Clocks. It loses so much of its character in that it doesn't reach its deserved conclusion, IMO.<br /><br />Finally, I was disappointed to learn that my favorite song from the MX Tour concert I saw - Warning Sign - is not part of the package, nor is the satellite stage acoustic version of Speed of Sound.  These two songs help show the versatility of the band and it's surprising to see that they didn't make the cut.  Even with the grainy quality of the video, I'd be close to awarding the disc 5 stars if they'd had included Warning Sign and SOS.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|These movies are a fantasy. they let people believe for a little while that there are wizards and all the mythical wonders that are involved in these movies are real.
0142406112|3.0|This book had an interesting premise but I didn't feel it was executed very well. There were too many \\"fortunately\\"s. So, for example, \\"Oh no, someone's coming. Fortunately there's this supply closet right here I can hide it.\\" Or, \\"Oh no, I need to leave this highly secure compound. Fortunately there's someone who not only forgot to lock this door, but they left the key in the lock.\\" Or, \\"Oh no! I need to get into this abandoned, locked tunnel. Fortunately it turns out it's unlocked!\\" Because of this, it just felt like there was no tension or suspense. If you counted up all the \\"fortunately\\"s, \\"luckily\\"s, and other \\"y\\"s that meant the same thing, you'd probably have half the book.<br /><br />Plus, most of it wasn't believable for me. So MI6 sends in their best agent. He dies. They send in a boy who makes mistake after mistake and has practically no training. He lives. Yeah right. Not only is that entirely implausible,but MI6 probably wouldn't train a boy, give him no choice in the matter and force him into a life or death situation. I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />If you're looking for spy novels for the younger set try Gallagher Girls (more for girls), the Heist Society books (also girls) or the Ranger's Apprentice (for boys, but usually girls are okay with reading about boy main characters).

B007W8S2MG|5.0|Short and simple review. For people who enjoyed Persona 3 and persona 4 you will enjoy this ! Persona golden is a RPG game and a remastered version of persona 4 which was release for the ps2 a few years back. Persona golden features many new things which wasn't avaliable in the ps2 version such as an extra character , personas and social links. The persona games takes a crap load of time to complete and has alot of replay value even after finishing it. Overall for people who enjoyed the persona games it is HIGHLY recommended that you pick up this copy ASAP !! and for those who are new to the game or the RPG genre give it a go and I know you wont regret it as there is soooo much to do in this amazing game.
1582701709|1.0|Since this is little more than a reformulation of Norman Vincent Peale's The Power of Positive Thinking, I will simply repost my review here.<br /><br />One of Peale's friends is quoted as saying \\"Every day when I wake up I realise I have a choice. I can be happy or unhappy. So what do I do? I'm not dumb. I just CHOOSE to be happy.\\" What nonsense. I am reminded of a particularly callous sermon I had the misfortune of listening to in Japan back in 2010, where a pampered pastor described the Haiti earthquake victims as happy. If they were so happy, why were they collecting money for them? How someone can live with such blatant mountains of cognitive dissonance is simultaneously disturbing and infuriating.<br /><br />Peale's friend could easily be shown the error of his ways by someone with more life experience. If I knew someone like that, I would punch him until he realised that happiness is not something that can be \\"chosen.\\" We would not need psychologists, psychiatrists or people willing to listen and help each other if happiness was that simple. NVP tries to strengthen this platitude with another from former US President Lincoln: \\"People are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be.\\" What nonsense. All this shows is that even charismatic leaders can be incredibly shallow at times.<br /><br />NVP trots out prayer and dependence on Jesus as a solution (when in actual fact, it is the calming of one's mind that actually helps, not the prayer itself). This is nonsense, as numerous prayer studies and the utter dearth of regenerated amputees has already demonstrated.<br /><br />If you want your life to improve, go out there and do something to make things better. Don't expect this travesty of a book or wishful thinking to do it for you.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I chose this book because I've enjoyed Jamie McGuire's other books. I was disappointed in the characters.  The main guy was a smoker, yet a fighter, and totally covered in tattoos with a shaved head.  Not my idea of a romantic hunk...
B005LAIHPE|1.0|My headline pretty much sums it up.  I mean I like action films but this one only has action.  Oh, and gratuitous shots of big-breasted women.<br /><br />While I saw that some of the reviews of this movie were bad, I figured Liam Neeson is in it so how bad can it be.  He usually doesn't pick bad scripts.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.  Without much meaningful dialogue, it was very hard to follow this movie.  I did watch it to the end just to give the movie a fair shake.  But even at the ending credits I was just left scratching my head.  I didn't like Cowboys & Aliens either but at least I could follow the movie.<br /><br />If you're looking for another aliens vs humans aka Independence Day-style, look elsewhere.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This second volume was a little less gripping than the first, probably because the wars of the early twentieth century are more familiar and more discouraging. It fits its title well.

B001VIMCW4|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. I am not a huge fan of the new Bond. I prefer Connery and Moore. Much more humor in those movies. Much more \\"English\\" and just more entertaining. Quantum has more of a Bourne feeling to me; still very good, though.
0451232852|5.0|Learning history, as we have, from a subjective point of view--wallowing in our victories, and blaming others for our losses--has caused us to repeat the mistakes of History.  We can safely call this a univerval problem, as every country honors their dead heroes, and kills their messengers of truth.  Ken Follett has cleverly cut through to the true cause of war, without raising too many hackles.  Contrived?  Impossible coincidences?  This is what makes it a novel. What makes this book a classic is folly being exposed.<br /><br />The truth he shows is what Shakespeare brought out--the fatal flaw of the overly ambitious!  Whether we call it the thrill of the hunt, or the desire to be alpha (there can only be one) the problem lies, not so much with the leaders, but with the people being easily fooled, used, and abused.<br /><br />The Age of Enlightenment came about when it was believed that reasoning would eventually answer all our questions, and solve all our problems.  When the wars continued, it was believed that reasoning did not work, and we have been in a free-fall ever since.<br /><br />Reasoning does work; Ken Follett has given us a reasonable solution to our problem.  Our leaders cannot be trusted--political or religious--as sooner or later they become corrupted by the power we have given them.<br /><br />As one reasonable person put it, England will be known by the way it gave up power, not the way she gained it. Hopefully we will learn this lesson before the bell tolls for us.<br /><br />Joan Morrone
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I am all astonishment at the positive reviews of this dreadful mess. The plot has been described, so I will only say I was intrigued by the idea and went in with a positive attitude. Alas, hope died quickly. I could go with Amanda and Lizzie switching places via some rip in the fabric of time located in Amanda's bathroom wall, although it's not one of the more elegant time travel scenarios.  But would the Bennetts have demonstrated such a complete lack of concern upon discovering that Lizzie had run off to stay at the home of people who were complete strangers to them?  NO. They would have been horrified! Did she have a suitable chaperone? Were her hosts respectable? But they just accept it and welcome into their lives Lizzie's oddly-dressed new friend, Amanda. Being a huge fan of the manners of Austen's time, Amanda naturally tries to fit in by smoking, getting drunk, and lunging at Bingley to kiss him - with tongue. Yes, this is SO Austen-esque.  Later, for reasons too ridiculous to explain, she tells Bingley she's a lesbian. Then she becomes engaged to Mr. Collins. Help us all.  Then Collins breaks it off with HER  (reflect on that for a minute - I mean how big of a loser would you have to be to get Mr. Collins to dump you?) at the Netherfield ball, after hearing a rumor that she is the daughter of a fishmonger. Amanda responds to his rejection by kneeing him in the crotch, which gets her kicked out of the ball in disgrace by Mr. Darcy. If any of this somehow sounds like it might be funny, I must disillusion you. It's all squirmingly uncomfortable and idiotic. I threw in the towel when Darcy declared his mad love for Amanda. This was a howler, as it made no sense even in the context of this stupid movie. Just a few scenes earlier, he told her she was \\"an abomination\\" - ouch! - but then, with hardly any additional interaction between them, he is supposed to be so besotted that he overlooks the minor quibbles that she is the  hard-drinking, bi-sexual daughter of afishmonger. Oh, the sheer stupidity. I do have one positive thing to say: the scenes and costumes were beautiful.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Loved this book.  What a great way to learn (on a macro level) about history.  Quite an undertaking for Mr. Follett, taking on WWII from the perspective of a German, Englishmen, Russian and an American.  And not only tackling WWII but touching on the atomic bomb, its development and a fictional view of how to create the bomb was shared with the Russians.  I never enjoyed history in school, however this book is definitely a page turner.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books from Nicholas Sparks, is different from the others he has written. The ending is amazing!! Love the characters, i hope that the movie is as good as the book.
B006G2124E|5.0|This film is one of the best I have seen depicting how socially unjust our society was in the not so distant past. It will touch the hearts of those who have lived through de segregation.
B0000TAZBK|4.0|I bought this for a present to my boyfriend but two cd were damage, but the company offer me to change it or Payme the money back! They're cool guys...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I thought this was great.  It's like his early books.  I would say his last few books have &#34;jumped the shark&#34; so it was nice to read the kind of book that made him famous.
B002ZG9846|1.0|The digital copy included on this blu ray copy is in standard definition. Something that should clearly be labeled before purchasing. What a disappointment.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I opened this book. Boy was I surprised!!! Aside from all of the amazing sex, this is a story about unconditional love.  Ana loving Christian despite his being 'fifty shades of f#@%ed up', and Christian loving Ana despite her being so different from 'the fifteen'. Fair point made well Mrs. James!!
B003WUYP56|3.0|I like the basic premise - scientific research has a vested interest in supporting its own favored sons (ideas), and has a great difficulty seeing or supporting new thoughts. As many out-of-the-box thinkers, I also have suffered this prejudice in my own field of computer science, and have spoken out on this subject ([...]). I really liked the clear demonstrations of the limitations, if not outright errors, in the established theories, but I didn't love so much the use of the book as a soapbox to promote the author's personal theories and preferences...
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I'm not sure if the movie was going for comedy or drama, but either way it completely failed as entertaining!
B00929G8SS|3.0|This review is for the import UK version release of Manowar \\"The Lord Of Steel\\". This version is not available through American Amazon  site. You need to buy this version on United Kingdom Amazon site. Manowar \\"The Lord Of Steel\\" is a good cd but has some flaws. The cd recording quality is not the greatest. The bass seems to be louder than the vocals and all other instruments. And the cd does not play as loud as their two previous releases. The \\"Thunder In The Sky\\" ep and \\"Battle Hymns 2011\\" cd plays louder than \\"The Lord Of Steel\\" cd when played at a same volume for comparison. The cd is good but the recording is a disappointment. Especially when Manowar likes to claim they are the loudest metal band in the world but their new cd does not play so loud.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|I am not a Twilight fan. Not of the books or of the movie series, but my twin sister is and she loved it!  She really recommends purchasing the series, especially in digital format so that you can watch it to your hearts content!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a sweeping epic with an incredibly realistic portrayal of historical events that shaped our world today.  It brings home the horror of war and the struggle for survival but all of that is contained within one of the best stories I've ever read.  You can't put this one down.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This app is pretty heavy on the ads, but it is fun.  I like it better than angry birds as it is a different challenge.
B00935KWWO|5.0|I have to say this is the best twitter app in my opinion. I really love this app. Luv the picture viewing and in-app browser.
B0095T3H2U|3.0|I thought is was going to be more of a comedy, but it's still good.  It's a long movie.  It definitely dragged on in certain parts.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I think it's a cool way to show your friends how you can draw. There's no way that I would delete this app from my kindle fire! try it;)
B0074YVW1G|5.0|Wonderful! Can't stop telling everyone about it! I feel as though having these somewhat obvious things articulated has given me permission to own who I really am.
B008ENNXQI|5.0|This a great Julia Roberts Movie, there are funny scenes. I don't think kids would like this movie, according to my 6 year old grandson, it's boring.  I suggest you see it for yourself.<br /><br />JUSTMESD
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Unlike in most of today's movies which are made with using unnecessary sex scenes that doesn't necessarly add much to the story and disgusting blood and guts scenes to validate it a horror show or movie; this program does use some very brief displays of these tactics but it is done with a bit more tact.  The plot isn't really obvious as to what may happen next and had surprised me when what I expected to happen didn't take place.  If you  are looking for the typical classic monster horror story (like the Wolfman, Dracula or Frankenstein) this isn't it.  What this is, is more of a real-life type of horror story of unethical practices and warped values of people in charge of an insane asylum and the people they are suppose to be taking care of but who really end up their victims.  Thrown in this mix is an evil spirit who possesses a young nun who works in the asylum. The chaos and the several sub-plots of the characters who make this production are quite interesting and it is this which keeps me coming back for more and to see what is going to happen next.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Such a good album, you will not be disappointed. Listened to them on spotify and I just had to buy it. Imagine Dragons killed it!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun, but fell short of anything with a re-watch value close to something like The Dark Knight. Whedon does a highly commendable job of tying together the different worlds of each Avenger into one cohesive, believable existence. But ultimately the great character dynamics and one-liners can't completely hide a thin plot and stepping-stone vibe of the film itself.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I stopped reading Grisham after the ridiculous 'Pelican Brief;' I thought I would give him another try with this book, but still a disappointment. Like Stuart Woods, he started out with some great reads, now just cranks 'em out for the (unjustified) reviews and (also unjustified) checks.
B008CP92ZO|1.0|Worst movie I've seen in 5 years! The police department should use this movie as an interrogation tool. After 5 minutes I would confess.
0547884591|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I've had the pleasure to read in a very long time. I can't even begin to think of what a massive undertaking it must have been to research and write this thing-- let alone to design it and print it. Althought the cover price is only $35, I would have paid up to $50 just to own it as an object (which is also why I would recommend buying the hardcover over the Kindle version.<br /><br />While it may not have the same crazy ambition of The Four Hour Workweek, or the intensity of The Four Hour Body, the overall aesthetic makes  The Four Hour Chef seem like The Dangerous Book for Grown-Up Boys (and Girls) meets The Joy of Cooking. But whereas the latter only taught readers how to cook a squirrel in a stew, in this book, Ferriss will take you, step--by-step through catching, cleaning, AND cooking the little critters, even going so far as to give you tricks for roasting them two at a time, in case you have a &#34;hot date&#34; (his words, not mine.)<br /><br />My advice: buy two copies, and keep one in your kitchen, and one in your guest bathroom. It's a hell of a conversation starter.
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef is another manifestation of Tim Ferriss pushing boundaries by innovating and hacking-- whether it be in biohacking, lifestyle design or publishing great books.  The 4-Hour Chef is a new form and new style of knowledge transfer being pioneered by Tim. Kudos to Tim.<br /><br />Anyone concerned with hacking self-improvement on many levels -- order this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|oh my I love this game and I have wanting to get it on the kindle fire. it is so fun!!!!!
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Playing this game brought back great memories of my first computer, an Apple II in 1977! (How silly, I have to add more words.)
B002RI9YE6|4.0|This is one of the best  Ishiguro novels. I really enjoyed it. His characters are well described and interesting. A book worth re reading.
B0092D1V5Y|2.0|Did  not  work  trult like  I thought it  would  to  find  passwords and able  to  find  WIfi spot. I  did  think it  did  very much.
B003X27L9U|5.0|This book is one that I will never forget! The first few pages had me wondering what it was all about. Written through the eyes of the child, it is an unusual book. Extremely disturbing storyline leads to a satisfying ending.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but I have been advised in the past that these books were fantastic. And after reading all three within about 2 weeks, I can agree with that statement. These books truly suck you in and make you fall in love with the characters. It's a very wonderful piece of writing. I highly recommend it!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I found this one the best read of the 3 in the series. A little more depth and character development.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The &#34;Panther&#34; is a quick, interesting read.  If you like a &#34;wise-guy&#34; hero, John Corey is very clever and &#34;punny.&#34;  However it takes forever to get to the action. 90% of the book is setting the scene, sometimes in excruiciating detail.  I found the book very &#34;put-downable.&#34; It reminded me of trying to get a large family out the door for a vacation. &#34;Come on, let's go!&#34;<br /><br />I bought the Kindle book based on his past books, which I found much more engaging. I hope DeMille isn't just &#34;cranking&#34; out books now.
B0031R5K72|5.0|Set in Nazi Germany this amazing story is a must read for anyone interested in history, literature or just a wonderfully researched and well written book.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great story line with strong characters. Not a dull moment - moves right along. Very intricate history and complicated chemistry.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Although this book is extremely erotic the very simple writing distracts from the basic story line. Upon reaching the final page however, one Is impelled to start the 2nd book in the series. Through the three books in the trilogy, there is some satisfying development in the characters and their relationship.
0425166805|2.0|this book is a bit fantastic, but also probable, however most speculative, without fact to prove it. It is not something you could believe and without proven facts.  However.....<br />.... it is very entertaining to read, sets you to thinking, but I guess it is a \\"seasonal\\" item that will pass as more scientific findings will become available.
B0031RSA24|5.0|A fascinating book. One that will open your mind to other ideas and options, although many may find it upsettingly controversial. I loved it.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This is the first movie I have  ever seen with CLOSED CAPTIONS on amazon instant video.Keep up the good work amazon.Bravo!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have read just about all of his books over the years and almost without exception I enjoyed them . However after struggling to get through this one I finally quit after about 60%. Maybe one of us is getting too old. For the benefit of the readers I hope it is me!
B006RXPTNM|5.0|This is a great movie.  It keeps your attention from beginning to end and it makes you really think.  Meryl Streep is an amazing actress--so versatile.  My husband and I decided we want to watch it again soon, because it's one of those movies that you know you'll catch more of the details the second time around.  I highly recommend this!
037571457X|5.0|Easy-read, touching, and eye-catching book. I would recommend this book to students who are struggling with their identity search as well as to people who just need a good read.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|This easily became my favorite album of all time. SHM are my #1 favorite artists ever so of course I'm going to love this album. Until Now is a MUST own for any SHM fans. House fans will love it.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I didn't know that I need to have a Blu-ray player for this. I ended up buying a Blu-ray player. Although I spent more than I planned to spend, it was worth buying. Great quality!
B004SBX112|5.0|Enjoy playing Angry Birds a lot. Enjoy playing the new levels that come up during the game. I really like playing Angry Birds
0316067938|5.0|Came in with a perfect condition. It was a gift to my sister who love The Twilight Saga. She loved it!
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|So someone was able to raise enough capital to make this. I'd like to meet this savvy sales person. Very talented.

The CD<br />brings back the same Spirit of Christmas<br />we experienced live, Rod know's Christmas<br />and Family, that is why we Love and respect<br />him as we do. His music is an example of<br />his passion of this special season.
B0042UEU8M|4.0|As a sailor I appreciate the settings, boats and story line of this movie.  It isn't the greatest movie in the world, but it is easy to watch, over and over.
0679746323|5.0|This is a must read for all. The book is a testament to the hard work and sacrifice of the authors. A tremendous amount of time and research was put into this. This book exposes in graphic detail the sadistic life of one of the two biggest mass murderers in world history. Mao is exposed as someone who only cared about himself and took great delight in watching people tortured and killed. He cared nothing about his country, the people of China , or his legacy. He only cared about his life on earth and what he could take for himself. Much of Mao's story was fabricated by Communist sympathizers who he brought in to write about him. He carefully controlled the messages in order to insulate his power and spread Maoism. This book blows those myths to pieces.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This is an awesome fun game with the best graphics I have ever seen in a game on my Kindle Fire!  I felt like I sliding backwards into the water with the ship!!  Way to go G5. The time it takes to download is well worth the wait.  Great strategy with some hidden object and puzzles that are difficult enough not to get boring but not so hard to get discouraged. Also love the maps where it shows you have an action pending so you dont have to use the hint button very ofter.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I am a Tim Ferriss fan and have been looking forward to this book since it was announced.Visually it is beautiful, the colour photographs are a step up from the 'Four Hour Body'. The recipes look good and have been stripped right back to the essentials. More importantly the structure of the book progresses smoothly from every day dishes through to exciting and spectacular foods (bacon infused whiskey being my favourite). Following the book start to finish helps build confidence and tackle recipes when you are ready.<br /><br />The claim that you can become world class in almost anything in six months has drawn comparison to Malcolm Gladwell's excellent book 'Outliers'. S Ferriss explains early in this book his definition of world class is to reach the top 5% of practitioners in a given field. Having attempted a few experiemnts from the Four Hour Body and following the success stories of others I believe that Ferriss' methods can greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to drastically improve. In contrast Gladwell looked at the furthest extremities, the top 0.5% who could be called proper geniuses. The Four Hour Chef doesn't claim it can elevate an amateur to that level in six months. However, armed with a new mindset, it will be interesting to see if if a compromise can be reached whereby a beginner reaches the very top in less than 10,000.<br />The Four Hour Chef is a good place to start and will hopefully be the first in many books that tackle the topic of meta learning and efficiency.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read the Hunger Games Trilogy straight through.  I'm not sure I like where the author took Katniss in the end, but overall it was a good read.
006197806X|5.0|Lauren Oliver is a fabulous writer. The second book is a lot of series doesn't stand up to the first, but this one actually might have been better and I loved the first book.  Great ending.
0449014509|5.0|My son listened to this and remained interested.  Too big of a book for him to finish in a reasonable amount of time reading the \\"old fashioned way\\".
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I find myself listening to this soundtrack on repeat!  I can't get enough of it!  Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B0055IU4GM|4.0|Hiatt has a new CD out & I'm one behind!  I'm going to digest \\"Dirty Jeans & Mudslide Hymns\\" before I budge!  The opening track is amazing with its churning guitars that reflect the hard life in the lyrics, \\"I gotta sister who's a thief & she's filled with hate, now she's gotta job working for the state; Another brother just got out of the Florida Pen', wears a bracelet on his ankle so they know where he's been.\\"  \\"I Love That Girl\\" puts a smile on my face with its guitar avalanche and Hiatt's lyrics snarled romantically, \\"We'd been left by the road in the back of the night; We'd been stranded by dreams and then shot full of moonlight; They took us downtown & the read us our rights.\\"  While these are my very favorites, \\"Train to Birmingham,\\" \\"Down Around My Place\\" and the somber tribute \\"When New York Had Her Heart Broke\\" are all delights.  Enjoy!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is an awesome album. If you like the songs played on the radio you will love the entire disc.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I expect good work from this writer.  He lived up to those expectations.  The book maintained the good humor and fast paced action as the tv series, Castle.  I do recommend this book.
B000YKG5L4|5.0|If you have heard one or two One Republic songs on the Radio you will love this entie album. Be sure to also check out the other album Waking Up.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Liked this book so much that I ordered the second book.  Great story answers many questions as to the economy and life style of weslthy and poor and how they are affected by the war.
B002WPVNOS|5.0|If you have heard one or two One Republic songs on the radio you will love this entire album. Be sure to check out their other album Dreaming Out Loud.
B007TMON8M|4.0|I like the simplicity of the game. Basic physics and intuitive. Simple enough to understand. Recommended to everyone. My only regret is that it needs more levels. No need to be a rocket scientist but it surely helps you feel like one.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This Christmas album is a great addition to any Christmas playlist. This album will appeal to many generations and music genres.
B001EN71DG|5.0|To me it's the best series of films ever.<br />I would like to criticize Amazon for not making an exception and allowing 6 stars for this product.<br /><br />This product got lost on the way and Amazon replaced it very fast as soon as the nominal time for delivery was over so udos to them.  If I had been the postman I would have stolen them too.
1451695195|3.0|Proof of Heaven: Seems more dreamy than the reality I have read in other NDE books. I was especially disconcerted when the good dr. said he had an especially deep NDE. The book is mostly about prior and after the event. The 'deep' NDE's I have read about include relatives, friends, Christ and details about a glowing, holy city. Am happy the dr. had a NDE but didn't feel it was deep or spiritual, even with St. Peter in the picture.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Lucasfilms did everything in their hands to ruin the Star Wars saga.  A clown, a sugary romance, a couple of crap actors in main roles, a couple of ridiculous scenes and excess of computer generated images that make it look like a playstation game.<br /><br />But they failed.  Just Ewan McGregor's acting, seeing C3P0 meet R2D2, Obi-Wan meet Anakin (the circle begins) and have the emperor-to-be tell anakin that he'll watch his progress with great interest is worth 5 stars.<br /><br />Watching these films is not pleasure, it's homework for the original trilogy fan.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son is 3 and he always wants to play it. For a free app I think we definitely got use out of it.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Book 1 and 2 are 5 stars, 3 and 4 are three stars because you get tired of the author evidently stretching the events apparently to make you just want more books, a but like the LOST series where the only purpose of a chapter is to get you to watch the next one, so it's best if there's always something about to happen but never really does.<br /><br />However, you can change your outlook and forget the story, just enjoy the scenery and the characters and cruise through the setting with the author, and you can buy back the enjoyment.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I am not a huge Taylor Swift fan, however I heard her sing Begin Again at the CMA's and I loved the song. I had to buy the CD and I was not dissapointed. I really enjoyed it. I have definitely downloaded a couple of her previous songs. I can now honestly say that I am a proud Taylor Swift fan!!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is not a typical fantasy story, it's a never ending series of well-described events involving perfectly profiled characters in a wonderful setting.<br />It's hard to grasp, you usually forget half of what you read and to be honest it doesn't matter.  You could skip 100 pages and keep on reading as if nothing.<br />It's like life.  Not everything happens for a reason, the sequence of events is unpredictable, follows no moralistic or predictable model and you can either hate it or get used to it.  I decided to be the latter.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Being a lazy teen I don't normally read for the fun of it. I liked the book a lot and its not long at all and easy to read. Although I didn't cry (because I'm heartless lol) it was extremely sad.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|My wife has had the DVD box sets (with the extended episodes) for I don't know how many years now.  She has already worn out season 7 and watches them ALL THE TIME.  As do I btw... great show.  I was excited to see that Friends was finally being released in HD so I hopped on the pre-order as soon as I could.  THANKFULLY I saw some other reviews before it shipped that spoke about how the Blu-Ray version was the original aired versions (that we see on TBS every day) instead of the extended versions like on the DVD sets.  With as many times as we have both watched the entire series... seeing the TV episodes on CBS and TBS makes it feel like something is missing.  You are waiting for a line and it just isn't there or you are expecting a scene and it doesn't happen.  While HD would be great and in many ways an upgrade... the non-extended shows are in every way a downgrade (for us).  So we'll continue to hold out.  My guess is the extended blu-ray set will be released in 2014 to coincide with the 20th anniversary.  They aren't gonna double-dip us for HD... we'll continue to wait until it is done right.
B009VB97EY|3.0|First, Matthew McConaughey is getting WAY too long in the tooth to do this kind of role. Kind of cringe-worthy. I found Channing Tatum's dancing to be the best part of this movie--WOW is he good. Other than that, this is all sort of tawdry and depressing. Could have been fun, but missed the mark. I'm giving it 3 stars because of Tatum's dancing and general presence, which is the only redeeming quality here. If you are a Matt Bomer fan, don't waste your money. He's just set decoration with a few moments of screen time (less than 45 seconds total, it seemed to me).
B009LK6JS2|3.0|This is more or less like Flight Simulator. There is a steep learning curve to play this game as most of the time I ended up stalling my planes. After about 1 hour of repeated game-play I was able to control the planes pretty well and the tilt controls works okay on Kindle Fire.<br /><br />There is no questionable permission issues. If you love flying airplanes and want to kill time landing one on your tablet I guess this will workout to be okay. The Graphics is decent and the music can be turned off.<br /><br />Overall decent simulation game. Three full stars from me.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I seldom review anything on Amazon.. but I must say - \\"Its been a LONG LONG time!!\\".  I'm  Plant's age.. followed his career up until his Band of Joy days, and found myself crying by the end of Celebration Day!  Page was in top form - everytime he smiled for love of his art - I smiled myself inside.  John Paul was the consummate artist and gentlemen and was also thoroughly enjoying the concert.  Jason showed that genes matter and he has certainly come of age.  And Plant - what more can I say.  He's just the best and the sounds coming from that man will never be duplicated.<br /><br />I'm thrilled that the concert was finally distributed to the rest of the world..  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Video was a little choppy at times but I didn't find it distracting.<br /><br />To those that didn't live through the Zep days - this is what music was all about..  this is what my generation loved and still cherish.

B009E9QOEO|5.0|Let me state upfront that I saw the movie in a theatre last week here in Cincinnati. The movie was being shown \\"one night only\\" across theatres in the US, in anticipation of the official release of \\"Celebration Day\\" this week.<br /><br />The music on \\"Celebration Day\\" (2 CDs; 16 tracks; 115 min.) is nothing short of stellar, although I will say that I enjoy CD1 more than CD2, due to the inclusion of some latter-day and/or not-so-obvious Led Zep tunes on CD1, in particular \\"In My Time of Dying\\" (an epic 11 min. blast), and even more so \\"For Your Life\\", one of my all time favorite Zep tracks (and one which Robert Plant announced as one they had never played live before), and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\", equally stellar. Sandwiched in between those two is a powerful \\"Trampled Under Foot\\". CD1 is just about perfect.<br /><br />CD2 concentrates more on the traditional 'greatest hits'. While I really enjoyed \\"Dazed and Confused\\", I was somewhat disappointed that is only an 11 min. version (dare I say \\"mini-version\\"?) of the legendary and much longer live versions we've heard in earlier days. I know that the band HAD to include \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in this set but if they never play it again, it'll be too soon for me, I just have been over-exposed to it over the many years (Led Zep's equivalent of Pink Floyd's \\"Money\\"). \\"Kashmir\\" is for me by far the most outstanding track on CD2 for me.<br /><br />As to the performances, what can you say. Jimmy Page (age 63 at the time) still has the licks, and then some. I just marveled how he gets those incredible sounds from his guitar. Robert Plant has preserved his voice in a very nice way. John Paul Jones plays a surprising amount of songs on the keyboards, but his work on the bass remains outstanding. And Jason Bonham did more than well, sitting in for his dad. The performances are 5 stars.<br /><br />While it was a nice experience to see the 2007 \\"Celebration Day\\" concert in the theatre last week, the true keepers are the CDs and I have zero doubt that I will be playing the CDs for years to come, whereas the movie, not so much. As an aside, I had the good fortune of catching Led Zeppelin once in concert, on the 1980 European Spring tour, sadly only months before John Bonham would pass away. What an incredible evening that was. And as \\"Celebration Day\\" proves (once again), the music of Led Zeppelin will live on forever!have zero doubt that I will be playing the CDs for years to come, whereas the movie, not so much.

B007SGLZP8|1.0|Amazon sent me an email asking me how many stars I would give 'The Racketeer'.  The answer is one.  The Product Description concludes with the words, \\"Nothing is what it seems...\\"  The reason for that is we have an unreliable narrator.  The 'plot' pivots between an omnipotent third person narration and the first person narration of the hero.  There is a terrific set-up which has been amply described in scores of other reviews.  My problem is I don't like to be manipulated for a couple of hundred pages by a seemingly 'honest man' fighting against the system that railroaded him, only to be told in a long tedious wrap up that even Agatha Christie wouldn't have dared to write, that it was all just a bunch of b.s.  This is lazy, dishonest writing.  Maybe Grisham should write fewer books, or failing that, at least don't hold his readership in contempt.  The one star, really, is for some of his past novels and short stories that were invested with passion and point-of-view.  Here, we have an author phoning it in - on speed dial.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Great Movie, Love the fact I can watch it on my computer.This is the way to go..Movie Quality on my computer is great..Great girls night out movie. Channing Tatum is hot in this. As is Matt Bommer!
B009E3EY38|3.0|I have been a huge fan of Led Zeppelin for as long as I have been a fan of music, and I have been looking forward to the O2 show being released commercially since I watched low quality cell phone videos after the show.  It was obvious that the performance was fantastic and the band sounded sensational.  When they announced Celebration Day, I pre-ordered on Amazon same day and set aside most of my Monday night to watch the blu ray.<br /><br />I cranked up my surround sound earlier tonight and popped in the Blu Ray.  While Good Times Bad Times sounded great, there was something that wasn't quite right.  I soon realized that it was the editing of the video.  I knew from reading advance info that they filmed the show with 16 cameras.  This should have been a positive, but just because you HAVE 16 cameras doesn't mean you have to continuously use them.  The video very rarely stays on the same camera shot for more than 3 seconds.  Once I realized that was what was messing up the flow of the show, I actually started counting.  I hoped that it was a tempo thing tied to the first song, but it continued for the whole show and was very distracting.  It also made it hard to observe the interactions between the band members, which is too bad because everything I read about the show was that they really seemed to be enjoying themselves.<br /><br />Putting the video portion aside, they sounded incredible.  Plant's vocals are at least as good as they were live near the end of Zeppelin (ie - Knebworth show), and far better than at the other one-off reunions in the 80's.  On some songs, Plant's somewhat weathered voice actually worked better than his younger vocals.  Page sounded great, and it doesn't sound like they did much as far as overdubs in the studio - it is Jimmy's performance, with all the highlights and the occasional warts.  JPJ and Jason Bonham were powerful and as tight as if they'd played together for years.<br /><br />As a fan, it was worth getting the deluxe edition for the video of the rehearsal.  The video (shot from a single stationary camera pretty far back) and audio quality is obviously not up to the standard of the O2 show, but some of the performances sounded like they were even better than the O2 versions.<br /><br />Despite my disappointment in how this performance was presented on video, I would still recommend it to any Zeppelin fan, provided they already owned [[ASIN:B00008PX8P Led Zeppelin]].  Zeppelin's performance and the audio CDs are 5 star, but it is mystifying to me that what may be the last performance by this epic band was edited together so poorly, especially since my understanding was that Jimmy and JPJ were heavily involved.for the video of the rehearsal.

B000I186FW|5.0|Very intriguing movie with outstanding acting. And unlike the vast majority of movies, this one has a message.  This is a movie you will remember and a movie that you will find yourself thinking about. Well done.
B004LL1HM4|1.0|Seems like the members of Fleet Foxes must have personally offended the other one-star reviewers at some point in their lives. I'm gonna try to keep this one based in reality. I'm giving this album one star, not because I hate the band or their fans or the genre or whatever, but just because I find Helplessness Blues specifically to be almost unbearably boring and devoid of redeeming value.  This tragedy is compounded by the fact that I LOVED the EP's and the first LP.  Loved them long time. I've listened to this album five times from beginning to end, wanting and waiting to love or even like it.  It still strikes me as the musical equivalent of watching grass grow...<br /><br />I don't know what else to say about this album, except that it's an example par excellence of the dreaded sophomore slump. Or maybe they've just run out of good songs. I mean, every band seems to have a different amount of water in the well. Or maybe fame is the culprit.  At any rate, it seems the exception rather than the rule nowadays when a band doesn't fall off after a solid album or two.<br /><br />I really identified with the hype about their previous work, I think it was well-deserved.  But this album simply doesn't deserve the credit, IMHO, that so many people and publications have been giving it.  I waited and waited for one song approaching the emotional impact of Blue Ridge Mountains or Mykanos or Textbook Love, etc., or one with a hook half as catchy as any of their previous work.  One that you can't help blasting and singing along with. No such song is contained on Helplessness Blues.  The Fleet Foxes really phoned it in on this one. You're better than that, double F's, and I mean it...

B000001FBS|2.0|Not being a hard-core KISS fan, but more of an 'appreciator' of their earlier work, I was drawn to buy this album primarily after reading Ace's autobio. It truly is the odd man out from the usual KISS album, and to paraphrase Ace, 'it isn't really a horrible album, it just isn't a KISS album'. Strange days indeed...

B00984668E|5.0|This is a great buy. I only got into The Sword within the past year but they are quickly becoming one of my favorite bands. This album doesn't disappoint and sounds somewhere between the concept-rock of Warp Riders [2010] and the classic heavy metal of Gods of the Earth [2008].<br /><br />As far as the Deluxe Edition goes, I love the artwork and the live tracks are very good quality.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I knew very little about the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright. What a diverse eccentric arrogant genius. This is the story of his love of an equally brilliant woman who left her husband to be with Wright who left his wife for her. The story takes place in the early 1900s.. My only observation as to the style of the writing is that the dialog does not sound like that time period.  Much inclusion on the early feminist movement.  Lots of agonizing by the principal characters over their situation of needing to be together at the same time as they are being censored .. Fiction based on research into actual writings of the characters.
B001BEG2LK|5.0|I originally owned this on vinyl, then on cassette, then on CD, and now in MP3 format. My oldest son ended up with the LP, the cassette was eaten by a tape deck, and the CD became scratched over time. This is a MUST-HAVE for any TRUE Iron Maiden fan, so needless to say, when Amazon started offering MP3's for purchase, this was a no-brainer for me. Powerslave embodies the essence that is Iron Maiden. I believe that since this is my fourth time to purchase this album, the quality of Powerslave should speak for itself.

057809665X|1.0|I bought this for my son who is a Financial Adviser. I never gave it to him.<br />The author tells you how to get strangers babbling to you endlessly about themselves but there are no examples about how to apply this in your business life.<br />I suppose you can deduce that you could try some of these methods in your hardware store, the courtroom, or on a sales call, but most people are in a hurry and just want to know how much the widget costs. Why would people even want to hang out for an hour or two yakking it up in the hardware store? More to the point, why would you want to waste your valuable time listening to a stranger's history and how he became the Syracuse ring toss champion in 1957?<br /><br /> I see 2 instances where these techniques could be effective:<br />1. Picking up women in a bar or other public place -- which makes this book priceless for some of you.<br />2. If you are in the type of sales where the client or prospect is already prepared for a lengthy meeting -- and you are prepared to listen to a lot of off-topic crap. They may not buy anything, but they'll love you.<br /><br />If you've met someone you'd like to know better, then buy the book. I bet it works great for making new friends -- that's probably where its real value lies.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great Book. Really makes you feel that there is much more to life!  Worth reading especially if you are feeling blue!
B005EGXTL2|4.0|A fine end to the trilogy. Engaging and exciting plot. In depth characters you believed in. Nearly reached word count
B0083SBJXS|3.0|From the time I walked out of the theater to a few days after, I was puzzled about the Avengers.  I kept asking myself, \\"did I miss something?\\"  I just did not seem to have the same 5 star experience that everyone else was having with the film.  After purchasing the blu-ray and re-watching the film, I can confidently say that I did not miss anything.  The movie was fun and entertaining yet flawed at its core.<br /><br />SOME MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />PROS:  The action and special effects of the Avengers was nothing short of magical.  Almost everything looked real with only a few moments where I could really pick up on the green screen effect.  The final battle scene that displayed the Avengers fighting together in all their glory was breathtaking and was exactly what I was waiting for during the fist 3/4 of the film.  I do not believe that they could have done the fight scenes any better, as all were perfectly choreographed and paced with the Thor/Hulk fight slightly rising above the others.<br /><br />CONS:  The film did have a few good laughs, but I couldn't help get the feeling that they were trying way too hard.  The constant one-liners broke up the flow of the movie they and only worked for me about once every three times.  I also did not feel there was much chemistry between the characters with the one exception being between Stark/Banner.  Captain America was awkward throughout and at times it seemed like Thor wasn't allowed to speak for more than one sentence.  The film also had an unremarkable soundtrack, which is a big deal for me as I consider film scores almost as important as the visual side (the LOTR trilogy is a prime example of great movies that were made epic by the music). The last major point that bothered me about the Avengers was the story.  I loved Thor, however, I felt the weakest part of that film was its villain, Loki.  Needless to say, I was again disappointed with Loki.  There was at no point in the entire movie where I felt Loki hada reasonable chance to win, and what is worse is that Whedon had numerous characters tell Loki just that..  The story itself was somewhat boring and filled with numerous holes that were either not explained, or explained in a one-sentence half-hearted manner (Thor's return to Earth being the major example along with Banner being able to suddenly control the Hulk).<br /><br />BLU-RAY:  The product itself it great.  This is a visual effects experience that is a must-own for blu-ray fans.  The movie looks and sounds great and is easily one of the best looking films of all time.  The special features are somewhat lacking, however I do not usually pay a lot of attention to them.<br /><br />OVERALL: 6/10

B009FZHYKU|3.0|We are only 6 shows into the new season and the writers are apparently running out of ideas.They are resorting to the old hack tactic of having characters do dumb things to heighten tension.The really bad thing is they do it in such an obvious way,like the prisoners stand off.There is no way a cop would have played it out that way,not even maybe.This is one of the hottest shows on tv ,and this is the job the writers do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If you like books that keep you guessing all the way through, you'll enjoy it too. I find that my favorite books are the ones where none of the characters are all good or all bad. Real people are multi-faceted and so are the characters in this story. I'll look for more of her books for sure.

The songs have no soul like her previous albums.<br />Song Numb featuring Eminem is so annoying. Such a shame considering Love the Way You Lie was amazing. Overall album feels incomplete. Rushed. Some very ordinatry songs. The one song that seems to stand out from the rest is the recent single Diamonds. Seems like she is under alot of pressure to produce albums to quick thus lacks quality.

B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Ignorant reviewers aside, this movie is outstanding. It stays true to the source material and presents a future darker than anyone, including Batman, could have imagined. Peter Weller was the perfect choice for an older Batman. I only wish there was more to the story (but please, WB, don't animate Dark Knight Strikes Again).

CHANGE IT! GO OUT AND DO SOMETHING! I wish I had the capability to just drop everything and move to Italy for a few months. Maybe at some point in my life, I would love to do something like that. I definitely recommend this book! What makes it better is that it's based off Liz's own experiences!

And I know by now that Mr. Grey seems to be a very handsome person. Anastacia doesn't need to remind me every 3 seconds.. But you still want to keep reading because you want to know the ending (at least I did).. And after the second book you'll alsow want to buy the third book.

I saw most of the NAT GEO depiction and if I were a SEAL I would be pissed that they showed it the way they did.  These men don't act the way the NAT GEO movie showed it.  And there were MANY discrepancies between the two.  The biggest one in the movie was the scene which made it look like a strait-forward execution on UBL.  In the book, he poked his head out and got popped twice.  He could have surrendered.  Must read this book

B005S9EK1S|3.0|Most people know that when they're going to see a movie adapted from a Nicholas Sparks book that its going to be a bit sappy.  That isn't the problem with this movie as it is bathed in cliches and unbelievable scenarios.  The biggest issue is that nothing much really happens.  The actors are beautiful to look at, the cinematography and location is stunning.  It's a sweet romantic drama story, but there isn't enough feeling or dramatics.<br /><br />Zac Efron plays Logan, a guy who is at war in the opening sequence where he stumbles upon a photo of a girl.  He chalks it up to fate that finding that photo saved his life.  He walks across several states if you can believe that to locate this girl to thank her.  Oh wouldn't you know it, when he gets there he can't bring himself to thank her and instead accepts a job position working for her on her farm.  Beth, played by Taylor Schilling, coincidentally lost her brother in the war.  She has a young son and a jealous ex-husband who is a drunk cop.  This guy doesn't like Zac Efron's character hanging around so he makes all kinds of bullied threats.  That's about as intense as the movie gets.<br /><br />The saving grace is the girls grandmother, Blythe Danner, who lights up the screen with all sorts of prophetic wisdom.  She seems to be the only one who knows Logan and Beth are destined for one another.  If only she was on the screen whenever the drunk cop ex was around making all kinds of noise.  Zac Efron is a gifted actor and shines in movies where he can showcase his musical skills and emotion.  However, in this he plays a guy that has to reserve his emotion and it doesn't seem to quite work.  It feels stiff and not terribly exciting or moving.<br /><br />This was enjoyable to watch once, but I don't think it's one I'll ever have the urge to pop in again, but maybe you will.

Let me tell you, I have had nothing but good experiences come out of this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I only warn that this is not the PC version. It is very very close but not it. But I find that fine because you can take it anywhere and everywhere whenever and however you want.

B009NQKXYK|4.0|Well in case anyone is like me I went into the movie without any information about it.  I didn't read reviews, and I didn't even watch a trailer, so I had no idea.  Well without any info, the movie was slow in spots, and I started to put things together pretty quickly.  It is a movie worth renting buying on DVD to add to your other related collection.  That said, I think I would have been disappointed if I went to the theater and spent 15+ on a ticket and then dropped another 15+ on drinks and popcorn...
B007P06DJ0|5.0|There are plenty of reviews describing how amazing the music is on Graceland, so this is about the Vinyl release.<br />We purchased the 25th Anniversary re-release. For those that listen to records, this is INCREDIBLE. The quality of the vinyl (180gram) is superb. The mix is perfect. You hear things you have never heard on cassette or CD. For any Paul Simon fan and any vinyl listener, this album is a must.

B009NPKTN6|3.0|Okay good stuff about this movie first.  Every supporting storyline was entertaining and most of the song choices were great.<br /><br />The main story line (the love story between young boy and young girl) could have been removed completely, the supporting characters could have been developed more and I would have actually loved this movie.  Because they spent more time on this forgettable pairing a few of the supporting characters were neglected and they didn't make much sense in the movie for instance Catheine Zeta Jones and her husband would have been far more interesting to know more about.  In my opinion anyway.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I had heard about these books from a friend and ordered the whole set. I couldn't wait to read each one. just waiting for news of each character kept me constantly reading until no work got done until I finished reading! The unexpected always happens, you cry , you scream with them all.Very complicated story line that if you can't refer back to the lists at the end of the book may be a little hard to follow. Can't wait for the next book.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Not exactly what I expected, but I certainly enjoyed the book. A great read to pass the time and now that I've read the book I can see the movie!
1932100660|5.0|This book changed the way I will eat forever.  The overwhelming evidence shows that diet is the major cause of all chronic diseases and that diet alone can reverse many of these diseases.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to live a long productive life.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was chosen by my book club and I was looking forward to reading it.  However, it's very hard to read a book when all the characters have no morals, whine constantly, and you have no sympathy for.  Since it was a book club book I felt obligated to read it, but I found it so anoying that I finally started skipping ahead since I was running out of time and patience.  Eventually, I did read the whole book, and found the ending was totally unbelievable.  Personally, I find it hard to enjoy spending time reading a book when there is not one person that you had sympathy for and the actions of the characters defy logic.  I also have to mention that this is the first time I have even bothered to remark on a book, which shows how much I disliked it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This story is a fantastic read. I did not care for the end. I do not want to give any spoilers; however, I think its because the writing fell from a carefully complicated story to something so very basic.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Really like this cd! I still love their sound and this new cd stands true to themselves with great new music!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I like Liam but this movie is sort of depressing, showcases a variety of worst ways to die in Alaska or wherever they are haha
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I love this movie.  I hardly ever purchase any movies, but this one's hilarious and sweet and maybe at times ridiculous, but definitely funny!
B004W1GD4A|5.0|Incredible cast, this series was so very awesome. What a shame on BBC to cancel. Kudos to the creators for reviving<br />165 Eaton Place.
0446580848|3.0|John Corey--Nelson DeMille's smart-ass, wise-cracking, ex-cop turned Anti-Terrorist Task Force agent--is one of my all-time favorite fictional action heroes. From the first time I met him in Plum Island, I knew that Corey had everything I look for: courage, fallibility and (most importantly) a sarcastic sense of humor. I've followed Corey's exploits through all six of his books. By this point, I know what to expect: a fast-paced thrill ride focused on some type of government cover-up or terrorist activity. So I was thrilled when I saw The Panther featured not just John Corey but also Paul Brenner (who made appearances in two other DeMille books, The General's Daughter and Up Country). What a kick to see two of DeMille's fictional creations go mano-a-mano!<br /><br />The plot, as usual, is very topical. Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, are sent to Yemen to track down an Al Qaeda leader named The Panther, who is believed to be the mastermind behind the USS Cole bombing. The Yemen setting is a huge part of the book, and DeMille obviously did his homework. The week after I finished the book, Time magazine had a story on Yemen that touched on many of the things mentioned in the book--including the pervasiveness of khat, the political situation, the landscape and Al Qaeda's presence. It was like seeing the book come to life.<br /><br />The book is essentially your basic \\"cat and mouse\\" story. This is both a help and a hindrance. On the plus side, DeMille ratchets up the tension by keeping Corey on the perpetual edge of death in one of the most dangerous countries in the Middle East. On the con side, a cat and mouse story ends when the cat gets the mouse (or vice versa) so there was certain amount of repetitiveness and stalling as we waited for our two adversaries to finally meet. DeMille throws in plenty of other machinations (you just never know who to trust ... including Corey), but I began to feel like things got a bit repetitive. The saving grace, as always, is Corey himself. With a constant stream of sarcasm and smart-assery flowing from his mouth, you're never bored with Corey along. (Though I imagine he would be a pain in real life.) Still, I felt this book stalled out in the middle as we waited for the denouement.<br /><br />All that being said, I enjoyed the book and will continue reading Corey books as long DeMille wants to write them. If you're new to John Corey, I suggest starting from the beginning (Plum Island) and working your way through the rest. The series is always engaging and humorous--though you might find yourself turning into a bit of a conspiracy theorist. If you're already a Corey fan, know that this isn't the strongest Corey book but our guy is still his wonderful sarcastic self.s, is Corey himself.

0062082353|1.0|If any American person wondered why there are negative feeling towards America and American people, read this book to discover why. This guy is narrow minded, blinkered and ignorant. He talks about kills like a badge of honor. He refers to all Iraqi people as savages. Whether a target is carrying a holy book or a machine gun, he sees both as legitimate kills. He has no regard for human life and never questions his reason for being in Iraq. It really begs the question of the US military selection policies if this guy can wear the uniform and represent the USA
B007SGM084|2.0|So I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about.  I almost did not make it through the first book.  The good:  The story becomes pretty intriguing so I read on.  The bad:  The author is a Brit who has set the story in America.  A lot of her language does not make sense.  She does not get the lingo quite right.  The ugly:  This is so badly written, I find myself editing it as as read.  The repetition is REALLY BAD.  So, don't expect a literary marvel.  It's a sweet story with some steamy stuff in it.  Personally, i'm intrigued by the characters pschycology so I'l finish it.  Bummed I'm out 30 bucks though.
B0095T3ES2|5.0|excellent movie.....good acting, good comedy, emily blunt was very funny. would see it again. i highly recoment thid movie if you are looking for a good comcey.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is a wonderous spectacle of color! I love visiting the beautiful islands neighbors have created.  It is also fun to see what the numerous crossbreeds will create.  The drawbacks are a clumsy link with your wall (you cannot access unless you are home) &amp; no counter to keep track of partial plays (tips) @ other islands.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't know what to expect of the second book of The Hunger Game because the first one was so great...but I was enthralled with the first page and could hardly put it down.  Great character development, great plot - made me feel like I was watching the movie sequel.  highly recommend!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This is a typical Nelson DeMille book which means if you like his sardonic sense of humor, you will like this book.  Generally the book generally moves along and during the lulls (of which there are several), his humor carries the day.  The reason for four stars (and not five) is the ending.  Since a couple of obvious CIA bad guys are left to live for another day, it's very likely they will appear in DeMille's next book.  Still, to leave them dangling at the end of this book is a bit unsatisfying.  This book is recommended to anyone who is a DeMIlle fan - it's typical Demille - and also anyone who likes the wise-guy hero (and his counterpoint spouse) will be a fan.  As a bonus -  if you are a fan of geography and were always interested in Yemen, this is also your book.  You'll come away with a different perspective of that middle east country and the role of Al Qaeda there.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|All the funniest parts were in the trailer. The rest of the movie was ridiculously predictable. Except for the end, which made no sense.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I've watched this in casinos and thought I might enjoy it. It was fun at first, but is rather monotonous. My grandkids like it better than I do.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|I've listened to this album non-stop since it was released in October.  It's truly a wonderful mix that is rare to find.  I haven't enjoyed a mix like this in years, probably not since the first time I listened to Paul Oakenfold's essential mix live from Home @ Space, in Ibiza.  That or Armin Van Buuren's State of Trance 2007.  The point I'm trying to make is great mixes are rare to find.  Sure you can have great tracks or great remixes but to have an entire album you can listen to from first to last and be uplifted, lost in the music, is truly hard to come by.  So thank you SHM for releasing this wonderful gem and allowing me to enjoy music for hours on end.  I will say that I like this over Until One.  Until One is a great album but it's a completely different mood and choice of music.  It's enjoyable in it's own right but if I had to choose between the two, I would go with Until Now.  If you're on the edge on if you should buy this or not, just do it.  You will not regret the choice and it will put a smile on your face, I can almost guarantee that.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Dragon Story is entertaining enough. Kinda of fun collecting new and unique dragons. Breeding them allows you get possibly get rare dragons which is cool. Overall, I would say good game.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Detective John Corey was a cop in New York and was shot three times and almost died.  His Uncle allows him to spend the summer recouperating at his house on the beach away from Manhattan.  A local Chief of Police gets him involved in solving a double homicide of a couple that John knew.  Soon the rumors are flying reading the homicide...was it drugs, burried treasure or deadly anthrax from Plum Island?<br /><br />This book was just a little slow but other than that it was great!  I enjoyed reading it and hope to see Detective Corey and Detective Penrose again!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|mom loves it
B004PVKFR8|4.0|So many bands were accused of being copy-cats when Nirvanna hit the scene, and I suppose that is likely to happen with Awolnation (i.e. copying Muse and/or Fun).  However, I found this album to be fresh and really enjoyable.  I heard &#34;Kill Your Heroes&#34; on the radio and was immediately hooked, but as I listen, I find I enjoy other songs on the album more.  There's a lot of musicality, and even a 10+ minute-long track that's like a medley of songs (that you don't know, but like).  I recommend this album for its musicianship - especially as we close out (hopefully) an era of overly mechanical/synthesized/autotuned music.  Buy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this is the only show I watch weekly, we don't have cable so I buy it from amazon. com and its worth it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. I could not put it down. It was nice to see love this real and raw. It was so emotional in a good way. This is a book that makes you really appreciate life and what you have. A stunning book.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is one of my favorite shows, and continues to deliver great storylines and character development.  Season 10 is shaping up to be one of the best!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third was as good as the first two, even thought there was a lot of the same \\"stuff\\".  After all, the storyline needed to evolve but the characters were still the same people, whose relationship was maturing.  I was sad that there was no more to read when I was finished.  Would probably read whatever she wrote, if she decided to continue with Christian and Anastasia - though I don't see that happening!!
1563898586|5.0|Its like the English version of The Avengers. Mina Harker (Black Widow),  Allan Quatermain (Captain America), The Invisible Man (Iron Man), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, (Bruce Banner and The Hulk), Captain Nemo (Thor). I don't know who (Hawkeye) is...he can be the cat on the front cover.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After the reading the first of this trilogy, I was hooked!!  I had to know how their relationship evolved.  This one was a bit more racey but was so well embedded in an enthralling story line that I couldn't say I was offended.  When I finished it, I immediately picked up the third one!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was truly amazing, I wasn't expecting me to be glued to my kindle for three days reading. Its made me remember how much I love reading. I definitely would suggest others to read it.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|this is one of the best app. the free version is awesome but the payed vertion is even better. get this app espesially 4 the kindle fire.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|My only regret is that I haven't read the Harry Bosch books in order.  Connelly has truly set a new standard for the mystery/police procedural genre.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|fun Sim. One of the better faotd's I've played. Takes some practice, but the controls are accurate. Graphics are surprisingly good and sound effects are also good. This one will not be banished to the cloud.
B0098VXE50|2.0|I bought this DVD on recommendation of a friend, he said it was a good movie.  NOT!  It was boring, dreary and with a face and personality of Kristen Stewart who cares.  To think a dwarf had to die for this dreary and colorless person is an outrage.  The subplot of the Hunter and his dead wife adds nothing to the story.  Also since Snow White didn't choose between her childhood buddy or the Hunter does that mean there is a sequel?  If I spend any more money on the Snow White saga, I'll buy the Disney version.
B001KWTBQQ|4.0|At the time of seeing this in the theaters, I was pretty irritated with Lucas. I approached it as essentially a 98 minute commercial, and I hate commercials. I have a DVR to run through them. That coupled with the fact my children were too small at the time to appreciate anything Star Wars didn't give it much of a chance.<br /><br />Since then,Disney has bought the brand. My kids have grown up to love Star Wars. I now can look at this movie in a different light. It is a pretty good move. It is so much better than Episodes 1-3. It reenforces the fact to let Lucas come up with the idea, but someone else needs to write the story and direct the story.  In fact, I like it enough that I have now picked up the first two seasons of the cartoon.<br /><br />Still waiting on them to get here.
B008R14YBK|2.0|I love Bridgit Mendler.  I LOVE HER.  She has a wonderful voice and is likable and appealing.  Unfortunately, I believe she received some extremely bad advice about her album \\"Hello My Name Is...\\"  The lyrics are poor, she tries (and fails) at rapping and exhibiting some kind of misguided \\"street cred\\".  Even songs that are otherwise enjoyable are ruined when she stops actually SINGING.  She's got an amazing voice and is an incredibly talented performer.  It's a damn shame that she didn't make an album that let us properly enjoy her gifts.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I reread the Complete Sherlock Holmes at least once every couple of years.  This is a solid collection in a good format.  Excited to have it on my Kindle.  There are some issues with font size and spacing, as well as some missing images, but overall I can't complain too much.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I love this series, both seasons.  The actors give amazing performances and the stories from both seasons are riveting.  This is not a series to be missed if you like to be scared and entertained.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read....a lot. It took me forever to get through this book. It was terribly repetitive, lacking in interesting events, and boring.
1401322786|5.0|I'm nearly done reading \\"The Time Keeper\\" and have totally enjoyed another Mitch Albom book.  He is always new,different and definitely first class!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I couldn't put this one down. I loved &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; and this was recommend to me by Amazon.  Captivating, intimate, action packed, and incredibly revealing. I was sad when it ended.
B000RN61UI|5.0|This book offers an interesting account of a psychedelic experience as well as social commentary. You will find blocks of narrative along with little sprinkles here and there of solid criticism of drab, sanctioned lifestyles.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|She can write and sing a good song (and I look forward to her getting more life experiences so she has more write about).
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best game u will ever play:) it has the occasional glitch but come on what game doesnt?? its very fun and addicting and has great graphics!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is SUPER fun! It is much different than Angry Birds. Whether you're a fan of Angry Birds or not, you'll probably love this game! I just downloaded the free version, but I highly recommend just buying the full version. It is definitely worth the small amount of cash compared to the large amount time you'll spend playing!!
B007QPFGJW|2.0|I did not enjoy this book.  The murder victim is telling his story, while the events involving Harry Hole being woven in between.  Too much to do about Harry's relationship with the inconstant Rakel, too much character analysis, not enough story detail.  O wait maybe the detail was suppose to be supplied by the murder victim.  Who knows?  I did was confused by the ending or lack thereof.  I was disappointed with this book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Typical, excellent thriller by DeMille!  Many references to &#34;The Lion&#34; so it would be helpful if you read that first.
0547884591|1.0|I thought this was going to be a recipe or a cook book for his 4hour body diet. I am sick of eating the same food all the time and I thought this would save me. It's not that. It only has a handful of recipes. Non of the recipes would work by themselves as diet food. If you want to learn to cook this isn't the way I would learn. I don't think I would recommend this book for either purpose.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, what a great book!<br />The Hunger Games gets a five star review from me because it is very rare for a book to keep me enthralled non stop for days. It is nearly impossible to find a place where you can stop reading to go do whatever it is you need to do because it has you on the edge of your seat until the end.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes action, suspense and even a little romance.
0545265355|5.0|This set of books has given quite a few people pleasure. I read it, then my boyfriend. I put it in the clubhouse library where it has made the rounds of a lot of people. Quite a few of us went to see the first movie together. It's not just for young people...I live in a retirement village!
B00124BNF4|5.0|I loved the dvd that the talking heads had a few years ago and the songs that were on it; when I heard this lp I had to get it....while it was selling at a great price, of course.  This was worth the money to me as the songs were all great to listen to.
0374214913|1.0|I played along expecting at some point for it all to fall into place, but it never did. I guess that is to be expected from juvenile fantasy genre.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is at his finest. Revenge, friendship, adventure and imagination all working together to right wrongs at the expense of the expected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|AMAZING!!!!!!!!! This is by far the most amazing game ever! I LOVE it and would totally recommends it to anyone!
B009E3EY38|4.0|Led Zeppelin's Celebration Day arrived at my home from Amazon, and I couldn't wait to get it into my Blu Ray player. After being rejected in lotteries for a couple of Zep shows back in the very late 70s before the tragic death of John Bonham (my inspiration for drumming), this release finally provides the opportunity to see the band perform in the next best way to seeing them live.<br /><br />This performance was captured at London's O2 Arena, and could be held up as a perfect example of the way a rock group should perform live. Barring some jumpy video editing, the show is a gem. I'll get to the jumpy video editing in a sec.<br /><br />The Celebration Day concert is all show. Close up shots of each band member dominate the screen throughout and capture not only the great talents of the players, but also some moments of intimacy between the bandmates that are often missed in other DVD musical shows. Most importantly, there are no theatrics here to distract from the Zeppelin classics that comprise the awesome setlist; it's just the guys playing on a brightly lit stage. And all of the boys clearly committed to each other to give performances that were true to the studio versions.<br /><br />As anyone reading this already knows, Jason Bonham fills in for his Dad on drums for this show...and he completely nails the essence of his Dad's drumming style both in look and style. Robert Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones are also completely on for the Celebration Day show. Page's white hair showed his age, but his guitar work showed his expertise. Jones' bass and keyboards sounded precise. But one of the key elements?...Plant's vocals sounded terrific; I have to say that I was blown away by how much he sounded like Robert Plant circa 1977. Just amazing.<br /><br />The picture quality and sound are absolutely terrific. If you've got a surround system, you're in for a pounding Rock experience. The sound has an amazing DTS mix.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as I alluded to earlier, the video (most of the time) jumps around every 4 seconds (or less), so you really don't get to see the performance in a way that makes you feel like you're in a front row seat right there at the O2 Arena back in 2007. The jumpiness makes you feel like...well...you're watching a DVD. Video producers need to leave the performance to the band and stop the self-indulgent \\"look what I can do with 16 cameras\\" editing. It's the worst during the fast songs; it's almost like the video editing team said, \\"Fast song...let's go with superfast camera changes.\\" And all that really does is take away from the front row perception.<br /><br />There were also some minor occasions where the videographer thought the viewer might like to see effects like a filtered, red screen, stop motion, slow motion or imagery effects. That kind of video-malarkey was quite popular in the 70s and even Zep's [[ASIN:B0012YYZYK The Song Remains the Same]] DVD. But c'mon, even if it was some nostalgic nod to the video ways of when Zep was at their height, I think it's something we would all prefer to do without. But none of the aforementioned really took too much away from this excellent Blu Ray composition.<br /><br />For the show you get the following setlist:<br /><br />1. Good Times Bad Times<br />2. Ramble On<br />3. Black Dog<br />4. In My Time Of Dying<br />5. For Your Life<br />6. Trampled Under Foot<br />7. Nobody's Fault But Mine<br />8. No Quarter<br />9. Since I've Been Loving You<br />10. Dazed And Confused<br />11. Stairway To Heaven<br />12. The Song Remains The Same<br />13. Misty Mountain Hop<br />14. Kashmir<br />15. Whole Lotta Love<br />16. Rock And Roll<br /><br />It runs for 2 hours, but, man, it felt like 20 minutes; I was screaming for more after that last track. These guys have GOT to pull it together for the fans and put this show on the road (I'm looking at you, ROBERT!!!).<br /><br />You also get (with the Deluxe Edition) a disappointing bonus DVD that has the entire show recorded at their Shepperton Studio dress rehearsal. It's kinda cool to see, but it's a stationary single view camera with poor audio. Almost as bad as all those handheld bootlegs on YouTube of the show that we had to watch up until this release. There's minimal interaction by the band members between songs, and nothing that makes the inclusion of this bonus DVD anything other than the equivalent of another YouTube cell phone video.<br /><br />The packaging and accompanying booklet are fair at best. It's a CD sized fold-out that houses the Blu Ray show, the bonus DVD, and audio of the show on 2 CDs with a booklet that has some brief (but heartfelt) band member comments about the show.<br /><br />But this release is not about the packaging or extras; it's about the perfect, 5-star performance that Led Zeppelin delivered on December 10, 2007 and our ability to now share the experience on Blu Ray in high def awesomeness. It's the Led Zep live Blu Ray release we've all been waiting for. Any Zeppelin fan will enjoy this disk immensely. There is no question here.

0547884591|5.0|Tim's writing has a way of hitting home every time. The part of meta learning alone is worth the price of the book. If you're interested in learning new skills the most efficient way, this book will guide you through this journey. If you're not into cooking books, don't be deceived by the title. It is way more than a cooking book.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As usual, DeMille does not disappoint. The usual plot twists, and you will have difficulty from laughing at loud numerous times - in spite of the very serious story.<br /><br />I have read very DeMille book and always look forward to the next one.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|I saw this concert on TV on PBS a few months ago and just needed the 2 CD and DVD combo. After all these years Sir Paul can still produce and make and sing great music. Who doesn't love Sir Paul. He is definitely a big legend.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 of these books.  Good story and a easy read.  I thought the movie followed pretty close to the first book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter and I really enjoy playing this game together and we can sit on the couch and playing it for hours.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read so far (and I have read a lot since getting my Kindle in August). I was intrigued by the characters and fell in love with Will immediately. Coping with the loss of family is such a heartbreak yet Will was able to move on for the sake of his brother. The author did a great job with Will!<br /><br />Will, unlike the other heroes in books, he was not dominating (to a point being suffocating) and do not have a stalking tendency (which is now highly celebrated in all heroes. It is also nice to see a balanced relationship between the two characters!

B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie does not let down and lives up to the standard she has set. She has some more country-pop songs and slower ballads like we are used to- does not disappoint.
1609611543|1.0|I gave it a full 7 weeks plus a few days.<br /><br />Following the book's advice I completely avoided any wheat and I also made sure to avoid any gluten at all. Not an easy task to do at all!<br /><br />But alas, I have not lost a SINGLE pound during this time. Nothing nada zilch zero.<br /><br />I had some wheat yesterday for first time and felt absolutely no consequences as he seems to warn about - no digestion issues, headaches or anything.<br /><br />Just another bogus diet promise which falls flat on it's face. Add it to the pile.

0399157565|4.0|Although the information on the boat and the sea turtle was interesting I felt like it took a little too long to get to the main plot and I was lost in all the details, especially about the boat.  However, I understand that this may certainly appeal to readers who are boating/sailing enthusiasts.  Though a little slow for me in the beginning, it was not enough to deter me from continuing on and getting to the heart of the book.  I was thrilled to find the old Scarpetta again!  And her interaction with all of the key players, Benton, Marino and Lucy was as it was in the earlier stories and I so missed it!  I LOVE the Scarpetta series, and was worried for awhile when the stories seemed to veer off the road with which I was so familiar.  But I found myself there once again.  Alas, I am always sad when the book has to come to an end.  I find myself reading more slowly and even less pages when I'm getting closer to the end of the book.  LOL.  I look forward to the next Scarpetta case!
0307346617|5.0|This book is great, I am a fan of zombie movies/books/etc. but scare easily. The book was not overly gory or graphic and is greatly written. I have seen the author give a speech at my university (Survival Lessons for the Zombie Apocalypse) and he is hilarious! This is a great book and I highly recommend it, my dad is a fan of the Walking Dead tv series and I got this for him as a birthday gift.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I remember back years ago I bought the Alien Quadrilogy on DVD, and it was the best set for this franchise, completely surpassing the previous box set at the time which was Alien Legacy, and this set takes the quadrilogy to a whole new level.<br /><br />Obviously the biggest improvement is the video and audio clarity, and the transfers on the quadrilogy dvds were spectacular, but of course these transfers are way better, and these are really great movies to show off on blu-ray, because of the sets, the ships, and the creatures, Alien is the one that REALLY shines, especially the shots of the Nostromo in the very beginning, you can see every line, every detail on the exterior of the ship, and the inside looks fantastic as well, this film had a lot of white on the sets, and with this transfer, the sets just come alive, and you get two versions of the film just like in the quadrilogy, I always watch the theatrical cut because it's what I grew up with, but the special edition is good too, and the audio is top notch, it's really loud and crisp, but not overdone, which happens a lot.<br /><br />Now I'm not reviewing the movies themselves because all fans of this franchise knows this is a great saga, now onto Aliens, the transfer on this one is excellent too, right off when you see the shuttle head up into the salvage station, man oh man, the details shown are just incredible, and when Ripley is first taken to the station medical center, those shots of the outside with all the ships flying around the station, oh my, the lights, the ships just stand right out, practically jump off the screen, and the Sulaco mother ship looks outstanding as well as the drop ship, what I said about the transfer on Alien will pretty much sum up all of them, which is pretty amazing seeing that 3 of these films are 20+ years old, and of course you get two versions of this film as well.<br /><br />Now onto Alien 3, I always thought this one was really underrated, it's not on par with Alien or Aliens of course, but on it's own, it's a great film I found, but I'm not reviewing the movies, this transfer is no different than the first 2, it is so clear and crisp, but what really shines about this one is the 2003 restored workprint version, it was featured on the quadrilogy, but it really didn't look or sound that great on the cut scenes, this one however, thanks to blu-ray technology, looks and sounds like the theatrical cut all the way through, it doesn't feel like you're watching two different movies like the DVD version, and while I love the theatrical version, I must say that this time, the extended cut is better, there is more of the story with some key elements that add to the plot, this is the one that should have been the final cut, I don't know why it was edited, the additional scenes add about a half hour.<br /><br />Alien Ressurection is my least favorite of the franchise, but I still find it solid, this one really looks and sounds great, especially the space shots and the interior of the ship, and there is an extended cut of this one too, which is better, although it's only about 10 minutes longer.<br /><br />Then you get to a bunch of excellent extras, first off, all the making of documentaries that were part of the quadrilogy are here as well, which was smart by fox, because they are great documentaries, but with this set, you get extras that weren't part of the quadrilogy if I remember right, like for instance 'The Alien Saga' which is a 2 hour documentary on the franchise, and 'Alien Evolution' which you get 2 versions of, each of which is an hour give or take, 'The Alien Legacy' which is about an hour all on 'Alien' plus a bunch more, theres so many I can't remember all of them.<br /><br />Now the packaging, while the box and the book is absolutely beautiful, the fact that the disks slide in and out it's not something I really like doing, so I put them in some slip cases, everyone has their own preferences, but I personally do not like slidingany kind of disk, I'm always afraid it's going to scratch, but the box is gorgeous.<br /><br />So all in all, this is the best this series has ever looked, and I don't think it will ever look any better, or sound any better, and with all the extras you get, this is a killer box set, and Amazon has it here for $20.00, which is a great buy, I paid $50.00 at Best Buy.<br /><br />So get out there and get it!
B009LK6JS2|1.0|This game seems cool, but it has no tutorial or training level. You start out not knowing how to work anything and they expect you to land, without instruction, on a aircraft carrier. I guess it would be fun if you already know how planes work in real life. But I don't know, so it was frustrating. I never did land that plane. Uninstalled it after about 10 tries.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This series based on the books of Kathy Reichs sticks pretty close to the story line of the books.  So, lovers of the books should also enjoy the show.  It's definitely the best show on current television.  The relationship between Bones and Booth is somuch fun.
0345803485|4.0|This book was very different from any book I ever read before. I started to fall in love with the main carriactures
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This is such a great love story. I hadn't seen the movie yet, as I wanted to read the book first. And now that I've read this and seen the movie, the book was far better. It hooks you in right away, and will have you rooting for Beth and Logan until the end. Amazing read.

B00136JS12|5.0|An album that epitomizes 70s rock. Every song on here is either a classic or at least has received frequent radio play.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Very good book by Patricia Cornwell.  She is one of my favorite writers and this book didn't disappoint at all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|the most addicting thing I have ever done.  people have some of the most interesting ideas. so many great recipes and craft ideas.

031603438X|5.0|Keef is one of a kind for sure, and you will find he's a smart cookie to boot! This book is chock full of awesomeness, and lots of inside scoop. He has a way with words too that is so fun to read. I couldn't put it down!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I would recommend this book if you like a love story that has its ups and downs and is not perfect.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Unfortunately, I would have liked to rate this as EXCEEDED my expectations, but cannot do so in good conscience. It was enjoyable and in my favorite style, 'period drama', but sometimes the characters seemed a bit too predictable, and left me feeling maybe they would improve over time? Characters were a bit two-dimensional. Story line as well. On the positive side, I loved the set and costumes.
0802473156|2.0|This book is a sugar pill. Takes a few valid premises and draws fanciful conclusions; takes its metaphors so seriously that you start to wonder if the author believes in the literal existence of a \\"love tank\\" that causes teenagers to misbehave if their parents fail to fill it up. It's absolutely true that people have different ways of communicating love and receiving love. Doing the laundry can be a supremely romantic overture and characterizing particular behaviors/activities as ones love language is a great way for partners to increase the level of satisfaction in their relationship if their \\"languages\\" are adequately compatible to start with. Clearly written for a specific audience (i.e. Christian and heterosexual)--and Lord knows this type of marriage needs plenty of help, what with the institution being under attack and all--but there are much better, comprehensive, science-based approaches to couples therapy and what creates healthy and strong marriage and family relationships out there; one therapist's perceived 'success' rate even over a period of 30 years, especially if his clientele are mostly from the same demographic, is not something I would trust to protect my greatest treasure. That said, the placebo effect can be extremely powerful and if it makes you feel better, who cares if it's a sugar pill?
1439152802|4.0|Engaging story with fully developed characters. A real page-turner! The kind of book you look forward to snuggling in to bed at night to read.
B00979CS50|5.0|The magic is back with Neil and Crazy Horse on this CD. \\"Walk like a giant\\" is an epic of a track, and channels David Briggs production brilliance. The songs really stay with you, \\"Drifting back\\" is the best driving song I've heard in a long time. There is a pure rawness to the music the Horse create with Neil, and Magic is one way to describe it.  John Hanlon deserves recognition for re-creating the true sound and spirit of Neil with Crazy Horse.
B003REGM3A|5.0|I liked this album the first time I gave it a spin, and have since realized it gets better each time I listen. Kudos to Cyndi for her very fine choices of traditional blues favorites and for the excellent skill in which she interprets them into her own sassy style. I would love to see her get with a great songwriter such as Gary Nicholson to develop a project with her doing some original Lauper blues, done in the classic styles but her own lyrics and messages brought out. I think the blues and Cyndi go hand in glove, so lets have some more, but not so many covers! Please?
B000KJU1HI|5.0|Purchased this DVD for a friend for Christmas; he is a big Dylan fan; he found it entertaining. Great product for the Dylan fan.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This package is amazing!<br /><br />I could not have imagined Led Zeppelin to sound and perform this well in 2007. The high definition transfer is stunning on Blu Ray. The energy and chemistry onstage is perfect. The set list is to die for. To have the CDs and the Blu Ray and the bonus DVD in one clean and compact, beautifully presented digipak, is a bargain to me. I will be watching and listening to this over and over, long after the holidays have passed. Thank you Led Zeppelin, for this gift in 2012. This version of Dazed and Confused is the best I've heard live! Buy it!
B00005N6KG|4.0|Bought them to be able to watch TV at the gym, cheap, small and light...<br /><br />Happy with the sound quality and comfort.  Problem with the cord length.  Not long enough to plug into the connection on the ARC Trainer at the gym and still move. Note the short cord lenght and know that if the connection is below your waist, this is probably not long enough for you to still move without tugging these off you head.  Works fine for an ipod that I can wear and the short cord doesn't get caught up in the equipment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can not put these books down. I keep reading them over and over. I can't wait for the authors next book.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Who knew that flinging a jellyfish around would be so much fun! Teach the jellyfish how to \\"fly\\" (bounce) and catch the water drops and feathers. Very addicting!
B004LROMWU|5.0|Great show, we missed the original season so we wanted to catch up on this season and we're glad we did!!
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Took me 3 sittings to get through. Didn't enjoy it as much as i expected. Expected more from Daniel Day Lewis. Not his best work.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was suspenseful right up until the end.  Good mystery.  Fast, enjoyable read. I had no idea where the book was going.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is too cool for words. You will love seeing the interesting things people post, and learn about a myriad of topics that you never even knew you had an interest in.  This is a must have app.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham always writes books that I really enjoy reading.  This one is no different.  It kept me wondering until the last page.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Loved the movie.. if for nothing else but the Music! It was a good movie and the music made it Great! I even went out and bought the Blu Ray and 2 copies of the Sound Track so I could have one at home and one for my husband's car. Rock will never die!!! Thankfully!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I really like this show.  I have the first two seasons, and I could watch them over and over.  I appreciate that Amazon does not have commercials.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Superb acting, wonderful plots and as funny as it is heart warming.  This movie is a definite keeper in our family.
0525952926|2.0|Winter World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy confirmed my assessment of Book One, mediocre in story line and writing style. The characters are one dimensional and stereotypical characterizations of period culture. The author's attempt to force the main characters to intersect across a global setting  and time span are forced, uninteresting and not very believable.<br /><br />A disappointing effort from a usually good writer.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put it down... the only complaint was that I read it in three days, could not stop reading once I started, and it did not last ....  perhaps one of Grisham's best efforts
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've done no research to find out about this author's history, but I can say that if he's done nothing else, his success as a writer is only now being realized. Though I'll always want to read something rather than watch it, I have to say I'm desperately hoping that this turns into a movie or well done miniseries!  Get the nicely-priced omnibus and read like the wind!<br />-Frazier
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|like new!!  no problems with it at all.  Great picture and sound quality.  My son loves it,, its his favorite pasttime
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is the new obsession with all my friends!  It was a thrilling read that had me rushing through but wishing to savor every bit slowly. The vernacular and style are impeccable and this novel is its own unique genre. I had no idea what was coming, and loved every part of the journey. Get it now or as a gift, you'll be thankful as will they. I envy all the readers just beginning this book.<br />-Ali West
B004EPYZV2|5.0|After reading the reviews of the others in this series on BluRay, I can only say it is a shame that they didn't put the effort into them that they did with Ghost Protocol.<br /><br />I don't write critiques of acting and plot summary, just a review of the quality of the video and audio transfer itself.  When I first got the set, I accidentally put in the Standard Def version and watched the whole thing, all while bitching that it sounded horrible and didn't look all that great.  Not until it was over did I realize my mistake, so this review comes after a month or so of waiting to see the movie again properly this time.  Never the less, it displays how incredibly different a film can look and sound on Blu Ray as compared to Standard Def when the transfer is done correctly.<br /><br />The video transfer is exceptional in all areas.  The skin tones are just perfect and there is no stair-stepping, aliasing or artifacts of any kind that I could see.  No grain either producing some of the most excellent imaging you are likely to see on a Blu Ray DVD anywhere.  There is great detail in the darker scenes and shadows and a perfectly clear transfer.  The video is definitely DEMO worthy and I don't say that about too many BluRay DVDs.<br /><br />The Audio, a lossless Dolby HD 7.1, which I listened to on a fairly esoteric 5.1 audio system, can easily be recommended to use as a DEMO disc to show off your system.  The use of the discreet channels is marvelous with exceptional panning from the front to the rears and visa versa as well as many, many examples of discreet channel usage for both the front and rears.  If I had to nit pick, I might say that the soundtrack itself, not the Foley FX, was sometimes a touch too loud, but this was surely the producers/editors intention.  Obviously, in a movie like this, your sub LFE channel will get a workout as well.<br /><br />It would be hard to declare a complete winner between the audio and video as they both are the stars so let's just call it an exceptional draw.<br /><br />Again, a shame that I can't upgrade my standard def DVDs of Mission Impossible 2 & 3 to Blu Ray as they don't make the mark.  However, Ghost Protocol certainly does and I highly recommend it for those wanted a superb quality transfer.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankscall it an exceptional draw.<br /><br />Again, a shame that I can't upgrade my standard def DVDs of Mission Impossible 2 & 3 to Blu Ray as they don't make the mark.

B0096PAA6E|5.0|Amazing CD. Quite eclectic and was initially put off by a few more 'pop'  sounding songs. Yet upon listening to the CD more I quickly appreciated the diverse talent of this artist. Particularly his rippin' guitar solos!!
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I am an avid reader of many different types of books.  I have about 300 books on my kindle reader now and have had it for about two years.  There are many books that come and go with little or no memory of them on my part.  &#34;Of Mice and Men,&#34; will never be one of those forgotten text.  The story speaks to every American who has had to fight poverty and the restrictions it puts on free will and good decision making skills.  Read it enjoy it; It is truly an American story that will live forever.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Reading this book during the time I watched the uninteresting election returns was delightful.  I didn't want it to be over because i enjoyed it so much.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Love this movie!!! Got it very quickly!!! I have no complaints as far as how good the movie works. Will b ordering again soon
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Well, here are the details:<br />- Kristen Stewart was poorly cast for the role and might be the most overrated actress of our time.  She carries no gravity, and was utterly uncompelling in this film.<br />- Chris Hemsworth has the acting chops and the look, but the poor script made his lines sound flat, forced, and at times, a little hokey.<br />-  Charlize Theron was superb, and yet underused, leaving her character painfully unrealized.<br />-  The writers didn't seem to know how to end it, leaving you with an anticlimactic ending.<br />- Whatever you do, do not view this within a year of watching The Lord Of The Rings.  Actually, don't bother viewing it at all.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|App is good,but the solicitation for feedback is veeery intrusive. It has become a burden<br />,to the point that I had to write this fcr the app to work. I hope.
B009E3EYS8|4.0|Just like a teenager, I had to have this puppy on the day of it's release, just as I have done for every Zep release since Zoso came out when I was in high school.<br /><br />The audience looks awfully young, so I thought that they must have slipped in some old footage of fans from the seventies. Then the reality set in for me. Most of the fans my age are probably dead, in jail, or like myself, did not want to fly all the way to London only to have some loadie throw up on you. I wisely waited for this inevitable DVD release, but I am wondering why it took almost five years. Better late than never.<br /><br />In the order of appearance, there are six stellar cuts for me: In My Time Of Dying, For Your Life, Nobody's Fault But Mine, Dazed And Confused, Kashmir, and Whole Lotta Love. These alone are worth the cost of this single DVD with double CD package. I only bought it for the DVD and skipped the version with the bonus DVD rehearsals (thank you, fellow Amazon reviewers!). The chemistry between these four musicians is truly incredible and one would never guess that they had not played together in many decades. The filming is very well done.<br /><br />So why only four stars? First, I have always hated Trampled Underfoot since the day it was released. It marred an otherwise perfect Physical Grafitti back when it was first released and almost ruins this show for me. However, it falls under the \\"must include\\" category that Plant refers to before Dazed And Confused, since Trampled was a moderate dance hit played in bars with the likes of KC & The Sunshine Band (yuk!). Then, I really looked forward to one of my favorite Zep songs, Misty Mountain Hop. Much to my horror, the hypnotic rhythm guitars that made that song back then are replaced by an atrocious keyboard part from John Paul Jones. I wanted to cringe at this butchery! However, these two low spots can be skipped over when watching it and this package is still well worth the money spent.<br /><br />I could only hope that they could one day record some new material, but something tells me that this O2 show was a once in a lifetime event. Enjoy it forever on a shoestring budget!that they could one day record some new material, but something tells me that this O2 show was a once in a lifetime event.

B0095T3H2U|2.0|not very good. over the top in parts and way too long. usually like jason segal, but this one was a bit of a bust
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|As usual, the British television has come up with a superb series with a superb cast. Anyone who is<br />tired of the &#34;stuff&#34; that American television calls acting and drama should try this and Upstairs Downstairs,<br />if they haven't already done so. I can't wait for the next part of the series coming out in 2013
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I revived the cutter on a Friday late afternoon.  The cutter part was not in the box.  Could not get ahold of anyone until Monday.  The company next dayed the cutter.  Using the cutter on wine bottles.  Not very easy to get a great cut.  Have lost 6 out of 10 bottles .  The info they give you works but if your score is not perfect your bottle will turn out with cracks & will not break smooth.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Mr. Anderson is in a world spiral of his own. I love his movies just because it is him. The actors rise above themselves without ego and their little nuances always cement a classic. Mr. Anderson is almost the' Star Trek Anti Matter' of Mr.Tarantino. Both are beyond our dreams and visions with regards to a reality. It's a lot like Yossarian in 'Catch-22' - 'Everyone is trying to kill me, they are trying to kill everyone, Yossarian&#34;. Don't try and kill fresh minds and old hands, otherwise, we are all going to fade to beige. I loved this movie, I paid for this movie and whilst Mr. Anderson and Mr. Murray have a breath in their lungs, I will love and always watch any film they might make.  Please TMZU 2? Tarantino and Anderson Colaboration, how scary is that. lol!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is the first Grisham book in a long time that was as exciting to read as The Firm all those many years ago. Just as with The Firm (and much other fiction of this ilk), you has to suspend disbelief a bit, but if you do you are in for a good, page turning, yarn with all sorts of twists and turns (including a few that I did not see coming at all.)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|some of his books are hard to follow but this was great.....i read it in one day....i really enjoy j. grishams book...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Only just started this book but absolutely love it as all DeMille books.  The John Corey character is engaging and incredibly humorous.  Slowing down my read because  I love is so much and want this story to last.<br /><br />Thank you Nelson!
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I loved the CD.  It had a great variety of types of music on it and makes<br />for great easy listening music.  I did not care to much for the opera<br />because I have never been a big fan of that type of music but it<br />is O.K
1401322786|2.0|The book starts off pretty slow.  The book is pretty short so it could be finished in a day or two. I felt the moral of the story was good though the characters were kind of one dimensional. I would suggest getting this from the library rather than owning it.
0060920084|2.0|I ran through this book as joylessly as Bryson ran through this country.<br /><br />Here, in his words, is a summary of this road trip: \\"Flat and dull\\". . .\\"brown flatness\\". . .\\"FIREWORKS!\\". . .\\"dangerously uninhabitable (shacks). . .\\"South Carolina was boring\\". . .\\"all was squalor again\\". . .\\"New York scared me.\\". . .\\" That is a fair summary of his trip (and his travel writing) from Iowa east, southeast, northeast to New York. I was losing interest. Yet, he was entering New England now and my home state, Connecticut. I read on as Bryson drove east. . .\\"Soon I was in the suburbs of Hartford, and then in Hartford itself, and then in the suburbs on the other side of Hartford. And then I was in Rhode Island. . .Was that really all there was to Connecticut?\\" I lost further interest. . .<br /><br />Bryson, however disappointing his travelogue, is a sharp and funny wit. I thought his trip foolish, but not his observations of his shed country. When he speaks about America and its people turning treasure into trinkets, when he speaks about the intellect of American youth--\\"stupid as pig dribble\\", his voice demands attention. And so, I finished the trip with him.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was a very pleasing movie to watch.  The screenplay was well written with an unusual theme and setting, and quirky twists and turns.  The actors were very professional- actually some of the best in the field.  Lastly, the movie put me in a great mood.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I was planning on ordering this until I did more research.  I will go ahead and add to the many \\"they're not the extended episodes\\" rants.  I will not be buying this boxed set on principle.  I refuse to pay for less content.  I am in the process of collecting FRIENDS on DVD, and that will have to do.  If the extended episodes are released on Blu Ray, I will be all over that.  But not before then.  You miss far too many priceless jokes by going with the edited episodes.<br /><br />What a shame.
0316017930|5.0|I bought this book for my son, who will be reading it this year in his high school psychology class. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. Mr. Gladwell presents some very intriguing insights into success that I had never before considered. The book is well written, making it interesting and easy to read. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to expand their thinking.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Good movie, great 3D transfer!! The current best of my collection and my &#34;Show Off&#34; disc..The long wait for this 3D Blu-Ray to be released was worth the wait..
B004AFFZNI|5.0|When the water proof housing is not needed and dust is not a concern, I highly recommend this housing for anyone who desires quick access to all the ports on both side of the camera, or uses an external mic in order to improve sound quaility.<br />I use the Sony ECM-DS70P Electret Condenser Stereo Microphone with this housing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Hard to put this down. Zusak's style of writing & use of words are  outstanding! It had me in tears one minute & smiling the next. Truly I book I will not forget & tell others about
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I'm typically not into the recent vampire craze.  No offense to Twilight fans, but it just doesn't appeal to me.  Decided to watch this on a whim while getting mindless tasks done around the house, and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm also not a huge fan of violence and though there was some gratuitous blood, it wasn't overly disturbing.  The premise, though far-fetched, weaved in enough real historical events to make me think, yeah, maybe.  Just don't tell my absolutely fabulous U.S. history teachers that.  Now I kind of wish I had read the book first, because I usually try to do that with books made into movies, but I just didn't think I'd be interested enough.  I might go back and try because it really is a creative story.  I liked all of the actors, the portrayal of real people was interesting (particularly Mary Todd, I thought), the plot moved well, it was easy to follow, and there were some interesting twists and turns.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game on the kindle fire is dope. its addiction is the equivalent of heroin. when I wake up I'm like &quot;how many coins do I get today&quot; lol great game.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|There wasn't much innovation in this movie. I understand that it is a prequel for alien series but it was less than impressive due to a lack of originality in numerous concepts it was trying to sell. It was disappointing despite its pretty visual effects.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|While I am not an extreme Twi-Hard, I do enjoy the books and movies, so I began buying the soundtracks. I especially like them as they've brought my attention to indie artists I wouldn't know about otherwise, and the BDP2 soundtrack is no exception. Overall, it might be my favorite, as most of the CDs have multiple songs that I tend to skip over, but I enjoy almost every song on the BDP2 album. I probably could have done without a repeat of \\"A Thousand Years\\" by Christina Perry, but it's not a big deal. I think what makes this CD work is that the songs have a good order and flow to them, which really helps.<br /><br />As for those who think that Green Day will sound out of place (I was skeptical myself), I find them to fit in nicely with the overall mood of the soundtrack.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I really enjoy playing The Haunt and The Haunt 2.  They are both great games and I keep playing them.  I am hoping they come up with another game (The Haunt 3) soon.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|It was the blurb that first got my interest and the free sample was the bait that got me hooked to this brilliant book.<br /><br />The style is unique and one that I haven't come across before but it works remarkably well. At times you do feel like you're reading an actual historic account of real events and that \\"real\\" factor was the best part of this book.<br /><br />I think this will appeal to anyone apprehensive about the Zombie genre as a good introduction.<br /><br />I hope the movie doesn't ruin or take away from the essence of the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first series I read. I loved it so much read the Molly Fyde series too.  I highly recommend to everyone.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|I just recently started watching Criminal Minds with interest and now I can catch up on past seasons using my Kindle Fire. I love the fact I don't have to buy a whole season
0525478817|5.0|This book is too amazing to even put into words.  John Green's ability to bring characters to life is shown in this impeccable novel.  It is by far the best book I have ever read, and I recommend to everyone to read it.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|This is a nice app to have but it stops working frequently. It's not really worth having if it always needs fixing.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Game is a lot of fun and starts to challenge you right from the beginning of the game. The puzzles are entertaining and definitely provide a challenge, yet are fairly intuitive and don't really need any explanation. The one thing that I wish the game included was some method of note taking. I'll find a solution to a puzzle elsewhere in the house and would love to have some way of jotting it down.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You is AWSOME!! I couldn´t stop reading!!! You won´t be dissapointed.The story keeps getting better.<br /><br />I can´t wait for the third book.

B009CF3P7E|5.0|Awesome movie! I an not a total trekkie but the story and set makes sense to me. One of my fave movies!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I truly love NCIS and this season was great!  The NCIS family has its quirks like any other family, but the show continues to hold the viewer's attention with meaningful plot development.  The storylines are not only suspenseful, but they are often inspirational.  Everyone has relationship problems unless they live in a vacuum, and the characters of NCIS show the ups and downs that they face while still remaining true to the basic premise of the show--to entertain.  I look forward to future episodes and I know that I won't be disappointed.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|It really works just as stated and the battery status is allways shown in the header.  A good do all device.
B000VCLGBY|5.0|This is one of favorite feel good movies. I even named my dog bruiser LOL<br />Reese Whitherspoon is just adorable in this movie. I have loved her since her first movie<br />Man in the Moon.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I didn't read enough reviews on this before I bought it, but honestly I probably would have bought it anyway.  I have read every DeMille book and count many of them to be amongst my favorite fiction books.  However, count me with the many that think this one is really weak.  DeMille's sense of humor is one of the things I have enjoyed so much about his books.  In this book Corey has a smart remark after literally every single comment anyone makes.  Books like the Gold Coast and other Corey novels would have you immersed in the plot and then hit you with a funny line out of the blue that would make you really laugh.  When you start expecting a wisecrack after every single paragraph, it starts to remind you of talking to a know-it-all that just won't shut up.  That is my biggest complaint and the reason I struggled to get through this one.  It is relentless.<br />To me, DeMille books always have three things I really enjoy.  One is a great feel for the setting where the story takes place.  I always learn a lot about wherever the story is set.  He takes care of that well here with Yemen.  The second is some truly suspenseful plots that keep the pages flying.  Not so much here.  The third is the humor, which is the biggest turn-off here for me and is just terribly overdone.<br />If you haven't read any DeMille, there are about 15 others you should read before this one.  Some are really great.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i use this app evry morning 2 wake up 4 school so the best sound is the rooster bcuz its the only one that will wke me up!(: so use and i really like lol have fun!(: came on kindle fire hehehe!(: trust my opinion!(:
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Be careful what you wish for...Brave is a very neat story with moral lessons. To be strong, a family needs to stand by each other. It was a nice way to show the kids about the importance of families by watching Brave altogether.
B007QXU0ZO|2.0|I picked up this CD last June with great anticipation - I ADORE \\"Up from Below\\" and Alex Ebert's solo effort, so my expectations were admittedly high. But after repeated efforts to like it, I just find it disappointing.<br /><br />The opening notes are promising, but then the CD slogs through a low-energy, low-inspiration set. I almost jumped with the first notes of \\"Fiya Wata\\" temporarily raised the tempo on my first listen, but this song isn't exactly a surprise -- it's been on their tour list for years! So, call it a sophomore slump, but this is a frustratingly forgettable effort from a band that really set a high bar for itself with its debut CD. Unless you're a completist, skip the CD and pick up the MP3 of the opening track. If you're looking for an alternative Edward Sharpe fix, go download their iTunes live studio mini-set -- very nice, and it includes a leaner, better live studio version of Fiya Wata. If you don't have Alex's solo CD, buy it!<br /><br />Waiting for the next one from these guys with optimism..! Hopefully, the Zeros will hit it out of the park on the next one..?
0062127241|5.0|I have been a fan of The Who since the early seventies but, I honestly did not know that much about the history of the band and its members. My daughter me gave this book a few weeks ago for my birthday and I was looking forward to reading it. I anticipated learning more about influences, on both Mr.Townsend and other members of the band, that led to such a great collection of music over the past 50 years.<br /><br />As it turned out, last week we took a last minute opportunity to see The Who perform Quadraphenia.  I decided to read the book the next day. I didn't put it down until late in the evening when I was done.I enjoyed the historical perspective that this book provided. I have read a lot of \\"Rock Slock\\" and this book was not like that. I think Mr. Townsend puts himself out there and I thoroughly enjoyed the perspective from which he provides details about his lifes journey. He truly is a great muscian and it was interesting to get some insight into his creative process.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|How can a book keep me entertained enough to finish, while simultaneously making me hate the story that is being told?  Ask George Martin.  The characters never quite get there.  As soon as I begin to enjoy them, they're gone.  I should have been warned by the series title that the real story is about the futility of politics (duh) and not wasted my time, but, alas, I'm an idiot in search of a good story to read.
B0087HT36U|5.0|An enjoyable game that can help pass the time.  Recommend it to anyone who likes similar games. Being able to directly aim is another bonus.
B00003CXA6|5.0|My husband has been reading about Gettysburg.  He was moved by the quality of the movie showing the hardships people faced.
B00005JLR2|5.0|My nieces really loved this movie was very colorful and full of adventure would recommend this movie to any child who loves adventure
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I like vampire movies. I like Johnny Depp. I'm old enough to have watched the original Dark Shadows daytime soap. Unfortunately, this movie was as stupid as the old soap. Depp was his typical character self.... but I have to say....just didn't like it.
B003TH14H4|5.0|My wife and I loved season 1 and were looking forward to season 2. And it didn't disappoint! The writing is great, the actors are well cast, and it just the right blend of silly and drama. We look forward to season 3.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|lots of action, and great picture and sound quality .. definitly reccomend this movie to everyone!!! Love amazon instant movies!
B000056VJ7|5.0|The title says it all .. this album is definitely one of the best ever released and it's clear to see the reason why it has consistently been in the top 5 best selling albums of all time.<br /><br />Back in September, I got a new car and traded in my old one.  I made sure to take all of my CDs and things out of the old one.  I got into my new car and went to fire up Meat Loaf on my new Bose speakers.... and the case was empty.  I had left it in the CD player.  Top 10 saddest days of my life.<br /><br />I just couldn't live without this CD and came right onto Amazon and purchased it that night so I could rock out to it again.  It's that good.<br /><br />By now, you know all of the songs... Bat Out of Hell, Paradise By the Dashboard Light, Two out of Three Ain't Bad, Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth, etc.  You can't really go wrong.  Each song brings something unique to the table and I love how there are basically chapters to each song.  As you listen, you can see the story unfolding before you.  I personally enjoy envisioning a rock-opera unfolding before my eyes, which is fitting because the songs were actually written to be part of one!<br /><br />If you love classic rock, this is a no-brainer.  Even if that genre isn't your cup of tea, give the songs a shot!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I saw this movie in the movies and have rented it several times love the characters, playing the roles of Holmes and Watson.  I did however, purchase this item by mistake, as I was trying to purchase Sherlock Holmes Game of Shadows.  I have not opened this product as of yet, will give as a gift.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read this book in 2 days.  It was great.  Love John Grisham novels.  Need more. One of my very favorite authors,  this book was a page turner, kept you guessing and oh the ending!! Wow
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very well-written book. Highly entertaining and mysterious, frustrating and captivating. The author's descriptions of scenery, smells, feelings and character emotions were done is such a way that the reader is able to envision the events in the book as if they are living through the moments themselves. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good winter read full of thrills and strange turns along the way.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't get enough! Wish there were more. Read all three (twice) within a couple weeks. Couldn't put it down!<br />Not for the faint of heart.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love pinterest - and the app on kindle makes me pin more! Ah I wish it wasn't there because I spend way to much time on it
B003L77GGK|5.0|The video arrived very quickly and in great condition.  I love Supernatural and was very excited to receive this c.d.  I have not watched the entire season just yet but have been pleased with the quality thus far.
B004SBULWE|1.0|This didn't work properly so I ended up deleting it. It works great on droid phones, but not on the kindle
B0083TU56E|5.0|Love this author! Book is a must  have for your kids library and I enjoy it as much as my son.
B004TMPJP6|3.0|This product works great on my other devices but it was a little glitchy for the kindle. I still have it and use it, but sometimes it's irritating.
B003ZLV8T8|5.0|If you have not seen this movie it is a must see. It's not just another chick flick, it's funny and very well acted.
034580404X|5.0|These books are so great. If you want a good, ridiculous read.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart - this series is an incredible journey of two people -with an ending i Love.
B009GX7IRA|1.0|NCIS is my favorite show and I missed the first epidode of this season.  Thought I could catch up by purchasing it for my Kindle.  Wrong...restarted 4 or 5 times and finally gave up.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really didn't like Evernote that much until I downloaded the Kindle app. It works awesome and syncs great! I love it
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|I love this original movie. Its in Spanish and uses subtitles but this is THE original version of quarantine. I love the mood, the spontaneous in your face style and the moody sets. I feel this is the start of a great series. I own REC 2 and 3 and am happy to have bought the starter DVD. This movie is the best first person home video style horror movies made. Plus I love the ultra violent style of the ( I guess their sort of like Zombies ) mannerisms
B0071T5PN0|5.0|Nice to hear Eddie shredding again.  Reminds me a little bit of Van Halen of old, early Van Halen, the reason you listened to VH in the first place.  Diggin' this album!
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I just love the Invicta 1514 I Force Collection Chronograph Stop Watch that I recently purchased from Amazon.<br />The price was right, the product is a quality time piece and smart looking too.  Everyone compliments me on this gorgeous watch.<br />I am very happy I choose this Invicta Watch.  Search Amazon for your next watch.  You'll be pleased with the vast<br />selections and outstanding prices.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The series is amazing and thrilling. I recommend this for anyone who loves gore and zombie related stuff. Great plot and action in every corner
B00A9Q70Y4|3.0|Half-way through season 3, I kind of feel like it has gotten a bit tired and run-of-the-mill, and I no longer care all that much what is going to happen on the show anymore... at least not enough to pay for more episodes. It's like a cross between Gilligan's Island and Planet of the Apes (or Omega Man maybe), but with zombies.
0547884591|5.0|Couldn't wait to get my hands on this one! I expect nothing but the best from Ferriss and he delivered once again. Informative, simplified, and entertaining. He makes the impossible or complicated easily mastered by following his steps. Beautiful layout as well! Time to get cooking...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|takes a long time<br />good game<br />I like it alot<br />play every day<br />addicting<br />on level 40<br />I like to get prizes
1587613379|4.0|I gave it a 4 star because it is a little bit off putting to those who do not already have an interest in alternative relationship structures and/or sexual behavior. For those of us who do, this is amazing advice and definitely a helpful companion.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I love the Cosmonaut Stylus because it mimics drawing with a marker. I am used to the wide grip from using artist markers, so having the same feel in a stylus is very comforting. The rubbery texture, and weight of the product feel good in your hand.
B008B11R1Q|3.0|The first album was honestly too minimal for me to enjoy for repeated listens. I need drums at least on half the album, and I didn't get that the first go round. Coexist takes the momentum Jamie xx gathered on all the remixes and side-projects he had a hand in between albums and made a solid though slow at times album. The melodies are way more catchier than on their debut, while the productions seem more polished (I would say, finished, even) making this album satisfying after the first listen. Because of the minimalist approach of their songs, which a lot seem like they could have been freestyled, its hard to hear a song that represents the sound of the album. The first two tracks represent most of what the album presents and there aren't many surprises from there.<br /><br />The most gratifying surprise comes on the song &#34;Reunion&#34; which starts in standard fair but slowly breaks down into something reminiscent of 90's house and is my favorite track on the album. I also enjoyed the gratuitous amount of bass slathered on this album. It was the kind that made Jamie's version of Gil Scott-Heron's I'm New Here very enjoyable that I enjoyed hearing on this release.<br /><br />I gave this a 3 even though I really liked it because it made me want a electronic/house styled album from The xx instead of what was given. I can respect leaving the listener wanting more but not wanting something else. I am a big fan of Jamie's work and this is a great follow up that makes me anticipate what they do next even more.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This dvd is a family favorite! I am very pleased that I was able to purchase this in such good condition and recieve it in such a timely manner!
B002Q02FS2|5.0|I listen to a lot of hip-hop and classic soul, so when I first got introduced to this group through &#34;What's a Girl To Do&#34; I wasn't sure what to make of it but I dug it. That is kinda how I describe their music to people since it touches several genres while being a tight musical concept of its own.<br /><br />Even though they had a tendency to over-produce the music, they did it with great results on this album. I bought the Special Edition almost exclusively for their cover of Tom Wait's &#34;Lonely&#34;. It was beautiful, dynamic and one of those songs I can listen to over and over in any mood.<br /><br />The build up of &#34;Siren Song&#34; is one of the most perfect compositions that exhibits almost everything I really enjoy about their production elements and Natasha Khan's voice. I also appreciate her toning down the D&D visuals that alienated me from truly falling in love with the first album.<br /><br />Favorite Songs: Glass, Siren Song, Pearl's Dream, The Big Sleep, A Forest (Cover) & LONELY (Cover)
B009FO96ZC|5.0|This album definitely stands out not because of John McLaughlin's playing or Gary Husband's piano work. But the solid Rhythm section of Etienne and Ranjit. Amazing complex time signatures on Trancefusion kick start things off and provide a fantastic canvas for John and Gary to brush on. Unfortunately,  John McLaughlin doesnt completely use the blazing rhythm section to build some stand out tunes. Dont get me wrong there are pieces of brilliance throughout and John is jazz God. The songs that stood out for me are Trancefusion and Guitar Love.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I usually read the reviews before I will buy a book from an author I dont know and after reading the reviews I was still unsure.  Then I saw how long it was and thought to myself, \\"At least this one will last a while\\".  Boy was I wrong.  I couldnt put it down, so yes it did last longer than usual, but after finishing it I had to agree with all the other reviews.  This is one of the best books I have read.  I love the characters and did not want the book to end. I want more.  I cant say anything bad about this book...except that there isnt another one in my hand right now.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I have all their albums and thoroughly enjoy all of them. This one is no different. I highly recommend it.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|except for the hot bodies and fine faces this movie is so stupid, has the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie
B008NW67E0|5.0|Just as awesome as their first album. If you like Dave Matthews or the like then I highly recommentd it.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|this was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law and she watched it right away and she absolutely loved it.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|It has been a long time since they put out an album...but it is totally worth the wait...highly recommend it.
B0060D0OWA|5.0|Graphics were great, the story line priceless ... is a great move about doing the right thing even if it hurts ..
B009T3AHDE|4.0|I saw last week \\"Cosmopolis\\" here in Brasil in Blu-ray. It is an excellent movie. The dialogues are the best things. They capture your attention with the complement of the slow and beautiful scenes. I will rent Cosmopolis again ! Don't miss it !!!
B006OAB3ME|1.0|I guess McCartney did rock better.  The songs were great but I didn't like his renditions.  I'd like my money back.
B007704PRU|5.0|A great series to add to your wish list if you enjoyed the matched series and hunger games series. Great for young adults and older
B007XCH15K|5.0|I re-bought this album for the track Samantha made with Clivilles and Cole, 'Pleasure Zone' and for the brilliant rework of 'That's What Love Can Do' and the bonus 'A Second Chance'. I've been interested in this artist for her work with PWL and Full Force also. Something tells me there may have been a bit of re-recording with 'That's What Love Can Do'. Samantha's vocals sound clearer and stronger, or it could just be a case of great use of the latest studio technology. Everything Cherry Pop has delivered has been fantastic to date , from an 80's music lover's perspective! I look forward to the release of 'Sequal' the deluxe edition (in a few days). I also hope that Matt-Pop can continue to recreate and produce more material (and I love the extra vocals). He's an outstanding artist.<br /><br />Buy and enjoy this album, it's worth it!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I liked this book so much I am reading another book<br />By the same author and am enjoyong it kust as much
B006O6F932|4.0|When my Monster High High School Playset came in the mail I admit to doing a bit of a happy dance. As I sat down at the dinner table to put it together my husband passed by and took a look at it. \\"I feel like I'm 5 years old and finally got that Ewok Village playset I wanted\\", I commented to which he laughed and then exited. Why did I get that nostalgic rush? Because this is the playset every Monster High fan is going to want.<br /><br />It definitely has some design flaws, as these kind of sets often do. I'm not a big fan of the columns/gargoyles that attach to the front. I couldn't get them to stay put if I moved the set at all. The pumpkins that hang on the spiderwebs look so cute on the side but hang wrong on the balconey. You can't close the set without removing most of the stuff (desks, table, lab cart, etc.) and the casketball hoop. Younger children might find some of that frustrating. I also had several of the little purple pegs that hold the floor of the creepeteria area pop out.<br /><br />Putting aside the little annoying flaws it's such a cute playset! The lockers have little skull 'locks' you can use to keep them shut. The DJ station flips over and becomes a trophy case that includes the Spirit Stick from the webisodes. It's definitely all about the little details (a creepy hand holds up the pink skullette disco ball for example) that fans of the dolls, but especially the webisodes and TV specials, will recognize.<br /><br />As an adult collector I adore the playset but in all honesty it might not be as fun for actual kids. It's not very big which is great for portability, yet doesn't allow for great play with a group of children trying to have their dolls in it at once. There are a lot of tiny accessories to lose and the stickers don't actually have anywhere special to go. If you can catch it for 25-30% off the retail you'll probably be much happier than paying full price.<br /><br />On the whole it's a great addition to any MH lover's collection that might need some parental help if for a younger user. It's cute, clever and certain to be one of the most sought after toys this holiday season!might need some parental help if for a younger user. It's cute, clever and certain to be one of the most sought after toys this holiday season!
B000001F6N|5.0|\\"A Hard Road is a 1967 electric blues album recorded by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers featuring Peter Green on lead guitar, John McVie on bass, Aynsley Dunbar on drums and John Almond. Tracks 5, 7 and 13 feature the horn section of Alan Skidmore and Ray Warleigh. Peter Green sings lead vocals on \\"You Don't Love Me\\" and \\"The Same Way.\\" The notable instrumental track \\"The Supernatural\\", a guitar improvisation in the key of D minor, has much in common with Peter Green's later hit composition \\"Black Magic Woman\\".\\"<br /><br />The majority of the tunes were written by Mayall except covers of tunes by Freddie King,Sonny Thompson,Elmore James,Jimmy Lee Robinson,Dan Burley/Lionel Hampton, Mel London/Junior Wells,Johnny Guitar Watson,& Marshall Paul.<br /><br />This is a legendary recording as it puts together two of the periods most noteworthy figures, John Mayall and Peter Green. It was only a year but in that time a wealth of recordings were produced. Green was filling in for Clapton at the time, but when he quit this left the door wide open for Green who had easily established himself in the interim.<br /><br />Green moved on later in 1967 to launch Fleetwood Mac taking John Mcvie and Mick Fleetwood with him who had later replaced Aynsley Dunbar on drums.<br /><br />This double CD is a treat with the original \\"Hard Road\\" 14 songs and an additional 22 more tracks from 1969-1971 releases, \\"Looking Back\\" and \\"Thru The Years\\".<br /><br />The Bluesbreaker's launched many a successful career and Mayall to this day is performing relentlessly remaining one of the world's foremost blues authorities.
B0015AARJI|2.0|The review says \\"Game\\", but it is the controller.  We purchased this wireless controller back in June and it came out of the packaging VERY STIFF.  It didn't work very well.  We thought it was just new and needed broken in.  We thought it would loosen up with play.  It is November and husband still hates the horrid controller. It has very SLOW reaction time and trying to run in Black OPS is almost impossible. We purchased another one to see if it will be better.  If it is stillstiff when it comes out of the box we will return it right away!  It is too late to return the controller, but we hope this next one we just ordered will be better and work properly!  Will update.
B001DHXT20|3.0|While technically well-done and an enjoyable one to watch, this is probably the weakest entry in the six prequels to Marvel's The Avengers. I think the movie is well cast and that it does it's job in establishing the Hulk's place in the Marvel universe (though much better than Ang Lee's attempt). Especially Edward Norton does a good job as Banner. Overall it's a movie worth owning...
B00942S4OY|5.0|This CD is gorgeous, i love it so much, i received it today and i love it so much! <3<br /><br />GET IT! I PROMISE YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!!
B009EAO38C|5.0|I ran across the Piano Guys through a friend's post to a social network last year. I've been waiting for them to release their full-length album, but was not too pleased with the original selection on their &#34;best of YouTube&#34; album. This one, however, has all of the tracks that I've really enjoyed from them. Creativity and fun the whole way through.<br /><br />One note, though, for those who listen to &#34;Cello Wars&#34; and have not seen the video to it on YouTube, be sure to go and watch the video. The sound effects will actually make more sense then.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I'm a collector, so when I learned of the 4-disc Blu-ray set for Prometheus, I had to have it.  Being a tremendous fan of the Alien Quadrilogy box set, I went into this package with high hopes.  It delivered. :)<br /><br />There are hours upon hours of documentaries, artwork, deleted scenes, etc.  The deleted scenes alone are truly special.  They really help flesh out more details of the story.  I think I actually preferred the alternate Fifield attack sequence shown on the Blu-ray to the actual theatrical cut.<br /><br />This Blu-ray teased &#34;Questions Will Be Answered&#34; in its marketing campaign, and yes, the are.  I have no complaints at all about this set.  If you enjoyed the Alien Quadrilogy, you will get that same experience here: fantastic picture, deleted scenes, and more hours of documentaries and behind the scenes footage than you'll know what to do with!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!  I loved the characters, the story, the way the plot kept me turning the page to see was going to happen next.<br />I can't think of a thing I didn't like about it.  The ending definitely leaves you hanging, wishing you had the 2nd book on hand to start reading immediately.  I will be downloading it tomorrow at the latest!
B0041KVWI4|5.0|To say the 2012 vinyl remasters have caused much controversy would be quite the understatement!  With all of internet Beatles experts expressing mostly negative things to say, I, as a \\"normal\\" non-audiophile music fan, bought a copy of Magical Mystery Tour.  My stereo consists of: VTA SP8 preamp (Telefunken, Mullard and RCA NOS tubes), a VTA-ST70 (Tele and RCA preamp, EH 6CA7 output tubes), and a Thorens TD145 with a Grado Red and several mods all into Klipsch Chorus II speakers.  Not the highest end equipment out there, but definitely great sounding stuff.<br /><br />I have mostly purple capital versions of Beatles albums from the late 70s, and an original US pressing of Magical Mystery Tour that was in pretty rough shape.  I was hoping to be able to buy flat, low noise, good sounding vinyl at a reasonable price.  I had to buy multiple copies of my other beatles albums to find ones that were clean and low noise, and am basically only 95% satisfied with my purple SPLHCB (it doesn't have the lock groove) and down from there for the rest.<br /><br />When I put Magical Mystery Tour on my turntable and dropped the needle, I was greeted with silence.  Soon enough, the title track began playing...<br /><br />The bass sounds awesome, and the high end is right where I want it, maybe a little subdued until you crank it up.  This album (and I think I can assume all of them are like this) likes to be turned up loud.  I find with my older Beatles stuff, they tend to get harsh at high volumes, where with these the louder it is, the better it sounds.  Another thing that sticks out is how each part of the mixes seem to fly at you.  I was able to focus on individual instruments and sounds that I have not been able to in the past, which makes this a fun record to listen to.  I doubt anyone who will buy this will be thinking \\"Beatles, I haven't heard of them before.  I wonder if this is any good...\\", instead I would imagine that most of us have listened to these 1000's of times.  I know in my 26 years of life, I have heard this album enough to never really NEED to hear it again.  Over the last week, I have actively sought out Magical Mystery Tour to give it a spin multiple times, and have sat enraptured on my couch.<br /><br />Maybe these don't sound like tube mastered, UK 1st pressings or whatever, but for $25 bucks, I have a clean, flat, great sounding copy of MMT that I have and will enjoy to listen to for probably decades to come.

B0042JIL24|5.0|As a big fan of Pearl Jam, this is was an record that I had not in my collection.<br />What I can say about it? This is an wonderfull box that everyone who likes the band must have in their personal collections.<br /><br />The lp's are great, the sound is perfect. And the memorabilia like the photographs and posters are awesome.<br /><br />I think that this is the most beautiful thing that I have in my collection, not only my Pearl Jam's collection, but my music collection at all.
B008V1IR4Q|5.0|Any serious student of the piano should own this box. I'm not serious, but I'll keep it anyway.<br /><br />It doesn't claim absolute completeness, but comes pretty close. For $100 you get 40 CDs + an 80 page booklet.<br />Alfred Cortot had an unbalanced recorded repertoire.<br />He was a Chopin specialist: Half his solo piano recordings are of music by Chopin.<br />His only rival was Arthur Rubinstein, but their repertoire was different:<br /><br />Rubinstein left us with 3 complete sets each of the Mazurkas, Nocturnes, Polonaises and Scherzi.<br />He avoided the Preludes (aside from once in 1946), and Etudes.<br />Cortot left us with 4 complete sets of the Preludes, and 2 sets of Etudes (all in this box).<br />He avoided the Mazurkas, Nocturnes, Polonaises and Scherzi (aside from a few pieces).<br /><br />Perhaps the division of labor was EMI's idea, but I can't imagine that their marketing department was happy with 4 sets of Preludes from the same artist.<br /><br />This box also includes 2 sets of Ballades, 2 sets of Waltzes, 1 set of Impromptus, 4 recordings of Sonata 2, and 2 recordings of Sonata 3.<br />I am frankly overwhelmed trying to comprehend it all.<br />Anything worth doing is worth doing three times. I can sympathize (I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).<br /><br />CDs 1-28 are arranged in chronological order by recording date. CDs 29-40 are arranged by genre.<br /><br />CDs 1-3: Acoustic recordings, 1916-1925. Most of these are American Victors.<br /><br />CDs 4-28: Electrical recordings, 1926-1957.<br />It begins with the 1926 recording of Chopin's Preludes. It ends with a 1957 recording of the same (previously unpublished).<br />You also get the 1933 and 1942 recordings. Amazing.<br /><br />CDs 29-34: Chamber Music with Thibaud (Franck Sonata twice), Casals, and some lesser-known colleagues + Brahms Double Concerto.<br /><br />CDs 35-36: Cortot Conducts - primarily Bach's Brandenburg Concerti.<br /><br />CD 37: Songs with Charles Panzera (Schumann) and Maggie Teyte (Debussy). No texts or translations (sigh).<br /><br />CDs 38-40: Master Class in Beethoven Sonatas, recorded 1958-1959 at L'Ecole Normale de Musique. In French (no translation) with musical examples.<br />Does not duplicate the material already issued in a Sony 3 CD set (!)<br /><br />The booklet includes a 4 page article about Cortot in French and English + 21 pages of photographs + a listing of CD contents.<br /><br />RECORDING QUALITY: Remastering by \\"Studio Art et Son, Paris, 2012\\".<br />All 40 CDs are mono, even CDs 28 and 38-40 which were recorded 1957-1960, well into the stereo era.<br />The electrical recordings are pretty good.<br />I was shocked by the sound of the acoustic recordings, 1919-1925, on CDs 1-3.<br /><br />In my experience, acoustic piano recordings sound like a toy piano: all mid-range, no highs or lows.<br />These are much better than that.<br />I have heard of computer software that can synthesize an octave of highs and lows based on the information in the original acoustic recording.<br />I don't know if that was done here, but these sound like early electricals.<br />Or perhaps credit goes to The Victor Talking Machine Company of Camden, New Jersey.<br /><br />The improved sound highlights the seediness of the orchestra in the Schumann Concerto. Probably unavoidable with 25 musicians crammed into a tiny acoustic recording studio.<br />Spirited performance nonetheless.<br /><br />WHY MY ENTHUSIASM IS MUTED:<br /><br />There is no index to the music in this collection.<br />A jumble of composers spread over 40 CDs. Too much information. No context.<br />The CDs come in plain paper sleeves. No hint as to the contents.<br />All CD labels read: \\"Alfred Cortot: Anniversary Edition\\".<br />No other details (keep the booklet handy).<br /><br />Aargh! ... Buy it anyway.<br /><br />P.S. Six weeks have passed, and I've finally finished listening to everything.<br />A rewarding experience, but exhausting.<br />I'm glad I gave it five stars, but wish it was more user-friendly.<br />Still five stars.ive stars, but wish it was more user-friendly.<br />Still five stars.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I think this is a very touching book that may have an impact on your life. I read this a bit ago, at the start of 6th grade. And it was my favorite one. It made me cry. Poor Hannah and Clay! Suicde is a very real manner. Watch out for it; you vould save someones life!

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Whats there not to like when its free and customizable.... I mainly used it for the ambience sounds so far when Im sleeping but am going to trying the brain waves soon as well.
1594484805|4.0|Love this book! I use it all the time in my work and recommend it highly. If you have any interest in human capital management you should pick it up!
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Picked this album up because I was learning a few songs for dueling pianos. I ended up really loving the entire album. Its beautiful and deceptive in its simplicity. In an age of over produced and overwritten and over covered music, this was a breath of fresh air. Organic.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book has very little going for it. I bought it as most people probably did because I enjoyed the Harry Potter series. The story line is boring and the sexuality is offensive. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|such a good game must buy the full version needs more than a five star review I love this game worth every penny spent and cant wait for number two
1451638450|5.0|If you're a fan of Lois already you want to get this book. Yes it is way better than Cryoburn. This book is mostly romance so it is more like Shards of Honor and A Civil Campaign than some of the other books. Miles only makes a brief appearance in this book. The only bad part of the book is the middle when other characters are introduced. The book kinda drags for a bit but then picks up again and has a satisfying ending.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|My review is under review as I have not finished the story yet. So far it's amazing and intricate and filled with rich detail.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I probably would have never picked up this book since I usually don't stray far from my genre but its time to move out of the comfort zone thanks to this new book club.<br /><br />In the beginning I was skeptical. There were lots of flashbacks and was a bit slow but the story line took off and was completely amazing!<br /><br />It'd so life affirming. The realization to be grateful for what you have and to make every day precious.<br /><br />I love the short chapters, the engaging characters, and the in your face moral of the story. It really does make you sit back and reevaluate where you have come from, where you are going, and where you want to go.<br /><br />This is a must read. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Reading this after all the hype I have to say that I was quite disappointed! Nothing particularly special about it
B005USZML4|5.0|Excellent series of books by my favorite author.  Hope he continues to write.  Great read and keeps you captivated. Highly recommended
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the sound selection and how I can mix together the different sounds. This always helps me sleep when I cant relax.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the book. I would have liked to know more about how things ended with some of the other characters which are left a bit open ended, but for the most part I thought it was very good, and I look forward to reading it from Christian's perspective!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is a classic with EVERYTHING for the spirit of Christmas. My family Loves it!! It is and will always be a Christmas movie for us to watch yearly.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i like it but if they would make an update so we could make buckets and minecarts i would love it
B000FBFN0Q|1.0|I was thinking I was going to love this book, and be able to completely relate to it because I am a shopaholic myself. Some of the things the main character does are just completely irritating and morally wrong. I tried really hard to like the book because I liked the movie, and usually it is the other way around with me. I read a little less than halfway through and decided to stop because I couldn't take Becky Bloomwood any longer.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|But at times this game becomes frustrating due to the difficulty level.  That takes some of the fun out of it.  They do offer some clues and helps....but in some parts of the game  is is not easy to figure out to use the clues.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy.<br />Ken Follett has not disappointed his readers with Book Two.  It took a little while to remember the characters from Book One, but as the story continues, it is easy.  It also is a great history lesson for those of us to young to remember.
B00913DPW2|3.0|it is difficult and because of that it becomes boring at times.  If they offered better clues and made this a little less difficult it would be great.  The colors are neat and the graphich are very realistic.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|its a fun game its kool that you can fight with other monsters and pet them... its a real fun game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun just like the coin machines that used to be in the arcades, at the fairs and festivals and at the local carnivals.  Really fun with great graphics and realistic sounds too.  Be careful it is addicting.  You can purchase extra coins too but when I got the game it was free.  You do not have to buy anything extra to play the game however only to extend your play time.  A great game for all ages.
0316228532|2.0|While Harry Potter was a remarkable achievement - JKR has been proving throughout the whole series how much insight she has into the adolescent mind presenting her enchanted world in rich colours, smells, layers of texture... (I devoured all of them first in English, then in the excellent translation into Czech, buying them the day they were published and reading overnight,so my children could start to read them the next morning)...I could hardly wait for  Ms. Rowling´s next book to come out, it didn´t matter if it was for children or adults...<br />And then it was here and I was barely able to put the book down, it read so well. But, throughout the book, a strange feeling started to creep on me of doing something improper, like looking through a keyhole into bedrooms, peeking inside windows to overhear a family row, poking under covers that are best left untouched - like when you watch a reality show on TV. Or some such thing that makes you feel a bit dirty.<br />The problem is in my opinion that too much was said. There is no room left for enchantment, mystery, the strange connection that is created between the author and the reader by leaving unsaid what must be left unsaid. The art so well mastered by my beloved Colm Toibin and many others as well. As if the author underestimated the reader´s capacity to feel, to judge, to comprehend... That is a pity.<br />Let me make one thing clear: as soon as JKR publishes her next book, I´ll be there, lining up to get it the first minute. She proved herself with the HP series and one book which (in my opinion) is not so good is not going to change anything in my respect for her as an author.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is a free roamed and it is great so far, this missions are fun and the story line is good. I am a major spider man fan so of course I would love this!!!

B0085RQLXK|3.0|It's good to hear some 70's style Aerosmith.  This album is definitely better than the horrific 'Just Push Play' and is a tad better than 'Nine Lives'.  The production on this album is weird, the rockers have poor production and the ballads sound very well produced.  Aerosmith almost always does good ballads, the problem is they cram 4 or 5 of them onto what is supposed to be a 'rock' album (which is what they have done with this album).  This album is a solid effort.  I'm glad someone was good enough to post the entire album on youtube so this way I didn't have to buy the album.  It would not have been worth my money for what is basically a mixed-bag album (yet again!! Aerosmith hasn't put out a solid front-to-back album since Pump...since '89? wow).<br /><br />Seeing as how this album took 11 years to create, it is highly unlikely Aerosmith will put out another since Aerosmith isn't so much a band anymore, but rather, five separate guys collecting a paycheck. Rock n' roll.
0316228532|2.0|Very disappointing and difficult to read.  Did not like it at all.  Sorry I spent the money to get it.

1451695195|5.0|I loved the book and read every line of Dr. Alexandar's account of heaven repeatedly.  This struck a chord very deep within.  A must recommend for all individuals across all religion, caste and creed, as we did indeed forgot who we are.  The world would be such a beautiful place when human beings would be able to unlock their hidden spiritual treasure and act from their deep spiritual knowledge.  A wonderful book, much kudos to Dr. Alexandar.

I hope Amazon reads this and cans this seller.  SO irritated.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Let me begin by saying this movie had some very big cinimatic shoes to fill after following The Dark Knight. Unfortunately, The Dark Knight Rises isn't worthy to even polish the shoes of its predecessor. Be aware, this review contains spoliers.<br /><br />So, TDKR takes place 8 years after the conclusion of TDK, and apparently Bruce Wayne/Batman has become one of the wimpiest crime fighters in the DC universe. First of all, the Batman that all the fans throughout the history of the mythos know that Batman never quits, ever. Yet, because Harvey Dent died, his wanna-be girlfriend died, and Batman needs to be viewed as the bad guy to preserve Harvey's image, he quits. I was actually expecting that Batman would still be at work fighting crime from within the shadows and avoiding being caught by a police force that had been turned against him. Nope, Batman just wussed out like a child and quit. We as the audience are made to believe that the events of TDK and the \\"Harvey Dent Law\\", which incidently is never actually explained, have brought about a new age of peace and prosperity in Gotham. Now, I actually have no problem with this concept. It's actually nice to hear that the work Harvey Dent, James Gordon, and Batman paid off and that things are going right in Gotham. The problem I have is that instead of taking this positive turn of events and utilizing it to do great things with his company, Bruce Wayne pretty much dumps everything he has into an energy product that he's so sure will be weaponized he has placed it under the Gotham river with a flooding emergency protocol. This pretty much sets the tone for the whole movie, not about the dangers the people and the city faces, but the fact that this is such a wide and horrible departure from the Batman mythos that I honestly don't see how the film company can call this a Batman movie with a straight face. As many others have said, Batman himself (not Bruce Wayne) is only in the movie for maybe 25 minutes. You can't makean \\"epic\\" about a superhero and not have said superhero being in the majority of the film. There are also huge plot holes and completely unexplained events that seem to just been thrown in just for dramatic effect without a care about whether or not they actually belonged in the plot or story.<br /><br />Let's start with the \\"star\\" himself, Batman/Bruce Wayne. First of all, why is this man suddenly a cripple when in the previous two movies there was no indication of such severe injury? He supposedly retired immediately after the closing of TDK, so how did he become so injured the man could barely walk? Next, let's examine the fact that Batman as presented by Christopher Nolon in no way seemed to ever represent Batman in all of the wide and varied mythos of the culture. I will freely admit that I was never a fan of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, particularly Batman, and it's possible that his ability to embrace the character had something to do with this, particularly his choice of voice when in the Batman persona. Whatever the reasons, from Batman Begins all the way through The Dark Knight Rises, not once did I see more than the barest glimpse of what Batman truly is. In every version of him, save for Christopher Nolan's series, Batman has been presented as someone who is highly intelligent, physically superior, and a very skilled investigator. Indeed, Batman himself in all other forms of media is said to possess genius-level intelligence, is a master of subterfuge/espionage, is a master of multiple fighting styles, and has an investigative skill-set that would leave all three CSI shows choking on dust even if they all joined forces. Not once did I see this in any of Nolan's movies. Oh sure, he did a tiny bit of ballistics in TDK, but that was it. His fighting in Nolan's movies was utterly pathetic. Batman is supposed to be an extremely strong and acrobatic fighter who has mastered numerous martial arts, yet all he seems to really do in Nolan's movies is boxwith an occasional kick thrown in. I can appreciate that the man is wearing armor, but make some adjustments to it to allow for a more fluid fighting style. From the scenes in the beginning of Batman Begins, it's clear that Bale has the physicallity for martial arts, but never presents that when wearing the costume. He was also never presented as utilizing his various tools during combat. Batman's fighting style often incorperated use of various weapons such as the batarang, smoke pellets, caltrops, grapple lines, etc., yet we never see that really in any movie. There's a great deal more, but I'll move on to other aspects of this movie.<br /><br />There is a great deal of problems with this movie other than Batman himself, so I'll try to limit my comments to the really bad ones. First of all, let's look at the idiocy of those in positions of authority with the GPD. In what alternate universe would any police commander or commissioner think that it's a good idea to send practically every single police officer into the sewers to look for a bad guy? This decision had me practically shedding tears for Gary Oldman. In the first two movies, he gave the character of James Gordon a strong, intelligent persona with a good head on his shoulders and a damn fine police officer/comissioner. Whoever the writer for TDKR were, they and Nolan took that image and flushed it down the toilet to be replaced by some completely clueless character that seemed to have absolutely no clue what it mean to run a police force. Second of all, with the demise of Bruce Wayne via the theft of his fingerprints and the subsequent use of them to tank his company via the stock exchange that, gasp, Bane just coincidently exploded into that very day. And we as the audience are expected to believe that such events wouldn't just flat out shut the stock exchange down and such a shocking use of the exchange wouldn't be investigated? Oh yes, and let's not forget that the event that perpetrated this outrageousevent, the theft of the fingerprints by Selina Kyle, was essentially ignored despite the fact that Bruce Wayne knew that his prints had been stolen. Batman is the kind of character that he has backups for backups and backups for those backups and so on. TDKR truly dumbed him down. Now let's examine the whole blowing up of the city by Bane. So, Bane sets off a series of massive explosions in the city, destroys all by one access out of the city, and declares that Gotham should be taken back by the people. So we are supposed to believe that regular people would, in a matter of moments, suddenly become violent outlaws that turn against the rich. People here have remarked on hiw this was clearly an omage to Occupy Wall Street and I can't disagree with that. What bothers me is that Nolan decided that an entire city population would happily do as Bane suggested, even after the man just BLEW UP THEIR CITY! Yes, this makes perfect sense to me, what sane person wouldn't eagerly follow advice of anarchy from a madman who just blew up their home without a care about the thousands of people he just killed.<br /><br />On a side note, people have been blasting the movie for the 5-6 month length of time when the bomb degraded and Batman was in that prison. Honestly, I see what the movie people were trying to do with this part of the story. The concept was that Bruce Wayne would be stuck in that prison and that he would be helpless to do anything other than watch his city fall into decline and anarchy on the television before the nuke finally wiped the entire city from the map. It was supposed to be torture for Bruce, seeing his city and home fall into such a state of hell before being destroyed and knowing there was absolutely nothing he could do to prevent it.<br /><br />Let's skip ahead to one of the worst endings for Batman ever. Once again, we're supposed to believe that his commitment to being Batman was so weak that he was perfectly happy faking his own death and moving to Europe to live happily every after with Selina Kyle while bequeathing his batcave to some rookie cop with a stupid Robin tie-in to take up the mantle? All this does is cheapen Bruce Wayne/Batman's commitment to protect his city and its people. In the end, with this movie, it seems like he doesn't even care anymore. You think after all of the insanity that the city just went through there wouldn't be a need for Batman in rebuilding it?<br /><br />Like I said, there is a tremendous amount of things that went horribly wrong with this movie, and many people have already discussed them, so I'll leave them be. I will conclude by saying, as a great fan of Batman in various media forms, I thought this movie was utterly horrible and quite frankly a grevious insult to the Batman mythos that can never be forgiven.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Wow! What an imagination this author has. Just when you think you have figured out, curve ball!! Awesome book, very entertaining.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Heavy on the drama and less action this season...so far.  If all H#!! breaks loose at the end of the season I'll give it 5 stars.
0345803485|3.0|I had to respond to \\"Meymoon\\"'s review.  It was so spot on, and hilarious.  It was just about everything I wanted to say about this book but couldn't fully express how astounded I was.  The author of \\"Fifty Shades\\" read the Twilight series and decided to cash in.  Some of the lines in this book are so close to Twilight, it is an absolute rip off.  There are so many similarities I just don't know how she got away with it.  Guess I'm just mad I didn't think of it first cause she's making bank.  It's just crazy entertainment, with crazy, crazy sex.  Wow!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I had not heard of Cloud Atlas when I heard a movie review - and was immediately drawn to book.  The writer is able to speak in many literary voices and take the reader on a journey across centuries to address some fundamental human questions - and it's a page turner.
B00932A6G4|1.0|Guess I didn't look close enough before I rented but this is simply an animated movie which is not for me.  I will say that it is quality animation but I don't really care.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|the hunger games series is the most thrilling, exiting, and the best series of books I've ever read. Simply amazing
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I am not one to buy a TV series set, especially on Blu-ray, but we just had to purchase Once Upon a Time! What a great, classic show that I hope we get to enjoy for years to come! It's refreshing for a series to be safe enough for the whole family to watch!
B009P5K4HK|5.0|i love amy winehouse--and this is a fantastic cd/dvd set to buy--im just not sure why the uk version comes with 3 dvd's and 1 cd--and this usa version only has one of each---if/when the set comes to the usa with the 3 dvd's i will be buying that also
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Really interesting book. I liked that there were two stories intertwined and that it was unlike any book I have ever read. The ending could have been a little more spectacular but over all, 5 stars.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a good book.  All John Grisham books are really good.  I really enjoyed the plot and everything.  It kept your attention all the way through.
0547884591|3.0|Expect a lot of pages, a load of information, not always relevant.<br /><br />You won't become a chef after reading this book, however you'll improve slightly your cooking skills.<br /><br />The approach is honest but the result is a little bit disappointing. The overall impression is \\"messy\\". It's in line with the series of 4-Hour book. Well documented, extensive but definitely not revolutionary.<br /><br />My personal comment to the author would be: drop the unnecessary content (language, card deck etc.) and focus on the essential. The book would definitely benefit from it.
0385535147|5.0|For me John Grisham writes best when he writes about the legal system!  As in 'The Innocent Man' Grisham is using his fictional writing as an opportunity to speak out for his legal observations, suggesting that the incarceration of far too many of American citizens in a prison-industrial complex is a substantial waste of federal and state funds. For example, the main character states early in the novel that his incarceration in prison costs Americans $40,000 per year, yet at the same time, the US spends only $8,000 annually to educate a child in their public schools.<br /> This novel has it all,exciting characters, enthralling plot twists, and page-turning action. Grisham keeps you wondering where the dish of revenge is going to be prepared and how it will be served. The plot twists and turns during the second half of the novel. Go ahead, try to stay a few steps ahead of the author!
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Got this movie for a buddy of mine that is into animation, this is ART period.. Another greay kawsaki movie (I know)..not scratch, great conditions, fast delivery, thanks guys!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Wonderful book.  Proof you can get strong and fit for the cost of a book instead of expensive equipment you don't need.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This crime story set on the Isle of Lewis is a fascinating picture of this isolated island. A policeman is sent back to the homeland he couldn't wait to leave and confronts not only a present day crime, but the past he left behind. As we flip back and forward from present to past, a whole picture slowly emerges. Well written, well plotted and engaging characters.
0525952926|4.0|I enjoyed Winter of the World quite a bit, but after reading Pillars of the Earth, World Without End, and Fall of Giants it is a bit of a dropoff in quality.  That being said, the first three books I mentioned were all &#34;can't put it down&#34; historical fiction accounts.  &#34;Winter...&#34; drags a little at times.  Here's hoping the third book of the trilogy returns to the previous excellence Follett exhibited in earlier works.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|The graphics are simple, but the gameplay is good. This reminds me of another game called &quot;munch time&quot; where timed moves can crush any hope of winning... but I like the challenge!<br /><br />However, what annoys me most is the hyped up &quot;physics&quot; of this game. That just means he repels/bounces off every surface he touches thanks to coding bounding boxes with actionscript or the like. Maybe the coding goes so far as to factor in different surface types... but is that really spectacular? Every game has physics to a certain extent and as long as your character moves, it has physics. I digress...<br /><br />Besides all that I've ranted about, the game is cute, simple and fun to play. It's perfect for children- no violence/blood or objectionable subject matter. Any age can enjoy it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|so good.  Loved the history and setting. tot  votot ot o to tot o tototo t otot otototo to t oto
B008XNZMOU|4.0|This CD is good, it has a lot of upbeat songs on it which I liked. I think its another hit for Taylor.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|not her best book.  Some of the history stuff is interesting.  The love story is getting old something needs to happen.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Spoiler Alert:  This book is a con by the main character and an author who previously treated his readers with respect.  Save your $ and borrow from the library.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game, its easy to play and has nice optiins.  would recomend to anyone.  buy app and you wont be disappointed
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I updated this app from the Play Store and it broke. After uninstalling, reinstalled and still did not work. From Amazon same.
0545425115|4.0|I did not want to like this book. I thought the idea seemed so depressing, a society keeps control over its people by forcing their children to battle it out in an arena on live TV that everyone must watch, but, in execution, the book was a fast-paced, interesting read that kept me engaged and reading with bated breath all the way to the end. It did make me ask questions about how close we are coming to their world, based on America's obsession with reality television, almost to the point we want to see people killed live on TV.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that we don't know how the civilization got to this point. I am hoping this is covered in the other two books in the series. Other than that, I recommend this book as an interesting vision of what our future might hold.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an amazing series captivating and impossible to stop watching<br />That is all i have to say really, thanks
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Originally had trouble with the program hanging up. After my review the company contacted me and I reinstalled the app and everything works great. Very good response from the company and I now enjoy the app as I expected.
B005USZML4|5.0|A very good quick read with my Grandson.  He enjoyed trying to outguess the author. A very good level book for the pre-teen, or teen.  Lots of fun to read.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|The complete book is an excellent read for the Shelock lover. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it on my Kindle Fire and I can easily carry it with me.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Atfirst it is very fun and kind of easy but as you progress it becomes much more chalinging. I have been stuck on the same level for two weeks now and can't figure out what to do.
B000JML7EC|5.0|An excellent book as expected and an interesting plot. I enjoyed the book as I expected I would and will keep it for another read in the future.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|why did they sandwich she's a rainbow between wild horses and brown sugar? why did they put streets of love from 2005 mixed with the early 80s era on disc 3? 2cd version is a good 95% chronological set and better than forty licks from 02.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first of the trilogy is the best as is often the case. I have read them all but the other two are not near as interesting as this one.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|I rented this movie twice for my daughters through Amazon.  It is a wonderful cartoon to watch.  Tinkerbell fans will not be disappointed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I enjoyed the read and learned a lot about the sniper profession. It's amazing how our soldiers continue to perform if such adverse circumstances.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed Bared to You and I did enjoy the second one Reflected in You! Great ending. Was so dissapointed to find out that the third book would be out on May 07th 2013!!! That was a bummer.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldnt put down once I picked these books up!!! I got completely lost and felt as though I was apart of Greys worlds. Perfect combo of love, thrill, suspense, while edged with darkness and sadness.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great to read this as a refresher before viewing the movie.  Reading on the Kindle is much easier than in print.
B004WMKXWM|5.0|This was the second time when I watched this movie.<br />It's awesome !!!!!!<br />I'm looking forward to part 2 sooner or later.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  I really enjoyed the entire searies.  Much easier to read it on my Kindle Fire.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|After reading a book, it was so exciting and interesting that I'd like to watch once more later.<br />I'm looking forward to watching next movie.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|It failed to meet with the hype. It was entertaining but lacked any real depth or weight that had been pitched with it's release. Essentially a 2 hour time suck.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|If you enjoyed the first book, you are likely to enjoy the second. Fun easy reading for any fantasy readers.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|was hard to find the main menu for the discs on my bluray player but the picture quality was good and i am happy with the purchase

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I felt like this book had a lot of credibility.  I'm putting this right along side of  &#34;Into the Light&#34; by Dr. John Lerma as my two favorites.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I live from appointment to appointment.  This keeps me organized, it sync's with all my gmail calendars on my other devices. It would be difficult to kept things straight without it.

B001VLXNLU|5.0|When i first started the book i was not sure how it was going to end or even start, but i will say it is a good start to a book series
B008TMA1LY|2.0|Thought my daughter would enjoy playing this as she loves Hello Kitty and enjoys games that seem similar. However, after 20 minutes of play, she deleted it off the Kindle, said she didn't like it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was written by a doctor and I thought it was heavy technically with medical terms that were beyond me.
B009A9BF5G|4.0|Coldplay's first new live release since the Sidney, Australia, 2003 DVD is a welcome one, albeit a completely different type of live release. Where \\"Live 2003\\" was the entire night of an Australian show on the Rush of Blood to the Head tour, \\"Coldplay Live 2012\\" was shot at several venues and incorporates elements of a film/documentary instead, with five insightful interviews with the band members dotted throughout the \\"set list\\" as \\"intermissions\\".<br /><br />High marks for the Blu-ray, which was released in scope format and will have black bars at the top and bottom of your screen even if you're watching on a 16:9 widescreen HDTV. This IS normal, no need to try and adjust your set. Coldplay released this in the cinemas for a short engagement and that is likely the reason behind the aspect ratio choice, although I would have welcomed it being released re-cut to 16:9 for home video release given that it is a concert film and no real loss would have occurred unlike what can happen with movies or TV shows. The cover incorrectly lists the aspect ratio as 16:9, but it is actually 2.39:1. Picture quality was stable throughout and it wasn't until the credits that I noticed a strange anomaly with some blurring. Luckily it's redundant as you don't really care about this part of the Blu-ray. The entire program looks good outside of this. Some Alexa cameras were used in the Stade footage which looks particularly clean, there is obviously a mix of different cameras used which means you'll see some grain here and there from the ones being shot on film. Thankfully EMI chose not to scrub this out with over-zealous digital noise reduction which would have further reduced the high frequency detail Blu-ray is capable of resolving.<br /><br />The 5.1 dts-HD Master Audio track throughout is very capable, fidelity is great and the sound of a live venue is accurately captured through the ambience of the rear speakers. The running time of a Coldplay show is likely a little longer given that they usually take the stage at 9pm and play until 11pm. It's a shame they couldn't include a full evening's worth of songs on here as a special \\"director's cut\\".  For example, looking up the setlist for the Montreal show featured in the program shows that 21 songs were played that night. With the dual layer 50GB Blu-ray they used for this release they could have easily fit more songs on to give a full tour, or included the ones they didn't want to use in the film as extras. There are only two extra songs included in the \\"Extras\\" section, where are the rest of the songs they played on this tour? It was in the extras watching \\"The Scientist\\" (note the extra two songs don't offer 5.1 surround options) that I noticed some pixelation during the lighting which is quite busy. Perhaps they could have used some additional passes in the encoding?<br /><br />My favorite of the new Coldplay tracks from Mylo Xyloto is here, Major Minus. This song reminds me most of Coldplay around the Rush of Blood days, with a little influence from \\"The Verve\\". Coldplay are on good form here, every song is exciting to listen to but what really pushed this release to the 4-star mark for me, overcoming the lack of sheer concert footage included, were the excellent intermissions giving a candid look at the band on the road. The 1st intermission was my favorite, with Martin describing what it's like just before you go on stage and what gets him motivated and excited for every single performance. The other intermissions are also well worth watching of course, as usually you only get to hear Chris Martin predominantly in Coldplay interviews. Here each member gets their own intermission segment before a final one again with Martin. I really enjoyed hearing Guy talk as he's the one you usually hear the least from. The wristband segment was really fun to watch and looks amazing on this Blu-ray. One of the biggest flaws of this is how busy the camera shots can be during certain songs. You want to payattention to what's going on but the director decides you need to \\"feel\\" the busy parts of the song by going to quick scene shots. When you're at the concert, do you start darting your eyes from left to right about the stage, panning around to quickly look at the audience, back to Guy, quickly to Will, Chris, back to audience? If not then why would people include this as a style? It's bad enough in the movies, it should be intolerable in a concert release. Coldplay are not The Prodigy. Fortunately there are songs in here that don't suffer as badly. I though God Put A Smile was one of the worst. Also, you can shut the picture off and just enjoy the 24-bit/48kHz dts-HD Master Audio surround mix with your eyes closed, luckily they don't pan the surround mix like they do the picture, as you would in a movie. Wouldn't that make you vomit?<br /><br />The CD's unfortunately don't fare well with audio quality like the Blu-ray did. The Blu-ray is thankfully free of egregious dynamic range compression, otherwise known as the \\"loudness wars\\". You can enjoy this dynamic performance in your home theater and turn it up. The CD's are already cranked and the dynamic range has been strongly reduced. If you can find a way to extract the 24-bit PCM stereo track from the Blu-ray and dither it to 16-bits and 44.1kHz sampling rate and burn that to CD it will sound much better than the included CD. Still, you're buying this for the Blu-ray and thus it's still a 4-star release.<br /><br />This is a good Blu-ray release, good set list, great performance and has above average audio and video. I'd recommend it to new and old fans of the band.attention to what's going on but the director decides you need to \\"feel\\" the busy parts of the song by going to quick scene shots.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I wait for the novels to come out with great anticipation and John Grisham never disappoints. Unless you read the last chapter first (I actually know people who do this)you will want to read every page to find out how the well thought out plot will unfold
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I was excited about this new book but at the end I didn't even want to finish it.  Where is the Cornwell from the beginning books?  The books starts out very exciting and then it fizzles out.  I expect technical stuff due to the nature of the doctors profession but it doesnt really take you anywhere.  I miss the old doc
B001VTTRC6|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best films of all time. It messes with your head, gets you thinking, and you come out a better person on the other side. Themes like family, trust, believing and supporting the people you love, being honest, and learning to grown past yourself are definitely centric. Incredibly well done.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Absolutely love Carrie!  Yet another great CD from her!  All of the songs are great.  Would definitely recommend to anyone that likes Carrie.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Needed a small sweeper for those quick touch-ups.<br />This unit fits the bill.  The battery last for 6 uses at about 10 minutes each.<br />I really like how it swivels in any direction and its easy to empty.<br />Use caution with the handle.  Don't press/push too hard.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Enjoyed this book a great deal.  It constantly kept me wondering what I was missing to the story.  Nice insight on a teenage mind.  Showed both the good and dark side to this age group.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|My first book on a kindle and thoroughly enjoyed. I don't go for this thriller type genre but glad I did. It reminded me of film I had watched years ago with guy Pearce in apologies I don't recall the film title! This book did linger with me during the day and I almost felt anxious for Christine the main character when reading as the writing was so good.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Picture quality was very low over streaming as well..not that it would makup for the picture itself having no real story line and made me wish there was a fast forward button.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thought it was creative and well thought out.  It absolutely kept my attention throughout  the entire book.  I thought that this book was very different than any of his previous books.
B00913DPW2|4.0|This game is different than regular find items in a room type game. This one has riddles to solve and puzzles to find.A great time waster game that sucks you in. 4 stars from me!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best series to come out in a long time. Amc has been putting together some great shows lately and this is another.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Interesting story with nuggets of canine \\"wisdom\\".  Wish I had written down some of them! Fairly predictable but satisfying. Makes one wonder what my dog would write..
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After hearing all the hype about these books, I finally broke down and bought them.  I enjoyed the story, though the main female character was a bit irritating.  It was an good read, if you can ignore the hype.  It definitely wasn't the best book I ever read, and just because the book is about bondage that doesn't mean this book is something new.
1936608618|5.0|I ran across Brian Mackenzie's material several months ago while recovering from a running injury and his methods made a lot of since to me.  I've incorporated them in my training and Brian's methods have made a huge difference in my performance.  I anticipated a good book from Brain but was totally blown away by the detail of the content as well as the expertise he pulled in to create, in my opinion, the best resource of its type on the market today.  I highly recommend it and I give it an enthusiastic 5 stars!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  The author pulls one into the story very early on in the first book.  One of those books you just have to read until the very last few words!

B009E3EY38|5.0|So here it is at last on general sale: the 2xCD+Blu-Ray+DVD package of Zeppelin's now-legendary one-off celebratory reunion performance on 10th December 2007 at London's O2 Arena. The event was to honour the life and work of Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun who in 1968 had such faith in a young British band that he backed them with money and a recording contract, and who died aged 83 of a backstage fall during the Rolling Stones benefit concert in October 2006.<br /><br />Is all the hype about this concert justified? You bet. The performance is indeed worthy of all the superlatives heaped on it, and in every way outstanding.<br /><br />Having seen the youthful band several times in the 1970s, the initial shock of seeing three guys in their 60s (well OK, in 2007 Plant was 59) - plus the near-perfect-fit Jason Bonham standing in for his long-departed father on drums - on stage together, is swept away once the music starts. From the storming opener `Good Times Bad Times' through two hours of some of their best-known numbers, this is Led Zeppelin, and this band ROCKS. The fast-fingered Page is outstanding; Plant - ever the great showman and commanding stage presence - retains power, emotion, volume and range in his voice even though he avoids the screaming high notes which gave Zeppelin distinctive character in their youth; JPJ is the bedrock for the band both on keyboards and bass, and Jason Bonham almost unbelievably gels with the band so perfectly that he might indeed be his father pounding the skins with power and feel.<br /><br />Much of the time Page, Plant and Jones stand close together, physically; almost touching each other. The astounding thing is how relaxed they are, how at ease, how professional - and how they simply enjoy themselves on stage so much. The sense of occasion is intoxicating, the numbers powerful, tight, joyous. Plant relaxes and chats good-naturedly with the audience between songs, the atmosphere that of a celebratory family reunion where everyone is simply having a great time.<br /><br />Highlights: too many to list. `Kashmir' probably takes the Gold. Awesome.<br /><br />The cover shows the iconic Zeppelin over London, presented in the slightly archaic style characteristic of the artwork so often employed by the band. CD1 displays the time 10.12 on an antique clock-face, on CD2 it's 12.10: the walk-on and walk-off times of the band on the night. Nice touch.<br /><br />If you can stretch to it, buy the DVD or Blu-Ray in the package so you can actually see the band performing. Seeing them play and interact with each other and with the audience is a must, and adds so much to the experience. Many of the frames are close-up and personal, with a front-row audience perspective. You do, however, need to hear the music through a big powerful sound system: play loud.<br /><br />Some minor points: there is no acoustic set, a standard of the band's stage shows in the 1970s, and the actual song `Celebration Day' - the perfect name for this event - is not performed. These are not niggles, just observations: the whole concert is awesome.<br /><br />For those fortunate enough to have won tickets, they have the experience of a lifetime, a night to remember. There were tales of ticketless devotees on the night offering more than GB£4,000 in cash for a ticket, and of ticket-clutching fans refusing to sell. They made the right choice. For the rest of us, this is as good as it's going to get - and fortunately, that's pretty darned good. Plant has reportedly turned down US$200 million on offer for a new world tour and ruled it out emphatically, though the other three have been more equivocal. Personally I hope this was Zep's final concert, as it's difficult to imagine they could ever top it and this way, they go out in grandeur and style.<br /><br />Once giants walked the Earth and alas, we may never see their like again. But at least we have the record, and what a record it is.re everyone is simply having a great time.<br /><br />Highlights: too many to list. `Kashmir' probably takes the Gold.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|If you're looking for a good blade that is cheap, sturdy, heavy and an all-around great value, I'd recommend you look no further than the Schrade SCHF9.<br /><br />I am a husband and father, meaning I can't afford to just toss several hundred dollars at a knife purchase.  And since my last knife was stolen, it left me feeling less than excited to spend too much on a blade.<br /><br />After reading several reviews all over the web, including on various survival/bushcraft forums & websites I realized that I'd be a fool not to buy this knife!  So, after shopping around for a good deal, I decided to order the Schrade SCHF9 from good ol' Amazon.<br /><br />Skip ahead a few days and a fairly large box arrives at the front door.  &#34;Is it my knife?  No way - that box is WAY too big,&#34; I thought.  &#34;Maybe my wife ordered something from Amazon too...&#34;<br /><br />So I did what any good husband would do and I opened what I thought was a package for my wife.<br /><br />To my surprise, inside of the huge box was a HUGE blade!<br /><br />It came in a black nylon sheath that is lined in plastic & of fairly decent quality.  The sheath also has another small pouch that attaches to the front, in case you want to carry around a firestarter, or other smaller survival items.<br /><br />But enough about the sheath...<br /><br />The blade came sharp.  Not razor sharp like most ESEEs come, but it was pretty dang sharp.  In addition to being sharp, the blade is long, thick and HEAVY.  It's also extremely easy to control while chopping at wood or batoning through a log.<br /><br />After sharpening it to a razor edge, I took it out in the field with me for a couple days and was really impressed with its &#34;real world&#34; performance.<br /><br />I split several red oak logs...logs that I also chopped up with the SCHF9.  Not only did the blade make it through several 20 inch oak logs, but the edge was still pretty sharp.  In fact, I only had to sharpen it after cutting/batoning around 30 logs!  My friends, who all have 200-300 dollar knives (ESEEs, Tom Brown Trackers, TOPS, etc) were all impressed with this blade.  In fact, since we are all fairly competetive, we had a contest to see who could work through an oak log the fastest...<br /><br />I chopped through my oak log before they did  AND had enough time to baton through it before ANY of my friends finished.  And to top it off, my blade was still totally sharp.<br /><br />The handle, though not extremely shock absorbent, was comfy & easy to grip.  I'd suggest wearing a glove for more padding.<br /><br />Anyway, if you need a good, strong, affordable knife, don't wait to pick this bad boy up.
B007W8S2MG|4.0|I have played a few persona games in the past and have always enjoyed them. This game looks and feels amazing. The gameplay is solid, storyline a mystery, and overall an amazing game.<br /><br />Only reason for 4 stars is because of no Japanese Voice-Over Option for the English release. I always find the original Japanese voice acting to be much more emotional then English dubbed voices. I also am slowly trying to learn basic Japanese and games/movies always help. Oh well<br /><br />cheers

B008XBCJ34|5.0|I am an avid 3D fan when it is done right and used to enhance the images and story line. Avatar seems to fulfill all those requirements for me. It has taken the better part of 4 years for the release of Avatar in 3D. Prior to this, Avatar was released in Blue ray, and rereleased with different packaging. Was this a marketing ploy to milk every last penny of Avatars popularity with viewers and fans? I believe so. However, that does not negate the fact that this film is nothing short of amazing in 3D. I viewed this film originally in Imax 3D and was floored! I am no less impressed with this version of the film! It's been a long time coming. If you can watch 3D for an extended period of time, then I would highly recommend experiencing this film in it's originally intended format.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Mr DeMille is again at the top of his game. There's only been two books I've ever read twice. One was The Caine Mutiny and the other was The Charm School. Mabe it's time for another trip down The Rivers of Babylon and a stop at the Cathederal after it's done. Mr. DeMilles' books are like a fine wine, something to be savoured to the last drop. Hope it's not to long  till the next one.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|\\"Greatest Hits: Chapter One\\" by Kelly Clarkson showcases many of her quality music  tunes throughout her career. It bears repeating that many Kelly Clarkson fans are going to have personalized sentiments on the songs that musically spoke to them. However, the following listing includes some of my personal favorites among the musical gems in \\"Greatest Hits\\": Chapter One\\":<br />\\"Miss Independent\\",\\"Breakaway\\", \\"Don't You Wanna Stay\\"(with Jason Aldean), \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Catch My Breath\\", \\"People Like Us\\", and \\"A Moment Like This\\".<br />\\"Greatest Hits; Chapter One\\" by Kelly Clarkson is best for those who enjoy greatest hits collections from the pop music genre and/or the music era from 2003-2011.
B000069HZP|5.0|A very suspenseful movie. It has lots of mystery and plenty of action. It will keep you guessing through the length of the film.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|I previously enjoyed \\"Planet Pit\\" by Pitbull and enjoyed the fact that the title of the cd lived up to its name.  I actually enjoy \\"Global Warming\\" by Pitbull even more and really felt that he poured so much of his imaginative energy into the musical tracks of \\"Global Warming\\". Once again, I completely understand that Pitbull's listening audience may or may not share the same ideas as me on the best tracks from \\"Global Warming\\". However, the songs that really put me in a good time mood are among the following:<br />\\"Feel This Moment\\" (featuring Christina Aguilera),\\"Back In Time\\" (featured in the Men In Black 3\\" movie), \\"Hope We Meet Again\\" (featuring Chris Brown), \\"Party Ain't Over\\" (featuring Usher and Afrojack), \\"Drinks For You (Ladies Anthem\\" (featuring Jennifer Lopez), \\"Have Some Fun\\" (featuring The Wanted & Afrojack), Tchu Tchu Tcha\\" (featuring Enrique Iglesias), \\"Last Night\\" (featuring Havana Brown & Afrojack), and \\"Everybody\\" (featuring Akon & David Rush).<br />\\"Global Warming\\" (Deluxe Edition) by Pitbull is definitely a good buy for anyone that has enjoyed any of this previous musical works and/or music that brilliantly mashes up various music genres (such as the musical mixes of R&B, dance, rap, and electronic in this collection).
B000FCK65W|4.0|The imagery in this book is haunting and evocative.  The struggle for dignity amid poverty is still poignant and relevant today.  This book is a timeless classic.  Read it for the first time, or read it again.  You will be glad that you did.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I first heard Lana Del Rey when I was in Brazil (of all places) and I immediately went back to the hotel and bought a digital copy of Born To Die. I must have listened to that album 500 times on that trip and since. Just listened to Paradise a couple times and while I don't feel it's as amazing as Born To Die is, it's close. 'American' is my favorite. Her voice is so unique and the albums are so good that I can't wait to play them for ANYONE that gets in my car!
B008MEM24S|3.0|I don't play this game but it is keeping my grandson occupied and  he seems to like it. Thanks again.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I read a lot of negative/neutral reviews about this album, but decided to purchase it anyway. I'm so glad I did! The soundtrack compliments the movie so well and I love all of the artists chosen to be part of it.
068484267X|5.0|This book is for my son's Literature class. It came right on time and he's enjoying the class discussions. Although, he would not recommend it to a male teenager for fun reading as he put it.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|only a couple funny lines, if you like chickflicks its just like every other one they are just spitting out of hollywood. mediocre storyline, not worth seeing again. the blond british chick is the best character in the whole movie
B000SEGUDE|5.0|a little difficult to follow in the beginning but once the story unfolds it has all the elements of a great read.
B009VB97EY|4.0|the acting is alright but the view isnt so bad. worth giving it a watch, not very in depth character development or anything but entertaining nonetheless.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|just bought this game for my fire hd, amazing color!!! i love this game, loads of levels it'll keep you busy for a long time!!!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This app is definitely worth the price. The puzzles are challenging but fun and the developers continue to add more. I have played this on my phone but it is so much better on my tablet. Cons would be it's difficult to select the correct square at times and I've hit the back button when I meant to hit undo. Otherwise a great game.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I found this book to be non-sensical on the whole. The moving between stories was an interesting structure and that is not what put me off. The writing was just hard to follow.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer.  Where did all these geniuses come from?<br />Convoluted.  Not up to Grisham standards, but a good read nevertheless.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awsome you shouldn't even think about getting it you should just go with your senses i know i already said this but this game is awsome
B009NPA3MS|5.0|To be brief, you won't be disappointed by this album.  If you are into good song-writing, folk/rock, etc. - you will like this album alot.  Sure, you hear some influences in there (DMB, Mumford, Damien Rice, etc.) - but he is orginal in sound and songs.  Good stuff - highly recommend.
B008458O3S|5.0|I got this during the promotion, but would easily have paid upwards of the 99&cent; requested. The game is a lot of fun if you like puzzle games that make you think, particularly if you don't necessarily equate flashiness with a great game. It is well executed, and has great tutorials that you can skip at will. If you're on the fence about purchasing, at least try the Express version.<br /><br />Caveat: it does occasionally annoy me by telling me to check another one of the company's games.  It only happens during a fresh startup of the game, and it doesn't intrude on the gameplay at all.<br /><br />For my personal likes and wants, I think it's great. Highly recommended (if you like thinking puzzles).
B0029LHWL8|5.0|The book I purchased was used and arrived in excellent condition with the signature of the previous reader which I so loved.  The story is riveting and full of fantasy or real?  It keeps the reader wondering.  I would recommend this book to all ages.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I really enjoy Bad Piggies!!! Lots of fun and works great on my Kindle Fire 1st edition. Hope they add more levels
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|His story is moving, and shows how powerful faith is with a family going through very trying times.  Individuals like this make me proud to be an American!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a fine example of a logic game. Challenging, engaging, and soothing at the same time. Thank you, author.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Reading about the courage and will power of the men is highly motivating... It's hard to imagine how anyone can go through a &#34;normal&#34; battle, let alone being shot multiple times, falling down the side of a mountain multiple times and still fighting like they did.
0307277453|5.0|I read this book in rather harrowing circumstances- sitting at my mother's bedside during the last week of her life. It's a tribute to the quality of Neil Shubin's writing that I was able to find interest and involvement in it despite the heavy weight on my mind.<br /><br />Professor Shubin gives an introductory overview of human anatomy in its evolutionary context. His starting point is his own major discovery of the fossil fish Tiktaalik (a name chosen from a submission by the Inuit people as being the one easiest to pronounce!), a transitional species between fish and amphibians which was found exactly where the theory of evolution predicted it would be found. From there he reviews different facets of human anatomy and points out how features that we think of as uniquely human are in fact derived from species that preceded us by hundreds of millions of years.<br /><br />While this is a book solidly grounded in science, it's not a book for scientists. Its length, 200 pages, is barely enough to cover a handful of topics in general terms. Those intending to study anatomy, evolution, paleontology or any related field will find the material presented here very basic. However, for those of us interested in why we are what we are, it's an excellent primer which may inspire further exploration of this most fascinating subject.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|this is a great gift to send to grandparents or loved ones too far away to read to your baby or child.  you can hear their voice and feel close.  i love these books, and this classic one in general.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|The DVD has a big section that is bad, cheap reproduction and not happy with quality of the product. It was cheap and really was..
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I purchased this watch as a daily wearer for work and I am more than satisfied with it.  The watch holds up nicely to anything I throw at it.  The watch, so far, is fairly accurate for an automatic at around +20 seconds/day.  I can definitely live with that.  I do wish I could wind it, but that's a minor thing.  My only real gripe is the jubilee bracelet - it's flimsy and cheap.  It IS comfortable but that's about all.  I swapped the bracelet out for a gray NATO strap and it looks fantastic and wears much better.  The lume is bright and lasts a long time.  The bezel turns with a nice click.  The watch is fairly tall at 14mm and it wears taller than that, but it's not absurd (it looks nice).  The day/date function is nice to have and easy to set.  It's not the dressiest watch around and I probably would not wear it with a suit, but for daily wear it's hard to beat.
B002I7IE24|4.0|I haven't watched this. My husband ordered it. He likes foreign  films. He said it was really good. It arrived promptly and was in good condition.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|This movie shows how one man beat the giants . Those looks on those kids faces are priceless.  Excellent .
B0001ARCFA|3.0|I'm bummed these were just too big for my head :(. they fit halfway down my ears. Great sound quality.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This was an amazing book. falling for the sexy bad boy is not gonna happen. I mean gasp. He's not your normal bad boy. He's a gang banger.  The blood in blood out kind. Plus you already have a boyfriend. So why can't you stay away from the sexy bad boy. Or right he's your lab partner. And that's the only reason you keep going around him. Yeah<br />... that's a lie!!! Read read read this book now!!!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Got it because of the title and enjoyed every unbelievable minute. Highly recommended to anyone who likes a good pseudo adventure story.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I am a huge Twilight fan and I love the music. I've discovered so many awesome bands/musicians through these soundtracks. I have to admit, I wasn't so sure about this last soundtrack, but glad I gave it a chance, because the songs really grow on you (you have to really listen to the lyrics). I pretty much like all the songs but I'm still not sure about the \\"Forgotten\\" by Green Day (perhaps I'll like eventually). My favorite are; fire in the water, everything and nothing, speak up, cover your tracks, new for you, ghost (they are so captivating). Yea for another Twilight soundtrack!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always look forward to the arrival of a new John Grisham book.  I pre-order most of his books so they arrive on my Kindle the very first day.  A few of his books have been somewhat disappointing, but I still remain a fan.  I enjoy it when the plot starts evolving in the first chapter and keeps running through to the very end of the book.  The Racketeer does exactly this.  The characters were wonderful and the plot was downright engrossing right up to the last page.  Thanks, Mr. Grisham.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Will most likely read it again because I read it so quickly.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This is fantastic! Just can't beat it, I wish there was a part 3! You won't regret seeing it. This review is mostly to undo a fake post.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|To many popups -- can't enjoy game. I thought I would really enjoy game, but every time you turn around there is another popup to delete.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love this book. The point of view from a neurosurgeon, who before his NDE, was such a total man of science only, is just such positive reinforcement for what I have always believed....that we are definitely more than this body and that we do go on. It is beautifully written and just marvelous and I am thankful he came back to share his experiences. If you buy it get ready because you will not be able to put it down. Even my friends whoare non-readers read and loved this book!
B008EK91XU|5.0|Ian Thorpe is a champion.  This comment is not restricted to just his swimming.  He is a champion because he cares about being a human being.  He cares about good old fashioned values.  Therefore he represents to me what Australia is all about.  Opportunites that can be taken to acheive something great.  Great read.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I bought this for Kindle, so I have yet been able to recognize the benefit or difference of this version (40th Anniversary) vs. previous versions.  As for the book itself, it had been a while since I had read it.  Again, Frank Herbert is absolutely amazing in creating the Dune universe...many levels superior to the \\"clever\\" sci-fi\\" prevalent today.  My favorite aspect of the Dune series is the contemplation of humans moving toward the Omega Moment, or in other words the process by which humans could evolve in virtual gods.  This is a topic that Herbert covered in other non-Dune books that he wrote as well.  It is a topic that is more and more discussed even by serious scientists and philosophers in light of discoveries of the epigenome among the fundamental nature of the universe.  Herbert was way ahead of his time.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A very good read, not surprising as I have enjoyed most of DeMillie's writing<br />starting with the Charm School many years ago
B008G12ERC|5.0|A great album that redeems Muse from its mediocre (for Muse) effort with The Resistance.  This time Bellamy treats love and relationships in a much more mature, less sappy way in tracks like Madness.  Meanwhile, they give us victorious music such as survival that builds and builds until it reaches a wonderful crescendo.  No weak tracks on this one.  I highly recommend.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is so gripping, one minute your in complete disgust, the next minute your bawling your eyes out! This is a must see! The actors are all phenomenal, the writing is absolutely crazy, the best!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|As a Kiss fan since 1976 I bought Sonic Boom when it came out a few years ago but I did not listen to it much until I heard Kiss was putting out a new album called Monster. I decided to give SB another listen and I was quite impressed by the catchy songwriting and Tommy's near perfect imitation of Ace (wide vibrato, unison bends, similar pentatonic licks, etc.).  So I decided to get Monster as well. This album is just as good as Sonic Boom and both albums have some of the best music they have put out since the early 1980s.  There are no ballads or filler material, just good fun solid hard rock! Gene and Paul sound as good as ever. My only \\"beef\\" with Monster and SB is the fact that Gene and Paul often downplay Ace and Peter's contribution to Kiss yet they clearly told Tommy to play like Ace, and even Eric sings a bit like Peter (coincidence?). Normally I don't like artists who do not attempt to have some degree of originality but I must say that Tommy nails Ace perfectly and on Monster he branches out more. For all of you who want Kiss to go back in time and put out another Destroyer, it isn't going to happen because this is 2012 and it's not the same band. So open your mind and give it a chance. It's not quite as classic as some of their albums from the 1970s but it comes darn close. All in all good R&R from a band that still has it!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|We loved this movie.  Such a great message and fun for the kids.  I recommend watching it over and over.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I got it, toyed around with it for about 20 minutes, couldn't figure it out, exceeded my attention span, and deleted it.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I've read all of DeMille's books.  The Panther is better than some but not his best, for me that would probably be Word of Honor.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Trailers for Magic Mike made it seem like a comedy...in reality, not so much.  Therefore I was disappointed in the serious turn it took.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Great game, if you like puzzle/logic games. I have spent way to many hours playing this game, CrossMe Color is my go to game.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|WOW. Chris Anderson, thank you for showing us the magic behind the curtain. Loved it!<br /><br />This timely book chronicled the progress of creative ideas from 'back in the day' to the future for bringing ideas to market quickly and affordably for personal enjoyment and ideas for living that are changing the world. This book presents a new global solution for solving problems, funding, and manufacturing everything from widgets to visions only Star Trek dared to dream.<br /><br />Thanks and good luck in your new venture; now go build us a ROBOT that folds laundry. - Phyllis Davis, Co-Inventor, Portable Farms Aquaponics Systems
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I was looking forward to this album and was not disappointed.  What a magnificent voice and what a wonderful gift to all.  I will play this often and thank God for the gift he has given Susan and for her so lovingly sharing it with us.  Buy this CD -  you will cherish it for years to come.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|GRISHAM IS BACK TO WRITING ABOUT CONSEQUENSES THAT THE READER HAS NO IDEA AS TO THE OUTCOME, MUCH AS HIS SUCESS WITH THE &#34;FIRM&#34; THIS BOOK REALLY CAPTURES YOUR ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY THE SECOND HALF.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Was too hard to figure out what needed to be done.  Should be more intuative.<br />Not particularly entertaining.  Cannot recommend.
B000QRIGJY|4.0|THE &#34;HARRY BOSCH&#34; BOOKS ALWAYS SEEM TO PLEASE ME. HE IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF A HARD NOSED DETECTIVE. NOTHING EVER GOES RIGHT FOR HARRY BUT THROUGH PERSERVERENCE AND JUST PLAIN GOOD DETECTIVE WORK HE SUCEEDS.<br />WILL ALWAYS TAKE A CHANCE WITH A HARRY BOSCH NOVEL
B007HU7NBK|4.0|I'm glad I read the book and I do feel I know more about John Taylor than I did before but this was a very quick glance about his life.<br />I feel there is more to John Taylor than this book tells.  It's a very good retrospective but hardly the full serving.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Several family members really like this game. Keeps your mind sharp. Great puzzle game. Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great overall story and acting.  Top notch special effects. Looking forward to more.  &#34;Puny god&#34; - Hulk  (still laughing at that one)
1869505301|3.0|The history of making &#34;Lords of Te Ring&#34; and the making of movie was wall written. Yet, it is a paper book. It can be upgraded to a much lively interactive version. For instance, by using the  current well-preserved &#34;Hobbit&#34; village, more can be written with the emphasis of the climate, scenery and people of NZ. They are the people from Middle Earth!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Shows exactly how much battery percentage left and can clearly see if its being charged. Very good app for kindle fire HD, i would recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I thought the first part was interesting but the thing about the movie and the gold bars was hard to follow the time line.
B002BWCJOA|4.0|Older children, 10 and 12, love the story. Although the old ladies are rather gross and immodest, the rest is enjoyable. Good visuals, can be a little frightening to young kids.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Just got the new CD and DVD. Wow! These guys still have it! Really enjoyed it! Worth the wait! So sublime!
038533348X|3.0|I've read a couple of Vonnegut books before and I really enjoyed them.  To say Vonnegut is quirky might either be a compliment or not taking it far enough.  First off, this is a quick read.  Also, it's a fun read.  The characters are unique and even the main character is likable and that's sometimes hard to portray in 1st person writing styles.  When I looked online to see the synopsis of what the book was about, every description tells you more about Vonnegut and what he's alluding to rather than what the book is actually about.  That's because this book is kind of hard to describe.  There is a main story here for sure.  However, the hardest part of reading this book is actually to understand what to get out of it.  I think there's some commentary on religion and the Cold War (literally in this book).  But, with reading Vonnegut's other books that I have, I knew what he wanted me to take away from it.  Here, that's a little harder.  I'm sure that undercuts me as a reader rather than Vonnegut as an author.  Still, I had fun reading it and it would be interesting to see what other people took away from it.  Final Grade - C+
B0030B624E|5.0|My whole family loved this movie... We talk about it all the time, especially with the closing of Hostess. We never thought we would be faced with actually losing Twinkies... Great fun!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fun way to use pinterest when I'm away from my computer.  Easy to use, but can crash or error out sometimes.
0142407909|5.0|Just what I needed, with scenery and set suggestions in the back of the book. It came in great timing too!
1451696191|4.0|Years and years ago, while combing a book store in Pittsburgh, I added The Perks of Being a Wallflower to my list of books to read.  Five or six year later, upon hearing it had been turned into a movie, I decided to finally get around to it. (As a habit, I always read the books before the movies, if I can help it, so this book jumped to the top of my list).<br /><br />I thought it was great. Not the greatest book I've ever read, and not one that I'd necessarily read again, but for what it was, it was great. I really felt Charlie's pain, and like I got to know who he was and feel what he was going through first hand. I suppose that was the point. You aren't really an \\"observer\\" in this book, you are a \\"participant.\\" And if I'm the author and that's what I was driving at, mission accomplished.<br /><br />The story being told through anonymous letters was the right choice to me. It could have been done differently, but I'm not sure it would have been as effective. You were in it with Charlie. He told you his deepest, darkest secrets, the ones he knew, and the ones you discovered along with him. Very effective. And very entertaining. I feel for him, feel sad for him, want the best for him. If I went to school with him, I would have liked him, and I would have befriended him as Sam and Patrick did.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star is because, unlike The Catcher in the Rye or Prep, I don't see myself reading this book more than once. It was great, and I'm really glad I read it, but it doesn't hold enough storyline to have me read it again. The message is the most important, and I got that the first time around, so again, mission accomplished.<br /><br />It's an easy read, very easy, so I'd encourage others to see what they take from it. It's a very sweet, sad, touching tale. I was sad to see it end; and I enjoyed the range of emotions I got from reading it. A little bittersweet, for sure.<br /><br />Now, time to see what they did with the movie.
B009GX6600|5.0|This is my favorite TV show.  It's wonderful to be able to watch  episodes whenever I want-- on my Kindle anywhere.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is another excellent book by John Grisham!  I didn't want to put the book down, great plot with a twist. I recommend it to anyone who likes these types of story lines!!!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|The best ever film i ever watched, I've watched it like hundred times and counting!...Keira is amazing in this movie, every characters are wonderfully<br />acted! I will recommend this to anybody!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I am a Ken Follett fan, but compared to Pillars of the Earth or Fall of Giants, Winter of the World was not up to those standards. I thought that it concentrated too much on the events in the lives of the fictional families and not enough on the historical context in which they were placed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app works perfectly. Thank you for the free calculator. I use it for my weekly budgeting and bill paying.
0670023329|4.0|Blaine Harden interviewed Shin Dong-hyuk, born in 1983 inside Camp 14, one of five largest and most cruelsome political prisons in the mountains of North Korea. Luck was on his side when Shin managed to escape the camp, survive in North Korea, cross the Chinese border, survive on the other side and eventually migrate to South Korea and the USA. Where Shin's earlier memoir flopped, this version, enriched with maps, drawings, history and interview output from others definitely got the attention of many readers around the globe. Camp 14, though visible on Google Earth, and yet unreachable from the outside world. It is located about 55 miles north of Pyongyang. Shin's story is cruel and reminds some readers of the Nazi concentration camps in World War II, or the Siberian Gulagh camps in the USSR era. A complete control camp, suicide an serious option for those that can't stand the physical and psychological pressures from long working days, endless punishments and other ways to repent from sins against the Kim Jong Il dynasty.<br />No other born in a North Korean political prison camp ever has escaped and survived before Shin. And while his escape may be filled with luck with other relatives and a fellow that would travel with him dead, Shin's story is unique. Blaiden's additions also share insights from the difficulties to socialize, get customed to the western world, trust people and build professional and private relationships.<br />Warning:  Escape from Camp 14 exposes the cruelty underpinning the North Korean regime and won't leave you innocent.
B0001ADB8C|5.0|It is exactly what I was waiting for. I was very happy to discover this box and expecially the DVD.<br />Delivery was on time and service has been very good . Thank you very much.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|WINTER OF THE WORLD: THE EMAIL BOOK SHOULD HAVE AN INTRO LIKE THE HARD COVER. IT OUTLINED THE LIST OF CHARACTERS AND WHO THEY WERE.  FOUND THAT THE BOOK JUMPS TOO OFTEN FROM EACH CHARACTER.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|&#34;The Panther&#34; once we get past the anti-Yemeni rhetoric has a pretty good story. However, I almost put this book down for good about 3 times. Between John Corey's over the top &#34;wise ass&#34; comments and the arabaphobic tenor of the story it was difficult at times not to throw the book through  a window. The base story is very good with excellent commentaries in some areas, it is this and the fact I was reading it  on a Kindle that kept me from throwing it in the trash bin. I guess having been involved in that part of the world I disliked John Corey and his anti Arab attitude as a character. Every once in a while Mr. Demille toned him down to a level that the story could continue. When that I happened I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;The Panther&#34;.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book has been a wonderful read.  It's a terrific story.  Prospective readers won't be disappointed, but be sure to begin reading this trilogy from book one: \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". The author makes a central point throughout the novels that women endure considerable abuse under men, yet are a very strong and resilient group nonetheless.
B000ID37RM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Scout has always been my favorite character. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made. It's wonderful & it teaches great lessons about being different from others.
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|This movie is puzzling and disturbing until the redemption in the final scenes of the movie.  Hesher is an odd combination of crook and coyote but with his own wisdom you understand in the end.<br />Played flawlessly and fiercely by Joseph Gorgon-Levitt, Hesher is a FORCE.<br />Natalie Portman is perfect in her portrayal of one of us 99%.  Rainn Wilson is also spinnin' some acting magic in this one.<br />Devin Brochu is the actor who begins the film, and incredibly, for one so young amongst so much talent, he shines bright and is as strong within the ensemble as any (great job, Devin!)<br />And oddly, once viewed, it renews faith even in what can be the oddest of families, friendship, and surviving.<br />I wouldn't recommend it for young children, some of it is (necessarily) too raw, but, for anyone who had had to struggle, this film will sweeten our struggles.<br />Ten Thousand Stars!  and give Joe and Rainn and Natalie and Devin and &#34;Grandma&#34; Oscars early and be done with it.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Well, this game is amazing( graphics, attacks, and scenario). The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because it needs so much space to download.
B006X9EUUS|5.0|Again, Sinead puts out an amazing allbum.  Not since the Lion and tha Cobra has she hit the mark this well, I feel.  Queen of Denmark and V.I.P. stand out for me, however there's not a dud on the entire thing.  I was sorry when she had to cancel her tour due to a scientific diagnoisis of &#34;you're not quite right&#34; but she's unstoppable, at least to her fans, and this album completely sets that in stone.  Where you go and as you do Sinead, may ye wear it well.<br />And this album wears well too - even my 73 year-old Ma likes it.  That's not a small thing.<br />Definitely one of my top five of 2012.  Cheers!
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Same old same old story. Lacking all novelty. Lame parents. Poor misunderstood princess who is just so special....but sadly misunderstood. Lots of predictable stuff happens and then the story ends. Of course the princess finds her true voice and the parents realize how wrong they were.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|This novel at first emphasizes a feisty, accomplished heroine.  Diana Bishop, a young woman who is a tenured Yale professor, is in Oxford researching the history of alchemy. When she requests a manuscript called Ashmole 782, she draws the attention of the magic community, since this work has been missing for centuries. The manuscript is believed to contain powerful secrets about the \\"creatures\\"--witches, demons, and vampires. Each group wants to use Diana to gain access to the work, which disappears again after she returns it. Diana is a witch who has largely ignored her powers.<br /><br />The vampire Matthew Clairmont wants to protect Diana from the creatures trying to use her to get to Ashmole 782. Gradually, they fall in love, which precipitates a major crisis, since  witches and vampires are not supposed to commingle. Once Diana commits to Matthew, she sets herself up for an epic conflict with the magic community. To survive, Diana has to come to terms with her own magic powers.<br /><br />After Diana mates with Matthew, she changes from a self-serving career woman to a team member who fights against a larger cause, the unfair \\"laws\\" of the creature community. As allies forms around Diana, she orders them to obey absolutely their general, Matthew.  Readers who liked Diana as an independent, spirited woman may feel disappointed that she submits herself to Matthew, who is a control freak.<br /><br />Readers will reinvest in Diana if they believe her romance with Matthew is worth the cost. Harkness builds the love story slowly, showing Diana and Matthew preparing meals for each other, doing yoga together, and meeting their families. The book works if the reader accepts it is not about a spunky heroine with career goals, but is about an intelligent woman who accepts her heritage and fights for a cause bigger than herself.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great movie. Action packed. Probably not a movie for kids to see since it has lots of violence ....and language
B003TH14H4|5.0|love this show, nathan fillion is awesome as castle, of course preceded by his role as mal reynolds on firefly!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy read that sucks you in and leaves you wanting more.. can't wait to see movie and read the next book!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|It was a good movie to bring all the different super heros together, but it still was a little cheesy.  Some bad one liners and the relationships between the heroes were a little forced.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I went into this movie expecting a lot and I was not disappointed. Moonrise Kingdom is a very imaginative and well written movie that despite the writers attempts I think is a \\"feel good\\" movie overall. I was hoping that Bill Murray would have a larger comedic role in the movie but he was not the focus of the film at all. Great movie, great comedy and a great overall message. It really makes me miss the good ol days and gives people some prospective.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I really liked it, was better then I thought it would be. had good graphics and a good story line
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I would recommend this movie for all Percy Jackson fans.  It was a perfect blend of friends,family, monsters, imagination, intrigue and adventure.  It was close enough to the story line of the book to satisfy.  Good job!
B009329ZF2|5.0|I really liked this movie and could watch it again. had a great story line and the graphics were great as well.
B004JMY312|5.0|This is a very well done comedy. It is I wonderful children's Halloween movie that's not too scary. It is one of my faves.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I really liked this movie and could watch it again. had a great story line and the graphics were great as well.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Unfortunately this wasn't my favorite book that he's written.  I learned something and I enjoyed it but I got tired of John Corey's sarcasm and constant put downs.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, well done.  I watched movie again after reading the book and it was just as good.  Highly recommended!
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|While the movie isn't quite as in depth as the novel, the basic story is intact. For people who enjoy idealized plots surrounding a lone hero, this movie should have an impact. Warning: can be life-changing for impressionable youths.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|This game was awesome while it lasted. To all the people who say all of these are copying minecraft its true they are but if you know they are knock offs then don't play it otherwise spend $6 on the real game so all you who complain about copiers<br /><br />SHUT UP AND PLAY ANOTHE F***ING GAME
B00992CF6W|5.0|well the title says my question but my opinion on this app is a five star because its just plain fun but remember its not exactly like the Pc or Xbox version so don't hate it until u try it
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Although I am only half way through the book I am enjoying it very much. No it is not just about an old man walking away on his 100th birthday but it is actually about his whole life. It is told in a funny way but with the mystery surrounding him.  By all means at least get the trial and see for yourself. I plan to re-review it when I am completely done. But for now it is a thumbs up!
B000YABS8E|5.0|This is a very cute premise.  A unworldly man raised in a fallout shelter meets a jaded woman and both are charmed by the other. While it is cheesy it is also touching.  Her gay roomate has the best lines delivered withperfect pitch and alicia silverstone sparkles in her own pouty way
B000I9WVY6|5.0|because I served as a jar head and my dad was in desert shield and dessert storm  plus it reminds me alot of why i joinc the usmc's seper fi oorah
B004GJVI5C|3.0|It was good, worth watching, but did not live up to the hype. SPOILER: I couldn't get past the fact that the FBI knew who these guys were, they knew the FBI knew who they were, yet they kept conducting robberies, apparently with no surveillance by the FBI. A little too far fetched.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very good as I do like most of this boooks. Easy to read and pretty clear, though I do skim a lot as I grow older, knowing it is very difficult for me to retain things any more as I near 90.a
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is definitely one of the best Kiss albums in recent times. Its a complete rock & roll masterpiece without any ballads. The band has successfully captured the spirits of the 70's as well as added some new edge to their music. Tommy Thayer does an amazing job on the guitar and is probably the best KISS guitarist since Ace! It's one of the best albums of the year!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Most Grisham books tend to hook you in within the first few chapters.  From there, it's page turning suspence right up until the very end.<br /><br />With this book, Grisham \\"phoned\\" it in.  The classic Grisham style is there.  However, the nail biting suspense seems to be missing.  I won't reveal any plot points but will say the \\"big reveal\\" seems like a bit of a let down rather than an \\"OMG\\" moment.  Doesn't mean that this book isn't a fun read.  It is.<br /><br />Still worth reading, just know going in, that it's just a fun read.  Not the normal suspense, keep 'em guessing til the end style that he's been known for.<br /><br />An off day for a normally good writer is the best way for me to express it.
B001F12J48|2.0|Did not realize the 3-D would be using the out-dated paper blue/red glasses...Will definitely ask more questions in the future. Disappointed.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|American History X is an excellent, powerful film. Norton's performance is oscar worthy, in my opinion. It is not for the squeamish, however.
B004047XXO|2.0|Did not realize the glasses were going to be the 'old' 'outdated' paper, red/blue 3-D glasses...Will ask more questions in the future..
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Different kind of story for Grisham.  I enjoyed most of it.  A little drawn out in some chapters. But, I enjoyed it!!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|It's a little spooky having all your devices syncing to one location, but the convenience is beyond wonderful.  My favorite aspect is taking pictures with my smart phone and having them sync with my laptop the minute I get home and switch my phone to wifi. I hope my privacy is secure!?
B003ZK50SY|5.0|I received this book so fast and could not be happier.David Sedaris is my favorite author and this book has turned into my favorite of all his books and I've read them all! If a person is looking for a good book any David Sedaris will hit the spot, but this one is extremely hard to put down!
B009B0L324|5.0|After watching the dvd of this concert, it is awesome to just listen to the cd. The feeling you get from the argentinian audience is electrifing.  All the classics are there plus a few tracks from the most recent studio album Black Ice. I agree with other posts in reference to Phil Rudd. Chris Slade is an awesome drummer and it is evident in the album Live from 1992, but Phil Rudd has that Ac/dc grove. He is family , and it is great to have him in this live album. Close your eyes and enjoy the audience singing not only the lyrics but the guitar riffs in almost every song like Highway to hell or You shook me all night long just to mention a couple.<br />Powerful concert!!  I can't wait for the studio album that will follow hopefully in 2013.<br />AC/DC rocks!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games. I cannot stop playing this one. really relaxing as well. Love having a challenge to do.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This game is not user friendly.  It's very slow moving and limited in playing area.<br />  I would not recommend it for anyone.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|A very well-done family movie that all can enjoy. Safe for the kids, but enjoyable for adults as well. Lots of life lessons can be learned from this one. And even though we already know the ending from history, it is great to see how it all came about.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I am one of the biggest Kid Rock fans around, and my first listen to this album wasn't positive at all, but I say why not try it again? Now I LOVE IT!!!! I believe it is Kid's best album right behind Devil Without a Cause! Can't wait to see him in Detroit this summer!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is by far one of the best shows in a long time. Great acting and human drama shown against the backdrop of a zombie apocolypse.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The premise and execution of plot were great. The characters were good, but I wished I could like the heroine more! The themes for her tend to be Angry and Unwilling for most of the story.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The book is interesting, to say the least, but I think there was to much repitition in the sexual content which I find myself skipping over in the book three.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great movie. A Christmas classic. Everyone in the family will enjoy it. We have made it a family tradition to watch it every year at the beginning of the Christmas season to kick off the holiday!
0547884591|5.0|Just flipping through this massive tome, you are almost guaranteed to learn something unusual. I've only had the book a few hours, and I already know what kind of cocktail to drink to avoid insulin spikes, how to memorize a deck of cards, and exactly what kind of OXO spatula I should buy. If that doesn't make sense to you, then you don't understand Tim's unique blend of infotainment. But you will...
068484267X|5.0|His writings helped me get interesting in reading. I really hadn't read that much at all until I came across this book when it first came out.
B009X01C64|5.0|The Fire 8.9 fits snugly into this well-made case, and the construction has a quality feel.  The leather seems very nice as well.  It rotates so the stand feature works with the Kindle in either portrait or landscape mode.  I like the feature that the Kindle turns on when you open the cover and off when you close it, because I find the power button on the new Kindles to be awkward, and this feature makes it unnecessary.<br /><br />Unlike my similar Marware case for my 7\\" Fire HD, this one rotates 180 degrees, so the problem with some apps being upside down doesn't happen with the larger Fire and case.  Nice change!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|In The Time Keeper it goes back and forth between characters, so that you don't get to know that much about their lives.  I feel if he expanded on the characters' lives, the book would be of value.  I think the book is so small. and the price is outrageous.  I have read better books by Mitch Album.<br /><br />Julie
B0095VPBM2|4.0|lightning fast speed, and i'm not overclocking.  built a nice little htpc using the asrock mini itx fm2 mobo.  i've paired it with a samsung 830 128 gig ssd, and 8 gig ram as well.  boots up quick and videos look great in high def.
B009R8DJ72|4.0|I liked the book because it will make you giggle when you read and other people seeing you laugh will make you look dum so I recommend you read this at home
B007M45PMU|5.0|this is one of my new favorites.  there's maybe one song i don't love on the whole record.  plays well in any weather, mood, or situation.
B000FA675C|5.0|This book has opened up a new world of thought for me.  It has presented religion in a whole new light.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As good as ever, but it is more violent. I did prefer the less graphic seasons, but I still really enjoyed it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as well as the whole Percy Jackson series.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I payed 7 dollars for this and it changed to aa dollar that is rediculas I should get. my six dollars back then if its one dollar
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Truly one of the great Wodehouse series and based on the books. The acting and production of this masterpiece are outstanding. It's a steal at under $20 and this is for the complete set!!<br />You'll love the eccentric characters, the accurate period sets and costumes. Immerse yourself in this one. You'll be keeping this set and not throwing it onto Ebay.
B0006HB84Y|4.0|Quick, excellent service; excellent album. Quick, excellent service; excellent album. Quick, excellent service; excellent album. (Isn't this simple comment enough?)
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Midnight in Paris is one of my favorite movies. I'm so glad it is available on blue ray. The dvd arrived in perfect shape. I look forward to enjoying it many times.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Quick, excellent service. Wow! This is an amazing movie, made even more relevant by our having visited the Stasi museum in [East] Berlin.
B0036G94DY|5.0|Needed to replace a fan in my computer.  In minutes I was back up and running.  Fan is very quiet.
0345803507|5.0|the book is very good. sometimes you can stop reading it. to see what will happened to them. and hope there will be more books
B008GAXUSK|5.0|Very rarely does one come across a complete symphony collection from any composer where the entire set can be said to be definitive without caveat.<br /><br />I have heard Abbado, Harnoncourt, Muti in full sets and many, many individual performances from Beecham to the original instrument brigade and this release trumps them all. If you love Schubert, do not hesitate. You will hear counterpoint, individual parts and other details you have not heard before. The transparency is astonishing.And the phrasing and rhythm are mind-blowing.<br /><br />The early classical symphonies are taken at a pretty good clip, but without slurring and exhibiting playing of incredible skill. I particularly enjoyed #2, apparently devilishly difficult to play, and always a favorite of mine. Not until the \\"Unfinished\\" does Minkowski slow it down. In fact the first movement is slower than average, and much slower than Carlos Kleiber, a previous top contender. But what a performance! The Great C Major  also starts at a more deliberate pace than some, but picks up as it goes along. There are a lot of great versions of this last symphony, but this is now at the top of my list.<br /><br />I would recommend listening to this set from the beginning to fully appreciate the journey that Schubert took. If you're like me, you'll have a tough time taking a break!<br /><br />I had not heard of this orchestra or conductor before, but I'll be looking into more of their work.<br /><br />The recording is immaculate - nothing is hidden in these scores.The contrapuntal details from all the string sections and individual woodwinds are laid bare.<br /><br />I'm not going to dissect each symphony - they are all wonderful. If you want to sample the tracks, go to AllMusic.com and input Schubert Symphonies Minkowski. You'll get 30secs. or so of each movement. If you're not motivated to go to Amazon and buy this set for $30 or so after listening, you don't like Schubert!<br /><br />My new release find of the year!
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|So true and concise. Really reflects today's feminists. Great stories as well. If you like light hearted feminism you found the right book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like mazes, you will certainly enjoy this app.  As the puzzles get harder, it becomes even more fun.
B00846TTDG|1.0|acting is terrible. plot is terrible. movie is terrible. this is just a glorified recruitment video that i had to suffer through
B007SGLZP8|3.0|There are 2 books within 'The Racketeer' by John Grisham. The first 2/3 of the book comprise one book. This is a fast paced story of a man in the witness protection program- a man who makes a deal with the Government to secure his freedom and hide out from the man he gave up to get the deal. That's a pretty good book.<br /><br />The last 1/3 of the book- and I won't do a 'spolier' alert here- basically negates everything you think you know about the main character. I think Grisham cheated a bit. There are misleading items strewn throughout the front story. The misleading items make the end of the book somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />If you decide to read 70% of 'The Racketeer' you will really enjoy it. Prepare for a good meal with a really disappointing desert.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Character driven series... more than zombies and gross stuff. We keep getting lots of surprises when it comes to who's going to survive!
B00915G6WQ|3.0|It hurts me to give Dexter less than Five stars, and the show itself deserves five stars. This season is fantastic too.  What I am commenting on  here is the poor dvd sets Showtime produces. The Dexter DVD sets have no, or next to no, extras on them that actually relate to the show. Instead, they make you go online to find any extras. Then they load the set you are actually paying for down with single episodes of other Showtime series they want to try and get you to buy, most of which you will have no interest in at all. Then, for the past two seasons, they have put ads for their other shows, several minutes worth, at the start of every disk in the set,and engineered it so you cannot skip or fast forward though the ads to get to the menu. This means that forever, every time you load a disk, you will have to sit through the ads with no way to avoid them. It really shows Showtime's total disrespect and distain for their customers. I would advise waiting on ordering this set and see if Showtime is going to pull  the same shoddy tricks with their viewers and customers they have pulled on the last two DVD sets. At that point decide if you are willing to put up with Showtime's dirty tricks. Will I still end up buying this set? Probably,since I love the show and this season. But by not preordering so far in advance I hope a message is sent to Showtime that they are abusing their customer loyalty and to let them know that their tricks are alienating their customers. I for one will never by a Showtime dvd set other than Dexter, that is for sure. Showtime cannot be trusted.<br /><br />Adding this to my entry here on 04-19-2013: I just learned that there will be no Dexter extras other than the biographies of the actors again. What is being put on the disks are as follows:<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />Ray Donovan (Pilot Episode) on Disc 4 on DVD; via UltraViolet on Blu-ray<br />First two episodes of the Second Season of The Borgias (DVD only)<br />First two episodesof the First Season of House of Lies (via E-Bridge Technology on DVD)<br />Biographies (DVD only)<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, these are not \\"Special Features\\".  They are advertising to try and get you to buy their other series as well as Dexter. Special Features, in my opinion, are extras that relate to the show you are buying. Since this follows their same pattern as the previous couple of years releases for Dexter, I fear they will also treat their customers and fans as idiots and include the forced advertising at the start of every disk as well. At the price they are asking, I for one am going to hold off buying this season of Dexter for a year and see if the price drops to something more reasonable for a bare bones release loaded with annoying forced ads and unrelated episodes of other shows.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a wonderfully written book, could not put it down until it was done!  Great story beyond the typical love story!
1469984202|5.0|I \\"bought\\" the original Wool for my Kindle (it was free) and really enjoyed the story. I was then pleasantly surprised to find out that the author published several more installments in the story. Publishing these books himself is great since the low cost for the ebook makes the barrier to entry so low.<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical though that the quality of the story would continue to be as good as the story continued - it's a hard thing for an author to keep the plot as riveting and exciting with each new book.<br /><br />However I was completely wrong in this - each new installment of the story is just as good, if not better, than the last. The insane desire I felt during the first book to keep reading because I just had to know how it ended right now did not diminish at all as the series continued.<br /><br />If you liked the first book, and you've read all these reviews, you probably don't need to be told any more that you should just go ahead and get the Omnibus and continue the story - go do it already!
B005URRCUY|5.0|i love the black keys and this cd is great!!!! plan to get some more cds of the back keys soon.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|G5 has mastered another one.  Just enough difficulty to keep it interesting.  I only had to use the hints once in awhile.  Great game and definitely recommend it.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Nothing spectacular here.  Graphics are decent, animation is smooth, game play speed - good.  I've looked extensively for a good \\"breakout\\" type game.  This one isn't great, but it is the best I've found and since it was a FAOTD, the price was perfect!<br /><br />This one does have items that you can catch which makes things happen (paddle longer or shorter, multiple balls at once, slow the ball down, etc).<br /><br />I'd have given it a 4 or 5 if it had better graphics and more goodies falling (i.e. bullets, etc).
B007EECSFA|3.0|I have been a little disappointed.  I have not found this book as interesting as some of the author's previous books.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Loved Percy Jackson and I read those out loud to my kids.  They were entertaining for all.  This is just a continuation of the Percy Jackson adventures.  Now my boys (8 and 11 years old) are reading them by themselves.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is entertaining to play and does not require much thought. It seems to benefit eye and hand coordination skills.
B008458O3S|4.0|This game is easy enough to learn that my 3 year old loves it (puzzle and trains, what could be better!).  But it's challenging enough that some levels even I have difficulty.
B009M4KTTC|5.0|Gotta love the Kid! Its like a holiday when he drops a new cd! Thanks for the music and the good times that come with it.
0547884591|5.0|I'm really busy at work and always find an excuse to not cook (I literally take out or eat out 90% of meals), but this book and Tim's excitement for food has inspired me to do it! It is particularly appealing because there is on ramp to cooking for a busy person like me, with easy dishes, and a guide that's not just a \\"cook book\\" (which are targeted not at me but people already in the habit).
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you need to kill some time and want some entertainment without spinning<br />your brain cells to the point of distraction, then this is the game to choose.  Just challenging<br /> enough without being tedious. Love the option of random deal or winning deal.
0452289963|5.0|I have red all books from eckart tolle,<br /><br />I lived quite a while in india studying for the yoga acharya, also studying rosicrucian teachings for 20 years,<br /><br />my favorite philosophy is vedanta philosophy as well as the books of vivekananda, swami satyananda (yoga school of bihar) and quite a few zen books,<br /><br />tolle in my opinion - is the best read when it comes to western authors, this book - and \\"the power of now\\" explained my experiences I had in india when I got my mantra from swamiji - for days it was like I could touch the light, I bacame the observer (sanskrit - sakshi bav state - witness state) .... which lasts till today ...<br /><br />today beside vedanta, yoga and zen - I definitly recommend to everyone tolle´s books ;-)<br /><br />opal, FRC °+
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've seen the movie in HD, but in 3D it's a glorious experience!<br /><br />If you have a 3D player and 3D TV you have to get this movie!<br /><br />I just love the story and the characters. Having it in 3D in my own home is amazing!
B0081BU42O|4.0|Plot was confusing but very creative charactures and fantastic vision of the far future. The ship minds were like gods with an attitude.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Got this for my grandson who is a Leggo enthusiast.  Looks like one he will really enjoy.  A Good gift
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Enjoyed the movie very much, although having read the books was really helpful in understanding the story because so much of the background material wasn't included in the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is my second time reading it and i loved it even more than the first time i read it!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I haven't seen an AWESOME movie in a LOOONG time!!! FINALLY!! YAY!!  LOVE Iron Mans' character and sarcasm! and THOR!!  They are my favorite!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The DVD's arrived in on time and in great condition. i bought a DVD set marked used but it was definitely like new. The material content is outstanding.
0547884591|5.0|As someone who has been inspired by the man himself, and both of his books in different ways, I can safely say that this book will be a great read. I seriously could not think of a gift for most family and friends that I'd be more excited to give them than the latest from Tim Ferriss.<br /><br />As someone who has been able to improve my overall lifestyle through Tim's philosophies and tactics, I am hopeful and excited to see how he will inspire my friends and family with this book for everyone.<br /><br />Tim is also one of the few people I've met who have an undeniably strong presence in the room.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|A fun, well designed 2D scroller.  Looks good, plays well, and fun.  Not the most complex game out there, but the developers put enough in to keep you interested.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I first discovered this band while at work listening to the radio, but it took me some time to buy the album. I wish I didn't wait. I have loved every song on this album. The lyrics are amazing and then you couple it with stunning and unique vocals. It is just a pleasure to listen to and has yet to leave my car. One of my favorite songs is Classy Girls. Just awesome.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This was another great movie by Disney!  My daughter loves Tinker Bell and this is a very touching movie.  I found myself getting tearful a few times.  She's getting it for her birthday in a few weeks.  A definite keeper!!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Thank you.  Great.  On time, good condition, no problems.  Enjoyed the movie, had to watch it twice to catch all that I wanted.  Will watch again soon, maybe.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Simply stated I loved it. Finished in less than 24 hours. Couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it for Rapp fans.
B007IL5D3S|5.0|Rapp is the last man you want to mess with! If you liked the other books you'll love this. Rapp tells it like it is, sees through the crap and goes after anyone that's involved. And kills them without any fuss, obviously! I wouldn't have it any other way :)
0142000671|5.0|Read with my daughter for school.  Good book and was glad to follow along while she read and discuss book after we both finished.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|this is a great game and on the app store its 3 bucks. Its a fun but challenging game that you can spend hours playing. Rovio outdid themselves this time.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a big Nelson DeMille fan - I've read almost all of his books. This one (The Panther) was probably the weakest of all of his work. Just too much wisecracking and goofing off.
B0030P1WKY|5.0|reading this book has given me one of those experiences that I'm being described with an accuracy to the point like by no other astrologist. As a matter of fact this is the only astrological book I've read and returned to, but this book has given me a perspective that those astrologists making a map out of your date and site of birth haven't been able to, a perspective that explains many of the features I've been struggling with. It is deliberating and releasing to read this book because it describes your dysfunctionality from a different angle than any others, at the same time with warmth empathy and understanding. You also get some ideas how to work on your stuff.
B005N95JA4|1.0|Ok, we all know that Some Girls is a classic, amazing album.  So why is this 2009 remastered cd (and the It's Only Rock and Roll remaster) the worst sounding disc in my entire collection?  Distorted. Shrill. Compressed. Unlistenable. There are perhaps some of the nicer ways that I can describe the album's sound. Ok, maybe that wasn't being too nice  :-)<br /><br />2009 (and 2011 deluxe edition) is the 3rd or 4th generation of Stones re-masters, so it is inexcusable to release a cd that sounds so poor and so distorted.  I have Beggar's Banquet 2002 DSD re-master which sounds very nice, and some other Virgin-era and prior-era stones albums which sound just fine.<br /><br />I'm not sure who had the idea that making an \\"unlistenable\\" version of a great album is somehow an improvement over prior versions.  Perhaps the record company is setting people up to buy a new \\"decent\\" sounding version of the album for a lot of money on the 5th or 6th remaster.  And did I mention that Stones tix are $650 in London (through Ticketmaster), for seats nowhere even close to the stage?  hmmmm.... no thanks.
B0086700CM|5.0|Both of my children love this game, they are 5 and 9.  They have even gotten my husband to play the game as well.  They love all the features and different options you can get when you earn money.  I have 6 people now that can run for them.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|This movie was great. I saw it in the theater. I watch a lot of romantic comedies, including Twilight. What a breath of fresh air to watch something different, artistic. I finally used my brain to enjoy a movie. It was great!
075669812X|5.0|I ordered this for my die-hard 7-year old Ninjago fan and didn't expect much, since the price was so low.  I received it yesterday and it's super nice - a good quality, thick book with a small ninja doll and all the info on Ninjago characters.  I'll probably order a couple more and save them as birthday gifts.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I never can get enough Reacher,,,action, great characters, and plots.  I am trying to read each and every one.  More more more
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I never expected the ending to be so intense.  I had tears that made it hard to read the last few pages.  I read this through my social workers eyes.  I am looking forward to the second book as soon as I am done writing this.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Reading the book I couldn't wait to put my shoes on (or even flip-flops) and go running. The book is not encouraging to start running, but presents it as the most natural and wonderful activity, as a part of living close to nature.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Ninety percent of this book is the lead in to a quick, bloody conclusion. The writing is so crafty and hilarious though, that it is impossible to put down. Well done, Mr. DeMille!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.  The constant ads for other games is excessive, but the game is great for relaxing....nice music.<br /><br />Update: After I earn achievements, I keep getting a \\"kiip error\\" message. So I took off a star.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Short and sweet: acting sucks (mostly), CGI is iffy (when it is in there) and the plot is terrible.<br /><br />But yet, it's everything I had hoped for in an Expendables sequel. Don't expect much other than to just be entertained. Great for that!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am never disappointed in Mr. Grisham and his books.  I look forward to reading the next one.  Never boring and always captivating.  Must read!
