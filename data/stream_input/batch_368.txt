B000089RVR|4.0|It is a really good CD, although it's not as good as No Angel. Fans waited a long time for this, and I guess we were expecting something better. What we got was good, but it definately could have been a lot better considering how long we waited.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's exactly the kind of show hardcore sci-fi fans were waiting for. Brutal at times, entertaining, and almost always brilliant, even if every other sentence uttered by the Captain had a double-negative. The special effects alone are phenomenal. At first the Western theme seemed a little odd, but they rolled with it perfectly. It's a perfect show and a total shame.<br />Buy it, enjoy it, and then cry..
1574530011|5.0|There is no better human voice to tell this story than that of Dr. Needleman's.  The audio version of this amazing story is a nice supplement to a hard copy reading of the book.  The story itself is deceivingly simple.  A highly profound read with great meaning layered throughout the text.  Recommended to all wisdom seekers of any age.
B000099T2L|2.0|crazy in love great song - baby boy grat song - overplayed to death - yes  - me myself and I ok song- beyonce?  completely overrated - I mean extrmeley overrated - she is a good singer not great...this album has been completely overrated by the critics.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We went to see this show thinking it was only a prequel to the Wizard of Oz. Little did we know it would encompass the time before, during and after The Wizard. The actresses voices are dynamite and couldn't be better. Then, of course, there's Joel Grey who does an awesome job as the Wizard. It's almost as if these parts were written specifically for them! (One was, actually!). If you like the Wizard of Oz, I strongly suggest you see the show. But if you like good Broadway tunes, this is the CD for you! It will give you a whole new appreciation for the movie!
0767836286|4.0|Arlington Road is a supurb film. The acting was supurb all the way through, although i didnt like the actress who played Brooke much. The plot was great, a terrorist living next door to you. Makes you think who your neighbours really are :))) It keeps you guessing all the way through with its greats twists and turns. The best part of the film, was the ending. I predicted at the end Mr Farraday would save the day, and the terrorist would be defeated. But for a good change the terrorists won. Which goes to show that in life, there isnt always happy endings.
B00008MNYS|5.0|This guy has it all. So talented , so sexy, such an entertainer.<BR>I don't understand why he hasn't caught on in the U.S. He's bigger in Canada by far.  I love his cockiness. If only he would come to North America to tour. This CD is (I think) his best. I have had this cd since it came out and every week I have a different favorite song.  Right now it is Nan's Song.<BR>Robbie has an awesome voice and is one of those rare singers that can sing live. \\"How Peculiar\\" since I've learned what it is about is another of my favorites.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|I bought her missunderstood album that was a kicker this one is not anything never really realizes itself - its not a strong album and there are parts where it could have had great songs but they mess it up....not worth the money.  Burn any track you like if you even find one.
B00005V9HA|5.0|Wowzers! Now before I start my views may be a tad bias seeing as I'm a HUGE Re-animator fan :) . I watched &quot;Bride of Re-animator&quot; before seeing &quot;The Re-animator&quot; so was I ever in for a big surprise when I got my hand on this masterpeice! I would have been happy with just the movie itself. But with all the extras the come in this package I was completely blown away and left knowing ALOT about how this movie was made and many funny stories that came from it.<br />Now the DVD is full of extras. I LOVE The Commentary by producer Brian Yuzna and actors Jeffrey Combs, Robert Sampson, Barbara Crampton, and Bruce Abbott on this movie! It's is full of laughs, memories, info and just a bunch of friends re-calling events! Jeff Combs remembers ALOT of his lines from the movie, Bruce Abbott has been using a promotional &quot;Re-animator&quot; paperholder as an ashtray threw out the years , and Barbara recalls her moms &quot;favorite scene&quot;. There are TONS of deleted scenes ranging from Herbert Shooting up with the the re-animation juice to Herbert crying! Lots of great interviews here, the interview with Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna is gold, they go over casting, shooting, and really funny stories of when the first time they saw the finished product. Another favorite feature of mine is the photo gallery, I laughed my way threw all the many photos and you can tell everyone had a great time on the set (my favorite photo is David Gale under the desk with his head threw it and Jeffery Combs helping him smoke). There are many more extras that are informative and funny. This DVD adds greater quality and sound making &quot;The Re-animator&quot; a must have.
B00008NRI8|5.0|This movie is hilarious and Sandra Bullock takes it a cut above the usual romantic comedy. Handsome Hugh Grant and quirky Sandra Bullock make up this thoroughly enjoyable movie, from Lucy (Bullock) ordering huge portions of Chinese and laying under wrecking balls in protest, to George (Grant) and his little boy attitude. A delightful watch. Enjoyed this movie as much or more than &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; also starring Bullock. A must see for a Sandra Bullock fan (me)!!!<br />Favorite Quotes:<br />------------------------------<BR>Lucy Kelson: You are the most selfish human being on the planet! <BR>George Wade: Well that's just silly. Have you met everyone on the planet? <BR>-------------------------------<BR>George Wade: Well, we obviously can't leave you alone with that stapler. <BR>-------------------------------<BR>Helen Wade: Would you like anything? <BR>George Wade: I could really go for some Milk Duds. <BR>Helen Wade: We don't have any, I could send out for one. <BR>George Wade: Oh no, don't be ridiculous. If you're going to send out, get a whole box.<BR>-------------------------------<BR>Lucy Kelson: Please don't tell me you called me out of a wedding to pick out a suit! <BR>-------------------------------<BR>Enjoy the movie! You'll love it, promise!<br />~ProvGirl~

B0000C1733|5.0|First off, the selection of songs for this CD is excellent. However...I don't say this about many bands, but The Red Hot Chili Peppers have such a long string of excellent music that it is a shame to lump it into one \\"Best of\\" CD.<br />I know \\"Best of\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" are totally subjective, but there is so much of The Peppers' work that this compilation does not cover. Anybody who has heard tunes like \\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\" and \\"Get Up and Jump\\" will yearn for more material from the early RHCP era.<br />It's nice to see \\"Soul To Squeeze\\" included on this CD, and they picked the best songs from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic.\\"<br />Excellent CD, but you owe it to yourself to pick up all the Chili Peppers' albums (with the possible exception of \\"One Hot Minute\\"---just my personal call!). I'm not a Red Hot Chili Peppers fanatic who buys every piece of RHCP memorabilia--- I'm simply an all-around music fanboy who honestly thinks the Peppers are really that good!

B000002LCK|5.0|Shortly after Ian Curtis committed suicide in 1980, it appeared as if his band Joy Division had died with him, and its members would now have to give up what were once very promising careers. But the surviving members weren't going to give up that easy & after changing their name to New Order (with the addition of keyboardist Gillian Gilbert & Joy Division guitarist Bernard Sumner taking over vocal duties), they released their first single \\"Ceremony\\" to modest commercial success, but substantial raves in the dance club underground. New Order released four studio albums in the first half of the 1980s, then in 1987, created an early career-capper with the unique retrospective SUBSTANCE.<br />Certainly smarter than your average greatest-hits collection, SUBSTANCE mostly is a gathering of New Order's early singles that never appeared on their albums, along with 12\\" single mixes that perhaps had become rare almost immediately after their initial release. 24 songs of these types are here on SUBSTANCE for posterity, but instead of it being another way of bringing royalities to the band, it's an extremely fine introduction to New Order, who at this point were just on the cusp of mainstream chart success.<br />New Order's debut single \\"Ceremony\\" was actually one of the last songs Joy Division ever wrote, and it hints at a possible lightening up that the band may have been undergoing at the time of Ian's death. It certainly is much warmer than the engaging coldness of most Joy Division music, and one can only wonder what it would have been like had Ian lived long enough to record it. \\"In A Lonely Place\\" is another great Joy Division cast-off that New Order manages to make into their own.<br />It was apparent that New Order, from the beginning, was mostly a singles band with the abundance of EPs & singles that featured songs not available anywhere else. One such work is the 1981 EP EVERYTHING'S GONE GREEN, which has two songs featured on SUBSTANCE: the Krautrock-inspired title track & \\"Cries & Whispers\\". Both of these songs have New Order still channeling the spirit of Joy Division (especially in Bernard's vocals), but this is understandable with the songs coming from a time when the impact of Ian's suicide was still being felt.<br />From their 1982 EP FACTUS 8, \\"Temptation\\" (re-recorded for this album) came out as a single right before New Order's landmark 1983 album POWER, CORRUPTION & LIES, and is a good sign of things to come on that masterpiece. That album's undoubted highpoint \\"Blue Monday\\" is featured on here & it still is a sound to behold because it indicates that New Order had at last found their niche in dramatic, techno-based pop. Its B-side \\"The Beach\\" (also on P,C&L) makes a fine counterpart to that all-time great of techno music, and it was perhaps no accident that the 2000 film THE BEACH maybe was inspired by that song (New Order would even contribute a new song to the soundtrack). \\"Procession\\", \\"Mesh\\" & \\"Hurt\\" were also on that EP, featuring the synthesizer (thanks to distaff member Gillian) more of a focus than before, another sign that New Order had found its own way.<br />1985's LOW-LIFE was still more of a hit on the dance charts than pop, but it showed New Order willing to expand their audience base away from just the clubs. \\"Perfect Kiss\\" & \\"Subculture\\" are represented on here, with the former in a much longer 12\\" mix. 1986's BROTHERHOOD further opened the commercial market a little more with \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" its most famous entry & the longer dance mix here was already a standard even before it finally became a pop chart entry in another remix. \\"State Of The Nation\\" is also improved upon from its original album counterpart with its extended version on SUBSTANCE. \\"Shellshock\\" originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1986 film PRETTY IN PINK & while it is often considered a rush job, it again shows the move towards lighter, even optimistic material for New Order.<br />A great many songs on SUBSTANCE maketheir first official appearance on here, so be glad you've got them here. 1983's \\"Confusion\\" (re-recorded for SUBSTANCE) & \\"Thieves Like Us\\" (both also included in instrumental mixes) were New Order's successful collaborations with pioneer hip-hop producer Arthur Baker (of \\"Planet Rock\\" fame) with the former even making it to #5 on the Club Play Singles chart & #71 on the R&B surveys (not too bad for a band full of Whites). The old-school rap leanings of these two songs indicate New Order had more than just mopey techno-pop on their minds. \\"Lonesome Tonight\\", \\"Murder\\", \\"Kiss Of Death\\", \\"Shame Of The Nation\\" (I'm not sure if these are B-sides or previously unheard works) & \\"1963\\" (I think recorded at the same time as \\"True Faith\\") all have their first-ever showing on SUBSTANCE, proving that maybe New Order's well of creativity is probably a bottomless one.<br />Finally, we get to the song that at last won New Order a wider mainstream audience. \\"True Faith\\" was the first single to cross over to the Hot 100 & did a fantastic job, topping out at #32. With this song, New Order made official their willingness to act positive on record for a change. Bernard Sumner sounds just buoyant on \\"True Faith\\" & in that stiff-upper-lip English tradition, he might actually be smiling as he sings this. Gillian's keyboards further heighten the good spirits, indicating maybe the missing element that was needed for New Order to cross over into the mainstream was positivity. I'll even go so far as to say that \\"True Faith\\" might be New Order's finest 6 minutes on record (and I am including \\"Blue Monday\\").<br />New Order managed to turn out quite a body of work in the first 6 or 7 years of their career, and SUBSTANCE features the best of it in a way that is unique if nothing else. With 12\\" mixes favored over official album versions & in some cases, actually going back into the studio to re-record songs all over again, SUBSTANCE is certainly not your average greatest hits record (1995's (THE BEST OF) NEW ORDER & 2002's INTERNATIONAL are the ones to get for that purpose). Sounds difficult & hard to understand? Perhaps, but it nevertheless is still an excellent way for neophytes to get into New Order & just maybe might influence them to try out the original albums as well.their first official appearance on here, so be glad you've got them here. 1983's \\"Confusion\\" (re-recorded for SUBSTANCE) & \\"Thieves Like Us\\" (both also included in instrumental mixes) were New Order's successful collaborations with pioneer hip-hop producer Arthur Baker (of \\"Planet Rock\\" fame) with the former even making it to #5 on the Club Play Singles chart & #71 on the R&B surveys (not too bad for a band full of Whites).

B0000028VT|5.0|This is a wonderful album.  My favorite song on the album is &quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot;.  It completely blows Hero out of the water.  The only problem I have witht his album is that the American release didn't get two amazing songs; &quot;Everything Fades Away&quot; and &quot;Do You Think Of Me&quot;.  Those are two amazing tracks that I highly recomend people finding and/or downloading. They would have meshed in on this classic beautifully.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I first saw this film when I was about 14 or 15, my parents let me watch it because of the subject matter, and when it had ended I was sobbing. For unlike an average rated R film, the material in the film that resulted in such a rating is necessary to tell the story of a man who through the course of the story evolves from a profiteer to a righteous gentile. This is not a film, but a work of art that has no equal in its power and emotional effect over an audience. To give this film anything less than 5 five stars would be a disservice to it. This is a must own for any DVD collector.

B0000D14JV|5.0|&quot;Freaky Friday&quot; stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan, Chad Michael Murray, and others.  This is one the funniest comedies released in 2003.  This remake of the 1976 version, starring Jodie Foster, lives up to the original.  The writers update the events very well, while adding new and original elements.  The laughs begin before Tess(Curtis) and Anna(Lohan) switch bodies because of a fortune cookie.  However, the laughs become more frequent in their struggle to get their bodies back.  Such hilarious scenes will be unforgettable to audiences.  Jamie Lee Curtis's Golden Globe nominated role(Best Actress in a Comedy Film) is one of her best in her 25-year acting career.  She, like all the other actors, adds her own sense of humor into the movie, offering audiences more viewing pleasure.  This film may not have been so magical if it wasn't for her.  Lindsay Lohan proves in her role that she'll be a big name actress in the near future.  &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; is a great movie for those looking for a great comedy.  This will surely keep audiences entertained for a long time.
0780626966|5.0|I just ordered this box set, and can't wait for it to come in the mail tomorrow.  I have seen all movies previously, and love each one for different reasons.<br />Nightmare on Elm Street 1:<br />  This is a great movie.  Though like others have said, I wish it had more Freddy in it.  He was truely a scary figure in this film.  This was also my first time seeing Johnny Depp in a movie, and it's obvious his death scene is the most memorable.<br />Nightmare on Elm Street 2:<br />  This nightmare sorta through me off track.  Instead of him being in dreams, he seems to be more like the devil and invade peoples bodies.  While this film is probably the worst of the series, it's still a good watch.  For me, the scariest scene is towards the begining when Freddy takes over the school bus of children.<br />Nightmare on Elm Street 3:<br />  I remember renting this movie over and over.  While some parts in this movie were rather comical, other parts are extremely frightening.  I think it's scary because these children are locked up in a mental ward, and are completely useless. No one believes them because of the situation they're in.  I wish Patricia would have stayed for the 4th installment.<br />Nightmare on Elm Street 4:<br />  This movie would have been much better if it had kept Patricia.  But the other girl did a good job at being killed none the less. I didn't really enjoy watching Freddy in a classroom full of bright light.  I think that's when he starts being comical.  He's much better and scarier in dark places.  Still, this movie was good, and introduced us to Alice, the star of the 5th nightmare.<br />Nightmare on Elm Street 5:<br />  Despite what other reviewers have said, I love this instalment of the series. The idea that Freddy would invade an unborn childs mind in order to kill his mother is beyond genius. I also love how you really get an idea of who Freddy was before becoming this monster.  You meet his mother, and learn her horrible story and Freddys unfortunante conception.<br />Freddys Dead:<br />  This movie was okay.  It goes into more detail about how Freddy became who he is.  This had to be the funniest Nightmare yet.  I don't know which was funnier: Freddy playing video games, Roseanne &amp; Tom Arnold being thrown in, or Johnny Depp making a camio after he was killed off the original nightmare. Either way, this film is great because it lets you know Freddy, and almost makes you feel sorry for him.  You also get introduced to those little pesky dream things that took over Freddys body.<br />Wes Cravens New Nightmare:<br />  I loved this film.  It did give Freddy a 'real' feel.  I thought it was genius for Wes Craven himself to be in the film. Robert England played himself as well. The only complaint I have with this movie is how they made Freddy look.  The new and improved Freddy for the 90's isn't even that scary looking.  He looks like he has muscle exposed on his face instead of being burnt, and his new high tech glove reminds me of the terminator. Also, his clothes have changed. He looks like he's wearing Gucci instead of the same 1970's clothes he had on when he was burnt.  I suggest if they make anymore Freddy movies, they go back to the leather glove, burnt body, and 70's apparell.<br />In many ways, I wish this box set wasn't released untill they were finished making Freddy movies.  Then I wouldn't have to buy an extra movie that won't fit in the box in January.  I haven't seen Freddy VS Jason yet, but I hope he isn't the same freddy we seen in the new nightmare.<br />Overall, the Nightmare On Elm Street series is a great set for anyone who loves horror films with a twist.unfortunante conception.<br />Freddys Dead:<BR>    This movie was okay.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Okay, I'd like to know what they were thinking (or taking) when they created the character Jar Jar Binks. JJB ruins the film. It could have been 5/5 without JJB. I heard there's an unauthorized DVD version out there that edits out that nincompoop. Let me know, I'd buy that one instead.
B00005JLT5|5.0|You think you have it hard in life ? Look at this film and it will make you appriciate every breath you take. If you are against all odds, would you give up or keep on fighting for your life ? This is what the man in the movie did. He fought and never gave up. Brilliant movie, cast, story. A real tear jerker. Get the tissues and soak it in. Adrian Brody deserved the Oscar. A MASTERPIECE INDEED
B00008H2LB|5.0|I went to my local music store today and looked around.  I was thinking, &quot;well, I have 20 bucks and I could get anything.&quot; So I looked around some more and I basically wanted something very mainstream with some hip-hop mixed in with rock.  I looked no further than the Linkin Park section.  I found Meteora and immediatly bought it.  Don't get me wrong, this is good quality mainstream, but if you hate any form of hip-hop or rap, I wouldn't buy this album because some of it is rap-rock influenced.  Anyways onto the review.<br />As soon as I popped this in my Aiwa Portable CD Player, and heard the first REAL song (not the first track), I was hooked.  The bass and guitars roar in your headphones if you have good ones and the production quality of the CD is overall polished.  The first track, Don't Stay opens with monster riffs that are so awesome that you'll be blown away if you have your volume up loud. The cool little intro to Don't Stay is nice, as it builds up higher and higher to the point where they start singing and it gets quiet, then goes on rocking away.  Nice use of lyrics and rhyming by Chester (Lead vocalist). <BR>(One thing I noticed is that Mike doesn't sing too much on this track, so all you Chester lovers, don't skip this track.)<br />As that track was over, the next track rolled on, Somewhere I belong.  As you all probably know, this is one of their &quot;radio hits, and its definately catchy, from the beginning of the scratching and the piano which in my opinion, sounds beautiful, to the harder parts in the song such as halfway into the song as Chester screams his throat out.  Nice rapping by Mike.  Kudos to Mike, again, for the scratches.<br />The track finally faded off and on came the next track, Lying From You, which is definately one of the harder songs on here.  Weird intro to the song with Mike being the DJ, then onto the killer riffs and back to the weird little sound that Mike does with his DJ equipment.  Mike's rapping in this one is reminiscent of Figure.09. Chesters screams get truly deep in this song as the track tends to get harder in guitar riffs.<br />Hit The Floor is a cool little rapish song near the beginning, then Chester kicks in and screams his heartfelt lyrics out, then kicking back to Mike's rapping and scratches.  This song reminds me of way back when in Hybrid Theory of the song Papercut.  Very fun to listen to.  Kudos to the nice DJing.<br />Easier To Run starts out very slow and soft, gradually building up to being one of the most melodic tracks on here.  If you liked Crawling and such by the way back when, you will most likely enjoy this track.  Personally, I think it's a very relaxed, and layed back track to lay back and daze off to.  Good melody here.<br />Faint is the first song I have heard from Linkin Parks new album, and it was a very good one indeed.  Nice use of the looped little violin soloish thing.  Chester's voice is especially good on this song and Mikes rapping is essential on this song.  Without it, this song would be nothing but a rock track that would be &quot;missing&quot; that special touch.  Great track overall, especially if you're just getting into Linkin Park.<br />Figure.09 was another of my favorites when I first heard it. Following right after Faint, it blends in nicely to the track transition and has a sick beat and intro riff to it.  Very catchy and melodic.  Definately a song to check out if you're into Chester more than Mike.  Good chorus, &quot;Now you've become a part of meeee.&quot; I can't get that out of my head.<br />Breaking The Habit is a boring song to me with nothing special to spark me up and say, &quot;wow that was an awesome track.&quot; I don't like the intro to it and I never did like the riffs.  Although some of it is a little catchy in the beginning, it's nowhere near good enough to be called a &quot;superb track.&quot;<br />From The Inside was a cool song with a very nice intro to the song with the riffs smashing down on the listener and then breaking into Chester's &quot;singing&quot; voice.  Mike raps along with Chester in this one and they both get their share in singing in this song.  The chorus has an exploding riff and its so catchy that I have to put this song on repeat.<br />Nobody's Listening is...well...I don't like this song.  VERY rap influenced.  Mike raps most of the time here and there is a flute in the background.  No guitars and no drumming 'till the end.  Very boring, although the beat gets me nodding my head....<br />Session is a wicked awesome instrumental and all the scratches and drumming and such is fantastic.  Mike does a good job being the DJ here and mixing things.  Very nice beat/tune overall.<br />That just leaves Numb, my ABSOLUTE favorite on this CD.  This song is EXTREMELY catchy and chances are, most people have heard it.  The intro to it is very nice, going on to the most catchy, melodic guitar riff ever!  Mikes rapping and Chesters screaming fit perfectly on this track. Kudos to the bass player for giving us some very good bass throughout this song and the whole album for that.  Do not skip over this track.<br />Even though the CD clocks in at 36:41, it's still excellent quality.  Wouldn't you rather have quality over quanity. Plus, there are NO filler tracks which is EXCELLENT.  Great CD to own if you're a Linkin Park fan or if you are just discovering them.  Now I leave buying the album up to you....
B000002A46|5.0|It is no contest that Mariah Careys Christmas album surpasses those of her counterparts (Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, ect...).  In this album, Mariah shows off her diverse vocal style and 8 oct. voice (nor Celine or Whitney have an 8 oct. voice).  She also has a knick for writting, and wrote some of her own Christmas classics instead of making an album fully on other peoples songs.  She mixes Christmas classic sounds with todays gospel choirs.  Each song is perfect in every way.

B00005V1B1|4.0|Camel is one of the few bands that is famous for being underrated. The band did not get enough airplay at its time to reach the success of fellow Yes, Genesis, or Pink Floyd, but it did not stop it from releasing great music. Mirage, along with The Snow Goose, shows the Band in great shape, but I don't think it is solid enough to get a 5 star. The music is flawless, with lots of rich instrumental passages and catchy vocal parts, but it somehow lacks the conceptual approach of, say, Thick as a Brick (from Jethro Tull) or I Robot (Alan Parsons Project). While it showcases great musicianship and composing habilities, Mirage still stays behind the Snow Goose, as the second contains a more solid storyline and richer compositions and harmonies. Anyway, Mirage is still a great record you will not regret buying.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Absotively cool! The score was amazing, the vocals were amazing, etc. etc.<br />It's a very diverse orchestrated...thing. I don't know the proper words. ^^;;;<br />ROTK has a great theme selection and has little parts where it sounds like Navajo or Oriental tunes. Very interesting that they should show up in Middle-Earth.<br />What kind of weirded me out at times was the fact that ocarinas and flutes popped up every once in a while--not that it's a bad thing, it's kind of like &quot;Whoa, what theme in LOTR uses these wind instruments?&quot; <br />I'd have to say my only complaint is the last song sung by Anne Lennox. Her voice is all right, I guess, but while the words are perfect for the journey to the Grey Havens, her tone and the accompaniment of guitar and horn really clash, and I wondered, what's up with the guitar? Or maybe it's a mandolin or some obscure stringed instrument. But its placement in this CD really threw me off there. They should have gotten Enya to sing it in Elvish or something. Without that guitar. <br />Other than that last song, this soundtrack's definitely worth it. Buy it and put it on full volume! But turn it down for track 6. It starts out pretty loud. *grin*
0385720920|5.0|First things first...It takes a long time to read Choke because the laughs slow down one's normal reading speed.  So, don't let the novel's size deceive you.  Second, this is not a frivolous book.  As is true with quality comedy, the obscured underlying \\"message\\" is deadly serious.  Ostensibly, Victor Mancini is working (Choking) in fine restaurants for the purpose of reaping financial windfalls that will enable him to purchase for his mother, Ida, a feeding tube.  In the novel, Victor recounts life with Ida, the \\"Mommy,\\" and describes himself as the \\"gullible\\" or otherwise diminished \\"kid.\\" Ida is a criminal; her crimes are petty, but intended toward one goal:  creating chaos and unpredictability in a world which, she says, suffers from a surplus of organization (everyday a \\"cruise ship\\").  She goes to a pharmacy and mixes up hair dyes, placing blonde in the red-hair box and so on.  She wants, not to uncomplicate her life, but to uncomplicate herself.  She is not alone.  Also seeking a meaning in unpredictable and seemingly trivial actions is Denny, the \\"hey dude\\" friend of Victor.  He collects rocks to celebrate his sobriety.  Victor, Ida, Denny, the nursing home \\"doctor,\\" Paige:  all are pilgrims in the new world, trying in their modern way to build Johnathan Winthrop's \\"city on a hill.\\"  Addicted to drugs, sex, delusional, these and other characters in Choke are trying to find direction and meaning in a world that  would rather avoid even such discussions.   I could not bring myself to find convincing the image of an adult Victor Mancini who remains impressionable after a volatile, unprotected childhood of trailing his wily mother in and out of courts, foster care and the modern legal system generally.   A small complaint in the overall scheme of things.  Reading Choke and you're in a cool hypnotic state, a self-contained world where you can laugh out loud as you ponder what drives the characters of Choke to their extremes and why, by the way, are we not similarly driven.

B000069AUI|5.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since they stormed onto the music scene with their debut album, Parachutes. It was an instant decision, therefore, to buy &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; the band's sophomore release, earlier this year. I've owned this album for several months now, and I actually find myself listening more and more and more to it as time goes on. For me, that kind of ever increasing appeal the sign of a truly great album.<BR>The first thing I'll note specifically about this album is that its biggest single, &quot;Clocks,&quot; gets my vote for the song of the year 2003. This tune is creatively written, masterfully performed, and kinetically infectious. There simply wasn't a comparable hit single in 2003 that bears the same level of craftsmanship as &quot;Clocks&quot; - it's a breathtaking song comprised of multiple layers of musical territory, a tune that will clearly continue to be a landmark for Coldplay throughout their career. <br />The marvelous thing about this album, however, is that &quot;Clocks&quot; is only the beginning. Every single track on A Rush of Blood to the Head is outstanding. While I wouldn't say the album is immediately accessible, it is immediately intriguing, and repeated listening breeds increasingly abundant dividends for the listener. I believe that's how Coldplay envisioned it. A Rush of Blood to the Head explores a wide range of musical territory, even within tracks, enveloping the attentive listener in the spectacle of it all. Each song is independently rewarding. Cumulatively, these tunes demonstrate Coldplay's fundamental musical intelligence in songwriting, which only gets better with the band's strong musicianship and the album's attentive production. <br />I began to write about particular tracks, but somehow my editorial words don't seem to do justice to these songs. Instead I'm going to leave it to you to listen and discover for yourself the plentiful (and I mean plentiful) treasures on this album. <br />I will say that in my opinion, A Rush of Blood to the Head is THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR 2003. Music simply doesn't get any better. This is a FANTASTIC ALBUM.
B00004Z459|4.0|Welcome to a cd filled with anger, sadness, and confusion. This cd gives new meaning to the genre soft rock, that being its not all bad. The singers scream or rap their way through a 12 track cd, targeting mostly angry teens. Just when you think one song is different, because the lead is quietly singing his way through emotional lyrics and a quiet guitar, it all jumps back to the angry, soft metal. The pros are that you get a mix of rap and metal, so most teens will be satisfied. The cons are only 12 songs.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This was easily one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life. Although it is hard to explain why it was good or even what the story was about, it is a movie that really makes you think.
0679746048|5.0|I loved the movie thanks to Angelina Jolie. I got the book much later. The book is even more honest.Lisa you love her as if you were Susanna. She is funny, honest and real.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I just cannot understand what all the hype is about this album.  I bought it looking for something new to listen to.  True, I grew up listening to the hair bands and rock and roll bands of the 70's and 80's, but I feel I can listen to most &quot;music&quot; out there.  This was absolute trash.  This is absolutely the first time I've ever bought an album and literally threw it away after the first time through.  Sometimes music will grow on me, but I hope that this band never does or I'll have it surgically removed!!!  Don't waste your money.  Go buy something from Incubus instead.  Now there is some real talent.
B000089CJI|4.0|I've always found the little Death Cab For Cutie I've heard a bit too dry and never really heard any Dntel, but &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; lured me into this side-project of the two. While Ben Gibbard's lyrics occasionally do seem weak and towards the end of the album Tamborello's beats get a bit too dark to work, for the most part this is a solid album that manages to balance 80's styled synth pop (in particular &quot;nothing better&quot; seems like an homage to Human League's &quot;Don't You Want Me&quot;) with just enough minimalist glitch to keep things sounding modern.
0385508417|5.0|I never knew Grisham could write a heart warming / funny story. Job well done! Its about a man who wants to skip cristmas go on vacation and forget all the whoopla and trouble that comes with the holidays. can he suceed ? you'll see.

B0000E1WKE|1.0|This album is horrible.  Why her voice is still beautiful the vocal arrangements are horrid...like she hit the crack pipe before she went into the studio.  This is a lazy effort with too few songs and two recycled songs from the Preacher's Wife.  She needs to hire a decent producer.
B0000640VO|5.0|best french film I have seen. You fall for Amelie. So cute and Quirky. Very funny film. Makes you want to move to France.
B000005Z0G|3.0|Album is good. but the lyrics r different from his other albums. I was looking for a CD like THUG LIFE but kind of dissapointed.<br />Some song r very good and worth mentioning like:<BR>Strickly 4 my N.I.G.G.A.Z<BR>Papa'z song<BR>Last wordz<BR>Holler ya' if u hear me<br />Others r very different and his voice is kinda craking down there.<br />Burn it. Dont buy if u r looking for old tupac. <BR>This is my first time saying to burn a 2PAC album but it's true......  :(
B00008BXJF|1.0|I've always amazed why people give 5 stars for everything on Amazon! I'm not reading 5 stars reviews anymore, because usually they are not fair enough.<BR>Five stars for this album??? Give me a brake! How about KC debut, Lizard or Red then? Should they get 20 stars at least in comparison with this 5 stars \\"masterpiece\\"?<BR>In my opinion, 5 star means \\"excellent\\". Is this excellent?<BR>People give 5 stars just because there is the proud King Crimson name on the sleeve. Deep down, guys, and tell me how would you have rated this, if this album had been issued by an unknown band? <BR>This miserable album lacks of good melodies and inventive playing. Pop, nu-metal, stupid electronic voice effects. Cul-de-sac...<BR>So, my suggestion: save your money for something better. Naturally, if you are KC die-hard fan, then buy this, because this album was made (unfortunately!) by the band called King Crimson.
B00000GAIW|3.0|I did not buy this album for myself but to please my boifriend.  <BR>It is one of those bands with who I have a &quot;love-hate&quot; relationship (same with Bob Dylan and Neil Young).  No middle, I really love the song or really hate it.  Why is that?  Because I cannot stand folk.  I have to admit that they make really good music but having a tendancy to abuse a bit on the flute.  Songs I really like: Aqualung - Cross eyed Mary - My god - Hymn 43 - Locomotive Breath - Bouree.  On the counterpart, I just go insane when I hear Mother goose - Wond'ring aloud - Up to me - Slipstream - and worst of the worst : beginning of Wind up.<br />Can't love them all
B00007E8V4|4.0|Well.... I would say that this album is their best. No way this album sucks! <BR>Toxity was good, heavy and worth listening but this album is way toooooo good! <BR>Chicken and stu' is a very good opening and a very very funny song. <BR>Buy this album! One more thing, this album is still in my CD player along with other albums.
0679428895|4.0|from author Richard Harris.  Harris has previously written three novels of historical fiction, set in WWII, and postwar.  This time he's far more ambitious with his setting, returning to the Roman Empire of A.D. 79.  Too few works about ancient Rome focus on the amazing engineering feats achieved by the empire; most focus on the battles, the slaves and gladiators, the cracks in the armor that eventually led to the fall of the Empire.  Harris centers his work on the wonder of the Roman water system, dependent on a series of magnificent aqueducts that supported the needs of the people, and were truly a mark of engineering genius.<br />Harris' first novel, \\"Fatherland\\" always stands out for me in the amazing niche it filled - a novel of historical fiction that attempted to answer the question -- what would have happened if Hitler won the war?  Although new novelist Harris was unable to bring his talents and imagination for setting and conflict to his characterization of the main characters, it was forgiveable in light of the stunning impact of his work.  His following two historical novels, \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Archangel\\" were interesting, but mere shadows of his promise from \\"Fatherland\\".<br />Here, now, many years later, Harris brings us in with the tale too often ignored in our historical view -- the incredible eruption of the volcano Vesuvius that destroyed the Roman city of Pompeii.  In his hero, Marcus Attilus Primus, an engineer newly assigned to the Aqua Augusta in the days before the eruption, Harris has created a character complex and equal to the tale and the impressive research he did and shares with us about the aqueduct, the times, and the eruption.  It is a tale that draws you in and won't let you go.  Flawed by lack of appropriate motive and characterization of the supporting roles, Pompeii is nevertheless a delicious read of historical nonfiction.<br />You'll enjoy!
B000084T18|4.0|This was a good mainstream debut for 50 cent even though it was not really a debut album. The beats on this album are great and I don't know why people are having so much trouble figuring out what he is saying. Sometimes he mumbles not on every song. Like on P.I.M.P. it is easy to hear what he is saying. The lyrics are pretty simple but not that bad. They are not as bad as some people say they are but he is not the incredible lyricist he says he his. I like he laid back style of rapping. Most rappers are caught up in getting lighting quick rhymes like Twista but 50 cent never rushes. He should stop this beef with Ja Rule. He is such a hipocrit. I mean he says Ja is stealing Pac's work when he uses a whole verse of Pac's Hail Mary on Hail Mary 2003. They should just go on about their lives. Now back to the album. The best songs on the album are Many Men, If I Can't, Don't Push Me, P.I.M.P. and 21 questions. He is not the next Pac and you should not be waiting for him to put out a classic rap album but this is good mainstream hip hop and you should enjoy listening to this album. Go pick this up.
B000089CJI|4.0|No matter what song you're looking for on a file-sharing network, \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" shows up in your search results and no one seems to know who performed it. I've seen guesses ranging from Duran Duran (warm) to Depeche Mode (getting colder) to The Clash (freezing). It's certainly not The Postal Service, because they're a new band, although their singer sounds an awful lot like the singer for The Buggles, the band credited for the first video ever played on MTV.<br />Despite the singer's uncanny similarity to an `80s novelty band's and a synthesizer foundation, The Postal Service are not exactly on a New Wave nostalgia trip. The duo consists of Ben Gibbard, singer for earnest indie rockers Death Cab For Cutie, and techno artist Jimmy Tamborello, who releases records as Dntel. Gibbard provided vocals for Dntel's amazing 2001 single, \\"(This Is) The Dream Of Evan and Chan,\\" and the pair collaborated on Give Up by exchanging tapes through the mail. (Get it? The Postal Service?)<br />While none of the songs on Give Up match the brilliance of their first collaboration, there are certainly great moments to be found throughout this full-length release (especially the moment when the glitchy beat that underpins album opener \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" suddenly picks up and starts propelling itself forward).<br />Gibbard's lyrics and vocals are just as earnest and sincere as those he provides for his full-time gig but, for me, they work a lot better with dense, almost danceable beats swirling around them than with dull, ten-years-out-of-date guitar drones dragging along behind them. It's not that his lyrics are bad - because they're actually quite good - but sometimes they're so romantic and hopeful that they're almost embarassing, so it helps to have such detailed production to distract the listener into hearing only the melodies, which will stick in your head after the first listen.<br />For example, on \\"Sleeping In,\\" which opens with an awkward reference to the \\"mystery of who shot John F. Kennedy,\\" Tamborello keeps the listener distracted with a shuddering beat and plonky keyboard melody while Gibbard describes his dream of a world in which \\"people thought they were just being rewarded/For treating others as they'd like to be treated/For obeying stop signs and curing diseases.\\" It's totally corny, but it works.<br />The album's best song is \\"Such Great Heights,\\" which begins with a twitchy, headphone-worthy beeping pattern, and then the bassline fades in and the beat begins just ahead of Gibbard's vocals, and the whole effort just comes together so transcendantly that it sounds almost effortless. In a perfect world, this insanely catchy song should have been on the radio all summer, but it's not a perfect world, so you'll just have to buy the album and find out what you were missing.
B0000942HV|1.0|After ordering the CD (but before receiving it) I have found out that this is one of those carrying CSD (Copy protection). I haven't even gotten this yet but the minute I do, I will probably just send it back unopened for a refund. I am not a supporter of copy protection and have also had problems with other protected discs in numerous equipment. In fact owning and iPod and always on the go, everything I buy gets loaded into my iBook or iMac and sync'd to my iPod. <br />I guess my biggest gripe is that the recording industry assumes that anyone trying to import a CD into MP3 format is out to break the 'law' by music sharing... I wonder if sharing my music by letting my friends listen to my iPod and showing them where they can buy a CD for their own is also illeagal....

It reads NOTHING like the original; the beauty and simplicity of the reading has been replaced by something that seems written for a first grade reader. (Maybe its more readable for first graders, but not for those who care about words...).<br />I actually went home and read my original to make sure I wasn't imagining the difference (maybe it wasn't as good as I remembered!)<br />Caveat Emptor!!<br />BFM
0385504209|3.0|Brown is only the latest of a number of popular fiction writers who have mined the legends of the grail and Knights Templar for plot ideas. What distinguishes this book is the promise- never fully realized- of the revelation of a great secret (and great improprieties) hidden by the modern-day Roman Church. Perhaps part of the interest is rooted in the current scandals of a different nature involving the Church.<br />While Brown starts strongly enough- a murder in the Lourve, a hidden secrets, a visitng American academic suddenly caught up in a vast centuries-old conspiracy- the book soon becomes little more than a so-so detective novel with all the usual gambits and tricks. Yes, there's a fair bit of facinating grail lore mixed in, but it's been done better by others.<br />This is not a bad book; it's good vacation or airplane reading, and for the first half you'll find yourself caught up in the story and facinated by the bits of the legend that Brown doles out in drips and drabs. But then the plot sort of slows down and the suprises become fewer as the turns and twists become more obvious. The climax of the mystery is pretty unsatisfying, the characters are never fleshed out much, and by the end of the book you don't care much one way or another what becomes of them.<br />If you're looking for a really masterful, brilliantly written book built on the Templar legend, you can't do better than Umberto Eco's &quot;Focault's Pendulum&quot;. If you're interested in some more fanciful and full of conspiracies there's always the books of Robert Anton Wilson.
B000002UB3|5.0|All I can say is that not only is this the best work the Beatles ever produced, it is probably the best album of all time. Absolute perfection. I'm not even going to go into a detailed review of this one - it would take me a billion words to describe what it means to me. This album proves perfection can, or at least has, been achieved.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This is THE album of 2003. For the rock-minded, the best pop music of the year was made by &quot;new&quot; bands like Kings Of Leon or The Rapture, but they are not seeing the entire picture. For the hip-hop minded, this record maybe sound old-fashioned, and they're right in a way: Alicia Keys pays tribute to Gladys Knight covering the classic Motown ballad IF I WERE YOUR WOMAN (Alicia's version is beautiful) and you can hear references to 70's soul throughout the record, but there's some REAL SONGS here, something that is missing on 90% of the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop albums these days. Alicia sings her heart out on this CD without relying on vocal acrobatics or mannerisms. She's a gifted singer and musician, with an excelent taste for arrangements and songs. And believe me, there is not a song on this album you can call a &quot;filler&quot;, this is beautiful from start to finish. This is SOUL MUSIC folks, with capital letters. I truly believe this is the best Soul album of the last ten years. It will be a classic? Only time will tell, but I'm sure I will listen to this CD over and over for the years to come.
0385335482|1.0|This book is a perfect example why financial journalists' should stick to numbers.  Did the author not consider seeking the advice of a literary advisor?  The character's are underdeveloped and boring.  And the plot?  Just add water and you have the identical plot of any other 'chicklit' out today.  Will she find love?  Will she save money?  Oh gosh, I'm so concerned!  Will she survive without her &quot;pot's of moisturizer&quot;?  Unimaginative and shallow to say the least.  Take some advise along with the main character, save your money by not purchasing this book.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|Does it matter that the effects are dated? Does it matter when the music is this good? No, of course not! The main thing is seeing these songs in a live(ish) context. The visuals are lovely if you discard the special effects. Hey it was the 70s - don't expect anything wildly new. If you didn't buy it for the music you didn't buy it at all.<br />There are some snippets of interviews with the band and the making of Dark Side of The Moon. You can practically forget the interviews - they're not something special. While Dave and Nick talk more about the music and being &quot; slaves to technology &quot; in the past with the music, Roger is on more of a political frame of mind ( surprise surprise ). A bit surpising that Richard wasn't asked for his opinion on things ( seems like a little flavour of things to come doesn't it? ). The making of Dark Side is a little interesting - some nice touches and an early glimpse of those Synthi AKS synthesizers or as Richard H Kirk of Cabaret Voltaire once said that they looked like &quot; suitcases.&quot; <br />You really have to have this is your collection if you are a fan of Pink Floyd - no two ways about it
B000092ZYX|1.0|waste of time and money. Buy it only if you are brainless.
B000002U8G|5.0|It does sound like that though doesn't it? You got to love to this album. From the echoed bass opening of One Of These Days to the 23 minute bonanza of Echoes ( is there some sort of concept I'm missing here?) the album is about as flawless as flawless can be. This has the rip roaring Echoes with the distorted voice telling you &quot; One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces &quot; which was about all the equipment they had at the time because it wasn't working. Novel idea for song that isn't it?<br />A Pillow of Winds is a really romantic song from Waters - quite surprising given his later turns into a ranting socialite who's always angry with the government. Fearless is a great song that has the Liverpool fans ( this is soccer mind you ) chanting &quot; You'll Never Walk Alone &quot; which is beautiful....almost brings a tear to my eye ( well I am a Liverpool supporter you know ). San Tropez is probably the only song that still kinda holds onto the spirit of Syd a little with its quirky little rhymes. And Seamus ( &quot; that's the dog &quot; ) is just a bluesy song with a dog in the background. I wonder if this is the same dog that got used in the Animals album.....ah well<br />And now for Echoes! Some people look at it as a 3-4 minute song stretched out to over 23 minutes. Nonsense! Well yeah I suppose they do have a point but the amount of detours we get along the way is nothing less than fascinating. The musicianship is fascinating and I do like those birds/dolphins in the middle ( whichever it is ). A fantastic &quot;epic&quot; that really does wonders. Funny thing was when I heard this on my uncle's vinyl I was so impressed by this. Even when it was supposedly skipping it still sounded good ( I hardly knew that it was skipping ( is that a sign of a good record?)). Also when this was going through the demo pile, it was originally called &quot; The Return of The Son of Nothing.&quot; I don't know about you but that's an equally good name for the song too<br />If you want my advice - I'd tell you to get this first. Nevermind The Wall, nevermind Dark Side of The Moon. Get this first. It has all the makings of a masterpiece but it doesn't because it didn't sell as many as those mentioned above. Bloody shame - some people don't know what they're missing!
B00009V7T2|5.0|Raving over this release 6 months into its life cycle may seem a very easy thing to do but I think my story of obtaining this album may provide a guideline for anyone else thinking of purchasing this. The only current bands I appreciated at the time were Radiohead and Opeth and it was a recommendation from Opeth singer Mikeal Akerfeldt that lead to me purchasing this album. OK this is really sounding long winded but I feel I owe an explanation as after owning this beauty for a month I can now proclaim it my favourite album ever. It has everything a person could look for in intelligent rock music, the instrumentation is fantastic, lyrics thought provoking, production suitable and the songwriting is tripped out without ever betraying the song. The hype seems to be of Rodriguez and Zavala being the new Page and Plant, at first I scoffed at this but I don't know they seem to hold that kind of aura at least at the moment. In buying this album be aware that it is very much a love it or hate it affair, the high vocals, effects laden guitars, university lyrical musings and pretentious song titles turn as many people off as it does on. I have heard this album described as offensive and a disgrace to music but also among people I know I have never heard an album proclaimed as &quot;the best ever&quot; by so many people since OK Computer. Don't be like me and wait 3 months to get this album because you think so much new music is bad, come down off the fence I promise this album will invoke a response one way or another.
0385504209|3.0|So, a few years ago Dan Brown wrote a book called &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; which was the first appearance of our intelligent superhero Robert Langdon. In short, that book talked about a conspiracy related to Vatican, art history, a mysterious organization, and fast-paced action.<br />The thing about &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is that it is an almost exact copy of Brown's previous book. A young, attractive and intelligent girl who's father has been murdered and who helps our beloved protagonist. A mind-boggling conspiracy spanning several centuries and involving some of the brightest minds of our history. A disarming and, let's face it, interesting array of facts and trivia about art, history, symbology and life in general. If you take all of these pieces and put them together the result should be a satisfying thriller, but despite being thrilled and  excited throughout the whole ride, neither of Brown's books can be called satisfying when you finally close the book.<br />To me both of these books are like parts of a James Bond-like series. A series that is meant to be more intelligent than the adventures of double-0-seven, but as action packed and as filled with themes of world domination/destruction. Brown manages to pull the more intelligent part off nicely but his characters are not 3D enough for us to care and his storylines are too twisty to feel real. And believe me when I tell you that Brown's talent as a writer isn't helping much.<br />All in all this book is an entertaining read but the right course of obtaining this would be borrowing from a friend.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|This, my friends, is a good case for MP3 ripping. Like a fool, I bought this CD on the virtue of the first song. The first song is pretty good. The rest of this CD is crap. Here are the apparent 3 simple steps to writing DT songs:<br />1. Come up with a riff. Anything hashed over from the 80's, or earlier DT albums will do. It's not like it matters when we get to step 2 anyway.<br />2. Play it ad nauseum. First loud, then soft. Then fast, then slow. Skip a beat here and there. Pause. Mike, hit the tiny splash cymbal. No go! Play real fast! Louder! Louder! Go go go! Stop! James, say something stupid like &quot;Cross the crooked stair&quot;. Go! Go! Go! Okay, now overdub some conversations going on in the background. Stop. Drum solo. Go! Stop. End on a big note.<br />3. Solo over it. First guitar, then keyboard. As long as the guitar plays as fast as possible, and the keyboard player uses a patch that sounds like a cat getting smashed under a garage door, it should be about right. <br />I'm a patient man, but listening to this album makes me want to tear my hair out. This album sucks.
B000002UJQ|5.0|1. Airbag (4.0) - A beautiful opener; drags on a bit with its grinding/squealing guitar toward the end. Besides, this song is always listened to in anticipation of...<br />2. Paranoid Android (5) - The definitive song of our generation. Juxtapositions several forms of musical expression into a lean six-ish minutes that end far too soon. The guitar here is paced perfectly, and the abstract lyrics create the most uneasy mood.<br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien (3.5) - The first truly wistful song on the album. Thom actually sings about a specific desire - to re-examine the world as an alien.<br />4. Exit Music (For a Film) (2.5) - In my opinion, the album's only weak spot. I love the mantra (&quot;We hope that you choke&quot;) that has become the central lyric of Radiohead fandom, but the song just lacks a drving rhythm.<br />5. Let Down (5) - The only point of the album that lets you out of your manic state long enough to shed a tear. Being trapped and meaningless (&quot;One day, I am going to grow wings/A chemical reaction/Hysterical and useless&quot;) drives this lovely, wistful song. Thom's layered vocals over the final verse will claw at you.<br />6. Karma Police (4.5) - For some reason, this song never affected me much until I saw the video. A very haunting song, punctuated by an excellent closing chant (&quot;Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself...&quot;) that shows Radiohead's ability to trun simplicity into a maddening, complicated mess.<br />7. Fitter Happier (4.5) - Very enjoyable. Just a spoken-word dictation of how life should be and the psychological consequences behind it.<br />8. Electioneering (4) - I guess this is their power-pop contribution. It's clear-cut what this song is about, and it's presented well, especially the simple chorus.<br />9. Climbing Up the Walls (5) - I could write an essay on this song. It's very creepy; details the dehumanization of man via computers and the government. I'll keep it brief: a chilling drumline and Thom's distorted voice tie this song with paranoid Android as the band's most interesting and best-presented songs.<br />10. No Surprises (5) - The song that made me a Radiohead fan. It's utterly beautiful; probably their most calming and aesthetically pleasing. A great contrast to the disturbing lyrics (&quot;You look so tirednhappy (sic)/Bring down the government...I'll take the quiet life/A handshake of carbon monoxide&quot;).<br />11. Lucky (4.5) - Could easily be a Pink Floyd song. This one is very drawn-out and beautiful.<br />12. The Tourist (3) - Nothing particularly earth-shattering here. Perhaps I call it a 3 compared to the rest of the album.
B00005JMTQ|4.0|SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE brings to recollection the short novel by Jeanne Ray of a couple of years back, JULIE AND ROMEO, which reminded us that women (and men) of &quot;that certain age&quot;, and not just the insufferably young and impossibly beautiful, enjoy and cherish sex.<br />Jack Nicholson, in perhaps his best role in awhile playing ... well, playing essentially Jack ... is Harry Sanborn, a 63-year old record company executive that dates and beds only women under 30. Harry's Lust of the Moment is for Marin Barry (Amanda Peet), who invites her Lothario out to her mother's (presumably unoccupied) beach house in the Hamptons for some hanky-panky. In the midst of the foreplay, however, Mom (Diane Keaton as Erica Barry) shows up with her sister Zoe (Frances McDormand). After an initial period of tension, which includes a threatened call to the police and the brandishing of a butcher knife, all decide, being adults after all, to spend the weekend under the same roof. Sanborn subsequently has a heart attack. On release from the hospital, Marin goes back to New York and Harry is left to recuperate alone at Erica's home with its 56-year old owner, a noted playwright who's trying desperately to concentrate on writing her next script. A love-hate relationship develops, and the fun begins.<br />Some of the biggest laughs hinge on nudity. A couple of times, the audience sees Harry's bare butt through the back of a hospital gown, and it's not a pretty sight. On the other hand, Erica has a full-frontal nude shot so brief that, if you blink at the wrong instant, you may miss it. However, if you rent the film when it comes out on DVD and pause it at the right instant, I suggest you'll see that Diane Keaton is still Lookin' Mighty Good. I was impressed. Harry is stunned, but not like you'd think.<br />SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is an enormously engaging romantic comedy as two veteran pros go through their paces. It's biggest flaw is that, at over two hours run time, it's too long by 30-40 minutes and one cardiac episode. (There should be a law prohibiting examples of the genre more than 90 minutes in length.) Moreover, there's an amusing but completely superfluous sidebar involving Harry's 36-year old physician (Keanu Reeves), who falls for an older woman. Guess who? On the other hand, Frances McDormand hasn't enough screen time. (To be perfectly honest, I wish she'd been cast in Keaton's part. Frances is, I think, a much better actress and could have given Erica depth beyond Diane's ability.)<br />SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE is effervescent entertainment for the 2003 holiday season. It's not likely to be nominated for any Oscars, but it's great fun and likely to boost Viagra sales. Go see it with Granny and Grandpa.y 30-40 minutes and one cardiac episode.

B000002U9E|5.0|Anyone who doesn't recognize Hounds of Love as a masterpiece just doesn't get it. Go back and really listen to it at least ten times, play loud from beginning to end. If you still don't get it, check your pulse or seek some professional psychological help.<br />Hounds Of Love was a huge influence on Prince at the time, when he made Parade, Sign Of The Times and Lovesexy. Many other musicians have declared themselves Kate Bush fans, like recently Outkast and perhaps surprising to some Johnny 'Rotten' Lydon - who by the way hates Tori Amos or Torrid Aimless as he calls her. Indeed, and if you want new agey elves &amp; fairies music, go buy an Enya CD instead.<br />Some pointers that might help you get it. The whole album is about Love and Life. Big words, I know, but Kate Bush always manages to find the perfect balance between complexity and simplicity. Running Up That Hill is about a love between man and woman, Hounds Of Love is about fear of love/embracing life, Mother Stands For Comfort is about her mother (did Kate have a bit of a strained relationship with her mother?) and Cloudbusting is about her father (with whom she is very close). I always read The Big Sky as being about her brothers, growing up with them, something like that.<br />Picking the B-side apart as if they are seperate songs doesn't make much sense. The Ninth Wave is a story - nothing confusing about it! - about a girl drowning (Under Ice), her struggle against death/out-of-body experience (Waking the Witch/Watching You Without Me), will to live (Jig of Life), nightly rescue (Hello Earth) and new appreciation of life waking up in the morning (Morning Fog):<br />I'll tell my mother,<BR>I'll tell my father,<BR>I'll tell my loved one,<BR>I'll tell my brothers<BR>How much I love them<br />Of course Hounds Of Love is not as neatly literal as the basic arch sketched here. It transcends it with rich imagery and symbolism and music that sounded like nothing else around when it first came out and imho still sounds totally fresh today.<br />Claiming that Lionheart is better is utter nonsense. Kate Bush herself has said in interviews she wasn't happy with it. Record companies preferred their artists to release a record every year. Lionheart was put together from leftovers of the Kick Inside. After Lionheart Kate Bush decided from then on she would take her time and only release albums when they're ready.<br />...rumors are the new album is almost ready and to be released in 2004.
6305508550|5.0|Mike Judge's &quot;Office Space&quot; is a sharp, satirical film comedy, which takes dead aim at white collar, corporate life and hits the bull's eye.The film is about a young guy named Peter (Ron Livingston), who works in a soulless, high-tech, corporation. He hates everything about his pencil pushing, paper shuffling, numbers crunching job and feels trapped. He hates it so much, that he goes to a 'Occupational Hypnotist' for therapy. But through a tragically, bizarre (and darkly funny) accident he gets a hypnotic suggestion in his brain to no longer give a dam about his job or financial security.With his new found attitude, he basically turns his office upside down.(I love the scene where he guts a fish on his desk!) Along the way, Peter and a pair of frustrated downsized, software engineers (David Herman &amp; Ajay Naidu), conspire to release a computer virus, that will slowly defraud the company of huge sums of money.Unfortunately something goes horribly wrong with the program and the guys must figure out a way to keep the corporate bosses from discovering their crime.When this movie was originally released in 1999 it bombed and quickly left the theatres. But through DVD/video sales &amp; rentals, constant airings on cable television and good 'word of mouth', it became a cult film with a following. I think the reason this comedy resonates within people is because it gets all the details of corporate life... so right. Director-Writer, Mike Judge (Creator of both &quot;Beavis &amp; Butthead&quot; and &quot;King of the Hill&quot;) includes everything from the well manicured but dull corporate parks to the mind numbing fluorescent lighting and the earth toned, cage-like cubicals, that you would love to bang your head against.Judge gives us all the characters you almost always find in the corporate hierarchy including the inhuman boss, the evil consultants,the penny-pinching bean counters, the gossips, the worriers, even the engineers, who think they know everything. This movie totally gets it's topic of 'office hell' and just runs with it! The cast is great all around. Standouts include Gary Cole as Lumbergh,the passive-aggresive, boss you'd love to kill and Stephen Root as Milton, a mumbling, put upon employee with a stapler obsession. Even Jennifer Aniston gives a good performance as a flair-impaired, waitress, who hates her job in a 'Fridays' style restaurant.If you work in an office, you will either laugh or cringe... or do both, while you watch this gut-busting, hilarious movie. Highly recommended!This movie totally gets it's topic of 'office hell' and just runs with it! The cast is great all around.

The movie touches on subjects in a real way...the teen movies of today have not been at the same level as The Breakfast Club.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson plays the part of William Wallace, a Scotsman who lived in the late 13th and early 14th century.  As a youngster he becomes an orphan after his father is murdered by the English.  His uncle takes him in and away to be educated and taught the skills he will need when he reaches manhood.  He returns to his home and wants to live a peaceful life but once again is terrorized by the English.  He marries but his wife is murdered by the English, who control Scotland and can force their will upon her.  Wallace is now filled with rage, kills the men responsible for murdering his beloved and recruits many other Scotsman in an effort to free themselves of the English.  Edward I (Longshanks, played by Patrick McGoohan) is determined to squash this uprising.  Many intense battle scenes and riveting drama.  Wallace is driven by rage and rightfully so, his Scottish countrymen rally behind him.  A man of courage and determination to free Scotland of their English oppressors.
0385504209|4.0|Just when I needed a diversion from the cold that grabbed me late last week a copy of The Da Vinci Code arrived!<br />This is not a great book, as has been observed by others critical of Mr. Brown's efforts.  I found it an engaging book nonetheless and remained absorbed for the last few days.  Thank you Mr. Brown.<br />To appreciate this book one must have a modicum of interest in history of the Christian church and at least a willingness to entertain some of the conspiracy theories that have spun around it over the millenia.  Personally, I'm open to the argument that the feminine has been given short shrift by the church and found Mr. Brown's presentation of the history entertaining.  When I visited Glastonbury some years ago, I was quite taken by the Arthurian connections and the link to early Christianity represented by the hawthorne tree ostensibly sprouting from a staff planted in the ground by Joseph of Aramethia.  Myth is lovely and a healthy antidote, in my estimation, to our overly analytical and materially oriented culture.  This book was a &quot;good read.&quot;  But with my sinuses clearer now and my attention a bit keener, I'll likely turn to richer faire as my reading continues.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie enough.  The plot is about a utopian society, similar to the novels Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and 1984, (forget authors name).  This is a great movie, for me, especially, since I've read brave new world, and wished there was a movie about it, or similar, that did it justice.  This movie is perfect.  The suspense is very tense, and the drama also.  The actors do a great job in the movie, and everything gives you the feeling of a unfeeling society.  The plot is great, the suspense and action just keeps building up as the story goes along, the main character is at first very stern, and uncompassionate, but as he slowly realizes how wrong everything is, he becomes admirable. Instead of just all of a sudden going against the government, he slowly starts doing things differently, and this makes it more believable.   Usually when i go see movies, i yell at the main character to do something when something goes wrong, in this movie, he always does what you want him too.  Everytime a action scene comes up, its incredibly exciting, me and my brother were shouting cause we loved it so much.  It's a great action movie, a great suspense movie, and a great drama movie, and a great sci fi movie, all in one.  It's, in my opinion, the best movie out right now.  When i read on the cover &quot;better than the matrix&quot; i didnt believe it, but it really is.  It's as thought provoking, maybe even more so, than the matrix, and it doesn't need slow mo bullets and incredible special effects (although the effects are great, especially the city design, and the pale blue atmosphere of the movie)Oh, and for all you slamming it for the &quot;dog scene&quot;.. that scene adds to the drama, because it may seem silly him being that attached to a dog, but that is because he was never attached to ANYTHING, and the dog appeals to him, and stands for much more than just a dog in that scene.  Any critic who slams this movie is an idiot.  This movie made me appreciate reality a lot more.
B000092ZYX|1.0|This cd sucks bad. its horrible. slow and steady dosent win the race hear. it sounds like one huge long song. the music videos are really bad. i think this could win one of the worst bands alive award. that or ok computer. be free to e-mail me if u wont to argue about it.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Its a great christmas album I love Whitney Houston One wish holiday album. It have alot of christmas tune to fill everyone house with joy!
B00008H2LB|3.0|I have to admit a few songs are a bit catchy like Numb and Dont Stay but overall its not that good of an album. I know everyone likes them just to try to be like a &quot;rebel&quot; but i mean come on. I admit i used to love Hybrid Theory and its a good album. This is average rap-metal. Buy HT instead.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|There are no words to describe how amazing Whitney Houston first ever Christmas album is... &quot;One Wish&quot; is one of the best christmas album out clear...Everyone heard the great reviews about &quot;One Wish&quot; and believe me its true and then some. The first song on &quot;One Wish&quot;...&quot;The First Noel&quot; is great, Whitney goes to church on this song. Her vocals was awesome and everything seem to just come together on this album...I think its definately the best Christmas album out this year...The Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; is the must have christmas cd for the seaon. Its the type of cd that will keep your guess entertain and memorize! You just can't go wrong with Whitney Houston she's the diva that shows other diva how it should be done when it comes to singing! &quot;One Wish&quot; is five stars all the way baby! Get it today if you dont have it already!
B0000942LT|4.0|How many bands have we seen that go on repeating the same stuff again and again.if a bands has a successful album, you are sure to find the same formula again in their next album.but STAIND are not that kind of a band.<BR>           The album is nothing like &quot;Break the cycle&quot;.for a start it is much softer.but this is not a bad point.the album is really good.it showcases frontman aaron lewis's vocal ability and also lyrical ability.the guitar parts are very good(this is a distict ability exclusive to staind.even in a slow song like &quot;zoe jane&quot;,they have a heavy riff for the chorus).the drumming is also good except in the track &quot;reality&quot;(it feels like the drummer forgot what he has to play).<BR>          Truly speeking this album is great.but if your expecting it to be as good as &quot;break the cycle&quot; then i can't make any promises.&quot;price to play&quot;,&quot;so far away&quot;,&quot;zoe jane&quot;,&quot;fill me up&quot; and &quot;falling down&quot; are the best tracks in the album.<BR>          Even if the album is not as heavy as its predecessor,it's difference from it is remarkable and the courage of the band to go out of the way and make a totally different album is worth appreciating.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Anyone under the impression that Whitney Houston was washed up and over with needs to hear this album. It is a true testament of why she is one of the most influential R&amp;B singers of our time. This album ranks up there with Boyz II Men's &quot;Christmas Interpretations&quot; and Mariah Carey's &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; albums. Whitney didn't just pick the typical &quot;poppy&quot; Christmas songs to record, she also chose the traditional songs. Such as &quot;The First Noel,&quot; &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot; and &quot;Cantique de Nvel (Oh Holy Night).&quot; One of my favorites has to be the stirring rendition of &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot; that sounds like the group Take 6 was backing her up. The single released from the album &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; may be misleading to some because she's not singing at her full register, but the other songs on the album find her belting out the notes like the Whitney Houston we're used to. She even gets a little bit of help from daughter Bobbi Christina on &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; and surprisingly the little girl doesn't sound half bad. Whitney then takes you to church at the end of the CD with &quot;Joy To The World.&quot; I got goosebumps when I first heard it. This is one of those albums that will go down as a classic, and if you're a collector of holiday music this is one that HAS to become a part of your collection. It sure has for me, and will be one of the only Christmas albums I'll be listening to this season.
B00008MLSH|4.0|As noted in my review on OperaOnline.us, I thought this album was superb. I wrote: &quot;This is one of those rare recordings where not a single title is wasted or out of mood or context with the preceding. Netrebko is an exciting soprano whose voice can fill a room and soothe the proverbial savage beast. She is a pleasure to listen to. Her voice oozes youthful energy and passion, while at the same time never being shrill or uneven. Imagine a roller coaster ride on a cushion of air, and that's the journey you take when listening to Anna Netrebko.&quot;
6305537798|3.0|Joseph Gordon Levitt(HalloweenH2), Tv's 3rd Rock From The Sun) is in love with Julia Stiles little sister, Julia Stiles(A Guy Thing, The Bourne Identity2002) and her sister cant date or do anything unless their father, a very hilarious Larry Miller(Best In Show, Carnival Of Souls), says so. so Levitt meets David Krumholtz(The Mexican, Santa Clause 1 and 2) and he tells him about this rebel kid, played perfectly by Heath Ledger(The Order, The Patriot), so Levitt makes a deal with Ledger and Ledger puts the charm on Stiles and Levitt puts his charm on Stiles' sister. witty and funny with good performances by the young hot cast. other cast members include Andrew Keegan(O, Camp Nowhere), Alyson Jenney(Tv's The West Wing), Gabrielle Union(Bring It On, Deliver Us From Eva) and  Daryl &quot;Chill&quot; Mitchell(Tv's ED and Sgt.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon's work. Loved Buffy and found Angel to be good as well, with a miss here and there. <br />That said, I believe that had Firefly been allowed to continue, it would have eclipsed both of those shows, in terms of both quality and fandom. And that's saying quite a bit.<br />The writing was top notch, the actors were perfectly cast and in 13 episodes of an all too short season many people came to care about and take an interest in these characters. They had texture and depth. In othere words, they had a real-ness too them that is seldom seen in fictional TV.<br />For those that have watched this DVD and listened to the episode commentaries, I thnk you'll agree with me when I say that I hope this set sells very, very well and leads to a series resurrection. Then Joss can push that big red button.<br />Meanwhile, I think I'll be in muh bunk. ;-)
B0000524CY|5.0|Thirty years later and I still find &quot;The Exorcist&quot; a powerful, disturbing, and amazing work of art.  William Friedkin's direction is superb, the score including Oldfield's TUBULAR BELLS still one of the best, and the whole project an exercise in terror.  Let's go beyond the obvious special effects and the frightening possession of Regan McNeil, and look at the stunning performances Friedkin elicited.<br />Ellen Burstyn is outstanding; her mother role goes from the pampered movie star trying to stay close to her daughter to the pure terror of seeing her child possessed by Satan.<br />Jason Miller in his guilt-ridden role of Father Karras is mesmerizing.  Tormented and doubting his faith, he nonetheless conquers these and propels the movie's grueling climax.<br />Max von Sydow as Father Merrin is brilliant in his subtle performance of a man near death faced with the unbelievable task of exorcising not just a demon, but the devil himself.<br />Linda Blair's performance is all the more amazing in that as everyone knows, Mercedes McCambridge mouthed the demon's voice, but Linda was there physically and her agony (especially in those awful hospital tests) demonstrates what potential she had, that was unfortunately never fully tapped in later films.<br />Kitty Winn as Burstyn's personal assistant was also very good in a supporting, almost invisible role.<br />And let's not forget Lee J. Cobb as Kinderman, a cop with a heart and soul a great pickup line.<br />THE EXORCIST has never been duplicated for its gut-wrenching horror and it's ability to creep under your skin no matter how often you've seen it.<br />A true classic in any genre.
0385504209|5.0|This book made me question some of the core aspects of Christianity.  While it is a book of fiction, it does get you thinking.  While I don't recommend that anyone read this book as fact, it is a good starting point to consider a different point of view.  Dan Brown is a fantastic writer who combines suspense with historical fiction in a seamless manner.  It's definitely a page-turner, with new surprises in every chapter.  I read the book in 2 sittings, only because I had to leave the house to run errands!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|As a big Britney fan I rushed out and bought this as soon as it was released. After the first listen i wasnt too sure that I liked it. I'd heard that she was trying something different with this album but then she'd said that with the last one too...<br />It is very different to the last three and it somehow didnt seem to fit together very well as all the songs are so different. But after a couple of listens i decided that I did like it a lot even though there are a couple of dud songs.<br />1. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC<BR>I like this song although i think it'd be better without Madonna who's clearly only in it to help it sell. Its on a similar thread to slave 4u although nowhere near as good. Not the best on the album (7/10)<br />2.I'VE GOT THAT BOOM BOOM<BR>I love this song. Here she ropes in the Ying Yang twins and goes for the commercial hip hop sound. Hopefully a future single. (9/10)<br />3.SHOWDOWN<BR>This is one of the songs i wasnt sure about at the start as its such a mixture of musical styles and sounds like they're trying a bit hard to make it sound cool. Its definately a grower though and to compare it to another Brit song, its probably most similar to Lonely.(7/10)<br />4. BREATHE ON ME <BR>This is one that I dont like. Its very Kylie Minogue and I would actually think it was her if I'd heard it on the radio. It doesnt really go anywhere and gets a tad boring (4/10)<br />5. EARLY MORNIN<BR>This was the track that was produced by Moby and its one of the best on the album. Unlike Showdown it sticks with the simple and it really pays off. (8/10)<br />6. TOXIC<BR>This is one of the only songs on the album that sounds like old Britney and its one of the best. (10/10)<br />7. OUTRAGEOUS<BR>This one was written by R Kelly but it seems to sum up Britneys life at the moment. It does sound a lot like R Kellys recent hits but I really like it and it suits Britneys voice really well. (10/10)<br />8. TOUCH OF MY HAND<BR>This another one that I dont like. Its about... well... something quite rude that I'm probably not allowed to mention!!! Its got a similar sound to Breathe on me but just doesnt suit her voice at all. (4/10)<br />9. HOOK UP<BR>I absolutely love this song... untill it gets to the bit where Britney tries to rap in a faux Jamaican accent. Now i love her to bits but i cant help but CRINGE and really wish someone had told her to please stop. It annoying because its a great song apart from that and it kinda ruins it! (10/10 for most of the song but goes down to -10 when the rap comes in!!!)<br />10. SHADOW<BR>I love this song but it is a bit naff and cheesy!!! Sounds a bit like an 80s ballad!!! But its cute and makes her voice sound nice. (8/10)<br />11. BRAVE NEW GIRL<BR>This one is great but would be better if you could actually understand what she was saying. The verses are so fast you can't make the words out and the bridge is all synthesisers and vo-coders that completely distort the words.<BR>Still its quite boppy and funky and is supposed to be one of Britneys favourites. (9/10)<br />12. EVERYTIME<BR>I love this song and already everyone is saying its for Justin. I dont care really but the song is quite sweet. Again its really simple with just Brit a harp and a piano. (8/10)<br />13. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC REMIX<BR>Not even gonna bother. Pointless and crap<br />14. THE ANSWER<BR>This is the one that was written by P. Diddy. Its starts off really good and I thought I was gonna love it but the chorus is the most uncatchy thing I've ever heard and doesnt grow on you no matter how many times you listen to it! (5/10)<br />15. DONT HANG UP<BR>I love this song aswell and its a good one to finish the album with. It sounds very floaty and has a really nice melody that really suites her voice. (8/10)<br />In general its a great album but not really what you would expect from Britney. It will appeal to people who arent fans but then as its her, I very much doubt any of them will go out and buy it. I guess this will be make orbreak time for her. She's moving away from the music that her current fans love her for in an attempt to grow up, but unfortunately i dont think she'll find it particularly easy to get a more grown up audience to take her seriously!
B00005JMCW|5.0|Let me just start by saying that Disney's remake of \\"Freaky Friday\\" is a lot of fun.  I enjoyed watching this umpteenth hundred take on the \\"parent-child-switch-body-because-you-don't-understand-my-life-at-all\\" concept.  What makes this film really work is the very impressive performances.  I will start with Lindsay Lohan, who I think convincingly embodies the parent role (the scene that shows her admonishing her \\"friends,\\" while also pulling down the blouse of one of the girls is hilarious!) while also expressing the angst of a young girl quite well.<br />But the real joy and surprise of this film is the incredible performance of Jamie Lee Curtis. I wholeheartedly agree with the many critics who are saying that this work deserves consideration  by the Academy.  This is a performance worthy of at least an Oscar nod!!  Hold your lunch and your complaints skeptics and naysayers for just a second.  So often we equate good performances with dramatic scenes and histrionics.  Comedy is difficult--as many an actor has said, and physical comedy is even more difficult.  Curtis pulls this off with style, grace and comedic elan.  I truly believed she was a teenager!  As an example, watch the scene with Chad Michael Murray at the diner/hangout when they are discussing music--watch Curtis' body language.  This is good work people!!  I hope the Academy sees the value of this work just as they did Tom Hanks' in \\"Big.\\"  <BR>She truly deserves to be among the five nominated for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.  The five stars I rate this film are chiefly a result of Curtis' superb work.<BR>Rent/buy this film--you will not be disappointed!
B000065BPB|5.0|These are absolutely amazing headphones, especially for the price.  All this talk of weak bass and &quot;breaking them in&quot; must come from people who don't have or can't operate an equalizer.  Really, the sound is excellent out of the box, if it gets better with use then I am looking forward to hearing it.  I can't say how they'll hold up over time because I just recently aquired them, but they feel very solid.  <P>I bought them so I could watch movies and listen to music without disturbing my neighbors, and I couldn't be more pleased.  They keep out most of the noise (I'd say maybe 15 dB, the numbers they give on the spec sheet are high) the noise so I can turn on my dishwasher or washing machine and still watch movies undisturbed.
B00000634J|5.0|I just recently got this DVD from my friend, and I was surprised I got it. I loved John Lennon with the Beatles and with his solo career which was very successful until his death in 1980. I watched this DVD and I was amazed, very good video clips, but Happy X-mas was a little sad, in fact....very sad. And I found a bunch of songs on this DVD I never knew he wrote but I have heard before. (Same with the Beatles). This is quite possibly one of my favorite DVDs not just because I'm a huge Beatles and Lennon fan but because it has great music and learn the life of John Lennon from himself. There is one thing I do not like about this DVD is there's to much Yoko One, and I don't like Yoko Ono since she was like 90% of the reason the Beatles broke up, but thats just me.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|This is a wonderful album from Whitney Houston, better than I expected.  She imparts most of the songs with soul and feeling; she sings Christmas as it should be sung.  She's not just bleating the songs out, like Ashanti.  Generally, the arrangements and production are also fresh and impeccable.  The strongest tracks are the more gospel-influcend songs, like &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot;, &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, and &quot;I'll be Home For Christmas.&quot;  The zippy medley &quot;Deck the Halls/Silent Night&quot; also works, surprisingly, as does the original ballad &quot;One Wish.&quot;  Her best offering, though is &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, a song that needs a VOICE to do it justice, and I think Whitney fits the bill beautifully.<br />On the negative side, I didn't care for  &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; (the cheesy addition of non-singing Bobbi Kristina is a mistake).  &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; is also not so great.  She adds nothing to a song that has been attempted by many and mastered by few.  Throughout the album, too, excessive &quot;riffs&quot; which seem to include intolerable mangling of classic lyrics and proper grammer, only serve to irritate.  There are too may examples to name.<br />Overall, I think this is one of the better Christmas albums out there, and one of the best this year, from what I've heard.  I'll admit that it doesn't trump Mariah's classic, but it's still stirring and highly &quot;listenable.&quot;  Four stars.  Nicely done.
B000002H33|1.0|I used to like Metallica. But now that me and my friends talk black and listen to HIP-HOP I (now)realize how lame I used to be! If you wanna hear REAL music go and get the new PUFF DADDY. Peace, homies!
B00005JLPK|3.0|This is a beautifully acted, colorful, exuberant movie.  But anyone who wants to learn about the gruff and disturbing real life of Frida, needs to seek out the truth elsewhere.  This was just too pretty in every sense.
0375422307|4.0|Marjane ain't got it up on Art, that's for sure. Read this and enjoy because it's a powerful memory trip, but Spiegelman's Maus runs circles around it. My daughter read it and complained that the characters &quot;all look the same.&quot; I agree, and I too see that as a problem. That wasn't a problem in Maus, where the similarity of the characters to each other was part of the point (German stereotypes about Jews saw them as all the same, like mice, etc.).<br />All in all, the horrors of life-during-wartime are effectively conveyed here, and the trials and losses of Marjane should make American readers realize how good they've got it in their giant, insulated bubbleland. Won't be long though, thanks to our current administration. Reading this book should make Americans realize what they've got comin as a result of not listening to the messages of supposedly mindless &quot;terrorists.&quot; The daily surreality and death of &quot;blowback&quot; are on their way, ushering in another stolen election. <br />The brief mentions of American government complicity in the horrors offered by Satrapi are noble, and one can only hope that she'll reveal more of it in a sequel. Becoming fully aware of that complicity, and stopping it, is the only way the relatively idyllic peace of America will continue.
B0000AQS6R|3.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie and never a year passes that I don't watch it at least once. I'm glad to have this on widescreen DVD. The commentary track is awful - especially Beverly D'Angelo who rambles on about her hair. The worst commentary track I've ever heard. <br />Still if you don't have this on DVD, get it!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|When you see the movie, you can clearly see that there are plenty of opportunities for tons and tons of emotional, powerful music. Howard Shore takes advantage of every one of them. The music really gets inside of you, instilling you with a fitting emotion be it a fright, battle, or love scene. The orchestral performance is excellent as well. The Anne Lennox song is a little out of place, but who cares when the rest is so fantastic???
B000088E6D|5.0|Not sure what the bad critics are complaining about.  Nice to hear a fresh voice with different arrangments on some of these ancient songs.  Songs from the 'old' masters of which I love but don't mind hearing something a bit different. <br />I really believe this guy has a gift and nice to see some singing from younger voices in today's era instead of dance, techno, rock, and rap.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|APC's first album, Mer de Noms, gave me an impression that Tool had taken some Ritalin.  It's a more melodic, swooning, and sedated sound.  Though they share a similar sound with Tool APC should be without fault considered a completely separate band. In the 13th Step album, there's more grit than previously, there are more effects, and there is a new feel.  It's more engaging.  <BR>The album's theme is pretty obvious from the title, but incase the denser of the audience cannot pick it up, I'll explain.  Tracks such as \\"Weak and Powerless\\"  \\"The Noose\\", and the album title gives you a clear idea that the album is about drug addiction.  So do the lyrics. \\"Tilling my own grave to keep me level/Jam another dragon down the hole\\".  The album however lacks the tracks that captivate you for hours, such as Mer de Noms \\"Orestes\\" or \\"Thomas\\".<BR>By itself it is a good album, I feel however that a lot of people would give any album Maynard whispered on a 10; but to me compared to Mer de Noms and a three year hiatus, I'm left a bit disappointed.  People forget that it's a pretty new band - the only two original members are Billy Howardel (the founder and guitarist) and Maynard.  A disapointment for me was to see the lines blur between the styles of APC and Tool - but, they still remain completely seperate.  I give this album a 3.8 because I'm fickle, so I'll just give it a 4.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is a great album. I am really feeling &quot;If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By&quot;. This song keeps me groovin. Hopefully, &quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot; (reminds of TLC &quot;Waterfall&quot; and Fugees &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;) will be the next single. It's a great r&amp;b/hip hop track ala Fugees/TLC. &quot;Wake Up&quot; is great, a good morning song. &quot;Streets of New York&quot; should have been included in the album. Maybe, it might be in the second release of &quot;Diary of Alicia Keys&quot;. Two thumbs up.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Alicia Keys... simply a genius in her own right. She finally gets what these other artists fail to see... IT'S OKAY TO GO ON A HIATUS TO MAKE A QUALITY CD...(NO NAMES NEEDED)<br />But as far as this CD... it's WONDERFUL. My 57 year old grandmother loves this CD! It's timeless... When I first heard &quot;You Don't Know My Name,&quot; I thought it was an old Jackson 5 record (seriously). But when I realized who it was, I KNEW I had to have this in my collection! Congratulations...
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|The first album was really pretty good, though probably not classic. This album would be considered good if it were put out by an unknown indie band. It's silly how fans of a band can be so biased that they accept this crap and give it these kinds of ratings. The Strokes had their 15 minutes and unfortunately for them they are fading away insted of burning out. The addition of the new lead guitar sound will please the indie pundits, it sounds silly and novelty and takes away any hope for rock legitimacy.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is the result of the &quot;Musicians&quot; in the band getting together to just creatively JAM!!!  I Loved this CD...It's like Liquid Tension with a smidge of LaBrie, whoI feel is the weakest link in DT.  This is what I wanted to hear from DT when &quot;Infinity&quot; came out.  &quot;Train&quot;was written in 3 weeks and most of you out there will not appreciate the raw, unabashed nature of this gem, too bad! The solos ripped out by Petrucci is worth the price of the cd alone.  Fans of Portnoy's playing will also NOT be disappointed!  Pick this one up and hear it for yourself!
B000002J1M|5.0|Genesis' \\"Foxtrot,\\" like \\"Nursery Cryme\\" and their first \\"Live\\" album, certainly lacks the production gloss that characterizes their recordings from \\"Selling England by The Pound\\" onward.  But what the album lacks in polish, it more than makes up for with raw energy, bold performances, and brilliant compositions.  This is progressive rock played without a safety net: always taking risks, and nearly always succeeding.<br />\\"Watcher of the Skies,\\" with its portentous Mellotron intro, opens the album with organic, elemental power; it's as if the song existed from the dawn of time.  Indeed, all of \\"Foxtrot\\" possesses this timeless quality - one reason the album has held up so well over the years.<br />The nostalgic \\"Time-table\\" evokes a room filled with dust-covered tomes, waiting for their secrets to be discovered.  \\"Get `Em Out by Friday,\\" a whimsical commentary on predatory landlords, finds Genesis in social-commentary mode.  \\"Can-Utility and the Coastliners,\\" my choice for \\"Most Underrated Genesis Song Ever,\\" crystallizes the band's early Seventies style into six action-packed minutes.  There's also \\"Horizon's,\\" a lovely solo acoustic piece by Steve Hackett.<br />And then, last but not least, there's \\"Supper's Ready.\\"  Words fail when trying to describe this beautiful and bizarre epic.  It simply has to be heard to be believed.  Suffice it to say that it's 23 minutes of everything you ever wanted in a progressive rock song, and more.<br />In my opinion, \\"Foxtrot\\" is easily the best of the Gabriel-era records, and, with the possible exception of \\"A Trick of the Tail,\\" arguably Genesis' best album ever.
0375414053|1.0|I thought I would enjoy this book. And I did at first. However, I started to hate it after a while, finding it extremely depressing. We follow the life of Kate Reddy, a working mom with a marriage that is on the rocks, and who is finding herself drawn to another man...who lives across the Atlantic. I found most of Kate's life boring, especially the bits about her job because I had no idea what Kate's job was. Perhaps I'm a bit to young to try and understand exactly what Allison Pearson was trying to say about working mothers. However, to me, it was like she was saying it couldn't be done if you wanted to be great in both arenas.
B000001G89|2.0|Berganza isn't a tragic actress. Her bright voice is deprived of true sensuality. No sign of intensity, no \\"tears in her eyes\\". Only feeling's convincing - the hate: after her furious last \\"Tiens!\\" I understand that Jose has nothing but kill her.<BR>The vocal aspect of this interpretation is also sad: Carmen requires finest musicality and perfect voice control that Berganza can hardly provide. Her tempi are mechanical, accents - primitive, the lack of dynamic shades - fatal. Sometimes she produces beautiful sound, but generally  lower register sounds rough, tremolos - not elastic enough, tops - screaming (last \\"tra-la-la\\" in \\"Seguedille\\" - just awful).    <BR>Though Domingo's interpretation is as always excellent vocally, he can't touch me still. Cotrubas's charming, her musicality excites me. Chorus sounds wonderful. Abbado's button is uneven: sometimes - good ( \\"A deux cuatros\\"),  most times - not (sleepy \\"oiseau rebelle\\", too fast final).
0671027344|5.0|this is THE ABSOLUTE BEST book i have ever opened. i have read it too many times to count and have given a copy to most of my family and friends. it is so true to what life can really be like for a high schooler. i can relate a lot to this book. it is so full of emotional. u want to cry and laugh right along with charlie. even with all the times i've read i still can put it down. even my mom is reading it. it truely is the best book i have ever read.
B00000IPAX|4.0|This is the c.d that dramatically influenced my taste in music. I have been a Blink fan since the first time I heard them, which was about 5 years ago, when this c.d came out. This was one of the first c.d's i ever bought, and from the moment i pressed play to the end, i was blown away. this was the first cd that i had ever thouroughly enjoyed, beginning to end. It may be a far-off comparison to Blink's &quot;old school&quot; stuff, like Buddha and Cheshire Cat, but it is nonetheless a very enjoyable c.d. It is very clean and 'polished' sounding, with much better vocals and harmonizing than any of Blink's previous stuff. If you put aside all the labeling of Blink as &quot;sellouts&quot; and don't take music labels so seriously, then you will enjoy this. The songs are catchy, funny, and can be a little bit crude. In my opinion, this is not their best, but it is a very good c.d, and i would highly reccommend it. And yes, it is possible to be a fan of Blink's old AND new music. you just need to be open-minded.
0553381407|5.0|This is the best mental health self-help book I've read.  It takes a balanced approach in that the author says we can take the power back from our toxic parents, but that we shouldn't try to do so without help and support.  She's also honest about the results we can expect.  If our parents have never shown the qualities we hope for in good parents, why expect them to start showing such qualities now?  The author's goal is to break the continuing pattern of abuse, which, she points out, can even continue after the death of our parents.<br />Through real life experiences and transcripts of therapy sessions, the author demonstrates how toxic parents can greatly influence the way we view or treat ourselves today.  By breaking the codes of silence and launching open communication in a family, we can help everyone in the family take responsibility for their own actions.<br />The book is very empowering.  It helps us confront long-supressed emotions and then encourages us to spend time with those emotions before rushing through the book.  At the same time, it puts the responsibility for bad parenting where it belongs so we can stop punishing ourselves, and it lays out a plan of action that can change our relationships with our parents, hopefully for the better.  I highly recommend reading &quot;Toxic Parents&quot;.  We can't expect our parents to change, but we can change ourselves.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was instantly hooked on the gritty down at heal vision of the future that \\"Firefly\\" presents.   Mankind has finally made it to the stars, but has done so out of necessity and in doing so, has made a pigs ear of it.  This is not the bland and antiseptic view of the future presented by the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise, this is a believable future.  In the universe of \\"Firefly\\" things are getting worse before they have a chance to get any better.  The Anglo-Sino Alliance of Settled Worlds rules the Galaxy, a deeply repressive government that controls everything from the centre and resulting in the worlds on the rim being dirt poor.<br />Aboard the 03 Firefly class cargo vessel Serenity is Whedon's usual band of misfits trying to get by in life.  The ship is owned by Malcolm Reynolds, a veteran of the recent civil war, in which he was on the losing side, fighting for the right of planets to maintain their independence.  His second in command is Zoe Warren, who fought with him in the War.  `Wash' Warren, pilot and Zoe's husband, Kaylee Frye, the genius mechanic who keeps Serenity in the sky and Jayne Cobb, the hired muscle.  There is Also Inara Serra, a Companion or high class courtesan, who rents one of Serenity's shuttles, Shepherd Book a wandering Monk and Simon and River Tamm, a surgeon and his damaged sister, who are fugitives from the Alliance.   <br />This series only ran for eleven episodes on the FOX Network in the US.  Three of the episodes on this four DVD set have only ever broadcast outside its origin. This DVD set contains all the episodes in 16:9 widescreen, as they were originally filmed with Dolby Digital 6.1 Surround sound.  You cannot help but be impressed by the love that went into this series.  Everything on this show works, from the quality of the writing and acting, through special effects to the background music. And the love that went into the production of this series has been duplicated in this DVD set, with numerous special features and audio commentaries that add greatly to the enjoyment of each episode.  Shows this good happen once in a blue moon, and it is criminal the way that the FOX Network treated it when it was originally broadcast.  There are plans for a movie based on the series, and hopefully that and the success of this DVD set will show the FOX Network the error of its ways.
B00006690G|5.0|I never write anything obscene in my reviews. And they never approve my reviews or post them! I've seen horriblly rude reviews from people disgussing something other than this cd. But whatever! This cd titled Eminem Show is one of my favorites. I use to not like Eminem until I realized his talent. There was a show on, recently, and they were discussing a countdown for the top 50 best hip hop artists. Eminem was not only in the top 25, but was placed at number 6!!!! A couple spots up from 2 pac and biggy!!1! I was shocked to say the least. He obviously has got so big over the past few years that he has been around. What that guy said was racist. If Em's fans were only white and under 25, that wouldnt place him at number 6 in the top 50 best hip hop artists. Rundmc was number one. Just think about that. He's talented. He's loved. He's respected, and believe it or not he does have a heart! Sometimes it's harder to notice even among the angriest people.
0783117523|5.0|A true story, starring Angelina Jolie as Gia Marie Curangi (just call her Gia), who was one of the first American women who died from the AIDS virus.<br />This was filmed documentary style, which surprised me, although not too much of the documentary scenes interrupt the film. It does get annoying when this person is talking about Gia but who doesn't actually appear in Gia's life until later in the film, so you don't have a clue who they are.<br />Of course, Angelina Jolie stars as Gia, throwing herself so much into the role that you forget where to draw the line between Angelina and Gia. Angelina almost became Gia, and it's hard to understand why exactly this film isn't better known. Forget Tomb Raider, forget Girl, Interrupted, this should have been THE film of Angelina's career. Why it wasn't, is beyond me. The story is a stunning portrayal of a young girl thrown in at the deep end, and not knowing what to do.<br />Alongside Angelina, Faye Dunaway plays a small, but very much needed role in this. She stars as Gia's agent, and also her mentor. Gia will phone her in the middle of the night to talk, and when she dies, Gia is left alone and lost. Thus begins her downward spiral into the fatal world of drugs.<br />By the back cover of the DVD, you know Gia's character dies, so you're expecting that. What you don't expect is how drawn out it is, but how fast the film goes. At just under 2 hours long, it was over before I knew it. Once she's discovered as having AIDS, the film quickly progresses into a drugs/AIDS story, and its horrifying. The end scenes of Angelina show how great an actress she is, and just what drugs can do to you.<br />There is a lot of nudity in this film. But it's done very well - or as well as it can be, when there are almost full frontal shots, but from far away. You would think this would turn you off the film, but it really attributes to what the film is. Angelina seems to have no qualms about her body and flaunted it to the max in this. She also flaunted her (small) collection of tattoos, but no Billy Bob scrawled across her upper arm, as this was before he came on the scene.<br />Angelina is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood at the moment. She's not your classic beauty - as Gia says in the film, \\"a woman isn't a woman unless she's blonde\\". But Angelina is beautiful; there's no doubt about it. She's one of these lucky women who look good without any makeup - not that I'm jealous of course!<br />Gia's character almost seemed schizophrenic at some points, and this could have been because of the drugs, but she's also very insecure about her various relationships. It was hard to see her change from a happy, smiley young girl, to an angry, crying woman, throwing stuff around.<br />I've never heard of Gia before this, but now I'm pleased I have this movie, and I can watch it whenever I want to. She was only 26 when she died, which is horrifying, considering how much she did in her short life. And she started modelling when she was 17, and started taking drugs soon after. But the people in the modelling world didn't seem to care that one of their finest models was doing drugs, as shown in the movie.<br />HIV can take a while to develop into AIDS, but the doctors said in the film, that it could have been from sharing a needle. You see very graphically the first time Gia injects herself, whereas before she was just sniffing. You don't see her injecting again after this, which made me think this was when she got HIV then.<br />It's quite scary as the film goes on, before you realise there is anything wrong with her, because you notice her hair getting greyer and greyer, and bags appearing under her eyes.<br />The very start, when you see Gia getting makeup put on her, is a bit freaky, but I won't explain why, you have to watch the end, as the scenes get repeated.<br />All in all, a great film, and definitely re-watchable. It will shock you to the core and one of Angelina's best performances yet.e also flaunted her (small) collection of tattoos, but no Billy Bob scrawled across her upper arm, as this was before he came on the scene. <br />Angelina is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood at the moment.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Although I think Spectars wall of sound with heavy strings made the &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; a classic it was refreshing to hear the Beatles  songs in their original format. The prize to me goes to &quot;Across the Universe&quot; where Lennon starts with a couple of complicated introductory chords and alone with his guitar he just strums along letting his voice carry this upbeat looking at the future tune with a flurry of lyrics that make one feel its one song that can never be copied succesfully. I also enjoyed Lennon's &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; which just rocks. I think Lennon gains most on the album while Harrison's adlibs are fun while McCartney's vocals still sound pure. The Fly on the Wall second CD is a collection of Beatle prattle that is interesting along with practice takes. Their rough cut of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is fascinating which of course ends up on Harrison's great solo. Well worth it a buy.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|One thing I believe about this artist is that she is being true to her experience, and that she has been truly inspired in the past.  But this album is just not very good based on her past accomplishments.<br />She seems to be rehashing old inspiration. Typical of what fame can do. Surfacing -her last effor, seemed like a kind of weak to me.  Kind of like she was saying \\"I was inspired and in pain but now I'm thru it, and this is what it feels like to rise out of it.\\"  That album could have been called \\"Aftermath\\".  Now the aptly titled Afterglow is her reflecting on inspiration that has truly sunset.<br />She's a great singer, but really, the danger to her artistic soul is greater now than ever.  The dangers of material comfort, fame and complacency are some of the worst of all.
7119005901|5.0|If you have ever played any of KOEI Dynasty Series games, then you are familiar with the Han Dynasty and some of the Chinese History. If you were interested in knowing more than what you did in the video games, then this book is for you.<br />This is an awesome epic novel, sweeping the history of Chinese history. All of the characters that are in the Dynasty Series game are here for our further knowledge. Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Lu Bu, Cao Cao, Cao Song, Dio Chan, Sun Ce, Sun Quan, Sun Shiang San..... the list goes on and on.<br />This story written over a thousand years ago, accurately portrays the lives and feelings of these &quot;heroes&quot;. The author is a little swayed by the Shu family, and he seems to favor them, portraying Guan Yu, Liu Bei and Zhang Fei as the most loyal and honorable sworn brothers, with Cao Cao a sort of evil madman. But that is okay, since I never liked Cao Cao in the game anyway.<br />All in all, this is a long and worthwhile read. I would recommend the unabridged version as it is more complete and thorough. You will not be disapointed to see these wonderful characters come to life.
B000089RVX|1.0|In a nutshell, this album is just like one long continuous song.  After 20 minutes, I was thinking, &quot;when is this song going to be over?!&quot; only to find out that it was already on track 8.  Every single song sounds the same.  The same effect-laden drum beat, the same guitar rhythm, the same orchestra behind the band, and the same monotonous weaving melody that the girl sings.  I can't see why this band is so popular and so loved by the world.  It's just another product of MTV that they have shoved down peoples' throats.<br />There is an exception on this album, though.  Number 4, &quot;My Immmortal.&quot;  This is actually a pretty good song.  It's different enough from the rest of them that it stands out.  This is the only one I can tolerate, though.  The rest just drive me insane and make me want to cut my ears off.<br />As for the guy who was &quot;defining&quot; rock and pop, I think you're totally in the wrong.  There's no way you can say that all rock is natural and all pop is fake.  That is a completely over-generalized and ignorant statement.  While you may not like pop, and I don't like most pop, it doesn't mean that all pop is fake and horrible.  I hate it when people make stupid uneducated comments like that.<br />Anyway, all-in-all, the option for purchasing this CD is a no-brainer: DON'T DO IT!
B000002INR|5.0|Even when I'm not in a hard rock mood, I can always listen to this album all the way through. Most of their 'Big Haired' peers might've only had one or two other good songs on their albums, besides the hits. That should tell ya something.<br />1) Big Guns -- Dirty lyric-filled, loud, slightly bluesy pop/metal anthem. A great opener.<br />2) Sweet Little Sister -- Fast paced, heavy, but also extremely catchy and somewhat poppy tune.<br />3) Can't Stand the Heartache -- Only a teeny bit less heavy, but more of an arena rock 'post love' anthem. Very underrated and another highlight of the album you won't hear on the radio.<br />4) Piece of Me -- One of the hits/videos. Probably the toughest, heaviest song on the album. An angry sounding, almost straight metal tune about fighting and partying. It's still singable though.<br />5) 18 &amp; Life -- The most well-known tune. A melodic but still hard-edged pop/power ballad about a suicidal guy named Ricky. A slight departure from what most of the era's bands' power ballads sounded like.<br />6) Rattlesnake Shake -- Yet again, a tough, streetwise hard rocker about an, umm, prostitute. Reminds me of something Guns N' Roses would do.<br />7) Youth Gone Wild -- Another well known, shout-along rebellious (yet fun) anthem. Loud and heavy, yet slightly melodic.<br />8) Here I Am -- Not one of my favorites. A non-hit, rawer metal anthem.<br />9) Makin' A Mess -- A fast paced hard rocker, but it strays from the 'Get Chicks and Party' theme of the album. A first person account of, what sounds like, spouse abuse. Told in an anti- kind of way, but not a ballad at all.<br />10) I Remember You -- The other power ballad of the album. A somewhat accoustic tune in parts, almost reminding me of Mr Big's hit &quot;To Be With You.&quot; It still rocks, but it's probably the lighest song here.<br />11) Midnight/Tornado -- Yet another underrated rocker that got away. This one has more of a melodic, power rock sound to it. It's somewhat heavy as well, but it's one of those songs even someone who isn't a fan of hard rock could like.<br />Even though I'd technically call this a heavy metal album, it's actually pretty varied. It's a little harder and meaner than Poison, Bon Jovi or Def Leppard. It's not quite as rough and more melodic than Megadeth, Metallica or Guns &amp; Roses. It's more pop than Judas Priest or Iron Maiden. Yet it fits enough into all the afforementioned styles to be recommended to fans of any or all of those bands. The closest equivalent is probably Motley Crue.<br />I highly recommend geting this album over their 'Greatest Hits', simply because there's a number of cool, severely underrated songs here that you won't find there, and are just as good as the 4 hits.ell, but it's one of those songs even someone who isn't a fan of hard rock could like.<br />Even though I'd technically call this a heavy metal album, it's actually pretty varied. It's a little harder and meaner than Poison, Bon Jovi or Def Leppard. It's not quite as rough and more melodic than Megadeth, Metallica or Guns &amp; Roses. It's more pop than Judas Priest or Iron Maiden. Yet it fits enough into all the afforementioned styles to be recommended to fans of any or all of those bands.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This features two of the most dazzling performers on broadway: Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth!  While the legendary Joel Gray is unfortuneately wasted, it's still a pleasure to hear him performing on broadway again!  The score to Wicked is reminiscent of Schwartz's other scores, particularly &quot;The Magic Show&quot; and the music in the show ranges from bone-chilling (Defying Gravity) to tear-jerking (For Good.) This is a perfect buy for musical theater fans of ALL ages.<br />--TODD

0385504209|2.0|book I have read this year.  You can find several howlingly-bad sentences per page.  The opening page is a great example of the train-wreck-bad overwriting that makes up Brown's &quot;style.&quot;  Brown is an absolutely abysmal writer and I am confident that most of you could write a superior treatment of his idea than he could.<br />In a way, it's a shame because the &quot;transhistorical&quot; conspiracy and the info about Jesus and medieval secret societies he used as a prop was very interesting.  I learned interesting things from the novel but, as a thriller afficionado, I could not believe how talentless a hack Brown is.
B00005JMFO|1.0|Wow another Wooden non Oscar worthy performance by the most wooden of men, Yes you've guessed it, Hugh Grant.  The British always curse and put down awful performers like Hugh Grant but never seem to pick on he's incredibly crap acting, the man sucks.  As for movies starring this hack then I can assure you this really sucks.  Why do the British keeping making these god awful romantic comedies, they never work and are never funny.  This is a movie for grannies and losers so if your neither then take my advice and watch something else.
B00005JKJA|3.0|There was once a time when I thought David Lynch was a great director, the result of viewing his masterpiece, Blue Velvet and the early episodes of Twin Peaks.  Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the later episodes of that TV series, Lynch had gradually changed from weird and good to just weird for the sake of weird.  Making something comprehensible seemed to take a back seat to dancing midgets, and my appreciation for his work diminished.  Mulholland Drive shows flashes of his Blue Velvet brilliance, but is generally as disappointingly strange as many of his more recent films.<br />The story opens with a beautiful woman riding in a limousine along the street in the title.  Just as the driver and his partner are about to kill her, she is involved in a car crash that leaves her with amnesia and everyone else dead.  She wanders into the life of another woman who is an aspiring actress and the two of them investigate who she is.  Meanwhile, a movie director is forced by mysterious people to cast a specific woman in his movie for reasons that are never clear.  In fact, there is a lot that isn't clear and seem almost thrown in to intentionally make the movie more muddled.  Maybe on some level, it all makes sense, but I prefer a movie that doesn't require multiple viewings and a user's guide to attain any level of comprehensibility.<br />The movie is not all bad...far from it.  In many places, it looks pretty good and if you look at it without worrying about the big picture, you might enjoy it.  But most viewers will demand more out of a movie than what this delivers.  I cannot give this movie a whole-hearted recommendation, but I can say that if you go into it not expecting to understand it, there is a bit of fun to be found.

6304981635|4.0|Although martial arts films have made a bit of a comeback in recent years (thanks to Jackie Chan and Jet Li, among others), for a number of years, the movie was filled with cheap-looking, low quality flicks from Asia.  Thirty years ago, however, there was one big name who gave this genre a brief period of prominence: Bruce Lee.  Of all his movies, the one that always stands out is Enter the Dragon.<br />Enter the Dragon is essentially a kung fu version of a James Bond movie.  Lee plays Lee, a Shao Lin monk recruited by the government to stop an evil warlord.  The warlord himself is straight out of a Bond flick, with his fortress and army, his giant bodyguard and his own deadly artificial hand.  Admittedly, his ambitions are smaller than world conquest, but he is focused primarily on drugs and prostitution.  John Saxon plays a gambler also on the island who may or may not be a good guy; Saxon, a B-movie actor in essentially a B-movie, is probably the best actor in the bunch.<br />The movie itself has its problems.  Lee fluctuates between stoic and hammy, all sorts of things are either explained too much or too little and there is a muddled sequence of a flashback within a flashback.  On the other hand, story, acting and character are not really what matters in this movie; this is primarily a vehicle to show Lee's prowess in fight sequences, and here things work well.  <br />By no means a great movie, Enter the Dragon does succeed on the level it aspires to, and in its own way, it is a major film in its genre.  For that reason, it rates (a weak) four stars, and if you like B-movie action, this should be a decent diversion.
B00005ALRO|4.0|This is a fine vehicle for Harrison Ford made even more agreeable by a clever, somewhat tongue in cheek performance by Tommy Lee Jones as a US Marshall out to have a good time getting the bad guy, even though the bad guy might not be so bad, and even though that's irrelevant, but hey, don't think so much and get me some coffee and a chocolate donut with those sprinkles on top, ya hear?<br />This is also a Hollywood producer's orgasmic dream with a chase scene beginning in the first reel and lasting throughout.  It is based on the 60s TV show of the same name, but gets its premise from a true crime story, that of Ohioan Dr. Sam Shepherd who actually went to jail for murdering his wife in the 50s.  He too claimed to have fought off the real killer, but the forensic evidence and his personality were against him.  Here we have Harrison Ford as the good doctor, and it doesn't take a Hollywood genius to tell you that the most popular leading man of the late twentieth century ain't about to play the kind of guy who murders his loving wife.<br />Ford does a stand-up, competent job, saving lives and patting kids on the head as he plunges through sewers and off the top of a towering waterfall, steals an ambulance, survives a bullet wound and a bus wreck, etc.  His fans will be pleased, but Tommy Lee Jones steals the show (and got a Best Supporting Oscar for his trouble) as a clever, wise-cracking good ole boy who has a lot of fun leading the posse.  I wonder if he or director Andrew Davis invented the spin because without it, this wouldn't be half so good.<br />This is not to be confused with, nor is it a remake of The Fugitive from 1947 starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford, a cinematic gem of an entirely different sort.<br />See this for Tommy Lee Jones who has made a career out of turning oh-hum parts into something special.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Now i just loved Chrisitina's first album, it was off the hook and the second one is better! X-tina's grown now and lets us now she is by her sexy vibes and powerful vocals. The album is hot, off the hook, i mean what else can i say. SHE CAN SANG! Some of the best songs are can't hold us down, infatuation, & so many more i just love this album!!! Forget people like Britney spears who can't sing cause christina can! X-tina's imgae may be oversexed but her lyrics show her true feeling on life and her struggles. Well thats it my last word of advice is buy the album!BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!
B00004SZWD|5.0|This was and still is an astounding confounding compounding  tribute to music!  If I have to break it down for you track by track or CD 1 and 2...then you've been asleep for the past 20+ years and really should run out and get this CD because you are wayyyyyyyyy behind!  Run, don't walk!<br />AS...was and still is one of the baddest jams ever from any artist past, present and throw in the the future too!!  Listen to the words, not just the beat!
B000006O7C|4.0|Jeff Buckley's second studio album is only half finished but still better than what most of todays pop dreck will release in thier pitiful careers. Standouts include the seductive 'Everybody here wants you' the playful 'Witches rave' and the epic love song 'Vancouver' a 3 minute rollercoaster ride of a song about being the \\"other man\\". These 3 songs alone make this album worth buying whether you're a fan or not.
B00008RH3L|5.0|(WARNING: This film is definitely not for everyone, even if you're a gangster or noir film fan.)<br />There is nothing about this film I dislike: plot, dialogue, wonderfully composed deep-focus shots, the subtle tri-color scheme which I missed on first viewing (which of course is the point of the film: we see, but do not observe), the characters, the Celtic-tinged score, editing, sound effects,acting, etc. The Coen brother's films are often offbeat to begin with, but this film reveals a depth rarely seen in this most commercial of eras.
B00005KK4P|5.0|Beecham will always have the best when it comes to charm, see his EMI recordings of 3, 5 and 7.<br />Krips' 9th will always be one of the great recordings.<br />Sinopoli's 8th will always have a special place in my (musical) heart.<br />But Bohm is a huge surprise to me.  This set is wonderful!  and the Berlin Philharmonic outdoes itself!<br />The 8th is incredible, not only in how dreamy and romantic the performance is (although not relying on cheap interpretive tricks), but the superhuman demands that Bohm puts on the orchestra, which is clearly met in a breath-taking way.  Time stands still in a very cool way, but keep track of the beat, and you'll be very surprised.  What a master!<br />The 9th is, well, incredible.  Just listen to the detail in I and I hope you'll be convinced.  Even the most secondary theme is finely detailed and appropriately expressive.  I love the &quot;European&quot; oboe sound, too.<br />The early symphonies are just as good.  The 5th may be a little slow, but doesn't seem to suffer for all that, and fits Bohm's rich carpeted, luxurious interpretation.  The BPO strings are all here in their glory.<br />The DG engineering and remastering is also a very nice surprise.d  Very warm (yes, DG, warm!) and good bass (for a change).  Heartily recommended!!!<br />Provides a nice foil to the Arte Nova set with the Putbus Festival Orchestra, which is full of wonderful performances with a small orchestra.
B00004XONN|4.0|Not a bad album, but I'm still not completely sold on these guys. You see lists with their albums ranking close behind great albums like Abbey Road. Well this album is good but doesn't quite rank up with the Beatles. That being said, the opener is a good layering of studio effects with a nice groove. The big theme is Thom Yorkes politics and concern about the retreat of the Polar Ice caps. On Ice Age we're treated to a good electronic beat with some chilling synth effects. <br />The other plus about this album is the fact that despite the bands rising popularity they continue with their experimentation with sound and new exciting instruments.
0385512104|5.0|Mark Haddon's heart-breaking, heart-warming book, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is about Christopher, an autistic 15 year-old. It is written in the first person, as Christopher begins writing a book as a school project. He is at first investigating the death of a neighborhood dog, but the book, and his life, takes a turn he never expected as he comes to learn more about his parents, family dynamics, humans in general, and what he, himself, is capable of achieving.<br />I had a special interest in reading this book, as I work with autistic pre-schoolers. It gives a wonderful insight into the mind of the autistic, explaining behaviors that may seem irrational on the surface, but that really serve a purpose for the survival of the child.<br />Oddly enough, the strength of this book (Christopher's narration) was also the book's weakness. It is very rare that anyone with Christopher's degree of autism would be able to explain his actions, thoughts, emotions. It was wonderful reading what was going on in Christopher's mind, but at the same time, I knew that it was so improbable that anyone like him would have been able to be so eloquent.<br />None the less, this is a funny, sad, unforgettable novel that I highly recommend.
6304711875|1.0|Like other reviewers, I had to stop the tape after the first couple of sceens. I couldn't stand to watch it to the end.<br />Why would a girl carry on a conversation over the telephone with a known killer, instead of hanging up and call the police ? Who runs around town randomly killing people while wearing a stupid mask and a black cape ? The killer is a skinny little teenager, and he/she is able to overpower so many victims !!!!???<br />Buy the first Final Destination instead of this trash, Scream.
B0000DFZZC|1.0|Seabiscuit is a good addition to your DVD library, but save the extra money and buy the single disc.  I feel taken by the 2 disc set.  The only real addition is the Match Race footage which is only a few minutes.  The Winner's Circle, HBO First Look and True Story are all re-edits of the interviews and commentaries on the first disc.  It's too bad that the studio did this because I will never pay for extra features again.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.
0385504209|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this book and how amazing it was. I do not read. I made my way through college skimming books, reading a few chapters and reading their summaries online. This is the only book I have ever read every word of. It's amazing.<br />The story leaves you wanting more. I found myself staying up late just to see what happened next. It also was very thought provoking for me. I am a devout Catholic and it really opened my mind to new possibilities. There is so much out there that I have never been exposed to and this book helped me to realize that. I am going to read as much as I can now about the topic.<br />You seriously need to buy this book. You will not be disappointed.
B000088E6D|5.0|This CD from Michael Bubl is absolutely amazing.  I have loved swing music for a long time, especially the Rat Pack; Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr, all of which Bubl would have been loved by.  It is also good to see modern day artists going back to sing the classics, this album and Robbie William's 'Swing When Your Winning' album the true standouts. Michael Bubl's voice is pure, sassy and amazing.  He performs the songs so well and makes them his own, which is what makes this album such a standout.  A truly great cover song is when the song has the soul of the original with the new artist's signature on it and all of the songs seem fresh with Bubl's interpretation.  I especailly like 'How Can You Mend A Broken Heart', 'Come Fly With Me' and 'That's All'.  If buying this from Amazon, make sure you also pick up Michael Bubl's 'Let it Snow EP' for Christmas.
B00000ING2|4.0|After a string of critically acclaimed films it seemed inevitable that the Coens would eventually get slammed by the critics at some point. The Hudsucker Proxy was that film. Criticized for unsuccessfully blending the sensibilities of Frank Capra and Preston Sturges and tagged with a title that the general public did not understand, the film disappeared quickly from theaters.<br />It's too bad because there is a lot going on in this film. As always, it has the Coens flawless, stunning production values. This was the first film where the boys had a huge budget to play with and boy did they ever put every cent up on the screen. This is a fantastical version of New York City in the '50s -- think Terry Gilliam's Brazil but with all the nightmarish, Orwellian influences.<br />The film also features the Coens trademark snappy dialogue. Lots of verbal acrobatics and a cast that is more than up for the task. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the stand-out as she morphs effortlessly into Katherine Hepburn with her rapid-fire delivery and very distinctive way of speaking. She is excellent. Tim Robbins, at first, seems like an unlikely guy to play a schlub, a dim-witted patsy. But then take a look at his career-defining performance in Bull Durham to see that the Coens knew exactly what they were doing when they cast him.<br />Paul Newman is also wonderful as the evil Sidney J. Mussberger (love that name!) and he imparts just the right amount of comical menace.<br />Fans of Sam Raimi will want to check this one out for two reasons. First, Sam's main man, Bruce Campbell has a significant role as Smitty, an ace reporter who is Leigh's foil throughout the film. It's great to see Campbell in a Coen bros. film -- I wish he'd be in more of 'em! Also, Raimi not only co-wrote the screenplay but he also did the bulk of the second unit work. Check out the famed hula hoop creation sequence. Sam directed that bit. He also has a cameo as one of the guys who thinks up the name Hula Hoop.<br />This is a really great film that deserves a larger audience. Many people regard this as the Coens weakest film to date but I dunno 'bout that. I love watching this movie and I have fond memories of seeing it on the big screen.<br />The DVD is fine with a solid transfer and good sound. Sadly, no real extras to speak of but it is definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of the Coens.a really great film that deserves a larger audience.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|I liked the first movie.  It was heavy on the talking but I looked at it like it was an origin film.  Once the seeds were planted, Singer could go anywhere he wanted.  He did with X-2. From start to finish, this movie by far is one one of the top comic book movie of at least the last 5 years.  Brilliant job with the addition of &quot;new&quot; mutants and even with a few shoutouts to other ones.  Hank McCoy getting interviewed, Remy's name popping up on the computer screen, and even Archangel's wings.  This was a good movie. One thing, I do wish that Lady Deathstrike had stuck around.
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay was critically acclaimed across the globe with their first major album, Parachutes, released back in 2000. With their hard rock roots combined with touching, soft rock melodies, Parachutes was a modern classic. It was also known for being deleivered by a band that nobody cared about or listened to. Coldplay was one of the most surprising bands in history, and a band that nobody thought would do very well, similar to the sleeper hit band, The White Stripes.<BR>On A Rush of Blood to the Head, Coldplay continues upon Parachutes and sticks to the formula that they have been using all along. A Rush of Blood to the Head has already turned out several great sleeper hits, including God Put a Smile Upon Your Face, and the best track that nobody listened to of 2002, Clocks. Since Coldplay stayed firmly rooted along the lines of Parachutes, it is all more the reason to buy this new album. Any fan of soft rock will enjoy it, and the original Coldplay fans will love it as well.

0553208845|5.0|I saw that more than 300 reviews have already been written on this book, but I felt that it would be one of the best ways to express my gratitude to this great work of Hermann Hesse.<br />the book say that wisdom is difficult to convey in words, as they always distort the essence. And this is what all great teachers from Lao-Tzu to Buddha to Osho have said all along. In fact more than 300 books convey the teachings of Osho. And each of his book is a masterpiece.<br />This book says some of the essence of the teachings of Buddha and Advaita. It convey them beautiful. When I read this book I feel myself very close to Siddhartha in his search of truth. This may be true that things can convey more than words, but I also think that words are important until we come to the point in our life when we are ready to see the divine in every things all around us. Please just don't read it, but try to experience the teachings in your life. Highly recommended.
B000089RVX|4.0|After reading some of the reviews on this site, I have to wonder if a lot of the negative comments might be because of the album's popularity driving up expectations.  Somehow I had managed to miss out on all the hype - the only song I'd heard was &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; and that was only because people at work were playing it.  Maybe because of this, I had no expectations before buying it.  I love the concept - hard-rocking music backing up pleasant, melodic female vocals - and I think the band does a great job of making it work.  Amy Lee has a beautiful voice (I'd bet anything that she was driven to the &quot;dark&quot; side because of so many people telling her she had such an angelic voice), and somehow she manages to blend that with hard-driving power chords without sounding the least bit out of place.  Also, the lyrics are well above average.  I think this album is very good in general, and excellent for a debut.  Based on this release, I am very much looking forward to their next offering to see how they mature.  My only real criticism is the album's production, though I can't specifically explain why.  Somehow, I just feel like the album could sound better and have even more impact if it was produced a bit differently.  Regardless, a worthy buy in my book!
B00005JMFR|5.0|When I first saw the Matrix, I was shocked, amazed, awed.  It instilled in me a sense of such jubilance that I could quote the script to you on the spot.  I could be called a fanatic; I love the movie and it's concept.  Reloaded was a tad bit surprising of a twist...I kind of liked it, but not entirely, but I resigned to allow the brilliant brother duo (Wachoswki Bros.) to do their thing and went to see Revolutions.  All that I could say when I got out of the theater was: \\"Better than the best movie of all time...the first one.\\"<BR>  Revolutions contains action, suspense, thrills, chills, romance, and any other genre you can think of.  It is getting many bad reviews, however, worldwide.  Why is this?  Because you have to be of a unique mindset to like it.  The original Matrix was much broader of an audience, touching to the nerds and the action-lovers...for people who didn't even understand it, it was awesome.  The reason Revolutions isn't doing as well even though it is considered by me to be even better is because it requires quite a bit of intelligence to enjoy thoroughly.  It is the perfect end to a perfect trilogy.  If you liked the first one or second one, or if you're just really into science fiction twists and turns in movies, make sure to go see this one.

B000002UAU|5.0|This review is not so much a review of the most-discussed rock album ever made, but to try to explain to some clueless reviewers here the extraordinary impact it had on Western culture when first released.  Never before or since has a work <BR>so grabbed the consciousness of an entire generation like \\"Pepper\\" did in the summer of '67.  Although psychedelic music was being made in the year previous to its release, \\"Pepper\\" seemed to tie it all together and point to the future.  Yes, \\"Revolver\\" did that too for its time, and it might track-for-track be the better album, but \\"Revolver\\" did not become an institution like its successor did.  <br />It's an understatement to say that \\"Sgt.Pepper\\" was \\"a milestone for 60s music and popular culture\\".  We're talking about an album that changed album packaging and presentation, lyrics, <BR>studio techniques, drug-taking, clothes, hair, philosophies of life and ways of living for untold millions (and if you were already well into the hippie scene, it confirmed and consolidated your best acid trips and then some...quite simply, no-one had heard anything like \\"A Day In The Life\\".  NO-ONE).  The Beatles were temporarily erected to the status of Gods On High by every listener under the age of 30 on the planet (if you think Beatle-worship is intense *now*, you should have been there *then*, when Timothy Leary called them \\"new laughing messiahs\\" and played \\"Sgt.Pepper\\" during his lectures).  Musicologists and professors were dumbfounded by the album's quality and some even insisted that the album was actually made by a group of white-coated scientists in a think-tank (they were obviously out to lunch when \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" were released).  And then, of course, there were the dozens upon dozens of \\"Pepper\\" imitations that poured out of the hippie scene in 67/68, many of them quite good.  That the album continues to top polls 36 years later when so many other big albums have fallen by the wayside also speaks to its enduringquality and influence.  <br />Put simply, it really doesn't matter what each one of us personally thinks of the record.  Its impact then and now far transcends any and all minor gripes about individual songs, or comparisons to other Beatle albums.  \\"Pepper\\" took the Beatles from incredibly popular teenybop superstars to the realm of legend and myth.  Most of us born after the band broke up simply have no idea how the album changed the world, because they grew up in a world already changed by it.  Those of us under 35 have no idea how restrictive and unimaginative pop culture was before The Beatles took everything into technicolor.  But, as an exercise, just try to imagine the world without \\"Pepper\\", or go look up the kind of music, movies and styles that were popular before its release (with a few late '66/'67 releases like \\"Revolver\\", \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" and \\"Are You Experienced?\\" excluded).  If that's not enlightening, I can't help you!

B0000DJZAH|5.0|I was perfectly happy with the 1996 remix/remaster until this came along.  Although the original album libretto is not included (everyone who buys this should own the original vinyl anyway), this is &quot;Tommy&quot; presented, perhaps for the first time, <BR>the way it should have been all along.  As others have mentioned, the sound quality here is stunning; it's a different remix than the '96 one, but even sharper and clearer, with an overall sound that is loud, punchy and direct rather than timid and muffled.  The bonus tracks are also quite interesting--many having never seen the light of day before--although more of Pete's original demos should have been included (esp the original, psychedelic take of &quot;Amazing Journey&quot;, with much more backwards instrumentation).  Still, there's enough here to please most archivists.  The second disc is worth it for &quot;Trying To Get Through&quot; alone, an outtake that even in its rough studio form sounds as rocking as anything else that made the cut.  <br />Overall, those with SACD players will be getting a rare treat, and even those with normal stereo systems will still be hearing by far the best-sounding version of this album ever made available.  That the now half-deaf Townshend could come up with such a definitive take on his most important statement is a minor miracle in itself.  While the definitive &quot;Tommy&quot; remains the live version captured on the 69/70 tour (and available on the deluxe &quot;Leeds&quot; and &quot;Isle Of Wight&quot; CDs), the original album's stature has now been newly redeemed.  Time has not dimmed its complexity and relevance one bit, as the socio/psychological/spiritual implications are still hotly debated among fans, critics and other observers today.
B0000D14JV|4.0|I thought this would be a silly movie, but I actually enjoyed it. It has a lot of funny moments that adults and teens can enjoy.
B00005ASHM|4.0|Count me in among those who simply never \\"got\\" this album.  Or, at least, never \\"got\\" it like those Mojo critics who voted it in as the greatest album of all time, or the RS panel which put it at #2.  It's good, yes, but a magically mystically transcendent and Shakespearian-worthy reflection of the human condition?  Hmmm...many of the tracks seem overly-sweetened to these ears, especially \\"You Still Believe In Me\\", \\"I'm Waiting For The Day\\", \\"Here Today\\"...the chamber orchestration applied to \\"God Only Knows\\" still works, largely because the melody is so timeless; along with \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", the title track and \\"Caroline No\\" it's the best thing on the disc.  Wilson's lyrics are OK and certainly more sophisticated than anything The Beach Boys and most other pop acts were capable of in the spring of '66, but even the best here (\\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\", \\"Caroline No\\") are written from an overly-sentimental perspective.  Oddly enough, though, I enjoy \\"Don't Talk\\" in spite of--or maybe even because--it's a simple romantic ballad (the repetition of the chorus at the end creeps up on me and sends shivers down the spine).<br />\\"Pet Sounds\\" never *truly* grabbed me until I heard the stereo version prepared for the box set, and which is included here.  This version brings out the album's delicate arrangements much more, and to me is the only \\"true\\" version (I expect a lot of disagreement here, of course).  Anyways, I've listened to and pondered its worth dozens and dozens of times, hoping that eventually something would magically \\"click\\" and I'd be enlightened, which is how a lot of people have described their coming to love the album.  With me, though, it has been more of a gradual appreciation--a lyric here, an instrument there, and especially hearing the stereo version--than a sudden impulse to erect a Brian Wilson shrine in my bedroom.  I've heard the \\"Smile\\" material on boots and it is the wacky, wildly experimental stuff there which seems more like what I'd expected of \\"Pet Sounds\\".  Still, I would recommend the album to anyone who hasn't heard it, for it is still an essential work in the history of rock, albeit slightly saccarine and sentimental in places.  For heartfelt lyricism and stunning arrangements without dross like \\"Sloop John B\\", I'd recommend \\"Rubber Soul\\", Robert Wyatt's \\"Rock Bottom\\", Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\" or The Kinks' \\"Village Green Preservation Society\\" instead.

B00008973Q|5.0|...story tellers, yes if there was one movie director who accepted his job as a mare story teller instead of a &quot;movie director&quot;, it is the grand old man of the east, Akira Kurosawa.<br />Kurosawa is a story teller, painter, musician, statesman, and a warrior... So, when you're watching &quot;Ran&quot; every still shot moving shot and close-up could be a painting on its on right, the sound--from battles to the haunting flute conveys the nihilistic message of the film... and Kurosawa tells you the story of politics, and he depicts battles like no-one else ever comes close to... <br />\\"Ran\\" is not an artsy film, nor it is a mindless Hollywood action movie, and off course it is not an \\"over-done Shakespeare\\" as well. Watch this movie with an open mind, and remember that a grand old man is telling you a story.<br />This is all I can say about Akira Kurosawa and his last epic &quot;Ran&quot;... a masterpiece.
B0000CFW87|1.0|I was disgusted when I listened to this cd.  It was even more horrible when I saw all the good ratings this cd got.  This cd is just some kid singing opera and other boring songs.  If you wasnt to listen to good music I recomend you look just about any where else
B000002UZ1|5.0|I'm Writing this review because of a bad review of this CD that claimed: <BR>&quot;Were the Beatles original? I don't believe so, their music is so trite. So copied. <BR>Who did they copy? no one during the sixities even sounded like the beatles. Until alot of people who came afterward tried to sound like them. Maybe you should check original release dates? And they also claimed that cookie cutter artist avril lavine is better, please! this is about as good as when my teenage sister used to say that hanson, nsync, and mc hammer were better too. Come back when avril lavine is still selling a good amount of records and can still have a number 1 seller 40 years after she was originally released. As matter of fact how about over 20 number 1 hits and over 40 top 5 hits in a six year period competing against artists that are in the same league as the once future legends rolling stones, the who, elvis, the beach boys, bob dylan, the doors, jimi hendrix, janis joplin, eric claptin etc.<br />And don't try pawn me as some old dude that hates new stuff, because I am barely out of high school.
B000007T2Z|1.0|I was enticed by the words of the others but it is just plain bad. I really like lift your skinny fists... but this album is a waste of time and money. I enjoy what they do when they do it, but there is a total of maybe 5 minutes of good stuff spread out amongst 40 minutes of wailing and some guy talking- who cares? This CD is BOGUS, please do not get fooled like I was.
B0000CESUM|3.0|This might give you a taste of some classic Def Leppard tracks, but do yourself a favor and go for the full course meal. This compilation brings in more of their recent hits, which are okay (although they seem addicted to ballads lately) but High 'n' Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria have too many overlooked, yet brilliant tunes to forget. Spend a little more for these three albums and get some great early-mid 80s rock!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is one great CD!!!<BR>Since I've always hated Britney, I never bought the CD until I listened to my friend's. I loved it at once and asked her whether she'd lend it to me but she said she can't stay a day without listening to it. I bought it and I don't regret it.<BR>One-star reviewers are missing it all out because they obviously haven't listened to it. <BR>This is a great dance CD and I actually liked Everytime. I can't stand ballads but I love this one and I do hope Justin listens to it. I know Britney did one one him but she's sorry now.<BR>I can't imagine she wrote the lyrics because I always pictured her to be this dumb blonde. She's great and got talent. She's an awesome entertainer and I love all her new songs.<BR>I guess Britney manages somehow to capture fans and anti-fans through this album. I'm definately a fan now and I'm gonna stay in the zone.<BR>It is not a waste of maney and whoever said it was are just trying to bring down a good album because they're jealous of how successful it became.

B0000DZEA1|5.0|How do you write about one of the greatest composers of our time?  Howard Shore has captured the best of the themes, enhanced some beyond what I thought possible, and even created yet more themes for us to love and hum in our dark moments.  If I ever have the privilege to meet this man, I will have to thank him for the last three years of music and kiss him for the beauty that this trilogy is.  Howard, you've done it again!

That's the situation facing Travis, who deals with his loss by starting over--literally, tracing his life back to the place where he was conceived.  As the story unfolds, Travis realizes that you can't always get everything back...but sometimes, if you're willing to pay the price, you can make up for past mistakes.<br />     It's not a flashy movie.  But if you have the patience to sit and watch it, you'll be left with a feeling of being overwhelmed by the quiet drama of life that the movie holds.  I hope it comes out on DVD soon.  And that music...wow.
0767836324|5.0|This is poosibly the greatest film of all time. I loved it as a kid and rediscovered its greatness now, as a teenager. I am a huge fan of all things Peter Pan, and this definitely includes Hook. Everything is fantisticly done. I for one, love the Neverland aspect of the movie and find the Lost Boys (not to mention Rufio, Rufio, RU-FI-000O!!!) greatly entertaining. The review trashing the little kids in the movie is nonsense. These are kids, we're talking about. They did an excellent job and they are all extremely funny. The actors all do such a magnificent job, as well as the writers. My friends, family, and I all have inside jokes that include lines from the movie. Some classic lines: <BR>Jack: Bad form!<BR>Lost boy: Man stop!<br />and this one:<BR>Peter:He really did lose his marbles.<BR>Lost Boy(I forget his name -ahh): Yeah, he lost 'em good.<BR>There are so many funny and unforgettable lines, I can't even begin to post them.<BR>So to everyone who purchases this film, BANGARANG!!<BR>And to those who don't, BAD FORM!
1573301051|5.0|VH1 had decided to put together a benefit concert that was to help raise the money for the Save The Music Foundation. In 1998, they had their first charity concert entitled, \\"VH1 Divas Live '98\\". They have chosen five female solo acts to perform in this concert. Those five women are: Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan, Aretha Franklin, Shania Twain, & Mariah Carey. Carole King was also invited to this concert, but only as a guest diva. These five women helped redefine the meaning of listening to music and it is all defined right here.        Mariah Carey is the first two perform. She comes out, wearing a beautiful white sparkling gown, and performs, \\"My All\\". Just as the song nears the end, the song goes into a dance remix, where Mariah closes out the song. After \\"My All\\", Mariah then sings, \\"Make it Happen\\", a song that she had written about how she made it to where she is now.         Gloria Estefan then takes the stage, wearing a longer silver gown. Gloria sings \\"Heaven's What I Feel\\", the first single off her 1998 dance-fused album, \\"Gloria\\". After \\"Heaven's What I Feel\\", Gloria then sings, \\"Turn The Beat Around\\". After those two brilliant songs, Gloria performs an awesome Megamix Medley. The medley consists of, \\"Dr. Beat\\", \\"Conga\\", \\"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\\", \\"1-2-3\\", & \\"Get On Your Feet\\".        Shania Twain then takes the stage, wearing a black sparkling half-top and black pants. First, Shania sings, \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman\\". After that, she sits on a stool and, while playing an acoustic guitar, sings, \\"You're Still The One\\".        Aretha Franklin then takes the stage to perform, wearing a black party gown. Only, Aretha is not alone. Mariah Carey is with her. The two perform Aretha's hit song, \\"Chain Of Fools\\" and they sing it brilliantly.        Celine Dion comes out to the stage, wearing a black suit and black coat. She is joined by Carole King, where they sing Celine Dion's song, \\"The Reason\\". Carole King leaves the stage after, \\"The Reason\\", where Celine performs, \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\", followed by, \\"My Heart Will Go On\\".         A piano is wheeled out. Playing the piano is Carole King. Leaning on the side of the piano is Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan, & Shania Twain. The three sing, \\"You've Got A Friend\\". Carole not only plays the piano, but sings with Celine, Gloria, & Shania. For the finale, Celine, Gloria, Aretha, Shania, Mariah, & Carole take center stage to perform, \\"(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman\\" and \\"Testimony\\".         These women gave one hell of a concert, proving that they are Divas. I just hope that for the divas of 2005, they'll choose: Madonna, Roberta Flack, Toni Braxton, Taylor Dayne, Melissa Etheridge, & Annie Lennox. The whole selist for VH1 Divas Live '98 and the Divas of '98 line-up are listed below:    The Divas of '98    Celine Dion    Gloria Estefan    Aretha Franklin    Shania Twain    Mariah Carey    Carole King (guest diva)    VH1 Divas Live '98 setlist:    MARIAH CAREY    -My All    -Make It Happen    GLORIA ESTEFAN    -Heaven's What I Feel    -Turn The Beat Around    -(Megamix Medley) Dr. Beat/Conga/Rhythm Is Gonna Get You/1-2-3/Get On Your Feet    SHANIA TWAIN    -Man!

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This album continues in the tradition of the previous one of just being solid, good rock. I highly recommend this album to anyone who has any taste in music whatsoever. The strokes continue to create very simple yet amazing songs. Buy this and you will not be dissapointed.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This is the Best Live Concert CD and DVD I have ever heard !!. The powerful performances by ALL of George's Loved Ones could not be better!!! I miss his voice on the songs... but his Spirit Lives On and His Presence is felt in this Amazing Tribute.
B000069HK2|3.0|This cd is definitely good.  if you don't own it, consider burning it but i don't know if i'd run out and buy it.  there are some good songs to it, and singer Burt Mckrakin is a very good singer!  his style is one of his own, and that makes them stand out, yet i don't think the cd stands out as much.  there are some good songs, but i'll stick to my finch and TBS.
0688163173|5.0|Lehane will take you on a magical mistery tour this time. Enjoy the trip while you can because this will lead to a \\"bad trip\\" for sure!<br />While Teddy gets to the Shutter Island, you start to think that there is a big brother watching him everywhere (is there? is he ever getting paranoind?). As Teddy's truth is the only truth you have all over the book (until THAT twisting final), you start to ask yourself who is really the criminally insane after all (The \\"patients\\"? The staff? The marshalls themselves? Are you getting insane with them? Or Lehane - Well, after reading the book the sensation is that Lehane deserves a Pulitzer, and then, be sent immediately to Asheciliffe as DANNIEL SHEEN...). And going back to the 50's, start thinking about your average prozac as \\"radical aproaches\\", and lobotomies, as usual procedures...<br />This is an Orwell's 1984 with the difference you can't tell if big brother exists outiside the nutters heads (and your own, even after turning over the last page - so, does that make you a nutter?). Is it about deception or redemption? Or both? Who's the bad guy here (is there really one)?<br />This book will leave you with more questions after reading it then before. Not questions about the story,no, no. The type of questioning you do after going trough a nervous breakdown and surviving it. The type of questioning Teddy would do to himself. And that's what make this book HUGE. As said all over the book: \\"You can leave Shutter Island, but Shutter Island will never leave you\\"
B000099T2L|4.0|Although this is no Destiny's Child, Beyonce proves her own style and charisma can work in full effect. But what is up with some of these reviews? People saying she can't sing, clearly they haven't listened to this elbum enough to hear her genuine voice stand out in each track. Either upbeat dance grooves or soft sultry ballads Beyonce proves she can without a doubt release a solo as powerful and impacting as Destiny's Child did. Although the second half of the CD is a bit dull and too over populated with spirit lifting ballads, Beyonce shows she can sing to crazy beats and to beatiful ballads like 'Daddy&quot; and 'Yes'. Many bought the album expecting every song to be something like 'Crazy In Love' or 'Baby Boy'. Thats something you can never expect from an artist to have infectious dance beats over and over and over again. Beyonce could've made no other decision than add amazing ballads to go with her amazing genuine voice. So I don't want to hear from anyone that this girl has no talent or cant sing, because obviously you are not digging below the roots on this album. This was the best solo effort Beyonce could have ever brewed up from the recording studios, and it worked like a charm.
B00008PW2D|4.0|I know that the 5th season was definitely not great.  But you have to remember that both Sarah and Cynthia were pregnant and there were probably not that many normal story lines they could do.  However, I feel that Charlette's character really grows in this season as well as Samantha's.  I am a huge fan of Sex and the City and not every show is going to be great.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|It was good that Alicia Keys took a break after her first hugely succesful debut Songs In A Minor to really focus on her music. Unlike other artists who rush to maintain thier fame by making another album too quickly fail miserably. Alicia Key's put time and effort into her sophmore effort and it really shows that she can keep the same spark she once had. Her first single, You Dont Know My Name, is one of my favorites and I love it how Alicia is talking into the phone. My other favorite song is Dragondays which Alicia Keys wrote and its an excellent song. This album is still full of the soul she once had but with a more mature and complete manner. Alicia's voice seems more clear and better to me which is good because its amazing to hear her belt out those rapturing sounds along with the beauty of a piano by her side in nearly every song. I hope Alicia's third doesn't fail to ingnite the flames of soul and R&amp;B but who knows, third times the charm.
0385504209|5.0|I just finished reading this book, after having read source texts by Laurence Gardiner (Blood Line of the Holy Grail, and others) as well as the Holy Blood, Holy Grail text mentioned within Mr. Brown's book.  The DaVinci Code clearly lays out many of the fact-based arguments made by Gardiner and others, however Brown blurs the line between fact and fiction, and doesn't indicate where one ends and the other begins.  Not being a Grail Historian, symbologist, Mason, Priory member or other such &quot;scholar&quot;, and just a cynical christian looking for more information than any Church provides, I found this work enlightening, as it more clearly conveys the &quot;truth behind the lies&quot; that have taken over christianity as we know it today.
038533558X|5.0|Briefly, one of the best thrillers I have read in a long time.  After reading several different 'legal eagle' books, I saw &quot;Gone for Good&quot; on Amazon and decided to order.  A friend introduced me to Harlen Coben novels and this one met all expectations. I couldn't wait to finish a task so I could pick up where I left off.  The plot, characters, setting was superb, but what kept you wanting more were the unexpected twists of the story.  Just when you thought you had everything figured out, you realized you didn't.  Excellent reading; buy and enjoy.  This is a book you'll want to share with others.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|&quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot; is one of those real gems -- you get one every five or ten years, a Christmas movie that defines that moment in time and becomes a holiday favorite like &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; and &quot;A Christms Story&quot; before it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles from the previous two &quot;Vacation&quot; movies and decide this time to stay home and have an old-fashioned family Christmas. This would not be the Griswold family, of course, if everything didn't go wrong.<br />The only thing disappointing about this DVD set is that Warner Brothers has the nerve to label it a &quot;Special Edition.&quot; While it's certainly a step up from the barebones fullscreen DVD released a couple of years ago, there's still not much here. The only special features are the trailer and a commentary track that doesn't even include Chevy Chase. (C'mon, what's he got to do these days that he's too busy to record a commentary?) This would be an okay DVD release, but it's certainly not &quot;special.&quot; Still, it's likely to be the best we'll get, and since I avoided the previous release, I picked this one up because I do love the movie.
B000002KCC|5.0|Neil Young put his heart and soul on this album. You can feel the pain and sorrow he felt at the time of recording this. The death of two of his friends are the theme of this emotional album. Even if you are a casual Neil Young fan, you should have this album. Not a bad song is on the disc. I had heard that when Neil turned this album into his label, they rejected it for being to dark and disturbing. If that is true those people should not have been in the music industry. It is those reasons that make this the classic that it is. This is not for people who like a little happy face on all the music they listen to. This is raw and real. Simply put, a classic.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I will keep my review short and open-minded. This Album is beautiful, sensual and very  \\"Enigma cool\\". The title for this album is well chosen and appropriate as it feels like an atmospheric trip in the world of Enigma. Once more Enigma hasn't disappointed me. Well done!
B0000TB01Y|4.0|After months of anticipation for this CD, I can tell you it is well worth the wait. The show opens powerfully and haunting lending a perfect setting for the rest of the show. As each number on the CD Player increases, the jaw drops farther and farther. The premice of the story is one in a million and is easially followed throughout Schwartz's score (without giving things away). There are certainly high points, such as the fabulous &quot;The Wizard and I&quot;, the breath-taking &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; and the heart warming &quot;For Good&quot; This CD will surely stay in the CD player for a long while, and even though its is said to be too &quot;rock-like&quot; of a score this is the new broadway-style that Schwartz has created (filled with rock, pop, and folk-like numbers) and it is one that will go down in history. A sure hit, dont miss it!
6302227127|5.0|THE BISHOP'S WIFE is a thoroughly charming movie about an \\"angel\\" (Cary Grant) who changes the life of a bishop (David Niven) who at Christmas time is trying desperately to raise funds to build an elaborate cathedral and has consequently neglected his wife, Julia (Loretta Young).  The three leads give beautiful performances, and there is a wonderful supporting cast, including Monty Woolley as a kindly if doubting professor and James Gleason as a loveable cab driver.  The screenplay is subtle, as is the musical score.  The scene near the end of the film in which Grant, Young, and Gleason take time out for some ice skating is a delightful respite, very much like a number in a movie musical.  THE BISHOP'S WIFE is a relatively recent addition to my video library, but it has quickly become my favorite classic Christmas movie -- next to MIRACLE ON 34th STREET and Alastair Sim's A CHRISTMAS CAROL, that is.
B00005JLSE|4.0|You can watch this movie over and over again and still love every second of it! The music is sensational and the dance #'s are really great! When I first watched this movie I didn't think it would have a good plot to it, but I was definitely wrong about that! It is a great movie and a good buy for anyone who loves musicals!<BR>**Check it out!**
B00005JLEU|5.0|More than a good animation movie, &quot;Spirited away&quot; is a good movie, period. It's the fantastic story about Chihiro, a little girl that discovers a wonderful and fabled, yet dangerous, world, and her quest to go back unharmed to her own world. It seems to me unappropriate to try to tell something of the plot of the story here, because it would be inaccurate and, most of all, this movie is to be watched, not explained. It has to be watched because it's one of the most sensitive and immaginative works of fiction in recent years.<br />My only complaint (a complaint to myself, of course) is that, while watching the movie, I felt I couldn't absorb (or fully understand) most of what I was seeing simply because I'm not that much acquainted with japanese culture. Every scene, every character, every situation, every color, every setting has an specific and aproppriate meaning, both within the story and within japanese culture, and that misterious aura was, to me, one of the best features of the film.<br />Great entertainment, and well-deserved praises.<br />Grade 9.3/10
B00008IHN1|5.0|This movie is fantastic! The scenes with all of the drum action is awesome! It sounds really neat and it has a really good plot to it! I love this movie so much I had to buy it for myself and I've watched it about 10 times since I've bought it! I recommend this to anyone!<BR>***Check it out!!***
B000001FMX|2.0|I write this review as an original fan of the NY Dolls from 30 years ago (even saw them live in '74 at the Joint in the Woods in New Jersey when they showed up an hour late, and too wasted to play.) Bought their first and second albums after reading about them in Rolling Stone magazine, 'cause even the progressive FM radio stations in N.Y. (like W-NEW) wouldn't play them. Loved their glitter rock punk Stonish image (it was all about image back then) but stopped playing the album after 4 or 5 spins. Guess it was because none of the songs (except &quot;Personality Crisis&quot; and &quot;Looking for a Kiss&quot;) really stuck with me. I still have the original vinyl that I'm sure wasn't played more than a half dozen times if anyone wants to buy it. Ran into David Johansenn a couple times in Woodstock N.Y. over the years (he likes to shop in this art supply store), and he likes to forget about the Dolls days. My advise is buy this only if you're a collector of old rock albums. (The NY Dolls definitely influenced Aerosmith, who were smart enough to stick it out and rake in the bucks, and Motley Crue a decade later.) But as far as listening to this over and over, I don't think so.
6305364613|4.0|This brillant and contemporary retelling of the world's most tragic love affair makes this wildly inventive &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; unforgettable. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes portray Romeo and Juliet, the youthful star-crossed lovers of the past. But the setting has been moved from its Elizabethan orgins to the futuristic urban backdrop of Verona Beach. <br />This movie is great and it overall a really good buy for anyone!!<BR>***Check it out!***
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Only two artists can boast 27 #1 hits: Elvis Presley and the all-time greats: the Beatles. This comprehensive album of all eight years of the Beatles career covers the Beatles' greatest songs through the charts. Despite bad criticism, all the best songs are on here. Perhaps the album would have been better with Strawberry Fields Forever and Please Please Me, but the album by itself is fantastic for anyone.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely magnificient. It is the best film ever made and the music could have easily ruined it. But thanks to Howard Shore, it didn't. He made damn sure of that.<BR>If you're in to this kind of music then make it a priority to buy this. I was a pure hip-hop fan until I watched these films and fell in love with both, the music and the films. There is only one small hiccup, there was some beautiful music which I heard on the trailer, that wasn't included in the CD. Nearly all of it actually.<br />Can somebody tell me if this is the full version of the whole soundtrack, or was that music from the trailer just not included.<br />Peace out.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|This was an amazing sound track. Billy Boyd what a suprise, he has a great voice. This is not the best Howard has ever done but it was very good never the less. I never liked music like this before but i heard it was good so i bought it, i loved it so much i had to buy the other 2. after listing to it Howard rehashed almost all of my favorite themes, the Rohan theme is lovely but he changed it (but he had to for the new movie). However it was done very artisticly therefore i accepeted it with good grace. this is a must have for all music fans. Once again Howard shows the music world what a great composer he is with this masterpeice. Howard I salute you on a job well done.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|WHY CAN'T PEOPLE JUST TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS CD. i noticed that it's all the ardent &quot;come-hell-or-fury-i- will-be-a-sarah-Lackie&quot; type fans that are giving this cd 5 star ratings.<br />Oh please ! enough of the charade. <br />You wanna know the truth about this cd. <br />IT BLOWS! <br />Do you wonder why so many fans are giving it one star, Gee I wonder why! <br />I'm mad as hell for 40 minutes of mediocre nothing! And what really pissed me off is that I can't get a refund because i opened the package.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|Only 2 years ago in 2001, new soul singer Alicia Keys dropped on the scene. Having a number 1 single and multi-platinum album, Sweeping the Grammies, she was on top of the world! Now its 2 years later, and Alicia is back, with her sophmore album &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot;. The first single from the album is the stunning &quot;You dont know my name&quot;, which is an amazing song, which is heating up the charts. The album is fantastic, In my opinion, Alicia has topped her debut album.  Alicia makes some changes &quot;The Diary Of...&quot;, adding a more hip hop flavor such as on the songs &quot;Karma&quot;, and &quot;Heartburn&quot;, and it works successfully. Ofcourse Alicia sitll keeps her signature soul driven piano ballads, which are always beautiful and heartwarming. Alicia is such a talented woman, and truely does deserve all the success she gets!<br />So, if you are looking for a delightful soulful album, you must pick up &quot;The Diary Of Alicia Keys&quot;.
0784011680|2.0|I can't understand why directors are drawn to biopics. They never seem to rise above the level of a better-than-average TV miniseries. And they generally gravitate to one extreme or the other: either the subject was a monster or a saint. Attenborough's Chaplin is in the latter category. At times it even seems like an apologia for the often maligned Chaplin, who some biographers accuse of misogynism, communism, and various sexual perversities. In contrast, Attenborough depicts Chaplin as an artist-hero who was highly principled but slightly flawed in his personal life. I admire Chaplin as an artist and even (with reservations) as a person.  I could have tolerated a more balanced depiction of this brilliant man. It would have made for a much better movie.  <br />Robert Downey is a remarkable Chaplin, although he misses out on the sweetness that Chaplin could convey on screen. His imitation of Chaplin's other mannerisms is excellent. As an old man, the heavily made-up Downey eerily resembles a miniature Jabba the Hut. The primary purpose of the many supporting characters is to serve as foils to the greater glory of Chaplin, proving somewhat repetitiously that Chaplin was a man of deep principles and unbounded genius. Thus, these characters have little depth and aren't very interesting. The exception is Kevin Klein as Douglas Fairbanks. He contributes a nuanced and moving portrayal of the young vital Doug and, later, the old decaying Doug. <br />A final cavil: over the closing credits, we are informed how things turn out for the many supporting characters in this drama. The writers could apparently not resist the temptation to give Chaplin's enemies their just desserts. Thus, we are told that the \\"bad\\" characters (e.g., Joan and Mildred) end up in mental hospitals or dying through dissolution. Unfortunately, the actress Mabel Normand is placed in this category. As the movie depicts it, her inconsequential talents are contrasted against Chaplin's genius. It saddens me that the makers of Chaplin felt obliged to depict this remarkable woman in such a negative light. And in a final insult to Normand, her closing note dismissively states that she never made another movie after the murder of her alleged lover, William Desmond Taylor, in the early 1920s. This is inaccurate. Normand actually made several shorts for Hal Roach later in the decade, struggling without success to make a comeback before finally succumbing to tuberculosis.
0380002930|5.0|No doubt, Richard Adams planned to write this book as a story to his little children, but what came out is one of the most astonishing and imaginative tales I've ever read. In my opinion, what Tolkien did with hobbits, dwarves, men and elves, Richard Adams has done with rabbits.<br />At first glance, the reader may think: but what's there about rabbits that's so interesting? Of course, \\"Watership down\\" is not just about rabbits at all. Adams only used them as an allegory. But it's been really interesting reading about semi-sentient beings that are not distinguished by their intelligence, but by their tenacious will to survive against stronger enemies and sometimes even against themselves. More than that, Adams was able to create (like Tolkien) a spiritual, holy background for rabbits, permeating his story with nice tales about a smarter-than-most rabbit that lived in ancient times.<br />Richard Adams tells his tale like an old-fashioned myth, like a folded piece of clothing that the reader has to unfold and never stop being amazed by its size and complexity.<br />Grade 9.5/10

B00012QM9K|5.0|After seeing recent films like LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and THE PIANIST, I still have to say that the definitive Holocaust film, if such a thing exists, is SCHINDLER'S LIST.<br />Steven Spielberg, already the most commercially-successful director of all-time, rises to the level of a master storyteller by making numerous brilliant choices.  The first: by telling this story through the amoral Oskar Schindler, a German profiteer, Spielberg delves into the complexities of evil, especially in the scenes between Schindler and the frightening camp commandant, Goerthe (played with chilling precision by Ralph Fiennes).  The black and white photography, everything--it all works.<br />Many moments still come to mind: the little girl in the red coat, the documentary look and feel of the gunshots, the dreadful looks of realization on the faces of people as ashes snow down on them, the haunting final scenes.<br />The refrain of the survivors has been, \\"Never Again.\\"  The lasting impact of Spielberg's film will be, \\"Never Forget.\\"
B0000074BS|5.0|I'll keep it short.  I bought the TAPE in 1986 in Kodiak Alaska as a blind purchase.  I was really lucky.  I have been listing for 17 years now and needed to replace the tape with the CD.  You won't be disapointed.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Considering they use puppets and old time FX this is one of the BEST films i have ever seen. Watch it and watch it its music never dies  and its plot never fails you should buy it it is a GREAT movie!!!!! Have Fun!!!!
B000002LCE|4.0|Dream Evil, even though it features a new guitarist in the form of Craig Goldy, is a (for the most part) excellent  album. Craig's guitar style is more fluid than the raunchier style of Vivian Campbell (who later sold out totally). There are even some riffs that recall Dio's former band with Ritchie Blackmore, Rainbow.<br />Its an essential purchase for Dio fans (and the keyboards give it an extra atmospheric kick) though not without its flaws. &quot;I Could Have Been A Dreamer&quot; is the most flaccid song Dio has ever done, veering very closely to Pop Metal. The production is a bit thin, and I also notice Dio's vocals are slightly distorted (If any album is in a need of a remastering its definitely this one). However, given that, the Elven one gave us another gem in spite of the obstacles.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Get Born has some of the best music i've heard ever. Jet is definitely a band worth keeping track of. Their use of rockish beats and poppy melodies make you want to get up and just dance...even if it is rock. This is one of those few rock CDs that have be released in the last...20 years, that have that noticable touch...Get Born is definitely a must-have, especially before it becomes 13.99 &amp; 14.99. Jet will become something beyond what we can imagine.
0694003611|5.0|I've been reading this book to my daughter for 2 years and it's wonderful.  The psychological effect of this book is so great that I cannot hardly stay awake myself.  I'm yawning right now writing this review.  Great book!
B000053GTK|5.0|Originally released as an import only in 1973, its great to see it available again. Having seen them live in 1977, I can attest to their musical prowess. (They opened for Focus) They always were more of a &quot;live&quot; band; the studio was where they would &quot;sketch&quot;, then bring it to the canvas live. In A Glass House showed them at their experimental best; Inmate's Lullaby is all percussion instruments. They covered classical, jazz, medeival musical genres, mixed with rock and a touch of &quot;Beach Boys thrown in. No one did this better!
B00005JKCH|2.0|If you did not have spiderman poster at your bedroom when you were kid, you simply do not have good reason to love this movie.<BR>Sam Raimi had big budget, some reasonable actors (McGuire, Dunst and Defoe), cult superhero comic book as script base, but he created an absolute failure. Plot is laughable and very childish, characters are unbelievable and what is most important, it lacks any kind of special graphic novel &quot;environment&quot;. Instead it is just boring teenage action movie. However, as it had huge success among critics and in box office, producers probably decided that there is no need for any improvement and made even worse one - Daredevil. I bet Spiderman 2 will not be any better, so I suggest to forget about franchise and enjoy GOOD comic book adaptations like - BATMAN,X-MEN or BLADE.
B000000P17|4.0|This is a well-done collection of covers from punk and neo-punk bands of the 70's and 80's.  Most are well done, but one track stands so far above the rest that, for me, this is a &quot;one song CD.&quot;  And that is &quot;Ain't it Fun?&quot;, a remake of the Dead Boys 1979 original.  The GNR version is quite simply one of the best rock singles ever made.  Great guitar intro. Axel's tortured vocals capture punk nihilistic angst perfectly.  Listen to it as you're getting ready to go out and party.  You'll have a great night! (BTW, there is a CD single out for this, so if you find it, you could skip the rest...)
B0000TB05A|5.0|I have seen various reviews on this DVD, and as a U2 fan I own all of their concerts from the beginning. I instantly bought this one, no matter what the reviews said. I've decided to write my own review because of the fact that as far as I like U2, I want to be objective regarding their work, and we all know that they had some bad editions. I will rate this DVD simply as a MUST HAVE regardless if you are U2 fan or not. Once you've listened to first couple of songs, fan or not, you will love them.<br />Concert itself<BR>The concert is something that I haven't seen in a long time. I remembered the times where the band recorded Rattle and Ham and after that Achtung Baby, how the concerts from those tours were filled with energy, spontaneous interaction of the band with the audience, performance that simply makes you shiver. I had the exact feeling when I watched the band in front of a huge audience, the guys are giving the maximum, and Bono's interaction with the audience is amazing. With the excellent performance, the relaxed atmosphere, stories from the past, and with excellent performance of their first single Out Of Control, the band managed to awake the spirit from the past that was long gone, lost and forgotten.<BR>Conclusion? Go for this one!!!<br />If you still don't get the full picture about this DVD, you can read the next couple of paragraphs regarding the technical details of this edition<br />Content<BR>The DVD comes in paper cover, small illustrated inlay, with excellent quality and pictures. DVD itself contains the concert in Slane Castle, Mysterious Ways as bonus song which was left out of the concert part (strange but anyway they put it in), The Unforgettable Fire documentary about making of the concert is listed in &quot;extras&quot; where you can also find Elevation tour diary calendar and clock and couple of screen savers and themes for Windows. DVD ROM bonus tracks section contains three songs that can be viewed on PC in 360° using Quick Time Player (Elevation, Beautiful Day and Where The Streets Have No Name).<br />Sound<BR>Sound is recorded in PCM Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and finally DTS 5.1 format which makes this DVD the first DVD with DTS Sound released by U2. The sound quality is astonishing, if you listen in Dolby Digital 5.1 and especially in DTS, will simply become part of the audience, experiencing the full power this excellent concert. <br />Picture<BR>Like in other U2 concerts, these guys spend big time on visual effects and cameras recording the concert. The monitors are present, this time 4 big ones for each of them, and once again they use state of the art technology for their visual effects. Picture format is 16:9 wide screen with excellent quality.
B000002AGN|5.0|I can't add much to the 117 other reviews, but I will say that this is a must have for even those dubious to the world of jazz.  Buy this album.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Grandpa sings that line in the opening track &quot;Falling from above&quot;. Neil Young is likely singing about himself, as he does elsewhere on Greendale. Greendale is a case of Young reinventing, or &quot;retredding&quot;, himself yet again.<br />I had the good fortune to sit 10 rows from the front on the final date of the Greendale tour. Up until then I had all the criticisms that others are making of the album, but I sensed there was more to it. Yes it was repetitive vocally and musically (or droning to put use a negative word) in a number of songs but I had to remember he was telling a story. Some of the lines were extremely hokey (&quot;A little love and affection, in everything you do, will make the world a better place, with or without you&quot;) but he's always got away with his homespun philosophies. &quot;I've been a miner for a heart of gold&quot; is not exactly a fine piece of poetry when you really look at it, but people love it. You also have to remember that these are old fashioned country folk talking so they're not exactly going to quote Oscar Wilde. And there are some gems as well, such as Grandpa lamenting materialism &quot;When I was young people wore what they had on&quot;. Makes no sense but you know what he means and it says so much, thats one of the things that makes Neil Young great.<br />Anyway the concert put the story in context and illuminated much of the music. The music isn't really complete without the live performance, I don't think it was meant to be, so judging the album solely on the musical CD is not doing it justice. It is a concept after all, and a brave one, Young manages to pull it off beautifully.<br />Young does the music with Crazy Horse, minus Pancho Stampedro, (who gets an acknowledgement) which is a little disappointing because it does alter the sound. But its still interesting as you get a pared down Crazy Horse which highlights Youngs guitar playing even more, and he's playing as well as ever.<br />Some of the songscould easily sit on some of his classic albums. 'Falling from Above' is a great first thing in the morning song (like 'The Thrasher'), you can feel the town of Greendale waking up. 'Grandpa's Interview' is one of the few acoustic tracks, which the album could do with some more of, to balance things out. 'See the Rain' is one of those electric anthemic songs like 'Keep on Rockin' in the free World', which winds up the album well. I really enjoyed the bluesy feel of some of the songs and the sinister edge to 'Bandit' and 'Carmicheal' is almost new territory for Young if there is such a thing.<br />If you're after Harvest or After the Goldrush then stay away from this (but then you'd should know that you're not going to get what you expect or want from Neil Young anyway). If you're a fan of most of what you've heard then you can't be disappointed, its classic Young, but make sure you get the DVD and read the liner notes so you can absorb the story as well. If the concert hits the road again, see it, its inspiring. Many thought it concert of the year and given we had the Stones, Springsteen, Pearl Jam and the Red Hot Chilli Peppers all come to town, thats saying something.
B000003S2K|5.0|Ambient 1 is one of the best, and in a way, one of the most beautiful albums ever released.<BR>In the past, many people have tried to listen to and judge this album as some sort of pop accomplishment-Ambient 1, and for that matter, Brian Eno's Ambient Series is not meant to judged on a pop level. The Ambient works are meant to run in the background - so you could really consider this to be meditative music.<BR> <BR>-1/1 is simply astonishing - one of the best \\"ambient\\" compositions ever written. <br />-2/1 is a hauntingly beautiful piece which is driven by three voices.<br />-1/2 is a combination of the original piano scheme of 1/1, mixed with the haunting voices of 1/2.<br />-2/2 is the final track, and presents another eerily wonderful scheme, this time with only Brian playing a synthesizer.<br />As you listen to this album, track by track, you will be able to see how much of a wonder this album is.

0385504209|4.0|Burn it!  You can just hear the fanatical fundamentalists scream out their wrath against The Da Vinci Code. I imagine most Christians have a vague idea of the controversy surrounding this book and will steer clear. Too bad. The Da Vince Code will challenge you, irk you, and downright blow you off any safety net you have been holding on to.<br />Be prepared to have your theology whirl like Disney's Teacups. If you don't want the plot spoiled, quit reading now. Go give your brain something to do besides wondering if Jesus would want you to buy that new BMW. Buy the book.<br />Ok, Brown makes a very convincing argument that the Holy Grail is actually a symbol of Mary Magdelene, wife of Jesus! Yes, His wife!  and guess what ?  They had a kid. Brown fills his book with historical data, and assumes that the reader will swallow  the bait. Its almost a in your face &quot;you're an idiot unless you believe the author&quot; kind of approach. Very effective none the less. And there are quite a number of authors who agree with his Mr and Mrs Jesus idea. Most people won't bother to check his sources and that's scarey because they'll walk away believing every word. I did my homework.<br />  Brown bases his theory on the Gnostic gospels. He states that Christians banned any gospels that made any mention of Jesus being married. Huge problem sir. The four gospels in the Bible were written before 100AD. Even scholars who aren't Christians accept that premise. Also, the Gnostic gospels, on which Brown bases his ideas on, weren't written until after 100AD.<br />  Was the Church hiding the fact that Jesus was married? Lets say they were. There are a lot of non Christian writers who wrote about the life of Jesus. Josephus. Tacitus, Pliny.... They were all pagan. None of them accepted Jesus' claims to be God. But they did acknowledge that: Jesus was born in Bethleham, He had many followers, He did miraculous signs, He was crucified by Romans, and they mention that many of Jesus' followers claimed Jesus rose from the grave. NONE OF THEM MENTION THAT JESUS WAS MARRIED!. Of all people, these ancient pagan historians would surely mention a fact that Jesus was in fact married, especially if the Church was trying to cover it up.  Around 600 to 700 AD Muslim scholars brought ancient texts to life. They were some of the greatest scholars of their time. Jesus was and is an important figure in Islam.

B0000C9V3T|5.0|A-W-E-S-O-M-E...need I say more
B00006FR47|4.0|This was Chicago's first single disc album.  Maybe it was because there wasn't as much material to go through, but this was an extremely popular album in 1972.  Of course, \\"Saturday In The Park\\" was the summer hit of that year.  After all this time, that single is the only song that anyone would know from Chicago V.  But the actual record is better than that track record suggests.  \\"Hit By Varese\\", \\"All Is Well\\", and \\"Now That You've Gone\\" are strong Chicago material.  \\"Dialogue\\" is a piece of social commentary that actually works as a song.  You may not understand what the two singers are talking about.  Most of us didn't at the time; but it didn't stop millions from dancing to it.  Even as an instrumental, it is a fast paced, exciting piece of music.<br />\\"While The City Sleeps\\" and \\"State Of The Union\\" don't appeal on first listening but they do grow on you.  The last two cuts \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Alma Mater\\" have never struck me as good songs.  But to be fair, I know a lot of people who love \\"Alma Mater\\" as sort of a quiet favorite.<br />This was an important record in Chicago's career.  It is extremely listenable and is easier to get into than the series of double albums that characterized Chicago's output up to that point.  The joke on campus was that it was the perfect \\"make out\\" record for music majors in that they could put the record on, have sex, put their clothes back on, and listen to the remaining nine songs in comfort.  No.  The joke wasn't nice.  But Chicago was enormously popular among music majors at the time-which speaks of the high level of musicianship the band had.  Music majors also tended to view Chicago that was a band \\"for them\\" as it was one of the few places where their serious study of music and popular music met.<br />This Rhino edition includes three bonus cuts.  Of these, the radio/single edit version of \\"Dialogue\\" is of interest as a piece of history.
B00006RINF|5.0|Someone literally needs to march their ass to Times Square, New York; barge into the MTV building; and beat everyone up to a pulp.  Listen, I'm not saying this to be morbid, but MTV has completely ruined music for many innocent people, and for that, they should all have to suffer a terrible price. Their are actually people who think Lacuna Coil is an Evanescence rip-off! Look, the Coil have released four outstanding albums, while Evanescence has released one mediocre record, and gotten two videos on MTV.  But, alas, LC sounds NOTHING like Evanescence, and since this review is for them, I'll try to focus myself a little more for the remainder of it. <br />First off, this is the Coil's fourth album! While they've all impressed, Comalies expands on the band's ability to craft beautiful music while at the same time maintaining teamwork and dedication to their loyal fanbase. That's not to say that this is the best LC album, that's ultimately up to the listener, but it IS a step in the right direction.  The sound on here has expanded beyond the melodic heaviness of Unleashed Memories, and is obviously very different from In a Reverie. Actually, overall, this album has some moments that are actually quite heavier than the aforementioned titles, and moments that are very mellow and pleasing to the ears. What obviously stands out among the record is Cristina Scabbia's angelic and flexible voice, and her ability to switch off and on between a range of high and low voices (just listen to &quot;Heaven's A Lie&quot; for confirmation). She puts Amy Lee (Evanescence) to shame, that's definite. The male vocalist you hear is Andrea Ferro. A lot of people have criticized his voice but I think it's great. He captures a lot of emotions and carries them throughout each song, while at the same time managing to perform distinct and sharp growls on songs like &quot;Angel's Punishment&quot; (also listen to &quot;My Wings&quot; from In a Reverie). Adding to this, Marco Coti Zelati constructswonderful bass licks that are surprisingly audible, and drummer Cristiano Mozatti completes the rhythm section, offering a variety of percussion tempos and sounds. But if there's one thing that I'd complain about, it's the guitar work. It's mostly just riffs that sound alike on each song, and are often drowned out by Cristina and Andrea. But I have to give both guitarists credit for their acoustic performance on the short track &quot;Aeon&quot;, it sounds beautiful. To complete my review, even though I probably shouldn't, I'm going to review each song, one by one. <br />SWAMPED - This is a great opener, as it sets the mood for the album. Just hearing Cristina's voice in the chorus makes me want to listen to it again and again. 5/5<br />HEAVEN'S A LIE - The single off of the album. It took a few listens for me to catch on, but once I did, I was charmed by Cristina's low-key vocals. 5/5<br />DAYLIGHT DANCER - If I hadn't heard a clip of this track, I probably wouldn't have bought this album. This is probably my favorite tune. The keyboard work may seem corny, but it grew on me. Compliments to Andrea for getting the song to a good start and especially Cristina who brings some entrancing vocals to the table.  5.5/5<br />HUMANE - Out of all the songs on the album, this one took the longest to grow on me. It's a bit slower than the others, but it's still remarkable, especially the second half, where Cristina demonstrates some impressive vocal dynamics.  5/5<br />SELF DECEPTION - This song sounds a little more pop-influenced, but it adds some much-welcomed diversity into the album. 5/5<br />AEON - The only song that doesn't deserve a 5. It's good, but very short, and I can't help but thinking of it as a filler track, despite the breathtaking acoustic arrangements. 3/5<br />TIGHT ROPE - Starting off with a nice synthesizer intro, and then evolving into some heavy verses, followed by an angelic chorus, with the addition of some well-written lyrics, there's not enough wordsI can use to describe this masterpiece.  5.5/5<br />THE GHOST WOMAN &amp; THE HUNTER - Another slow tune, but after the ferocity of &quot;Tight Rope&quot;, I was welcoming it with open arms. 5/5<br />UNSPOKEN - This is Cristina's track. She performs ALL vocals on the song, elevating it to different heights until it all comes together for a spine-chilling chorus.  5.5/5<br />ENTWINED - Once again, the band slows things down, giving the listener the opportunity to concentrate on the beauty of the music. 5/5<br />THE PROPHET SAID - Most of the vocals are performed by Andre, which may turn off some people, but I still loved it. He gets his moments to show off his talent while Cristina sits in the background for the first half of the song. 5/5<br />ANGEL'S PUNISHMENT - Overall, this has got to be the heaviest song on the record. Just listen to Andrea's growling on the chorus and you'll know what I mean. During the first and second verse, Cristina speaks the lyrics in a rhythmic fashion, often saying words like &quot;war&quot; and &quot;destruction&quot;, and putting emphasis on the lyrics.  5.5/5<br />COMALIES - What a wonderful way to close a great album. While some of the lyrics are sung in Italian, it's so hard not to feel the emotions caught in this song. But my favorite part has to be the ending acoustics, providing a brilliant closure to the album.<BR>5/5<br />So, out of thirteen songs, only one recieved less than a five-star rating from me. Ultimately, it's YOUR decision whether you like this or not, but I truly mean everything I say, so consider this review in the future, and listen to a band with REAL talent that isn't MTV-manufactured.

B00008J4P5|4.0|&quot;Elephant&quot; by the White Stripes includes premium quality tracks mixed together with others that are solid but not superb.  &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; won listeners over with its deep bass line, thumping drums, roaring lead guitars, and the supportive screaming wail of the second guitars.  It kicks the album off nicely by featuring Jack White as the tough guy in the front of a loud rock and roll band.<br />Track 3, &quot;There's No Room For You Here&quot; is remotely reminiscient of Queen and Prince while being distinctly White Stipes.  The next track, &quot;I Just Don't Know What to do With Myself&quot; gets fantastically loud.<br />Track 5, &quot;In the Cold, Cold, Night&quot;, is sung softly, gently, and almost seductively by Meg White.  The piano in &quot;I Want to be the Boy to Warm your Mother's Heart&quot; supports the hopeful innocence in Jack's voice and lyrics on the track.  &quot;You've Got Her in Your Pocket&quot; is a mellow acoustic song with a sweet sound.  What follows is &quot;Ball &amp; Biscuit&quot;, the exceptional country/blues/rock track that almost steals the show for &quot;Elephant&quot;.  &quot;Ball &amp; Biscuit&quot; proves that the White Stripes are a band that can deliver a top-notch sound without stretching out of their reach.<br />The last song &quot;It's True That We Love One Another&quot; is always a pleasure to listen to.  It is fun, light-hearted, and folky.
B00005JKC3|3.0|This movie may have been a tad drawn out (i.e. flashback scenes with Bruce Banner/Dad), but it would have at least been bearable without all of the ridiculous split-screens and similar layouts that Ang Lee used in presenting this story. Had it been a one-screen movie throughout I would have given it a 7 or 8 out of 10, but as is I can only give it a 5 (if that) and I have loved Marvel Comics and all its characters for the past 28 years. I thought Marvel was going for realism (as real as a comic can be), and although I know that the Hulk is not the X-Men or Spider-Man, the &quot;realism&quot; seemed to vanish once the Hulk appears in this movie. The split-screens get so ridiculous, it makes you not take the story seriously, much less even able to pay attention with all of the excess flutter of NOTHING being thrown at you by trivial picture boxes and page turns. I applaud Ang Lee for having the guts to use a CGI Hulk, but to not even explain the PURPLE PANTS just makes this thing even more ridiculous. In my opinion, he basically made a real expensive joke ($137 million + $37 million marketing) that hardly paid for itself at the theatres. Thank god for loyal fans who will also pay for the DVD and kids who just love the character of the HULK and will buy the toys or they would have lost their *#S#* on this movie. PLEASE DON'T LET ANG LEE DIRECT ANOTHER MARVEL MOVIE!!!
6302891272|4.0|The black and white movie, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; is a successful remake of Shakespeare$B!G(Bs Macbeth. Instead of showing literal bloodiness as Polanski did, Kurosawa is able to express blood without using color. Washizu (Macbeth), with his violent character, is not afraid of murder. The bloodiness within Kurosawa$B!G(Bs movie is not visually seen but the cruelness of the couple, Washizu and Asaji (Lady Macbeth) reflects bloodiness. The audience is able to imagine the blood instead of seeing it. Many of the characters experience tragic deaths, including Washizu. However, Kurosawa also adopts Shakespeare$B!G(Bs technique to lighten up the scenes. Similar to Polanski$B!G(Bs version, torches deliver light to scenes. Polanski eliminates light in scenes with the three witches to emphasize darkness, but Kurosawa includes light in the scenes where Mononoke (the witch) takes part. Mononoke sits in unusual light in a deep dark forest. Mononoke still remains a mystery after viewing the film, yet the significance of the witches in Macbeth is reemphasized. Both Shakespeare and Kurosawa$B!G(Bs techniques interact to build the scenes of $B!H(BThrone of Blood.$B!I(B Though a personal view, I believe that Kurosawa$B!G(Bs version of the famous play is somewhat more successful in achieving Shakespeare$B!G(Bs intentions than Polanski$B!G(Bs.
0060005424|5.0|The mound near the Red Lake is an area where living things do not go.  Yet, there is a being, maybe not much of a human anymore, who is drawn to it.  His name is Hedge.  He can feel the raw evil power coming from the mound and is intending to harness the power.  This source of raw evil is one of the greatest that the kingdom has seen, and the king, queen, and Clayr are unprepared to deal with it.<BR>   <BR>Lirael lives in the Clayr, a home for seers that is shielded by a surrounding glacier.  Growing up isolated in an environment emphasizing The Sight, Lirael is dejected and ashamed.  She is already fourteen, yet she has not received The Sight, a clairvoyance which women of the Clayr attain around the time of puberty.  <br />The Clayr use The Sight to monitor the Kingdom and  report any threats to the King and the Queen.  Lately, there has been a fervor in the Clayr because they are not able to see the area around the Red Lake.  Lirael cannot help the Clayr see anything, much less the evil building up around the Red Lake.  <br />Her usefulness is not in question with one member of the Clayr, however.  Lirael is briefly introduced to her great-great grandmother, who tells Lirael that it is better to be a do-er than a see-er.  Lirael's kinswoman knows that despite Lirael's self-deprecation, she has much power.  She can use her power to save the kingdom from the growing evil at the Red Lake. <br />You will smile as you identify with Lirael's struggles with pubescence, and you will hold your breath as she squeezes through some tough situations.  The characters are unique; there are necromancers who control the dead, seers who see many possible futures, pets created by magic, dangerous libraries and other imaginative twists.  The ending might not be as conclusive as you expect, though.  Hopefully, the sequel Abhorsen will tie up some loose ends.
6302891272|3.0|I am a student at Nagoya International School and recently in my english literature class, we studied the great play of Macbeth, written by Shakespeare. After watching all the english versions of this play, our class watched the Japanese version produced by Kurosawa.  I suppose Kurosawa has picked up the basic ideas and points thoroughly and has modified the play to suit the time period of ancietn Japan. Although Japanese is a completely different language and viewers may think that the same message would not be passed on, however Kurosawa resolves this problem through various visual techniques and minimizes the language in the play. In order to boost up the dark and evil atmosphere, Kurosawa continuously applies 'effects' such as fog, haze, lightning, rain, spooky music, etc. The most significant scene in the play was how the witches were presented as a 'mononoke'(monster) spinning a wheal that indicates evil fate (same affect with witches), instead of three wicked women. As we can see Kurosawa did not leave out any details that needed modifications. The only major bit that Kurosawa left out was Macduff's existence; he never appeared in this version, thus there was only one prophecy for washizu (Macbeth) to be aware of. And finally, I'd like to point out the relationship between Washizu (Macbeth) and Asaji(L. Macbeth). In the original Shakespearean version, we see passion and love between them, but as the Japanese culture do not show much passion nor love through action, in this movie there are no physical attraction observed. However, the ambition of Asaji to achieve the 'goal' probably is the most distinctive than any other versions of &quot;Macbeth&quot;.
0679309411|5.0|Ms. Roy has written one of the most wonderful works of descriptive prose that I have ever had the good fortune to read. Her words evoke an emotional response that is pure and honest, and the sorrow that I felt as I followed along was nearly perfect in it's authenticity. She made me aware of being an outsider to the precedings of the novel, yet I felt as though I were there, in Kerala, standing just outside the characters' home, listening through an open window. Her theme of love and its consequences and availability is staggering in its sadness and truth. This is a truly beautiful book.
0060987464|5.0|I was given this book as a christmas present, so as you do i thought i'd read a page or two of it while waiting for a party to begin...7 hours later i had read the entire book and thus missed the party, that's how truly addictive it was. It's quite probaly the best book i've ever read. His life made mine boring in comparision with its uncommon events, amazing moments and often disturbing times such as his grandfather's basement...and ending with a quote from the back cover of the book &quot;The best rock autobiography...since Iggy Pop's I Need More&quot;, how true.
0061015725|1.0|Like the others who hated this book, I'll be brief.  I consider myself a fan of Crichton and I've read many of his books.  Airframe was one of the first books I literally couldn't put down until I'd finished it.  But this junker Prey is not worthy of the author and makes me question whether he even wrote it, or just signed off on a ghost writer's lame attempt to follow the Crichton formula.<br />In one word, this book is AWFUL!
B00005JMTQ|5.0|SEE THIS FILM IF YOU LIKE TRULY FUNNY ROMANTIC COMEDIES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE A MEANINGFUL STORYLINE. My wife was a little reluctant to see this movie given her lack of appreciation for the sort of roles in which Jack Nicholson often stars, but the favorable reviews, potentially appealing subject matter and my desire to see this film overcame her objections and we both enjoyed it immensely. (This was definitely his best performance since AS GOOD AS IT GETS.) Usually I have no trouble finding some meaningless moments during a movie to get the free soda and popcorn refills or take a bathroom break, but the action here was so constant that I was afraid that I would miss something meaningful to the storyline if I left the theater for a few minutes.<br />The plot is really simple. Erica Barry is a famous playwright in her midfifties who has reacted to her divorce by rededicating herself to her work and efforts at self improvement and settled into a routine that doesn't leave time to contemplate the absence of a male in her life. Marin (Amanda Peet) is her daughter (early thirties) who unbeknownst to Erica has just initiated a relationship with Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson), a very successful sixty-three year old businessman and famous bachelor/womanizer. When Harry and Erica unexpectedly meet at Erica's retreat in the Hamptons, an atmosphere of hostility between them develops almost instantly. That evening, Erica saves Harry's life following his heart attack and meets an admirer in Harry's ER physician, Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), who has seen every play that she has ever written. In the interests of symmetry, Julian is thirty-four years old, so we have the potential for two May/November affairs and all the potential situations that could arise. Just to make it more interesting, Frances McDormand does a wonderful job of providing commentary as Zoe, Erica's sister and a women's studies professor at Columbia University. But don't jump to conclusions, when Erica is forced to housesit with the convalescing Harry, they both discover that maybe their preconceptions about each other need to be revised.<br />This is a great movie because Director Nancy Meyers gets the best out of the script and the cast. The timing is near perfect. You laugh when they are crying, and shed tears when things go well for them. In fact, the longer a crying jag of Erica's lasted, the more the audience where we attended laughed hysterically. Everything is clichéd, but these are clichés because they are so true to life and so recognizable, not because they are old and tired. Love vs. lust, the passion of youth vs. the experience and tenderness of age, commitment vs. freedom, order vs. spontaneity, they are all part of this story and examined with true feeling and insight.<br />And while the outcome seems predictable, there are enough twists of the plot to keep your interest. This is the sort of humor not dependent on the shock value of profanity, and while the movie is much longer (two hours ) than usual for a romantic comedy, the time passes quickly. And while the denouement was certainly predictable, it managed to be a little bittersweet rather than having the saccharine quality of so many films of this genre.<br />Tucker Andersen
B0000508U6|5.0|wow, i love this cd. mainly because it acts as a retreat from the bustling world around us, but also because it is original, and  a great companion for a rainy day. with the lyrics in &quot;don't panic&quot; and the slow soothing tune of &quot;sparks&quot;, this album shows off the best attributes of the wonderful group, Coldplay. i hope that everyone will not only pay attention to the beautiful single, &quot;yellow&quot;, but will also submerge into the rest of the cd to hear all the emotion and feeling Coldplay has to offer.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is an excellent group and this amazing CD showcases their talents in full. After buying it for just one song,(Harder to Breathe) I am absolutely amazed with the content. Every song is powerful and bold. They have a sound like none you've heard before. It can only be described as a mix of pop, rock, indie, and jazz. This is an excellent CD for anybody who likes upbeat dance songs that they can really rock out to!
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Just to answer a question about the song in the &quot;Return of the King&quot; trailer... that song is actually taken off of the &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; soundtrack- you can find the song there, though I can't remember the name of it.
B000060P79|1.0|...\\"Punk rock\\" meant Crass, Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Black Flag, Agnostic Front, Bad Religion, etc.? Probably not, judging by this band's chosen demographic. But let me tell you, I guess those those days are gone, since the always dead-on MTV & Co. are calling this punk. In other news, Sid Vicious rolls over in his grave and Jello Biafra hangs himself out of shame. But on to this CD...<br />No, I don't own it, but I DID make the mistake of buying it the first time around, back when it was called NEW FOUND GLORY. I have, however, heard a number of these songs through compilations and unfortunate run-ins with the radio. Emotional, it is not. Meaningful, it is not. Original, it is not. And \\"punk\\" it most definitely is not. Where's the righteous indignation at the sociopolitical wrongs of this country? Where does Simple Plan advocate overthrowing the government? Where's the general hatred of authority? I guess 'punk' isn't a lifestyle or mindset after all. It's just another \\"new-wave plastic trend,\\" (-Bad Religion. Remember them? Didn't think so.) <br />The review by \\"Kelly\\" from Missouri, or \\"Jessa and Julia\\" from NYC should be enough motivation to avoid this CD, let alone show how urgently this country needs education reform (hey, Simple Plan, there's a 'punk' topic for you guys not to write about!). <br />Bottom line, if you want pop-punk, check out the Ramones, the Descendents (the most underappreciated band today), early No Use for A Name or Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. If you want emo, listen to Jawbreaker or Jets to Brazil. If you want respectable Canadian punk, check out Propagandhi. If you want pseudo-punk, pseudo-emo, unoriginal garbage, then by all means, waste 14 bucks on \\"No Helmets, No Pads, Just Balls.\\" Thank you for your time.
B00004LN16|3.0|It's been a while since I dragged out &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, but I'm glad I did. Having been an Acker-Dacker fan since very early on (thanks Dad!), I was refreshed to listen to the latest outing. Yes, it's an AC/DC album. It has some catchy tracks (Stiff Upper Lip, Satellite Blues) and it has some stinkers, but it has something different about it. It's more blues than rock'n'roll, and it's about paying homage to your roots. I remember hearing Brian talk about the album when it came out saying that it was more about getting back to the basics of rock'n'roll, which means blues. <br />Pick it up, listen to it, put it in the CD rack with your other AC/DC albums and remember why you like the band. Raw rock and roll with some blues mixed in.
B00009NH5W|5.0|Flashback 1987 Terence Trent D'arby (BTW he goes by the name Sananda Maitreya now) His C.D.'s Inroducing the Hardline...(Great funk music), Neither Fish, Nor Flesh (My 2nd favorite), Symphony or Damn (Great mixture of rock, soul and yes country), Vibrator (Great Rock/Soul C.D.) and now 8 years later...Wild Card- The Jokers Edition. Wow! No wonder it took him so long to release a C.D. This is pure perfection and his best work yet. A mixture of diverse music. So candid! 19 songs of pure soul music at it's Greatest! Outshines anything that is out there now. Truly a piece or ART! I've seen him perform live 4 times now, By the way i recently saw him at B.B. Kings (NYC) this summer 2003 and his voice is still incredible! Don't miss out on this C.D. release you won't be sorry! Check out his Official Website...

0385504209|5.0|I'm an avid reader who has never been a fan of best selling novels. Just because a novel is loved by the masses does not mean that it will be a story I will like, so for the longest time, I ignored this one. It wasn't until I saw the ABC special on Mary Magdelene that featured interviews with Dan Brown and information on the book that it grabbed my interest. I bought the book the next day and read it within a few days, not wanting to put it down and not wanting the story to be over.  I found his fast paced writing style perfect for this type of thriller.  It kept me in suspense for just long enough and then shocked me with each new revelation.  I loved his use of art and architecture that exists in our real world and the way he incorporated it into his story with the symbology to make the story so believable. It all fit together like a perfect puzzle.  I have no idea if the secrets the characters in the book find are real or if it even matters if it's true.  It's a fictional piece of literature that captured my imagination and left me amazed, wondering about all the things in the world that we may never know the truth about.  It was the type of book that I kept thinking about even days and weeks and months after I finished reading it.  It made me want to look into and research the different topics brought up throughout the book, including not only the different theories on what the Holy Grail truly is, but also all the different art, architecture, and symbolgy found in the book.  It's a book I would highly recommend but I can also see how many people would be offended by the book.  It presents theories that totally contradict what so many of the world's people were taught to believe.  Nonetheless, I think it is a great book and one of my all time favorite reads ever.
B000056HOZ|3.0|Disk 1 is very good with live performances. Disk 2 was not that great and is videos. I wanted the song Rosalita as that is the best song and is missing from latest DVD's.
B00000IN5G|5.0|This album is defenately underrated. It should be on the same, or higher level with metallicas \\"Master of Puppets\\", eventhough in my opinion Children of Bodom are much better.<BR>The sound on this album is not as polished up as \\"Follow the Reaper\\" and \\"Hetacrew Deathroll\\", but still amazing.<BR>Melodic, but extremely brutal. In some places, the brutallity of the album is simular to Carcass. I could be wrong, but there defenately some Grind Metal influences in the songs Black Widow, Bed of Razors, Wrath Withing, and the third one, forgot its name
0891349553|5.0|I am a beginner of Polymer clay and this book does not intimidate me. The techniques she offers and the tools are simple and easy to understand.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00008J4P5|5.0|1. Seven Nation Army- I've heard it a million times, but I'm still not sick of it. A great song that will make you tap your feet/hum along/rave, depending on your disposition and location at the time.<BR>2. Black Math- Really fun rebellious sounding rocker.<BR>3. There's No Home For You Here- At first I didn't like it much, but now I think it's cool. A little over the top, but really haunting in a way.<BR>4. I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself- A cool cover song. I love how it it starts out quiet, then builds up, goes back down, and then goes out with a BANG, haha.<BR>5. In The Cold, Cold Night- Meg steps up to the mic! A cool, sultry little song, very easy to play on guitar if you like that sort of thing.<BR>6. I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart- McCartney-esque piano and vocals tell the tale of  young love facing maternal disapproval (in an amusing and sad way).<BR>7. You've Got Her In Your Pocket- A pretty melody and sweet lyrics, with some technically flawed but gorgeously heartfelt singing from Jack.<BR>8. Ball and Biscuit- Hooray for some blues! Fabulous guitar solos and hilarious pick-up line lyrics.<BR>9. The Hardest Button to Button- Catchy like SNA, a really cool song.<BR>10. Little Acorns- A funny spoken intro, a good but not great song. My least favorite on the album.<BR>11. Hypnotize- Reminds me of sixties James Bond movie with go-go dancers.<BR>12. The Air Near My Fingers- Hard to describe, but cool.<BR>13. Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine- Yelping lyrics, frantic guitar, a funny theme.<BR>14. It's True That We Love One Another- A funny country-folk sounding song with Holly Golightly singing (and Meg too!). Fun to sing along with, amusing lyrics. Not musically excellent, just funny and catchy and sarcastic.<br />Overall- fabulous. Weird, but fabulous.
B00005JMCW|4.0|Remakes, like song covers, are iffy prospects because they rarely come close to approaching to the majesty of the original.  Disney succeeds with it's &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; remake because it doesn't fight the story, but merely updates it with contemporary actors and themes.  Lindsay Lohan is the best actress to come out of Disney in years, and is always a joy to watch for her unflinching honesty and willingness to take the viewers on an emotional journey.  Jamie Lee Curtis is the &quot;Cher&quot; of motion pictures; people always forget how wonderful she is until she comes barreling back with another fantastic performance.  Both actresses have incredible comic flair and a true sense of physical comedy, as well as a chemistry that completely renders their mother-daughter relationship plausible.<br />In terms of story, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; manages to incorporate contemporary themes like parental death, working parents, remarriage, blended families, teenage angst over love and school, and the like, without seeming preachy or offering any trite solutions.  Both mother and daughter learn the only way to heal their fractured relationship is to talk honestly with one another.  None of the plot lines or messages are rushed or underdeveloped, but presented simply without melodrama.  Thus the movie is accessible to children of all ages, respectful of teenagers and the problems they encounter, and is a nice diversion for adults and parents who are afraid to suffer through another &quot;kiddie&quot; movie.<br />This movie was very well done, with good acting and sequence, a better-than-average plot, and a catchy soundtrack.  Enjoyable for all ages and highly recommended for not catering to the expected.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth stays with its Death Metal roots with jarring riffs and dark lyrics.  However, they also bring pure musicianship to the mix, and aren't afraid to go out on a limb with melodic movements within their songs.<br />They have their own sound, and it is a great one.  I highly recommend this especially to metal heads that couldn't listen to the death metal sub-genre before.  This may be the crossover for you.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|Anyone who watches  any of the Evil Dead series should know going in that they are low budget films, but enter with an open <BR>mind and you will not go away dissapointed. Sure the sets and actors are not from the Hollywood mold, but that in essence is what makes this film and others of it's genre trully artful. By<BR>making the most with what they had to work with, Sam Raimi and<BR>cast make a real attempt to freighten while never taking themselves or their craft too seriously.Evil Dead and it's <br />brethen are great for what they are: tongue in cheek horror<BR>at it't very best, anybody who watches this movie and doesn't laugh at least a little, just don't get it. Not every director<BR>gets $100 milion to make Waterworld, but for those who get it, these movies rock!!!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I absolutely love Howard Shore's music. I've never listened to any other soundtrack more than I have for Lord of the Rings. The Return of the King soundtrack did for me what it did for The Two Towers soundtrack; it made me appreciate this kind of music more.  And yes, I was particularly excited that Billy Boyd had a solo and must I say it lived up to my expectations and more. His voice is so \\"purdy\\". And Viggo's little song at the end of \\"The Return of the King\\" was awesome as well. I bought this CD opening day and when I first listened to track 18, I was thinking \\"Oh, this really is a pretty piece of music\\" and I look at the title of the song: \\"The Grey Havens\\". Right when I saw the title, the first thing that came to my mind was \\"Oh, I'm gonna cry when I see this movie!\\" and I did..<br />So, if you really like Lord of the Rings or just wanna listen to great music, this CD is definitely recommeneded. Some of the songs that stand out (for me) are Hope and Memory, Minas Tirith, The Steward of Gondor, Twilight and Sahdow, Anduril, The Black Gate Opens, The End of all Things (Mount Doom, y'all!!), The Return of the King, The Grey Havens, and Into the West.
B00006G8G1|5.0|My wife had only heard of &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; before this DVD.  Not only did I get her to watch this DVD, but we went to the last tour in our area and now she is convinced.  Several people didn't like this DVD, but I think it is great.  I'm about to buy my second copy.  The first is almost worn out.  I hope Maiden keeps it coming.
B000005YZM|5.0|Well, I'll give it up: Amazon's good.  This was just posted to me as a recommendation, and not only do I already own it, but it's one of my very favorite records.<br />Buy this.  Seriously.  I can't say anything else.  I give no caveats, I offer you nothing else.  &quot;A Rose for Emily,&quot; &quot;Beachwood Park,&quot; &quot;Time of the Season,&quot; and &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot; are among the greatest pop tunes of all time.  REALLY, BUY THIS!  I can't sing it strong enough.  If you don't own this album, please correct that.  <br />Really!
0805066691|3.0|I've only read the first 90 or so pages of this book, but I think I can say that it is pretty bad and not likely to get much better. I mean, it certainly was an important work in that it provided the other side to the story on the Indian wars, but as other viewers have pointed out, it is biased. It does seem more like a cheesy hollywood historical drama, where everything is painted in black and white. We get lots of superficial details and not much meat. I'd like to know what it felt like to be a Native American or a settler back then, and this book didn't give me that. It gave me High School History, the kind of history that turns people off to history. However, the book does have good qualities as well. It lets Native Americans speak for themselves about their history, when traditionally europeans have been the only ones speaking; some of the beautiful language of Native Americans can be heard, the nature metaphors. There is some decent irony. There's some nice description-- And the book seems pretty comprehensive in covering the history of the time. But I cannot continue reading it...it's quite drab. There must be better written histories of this time, that capture the complexity of the relationship between Native Americans and Europeans.
B00004XONN|5.0|Don't you all realize that Radiohead keep getting better and better?  Okay, &quot;Bends&quot; was a great record, but honestly, their last three records trump it!  I mean it!  I don't know how to get this through to all of you Coldplay fans, but hell, even Chris Martin admits that Radiohead are head and shoulders above anybody else right now.  <br />I truly love this record!  My prescription for the haters: listen to Neu!'s first record and Can's &quot;Future Days,&quot; come back to &quot;Kid A,&quot; and it will all make sense, and you'll never be able to live without this record again.<br />Believe it!

B000002H2H|5.0|i just got this cd and it rocks! it is the first metallica cd that i have owned and it is really good.  i have heard that metallica isnt as good anymore but based on this cd they used to be good a while ago.  one of the best songs on the cd is 'trapped under the ice'.  it may have only 8 songs but its a good thing that theyre long because i naver get tired of it! buy this now!    ROCK ON!!!
6305364613|1.0|the whole film is absolutely ruined by the actors who can't act at all. It's a nice try of Luhrmann to combine the postmodern scenario with the Elizabethan language, and uses the images to replace the poetic sense, but the actors, almost none of them trained for a Shakespearean text, ruin the whole feeling of poetry within a world of violence thing. Esp Leonardo Dicaprio--he's like THE worst actor I have ever seen. I thought he looked stupid enough in Titanic,but his acting skill is just beyond imagination...
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the most accurate and on-the-money movie based on Pearl Harbor.  It's much better than the overrated botch job that was &quot;Saving Private Ryan,&quot; and it has awesome performances by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett that will haunt you for years.  I'm shocked neither got an Oscar nomination.  Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer are geniuses who know how to make an intelligent film without insulting the audience.  If Speilberg is smart, he should buy this DVD to watch and study so he knows how to make an awesome war film.  Aside from &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; the only other film that's better than &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is &quot;Titanic.&quot;
B000003TA4|2.0|the most overrated album of all time.  Cobain spoke to many, but not me.  I'd heard all before, and done by better, with real heart and a sense of humor, in the form of Paul Westerberg.  Let's face it, Nirvana was the lucky band at the right time.  College radio and alternative music was bubbling under the surface throughout the '80's.  Yeah, the grunge movement helped to kick the 80's pop-metal trash off MTV.  But, after the succeess of the Seattle scene, we were subject to the horrors of the likes of Bush and Creed.  UGHHHH!!!  Cobain was right to have his insecurities about his success.  Many before him set the table, and he was greeted as king.  Imagine the horror to Killing Joke fans when the killer riff of \\"Eighties\\" ends up being blatantly ripped off for \\"Come As You Are\\".  (Heck, he basically ripped off the Beatles \\"Things We Said Today\\" for \\"About A Girl\\", so such overt plagiarism should come as no surprise.)  And, the contempt Cobain showed for his audience on \\"In Bloom\\" was rather disgusting.  If anything, \\"Nevermind\\" was nail in the coffin of alternative/college radio.  Even REM made a medicore album, \\"Monster\\", in response to \\"Nevermind\\".  I'd just assume go listen to any of Grohl's work in the Foo Fighters before putting this CD in my discman.
0345440900|5.0|I loved this book!  I was very surprised at some of the reviews saying that it recommends a bad parenting style.  The routine that Tracy suggests is EASY (Eat, Activity, Sleep, and You).  Our son seemed to naturally fall into this type of pattern anyway so it felt right to me.  Tracy helped us to better understand his cries and the various ways that he was communicating with us.  It all worked like a charm.  He sleeps and naps really well and with little fussing if I put him down before he is overtired.  He has been sleeping for 12 hours uninterrupted at night since week 8.  Some of the reviews thought the book's suggestions were rigid and cruel.  I didn't get any of that from this book; if anything I thought everything suggested was very flexible and loving.  Tracy never once suggests that you ignore a crying infant.  Instead she recommends that you respond to your baby's needs in such a way that it teaches your child to fall asleep on his own.  Suggestions like putting him in his crib for a nap once he exhibits signs of sleepiness (rubbing eyes, yawns, turning away from a face or a toy).  If I do this with our son he falls asleep easily without any crying.  I never once got the impression that Tracy was suggesting that we not hold or cuddle our infants as some reviewers seem to suggest.  Her method really worked for us and we have a very happy infant who receives a lot of attention and love from us.  There are various methods out there suggested by many.  This one worked well for us.  Maybe it won't for others.  Bottomline was that I found it to be a nice go between for the &quot;let them cry it out&quot; group and the &quot;co-sleeping&quot; group.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Despite the recent controversy surrounding his personal life, Michael Jackson has long been known as the King Of Pop, and with good reason.  For most pop stars, their time in the spotlight lasts maybe 2-3 years before they are reduced to guest appearances on weekly sit-coms or the occassional &quot;info-mercial&quot;.  This is not true of Jackson, whos reign at the top has carried him through the past 2+ decades since the onset of his solo career after leaving the Jackson Five.  <br />This collection of Number One hits is therefore a must have for any fan of the pop genre.  Since the 1980's, Jacksons eclectic, diverse style has seen many landmarks in the music industry, setting new standards, breaking new ground and re-inventing a style that was in its infancy when Jackson came into his own.  His pioneering sound created a whole new generation of music and for that he was rewarded the title &quot;King of Pop&quot;.<br />The album features 18 of Jackson most beloved songs, featured in the order which they originally made it to number one.  Included on the album are some of his largest breakout hits like &quot;Billy Jean&quot; and Beat It&quot; which both became such huge hits that they are immediately recognizable by audiences today.  <br />The song &quot;Thriller&quot;, which also emerged early in Jackson's solo career, firmly planted the superstars reputation as a serious talent in the industry.  Not only was Jackson re-inventing the style of music, he was setting a new standard unprecedented in the industry at that time.  Music television was only a few years old when the video for &quot;Thriller&quot;, a 10+ minute short film, was released for the first time.  The video, which was so well produced that it rose immediately to the head of the video industry, set a new level of quality in the genre that artists have been struggling to match since.<br />The album also features a number of other large hits for Michael, including the songs which added to the early controversy in Jackson's professional career.  &quot;Black or White&quot;, a song about racial equality again put Jackson in the spotlight for his controversal portrayal of violence against authority.  &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; also feature Jackson's hard driving rythems and smooth, sometimes aggressive lyrics covering a range of topics that has often lead to speculation and ridicule by the press, while at the same time leaving his world-wide hordes of fans clammoring for more.<br />Some of the more poignant pieces in this collection include songs like &quot;Man In the Mirror&quot;, a song where Michael points the finger at himself while pondering the choices in his life.  <br />In all, the album is a great collection of all his number one hits, and is a great look back at the man who created a genre that has grown since he stepped to the front of the class, but never outgrown his talent.  With the onset of this generations pop superstars like Justin Timberlake, Brittany Spears and Chrsitina Aguilera, it is a further testimony to his talent and sheer ability that Michael Jackson has remained such a huge part of not only the genre, but the music industry as a whole.  Love him or hate him, his talent is unmistakable and unquestionable.<br />This compilation of hits is a great addition to any music collection, and is a must have for any Jackson fan.  For anyone who isn't already familiar with his music, this collection is a great introduction into the mind and soul of a man who reshaped the music industry.  Jackson truly is the King of Pop, and through this album, you can enter the gates to his kingdom.  Give this album a listen, you won't be disappointed.<br />Scott Kolecki

B000002H97|5.0|Metallica's 1991 album known as &quot;Black Album&quot; is one of the most sold metal albums in rock history and the reign continued until about 1994 and eventually changed the course of rock history and paved the way to aggressive core-metal bands or grunge/alternative followers. Even melodic rock bugs like me who like 80s stadium rock such as Survivor, Journey, TOTO, and Foreigner this album can be enjoyable. I listen to this album when I want to listen something heavy and not feeling enough with Bad English/Damn Yankees/Hardline styled melodoc hard rock gems. ENTER SANDMAN is a dark-toned but orthodox metal track that makes me an addict of Metallica music. SAD BUT TRUE is also similarly styled (something like Creed stuff) dark-metal beauty. By the time you listen to HOLIER THAN THOU, you are stuck on their material. THE UNFORGIVEN is an acoustic ballad that became super-hit boosting album sales and this reminds me a bit of Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven at the opening intro. If you like the first four songs, you will be staight ahead until the end of this album.<br />This album can serve as an introduction to metal world. The magic of widespread appeal might have come from the producer Bob Rock, master of hard rock music. Recommended for wide range of rock fans.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Every Friday I was stoked about watching Firefly and John Doe on FOX...but FOX has some problem with always screwing with their friday programming and they really screwed themselves for primetime by cancelling this show. It was great. As avid Sci Fi lover this show has more balls than Star Trek does because there is no Prime Directive...and even if there was...to hell with the Prime Directive when you're trying to survive. Babylon 5 has nothing on this... The characters are a great mix and I really enjoyed watching the lonewolf types starting to grow together and relying on each other... and there were the tense moments when their loyalty and trust was tested to it's limits. I'm buying this and you should too.   -Jay Sin
0688170528|4.0|The Pact by Jodi Picoult is a very hard book to put down.  It hooks you from the first pharagragh.  The way Jodi Picoult tells the story keeps you hooked from begning to end.  I enjoy how she goes back and forth between past and present.  I found myself in all my classes at school reaching into my book bag, taking the book out and reading.  It is kind of depressing, but i still highky recommend it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|When I first read the revised song list for the &quot;new&quot; version of Let It Be Naked I wasn't that impressed.  So they took out Dig it and Maggie Mae and put in Don't let me down. Big deal! What's the point? However after the first listen to LIBN (and many , many more since) I can only say... WOW! I LOVE IT!<br />Any criticisms of this album's production e.g. the dropping of dialogue and any Lennon , instrumental&quot;flubs&quot; or the so-called &quot;flying in&quot; of edits to improve the performances are probably from the sentimental purist fans, who I believe fail to recognise the following:<BR>- the Spectorised version of LIB never actually sounded like a true Beatles album. Rather it was more like an over-produced, incohesive bunch of tracks, the running order of which never  sounded right and in some respects was very sloppy in it's overall effect. It was more like an apology for a Beatles album from a group who were self-destructing (seemingly) and the original LIB made it sound very much that way!<br />But this was from the same Beatles who went on to produce the very together Abbey Road not long after! Now thanks to all concerned in the production of LIBN a distortion in Beatles history has been corrected. This &quot;new&quot; version finally sounds like a proper Beatles album with well-produced songs in a cohesive order.<br />So to the songs:<BR>Get Back - (The original title for the whole project) is a tight rocker from McCartney. Sure there is no quip at the end , but which ending should have been used (there are at least two) ? The tightness of this version sets the tone for the whole album being a &quot;back to basics, no frills&quot; production, although not an unplugged album as some might believe.<br />Dig a Pony - A nice Lennon track with lots of typical Lennonism's.<br />For you Blue - Follows on the basic theme and is a simple little Harrison rocker.<br />The Long and Winding Road - Finally we hear it in it's true simplistic form, a beautiful McCartney song (no wonder the Spector version annoyed Paul).<br />Two of Us -  A great little song from John and Paul with a definite Everly's flavour.<br />I've got a Feeling - A clever bit of interweaving of two songs by John and Paul. I like the reference &quot;If you leave me I'd hate to miss the train&quot; which sets the scene for the next track (which is about a train).<br />The One after 909 - I never liked the sloppy LIB version of this, whereas this version is more balanced, tighter in production and sounds much more like the original 1963 take of the truly great little Lennon - McCartney rocker they wrote back in 1957. Far from being a &quot;filler&quot; track this is a great back to basics track that proves the Beatles could always rock with the best!<br />Don't let me down -  I absolutely agree that this track always  belonged on  LIB and sounds like it always was. Why would anyone want the Lennon vocal  flubs included (e.g. as on the live take) if you were going to produce a high quality album. Surely you would be consistent in fixing in fixing all these (unless you were Phil, I guess).<br />I Me Mine - A great Harrison track and quite fitting that as it was the last recorded Beatles song it should be included.<br />Across the Universe - John would have loved this production which is haunting in it's simplicity with an eerie fade-out. It kind of says farewell to John in that it's his last track on the album and a great lead into the final song.<br />Let it be - Well, Paul finally put things right, including this version which says it all about the album and the group. I like the new guitar solo which fits the more basic feel of the song. A fitting end to a great Beatles album which sounds like it fits now between the White Album  and Abbey Road while still managing to be a perfect last release.<br />All in all, a well balanced album with songs that are basic in feel and presentation, with rockers and ballads, old and new songs, solos and duets anda good cross section from John, Paul and George. In the end the Beatles finally managed to GET BACK and maybe now we can finally LET IT BE and enjoy the result. Well done Paul, John, George and Ringo! <br />Review by Warren Voight in Dunedin, New Zealand.
B000050XY8|2.0|This is not a review of the movie - the Matrix is by itself an interesting subject - but instead this is review of what's available in the package you get.<br />I had The Matrix on DVD from back when it first came out. Somehow, when the son moved to College, I lost my Matrix DVD, so I finally decided to replenish my collection and get, what I thought was a 2 disc version with more behind the scenes stuff.<br />Instead, I get a single disk, with the excat same content as my old (collection happy - buyer is not), a poster, some pictures and a frame of the movie blown up. Is that worth the additional $50 (at least)??  I don't think so. But the quality of the DVD is great - as the old one. However, the box, pictures and posters will soon be archived under T for Trash.
B000002TQV|5.0|I bought this on the reviews of others and am really glad I did. Whenever I buy a cd I am always somewhat disappointed with it and need time to get into the sound, but not with this one. I was hooked 2 minutes into it, then played the whole thing three times. This is one cool cd.
0060920432|5.0|With the concept of happiness being a distraction from Flow Csikszentimihalyi sets up a myriad of powerful arguments all revealing his more philosophical side towards the end.<br />80% of adults say they would work if they had enough money not to.  The problem that exists is these same people can't wait to get home from their jobs.. even though they said they would work if money weren't an issue..?  It's not supposed to make sense because it doesn't, these people are working for far off rewards and not enjoying their task at hand.<br />By age 12 the American child associates only negative things with anything labeled as work.  The view of work needs to be changed.  This book does just that.<br />Working only for distant rewards will lead to regret and eventual disappointment.  It is by learning how to enjoy any task can one get the most enjoyment out of life.<br />Concepts are introduced that are really cool, and I'm not just talking about the &quot;oh that's cool&quot; cool I'm talking about the &quot;holy sh*t, are you serious?&quot; cool.  A lot of wisdom in the book, give it a shot.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya brings us once again the haunting music that is her trademark, written in multiple languages.<br />The CD kicks off with the mellow instrumental \\"A Day without Rain.\\"  A piano provides the principal musical instrument with Enya humming in harmony.  The music evokes nature at peace; woods with a light breeze on a cool day, light clouds dotting a peaceful sky.  You could readily sleep to this music.  The instrumental leads into \\"Wild Child,\\" a faster paced song that stays within the musical theme of the peaceful outdoors, but now the music has the theme of the wild, yet innocent child, frolicking in the benign environment.  Enya's vocals are as much instrument as the instruments themselves.  This song is beautiful in its conception and execution.<br />\\"Only Time\\" follows.  Enya proves once again that she has the ability to create beautiful musical poetry.  The deceptively light lyrics can pull the listener into a deep contemplation of love and life and the roads that we choose, and that we must have patience because only time will allow all to be revealed in fullness.<br />Enya then switches themes and styles as she moves into a Latin song with heavy bass backing.  The literal translation of \\"Tempus Vernum\\" is \\"Spring Time.\\"  The lyrics appear to be a series of words that might be considered to be opposites, such as east and west, earth and star, and autumn and spring.  Thus in one sense Roma Ryan's lyrics appear to be exploring the Yin and Yang of some Asian philosophies, the contrast of opposites.  The serious ponderous tone of the music is heavily contemplative, deep philosophical evaluation of a subject; beautiful in the selection of words and the musical match.<br />The musical tone changes again to a Gaelic lament, \\"Deora ar mo chroi,\\" or \\"Tears on My Heart.\\"  The gentle, sad music belies the actual translation of the Gaelic, which is full of beauty and happiness.  The effect is more in the poetry of the Gaelic and how well the music is matched to it rather than the actual meaning of the words.  The execution is very artistic and poignant.<br />Enya then lightens the music with \\"Flora's Secret,\\" which has a faster pace than the previous two selections.  This love song is musical poetry is beautiful and full, a musical wine.  You may either interpret the song from an aspect of nature, or of two lovers.  In either case, this song is an experience.<br />\\"Fallen Embers\\" is a dream, a memory of a former love.  Mellow, slow, but sufficiently ethereal to keep from being ponderous.  Enya's beautiful voice is the centerpiece of the song.  The instruments add fullness, but her voice alone could have carried this song.<br />\\"Silver Embers\\" is another instrumental with a moderate pace.  Short and, as always, beautiful, leading into \\"Pilgrim,\\" which is another lament.  I personally enjoy this song because the theme is that there are many roads to choose in life, some of which lead to nowhere, and yet we have no clue as to which is which, and which is the best.  We are all pilgrims in life, and this song is our song.<br />Sometimes I have difficulty in interpreting Roma Ryan's lyrics.  Such is the case with \\"One by One.\\"  I understand that this song is about love, but some of the lyrics imply there is a constraint between him and her, and she is longing to be free of those constraints.  Yet the final stanza implies that love binds them and will never die.  A bit confusing for my poor brain.<br />The quicker-paced \\"Lazy Days\\" finished off the CD.  Given the general theme of nature and love this song appears to tidily wrap up the CD with the promise of things yet to come.<br />Enya has once again created another sumptuously beautiful work of music that you can listen to time after time just to begin to appreciate the complexity and poetry of this music.  This music is unique and nearly stands in its own category.  It is artistically and technically flawless.  However, I find one flaw with this CD.  It is way too short.  The CD is just a bit over 34 minutes long.  I could argue that for the beauty and quality of the music at 34 minutes is a great length, but it seems to me that a bit more quantity would have made this CD absolutely phenomenal.  As it is, it begs to be combined with another short work to create a full CD's worth of music; admittedly a minor flaw, but one that needs to be pointed out.<br />The perfect music and vocals make this CD a must have for anyone who loves beautiful music, and certainly for Enya fans.st a bit over 34 minutes long.

B00000DFSK|4.0|First, you must understand that U2 really isn't a greatest hits band since they have many albums that are great from start to stop (Boy, War, Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby), so making a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection becomes more difficult because you'll have people who want their favorite song on the album but it won't be there.  But anyway, this is a pretty good intro to their 80's material (I should know, I bought this before I owned any of their 80's stuff).  Most of the songs on here you really can't leave off (Tracks 1-9, and 11).  My only complaint with this album is that they edited &quot;New Year's Day&quot; and &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot; (the opening minute is essential to the song).  But that's only a a minor complaint.  The new track &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; is a pretty good track and version that was the B-side of &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name&quot; is definitely worth a listen (you can find it on the B-sides disc, which I don't own, but I borrowed).  I do think that &quot;Angel Of Harlem&quot; and &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; could have been left off.  But then there is the question of what could have been in their places.  Most reviewers complain that there were no songs from &quot;October&quot; but they're wrong because if you let &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; run after it has ended, you'll find &quot;October&quot;.  I think &quot;Gloria&quot; or &quot;Fire&quot; could have been put on here, along with &quot;Bullet The Blue Sky&quot;, but the collection is good as is.  If you want proof of how good of an intro it was, after owning this for a few months, I purchased all of U2's albums from Boy to Rattle And Hum in the following months.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd is outstanding and different. It came out in 2001 and is still such a great cd. It's listening value is a 10/10. the songs never get old either. It was number 10 on MTV's top 22 cd's ever. All of the songs are great, and it's like nothing youve ever heard. Linkin Park designs a new genre in music. Here is the break down of each song on the cd.<br />Papercut 8.5/10 - Great song to open thier cd, has chester sing/yell and mike rap, this song gets better and better each time listening to it.<br />One step closer 9.5/10- HARDCORE. Linkin parks first single great song to take agression out on.<br />With You 8/10 - a good song, good vibe but maybe not my pick for number 3 spot. Good though.<br />Points of authority 9/10 - Great song, defintely an underated one, good variety in one song.<br />Crawling 10/10- Possably Linkin Parks all time most popular song, this opened up the eyes for many different fans who thought linkin park was just a &quot;One step Closer&quot; band and could only go crazy, this song is more suttle in parts but still has the rock but introduces chesters great singing voice also. excellent.<br />Runaway 8.5/10 - Another good song. Good to listen to when angry.<br />By myself 8.5/10- probably one of the most never talked about and overlooked song on the album, great song though.<br />In the end 10/10- Least Rock Most pop like but still LP pulled it off and the song was an instant hit and after 2 years is still heard on the radio<br />Place for my head 10/10- Awesome awesome song, i know bands arent going to have like 6 singles but this one definetly wouldve done fine, great song, better live.<br />Forgotten 10/10- In my opinion this song is tied with Crawling for best song on the album and it's hella underated, this song has great lyrics that most can relate too.<br />Cure for the itch 4.5/5- Im grading this one outta 5 because it has no vocals but i guess for just an instrument song its pretty good, though this is my least favorite song on thecd.<br />Pushing me away 10/10- Another underrated great song, great lyrics.<br />in conclusion Lp scored a 106.5/115 %92.6 (EXCELLENT)<br />Defintitley a buy you will treasure it forever. Best Cd.
B00009P1O2|5.0|One of the things about this DVD that is not mentioned in other critiques, is the exerps of the friday concert (warm-up concert if you like). This is where you see Queen as you REALY would have back then. The boys are relaxed and having fun, because to the best of their knowledge, this footing will never be shown.In their minds, the camera crews are &quot;practicing&quot; for the BIG show the next evening. That to me, is the real &quot;jewel&quot; on this DVD.  The &quot;official&quot; concert is great but when you know you are being recorded for the ages you just can't act the same...It's human nature. Queen as they realy were the 5 times I saw them live... A MUST for anyone who thinks they might enjoy Queen.
B000001GRZ|5.0|Pierre Fournir's reccording of the Bach cello suites is rich in tone, expression and musicality. I really like his phrasing; it i s really clear, yet elegant and appropriate.<BR>Fournir's interpratation displays an excellent understanding of each and every phrase and also a great understanding of the Baroque style. His tone is also very rich and attractive and it makes the reccording even more of a pleasure to listen to.<BR>Although all the suites were for for the most part played supurbly, I'd have to say that my favorites are suites 3 and 4, I  cannot imagine a more perfect interpratation of those suites.<BR>The only negetive comment I have is concerning the Saraband of the 6th suite. Overall, that saraband needs to be played more delicately. I found the overall character to be too loud and &quot;in your face&quot;. <BR>However, Fournir does an excellent job on all the other sarabands and all the other movements on this CD.<BR>I would not only reccomend this reccording to cellists, but to all musicians who want to improve their phrasing. The phrasing on this reccording is absoulutly supurb. Personaly,I have learned so much about phrasing from this reccording. <BR> This reccording would be an asset to any musician's or music lover's CD collection
B000067JBN|4.0|This film is a very much enriched adaptation of the book by H.G. Wells. First it contains a romantic beginning and a voyage in the past to correct the death of the girlfriend of the hero. Unluckily you cannot change the past, you can only change the circumstances of events. But the main bulk of the film is of course going to the distant future, to see what the earth and humanity will be. It projects the tale in the book into thefinal episode of the book : the disappearance of the hero with his time machine. The film also changes the philosophical meaning of the book. In the book, humanity in the future is divided in two species, one living underground and working, the descendents of the working class, and one living on the surface on the luxuriant nature without having to work, the descendents of the bourgeoisie. In other words H.G. Wells invests darwinism into the schematic vision of the first industrial revolution and its class struggle. Unluckily in the future the working species hunts the non-working species who are their meat. In the film the same evolution is caused by a natural catastrophe : the disintegration of the moon and its falling onto the earth. We can note that the surface species has regressed to a primitive state and the underground species has become some kind of devilish industrial species that works to produce nothing, the slaves of their own underground pointless industry, some modern representation of the devil or hell. One point is common : this world has lost all connection with god, all religious dimension, and this future world is the result of some darwinistic evolution. It is the future of humanity after the death of God, though less clearly in the film than in the book. The rest you have to see by yourself. The special effects are quite good and they really look natural. The suspense of the film is also very strong. But I will regret two things : some of the technical points are a lot fuzzier than in the book, hence we have to accept a lot more unrealistic questionable points and I do not think H.G. Wells envisaged the idea of teaching the surface species how to fight : they were absolutely non-working and for them fighting was not even a concept they could imagine, invent or learn. In fact, and here the film is short, to fight you need to believe in some higher and stronger force that gives you the objective and energy to fight. This is often some religious representation of the group that justifies, hence sustains fighting against other groups. But this shortcoming reveals a shortcoming in the book : any living species will have a survival instinct and hence fighting will be natural, not something you learn like in the film, not something you ignore like in the book, something you know because of your hormones.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUlot more unrealistic questionable points and I do not think H.G.

B000006TRV|5.0|This is an essential work of Pink Floyd and is not only commercially their best, but in my opinion, IS their best. Pink Floyd is a rather calm rock group, basically set in their ways throughout the 70's. They loved to experiment with sounds in the early 70's which intentionally became as groundbreaking as Brian Eno's / David Bowie's work later that decade. <br />Pink Floyd is far from your typical rock band and 1979's release \\"The Wall\\" is far from your typical art-rock-fluid album. I often enjoy reviewing albums, but this one I struggle with reviewing for a few reasons :<br />1. There's the idea of \\"the emotional walls we build around ourselves.\\"<BR>2. In the 1983 film based on this album (if you haven't see it I'd actually recommend viewing it prior to your purchase of the album), was actually a reference to the Warsaw Ghetto during Nazi Germany.<BR>3. It may have been a tribute directly to former Pink Floyd member Syd Barrett who's isolation had troubled and haunted the rest of the band for years beyond the 60's and 70's.<br />If lead singer / songwriter Roger Waters was already thinking ahead of his time while contributing his abstract songwriting skills, he might have meant \\"The Wall\\" to be a dual reference both to WW2's Germany and personal and Barrett's psychological isolation. <br />Fortunately, \\"The Wall's\\" myriad of songs all remain very pointed and achieve their goal in broadcasting the album's ideas across.<BR>Although the Wall was mostly a Pink Floyd effort it had producer Bob Ezrin's concept feel and he definately get's the feel for it down more so through the orchestration of the atmosphere. However it's nice to see mr. ezrin did not veer the group far from their signature psychedelic-injected  darkness which grew apparent on 1977's \\"Animals\\". Roger Waters and  David Gilmour were good at complementing each other with the vocals on certain tracks. It's also true that The Wall has some of PF's best late 70's material. Many classics arose fast and radiofriendly. <br />Ultimately, \\"The Wall\\" clearly offers us a range of emotions and occasionally subtle tones. Examples are : <br />The fearfully paranoid and fast-paced drama of \\"Run Like Hell\\".<BR>The sedative-laced and ironically uncomfotable \\"Comfortably Numb\\".<BR>The despair and abandonment of \\"Hey You.\\"<BR>The classic student rebellion of \\"Another Brick in the Wall part 2.\\" <BR>The neurotic questioning of \\"Mother.\\"<BR>The sex-induced fantasy of \\"Young Lust.\\" <br />These are just some of the small puzzle pieces which make up this exciting, though (in my opinion) kind of unnecessarily long album. <br />I'd recommend this album to start out with for anyone who is interested, but hasn't heard much from the group. Even if it is a hard to understand this album, it offers us some true Floyd classics from the 70's. <br />The Wall should be sought out prior to 1973's \\"Dark Side of the Moon's\\" which was great too (and inferior to the Wall I think), but vastly overrated and overplayed.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is, in my opinion, one of the best albums ever produced. All of the songs are incredible, Chris Martin's voice is wonderful, and the band plays some incredible guitar and drum beats.<br />My favorite song on the album is one that gets little attention: Green Eyes. It is staggeringly beautiful, simple, and sweet. Though all songs are just plain great, standouts for me include &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, and &quot;Warning Sign&quot;.<br />&quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is one of those albums that is good the first time you hear it, but gets better and better every time you listen again. I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who have heard and liked anything else by Coldplay.
B000002H70|5.0|I highly recommend this CD to any and everyone. Easily one of the best CDs to ever come out. Robert Smith paints a gloomy picture of sadness with his trademark vocals. Unlike Pornography though, this kind of depression is not self destructive. Each of the band members seems to have gotten to an all time creative high when writing Disintegration. This is a beautiful CD to add to your collection. Its predominantly melonchally sound is sure to calm anyone patient enough to listen. <br />NOTE: Track 10, entitled Disintegration, is one of my all time favorite songs. Its about 8 minutes long, but easily overshadows the rest of the CD with its self-expression. It's a MUST have.
B00005JKHN|4.0|I, like most, have always felt watching Princess Aurora and her prince is about as exciting as watching two sloths climbing a tree. That said, the pluses of the film far outweigh those two major minuses: great classically-inspired score, three whimsical and engaging good fairies, a wonderfully wicked villain (&quot;Malificent&quot;), and brilliant colors that only could be found on the palates at Disney.<br />For many years, SB had been considered one of the lesser efforts by the studio when Uncle Walt was alive, paling in comparison to &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, and even &quot;Cinderella&quot;.<br />Now, with the new re-mastering, along with the extras, elevate the film to true classic status.<br />Maybe the studio can do the same with the lame &quot;Pete's Dragon&quot;...NOT!
0671027387|1.0|This book was just like his first book Digital Fortress.  As I was reading the characters were almost the same.  He also did not do his research on the military men the things he had them doing had me laughing throughout.  I guess if your audience is not military this book is ok.  I thought it was demoralizing to say that these elite fighters would kill americans like they were robots or something. I would not waste my money on this book get it from the library for a good laugh.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|I'm probably setting myself up for condemnation from most that have viewed this film, but I just don't think it's that good. Sure, the animation is breathtaking, the voice talent is unsurpassed, the characters are quite engaging, and the movie's length is &quot;family friendly&quot;.<br />However, as appealing as it is, it lacks the witty humor that one has come to expect from Disney/Pixar collaborations. Other than &quot;the look&quot;, it doesn't seem as if this film came from the same studio that produced &quot;Toy Story&quot; or &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;.<br />Even the Aussie locale was better handled better in &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot;.<br />I actually found &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; to be a bit more &quot;literate&quot;, and I didn't really like that one.<br />Perhaps, the folk can get with the writer of the infinitely superior &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; and get it together for the certainly-to-come &quot;Nemo 2&quot;.<br />My verdict on &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;: 3.5 stars, rounded off to 4!
B00005JLKB|5.0|We were hooked on the first episode! We've read Superboy &amp; Superman comics as kids--we're in our 50's.  Clark displays a<BR>very human side as a compassionate, caring person who would help<BR>anyone he can who needs it. And he has the emotions of young <BR>people who are learning about themselves. Only he has to also<BR>deal with his new abilities that pop up at unusual times. We<BR>love that Clark and Lex are friends.  Lex wants to do good, but<BR>his bum of a father only cares about the almighty dollar and will<BR>crush anyone in his way. It's too bad that Clark and Lex eventually become enemies. When does the second season come out?
B0000DD7NL|5.0|i was wondering if Ms Keys could do it again...im glad that she did. the songs are still hot and deep, no second cd jinx here! my favorite songs are: If I Ain't Got You, Diary and When You Really Love Someone. along with &quot;You Dont Know My Name&quot;....<br />the extra dvd is cool...but i thought it would have had more of her singing &quot;live&quot;....but it was still worth watching.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|Two immediate signs of this soundtrack's success even months after KB Vol. 1's release: it makes me yearn to see the first DVD as much as theatrical Vol. 2.  Rarely do soundtracks -- especially compilations -- evoke the mood, energy and drama of a film this long after it entered theaters. Sure, it's uneven in spots, but the good more than make up for the weaker tracks:<br />Topping the list for me are tracks 1,3,4,9 and 10. Nancy Sinatra's opening \\"Bang Bang\\" obviously grabs listeners as immediately as it did film viewers -- it's the heart of both the film and this CD, and quite indispensable.  Certainly a very wise selection on QT's part, even compared to his other soundtracks.<br />As already noted by many here, \\"The Grand Duel\\" is quite haunting and a treasure from the spaghetti western genre period, building to a beautiful, poetic crescendo before it returns its lonely sunset requiem.  I can't get enough of Bacalov's track, stunning work and nearly worth the CD purchase itself.<br />Track 4 is Bernard Herrmann's \\"Twisted Nerve\\" -- a movie I've not seen, so this was a total surprise to me in both the film and the CD, yet so obviously Herrmann upon first hearing and I'm a sucker for his work. To be honest, its use in the film was fun, but I enjoy it much more when not tied to Elle's whistle-sync performance.<br />Hotei's \\"Battle Without Honor or Humanity\\" plays well with the love of a cool groove threaded through Tarantino's films -- enjoyably brash and over the top, a solid vibe for the kicking, punching, slicing and dicing to ensue.<br />Yet another treasure to discover is Santa Esmeralda's cover of The Animals' mid-60s hit \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" at Track 10.  They give it a completely different workout, turning a ballad of desperation into a snappy, clappy 70s dance club opus (running time 10:28!) infused with enough Latin flamenco fire to melt those platform shoes.  I dread disco, but this version has enough crossover appeal into now-retro genres to hold up very well, and as such provides quintessential QT quirk appeal. A track I never would suspect I'd like, but has become a favorite -- that's a good soundtrack.<br />Other tracks are short-term fun (the sound effects and dialogue bits), but wear thin much more quickly than the best music ever will. Agreed with other reviewers: I dig the music behind \\"Ode to O-Ren Ishii,\\" but RZA's wrap over it is quite sloppy -- that guy needs to back up off the mic, for one thing. But still, I enjoy the musical tension between the hip hop and the delicate orchestration underneath enough to give it a pass ... your mileage may vary. Inclusion of Issac Hayes' and Al Hirt's tracks are fun treats, and Zamfir's \\"The Lonely Shepherd\\" will definitely grow on you as his brand name kitsch-appeal gives way to the track's effective usage in the film. \\"Crane/White Lightning\\" has some electro-hipness and drive to it, but it fails to develop power or meaning over repeated listening for me -- in contrast to much of this CD.<br />Overall: a solid, stinging slice of funk and fury. Certainly in the best of 2003.  Here's to Volume 2!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Well...I would give two words of advice to listeners: 1) keep your copy of the original 'LIB' album...it's worth it; 2) OPEN YOUR MIND...<BR>This album has its faults - not enough extras/abrupt track endings/and that bizarro echo/organ/tamboura at the end of &quot;across the universe&quot; ... but it's a nice step up from the original album<BR>this is not &quot;Let It Be as it was meant to be - but it is &quot;Let It Be&quot; - enjoy it...take it for what it's worth, and if you don't like it, don't buy it...<br />(one final piece of advice...don't trust reviews...even mine...make up your own mind about this recording)
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|... but I'll start with this CD.<br />Damn, the year went very well, I bought some great music. Then I made the mistake of buying this utter piece of hyped sh... Thankfully, it's only 33 minutes long. I've played the album twice and will never ever do so again, promise. Don't tell me anyone that it would grow on me - I'd rather have some exotic fungus grow on me. <br />The songs (for lack of a better word) all sound the same, there's a lot of tuneless riffing, always the same rhythms, and the &quot;singer&quot; sounds like he was stuffed into an oil drum and recorded with a mike that's &quot;kaputt&quot;. These guys have as much musical talent as my pet guppy. It's incredible what kind of rubbish gets hyped these days, and there's always idiots (like myself) who fall for it. Another lesson learnt.
076790592X|5.0|This book is basically the outlay of Morrie Schwartz's life philosophies. If I had to consolidate his philosophy into a title, I'd call it Realistic Compassion. Morrie basically preaches, unassumingly, and advises the rest of us to live our lives more fully, more fervently, and to relax our minds and attitudes so that we may love. <br />I really enjoyed this book. Its a feel-good book with a deeper, transferrable point. I truly truly believe that everyone will enjoy this book to a personal degree.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I really think that I may be too old to enjoy this music, but I find it dissonant, boring, and repetitious.  I would rather listen to The Clash.  The lyrics may be clever, but who cares?
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence has become one of my very favorite bands (to bad there's tons of rumours that they're no longer going to exist a.k.a Ben Moody has left and they're not saying anything about it as of yet). <BR>Of course the first single I heard off this cd was &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; while I don't like rap I loved the lyrics and the voice of Amy Lee. <BR>It doesn't hurt that I like rock but can't sing along to the songs (I know...I am a dork) with male singers (especially when my voice sounds like a little girl, although I like Nickelback, Default, Fuel, Metallica,and,Audioslave and then some... it just seems wrong to try and sing along). <BR>One of the best things on this cd is the eclectic-ness of it it has hard rockish tones (Going Under) to piano ballads (Hello and My Immortal, I've actually come to like the radio version of My Immortal the best now, the guitar and drums coming in near the end sent chills down my spine...). <BR>It's obviously not for all people though since there are a few reviews that dissed it pretty bad, as for me they're a new favorite. <BR>It might help you if I list some of my other favorite bands/groups/singers in no particular order... all those bands I mentioned earlier, Shakira (even her spanish cds although I'm not a fluent speaker), Lifehouse, Alison Krauss and Union Station (I'm an odd 18 year old what can I say...), Celine Dion (although I have always loathed &quot;MY Heart Will Go On&quot;),Revis (they also had a song on the Daredevil soundtrack), Nina Gordon (she had a popular song a few years ago). There's a bunch of other ones but I don't want to bore you anymore with my droneing...<br />I'll probably be back to torture you on reviews of the musicians/singers I mentioned, until then farewell and enjoy listening to music!
B00000IQC8|5.0|Clerks is a definite gem of a movie and the first of the series in Kevin Smith of movies which go on to include Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back.  Many of the characters become recycled in the follow up films to rehash the empire of brilliant personalities.  Jay and Silent Bob are the two definate stand outs that come to be used numerous times in the other Kevin Smith films, after watching Clerks you will understand why.<br />Clerks is fully filmed in Black and White, no Dolby 5.1 surround, no special effects, not even marquee actors.  This film is totally dependant on character interaction and secondmost, the storyline.  Entertaining to the Nth degree, the interaction of the primary two characters Randall and Dante guide you through their day in the life of a Video store and a Convenience store clerk.  Along the way are many twists and turns as well as every kind of customer possible from violent, argumentative, nympho, hostile, and even one who dies in the bathroom.<br />It is impossible for me to do this film justice with my review.  Being one of only 2 other movies that I have immediately rewound and played again after first seeing, Clerks is in my top 10 list of all time favorites!
B00005A46T|5.0|Best bands ever. Anyone that thinks otherwise is weak, fragile and old school. People who criticise Slipknot are probably old school (1980-1995) guitarists or up tight bass players or something. Two words for you guys- total stiffs. Slipknot makes me happy. Slipknot makes me mad! Slipknot are CRUSHING! Worship and Tribute!!!
B0000DD7LC|4.0|True artists take time to evolve and find their niche and voice so to speak....Alicia Keys debut had good tracks (FALLEN, WOMAN'S WORTH, ETC....) but also contained about 75% filler!!!!  This album is only about 15% filler....her voice sounds superb, her piano is amazing....this cd captures much of the sound from the 60's and 70's period of soul....on the obvious standout IF I WAS YOUR WOMAN....flawless!!!  This cd flows much better than her first and is much more cohesive.....I hope the next time around she tackles more subjects than mostly just love.......she would kick butt on tackling so many social issues!!  Way to go ALICIA....MISS KEYS!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|From all the hits that I like Baby one more time,Im a slave(4u), I never bought a britney album.  Till this one really took me,  I like most of the tracks still getting into it, its great so far. Opening track me against the music with my girl madonna, just goes well to start the cd and end it.    In the zone is off the hook,Britneys has grown up here, no wonder its already at 2.million copies after just 4 weeks. IN THE ZONE get it today.
0792841344|5.0|When Mike sneaks off to spy on the funeral for his brother Jody's friend Tommy, he has no idea of the nightmare he is about to uncover at Morningside Mortuary.  The creepy Tall Man that runs the place is not what he appears to be...and who is that lady in lavender making all the guys disappear?  Phantasm doesn't really answer any questions, it just plays out with an insane dream logic as three friends (young Mike, older brother Jody, and their comic relief ice cream salesman friend Reggie) investigate the monster laden mystery and fight the Tall Man.  Writer/director Don Coscarelli squeezes maximum visual power from his admittedly silly premises and the Silver Sphere is a highlight, not to mention Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave's classic score.  Watching Phantasm today is just as much fun as seeing it for the first time back during its theatrical re-release in 1980 (double billed with another AVCO Embassy cult horror item, John Carpenter's The Fog).  The extras will be familiar to those who have the laserdisc special edition (i.e. they are the same), but any horror fan worth his or her salt will want to see this, if not own it.  An essential piece of 70s cult horror/sci-fi/fantasy fun.
B00009V7T2|5.0|You're never going to please everyone, who'd want to? TMV are obviously out to please themselves, critics be damned. Sure, this album is very complex, but incoherent? Only if you've never been weaned from the radio and hold the tired major/minor and 4/4 hierarchy as an absolute from some banal god who's heaven is filled with Thomas Kinkade paintings and Applebee's restaurants. Let's have a refresher... Schoenberg liberated remote consonance from the obsolete and inaccurate term \\"dissonance,\\" Dada liberated art from aesthetics and what has happened in the last few years? If you don't have a verse/chorus structure, major/minor key and \\"solid\\" 4/4 \\"good beat\\" percussion you're \\"too arty,\\" \\"pretentious\\" or \\"incoherent\\"... nevermind the fact that almost every pop song ever written is under the impression that the writer feels so self important that they must write a song about their life in a way that every lazy man, woman and child will be able to hum its tired formula over ad nauseum. TMV aren't reinventing the wheel like their less schooled fans believe, but they also aren't just following their influences lock step either. TMV are definitely prog first, punk second and pop thirdly... much like Nirvana were punk first and pop second, Blink 182 is crap first, pop second and punk in fashion. I can see where the overdramatization can be a negative but I think its balanced by a pretty cosmic scale that is intense but not necessarily \\"emotional.\\" So, to the detractors, they aren't out to please you, me or their fans... we are secondary... and that's why they've succeeded.
B00000099Y|3.0|I think Lateralus is much more intelligent, complex, mature and beautiful than Aenima.
6302891272|4.0|As a student attending an international school in Japan (NIS) it was very interesting to study Shakespeare's Macbeth and compare it to different movie versions of the same tragic story, the main one being Kurosawa's Throne of Blood. Each version of Macbeth; Polanski's, BBC's, RSC's, and Kurosawa's, illustrate the play from a different angle. BBC's edition is rather boring compared to the other adaptations for it consists of just the actors. Scenery and props are scant. The RSC version modernizes everything (the clothing, weapons, and housing), but the language is kept to Shakespeare's exact wording. Personally I felt that Polanski's rendition ran parallel to Shakespeare's vision and execution of the play. The time period is correct and Macbeth's transition from an honorable man to a murderous, power-craving beast is depressingly realistic. The blood, guts and fear in Polanski's version is exactly what the victims would have experienced and is dramatically shown on the screen. As for the Throne of Blood, the way Kurosawa takes an Elizabethan play and converts it into a Japanese tale of chivalry, power, treachery and murder is simply amazing. Certain elements of Shakespeare's play have been modified to better exemplify the Japanese culture. The three \\"weird sisters\\" or witches, who prophesy to Macbeth, are changed to just one unisexual spirit in Kurosawa's version, for in Japan witches with pots and potions do not exist. Although Kurosawa's version is black and white, the contrasts are so clear that even the bloodshed is nauseating. Camera angles are carefully thought out so that low-level shooting represents social positions, and close-up shooting causes the audience to feel the pain that the characters are experiencing. And where many may fear that the essence of Shakespeare and his Macbeth may be lost when translated into Japanese, Kurosawa--through the strength of the Japanese actors' voices and their body motions-- maintains the same themes of deceit, honor, blood and supernatural powers that is so strongly felt in the original play. I especially enjoyed studying Macbeth from many different viewpoints and I highly advice those who have not had the chance, to take the time to compare two impressive renditions (Polanski's and Kurosawa's) of Shakespeare's Macbeth.d and supernatural powers that is so strongly felt in the original play.

B0000640VO|1.0|Amelie was a big disappointment to me.  The story started off very strongly and I was looking forward to seeing the rest of this film.  However, after everybody telling me to watch this film, I did and thought that it is vastly overrated.  Maybe, I thought this film and the main character would be 'deeper' than it was.  This film is basically a film about how a boy gets to go out with a girl - as simple and as predictable as that.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|It's about time that someone made a CD that sounds like they are having fun and has great music from the first song to the last song. There is not one boring song on this CD. When I heard this CD on the Radio I knew I had to buy it.<BR>Many of my freinds and Co-Workers have heard this CD and now they want it. The thing is, it is sold out on the store shelves.

B0000UHFC6|5.0|Is there anything as moving as a great movie score?  When music brings the emotions of a movie to life, it almost becomes a character in itself.  Howard Shore and co. have done another terrific job on this final installment.  Beautiful and stirring instrumentals combine with immensely gifted vocalists.  Billy Boyd's voice is surprisingly angelic.  And Annie Lennox's song at the very end makes me weep every time.  Absolutely fantastic.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna, in the 1980's, with the exception of LIKE A PRAYER has been primarily a singles artists--her full-length albums were good, but often saddled with subpar, filler. This album is great because it eschews the filler and sticks to the hits -- and few artists racked up as many as Madonna, so many in fact, that some were omitted from this collection.<BR>The early hits were brilliant post-disco dance pop, especially the sublime \\"Holiday,\\" with its optimistic chorus, and enthusiastic delivery. Also good is the iconic, Motownish \\"Like a Virgin,\\" and the excellent \\"Get into the Groove.\\" Her late '80's work, was a bit deeper in content, \\"Like a Prayer\\" a good example of this. The collection has an edited version, that is just as effective as the oringial(much more dancier than the original). Also great is Madonna's peak single, \\"Vogue\\"-- a beautiful dance song, that manages to convey Madonna's compassion and soul, this time an homage to the Black and Latino gay subculture that created the dance craze the song is title after. The two new songs are also excellent, hits in themeselves. \\"Rescue Me,\\" contains one of Madonna's scariest full-throated singing, in which she testifies with the gospel-like chorus, and at one point channels Aretha. The rumbling \\"Justify My Love,\\" is an excellent erotic boudoir anthem. A brilliant overview of the most prolific point of Madonna, one of the most prolific singers of the past 20 years.
0783230893|5.0|This movie gets high marks in every category for faithfulness to the original book by Fannie Flagg. Kathy Bates plays an ignored wife just trying desperately to get her husband's attention. She visits her mother-in-law at a nursing home, but the nasty old woman throws things at her and she retreats to the community room to eat candy from her purse - and there she meets a lonely old woman (Jessica Tandy, so you just KNOW how good this movie will be!) whose tale of a lifelong friendship between Izzy and Ruth (Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker) begins to help Bates change her life.<BR>The story of Izzy and Ruth is told in flashback, back to the days during the Depression when they ran The Whistlestop Caf by the side of the train tracks in a No Place little town in Georgia. The relationship of the two women to each other, to Ruth's son and her abusive ex-husband, to the African-American figures who carry epic roles, and to the families involved on both sides of the color line. It's a story of triumph over huge odds, of love and friendship, of personal growth and ultimately of dignity.<BR>And it's funny as all get-out. Highest, highest rating.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|I loved the cinematography in this movie. It gives the effect of actually being there. Also unusual was the fact that there is no music or score to this movie except for the closing credits. The director of this movie was going to take a lot of heat no matter which point of view he took. I thought that the movie perhaps made assumptions regarding the British troops which were a little unfair, but at the end of the day the overall story of the movie is 100% accurate - British troops shot 26 civilians, killing 13, while suffering no casualties themselves.
6305079811|4.0|The Queen soundtrack is the best thing about the movie, but it has its charms.  Sam Jones is hopelessly miscast, but a great Ming can make up for a lot.  Infinitely better than the tv series, not as good as the Buster Crabbe serials.  The best Flash Gordon is in the comic strips, of course, many of which are now in print, especially the Alex Raymond originals and the great Harry Harrison and Dan Barry stories running in Comics Revue Monthly.  There was also a pretty good animated Flash Gordon tv series.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|It would be very easy and reasonable to include this album as best of the year just because the man died, and he deserves every imaginable tribute for his contribution to popular music. It may seem puzzling to some that an Argentinean like me would dig a Country legend as much as I do. Well, I've been hooked on Johnny Cash's voice ever since I heard Lay Lady Lay in Dylan's Nashville Skyline. Although his voice no longer has the power it once did, it remains able to express the deepest meaning and tone of these songs, in certain cases in ways not mined before. A voice, possibly, even more moving and vulnerable because of the strain audible in his voice, due to his illness.  Listen to Hurt for the most stunning example of this.
B00006EXL5|5.0|MCR has a really good cd, there isnt one song on there that sucks. They are also really cool guys, Mikey (drummer) signed my bastard t-shirt, and we talked. The second time i saw them Gerard (singer) held my hand during Vampires will never hurt you. I've loved them since the first time i heard them and i will always love them they are the best around. There coming out with a new cd.
6300216209|4.0|Erich Segan wrote a short little book in the late 60s with a short little title - and scored big.  The film adaptation in 1970 was equally successful, a heartbreaking romance that seemed to be just what the country needed at the time.<BR>Ryan O'Neal plays a law student who married Ali MacGraw (both of them looking impossibly young and innocent) against the wishes of his rich and powerful father (Ray Milland). Then comes the diagnosis of MacGraw's leukemia, and the rest is history. It's uncomplicated, sophisticated, moving, and definitely a tear jerker. Don't miss it; it'll get under your skin and you'll want to watch it again.
B0000UJL96|5.0|After the disappointment that was Star Trek V, Star Trek II director Nicholas Meyer returned to the helm to bring us this final journey of the original Trek crew.  Star Trek VI finds the Federation attempting a peace treaty with the Klingons, but soon Captain Kirk finds himself framed for the murder of the Klingon's chancelor.  This is the kind of classic Trek thats fans yearned for, and Meyer uses the same formula he had with Star Trek II mixing intelligent storytelling with a Shakespearian space opera, all of which makes this installment light years beyond the dismal Final Frontier.  Excellent casting elevates the film as well, including a scene chewing Christopher Plummer as the Klingon Chang, David Warner as Chancelor Gorkon, a pre-Sex in the City Kim Catrall, and a cameo by Christian Slater as an officer on the USS Excelsior.  Paramount has thankfully (and finally) released a Special Edition DVD of the film, packed with all the extra's it deserves.  Hopefully now they'll have the good sense to give Generations, First COntact, and Insurrection the same treatment.
B0000DZ3EA|3.0|some marvelous music here but i prefer the stuff he did in the 70's with Genesis and his early solo albums which are not featured here. He has collaborated with many artists throughout his career like sinead o connor,Kate bush, Daniel Lanois, Tony levin and a bunch of African artists. A lot of his materiel needs time to registar. Bit weird.
7119005901|5.0|I'll admit, I purchased this novel because of the addictive Playstation 2 games put out by Koei that are based on the Three Kingdoms story and characters.  Even being relatively familiar with the characters and plot, I found the novel to be very difficult to digest, if only because hundreds of characters are introduced (and often killed or left behind) every few pages.  The storyline is vivid and interesting, and this is an excellent novel.  This version is very helpful due to extensive endnotes and a preface and afterword that fleshes out the background and meaning of the novel.  I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in political and military adventures, but you should be prepared to invest substantial amounts of time in reading it.
B000001IQH|4.0|This is a seriously good album and I say that without being influenced by any hype because when I came to appreciate it, I didn't even know that Rancid had ever had commercial success.  These guys know a melody from a hole in the ground, have thrashing punk energy and don't include a single lemon on this long CD.  Who cares if they are successful?  People buying an album doesn't make the album worse.  Who cares if they are derivative?  They derive from the best, The Clash, and besides, *most* punk is derivative.  Who cares if they have a certain artificiality?  The Sex Pistols were a prefab band and The Clash's howling Joe Strummer was from the middle class rather than being the pleb he pretended he was.<br />  OK, so Rancid think that it's 1977.  OK, so Rancid think that they are English.  The great news is, if all you had to go by was the music on this album, you might think so too.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Earlier in the year, I offered a review of the video tape edition of this film.  The version contained elevator-type music, as the original Nelson Riddle soundtrack was missing.  Riddle could not agree on terms price for the original score with the movie studio.  Riddle's estate evidentally has done so so the original score has been restored to the film.  <br />Many reviewers asked that the original score be considered for any re-release.  Well, on the 30th anniversary of the film, here it is..&quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; with the original soundtrack.  Thank you!<BR>Fitzgerald would have been pleased with the adaptation and the accompanying soundtrack.  It is obvious how much of a difference the music makes in contributing to the overall experience.<BR>The DVD is not to be viewed in a context of pure entertainment.  It is a relevant story about the desire to possess what one does not have, regardless of the cost.  The script is taken directly from the key points in the text.  The film has a dream-like quality due to the utilization of a unique lens.<BR>If one seeks an action packed thriller, this is not it.  The film is for the romantic and sentimental.  Anyone who has sought someone or something only to lose it all in the end will be able to relate.  The song &quot;What'll I Do&quot; underlies Gatsby's insecurity.  Redford and Farrow make a wonderful Gatsby and Daisy.  As for the script, it does contain some lines which could be considered corny in our present time.  The script, however, is incorporated DIRECTLY from the novel.  I have read the text more than 25 times.  <BR>In 2002, I viewed the movie at Rosecliff mansion in Newport, RI, where several of the scenes were filmed. The version presented was the one without the original score.  What a disappointment!<BR> <BR>As an educator, I use the film to provoke several questions.  Among these is the Estella-like (Dickens) character of Daisy...why is not Daisy content with Gatsby?  Was it merely a whirlwind romancewith Gatsby deceiving himself as to Daisy's feelings?  How often do people in our society nowadays do the same?<BR>I would provide more detailed substantiation in support of this version, but as I am serving in the armed forces in Iraq, I have little computer access.  I really appreciate the release of the DVD, especially in time for Christmas.  At least it will make Christmas just a little better for this one soldier in the war.  If you are a romantic, sentimental, reflective person, you will enjoy this film.  For those of you writing negative reviews, may I respectfully suggest you reconsider your remarks in consideration of the restored soundtrack?
B0000CNY27|4.0|John Carpenter's dark dystopian vision of the future would become an instant classic and introduce us to Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell), a one eyed bad-ass sent to the maximum security prison of New York in 1997 to rescue the president.  Escape From New York is pure B-movie comic bliss, and it doesn't try to be anything else either which is partly what makes the film so good, even to this day.  The cast is excellent as well, and includes many Carpenter film alumni with Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes, Season Hubley, Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Atkins, Charles Cyphers, and the always babe-alicious Adrienne Barbeau.  MGM finally had the good sense to release a Special Edition DVD of the film that fans have longed for for years.  The long deleted and talked about opening scene is here, and the commentary by Carpenter and Russell is worth the price of admission alone.
B000002U8G|5.0|This is the ultimate Pink Floyd experience. Imagine traversing the depths of the sea or gently falling through the clouds, your body at rest and your mind at ease. This album evokes imagery of these things. It's great for relaxation and singing along, extremely catchy, extremely memorable. I can never get enough of it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this show on Fox when it was on,  and couldn't resist buying it when it was released.<br />It's some of Wheddon's best work.  The cast &amp; crew are incredible,  and the premise is impressive.  <br />IMO,  the only reason this show isn't still on the air is because Fox kept airing episodes out of order,  and pre-empting them without warning.<br />This show is easily some of the best TV in years,  ranking up there with Buffy,  Angel,  and Joan of Arcadia.  It needs to be brought back,  it's obvious to me that it would succeed.
B000001FN3|4.0|I am not terribly experienced at reviewing music, but this is a beautiful album with which to begin.<br />'Tales' is a quest for the laudable goal of reinterpting some of EAP's well known works as music. This album has been a personal favorite for more than 15 years. I wore out a vinyl copy before the advent of the compact disc. I own 2 copies on CD so I have one in the car as well as in the home stereo. Alan Parsons managed to combine the musical stylings of seventies 'soft' rock with writings more than 100 years old at that time.<br />The opening track, 'Dream Within A Dream', is an instrumental track that lulls the listener into this genre album.  It opens with Orson Wells reading a Poe selection.  Wells' voice is a perfect fit with Poe's works.  That track melds beautifully into the second track, 'Raven'.  <br />'Raven' is the adaptation Poe's most famous poem.  The beat and bass are enrapting.  Rather than focusing on a complex melody or rhythm, a simple but strong rhythm is laid down behind a mechanized voice singing selected lines from the poem. &quot;Nevermore, nevermore, never&quot; will resonate in your mind long after the final track has been played.<br />An eerie interpretation of 'Tell Tale Heart' follows. The screaming, frantic vocals certainly impart the urgency of the inspiring story. I do not know if the effect was deliberate or not, but it is in stark contrast to the earlier tracks (which were virtually soothing). This track begins with a wailing cry that truly disrupts the earlier flow. I have always suspected that was the intention of the band from the start.<br />Next is 'Cask Of Amontillado'. A good effort with a great story. It carries the spirit of the story well, with a melancholy tune and almost disheartened vocals. It also carries the confusion of the protagonist well.<br />The 5th track is certainly the greatest on the album. 'Doctor Tarr &amp; Professor Feather' takes it head from a contagious rhythm and underlying vocals. &quot;Just what you need to make you feel better&quot; provides a vocal rhythm that sets the stage for a great melody. One of Poe's greatest stories, this was a natural choice for special attention by the band. If you have missed this story, go to your library and read it. It is a gem as is this track. The din of noise from the story is carried to perfection within the song. Unless the listener is familiar with the story, it might seem a little enigmatic.<br />The next five tracks are instrumental and comprise 'The Fall of the House of Usher'. It is an adequate effort although a little disappointing when compared to the other tracks.<br />'To One In Paradise' rounds out the album. This is a beautiful track that truly conveys some of the emotions of EAP. I believe the great author himself would have been enchanted by this gentle tune and soft vocal treatment.<br />In summation, this is a unique effort from a talented group. It falls a few inches short of perfection with the lengthy 'Usher' section, but aside from that is flawless. If you enjoy EAP's writing, or APP's music this belongs in your collection. If you do not enjoy EAP you might forego this addition.
0061015725|2.0|This would have been a nice idea for a short story but there wasn't enough rising action for a 500-page paperback novel.  The first 140 pages had good intrigue with the mysterious behavior of the protagonist's wife toward him and their family, but the middle part of the story was stretched way too thin.  It became a formula man-versus-monster sci-fi tale with the nano-particles playing the part of the monster created by the evil government defense contractor. The story picks up speed again in the last 100 pages as if Crichton realized that he had enough filler for the 500 pages needed by the publisher and he could get on with completing the story.<br />Crichton is good with biological and medical details and he's done his homework on cutting edge computer technology, but some of his technical explanations in the fields of electricity, magnetism and physics fall flat for the reader who truly understands these sciences. The literary quality of this novel is standard for modern fiction: one-dimensional characters who get angry and curse each other a lot in the most common type of profanity; this is how the author shows drama.  Good drama and intrigue require more complicated character development.  If only Michael had used that 360 pages in the middle for something more constructive.<br />Michael Crichton has paid his dues as a sci-fi writer.  He's written many novels, none of them very good except &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; which made him a star.  He can now rest on his laurels knowing that anything he grinds out will be a hit and will probably be turned into a screenplay.  If you like shallow sci-fi thrillers that you can speed-read any time and anywhere, you will be well-served by this book.
0375432302|1.0|By the middle, I knew who the Teacher was and exactly how the story would end for Sophie's \\"family,\\" all along I was one step ahead decoding the clues, and I was bored with the boy-meets-girl, good vs. evil paint-by-numbers plot.  Thrill me it didn't.

It was a fatal flaw to say the Bible was not reliable because it had been passed down by fallible men who bent it toward their own agendas.  His credibility evaporated in that one premise early on.  Contrary to his assertion that there is evidence the scriptures have been compromised through time and translation, scientists and archeologists have discovered the original stone and papaya writings are identical to our Bible today.  Do you really think that, if there is a God, He would allow his Word (or message) to be thwarted by men, evil or otherwise?  If He created the universe and everything in it, doesn't it follow that He's certainly capable of protecting a vital message's integrity?  (Now you owe it to yourself to check out Chuck Missler's \\"Hidden Treasures: In the Biblical Text.\\" hidden treasures and \\"Cosmic Codes: Hidden Messages  cosmic codes, et al.)<br />And, if there is a God (a creator) and Jesus was not He come in the flesh to fulfill every prophecy in the Torah Shebiksav (the Written Torah) and the Torah Sheb'al Peh (the Oral Torah), WHY WOULD ANYONE WORSHIP A SPOUSE OF HIS?  If Jesus was just a man, OK, but that makes his supposed wife just a woman.  Duh!  I found it very frustrating that such a self-acknowledged academic \\"expert\\" as Robert Langdon would not address that basic philosophical question, but turn around and \\"explain\\" the corruption in the Roman Catholic Church.  According to Brown's logic, passing down a \\"truth\\" by word of mouth, songs, fairy tales, and artwork is only reliable when done by those protecting the \\"real truth\\" of the sacred feminine.<br />I threw it away.rk is only reliable when done by those protecting the \\"real truth\\" of the sacred feminine.<br />I threw it away.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Wow!  This one is going to be hard to follow up!  I saw them live three times, once on the Mutter tour and they are truly a spectacle to behold and sound awesome.  Very true to their finely produced studio work.  <br />The CD...Every song on here is likeable at the very least.  I liked most of Sensucht, but this blows it away!  Very compelling and great replay value!  I continue to listen to it over and over again.  It will be hard to take out of your CD player to be sure.  <br />They've done something wonderful these crazy Germans...They've created a new blend of music and to me, it's some of the best out there.  Catchy, heavy, and thought provoking.  Not to be missed!  Catch them live when you can, you won't forget it!
1878424319|5.0|Many of those critical of this work seem not able to put it in perspective. If you've read Castaneda, it's obvious that Ruiz lifted the main terminology from him. It is also fairly established that Castaneda was a liar and made it all up. That said, Ruiz is to be commended for what he has made-interpreted from Castaneda's works. That any of this actually came from the Toltec's is highly doubtful and instinct and common sense should make that readily evident to you (Unless, your a terminal romantic new ager). Yet, and yet... Ruiz has indeed made a relevent contribution to dealing with issues of fear and shame and communication. It's not even that it's unique, I have pretty much formulated/had the very same insights, minus any Toltec dressing up. It's like Emerson said, something like, when we recognize our own insights in a book like Ruiz's we think it is great, brilliant even, and we sort of discount ourselves. Anyway, that's obviously not a quote. Ruiz is mostly a poetic, hermeneutic, visionary, catching the Castaneda drift. Peter Lamborn Wilson has written about how certain teachings, or lineages, even if not true, or legitimate in terms of succesors etc. can end up being true through drifting over time and geographically etc. Well, although Castaneda's revelation hasn't travelled far geographically (from the U.C.L.A library to Mexico), something useful and true is evident here. Just don't take the magical-mystical side to literally, but rather read poetically and sensitively and with common sense and you might appreciate Ruiz's effort. It's all in the poetry baby! Listen to the silence between the notes. And don't worry about the guru, or aliens, or historical revisionism.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Well Jet is one of the very very few new bands that i even like, with todays music all rap and country and hip hop. now some people dont like the thought that most of these songs are covered but i have to say they do a very well job of doing it. today it's rare to heard a band do a lead and jet actually has enough talent to do so. maybe their next album will be all original and Get Born was just done to see how fans would react to their sound. and if they last i can really see them getting better with time as all bands do. hopefully jet can carry on rock'n roll before people lose sight of it, and again it is a great album.<BR>                     <BR>~Livin On Rock'n Roll~
B00001U0GQ|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen. I love the historical content. The music is excellent as well as the story line. Daniel Day-Lewis is at his best....!!
B0000048V8|5.0|I watched this video for the first time when I was a very young child and always enjoyed it. Over the years, I grew up and forgot about it and how much I enjoyed it... until a teacher showed it to my class again in 8th grade. I instantly remembered the movie and fell in love with it again. It brought back such warm memories of my childhood that gave me a strong sense of peace. Ever since then, I have watched it once a year around Christmas time, along with &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;. I hope that I watch this video every single Christmas for the rest of my life. I can't wait to share it with my little ones so that they can enjoy it as well. The music is absolutely fantastic and part of the reason why I love it so much. So, to possible buyers... Please buy this for your children! It will be something that they enjoy and treasure for the rest of their lives, as I have!
0375432302|4.0|I was given this book not having known anything of what it was about. After reading it I must say that I am intrigued not only by the book and how it was written but by the historic details documented as part of the story. Do Da Vinci's works all have so many hidden meanings and allusions? Were so many prominent individuals throughout history members of the Free Masons or related groups? It's all interesting stuff, to me anyways.<br />Some may be turned off by the writer's characters, and the fact that certain revered and &quot;untouchable&quot; organizations are the antagonists in this story. The writer at times seems biased against the Catholic church, while being biased for the Free Masons and other lesser known groups. It is my feeling however that the writer's ultimate point is about having faith and not relying on the systems any religious institution created by man imposes artificially.<br />One thing I will say of the book is that it charges strong for the first seventy percent, and you'll never want to stop. After that however, it gets weaker and ends somewhat unremarkably. But, it's still worth a shot, and is a quick read.

B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is a thrash metal classic. It's very fast and very heavy. If you're a thrash metal fan and you don't own this, go out and get it now! This, along with Master of Puppets, is one of my favorite Metallica albums.<br />Fight Fire With Fire: Starts out with a slow and clean guitar intro, but quickly becomes fast, heavy and dark. This one has an extremely fast main riff and is one of my favorites off of this album. 5/5<br />Ride the Lightning: This is one of my least favorites off the album, but it's still quite good. 4/5<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls: This song is short, slow and one of Metallica's simplest, but it's still very heavy and easily one of my favorites. 5/5<br />Fade to Black: This is probably my least favorite ballad from Metallica, but it's not bad at all. 4/5<br />Trapped Under Ice: Although it's fast and energetic, it's really not one of my favorites. 4/5<br />Escape: This is a very underrated song. It's very strong and has an awesome chorus. I wish Metallica would play it live, but if I remember correctly, they (well, James at least) don't like it. 5/5<br />Creeping Death: Very fast and heavy song. Based on the movie \\"The Ten Commandments\\". This is also one of my favorites. The solo in it is killer! 5/5<br />The Call of Ktulu: Instrumental song. Very thrashy and heavy, yet melodic at the same time. This is the longest song on the album, but it doesn't get boring at any time. The title came from the short story \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" by H.P. Lovecraft. 5/5<br />Overall, Ride the Lightning is an awesome thrash metal album that any metal fan should have in their collection.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears presents the world her last treat, a CD entitled \\"In the Zone\\", featuring brillantly produced new songs. Surprisingly, most of these are far from presenting immediate appeal aimed at her teenybop cult following. As it is more than doubtful that she intended in any way to turn her back to her fans to attract a more mature audience, it is musically clear to our ears that, together with the people behind this project, she must have wanted to express evolution, both as a young woman and as an artist.<br />Brightly and skillfully written, crafted and produced, \\"In the Zone\\" graces our ears with a string of good songs, with the few comparatively weaker tracks ranging high above the average songs  that are usually referred to as \\"fillers\\" on other contemporary releases. No two song sound like each other, and none of them are produced in the same way. And although there is an unheard continuity, with each song evolving into another, this is not blatant to the listener.<br />As may be understood though, the arrangements do reproduce the best sounds that the public may want to hear today. The smart listener will certainly recognise the various influences on this Cd. There is nobility in emulating the very best of the musical pop world and blending it into this excellent recording. The songs from it do not appear to have been build up primarily for hitting the top of the charts, which will give to many enough reasons to criticise the album. But this should not (and will not) deter the wannabe listener from liking \\"In the zone\\".<br /><br />The big surprise from the Cd though is not that it is a good one. Every positive person should have expected that! With \\"In the zone\\", Britney Spears take us on a journey where she sings in our ears to please, entertain us, make us dance and feel good. Her singing abilities are better than ever before and her so apparent ease shows that she must be having the last laugh.
B000001FA4|1.0|I Bought this cd because I kinda liked the song &quot;Pride&quot;, boy was I Disappointed!  It was not the music, it was Bono's voice.  After about a half hour, I had to stop listening to it.  It was so bad I had to stop eating my dinner and take an aspirin for my headache!  Bono is about on the same level as Paul Stanley from Kiss (as far as vocals go)....He just doesn't know when to stop moaning like a walrus!
B000099T2L|2.0|Let me tell you, this album sucks ass.  I can't believe she was nominated for 8 grammys.  That IS rediculous!  The only song, well, I'll say two, that are good are crazy in love and baby boy, but even those aren't THAT great.  She has an okay voice, I actually think Kelly Rowes sings better than her.  Anyhow, this girl is too overated AND this album.  Christina Aguilera can top her any day, songs and voice.  I recommend Stripped to this album.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Let me add to that.....total pants! Judging by most of the other reviews, I believe I'd have to start partaking in illegal narcotics to like this movie, let's face it, something must be altering their minds to actually like this big steaming pile of bollocks!!! Decent soundtrack though, that's worth the one star!

B0000D14JV|4.0|My original fear of this movie was that Jamie Lee Curtis would play an incredibly stupid older woman when she switched identities with her daughter.  Worried that she would just act silly and do really stupid things, I was at first skeptical abou this title.  It's also a classic with the great Jodie Foster, and those classic Disney movies are tough to remake.  However, if you watch the old version, the mom, in her daughter's mind, makes her daughter seem like a stupid teenager, and it just gets annoying.  I was surprised that Jamie Lee Curtis was able to pull off acting like a teenager while still being able to hold some credibility.  For the one thing that would have gone terribly wrong is if she portrayed the teenage mind as silly, ignorant, and downright spacey.  Her performance keeps the fantasy aspects of the movie at bay with the reality of the real issues.  It's not an Oscar-worthy, cutting-edge film, but it's really fun to watch and a great remake.
B00005OM4N|5.0|To tell you the truth I still listen to this album to this date! this is a great album it has this type of style to it that is so original I call this album a good solid POP album that has realy good songs!<BR>and if you are intrested in to pop songs check this out.
B00005JMCT|5.0|I gave this movie 5 bright stars for keeping right in line with the other American Pie flicks. The original cast of characters pull off another great performance. If you liked the first 2 in the series then without a doubt you will love this one (as it on the same premise). <br />Also, girls an added feature for us- since we like love stories with happy endings- they actually get married and have a commitment to each other. But guys don't worry because it does not distract from this largely hilaroius movie. I would have to say I luaghed more during this than during the other 2.<br />The ONLY WARNING I have for those thinking about buying this movie is that just like the other movies within the series, it is not meant for children or young teenagers who cannot grasp it's concepts or tell the difference between true life and fiction. The language and overall tone of the movie is jsut not sutied for the young or immature.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|This is a very good buy. It contains most of Donna Summer's classic singles, which cannot be faulted one bit. Those missed out include 'Walk away', 'Cold love', 'The woman in me', 'There goes my baby', 'Dinner with Gershwin', 'Love's about to change my heart', the list goes on. All her 14 (to date) pop top 10s are included, as are gems like 'Could it be magic', 'I love you', 'State of independence' and the 1999 Grammy nominated 'I will go with you'. Talk about career longevity.<br /><br />Also included are 2 new Giorgio moroder productions, the mid tempo, plodding Euro pop of 'That's the way' with Donna sounding breathy and girly, and the ambitious hi energy dance anthem 'Dream-a-lots theme' with it's slow intro, and soaring vocals. Both bound to be classics.<br /><br />The bonus cd contains extended mixes of 'I feel love', 'Hot stuff', 'This time I know it's for real', 'Dream-a-lots theme', and another new track, 'You're so beautiful' which is a sexy tribal dance anthem with a killer chorus. What it needs is a radio edit. Beautiful!!<br /><br />The cd notes are really good too with a very good biography, excerpts from her book 'Ordinary girl: The journey' (I recommend it, go get it) and even chart positions of every song, makes you appreciate what a chart phenomenon Summer is. There are also 7 colour photos including 2 rare shots taken during the 'On the radio' and 'Another place and time' photo sessions.<br /><br />Now, all we need is that elusive new studio cd...
B00006LFGD|4.0|I just received the Duets CD as a Christmas gift and it is the best album that the incredble Streisand has ever offered her fans.  I hate to admit it, but when I leave the house, I take the CD to play in the car and when I get home, I take it out of the car and back inside to play again.  I can not get enough of this INCREDIBLE collection of timeless duets.  I have a 8 speaker Bose stereo in my Concorde and everyone looked as I pulled into a local Dallas service station with Judy and Barbra singing.................I am sure they probably could have heard them in Houston.  I can't get enough of this CD...the movie album was disappointing, but this more than makes up for it.  I bought 6 CDs for friends and hope that more of the classical Barbra is still to come.
B000055ZB8|5.0|(This review is for the Eureka version available in Australia)<br />A horror film nowadays is a genre film, generally not meant to be taken seriously. That is fine. But &quot;Nosferatu&quot; is a quite different type of film. <BR>The film exudes German Expressionist style. While not, perhaps, as breathtaking as the bizzare imagery in Lang's &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;Nosferatu&quot;'s imagery is quite unforgettable, and often unsettling.<BR>My favourite scene is not among the famous scenes on board the ship. It is the scene where Hutter/Harker looks out of the door of his room, and sees Nosferatu standing there, stark and stiff, at the other end of the room outside. At first the audience cringes at the sight of Nosferatu unmasked; but the touch of genius is that the frame fades into a zoomed-in version of the same image - and Nosferatu IS STILL STANDING THERE...I think this is the only scene in any vampire film (admittedly I haven't seen many) where it is made symbolically clear that a vampirew is in fact an undead corpse. Nosferatu' stiff movements as he advances on Hutter also make him seem &quot;dead&quot;. <BR>There's also, of course, the most famous shot in the film, in which Nosferatu rises from his coffin like a stiff, dry Egyptian mummy. Again Nosferatu is emphasised to be really, really dead, and this is horrifying.<BR>The reactions of Nosferatu's victims are also telling. My favourite is the scene where the captain ties himself to his tiller - then in a closeup we see his reaction to his first dight of Nosferatu. His terror is very underplayed, but since we have already seen the wildly hysterical reaction of his crewman, it is all the more horrible. Then there is the reaction of Hutter/Harker to the vampire, in which he literally grins with fear, then crawls into bed, completely paralysed with horror, looking like a frightened mouse or rabbit.<br />The &quot;supernatural&quot; quickness or jerkiness assoiated with the vampire is also effective, and somehow works better than the modern special effects in Coppola's film. Everyone knows about the freaky fast carriage that Count Orlok drives - a very very primitive special effect that is still eerie. The jerkiness of the carriage makes it seem, not merely fast, but possessed. There's also the scene where a jerky, superfast Orlok piles up coffins in his cart, then gets into one himself, then causes the coffin lid to jump on top of the coffin. Again, the primitive undercranking/stop motion makes the image jump unnaturally, producing a strange effect.<br />Nosferatu is a film with many memorable or disturbing images, which seem so original, even by todays standards, that it is no wonder the film is still so famous.<br />THE DVD - The Eureka edition of the DVD is both good and bad. <BR>Good: The soundtrack by Art Zoyd is modern; but it is much better than it could have been. Admittedly I am not sure about the rap-style music that plays when Nosferatu is carrying his coffin around Wisborg; but aside from that the music is very appropriate, with whining electronic sounds, windy noises, slams, and organ music. The music when Nosferatu is advancing on Hutter is particularly good; the howling, screaming voices when Nosferatu's carriage turns into a &quot;negative image&quot; is also wonderful. <BR>The intertitles are well-translated, though they could be less corny. I would not have translated one intertitle as &quot;it is creepy on the other side of the river&quot;...but who can forget the description of Mr Knock? &quot;He paid his people well...!&quot;<br />Bad: The CGI intertitles are too technologically slick for the disc, looking too contrived. <BR>The tinting is nice; but for some reason all the scenes have been tinted sepia; the original British cinema release on which this is based had proper tinting, as well as the Art Zoyd soundtrack.<BR>Furthermore this is not a perfect transfer. I admit, Nosferatu will probably never look perfect, thanks to problems with the loss of the negative; but there must be better transfers than this grainy, spotted one. <br />Overall the Eureka release is OK, and since it's the only version available in AUstralia, I suppose we have no real choice here!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I can honestly say, this is the BEST CD that I bought in 2003. And I purchased several. Alicia's debut was no fluke, and this CD proves it. Every time I put in in my CD player, I play it through at least twice. Sometimes 3. It's just that good. Better than SIAM. R&amp;B at its best!<br />No matter what anyone says, Alicia has the talent, the spirit, and the voice to do many great things. This girl really loves music. Alicia's confidence and passion about her work really shine through on &quot;The Diary of Alicia Keys.&quot; Add this CD to your collection and you won't be disappointed.

It is one of the few books that I would say are essential read for anyone who calls themself a programmer! (It would be nice if some managers would take the time to read it also)<br />This book is old, but yet it is not out of date! The advise it gives is timeless. Oh how much better the worlds codebases would be if more programmers were to read this book! Good job Mr. McConnell.

0780626966|5.0|I recently purchased the NOES Box Set at Walmart, payed about $70 for it, and I have yet to crack the seal on this baby, but I can already tell just by reading all the features & extras that this DVD has to offer, the $70 I paid is a bargin. When I first saw the DVD set it was $100 and I wanted it bad, I mean it just blew me away, but at the time I couldn't afford, now that I've purchased it, I am thrilled. I thought when I got The Godfather DVD Set 2 years ago it was best ever, well this might just topple that, so for all you horror nuts & NOES fans if you don't have this DVD box set, get it! It's worth every penny, in my opinion.<br />-MMF
067158037X|5.0|Right from the begining, from the first word I felt the power of the story.  It is captivating and shocking at the same time.  Did I know all that before?  I guess I did.  Did I care?  I guess I did not.  And now I feel as I was shaken by a very powerful hand and my eyes have opened.  Ireland and the Irish blaim the British for all their troubles but they should blaim religion for that first.  Poverty, ignorance, alcoholism and the general misery should be all attributed to religion.  <br />This book is quite well composed and it transferres you to the real depth of the human tragedy.  Hunger, death, the numness...  Men say a lot of promising words but they cannot keep the jobs even if they have one.  Catholics, Protestants...  What the difference?  One drinks his wages away and another one take care of the family...  Is that the difference?  This book raised so many questions in my head.<br />Yes, I think we all should read it.  This is an important book.
B000031WD9|1.0|this movie was funny in the raunchy sort of way, and what can we throw in behind the raunchy humor to sell? drum roll please.....TEENAGERS! yes yes its true. American Pie was the grand high priest of teenage stupidity in film making. This movie was completely revolving around stereotype the entire time. It excluded the unpopular students, the ones who didnt dress in old navy and what not, put the spotlight on perfect looking teens played by 20 year olds and made the music department in high school look like one big frickin joke!<BR>The humor could be spotted a mile away, you put teens and beer parties together and what do you got? high schoolers dedicating their pathetic little lives to going around and screwing as many people as they can. It was bad enough the movie sucked, then again the actors in the film(except for eugene levy)would never make a cent in a movie that didnt included high school and college experiences(which nowadays is basically partying)<BR>i heard Jason Biggs tried doing the broadway version of The Graduate and completly blew! wasnt suprised at all.<BR>so if you want a good intelligent comedy that doesnt set its plot around teenage sex, Ed Wood, Welcome to the Dollhouse, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and A clockwork orange is what I recommend. dont give these filmakers and actors money for this half-baked meaningless crap.
0440234743|3.0|A millionaire dies leaving his ethically-challenged children and grandchildren with only enough to pay off past debts and leaves the rest to an illegitimate child who is apparently in the Brazilian jungle. <BR>A recovering alcoholic is sent to seek her out and have her sign the appropriate paperwork.

B0000AQVCL|3.0|The album is actually pretty good. But since they're so blatant about ripping riffs from other artists, I decided to get a burned copy from a friend rather than purchase it. I mean, why pay for what's already stolen?
0385508417|4.0|The story is about a couple who decides to make a change while their daughter is away in Peru in the Peace Corps. They attempt to avoid the enslaving Christmas traditions that have always been a part of their lives and do something for themselves for a change. With growing opposition from friends and neighbors, the Kranks soon realize how difficult &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; will really be.<br />This story is written in Grisham's easy-to-read style without the heavy crime or law drama. Surprisingly enjoyable.
B00005JLXE|1.0|In the pantheon of American superheroes, Daredevil (alias Matt Murdock) resides somewhere between Captain Planet and Danger Mouse (translation: total loser). He possesses enhanced senses and extraordinary strength and balance, but he generally uses his powers to battle a barrage of cranks and mobsters who could easily be dealt with by local police forces. He claims to represent justice and honor, but he has no qualms about recklessly slaughtering anyone who rubs him the wrong way. He is forced to endure blindness, mass ridicule and the deaths of loved ones, but he never manages to exude the vulnerability that make heroes like Spiderman and Batman such enduring icons. And unlike Spidey and Bats, he has been granted a film so joyless, tasteless and unappealing that only a fringe group of comic book fanatics and action junkies will find themselves exiting the theater with feelings other than disgust and dismay. <br /> <br />After a maudlin prologue establishes the title character's unique situation (the usual equation of radioactive material + murdered relative = pissed off superhero), we are introduced to a lawless city where only the vigilante Daredevil (Ben Affleck) stands between order and chaos. Chaos is pitifully represented by Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin, who commits his evil deeds and enjoys his stylish designer clothing in cheerful ignorance of his lack of personality and motivation. When he requires assistance he calls in Colin Farrell's Bullseye, a marginally more interesting fellow who gets his kicks by stabbing people in neck with items you can buy at Staples. As our hero confronts these diabolical forces and engages in a mind-numbing romance with the feisty Elektra Nachios (a beautiful but boring Jennifer Garner), director/writer Mark Stephen Johnson combines a penchant for unimaginative special effects with a love of gratuitous, sickening violence. Innocent people and minor scumbags are stabbed with walking sticks, thrown in front of trains, beaten within an inch of life and even choked with peanuts, often without regard for the plot or the sensitive stomachs of the audience. The carnage is so intense that it diminishes any joy in seeing good triumph over evil and mires the film in gloom and hopelessness. <br /> <br />At the center of this travesty is Affleck, an actor whose incredible popularity still remains a mystery to me. In film after film, he comes across as a smarmy, mumbling dolt who can barely keep his eyes open long enough to grasp the plot at hand. As Daredevil, he lacks the basic charisma, passion and intensity that the character requires to succeed, and is ultimately as dynamic as the cardboard cutout of himself that advertised the film.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|Well Angelina Jolie did it again, she fulfilled her goal of making a complete badass chick sexy, which isnt very easy mind you. I mean how often is it that you see a badass look good, like never.<br />Anyway Tomb Raider, the first movie is a little well to much like the game. I mean you have nothing really to look forward for, that is the difficulty about remaking a story you dont really know how to do it<br />The first movie is about lara croft completing her fathers work in making a way to go back in time. But you know how it is, competetors bad guys, swinging from the ceiling, kicking swat team ass, same old same old.<br />I thought this movie had no chance but it sort of did so it was a little suprising, watch this then the sequel.
B0000B1OFL|2.0|The Italian Job has all the ingredients of a slick, stirring action adventure. Based on the classic 1969 caper of the same name, the film places an emphasis on the dazzling car chases, intricate gadgetry, and high-octane explosions that routinely stimulate moviegoers. The provocative story (concerning the efforts of a group of high-tech thieves to steal the gold of a treacherous former comrade) provides director F. Gary Gray ample opportunity to delve into the intriguing themes of vengeance, greed and moral bankruptcy. Even the Los Angeles setting grants the movie a glitzy mysteriousness that seems to promise grand excitement and clever invention.    <br />Unfortunately, these potentially glorious elements never come together to form the excellent movie that The Italian Job should have been. The blame rests primarily on screenwriters Donna and Wayne Powers, who frequently leave their characters hunched over computers discussing strategies or sitting in hotel rooms and restaurants telling ridiculous stories about themselves. Consequently, the momentum of the film frequently stalls and very little heisting actually gets accomplished. Also troublesome is the casting of lead actors who fail to instill their characters with the intensity and liveliness they need to be effective fictional creations. Mark Wahlberg is particularly disappointing as Charlie Croker, the leader and mastermind of the thieve group. Charlie is supposed to exude wily cunning and repressed rage as he plots against his enemies, but Wahlberg can barely muster the energy to squint his eyes at those he doesn't like. Charlize Theron looks equally bored as resident safecracker Stella Bridger, often fighting sleep as her character confronts personal tragedy and physical challenges. Most surprising is the mediocre performance of Edward Norton as Charlie's nemesis, the diabolical Steve Frezelli. Norton is one of the most versatile and charismatic actors currently working in Hollywood, but he fails to supplyFrezelli with a single quirk or nuance that might render him more than a typical screeching villain. <br />Despite these considerable flaws, The Italian Job is not without its human charms. Seth Green, Jason Stathem and Mos Def all turn in humorous and stylized performances as the other members of Charlie's gang, and the touching cameo appearance by Donald Sutherland as an aging safebreaker might be worth the price of admission alone. But at almost $9.00 per ticket, even Donald would understand if someone went elsewhere for more thoroughly satisfying entertainment.
B000006E4C|5.0|Steve Reich is a composer who I admittedly just recently discovered, and know very little about.  On the whim of a recommendation from a trusted source, I ordered this album.  Thank God for recommendations...<br />This album is performed by 18 musicians at the top of their games.  This album is melodic, haunting, lush, groovy, complex.  You cannot argue with Reich's intricate, interwoven melodies on various mallet percussion, piano, woodwinds, and voice.  The melodies lay on top of each other and zigzag between each other for the full length of this brilliant work.  You would think 60+ minutes of instrumental music put in one song would be dull, but there isn't a single dull moment to be found.  This piece is as catchy as anything on Top 40 radio, and yet the genius and nuances are always there to be found, every time you listen.<br />The music is pretty hard to describe.  As I mentioned, there are only 18 musicians on a handful of instruments.  Reich's composition sees instruments entering and exiting with melodies that zigzag between, under, and over each other.  The intense dynamics of the crescendos and decrescendos gives certain parts an almost electronic feel.  This, along with the aforementioned layered entrances allows the piece to build, until it drops off about halfway through...and then starts again.  Throughout all of this, there is the mallet percussion vamp that the song starts with in \\"Pulses\\".  This music dances, it is alive.  Each subsequent melody is as catchy as the last.  The music will demand your attention and lull you into hypnosis at the same time.  It is like a dreamlike trance put to music.  It ebbs and it flows.  It grooves.  It must be heard to really understand, but it is awesome.<br />There's so much I want to say about this album, but I'm not really sure how.  It has completely blown my mind.  It is the ultimate fusion of artistic vision, musical genius, and accessibility.<br />True 5 Star Album.  Highly recommended for all.
0743216458|5.0|While filled with action, heroism and an epic scope, like all of Ambrose's work, BAND OF BROTHERS suffers from a curious fault- it is written by a historian who holds so much reverential love for his subject that he doesn't really know how to edit. This is really a small matter for admist all the minutia (which does often bog the central narrative down in footnotes), Ambrose does the men of Company E proud and captures their stories in many heartbreaking first person narratives spanning from basic training to VE day. <br />This singular aspect will stand as the late Ambrose's greatest contribution as pop historian- he etched in stone the oral history of the 20th century's greatest generation.<br />While broader in scope that THE MEN OF COMPANY K (an even greater WW II history that is now sadly OOP), BAND OF BROTHERS does often lose the immediacy and intimacy required of an oral history that former title so expertly captured.<br />But I am only splitting hairs, BAND OF BROTHERS is a must read deserves a spot on any history buff's shelf. A contemporary classic history.
B000003TAW|4.0|Hmmm so i guess that weezer has become one of those bands that ur only cool if u like weezers old stuff....wich is a shame because they are still good...however there old stuff is also great, as seen (or heard actually) on this album.<br />Goin back to what i said earlier i find it funny how people say that Weezer has become a sell-out or they play them on mtv to much so they should get this cd when they were &quot;underground&quot;...i laugh at them because they are obviously little kiddys that dont know that they obsessively played &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; more than i could count.(everyone that is old enough to buy smokes will agree with me on this).<br />BLAH now that i got that outta the way this album truly is a masterpiece(like there next album &quot;Pinkerton&quot;).You dont really get old of this album at all..although like i said &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; is good maybe the first 2 million times u hear it.<br />Best tracks:Everyone likes &quot;Undone&quot; or &quot;Say it aint so&quot; but take it from me the real beauty on this album is &quot;My Name Is Jonas&quot;.I also love the song &quot;No One Else&quot; cuz i can relate to it SOOO much.But in all honesty i really didnt find &quot;Undone-Sweater Song&quot; to be all that great....its stupid how they have people babbling incoharently for the versus.But this cd is hard to dismiss that almost every song is catchy as hell.<br />Bottom Line:Well 5 stars means Flawless...wich most people forget and they just throw out 5 stars for anything.And 3 stars means average/little above average wich this cd deserves a little more.so im stickin to 4 stars.<br />I would suggest buying &quot;Pinkerton&quot; before this album and i would also suggest lookin into &quot;The Green Album&quot; since its basicly a version of &quot;The Blue Album&quot; but its just alittle bit consistinly catchier than &quot;Blue&quot;.<br />All in all no one can excuse the fact that this album is a classic debut from a great band.It is recommended to anyone that likes what weezer dishes out.
B0000DIXRU|2.0|The only good thing about this album is the wonderful cover. There are too many ideas and styles here and none of them are mature enough to be considered for an album. This sounds like random selected Anathema songs that did not make it on to previous albums. This cd is boring just like A fine day to exit was. If they listened to it Beavis would probably turn to Butthead and say hey you fell asleep dude. Sounds a lot like Radiohead in many places. Progress and innovation is good but can't it please be in the direction of Judgement? Even if you are a hardcore fan this album will still disappoint you.
B000069HKH|4.0|Excellent music.<BR>Springsteen is a songwriting genius, but what people seem to have forgotten is that it was released TOO SOON after 9-11 to have been written about it. If that isn't enough proof, check out Springsteen's interviews about the album. He created a five star album, but because too many people are incorrectly calling it a 9-11 tribute disc, I am going top take away a star it very rightly deserves.
B00009RDG9|1.0|All the negative reviews that this pathetic film is garnering are very much to the point.<BR>   Not only are two great actors puzzling with their appearances in such a sorry flick but there seems to be a worrying trend in casting good actors in bad films lately.<br />   &quot;Hunted&quot; is nothing more than a rip-off from the 1st Rambo film with more...knives.  There is just an excuse for a plot (and a bad excuse at that) and there's practically minimal dialogue as it would be close to impossible to adapt any meaningful dialogue to an almost inexistent storyline.<BR>   Speaking of that, the plot is basically about an &quot;unnofficial army trainer&quot; (T.L Jones) who goes after one of his most prized &quot;students&quot; when the latter &quot;loses it&quot; and starts chopping up people up in the mountains where he's found refuge after a blurry involvement in...Kosovo has made him a walking psychological trauma.<BR>   From there on the barrage of cliches is unrelenting. The &quot;killing machine&quot; who cant be caught unless the &quot;teacher&quot; tracks him down. The &quot;killing machine&quot; who evades scores of police cars in the most unlikely circumstances and butchers up other trained- and multiple in numbers- cops, agents, etc.<BR>   The ingenuity of the &quot;killing machine&quot; who has time enough -as does his teacher- to construct a knife from scratch while being in hot pursuit by half the poilice force and the FBI in his area.<BR>   And so on and on and painfully on.<BR>   Of course, any b-movie is better than this because, at least, a b-movie doesnt take itself seriously. &quot;Hunted&quot; does and it becomes all the worse a film for it.<BR>   I'd thought, silly me, that Hollywood had given up making braindead films like this. I'll think again then, thank you.<BR>   Avoid it like the plague.
0385504209|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this book because a friend  told me that the book was about cryptography, symbols, and religion. I was disappointed by all three aspects. The shoddy recycling of religious urban myths is bad enough .... And the low-brow treatment of crytography was annoying too: mirror-writing and crossword-type puzzles is about as sophisticated as it gets. But at least, after 450 pages, the author could at least given the novel a satisfying conclusion. The author leads us to the brink of something satisying but leaves us hanging at the end. This is the worst book I have read in a long time.
6302891272|4.0|With fierce samurai warriors clad in heavy metal armor and ebony haired ladies in kimonos, gThrone of Bloodh offers everything that one would expect from a historical Japanese film, yet, its uniqueness lies in the fact that this is veteran director Kurosawafs adaptation of William Shakespearefs master epic gMacbeth.h As a highschool student attending Nagoya International School in Japan, I found this odd mix of Shakespearean literature and ancient Japanese culture quite fitting. This film portrays a warrior Washizu (Macbeth) and his ambition to be the Lord of Cobweb Forest Castle led by his manipulative wife, Asaji (Lady Macbeth). The scene change from Europe to ancient Japan does not affect the main ideas or the plot of the original Macbeth. The infamous scenes where Lady Macbeth (Asaji) is washing her hands and the banquet scene with the ghost of Banquo (Miki) are still there. The lack of Shakespearean language is well substituted by the old Japanese language (which even a fluent Japanese speaker as myself could not fully understand.) The cinematographic effects spice up this black and white film. What I found most stunningly significant was Kurosawafs use of weather. There is rain, lightening, sand storms, and fogs. The uses of these weather elements bring out a dark and creepy image of the overall story that is shared with the original gMacbethh. Also, this movie has some other cinematographic effects that only a black and white film can bring out. Evil and good, supernatural and natural are brought out by the salient contrast of black and white. For example, the witch of Cobweb Forest is surrounded by white smog and fully clad in white, which is most striking against the black, murky forest. Toshirou Mifune (Washizu) gives a tour-de-force performance as the Japanese Macbeth; his facial expressions, large movements, and voice most appropriately conveys the turmoil and ambition that Macbeth was faced with has he struggled to reach to the top. Although this movie may seem gtoo oldh and uninteresting to some, it has been a self-broadening experience for me, for it has exceeded all of my expectations from a black and white movie and given me a whole different view of Shakespearefs gMacbeth.h gThrone of Bloodh may not exactly be gfun for the whole family!h but it is a classic worth watching.
B000002H92|4.0|Great live disc.Always come back to it.Great sound for a 1991 release,and good bang for the buck.The Lizard King sizzles on this,as does the band.Wish they had included the soft parade.Well worth hearing this If you,have all,or most of the studio records.ALL HAIL THE AMERICAN NIGHT!!

B00009W0U4|1.0|I didn't like this movie at all.  That doesn't mean that you won't though.  I don't know you or what you like.  Maybe you like the kinds of movies I like and maybe not.  So really it's all up to what you like and not what I like.  But if you are a friend of mine you probably won't like it because I only pick friends who like the same movies as I do.  So if you know me and are my friend then I would say you wouldn't like this movie.  Or maybe you will which just shows you that I don't know you at all.  I think we can still be friends though.
B000002UDB|1.0|Fool on the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know....are there 4 worse consecutive songs on any other Beatle album?<br />Well, Rubber Soul tries (Think for Yourself, The Word, Michelle, What Goes On) and Revolver makes a run at it (Eleanor Rigby, Love You To, I'm Only Sleeping, Here There &amp; Everywhere) as well as the White Album (Piggies, Rocky Racoon, Don't Pass Me By and Why Don't We Do It in the Road), but Mystery Tour is likely the worst.<br />Buy the various greatest hits compilations, which enable you to hear songs like Magical Mystery Tour and Strawberry Fields without having the lesser tracks.
0441009425|4.0|I had some difficulty getting into the book because of the time-shifting. But once in, I was hooked. Reynolds has a vivid imagination and a great eye for detail. I bought his view of the Ultra spacefarers and liked the way he populated his book with anti-heros.<br />Why not five stars? The ending had a lot of aspects that were simply too pat. It was good, but somehow missed that step into great. I'll be looking forward to reading his next novel, however.
B00000K3UU|5.0|Let's keep this simple-Adam Sandler is my favorite actor, and this is one of the best movies ever.
B00005JMFI|1.0|It looked like the actors in the movie were putting all of their trust in the director becuase they had no trust in the dialogue, which was terrible. The story line is jolting, the characters poorly developed, and the humor weak. Will ferrell does a decent job and so do the other actors but they have so little to work with it's a lost cause.<br />I thought their was a really funny scene in the movie with a great performance from the actor who played the outside author the firm hires to write for them. Good job! Wait for it to come out on video.
B000051Y0G|5.0|I don't want to repeat the previous reviews of this seminal early '80s pop masterpiece -- Cyndi has a great voice and great matching material, some of which she co-wrote (and she contributes a couple of odd-ball but fun songs, too).  Many many top 10 hits.  What's starting to bother me about this album is the synthesizer parts -- they get cheesier and cheesier the more times I listen.  I'd almost like to have the vocal tracks without all the production.<br />If you don't already own this album and (somehow!?!) aren't familiar with the hits, you might take a listen to the clips before buying.  But &quot;Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot; is the #1 anthem on my '80s hit parade and no one but Cyndi Lauper will ever do this song true justice...reason alone to own this album.
B000001GXB|5.0|First of all, if you're a Beethoven neophyte still trying to pick up the basics and wondering whether his late sonatas are worth getting, I have one thing to say to you: drop EVERYTHING.  You need his late piano sonatas, and you need them now.  Not only are these works profoundly emotional in the way his late work almost always was, but they're technically dazzling and so inventive that later composers were still exploring the avenues he'd opened up for almost a century.  In the monumental Opus 106 \\"Hammerklavier\\", Beethoven managed not only to write a piece so difficult that even the great virtuosi (except for Pollini, and that's one of the many reasons to buy this recording) tend to make a few mistakes, but also to practically invent Chopin in the process.  In the Opus 111, the very last one, not only does Beethoven bare his soul with as much emotion as this tormented composer ever revealed, but in the process he blows apart sonata form altogether, does some things with rhythm in the second movement that wouldn't get picked up again until jazz came along(check out about 6:30 into track 8 if you don't believe me), and makes a shimmeringly gorgeous farewell, making those 20 minutes the best 20 minutes of piano music I'm aware of.<br />Pollini, never faulted for his almost-inhuman technique (as I said before, check out the Hammerklavier), is sometimes called unemotional because his playing is so razor-sharp, and because he refuses to let his playing fall into the trap of over-sentimentality.  There are times this is true, mostly when he plays late Romantic works, which are SUPPOSED to be a little schlocky.  Beethoven, though, is a different story: the paradoxical composer who managed to have all the power over structure of the Classical era before him, while using that incredible control (much like Pollini) in ever-more-innovative and personal ways to produce works evoking depths of emotion beyond anything that had been heard before.<br />What all this means, for this recording, is that Pollini manages to pull off the same paradoxical feat as Beethoven: having all the virtuosic skill, all the sense of the logic of these pieces, while pulling out some terribly profound feeling from these works.  He does it by being so faithful to the score that, as one reviewer below did, you could read along without ever noticing a deviation from the composer's extremely precise directions (including some faster-than-traditional tempi that, in my opinion, make these works a lot more interesting than the wishy-washy feeling of performances by people like Kempff).  On the other hand, this supreme grasp of the technical aspects leaves Pollini free to play it _naturally_, with the unexaggerated but supremely poignant emotion of someone who simply lets the music flow through them.  Highlights include, well, everything, but especially the Opus 111(perfection!), the Hammerklavier, and the Opus 101.  Truly a master performance, and I've never heard better.
B000055XMF|5.0|When &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; first came out in 1979, I think most people were expecting a &quot;Tommy&quot;-like rock opera, with music by The Who blasting from the speakers and Roger Daltry playing pinball adorned in a mask. Much to most people's surprise, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; is a story about teen angst in England, with background music by The Who. The story is the key, and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; details the historic Mod/Rocker riots of the 1960s. The riots were fueled by teen rebellion, rock music and a youthful generation seeking its identity.<br />The beauty of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; is the film's themes of youths trying to find their place in the world is timeless and internationally identifiable. You don't have to be a British lad to love this story. Several scenes are so emotionally harrowing as to be disturbing. The protagonist Jimmy Michael Cooper (brilliantly played by Phil Daniels) begins to self destruct as the movie progresses. He loses his home, his job, his girlfriend and eventually his identity in a haze of drugs and misguided motivation. The scene where he begs his ex-girlfriend to explain herself, to which she answers &quot;It was just a giggle&quot; will bring a tear to most eyes. It is the saddest form of rejection and as emotionally truthful a scene one is most likely to see.<br />I think many teenagers eventually go through a process similar to what is seen in &quot;Quadrophenia.&quot; One's identity when growing up is always related to the music, the parties, the mode of dress and the friends one chooses. The world is seemingly yours. As the Mods begin their march in Brighton, chanting, screaming, arms wrapped around one another, they are a force. They can change the world. So when the world rudely interrupts the dream, as the police break up the riots, as people move on to the next day, one uncomfortably realizes it really was all just a &quot;giggle.&quot; <br />This is the sad quandry Jimmy Michael Cooper must confront. When watching &quot;Quadrophenia,&quot; specifically the final scene where he rides the stolen scooter along the cliffs of Brighton, you're never sure what choice Cooper is going to make. <br />The Mods most certainly fueled the eventual punk movement, and I think many people who love this film came from that 1980s generation. The clothes and the hairstyles (including Sting, in an early role as the coolest Mod) are identifiable to the punk generation. What Jimmy Michael Cooper eventually confronts is similar to the conflicts of the punk generation (or any teen generation for that matter). Sadly, the movement must be left behind and we must ask ourselves what the meaning of it all was. To reach maturity, many of us must travel the same path of Jimmy Michael Cooper - and he's faced with some difficult choices.<br />The Who produced this film, and they must be applauded (as should director Franc Roddam) for creating a classic work about teen rebellion. The music of The Who, including &quot;The Real Me,&quot; &quot;Love Reign O'er Me,&quot; &quot;Bell Boy,&quot; and &quot;I Am the Sea&quot; has been expertly used throughout. &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; is a great film not just because it details British teen angst, but timeless, international teen angst.
B000002J20|5.0|I can remember being told as a teenager that in order to understand YES you needed 1) to understanded &quot;Tales&quot;, and 2) to have serious drugs handy.  Call me old-fashioned.  I opted for #1 and ignored #2.  I took the two vinyls home and played it on my record player with headphones on.  I did not get it, although I could feel the pure mastery of craft.  So I listened again.  Now I was understanding the lyrical interplay of voices and instrumentation.  And yet I still was wanting.  So I listened again.  Now the thread of the plot line was forming, and the incredible instrumental riffs and wriggles were arching seamlessly with the lyrics.  All tolled I believe it was 5 straight listens in my bedroom with the headphones on before it was etched on my brain as an indelible frame.<br />I want to say I always loved Yes.  I cannot say this, with their later tragi-comic demise and their bowing to the great God of green.  However, whenever I stoke up &quot;Tales&quot;, I am once again transported to the self-realization of 7-8 hours of listening, absorbing, and growing that came with the initial drop on the turntable.  No, this is NOT for the 90125 crowd.  And it may easily be called pretentious.  But just let yourself be submerged in the music, without distraction, and it will challenge, it will expose, it will teach...
B000001OAA|5.0|So what is one to think when the producer of Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" teams up with some old musician friends of his to form a grunge band and then recruits a relatively unknown female Scottish redhead with a syrupy voice and saucy attitude to be the lead singer? If your guess is that the band produces absolute garbage, you are CORRECT! But this band is anything but trash. Since 1995, Butch Vig, Duke Ericson, Steve Marker, and Shirley Manson have been providing an escape from the monotony that dominates radio airwaves. \\"Garbage\\" the band's self-titled debut is one of the most amazing musical experiences there is: where other music is poppy, happy, and easy on the ears, Garbage is an angry, pulsating message of sexuality, vibrance, and emotion encased in scraping guitars and electronica.<br />SUPERVIXEN: One has to wonder if Shirley Manson is talking about herself with this one. The guitars are really crunching in this song and the verses create a perfect tension that comes exploding out in the lyrics of the chorus.<br />QUEER: This one is quite eerie and seeing the video only makes it more so. Everyone has their own interpretation of what this song is about but there is a general consensus that it is creepy. \\"I know what's good for you... I know you're dying to... You can touch me if you want...\\"<br />ONLY HAPPY WHEN IT RAINS: The quintessential song about depression, ironically set on the background of relatively peppy music. Shirley almost sounds peppy when she teasingly asks you to pour your misery down on her.<br />AS HEAVEN IS WIDE: A very dark and raspy song that deals with betrayal; this one expresses everyone's deepest and most vicious revenge fantasy.<br />NOT MY IDEA: This song is kind of playful and dangerous at the same time. I think we can all empathize with the staccato repeating chorus, \\"This is not my idea of a good time, this is not my idea of a good time...\\" <br />STROKE OF LUCK: The beginning to this song has the sound of wind blowing. This and MILKhave the distinction of being the only two slow songs on the album. This song also deals with betrayal but with a touch of sadness as opposed to anger.<br />VOW: This is the type of song you want to play in your car with the windows rolled down. It's a real standout on its own. There's something mesmerizing about its anger, \\"I came to knock you up, I came to shut you down, I came around to tear your little world apart, break your soul apart.\\"<br />STUPID GIRL: A nice, steady song with crunching guitars that is easily accessible. Very catchy. This one was a hit single.<br />DOG NEW TRICKS: A very abrasive song that deals with depression but from a less emotional viewpoint. I think everyone has uttered Shirley's groggy, \\"I wish I had not woke up today\\" at some time in his or her life.<br />LOVER'S BOX: For some reason, this track isn't very memorable for me. There is something kind of cliché about the chorus, \\"Send me an angel to love\\" and I can't imagine Shirley Manson and family ever trying to get to heaven.<br />FIX ME NOW: This song has always seemed very poignant to me. There is something about the retro guitar chords harmonized with Shirley's sad and enfeebled lyrics that really does take one down to Shirley's level and can understand the tearing plea of the chorus.<br />MILK: Don't even try to guess what this one is about. It's a very good song though and it commences the tradition of the last song on a Garbage album being the slowest on the album. The chorus is extremely haunting: \\"I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you.\\"<br />Essentially there is no point in listing my favorites for this album because virtually every song would qualify. Butch, Duke, and Steve's music in conjunction with Shirley's perfectly sultry and powerful voice inflect this album with an energy and emotion that stays with the listener long after the songs have stopped playing. I used to compare this band to No Doubt, but now I can't understand where I got that idea. Garbage has no comparison,it speaks for itself. Garbage is a band which straddles the lines, refusing to be labeled as pop or grunge or electronica or anything except what it is. It is also worth mentioning that they not only fulfill but surpass their lethal promise on their sophomore album VERSION 2.0.
B00000IP3S|5.0|It's difficult to pick out a favorite Blind Guardian album(they're all great), but this has to be the one for me.  The sound of this one is like a bridge between the thrashiness of the earlier albums and the sound on Nightfall.  It's the perfect balance.  It's also further proof that these grandfathers of power metal are at the top of the game and sound like no one else in the genre.  Many like to complain that Hansi's vocals are the downfall of the band while others worship him.  I guess to be totally accepted as a power metal vocalist you have to be another Michael Kiske clone.  Let me set this straight:  Hansi is one of the best and most important heavy metal vocalists ever-right up there with the ranks of Rob Halford.  Now, I'm not saying &quot;best&quot; in terms of singing ability exactly, but in regards to intensity, originality and emotion.  He sings every song as though it's the last time he will ever sing.  He's obviously very in love with his lyrics coz he sings and shouts with such a passion that you can't help but get excited along with him.  Even if he's singing about dragons and elves, you can't help but getting enthused by the subject matter because of how it's presented.  When he cries, &quot;I will wait and guard the future king's crown&quot;, you are 100% convinced that Hansi will indeed wait and guard that crown!  My hat's off to him.  And that's just the vocalist-the band is in top form(as usual) here as well.  Andre and Marcus still play their butts off here.  I really enjoy Thomen's drumming.  Drummers in power metal bands usually get as much recognition as country music drummers, but Thomen is a special exception to that rule.  I would most certainly notice if he were gone.  I envy most other countries who get to see these guys often, while I have to sit here and watch Korn ooze through my town regularly.  These guys would be a top act in Middle Earth though.
B0000UMD00|3.0|What should I say?  I bought this album only because it's by Pink.  Let's face it - it's not the best album from Pink by far and I hope it is the worst ever will be.  Let us pray for a better one as a follow-up to this one, amen.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I enjoyed this cd. Now that Norah is more main stream hope she doesn't become too &quot;poppy.&quot;  Her voice delivery makes me feel comfy - kinda like I'm taking a bubble bath or sipping hot chocolate with half-melted marshmellows floating on top.<br />The lyrics are visually and emotionally driven on this CD and they stay with you.  &quot;I wanna wake up with the rain falling down on a tin roof while I'm lying safe in your arms &quot;.... Just beautiful.
B00005RFVL|5.0|This is a CD that can make you laugh and make you cry within its playing time.  Robbie's best album by far.  Favourite track - Mr. Bojango
B000002UDB|5.0|&quot;Magical mystery tour&quot; is a pure classic and genius.From Lennon's haunting power of &quot;i am the walrus&quot; to paul's gentle and catchy &quot;Hello goodbye&quot;.From psychedelic &quot;Blue jay way&quot; to lovely sixties pop in &quot;Penny lane&quot;.no weak songs.the most important (or if not the best) rock band in history.the beatles.millions of people around the world can't be wrong tellin that it is a masterpiece along wiht their other works....and it is.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm ashamed to say this, but this was the last Radiohead CD I bought. I wish I hadn't been so hasty to give Hail to the Thief 5 stars, because this one is far superior. <br />Airbag - Great intro, as usual. Different from the other songs, but still great. I love it when Thom sings &quot;I am born again&quot;, just the combination of notes is really...just great. Great song.<br />Paranoid Android - Very memorable. This 6 1/2 minute long epic song is one of the highlights.<br />Subterranian Homesick Alien - Meh. Pretty good.<br />Exit Music (For a Film) - Don't really understand this song, pretty haunting melody. Love the last lines. &quot;We hope that you choke, that you choke, that you choke...&quot; Great.<br />Let Down - Very beautiful underrated song. Absolutely LOVE the ending, with the duet. One part singing the chorus, and one part singing &quot;one daaaaayyyyy...you'll know where you aaaaaaaarrrreee...&quot; Beautiful. One of the three best songs on the album along with Karma Police and No Surprises.<br />Karma Police - Another great song. Also love the ending. Great lead in for the next track.<br />Fitter, Happier - Holy S***. This is some pretty disturbing stuff. Really spoke to me.<br />Electioneering - Unusually normal-sounding. But still pretty good.<br />Climbing up the walls - Another disturbing one. Has an &quot;I am pure evil&quot; feel to it. Creepy.<br />No Surprises - Best song on the album, hands down. I can't explain it. It's just pure genuis. Beautiful, peaceful, perfect.<br />Lucky - Ok song. I don't know, after listening to &quot;No surprises&quot;, this one seems kind of...I dont know. Still pretty good.<br />The Tourist - Typical for a closing song, I think. Kind of depressing.
B000002L71|3.0|the new extended version of this album is really worth extra money as one of previous reviewers said.i grew listening ti this version but new one has many songs more that are important too.<BR>Talking heads mixed funky pop with quirky social commentary and some psychedelic atmosphere to create their own distinctive sound.\\"Burning down the house\\" or \\"Once in a lifetime\\" are the best examples.<BR>of course \\"Stop making sense\\" (album was recorded live.the self-titled movie was about the same live concert as on cd) is essential for any respectable music fan but the new longer mix is more good for the added tracks and improvement in sound.get new \\"Stop making sense\\" along with \\"True stories\\" or \\"Fear of music\\".they deserve to be listened
B0000AI44Q|3.0|If this was just the DVD I'd give it 5 Stars. These songs are acoustic and were meant to be acoustic...so the DVD stands tall. However the CD sounds uninspired in comparison; especially given the fact that he's using Crazy Horse here...one of the best friggin' rock bands of all time. It sounds like he took Crazy Horse and put a muzzle on it. There's none of what makes Crazy Horse great here. There's none of the pounding sloppy guitars...none of the emotion of that band.<br />Bottom line....if you're going to use Crazy Horse, USE CRAZY HORSE!!!!
B000006NPY|5.0|This album can be a shock for anyone who knew Pumpkins before from hard edged rockers like &quot;Bullet with butterfly wings&quot; or &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;.&quot;Adore&quot; is a very dark,electronic driven album that combines minimal rock style with avantgarde poetic ballad and electronic pop.heavy guitars can be hard to find here even with a candle...Billy Corgan who in this era was one and only definitive leader of band (he throw out drummer Billy Chamberlain and polished James Iha's guitar parts,replacing many of them with...keyboards) made this album his personal diary,a very instrospective piece of music.<BR>the gentle beggining &quot;To sheila&quot; fades into heavy &quot;Ava adore&quot; with industrial beat and huge bass riff.still hte melody is very catchy.songs like &quot;Appels and oranges&quot;,&quot;Crestfallen&quot; or &quot;Perfect&quot; can be simply called inteligent electronic pop (guitars can't eb found easily here).moving &quot;Shame&quot;,&quot;tear&quot; and &quot;Behold the nightmare&quot; are creating a feeling of endless fear and loneliness.&quot;Blank page&quot; is one of the most sad and touching pieces of music ever created (although it is based only on few piano chords)...in general &quot;Adore&quot; is beautifull album but it is not recomended to listen to it when you are depressed.it contains too much sadness in it.<BR>if you are opened for good music and you don't mind that one of the most shining alternative rock bands had totally changed their style here than you will have just stunning piece of emotional and melancholic music.great to listen in winter when you are alone at home with good book,or if you only want to flow with the music...
B000002GFC|5.0|It's good that the CD's of innovators like Cream are still around. Although their existence was short, their mark in music history was incredible. They fused metal riffs, bluesy passages, folk tunes, and awesome solos with their trademark reverb and psychadelic atmosphere, as well as introducing the wah pedal along with Jimi Hendrix. This CD captures what the psychadelic 60's were all about. It also marks the birth of the legend Eric Clapton, whose solos never fail to amaze, with the unmistakable distortion of the 60's. All, in all, must-have for any music fan.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This cd is nothing short of incredible. This album showcases the pinnacle of the bands strength: doing different songs in completely different styles but always managing to sound like the same band. For instance, no one can argue that the trippy new wave sounding Parallel Universe or the slow tear inducing Scar Tissue sound anything alike but it is always evident that its Red Hot. The Peppers have always had the tightest rhythm section around, and while Fleas basswork is not particularly accentuated on this album it is always present, as well as Chad Smith's infallible rhythm. Practically half the album has become a staple of Modern rock radio, and this album resolidified the Chilli's place in rock. Standout Tracks: Around the World, Emit Remmus (or Summer Time, whatever) Easily, This Velvet Glove, Savior, and Right on Time. Do yourself a favor and buy.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD I was a little dissapointed. I was looking forward so much to having more Lord of the Rings score to listen to because I have listened to the other two soundtracks so much I`m getting tired of them. At first all of the tracks seemed unclimactic and short, but this could just be because it was 11:00 at night after I had gone to see the movie and I possibly wasn`t paying the closest attention. But now with multiple listens the music is really growing on me and I really can`t go without listening to it for a while.<BR>The tracks that I did love from the very first listen were the early cues containing the Gondor theme. Tying with the theme of the fellowship, that is probably my favorite Lord of the Rings theme (out of almost fifteen, if you`ve counted). Combined with visuals in the mind of the beautiful white city of Minas Tirith, tracks like &quot;The White Tree&quot; are absolutely breathtaking to listen to.<BR>There are other tracks that have simple beauty and sadness like &quot;Hope and Memory&quot; and &quot;The Steward of Gondor&quot;, though I will not babble about that one because I`m sick of people rating this soundtrack high just because Billy Boyd sings on it. Watch the movies if you just like Billy Boyd. Buy this CD for the music.<BR>There are a couple complaints I do have about this soundtrack. There are a couple extremely noticeable moments in the movie soundtrack that are not on the CD. During the battle in front of the black gate and Frodo and Sam`s climb up Mount Doom there is a most powerful version of the fellowship theme which is accompanied by a loud choir, which has never been done before with that theme and which sounds amazing. I can`t even fathom how they would leave something like that out in the editing process.<BR>I also enjoyed Renee Fleming`s parts on this score, but thought she was a little overused. In the previous soundtracks there were certain voices associated with different themes and situations,but Fleming sings practically every solo part. It gives an individual personality to this film, but destroys the variety of voices. I would rather that Howard Shore had brought back other unique vocalists like Isabel Bayrakdarian. But at least there`s still good old Ben del Maestro, a remarkable boy soprano singer who has &quot;appeared&quot; on both of the other soundtracks.<BR>And &quot;Into the West&quot; also takes a couple listenings, but is a beautifully composed song. The lyrics, in addition to being about the gray havens, can even express an optimistic view of death. I think this is the best of the three songs of the trilogy. I thought Enya`s song was very weak with background instrumentals and &quot;Gollum`s Song&quot; was kind of corny, though a good melody. &quot;Into the West&quot; is a very moving and memorable song.
B00005LMBK|4.0|First of all, if you are planning on buying this cd to hear songs like Clint Eastwood, forget about it. Only one or two other songs on the cd are similar at all. At first, that made me hate this cd. I'm glad I changed my mind. (If you like the rapping parts in Clint Eastwood, they are done by an artist known as Del The Funky Homosapien. He is very good, check him out.) Anyway...this is a really solid cd. The influences are very eclectic, drawing from Brit pop and Electronic and mixing samples to boot. This is one of the albums that need to be listened to as a whole, but some standouts are Clint Eastwood, Sound Check, Dracula, Double Bass, 19-2000 (featured in a cingular wireless commercial i believe), and Rock the House.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This CD is just like Alicia....beautiful in every way.<br />Favorite joint gotta be &quot;If I Ain't Got You.&quot;

B0000DCGT0|5.0|Seabiscuit surprised me! Typically, Hollywood movies are dumbed down to appeal to a mass audience; that is, too much action and not enough thought. With Seabiscuit we have plenty of action, but it is driven by the carefully thought out story line. We know Seabiscuit will most likely triumph in the end, but enough twists and turns in the plot keep us guessing about the form the final outcome will take.<br /><br />Here are three good reasons to see the film:<br /><br />1. The story: It's all about a horse, small and seemingly unfit to be more than a drudge, who is saved by a trainer who senses the great heart of a champion when he first encounters the animal. We watch the training of Seabiscuit and root for him every step of the way. Even though he upstages the three main actors in this film, they each have their own compelling story. All the plot strands come together in a satisfying conclusion which will please most viewers.<br /><br />2. The Cast: The horses are wonderful to watch. But then we have Seabiscuit's owner, Charles Howard, played capably by the reliable Jeff Bridges. Howard's is a rags to riches story. He is a good guy who lives the American dream and wins in the end. Howard's trainer is played by Chris Cooper, certainly one of the most underrated actors in the movies today. In Seabiscuit Cooper's skill, integrity, and confidence win over man and beast alike. Lastly, Tobey Maguire takes on the role of Seabiscuit's jockey, Red Pollard, who has been written off because he is too big to compete in a game where little men dominate the sport. Like Seabiscuit, Pollard is a champion with heart and he and his horse seem made for one another. Maguire seems perfect for his part. In a cameo role, William H. Macy is an eccentric radio announcer who steals the show whenever he is on camera. He is laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />3. The Scene: Much of the story takes place at or around the racetrack. We get an insiders view of a world off-limits to most of us. And the action sequences are truly compelling. How did director Ross take us right on to the track and on top of a horse as a race was being filmed? We feel like we are riding right next to Pollard and Seabiscuit as they race for the finish line. Great stuff!<br /><br />The pace of the film has been criticized by some viewers as too slow. I disagree. After all, Seabiscuit is also about the people who love the horse and believe in him and their story is an important part of the final victory against all odds. This victory of man and animal is uplifting and compelling.<br /><br />Seabiscuit is an affirmation of the American Dream. Even if its truth value seems less certain in the 21st Century, we enjoy watching it acted out at a dark time in our historyaction sequences are truly compelling.

B0000DD7NL|4.0|I am not a big Alicia Keys fan. I wasn't impressed at all with &quot;Songs in a minor&quot; there were a few good songs, but I didn't see what the big deal was. Now with her follow up album I was very pleased. I like the whole cd - there are a few tracks that she could have saved but overall it's a great cd. I even got my mom a copy as a Christmas gift. This cd should be a huge success for her.
B00005NOOH|3.0|Just got this for an early Christmas. It's good, with a lot of info on all fronts except very little on the Pacific theater. Interviews are fair, the film quality is from the 1970's because this was made in 1973. But other than that a fairly good piece of work.
068484267X|5.0|If you haven't read &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; and simply read a plot summary of it, you'll probably groan. In this book, Frank McCourt tells of his terrible Irish childhood in the 1930s and 40s, his alcoholic father, depressed mother, and the poverty he lived in. Before I read this book, I heard it described and privately thought, &quot;That's really sad, but do I really want to read another one of 'these' memoirs?&quot;<br />But &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is not remarkable for the story it tells, but for the way it is told. So many people have stories like McCourt's, only a few can tell them so well. As I read this book, I realized that while the events in it were usually horrible, McCourt didn't attempt to overdramatize them. He simply described them. And described them, I will say, with beauty. His words are filled intelligence, keen observation, and some incredible kind of humor that manages to unforgettably color the experiences and show the fighting spirit that lead McCourt out of his miserable existence. On the other hand, this understated and almost poetic writing style lends itself so well to describing the horrors of the author's life. Because of his wit, determination, and charm, displayed through his writing, we come to care deeply for the author's character, and his misfortunes impact us all the more deeply.<br />Many &quot;prize-winning&quot; books are too strange and artsy to really be appreciated; &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is just the opposite. A Pulitizer Prize winner, it will capture you with its rare beauty and astonishing power.
0316921173|5.0|David Foster Wallace's maximalist opus is as fun to read as it is daunting to start. Every chapter, footnote, and sub-footnote is grandly, weirdly, and wildly funny - they are cornucopiae filled with the energy and deliberate, second-order prescience of a comic and literary genius.<br />Of note:<br />1) Eschaton: just the rules for this aptly-named game (in the notes, of course) are as wonderful as the entire 'debacle' itself.<br />2) 'Les assassins de fauteuil roulant' - brain aneurysmically (in a good way) funny, esp. the bit wherein Orin notices the statistically improbable numbers of men in wheelchairs following him.<br />3) There is just too much more to ever hope to detail.<br />Moving on to the literary value of the work: while it is currently very trendy to knock Wallace, most criticism from outside the lit. crit. circle deals exclusively with what most consider an exclusivity in his writing; i.e., difficulty engendered by (mainly) word choice. This does not seem to be a valid criticism, as anyone who has read, say, Gaddis's &quot;A Frolic of His Own&quot; realizes that it makes &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; look like &quot;Harry Potter II: The Quickening.&quot;<br />Which is not to say that &quot;IJ&quot; can't be tough; it can. It is to say that it's much easier than one might think. And as for the lack of resolution at the end? Just read the first chapter again - trust me.<br />&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is worth it. Every single word. Other quick Amazon picks include: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez, WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes -- a glorious post-post modern romp/satire through consumerism culture, which is joyously hilarious!
B00005MNP8|4.0|The Blondie album everyone knows and adores. The punk influences are only vaguely evident here, to be replaced by some of the catchiest pop ever written, sometimes with a gloss and sheen that could make ABBA sound (almost) slightly abrasive. Despite the kitch leanings, their is enough of the gilted wit and New York swagger to keep the album in a class of its own. Deborah Harry evokes attitude to make all men want her and all women want to be her, and Clem Bourke's drumming is nothing short of awe inspiring<BR>Best Tracks: Fade Away And Radiate, Heart Of Glass, 11:59
078062999X|5.0|I have long been a fan of Shakespeare, I had classes both as a undergrad and graduate student, but I never got as much out of it as I did while watching Kenneth Branagh's adaptations of the Bard's work.  His desire to let Shakespeare's words ring out is truly magnificent and a joy to behold every time I watch them.  His adaptation of Hamlet is by far no exception, the cast, the cinematography, the incredible beauty of every scene written and played just like Shakespeare wrote them hundreds of years ago.  It's like William was there in the director's chair next to Branagh's guiding him all the way.  This full-text adaptation, for the first time, gives the viewer ALL the scene that the Bard wrote, in the order he wrote them without any substitutions or omissions, thus giving the best, most splendid view of Hamlet's world and why he acted the way he did and why others acted the way they did as well.  This is the only movie I own more than one of, I own the full screen and the widescreen version, I couldn't resist it.  Anything Shakespeare that Branagh touches turns into gold in the hands of a master.  RUN, RUN TO GET THIS MOVIE, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!
B00005MNP7|4.0|Granted, 'Eat To The Beat' is probably nudging the wrong side of overly eclectic, such a collision course of styles could portray this album as frustrating, or worse, a pretentious show off. Most people tend to view the album in this light, which is unfortunate as it offers some of the best, most rousing numbers in the Blondie catalogue. Although the tracks themselves have little to do with each other, they do prove that Blondie can master just about any musical genre they dare to delve into. And to boot, they prove on several tracks they still retain some punky grit.<BR>Best Tracks: Dreaming, Union City Blue, Atomic.
B000002IOW|5.0|First off, the cover is your first hint that this album is excellent, with its jumping rabbits and mystique. What I like about this album is its use of catchy tunes found in every song,a familiar Rush trait, but many artists have 1 or 2 duds on thier Cd's.  I have listened to every single Rush CD ever made, and their is not 1 song that is bad. Go out and buy this album, and while your at it, get every album theyve ever  made and you'll thank yourself later.Keep up the good work Rush, and I did enjoy Vapor Trails. If you get this album, you must listen to the Pass, as it is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard.
B000002U9E|5.0|Hounds Of Love is an enigma, a complex and epic masterpiece. Throughout, Bush attempts to find a balance between the difficulties of human love, life and spiritual enlightenment, and ultimately is seeking salvation. The album is divided into two sections: Side one, Hounds Of Love is rythmic, synthesised, dynamic and probably the closest Kate had come so far to sounding mainstream. Side two, The Ninth Wave, chronolises a drowning woman's dreams and her rebirth, and is complex, abstract, and perhaps occasionally weirder than anything she did on 'The Dreaming.' The album somehow manages to stay pretentious yet accessible, wildly experimental yet cohesive. A difficult feat for sure, but Bush executes this to perfection.<BR>Best Tracks: The Big Sky, Waking The Witch, Hello Earth.
020161622X|5.0|Provides a lot of what experienced developers would consider &quot;commonsense&quot; advice and philosophies. Also gives an excellent language for talking about this sort of stuff with others.<br />Short and to the point. It's sometimes hard to get &quot;I'm too busy&quot; developers to read, especially the big, dense books lots of folks like to produce around the programmer management area. It's easy to find sections in this book that are useful, can be thrown at someone and be consumed by them in a half-hour (not fully digested, though!). Absolutely wonderful.<br />What can I say? It's hard to find fault with this book. The only thing I can say that might have helped are a few stories about the risks of not following the practices, though it's questionable how much that would help things. If programmers were horses, you could lead them to water, but not until they'd suffered severe dehydration and a hospital trip or two would they convince themselves that advice you'd given around appropriate water consumption was actually useful...
B000006MS3|5.0|By far Bush's darkest AND most eccentric hour. Percussive, dense and lush, not a musical genre is left untouched as a corcucopia of weird musical instraments seam in perfectly with early Fairlight sampling technology. Bush whispers, moans, and screams throughought ten tracks that deal with personal failings and humanity's capacity for wrongdoing. What should be a very weird and unsettling album is smoothed out by immaculate production, rendering it instead an extremely quirkly yet oddly listenable experience. It seems likely that the production airbrushes somewhat over the impact the album is trying to evoke, maybe the only thing that keeps 'The Dreaming' from being a perfect article of pure genius.<BR>Best Tracks: There Goes a Tenner, Night Of The Swallow, Get Out Of My House.
B000089RVR|4.0|I love how Dido has written an album that is popular-but not bland like some top hits are. She is never afraid of bringing her album into dark places (where I think the album becomes stunningly beautiful. Ex: Do you have a little time and White Flag)her voice is like the reassuring,sublime voice of an angel in the midst of melancholy and love terribly wrong. Her songs aren't silly little jingles that are soon forgotten as the next hyped up baggy pants wearing next big THING comes along. Her songs are about life and it's wear and tear on the soul but her voice is so lovely, so angelic, it holds the promise of a brighter, better tommorow.<br />Also suggested: Eraykuh Baduh (probably spelled wrong), Heart, Stevie Nicks, Tori Amos (all are women who have incredible music and heartfelt songs.
B00000DQSS|3.0|An early indication of the genius that Kate Bush would become. The Lyrics speak with wit, ecocation, and provocation: repressed paedophilia and death from radioactive fallout are examples of the weird and varied sources Kate can seamlessly draw from. The music itself is sometimes a drawback: although it is obviously more layered and textured the experimental whims are sometimes caught in the stylistic trappings that defined her earliest work. This means that some tracks don't work as well as they should and others are just lightweight and boring. Still, there are mammoth songs here that provide far more than just cold comfort consolation.<BR>Best Tracks: Beathing, Babooshka, The Infant Kiss.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Just wanted to mention this fact, not that it is so important.
B000007MVL|3.0|Lionheart is a curious album, displaying one step forwards then two steps back in terms of Kate Bush's progression as an artist. On the plus side she's more adventurous with her writing, reaching far more diverse and interesting topics. Her attempts to expand musically, however, are undermined due to the fact that this album was rushed far too quickly, leaving potential ideas sadly a little underbaked, leaving tracks that are weakly structured and thinly executed.<BR>Best Tracks; Wow, Hammer Horror, Don't Put Your Foot On The Heartbrake
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Ok, we all know this is a visual masterpiece so let's just get to the real point. The Matrix Reloaded has it's pros and cons just like every film. The pros would be the visuals. The cons would probably be the way the story is being handled. Although this movie isn't just garbage like everyone suddenly started saying, it is flawed by unbalanced storytelling. Such as, why are they putting so much focus on Neo and Trinity and ignoring Naomi and Ghost. The Wichowski Bros. seemed to be convinced that the only fan base for the Matrix was teenagers and gamers. They didn't seem to realize the huge fan base for the serise. Having a whole storyline just pulled out and placed in a (what I consider) a pretty mediocore game is not the best idea. And what was with the lack of promotion for The Animatrix? That tied in to the story too and they treated it just like they treat every other anime with a small release. However after all this you're probably wondering why I gave this four stars instead of maybe 2. Me being the hardcore gamer/ anime fan. I had no problem following the story by watching the anime and playing the game. I just wonder how they expected this to succeed without promoting the entire story.
B000006U44|4.0|Fun, quirky and maybe just a little too twee, Kate Bush's debut is full of starry eyed romantic wonder. Given that the album doesn't get even close to the complex maturity of later albums, there are some quite humerous and even insightful observations within her lyrics here. Her music is unlike anything heard before or since: a sort of cross between modern musical theatrics and traditional folk presented with a late 70s rock vibe. Once being accustomed to the unusual stylings, there are some very catchy and infectuous offerings here.<BR>Best Tracks: Moving, Wuthering Heights, The Kick Inside.
0385504209|5.0|I loved this book.  It's fascinating and suspensful from beginning to end.  I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.  My curiosity is peaked about art as it relates to the history of the Catholic church, symbology, and specifically the mystery of the Sangreal.  What more do you want from a mystery suspense thriller?
6302891272|4.0|I am a junior at Nagoya International School who has just recently finished a term studying Macbeth in English class.  After an intense submersion in the study of Macbeth, my fellow classmates and I were able to watch Kurosawa's altered version of Macbeth--Throne of Blood.  Having carefully gone word-for-word through Shakespeare's script of Macbeth, and having watched a variety of different films of \\"Macbeth\\"--(RSC, BBC, and Polanski's versions) with the original Shakespearean dialect, I was a bit skeptical about Kurosawa's version before viewing it.  I assumed that the very different Japanese language would be a barrier to understanding and fully appreciating the complexity of Macbeth, as Shakespeare's play is wholly built on the richness of the Shakespearean language.  However, by reading along the subtitles, one realizes that the Japanese language on its own, is a very figurative language--almost poetic, and it serves as a complement to this particular production.  Also, I enjoyed the way Kurosawa substitutes the Japanese feudal hierarchy (samurai, lords, etc.) for the Scottish feudal hierarchy used by Shakespeare in Macbeth.  The portrayal of traditional Japanese props such as the \\"bukeyashiki\\" (large wooden houses) in this production's cinematography is excellent and perhaps its only close comparison would be Polanski's version of \\"Macbeth\\" as it is filmed as if in \\"Macbeth's\\" original time and place of Northern Europe.  The RSC's \\"on-stage-in-a-theater\\" version lacks spectacular technical effects (as in the BBC's motion picture) as well as color as the all the actors and actresses perform against a bleak, black fading stage dressed in black clothing.  The absense color serves to tune people's senses into the exquisiteness of the language.  In this sense, Kurosawa's \\"Throne of Blood\\" is similar to RSC's production.  It's use of black and white cinematography effectively conveys a sense of the traditional and impels people to look beyond the elegant simplicity of the Japanese interpretation.  I was very impressed with the artistic elements in \\"Throne of Blood.\\"  The traditional Japanese setting, costumes and language merge to produce a beautiful classic masterpiece. <BR>  The important themes in Shakespeare's original Macbeth are not lost in this production.  To the contrary, the cultural adaptations serve to strengthen this production as it provides a completely different atmosphere and depiction of characters, but at the same time, naturally enables the main themes of honor, gaining power, loyalty and ambition to be transmitted successfully.  The cultural interpretation of Macbeth's and Lady Macbeth's relationship is particularly interesting to note, as compared to the other Macbeth productions done in English.  In \\"Throne of Blood\\", Lady Macbeth (named Asaji) is characterized as a demanding, bossy, behind-the-walls authoritative woman.  Macbeth (Washizu) and Lady Macbeth's (Asaji) relationship is very reserved and is portrayed as if almost \\"obligatory.\\"  You cannot sense any passion between the two, but a strong sense of loyalty.  This contrasts the `hot and steamy,' affectionate relationship displayed between the two in the English versions of the Macbeth films.  Most of the twists and unexpected additions of this production are interesting supplements; however, the significant deletion of the character Macduff and the Weird Sister's warnings to Macbeth are a shame!  It is hard to imagine a Macbeth production without Macduff!  At any rate, Kurosawa manages to produce a wonderfully Japanese take on Shakespeare's Macbeth and succeeds in showing that themes dealing with human nature are universal.  These are themes we can all understand.  Kurosawa's is a very good production indeed!
037542217X|4.0|This is a book I did not want to see end, and certainly look forward to the next in the series. Smith develops the characters in this series so the reader feels a personal relationship with them. The stories are delightful, and the descriptions of life in this part of the world is wonderful. A great book, hard to put down!
0385504209|5.0|This novel was wonderful. I read it in two days and would have read it in 1 if I didn't leave all my Christmas shopping to the last minute. The mystery is hidden in codes and riddles and I LOVE that sort of thing. They enable twists and turns I never saw coming and when I think I know which direction we are going in we take a 180. And that is how excellent writing should be. I also love the delving into an ancient real-life secret society and into the history of Christianity and of the basis of our current moral code. It definitely opened my mind about some things while at the same time helped me confirm the inklings of my own intuition. There is a tremendous build-up and one may say that the novel runs out of gas (hardly), but I think it unfolds brilliantly, leaving it up to the reader to decide what the character does after the mystery is solved.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Plain and simple--this movie is awesome. The characters all struggle with the pain of addiction and it all leads to destruction in their lives. The camera shots and special effects are great. The best part about this movie is the deep plot. Many people that see it for the first time don't fully absorb the profound message and plot behind the movie. Requiem goes much deeper than people abusing drugs, it shows how dependent people can become on objects that give them gratification and it shows how far people will go to accomplish their goals. It really takes you info the lives of the characters and puts you in their shoes. I would highly suggest that everyone see this movie at least once... it is truly one of a kind and powerful.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Its been quite awhile since Tarantino gave us something to talk about and now I can't stop talking about this movie. It truly exceeded my expectations and surpassed anything he has given us so far. With all the movies filled with martial arts violence already in existence I expected the usual, but Tarantino's synism and brutal wit threw the ordinary out the window.<BR>I was on the edge of my seat with a big grin watching Kill Bill. I loved how Uma's yellow outfit was the same as Bruce Lee's in 'Game of Death'. The plot was all it needed to be, revenge, it speaks for itself. I left the theater with the tingle. Lately that has only happened after the matrix movies.<br />this is probably one of the funniest and most fun movies I've seen in a long time
B0000DJZA0|4.0|This CD/DVD bundle works well in many ways: it is a nice compilation (though not comprehensive, containing ALL the band's hits, but which compilation does this, for God's sake?!) of Coldplay's two albums so far. In doing so, the music album serves as a great intro item for those that are new to their work, one that touches on Radiohead, Travis, U2, and a host of other influences (and similar sounds), yet retaining a very particular identity that makes Coldplay unmistakeable.<br />On the flip side, &quot;longtime&quot; fans of the band are up for a nice couple of treats: live versions of their best songs, most of which work very well in concert and remind me more of their likeness to U2, than their similarities with Radiohead that come out so strong in the studio. In addition to this, there's the concert DVD, which conveys all their live energy and, when combined with the CD, makes a very good deal!<br />I guess the only &quot;negative&quot; thing I see about this bundle is the smell of record label claws all over it. Considering the short span of the band's life, such an offering after only two studio albums (as successful as they've both been) can only mean one thing: greed. I can only hope that this is the label's greed and not the band's, because one the best things about them has been their simplicity all the way, having been taken by surprise by world acclaim.
B0000C1733|5.0|Wow; what can I say? Only a few bands out today can say that they are musically relevant after 10 years, let alone 20?! The Chili Peppers went from wild child heroin junkies to rock elder statesmen, and we've been there for the entire ride. 75% of the bands cluttering up the rock scene these days owe their careers to these guys(Korn, Limp Bizkit, 311, No Doubt, Incubus,etc), though I doubt the guys would claim most of them. Anthony Keidis was rhyming over rock riffs long before it became fashionable and trendy, and still do it better than most. And speaking of riffs, Flea is a KICK ASS bass player;enough said. He has got to be put up ther with the likes of Cliff Burton, Geezer Butler, Krist Novoselic and John Paul Jones among the low axe men greats. Perhaps this should have been titled Greatest Hits: For Now, since their careers are FAR from over. Thank you for all the great music over the years, guys.
B00002E224|5.0|After watching this movie I felt a little hole in my heart... maybe it opened my memory to all those moments in my life as short or shorter than Jesse and Celine's 18 hour encounter that had the same deep impact in my life than their night together in Viena had on theirs. Some nostalgia and sadness but also great joy is what it generated on me. <BR>This is a story about assimilating that life can only be lived once (it's no old lady memories, there are no dress rehearsals) and therefore open our arms to the unexpected, to those moments where we may truly connect with other beings and be able to share intimate thoughts making us feel completed, plenty, not only a scattered fraction of a soul. It seems difficult but sometimes we just have to slow the pace to see those opportunities and don't fail to embrace them... to be able afterwards to let them go without regretting anything.<BR>The director is very clever leaving the end of the movie open to our thoughts and I will always be grateful to him for having let this two unforgettable characters (great performances) meet, be touched by one another and in so many ways recovered their faith in the existence of treasure moments in life even if they are sporadic; those moments that make everything else worth it... moments as magical and cruel as real life itself.
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD is the greatest collection of songs I've heard in a very long time. (And I've been around for a while ;-) ) From the swooping melody of &quot;Clocks&quot; to the Oasis-esque &quot;A Whisper&quot;, this CD will truly touch you.  Every song is catchy and has its own unique feel.  If you're searching for a quality band in this time of often times not-so-quality music, look no further than Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This is one of my favorate movies. I have watched it  at least 10 times. My favorate two secnes are When the photon torpedoes tore a huge hole through the view screen, and when the Enterprise and Schmitar collided, it was just amazing.I know this sounds tacky, but in the end when Data rescues Capten Picard, and then was killed, I nearly cried.The dvd also has a really cool interactive menu and has great audio and visual effects. Please buy it. Thanks for reading.
B00006LLNU|5.0|If they did not exist we would have to invent them.
0767802519|1.0|I have watched both this 110 minute version and the 132 minute version and found that this shorter version tells a very different tale from the 132 minute version. What is worse is that the shorter version not only skips various angles of Leon's and Mathilda's relationship but also makes the action sequences feel dumb having lost out on _several_ moments of suspense. If you really want the suspense, buy the uncut edition.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Please people... stop trying to convince yourself that this is a good album and worth the hard earned dough you paid for it. Now i have nothing against Radiohead, i loved Ok computer too, but more than half of this electro-dreck should never have made the final cut. Unless you're all really masochists i recommend you get &quot;Antenna&quot; by Cave in instead.
B000099T2L|1.0|Beyonce may have shown a masterful touch crafting herself into an entertainment and endorsement brand unto herself, but she clearly lacks the fundamental talent to back it up, the substance underneath the stylish packaging.  Radio hits &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; illustrate just how poor a vocalist she is without a talented producer, and the videos for these songs show her up as a far less talented dancer than her counterparts Britney, Christina, and Mya.
B000000WA4|3.0|Why are Smashing Pumpkins fans unable to have an objective opinion. It seems like every little insignificant noise Corgan and co puts onto cd is hailed as genius. The same applies to Radiohead, Pearl jam and Tool. Now i have nothing against these bands, particularly the Pumpkins who created some of the finest Alternative rock of the 90s. But seriously with nearly 30 tracks this album is about 85% fools gold. I don't think i've ever had to use the skip button as much as i did on this album. You feel me?
B0000C6E4D|4.0|No, it is not as stunningly beautiful as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy which is Sarah's greatest crowning achievement, but it is still Sarah's voice and thus it is still beautiful.  It took awhile for these songs to grow on me, but they have.  Yes, some lyrics are trite as others have said--but maybe that's what motherhood has done to her, make her more, I don't know, &quot;schmoopy&quot;!  It's still Sarah and still beautiful as always.
B0000CNY27|3.0|\\"Snake, what are you doing?\\" \\"I'm playing with myself.\\" Is one of the classic lines from this John Carpenter classic. Arguably Carpenters best film outside of Halloween, Escape from New York is a great dark futuristic movie about a time when crime is so bad the government turned all of Staten Island into a prison with no gaurds and no order, the convicts are left to fend for themselves. Kurt Russel plays Snake Plisken, a cool, bad a**  convicted felon who is hired by the government to go into the prison to rescue the president who's been held hostage by the inmates. They put a device in his neck that will blow his head off if he tries to escape or fails his mission. He is dropped into the ultimate bad neighborhood run by the hardest, most dangerous, vile and ha-nus criminals imaginable and the clock is ticking. <br />This is a fun and exciting movie and is one of the all time classic 80's sci fi movies. Its about time a special edition of this film has been made, the previous dvd release only had a trailer on it. This is much, much better.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|He escuchado a mùsicos cristianos con gran talento: Michael O'Martian, Michael W. Smith y Newsboys son un claro ejemplo de lo que estoy hablando. En el caso de Neil Morse, se daban trazos de que el Señor tenìa un poderoso llamado para èl. Basta escuchar el albùm V de Spock's Beard, &quot;At the end of the day&quot;, su maravillosa lìrica, para entrever que Dios estaba obrando poderosamente en su corazòn.... Comprè este CD por pura casualidad y, crèame, hacìa tiempo que no escuchaba un trabajo conceptual tan completo como TESTIMONY. Neil Morse logra expresar con su mùsica de que se trata un encuentro con un Cristo real, capaz de llenar todos aquellos huecos que el mundo y los placeres son incapaces de hacerlo....sencillamente impresionante..... <br />Los arreglos musicales son extraordinarios. La calidad de los mùsicos es incuestionable. Basta señalar que en la bateria està nada menos que Mike Portnoy (Dreamtheater, Liquid Tension, Trasatlantic) y un veterano de la sensibilidad como lo es el exviolinista de Kansas, Kerry Livgren. Probalemente, es el mejor diaco que he escuchado en el 2003, superando en su estilo y sensibilidad a Karnataca, que ya es decir....Definitivamente, en las manos de Jesucristo se hace mejor......<br />There are cristians artists that had make history in modern music: Michael O'Martian, Michael W. Smith and Newsboys, for example. If you hear carefully Spock's Beard &quot;V&quot;, &quot;At the end of the day&quot; probably you can suspect that the Lord Jesus was dealing heavily with Morse heart. I get this CD by pure luck and believe me, it was a long time that I have heard a musical work so beautiful and powerful as conceptual musical work call TESTIMONY. Morse simply express what happens when you have a true encounter with the Kings of Kings....nothing compares to be at the living presence of the Living and True Lord of Live....<br />Musical arrangements are fantastic. The combination of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, drum master Portnoy (Dreamtheater, Liquid Tension, Trasatlantic) and the great violin of Livgren (Kansas)gives power musical additives to the music. This is probably the best album that I have heard in 2003, even better that Karnataca works....When you are in the hands of the Lord, everything goes better and better....
B00005Y7L4|4.0|How do you combat growing juvenille delinquency in a society with a bleak future, double-digit unemployment, and a loss of belief in the traditional codes of honor?  Why, you gather up a random class of 7th graders and send them off to a deserted island to survive...<br />... only the dangers present aren't akin to eating bugs or getting voted off the show.  No, each student is equipped with a duffel bag with some sort of &quot;weapon&quot; and a explosive-filled collar set to go off after three days unless the mission is accomplished: the death of all but one of the students.<br />Petty differences and puppy loves are suddenly amplified into matters of life and death as students either bond together in the hopeless struggle to survive or turn predator and exercise their worst grudges on their former friends and classmates.  The film is a kind of Lord of the Flies taken to logical extremes, and the carnage that ensues is enough to disturb even a hardened action and horror film fan like myself.<br />The film is worth a watch and definitely carries a message; the extreme violence in its own perverse way is a statement against killing.  I enjoyed this film at a late-nite Japanese film festival, and I think many of you will like it as well if you give it a chance.
B000002PH1|5.0|I love this album! Sure, it's as commercial as pop music gets, but you can't deny the passion heard in Belinda's gorgeous voice. Too bad the bands peddling faux-agnst like Nirvana had to strain their larynxes to make poor attempts at convincing listeners they had passion, because Belinda is as honest as they wished they were. Well-informed music fans all know that Cobain was jealous Belinda was in The Germs with Pat Smear, so he wanted to try to be punk by signing Pat on and using his name credibility. Anyway... Each song on Heaven on Earth is good enough to have been a single. I know many people say that about many of artists' albums, but it truly is the case with this CD. I'm sure nearly everyone's familiar her love anthem Heaven is a Place on Earth, even though they might not recognize Belinda Carlisle. Sadly, we've barely heard from her since 1990. For a huge Belinda fan like me, that's a shame because Live Your Life Be Free is just as good as her first three solo albums, and nobody even acknowledged the album. It was much better than the equally-commercial grunge pop that began to spawn around the time. She released two more studio albums (Real &amp; A Man and a Woman, neither of which moving at all). Belinda has since fizzled out of the public's consciousness, but she'll always have a place in my heart for the beautiful first four studio albums which include Heaven on Earth.
B000067CPX|1.0|I can't even give this album 2 stars as much as I love the Chili Peppers. They have lost their hard-rock\punk\funk inspired edge. I know they are older now and need to change musically but I can't seem to know how anyone can enjoy listening to some of this material. It makes garage bands look good. Californication was pretty mellow but this album is a real sleeper. The new mellow Peppers are not for me.
B00008EYA5|3.0|\\"S.W.A.T\\" falls into those categories where the film formula works but there's nothing special about it. Give it due, the film has good suspense, thrills and a nice cast to boot. But there's nothing new or original about this film. I was expecting some surprises and perhaps a better plotline for this movie, and there isn't. <br />This cop film based on the successful 1970's TV series has Samuel L. Jackson( a brilliant character actor)a retired police sergeant, giving greenlight to organize a special tactics team for LAPD. The team is a talented group filled with crop crowd like Colin Farrell and LL Cool J. They get the job done, and when a international terrorist is arrested in LA, the criminal offers \\"$100 million dollarssss!\\" to anyone who will break him out of custody. Soon every lowlife in the city wants the piece of the action, and the SWAT team escorting him to prison now have their jobs pushing to the limit.<br />I'm sure any action junkie will defenitly will reccomend this film. I'm a action fan, but I look at facts. I look at logic, and maybe a few key thinking now and then. This film lacks originality and is quite predictable. I mean, I know the heroes will save the day by the end, but maybe something different will occur at the climax? <br />SWAT is satisfying in ways. It lives up to the series, but not that much.
0385504209|5.0|Being a Christian and a student of science, both this book and Angels&amp;Demons were extremely captivating to me.  Even setting the subject aside, the storyline/plot alone was incredibly attention-grabbing.<br />  Although i loved both books, i read this one faster than Angels&amp;Demons. But i'm not sure if it was because this is a tiny bit more suspenseful or because I read this one first, and the novelty of Dan Brown's writing and style caused me to not be able to put it down. However Angels&amp;Demons' story line was a bit more complex than the Da Vinci Code, and less predictable too.  I had my suspicions of who the culprit was in this book but when the culprit was revealed in Angels&amp;Demons, it hit me like a ton of bricks.<br />  Some people might be annoyed with the author's attention to details, namely, facts of history and art. I never enjoyed history in school, or any other liberal arts subject matters, but I feel his explanations and details necessary and served as the backbone of the storyline. These two fiction novels were surprisingly educational and I was glad to have learned so much after each reading. Part of what makes these books so great is that they contains so many facts the average person wouldn't know, and these ground the stories and prevented me from thinking that the events happening were too outrageous / unbelievable. Don't start these books if you can't afford to lose sleep /put off whatever you were supposed to do for a couple of hrs.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|I ordiarily love Ms Houston and just knew this would be a good one. Boy was I ever wrong. I honestly think this whole album was recorded in a Gas Station bath room, while gargling Listerine.
0812550706|5.0|You're probably sick of how many people rave about this book, but there's a good reason for that! it's hard to put into this words why it's so amazing. if you're interested at all in science, space, the future, war, aliens, human nature and conditioning, child psychology, friendship... you'll be captivated this book.  I can name 15-20 friends/acquaintences who have read it (most, in one sitting), loved it, and recommended it to others.  i've seen copies of the book that are so ancient and tattered from people re-reading it repeated over the years and from it being lent to friends.  Even people who never read books for pleasure, and were &quot;forced&quot; to read it by their friends' insistence, only had good things to say.  I don't want to give any part of the storyline away, just read it yourself, it's the only way you'll understand.<BR>  Those who loved it can look forward to reading the entire Ender's series (Speaker of the Dead, Xenocide, and lastly, Children of the Mind) and be comforted that it's not over yet.  But I recommend picking up Ender's Shadow before proceeding to Speaker (in continuation of Ender's life) because it parallels Ender's Game; it focuses on his friend's life and goes over what happened in Ender's Game, but from the friend's perspective - which is an incredibly novel idea, but don't worry, Ender's Shadow is equally suspenseful and exciting if you can believe it.  After that, Shadow Puppets to find out what happens to the rest of Ender's friends, before you forget them.

0156012197|4.0|You can read it to a child, but this is definitely not a children's book; you can have a long discussion about it with fellow adult friends. There are so many deeper meanings and inferences behind everything. It gets you thinking, the simultaneous simplicity and complexicity of the book stays with you; after finishing you might think it a bit haunting.<br />  Easily read in one sitting, it captivates you because you have so many questions in your head and you just have to know what happens next.  The author's 1-page biography is also captivating, and only makes the story more meaningful.
0393307050|2.0|I've never read a book where the author tried so hard to keep all the dialog and terms true to period. I rarely understood what was going on; it was English, but from times past (the King James Bible is easier reading). That, plus all the nautical jargon that is never explained, kept me from any enjoyment the book may have had to offer. I gave up after a third of the book.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Overrated?  Probably the funniest part of agitated's review is the end...&quot;In 50 years time, everyone will be talking about Simon LeBon and Nick Rhodes while Jimmy Page and Robert Plant will be long forgotten. Mark my words.&quot;  Sorry agitated, most people have already forgotten about Simon LeBon and Nick Rhodes...and in 50 years only senior citizens will have any idea who they are.  Led Zeppelin will continue to attract new, young fans then, just as they do now.<br />For any true music fan, this set is a must-have.  Absolutely fantastic...
B000060P79|1.0|There seems to be plenty of negative feedback on this CD, so much so that you don't need me to write another bad review. Too bad, here goes. If you like Simple Plan cuz you're 12 years old and having a lot of problems and can relate to their POP music, then go ahead, keep these poor canucks on our airwaves by buying their cd. If you like Simple Plan for their meaningful lyrics and punk style, well then, don't buy this cd. Listen to Thrice or AFI. And realize how lame this stuff really is.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Could have been a lot better, the flick led us one way, then delivered in another.  Way too predictable, went from entertaining to insultingly dumb.  Give it a look, but not for your collection.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After seeing &quot;Wicked&quot; shortly after it opened, I waited breathlessly for the soundtrack to be released.  &quot;Wicked&quot; was truly a fun, exciting show that leaves you humming the tunes long after you've left the theater.  My feeling is that while Kristen Chenoweth is excellent, Idina Menzel should have received top billing.  She completely stole the show -- I will be looking out for her work from this point forward.  The strength and conviction in her singing is fantastic.  I would enjoy this soundtrack whether or not I'd seen the show, simply because the music is so energizing and catchy.  If you love energizing showtunes, you'll love &quot;Wicked&quot;!
B0000028M7|5.0|My favorite CD.<BR>Them Bones- Hard rockin' song with driving tempo. Jerry Cantrell does a really cool solo. A excellent opener for a great album.<BR>Dam That River- Kinda the same feeling as Them Bones, but nonetheless it's really well put together by Jerry Cantrell, cool basslines by Mike Starr, and the drumming is frickin'sick.<BR>Rain When I Die- One of the most unde       songs by AIC, along with Got Me Wrong. I think it's the most well thought out songs of the album, (it was written by all four).<BR>Down in a Hole- The greatest song ever. The song that got me listening. It's probably the most reckognized AIC song. Very depressing and beautifully lined with self-hate.<BR>Sickman- This is just a cool song, the drumming at the beginning is awesome, the guitar part is really hard and matches the drumming. The lovely screaming by Layne Staley is a nice touch.<BR>Rooster- The other greatest song ever. It's about Jerry's dad in the 'Nam war. the lyrics are wonderful and they fit the mood. Cantrell, once again, provides some of the simplest yet coolest guitar parts ever, what with his wah pedal and everything.<BR>Junkhead- Another cool song, not beautiful like Rooster or anything. depressing, loud,     ful. Just what you'd expect from AIC.<BR>Dirt-Ditto, but more beautiful. the solo is awesome.<BR>Godsmack- Where do you think the band Godsmack got their name? This is a cool song not unlike Sickman.<BR>Hate to Feel- Not well-recognized but one of my favorites. it's one of Staley's best.<BR>Angry Chair- Yet another coolest song in the world. and the other most recognized song. it was one that almost got me listening. Written by Staley, cool Cantrell solo.<BR>Would?- Another AIC hit, the bass intro is really cool. the verse is very dark and foreboding. the chorus is awesome. the ending is cool, kinda like the chorus.
B000062XM7|5.0|Having read some of the reviews of the director's cut DVD, I'm glad I've only seen the original theatrical version of the movie which is the same as the VHS. I was equally blessed to get a widescreen version on VHS which preserves the wonderful cinematography of the film with its breathtaking scenery of North Carolina. The Last of the Mohicans is a beautiful story and it is translated well into film by director Michael Mann. Why he decided to revisit this well-received effort and brutalize it in a &quot;director's cut&quot; is beyond me. Maybe he thought he could make a few more bucks from a special edition?<BR>That aside, this is a movie that will please both men and women who love the thrill of high adventure and romance. Daniel Day-Lewis is perfectly cast as the novel's Hawkeye, the adopted white son of a Mohican and the bridge between that dying Indian culture and the European settlers of the new world. Together with his father Chingachgook (Russell Means) and brother Uncus (Eric Schweig), Hawkeye lives as a hunter and wanderer with some familiarity and friendship with the scattered British settlers on the western frontier of the colonies.<BR>The beautiful Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and her sister Alice (Jodhi May) enter the story as daughters of a British colonel in command of Fort William Henry. They are escorted to visit their father by a young British officer and squad of soldiers but are betrayed by their Indian scout Magua (Wes Studi), who it turns out had revenge on his mind all along. I was glad they actually explained Magua's motivations later in the plot. Just as the company of Brits is being slaughtered by Hurons, Hawkwye and his companions intervene and save the women and the officer. They persuade Hawkeye to take them to the fort. Despite Cora's horror at Hawkeye's necessary violence and seeming lack of compassion, there is instant chemistry between these two characters which is only really played out later.<BR>Of the travails this band of travelers endures over the course of the plot, the highlight must surely be the final battle on the clifftop recognized by the Amazon reviewer and I'm sure many others who love this movie. The tense buildup, the longing for things to turn out well, the unspoken love (between Alice and Uncus), and even the brutality all tug at your heart and bring tears to your eyes. The haunting music is an integral part of carrying the emotion of this scene. It's one of my all-time favorite scenes in movies.<BR>This film was interesting in providing a little history of the Anglo-French war over the colonies and the way the Indian tribes allied themselves, but its greater value lies in telling a tale of chivalry, bravery, passion and sacrifice. I hope everyone gets a chance to see it.
B000002L80|5.0|I want to defend this album. In contrast to many of the other reviewers, I beleive that this album marked a positive turning point. I don't dance, so I don't like dance music. I'm not an artist, so I really don't appreciate \\"quirky\\" and avant garde. I guess some would call me a \\"casual music\\" lover. I love the melody, hooks, energy, and lyrics on this album. I loved Talking Heads' first two albums, but then they lost me until this release. Little Creatures marks a change in direction for Byrne that continued, while evolving, into his solo albums. This release, True Stories, and all of Byrne's solo releases are among my favorite albums in my collection. If you prefer John Lenon over Parliament, I believe you'll prefer this album over Remain In Light.
6304211740|5.0|I have been a Jane Eyre fan since high school and have seen almost all of the different movie versions. This one is my favorite.  Why?  Most importantly, this is the only Jane Eyre film with a \\"plain Jane.\\"  Her unattractiveness is absolutely fundamental to the story.  The other cinematic Janes, Joan Fontaine and Suzanna York are drop dead gorgeous, Samantha Morton is very pretty and Zelah Clark is cute, chubby and perky, nothing like the \\"real\\" Jane Eyre of the book.  When this book was published in 1847, it was absolutely unheard of to have a plain heroine, but Charlotte Bronte felt strongly about her heroine's plain looks and the book became a phenomenal best-seller in its day.  Despite plain-Jane's best-seller status, most 20-century film adaptations still can't handle the idea of a plain heroine.  Well, this film can and did!<br />(Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance has been criticized in other Amazon reviews as being less than passioned.  But by the time Jane meets Rochester, her natural passion had been repressed, both by her lengthy austere circumstances and her own strong will.  Her passion therefore, for most of the story is internal.  Charlotte Gainsbourg does a fine job of portraying a Jane Eyre whose turbulent emotions are hidden below a firmly self-controlled surface.)<br />Secondly, the age difference between Rochester and Jane is fully realized in this film.  They are supposed to be 20 years apart.  All the other Jane/Rochester's look like they are approximately the same age, while William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg don't even look like they belong together -- exactly the point of the story.<br /><br />Thirdly, there are a few little scenes and lines straight out of the book that I haven't seen in any other adaptations but this one.  For instance, there is a small but key moment in the book -- Rochester smoking a cigar in the garden just before he declares his love for Jane.  In the book, she smells his cigar and tries to escape before he notices her.  To have William Hurt puffing on a cigar at this point in the film is a nice true-to-the-book touch.  There are many other such incidents and lines in this film that I haven't seen in any other versions and haven't had the pleasure of meeting since I read the book.<br />Of course, given the time limit of this movie, there is some unavoidable tinkering with the plot line.  If you want more of the actual text and plot, get the Timothy Dalton version, but try to keep William Hurt in mind while you watch it. Yes, I know -- he's blond, but he gives an excellent performance.  His good looks are toned down and he manages to be the most compelling Rochester I have yet to see on film.  Timothy Dalton is tolerable in his portrayal but too thin, handsome, and too high strung; his acting is difficult to watch at times. Hurt's portrayal is also far superior to the one actor who has the closest physical resemblence to Rochester -- Orson Welles, whose performance is a string of ridiculous screaming fits.  Watching Cirian Hinds' portrayal is like getting too near a snake pit or a steaming pot of boiling oil; he's way too tortured and it's not a pleasant sight.  Yes, Rochester was a tortured man, but he usually kept it in check and below the surface.  The nuances of this complicated character are lost on most all of the the actors that have attempted to play Rochester; all of the actors that is, except William Hurt who brings to his performance all the irony and subtlty the others are sorely lacking.<br />William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg are as cinematically close as you will get to the physicality of this famous couple of literature.  Although the superiority of this film can be measured by the plainness of it's leading characters, I must conclude by saying that it is beautifully shot and includes a gorgeous soundtrack.r.

B0000CNY27|4.0|Escape from your wallet? Well thats exactly what your cash should be doing right now! It's taken so long for die hard fans to finaly get to see the Bank Robbery sequence that is included on this disc. I already owned the first DVD release of this title and when you compare the two together the transfer is so much better and the sound is great. There is a comic included which is roughly the same size as the one included in the special edition of spider man. If you have also played the first Metal Gear Solid on the PS one you will notice that the start of the first game has the same elevator squence has the bank robbery. This film deserves all the attention it gets.Get it Snake Bites!
B000063DI9|5.0|1988, after 1986's somewhat experimental 'Somewhere In Time', Iron Maiden ventures further into their progressivness and churns out another great album.  While it may not be as good as classics such as 'Number of the Beast' or 'Somewhere In Time', it is still a great album and probably equals 'Powerslave' in my book.  It is also Iron Maiden's most aggressive sounding album, as well. The album overall is just a progressive masterpiece.  <br />1. Moonchild: Starting from the acoustic passage to start the song, to the completely awesome riff right after that, this is definitely a great song.  Bruce's singing, while somewhat different is the highlight here.  Some great progressive riffs also highlight the song.<BR>Rating: A-<br />2. Infinite Dreams: Quite possibly the best song on the album, with the soft part, slow part, and midtempo part.  The soft intro has a great guitar part with an bassline under it, and once again Bruce's vocals are great.  Not to be missed.<BR>Rating: A<br />3. Can I Play With Madness: Definitely the most overrated song on the album, this is an all out 80's pop-metal song.  Luckily, Bruce pulls of some good vocals to make up for the commercial-ness of the song.<BR>Rating: C<br />4. The Evil That Men Do: One of the best songs on the album, with some awesome riffs, good bass, and once again, great vocals.  The solo done by Adrian Smith is one of the easiest solos in an Iron Maiden song, yet is awesome as well.<BR>Rating: A<br />5. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son: Here in this nearly 10 minute epic, Maiden pulls off some of their best soloing ever.  The intro is great, all I wish it had was maybe more to it (kinda odd to say for this song).  And the instrumental finish to the song is absolutely amazing.  It needs to be heard to be believed.<BR>Rating: A<br />6. The Prophecy: One of the weaker songs on the album, yet isn't quite a filler.  It does have a good intro, but the rest of the song seems somewhat generic.  Not bad, though.<BR>Rating: B<br />7.The Clairvoyant: Starting with the great bass intro from Steve Harris to the riffs in between the vocals, this song is just a progressive awesome song, being the most progressive on the album.  An all around good song.<BR>Rating: A-<br />8. Only the Good Die Young: No, not the Billy Joel song.  The last song on one of the great Iron Maiden albums, with Iron Maiden not quite album to put out anything great until 2000's 'Brave New World'.  Overall, this is a good song, with a somewhat malevolent feeling to part of the verse, and a good chorus as well.<BR>Rating: A-<br />I'd definitely reccomend this to anyone who enjoyed Somewhere In Time.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If you begin to listen to the CD just because you want to put it down and you hate britney, you obviously won't like it. If you wanna listen to some good music, there's no way you can't like this CD. I loved all the songs except probably Early morning. This CD is great but I was still a bit disappointed with the number of ballads. <BR>And to whoever said that 'in the zone' is a crap title, do you even know what context its refferred to here?? Britney keeps explaining in all her interviews so that people like you understand. 'Zone' is this creative mood people get into where nothing can stop them and they can do what they're best at with that creativity you get once in a while. <BR>Sorry to sound rude but I hate people who put down other successful people because they can't do anything themselves.<BR>I'd give all the songs 10 on 10, toxic 11/10 ans everytime 15/10.<BR>The lyrics are ok and pathetic like those max martin songs. <BR>I'd say it is worth every penny you spend on it.
B000063DHL|5.0|Following 4 absolutely beautiful albums put up by Iron Maiden from 1982 to 1985, how could they possibly follow it up (and also Powerslave) with their next album?  Well Iron Maiden decided to experiment a little, and with synths as well.  The first single, Wasted Years was definitely quite a commercial 80s song, so is this a commercial sell out?  Definitely not at all.<br />1. Caught Somewhere In Time: Best song on the album, and absolutely amazing with the brilliant instrumental intro, one of the best ever.  Bruce Dickinson's singing is great, controlled at times, and the air-raid siren we all know of at times.  Great solos done by Adrian Smith and Dave Murray as well, and some thunderous bass by Steve Harris.<BR>Rating: A+<br />2. Wasted Years: By far the most commercial song on the album, but isn't a bad one with the awesome intro and great solo by Adrian Smith.  The rest of the song is somewhat standard.<BR>Rating: B<br />3. Sea of Madness: Another awesome song, and probably the heaviest song on the album as well.  Has a great intro riff and verse riff, and Bruce's singing is absolutely superb on this song, going from normal (verse), to mysterious (pre-chorus), to melodic (chorus).  Great song, not to be missed.<BR>Rating: A<br />4. Heaven Can Wait: Another classic off the album, with an awesome intro, but the best part of the song has got to be the somewhat instrumental middle part, with all the (ooh's).  A great riff behind it, and later some great lead guitar work.  So awesome...<BR>Rating: B+<br />5. Loneliness of the Long Distance: Sadly, Iron Maiden once again could not keep a filler out of their album.  But don't go skipping this song already, its a good.  Good riffs and a fast paced song mark this one, but the lyrics (not the singing) are downright terrible.  I'd reccomend for a first listen, listen to it without the lyrics.<BR>Rating: B<br />6. Stranger In A Strange Land: A melodic Maiden classic.  Absolutely brilliance on the verse.  Pure &quot;awesomeness&quot;.<br />Rating: A-<br />7. Deja Vu: Another filler, but a great song!  The lyrics aren't too deep, but the singing (the effect at least) is awesome, and makes the song sound kinda eerie.  Good riffs, but my one complaint is the main riff seems kinda, simple.  Good chorus, as well.<BR>Rating: A-<br />8. Alexander the Great: Obviously another attempt at a &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, but it definitely fails.  One reviewer said that it sounded like Bruce was reading out of a history book, and he's right.  Try going without knowing the lyrics for the first listen.  Good chorus and some nice riffs as well.<BR>Rating: B<br />Yea, just go get this album, its worth it.
B00005JMGC|3.0|The 1950s. The decade best known for its classic style, revolutionary music, major political events, and the rebirth of American society after a devastating war. Now, in 2003, it is also the setting for one of the most promising fall movies of the year, \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\", which although moderately satisfying, fall short of greatness.<br />This film, which also drew much attention as it symbolized Julia Robert's comeback after a year of seclusion, follows the story of UC Berkely graduate Katherine Watson (Roberts) who takes up a position as an art history teacher at the prestigious Wellesly College. As an all-girls school, the main conflict in the movie stems from the students torn between the more repressive morals and molds of 1950s women and their wishes for a more respectful, intellectual existence. As well as the conflict within the student body, Katherine finds herself immersed in controversy as well, as her curriculum and methods of teaching in the beginning are not respected by the faculty or the students she teaches. Among them, a harsh headmistress (Marian Seldes) and a scathing student with a dark secret (Kirsten Dunst) who critizes her every move. <br />However, as much predicted, Katherine wins over the students and parts of the faculty, but it is the way in which the film comes to a close that is rather unsettling. Characters that were well-established in the first hour of the film begin to lose their signature beliefs or attitudes towards different characters that were so strongly stressed, and plotlines are left without explanation, which leaves the audience with many unanswered questions. Not only that, but the story ends predictably, and not to mention abruptly, with little inclination as to how it got there. It's easy to tell the ideals and motives that the film is trying to stress, and it sets out with an ambitious idea on how to show them to the viewers, but it can't quite articulate the ideas in a meaningful fashion so that it touches the audience.        <br />With a slew of brilliant young actresses (such as the wonderful Kirsten Dunst, newcomer Ginnifer Goodwin, and my personal favorite in the film, Maggie Gyllenhaal), with mostly solid performances (with the exception of Julia Stiles, who was suprisingly bland in her role as Joan) and a wonderful idea for a film, it's quite a mystery to me how \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" doesn't quite satisfy us as the audience as much as we would like it to. It could possibly be the direction of Mike Newell, although much more likely the writing team of Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (who collaborated on \\"Planet of the Apes\\", among others), who although presenting us with a handful of feel-good moments, shocking turn-arounds, and emotional scenes in the script, try too hard to close up the story with a happy ending, which in turn, leaves many of the important plotlines and conclusions to the original motives off the radar. In short, \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is definitely one of the feel-good movies of the fall, but don't expect it to generate any Oscar buzz.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I have not yet been so fortunate as to have seen Wicked on the Broadway Stage, but still I waited in anticipation for the release of the CD, if only to hear the marvelous and mellifluous sounds which eminate from star Kristen Chenoweth.  When I purchased the CD on its release date, I was pleasantly surprised to find more to enjoy.<br />Wicked, the original cast album, is simply fun.<br />I have read reviews of the show and the CD, and while its stars have been nearly universally exalted for their performances, the score has met with less enthusiasm across the board.   While the score at first listen did not blow me away, I must, as with all cast albums, listen more than once, and attempt to apply the context to the songs as they fit into the greater piece of work.  The liner notes did not include a synopsis, so i was forced to listen more closely to each song, and I must say, this score becomes more enjoyable with repeat listening.<br />I am a musician, but certainly not on a Broadway standard, and I would say that this score, while not as musically intricate as some, is quite aesthetically pleasing.   From the simple yet pristine harmonizing of the two leads in &quot;What is This Feeling&quot;, to the hysterical hook of &quot;Popular&quot;, this score is just fun.<br />In reading the lyrics, I did not find any groundbreaking rhyming schemes or rhythmic patterns, but I found songs that were pleasing to my ear,which told a clear story without being TOO literal, and delivered by exquisite voices.  <br />Upon repeat listening, more songs stood out: Dancing Through Life actually makes a statement, not in a pretentiously &quot;deep, complex&quot; manner, but rather simply.  (It's also got a good beat and you can dance to it.  Ha ha)  Defying Gravity is a vocal tour de force, and I imagine that live, it would render me a blob of protoplasm in my theater seat.  I'm Not That Girl already moistens my eyes, and not in a cheap &quot;feel sorry for me&quot; fake pathos-way, butwith genuine delivery.<br />Everyone sees and hears things through their own different personal filter.   I certainly recommend this CD to the musical theater fan, and to the non-fan as well.  I would also recommend that it be listened to in a straight-forward manner, not with overly erudite expectations.  I would encourage listeners to do so without irony, as the lyrics provide all that's necessary. <br />I hope others will enjoy as much as I have, and that their pleasure increases upon repeat listening.
B00008RWRH|5.0|I love this set so much I sold my Davis Duo sets to the used shop. This is a must buy for any Haydn fan.
B000002H70|5.0|This album definately ranks as one of my top five most favorite albums.  I've a rather eclectic taste- albums in this goth and proto-goth genre only make up 10% or less of the albums I own.  This is the perfect winter album, raining album, or somber mood album. The transition between when &quot;Same Deep Water as You&quot; ends and when &quot;Disintegration&quot; starts is very much the closest thing I come to an orgasm or endorphin release- the build up is so perfect and the pay-off primed that it never fails to hit me with an immense power when I'm listening to the whole album from start to finish. This is one I never listen to just a song or two, though there are some songs that made it as single-song hits, this album occupies a much more important place in my mind.
0345350499|5.0|I believe this is the best book Bradley has ever written--or is ever likely to write. It is absolutely inspired with the kind of writer's magic that only comes from writing from the heart. A story like this cannot be coaxed from the head alone. The interweaving of the characters, the struggle between old beliefs and new, the historic timeline all dovetail beautifully to create a tapestry of myth, magic and emotion. I wish I had written this book!
6302891272|4.0|My name is Towa and I am a student at Nagoya International School. I read Macbeth for English class and saw the movie Throne of Blood afterwards. This Kurosawa version of Macbeth was a powerful piece. Although it lacks artistic Shakespearean language, Kurosawafs choice of deliberately using black and white, and the characterfs extreme expressions bring out the meaning and images of the story. It is very interesting how Kurosawa emulated Macbethfs Scottish culture with his own culture, Japan. For example, the title Thane of Cawdor is replaced with the title Lord of the North Castle. Throne of Blood is a great movie where viewers can enjoy the storyline of Macbeth and also enjoy Kurosawafs cleverness by comparing Scottish and Japanese culture.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I have to admit that I am a huge fan of The Bends and OK Computer, but got a little lost in the confusing and &quot;hard-to-find-the-hook&quot; music of both Kid A and Amnesiac.  I finally bought this album and at first thought it was heading in the same chaotic direction.  After a couple listens it really caught hold of me.  I have been listening non-stop for about two weeks now and I am finding new favorite songs with nearly every listen.  I would best describe this as a more accessible album than both Kid A and Amnesiac, but not as mainstream as OK Computer or The Bends.  It is a bit depressing, and not really a &quot;rocker&quot;, but who comes to a Radiohead album for the high energy pick-me-up (except the jack-ass who posted earlier).  <br />I don't give five stars, it has to be absolutely phenominal for that, and this album has a few bums, but overall I would recommend this album.  If you already have Kid A and Amnesiac then you might as well pick this one up because it is much easier to get into.
B000002R48|3.0|Yes, Dominici may sound like a stoned C-3PO, but the thing to focus in on, as with all DT, is Petrucci and Portnoy. Altough his crowning moment is on once in a livetime's fantastic 8ish minute solo, you can hear his majestic work loud and clear. And about the lyrics: Dominici sounded slightly like Kc's Robert Fripp, so if you think about him, the vocals are ok.
B00005JM0B|2.0|When I first heard about this movie, I was so thrilled that they were going to continue the Terminator series. I went into the theater with high hopes of being as amazed as I had been with the first two, however, i came out sorely disappointed. There are a number of reasons why I felt this way.<br />They are:<BR>1. James Cameron didn't direct it. It is impossible to have a decent Terminator movie if Cameron isn't directing it.<BR>2. No continuity. There are relatively few connections between T3 and the first 2 movies.<BR>3. No Linda Hamilton. Again, its impossible to have a Terminator movie without her.<BR>4. Too much action, not enough stroy. There are too many action sequences with a very small, weak plot line.<BR>5. Too far-fetched. The TX is way too far-fetched. It's too perfect, it can make its own weapons and reprogram other machines. It would've been better to bring back Robert Patrick as the T-1000.<BR>6. Not the same music. What happened to Brad Fiedel and the main Terminator theme?<br />It must seem like I am a knitpicker who didn't like the movie at all, however, I did enjoy the movie greatly. It was a great action movie, just not worthy of the Terminator name. I'd have to say that the best scene of the movie is at the cemetery when the girl has a conversation with Dr. Soberman from the other two movies.<br />On a final note, after seeing T3, I went home and watched T2: The Ultimate Edition DVD. After the movie was over, I browsed thru the special features and came across an alternate ending confirming that there was no Judgement Day and John Connor became a senator. I think that this would have been a great ending for T2, that way we wouldn't have to deal with the disgrace that is T3.
B000002HPV|5.0|I recently really started digging into the roots of Bjorks music and discovered a new favorite artist of mine. Over the years ive been trapped behind the wall of mainstream music and Access Hollywood nearly falling into the line of obsession in Jennifer Lopez's and Ben Affleck's relationship. A friend told me about Bjork and when I first heard each track, I just had to listen over and over and over again. Unlike her debut and sophmore records this album is dark and daring. Bjork's voice, always the main attraction, soars through cliffs of experimental electronica and huge orchestra bands. Her voice has more of an emotional depth to it, and although this may not featur dance floor hits, her experimentation with new sounds worked to a full effect. After a year of mail bombs and catfights its only reasonable to put out an album with so much more emotion into it than previous efforts. Although I loved Debut and Post, this album changes paces but there is still that same old Bjork everyone grew to love. An alien from another country..some may say but Bjork is much more normal than a good portion of some artists out there. Her voice is captivating in its own sense and takes me into another galaxy with its lows and highs and screams. I ccan't get enough of Bjork, her sounds, voice, and attitude are so delicious and so different. Its what makes Bjork a mystery to herself, and a mystery to all other artists who lack the creativity and orginality that Bjork greatly posesses. That famous slogan undoubtably works for Bjork this time, &quot;Third times the charm!&quot;
B00005JLRT|3.0|Quite honestly, I'm fed up with all of the criticism that ST: Nemesis has been getting. Admittedly, it isn't the best Trek film out there, but it also isn't the worst (ST: The Final Frontier still holds that title). Nemesis had some really great character interactions and acting in it. One thing that a lot of people seem to hate about the movie is that it is a \\"copy\\" off of ST: The Wrath of Khan. Although it shares many similarities with ST: II, it also goes off in dfferent directions and holds its own as a unique movie. Another thing that I've been hearing lately is that the final sequence on the Scimitar was too short and emotionless. However, I think that the scene speaks volumes and is full of emotion<br />Now that I've said what was good about the movie, it's time for the negatives:<BR>1. Bad Director, unfamiliar with Trek world (They should've used Frakes again).<BR>2. Wrong sound effects (None of the phasers, torpedos, or engines sound like traditional Next Gen. movie effects)<BR>3. No Deck 29 (only 24 decks on 1701-E)<BR>4. Different sets (Ready-Room, Quarters, Sickbay all completely different from those in ST: First Contact and ST: Insurrection.<br />All in all, a fairly good Trek movie, however, I would like to see another, better, finale for the TNG cast.<br />And now, I'll end my review with my favorite line of the movie, said by Shinzon to Picard, \\"Now, I'll show you my true nature, our nature, and as Earth dies you will remember that I will always and forever be Shinzon of Remus and that my voice will echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory!\\"
B0000004V2|5.0|Sublime, uplifting, life affirming masterpiece.<br />Removes the need for anyone to ever take drugs again as listening to this album will make you happier and higher than taking crack, heroin and angel dust combined. Should be distributed free at drug rehabilitaion centres.<br />Each killer track flows perfectly into the next. Lyrical references to god, the devil and the bible are appropriate as listening to 'I am the Resurrection' transports you to a higher spiritual plain.<br />Inspiring to know something so god-like and timeless was created by human beings - Genius!
B00005JLH2|4.0|Although it is not a prerequisite, to fully appreciate this film, one has to have been in a black college band. Those of us that fit the bill can relate to the events portrayed here: the stern taskmasters, the long hours of practice, the rivalry between band members and the visiting bands, the majorettes/dance line shaking to the sounds, the alumni expecting to get their monies worth, the intricacies of the halftime performance, and the blossoming romance between some band mates.<br />All of these and more are captured in this entertaining chronicle of band life. While popular Nick Cannon is the star, the best performance goes to Orlando Jones as &quot;Mr. Lee&quot;. The actor is quite effective as the disciplined and dedicated-to-his-craft band director, allowing nothing else to stand in the way of his band producing skilled performances. Previously known primarily for his comic work, Jones gets to really stretch his acting chops here.<br />Hopefully, Hollywood will offer more dramatic work to the actor and he may join the ranks of those performers that alternate between genres.<br />It is also refreshing to find radio personality Jay Anthony Brown helming the role of Jones' rival, the fictional director of Atlanta's Morris Brown College. His conducting swagger only surpasses Brown's pomposity as he leads his &quot;troops&quot;<br />to &quot;battle&quot;.<br />Ranking:<br />5 for the musical numbers and Jones's performance<br />3 for the story<br />= 4 (average)
6305064490|5.0|Back in the 70's I went to see &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; at a theatre that specialized in old movies.  I hadn't heard much about this one but I thought I'd take a chance since it boasted both Jimmy Stewart and Frank Capra.  What a major surprize that screening turned out to be.  It was as though someone had dug up a previously forgotten movie on par with &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.  I don't know how this movie drifted into obscurity for so many years but it has really busted out of it now, hasn't it!<br />What this movie offers is a solid family experience with a lesson for all.  At first it seems like just another &quot;good&quot; movie as we see the life of a young man (Gearge Baily) being recounted by some angels up in heaven.  All seems well but it also appears that the weight of the world keeps getting added to George Baily's back one pound at a time.  In time this happy life reaches a breaking point and then we start to see the real beauty of the story.  George Baily's guardian angel, Clarence, grants him his wish to see what life would be like if he (George Baily) had never been born.  Now all those minor and major incidents in George's life that we saw in the first two thirds of the movie suddenly take on a very special meaning.  We see how those things affected the lives of so many people and (this IS a Capra movie afterall) always for the better.  In case you haven't seen this movie, I'll leave the plot hanging there.  The ending is truly heart-warming.<br />This movie has a lot going for it besides the plot.  The directing is terrific as is usually the case in a Frank Capra movie.  The acting is terrific with Stewart taking the lead as George Baily.  Henry Travers may have been a lesser known character actor in his other roles but he achieved immortality (forgive the pun) as Clarence ASC.  Donna Reed is well-cast as the girl-next-door who grew up to be Mrs. George Baily.  Lionel Barrymore is terrifically sinister in the role of Old Man Potter.There are plenty of others who make this movie great.  Indeed, the nature of the plot has a seemingly record number of role-players who are essential to the story.<br />If you haven't yet seen this movie, then you have been missing a real treat.  When you do get around to seeing it, I recommend that you see it from the start.  It's really impressive the way everything eventually fits together so neatly.  This movie is like a warm hug on a sad day.  It will really pick you up!
B0000A36J1|4.0|The scope of these films in movie history will possibly not be topped, at least in no time soon.  Their worldwide popularity, breaking box office records everywhere, assure that Peter Jackson and company won't have to work another day in their lives.<br />&quot;The Two Towers&quot; delivers in action, emotional impact, scoring, direction, characterization, and brilliant performances (Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Christopher Lee, Sean Astin, and Bernard Hill, standouts among a stellar ensemble) should be the standard for epics to come.  This is obvious by the praise from professional and laymen reviewers alike.<br />The only &quot;downside&quot; is this film's lack of occasional levity.  Based on the &quot;serious&quot; nature of Tolkein's masterpiece and Jackson's desire to be as faithful as possible, humor doesn't quite fit.<br />However, an induced smile would be welcome amongst the opulent battle sequences, the sweeping set pieces, the mystical fairy scenes, and the Hobbits in transit.<br />The only &quot;fun&quot; can be found in watching the schizophrenic Gollum have internal conflicts with his other self.<br />And I find myself feeling a little guilty at smirking at the workings of such a troubled mind.
B000069HZP|4.0|David Fincher, the director behind Se7en and Fight Club, makes an extravagant suspenseful thriller with The Game. The noir-ish theme from Se7en remains, but this isn't a story about a crime being uncovered; only The Game is about a crime in the making (or is it?)<BR>Michael Douglas plays a successful rich businessman (an echo image of Gordon Gekko from Wall Street) who's haunted by his father's suicide. His life is typical; no adventures, just the same old, same old everyday. Things change when he recieves an unusual gift from his younger brother, played charmfully by Sean Penn. Nothing else should be said after this for I do not wish to ruin the plot if you haven't already seen it. But just to give you a glimpse, Michael Douglas' life turns very bumpy, dark, mysterious; in other words, it turns completely upside down in one of the worst nightmarish mind-boggling roller coaster trips any rich successful businessman stuck in a routine and haunted by his past could ever have!<br />Very Recommended!<br />A-
B000002VFW|5.0|Erupting on the international scene with the hit &quot;All Around the World&quot;, Lisa Stansfield was a definite force and this album justly solidified her place in music of the 90's. Her debut album boasts three top ten hits and several tracks that were popular on the world's dance floors. It is an album the consistently delivers and has not lost the spark that it had upon its release in 1990.<br />While she still records and charts in her native England, Stansfield has been somewhat absent from American radio airplay.<br />That, unfortunately, is our loss and we are paying for it with the cookie cutter, soulless ing&eacute;nues' that comprise most of contemporary pop/R &amp; B.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Okay, let me start by saying I listen to a lot (and I do mean a lot) of music, and this includes actual metal (as well as pretty much any other genre you can think of). I know people call this &quot;rap-metal&quot;; well, I hate that label and think it's a terrible way to classify anything. The word &quot;metal&quot; should not be anywhere in the classification of this CD; it's simply not metal, nor does it have any metal influences, period. (If you want metal go listen to Chimaira, Lamb of God, Children of Bodom or I recommend for people looking into this CD you check out Machine Head's new release if you want metal--this is a great CD and may be to some of your likings, though it is much harder than this.) Also, I have always remained steadfast in my disliking for Linkin Park and decided to listen to it all the way through many times only because it was on a list of top CDs of the year by someone with excelent taste. So I put aside my bias and swallowed my pride and decided to review it fairly, and here is my review:<br />I don't hate this album. There, I said it. I'd give it a 2.5 if they'd allow it. It's not awful, but it's certainly not great, and not even all that good. The songs tend to follow the same formula in one of two possibilites: either they try to be loud, or it's soft. There's not much variation between the two and the songs start to sound very similar after a while. There is definitely filler here, but more on that later. Let's break this down:<br />The good (or not-so-bad) about Meteora:<BR>Okay, so, much to my horror, I found myself tapping my foot to some of the songs when they were playing. Some of the songs can be fairly catchy. Every once and a while, though few and far between, they seem to get loud and aggressive (for real though, not their half-hearted attempt as usual), and this can keep my interest. When the lead singer decides to scream (rarely), it keeps my attention even though his scream is fairly weak compared to any hardcore/metalscream. They do some soft stuff that I actually kind of liked: &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; took me off-guard, and is a nice little break on this album, and quite good. Shows some real emotion. &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; is somewhat less impressive, but okay. Some of the songs that may get you tapping your foot and are okay include &quot;Don't Stay,&quot; &quot;Somewhere I Belong,&quot; and &quot;Numb.&quot; &quot;Easier to Run&quot; also shows a little more maturity on the lyrical side and mixes some nice choruses (with an orchestra behind it...what?) with some more heart-felt emotion. An all right song.<br />The bad:<BR>Songs are formulaic. Period. There are no great solos to be found here; no impressive riffs; just power chords used in an unimpressive matter. The music to the louder songs all sounds the same after a few listens. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; is an absolute disgrace. How this song is on this CD is beyond me: it is awful and is a humiliation to rap and metal and every genre inbetween. &quot;Session&quot; is a very below-par instrumental track that serves little purpose to setting mood and certainly doesn't impress with any sort of musical talent. Filler. Brings it down. Really, the biggest problem is the songs sound too similar and they grow old fast. Also, we're not breaking any grounds lyrically here; this is fairly poor song-writing (this is no At the Drive-In folks). Only the songs listed above deserve more than a couple listen and even they grow old too fast. Formulaic music with vocals that don't impress isn't a good combo. I wish the lead singer would decide whether he's angry (and scream) or not (and sing) instead of his inbetween which rarely seems to work (Cedric Bixler is one exception). So let's recap: the music all sounds the same after a few listens; not very impressive vocals; too much filler; and nothing impressive musically.<br />This CD gets old way too fast. There are some songs here you may listen to for a while, but this willend up gathering dust...it just isn't impressive.<br />You may like this if you enjoy listening to pop-radio stations, but know the songs you hear there are probably their best, most-catchy. Don't expect much more. HOWEVER, don't even CONSIDER buying this album unless you already own Rage Against the Machine's live at Olympic Stadium CD. That is a far superior &quot;rap metal&quot; CD. Buying this before that is a terrible decision. This is just not impressive. Sorry kids. Go listen to Boy Hits Car, or something that isn't boring.<br />Overall rating: 42/100 (I recommend you check out Story of the Year instead.)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In The Zone is fantastic!  I love every song on here, but my absolute favorites are Me Against The Music, Showdown, Brave New Girl, and Everytime.  Her ballads are beautiful!  She does have a very nice voice.  Even though you don't like Britney, I'd recommend giving this cd a chance.  It's her best yet!!!
B00006JMXH|4.0|This CD is good. Has a lot of good songs. Most can be obtained by all the other CDs. The only 'real' reason to by this disc is for the first track, &quot;You Know You're Right.&quot; Other than that... it's like a good Nirvana mix... all the aired/good songs on one conievent CD. This disc is a must have for any real Nirvana fan... or some one just starting out. Go buy it.
B00000ICN5|5.0|this virtouso guitarist is one of the best 5 guitarists<BR>in rock\blues with hendrix and clepton !!!!<BR>as a guitarist I recommand this one not just to listen and enjoying it, but to learn from it how blues suppose to sound like !!!!<br />mary had a little lamb.......lalala ...
B000088E6D|5.0|I luv it, I luv it! <BR>Michael is the best singer ever. My dad knew I'd seen him on tv and took a chance that I'd love Michael's type of music and do I ever,ever, ever! And he's HOT! <BR>It's the first time that my dad and I are listening to the same music and agreeing that it's the best.<BR>my best musical Christmas Gift----EVER!
B00006690G|1.0|This album sucks. Eminem thinks he's all that. Now i'm wondering why i even bought this album.  I liked his first song-that was before i actually listen to the lyrics-someone doesnt remember where he came from.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|I thought Finding Nemo was a pretty good movie for kids and grown-ups alike because it teaches us about relationships and the responsibilities involved and how even though we are separated love never dies if it is a parent/child or a romatic interest. Crush will relate to the \\"cool\\" generation, Dorie to the older ones, and of course Nemo to the young ones.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I enjoied this series and was very dispointed when they droped it so suddenly. Thanks to the DVDs I know no why I missed the pilot. Fox needs to get there execs heads out of where they are and smell more then just the dollar waiving in front of there face. The DVDs are great and I've enjoy them everytime I put one in.
0812550706|5.0|I am not a Science Fiction fan.  I stumbled upon this book by accident as a bored ten-year-old.  However, I instantly loved this book, reading it again and again, which I still do today.  Card has the amazing ability to allow you to view the world through the character's eyes.  I would highly recommend this book to ANYONE who just loves a good read.
0451191153|5.0|I'll start right off by saying this: if you can't accept some shocking, startling, controversial ideas (I fully believe that that is the only reason many of the previous reviewers of this book gave it one star), DON'T READ THIS BOOK! It is completely essential for the reader of Ayn Rand's &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; to accept ideas that are different and - in the case of some - differing from one's own. That is what this book is: a differing idea.<br />The only bad point of this book (though not bad enough to detract any stars) is the length. It's amazingly long - not only in length (my copy had 700-something pages) - but in content, if that makes sense. However, it doesn't ever FEEL long. I remember the point where I reached Part Three (at page 502 in my copy). It didn't feel like I'd read 500 pages. However, the length does become an issue when you realize you've been sitting alone for hours.<br />Third I need to mention the characters. Most of them are one-sided. Both female characters - Dominique and Katie - have relationship problems, but this only adds to their character. There is no hero in this book - Roark is ANYTHING but a hero. The characters, I think, are unlike anything put into a book before. However, they're really amazing - GREAT - characters.<br />In closing, I want to stress the fact that you CANNOT read this book if you're not willing to be exposed to differing ideas. This book is perfectly written - amazing style and characters. Read with an open mind!
B00005JLSE|3.0|Aspiring nightclub performer Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) and professional Vera Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) compete for headlines and the attention of their slick lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), in Chicago during the roaring 20's.  The musical numbers are exuberant and the cast acquits itself well, but it is all in service of a very thin story that makes some fairly obvious points about the fleeting nature of fame.  The film presents grasping, unsympathetic characters, but I felt that the filmmakers were trying to make me sympathize with them rather than skewering them for their conceit and self-centeredness.  Queen Latifah delivers a star-making performance.<br />Director Rob Marshall really does his performers a disservice with his rapid MTV cutting between shots.  He should have allowed his cast to generate energy through their performances rather than attempting to construct it with rapid editing and camera angles.  It leaves the question of whether the actors, who are not known for musical ability, were able to deliver sustained high quality performances or whether Marshall had to piece highlights of various takes together to get what he needed.
0312319517|2.0|Many people will buy this book, as I did, based on Forsyth's past successful writings. And perhaps he deserves to be rewarded for The Dogs of War, The Odessa File, and The Day of the Jackal. But buy the book on that basis, a reward for past efforts, not because this is a good read. Because it isn't.<br />Because the protagonist is American, and a lot of the narrative takes place among Americans or on our soil, Forsyth has a vehicle for presenting his political views, something I don't like in any novel, where one is able to present fiction as an underpinning for a belief system.<br />As for the story, Forsyth's ego as an insider privy to state secrets is laughingly portrayed. Republicans are heroes. Democrats are villians, or at least fools. And who hasn't heard of the tunnel rats of Vietnam, that Forsyth says are unknown to most of us. Heck, there's even a tourist attraction in Vietnam that takes people down into the tunnels.<br />But the most annoying parts of Avenger are those action scenes that work out JUST PERFECT for the protagonist. An area is searched except for the one place our hero is hiding. The villain takes a plane at just the right time. A friend is ordered into several positions to help out just where he is needed. A search is made among all embassies except the one where the fortunate hero gets his visa. A federal holiday occurs just when needed.<br />You'll find the rest of these many lucky coincidences if you are kind enough (to Forsyth), rich enough, and not busy enough, to buy and read Avenger.
B00008DDXC|4.0|Chris Columbous is keeping it real and very true to the book in the 2nd movie. I am thrilled through what he did and even though the book was my least favorite of the 5 that are currently released the movie was so good! The DVD version has so many cool effects! You'd love it too. Then-12 Emma Watson, 14 year old Dan Radcliffe, and 15 year old Rupert Grint star in this and are great actors. They truly make this movie worthwhile! Since Chris is no longer directing them :( I don't know if the 3rd movie will be this good-so watch this and enjoy it while you can! Good if you read the books or even if you didn't!
B00008RH1H|5.0|This is a fascinating film.  This is not really, as commonly assumed, a Japanese version of MacBeth.  Kurosawa and his co-workers used the plot of MacBeth as a point of departure to make a superb film about ambition and betrayal.  Set in Medieval Japan during a period of constant turmoil, Throne of Blood uses much of the plot of MacBeth.  There is no effort to use the great language of Shakespeare, rather Kurosawa and his team reimagined MacBeth in a very specific Japanese context.  To substitute for the power and poetry of Shakespeare's writing, Kurosawa uses his distinctive and striking visual style and acting techniques borrowed from Noh theatre.  Use of the latter is particularly appropriate as Noh first became popular and matured as an art form during this period of Japanese history.  Kurosawa also gives this film a undercurrent of Buddhist disdain for superficial aspects of life.  This film is visually striking, gripping in plot, and features wonderful performances, particularly those of Toshiro Mifune and Izusu Yamada as the MacBeth and Lady MacBeth equivalents.  One of Kurosawa's best films.
B00000I2UC|5.0|Jesus &amp; Mary Chain have 2 sets of fans, those who like the feedback drenched &quot;Psychocandy&quot;. And the rest of us, who like everything after. &quot;Automatic&quot; is full of 50's - 60's guitar style rockers played in the JMC way. Perhaps, one little flaw is the drum machine. But you can't deny the sheer power of &quot;Her way of praying&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;Blues from a gun&quot; and the classic &quot;Head on&quot;. Without all the feedback, the songs really come out! They made it a point to stray away from &quot;Psychocandy&quot;'s sound alltogether and sort of reinvented themselves, pissing off their early fans. (Like the reviewer before me). The band made that very clear with the title of their next great album &quot;Honey's dead&quot; in 1992. Get it?
B000089RVX|5.0|We listen to this cd at prayer meetings with my youth group, Winter Team Blue.  Our Group leader has an expression that we apply to this cd.  Whenever we encounter something that lifts us from our spiritual burdens and helps us drop the weight or load of our oppression (prayer, a movie, a song, a Biblical passage) our group leader says  &quot;well, that helped you drop your load&quot;.  We say this a lot about Amy Lee and her band, Evenescence.  In our group we listen to Amy Lee's soaring vocals and deep lyrics whenver we ned to &quot;drop our load&quot;.  So buy this cd and listen to Amy Lee and you too can &quot;drop your load&quot;.<br />peace.
B000002JST|5.0|From the first track to the last, this CD sounds the same give or take the lyrics and guitar solos. The regularity gives AC/DC their difinitive sound. All eight tracks have very catchy guitar riffs to them, and Bon's lyrics fit in very well. The drumming done by Phill Rudd is very accurate and never falls behind. <br />The self proclaimed title &quot;let there be rock&quot;, not only by announcement, but by each song, shows that the boys are able to make some really good songs. If you're looking for straight-foward rock, this is the record for you.
B00005JM0B|4.0|James Cameron wisely chose to step away from directing &quot;Terminator III&quot;, a horrible rehash of cliches and vignettes from the first two films, and with the added bonus of a plot that goes absolutely nowhere! Arnold's back - looking as buff as ever, but acting way too campy to be credible. Remember the scene at the strip club - with the obviously flamboyant, leather clad...or the bit where Claire Danes gets hoisted by Arnold into the air at a gas station - if for no other reason - then just to alert the clerk behind the counter that something's terribly wrong?  The edge of apocalyptic doom is gone from the series. It's been replaced with self-depricating humor that literally destroys the film's credibility from the word go. <BR>TRANSFER: Solid, impressive, well balanced and over all - great visual presentation. Colors are rich. Shadows are nicely rendered. Black levels are black. Smooth DVD transfer with only a hint of shimmering and edge enhancement. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced. <BR>EXTRAS: The usual round of fluff and nonsense that sadly, is in keeping with the feather-weight handling of the film's subject matter.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: This should not have been the final installment in &quot;The Terminator&quot; series!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I personally think that this album is very genuine of dream theater.  It may not be similar to Images and Words, and not have the technical and melodic prowess of Scenes from a Memory BUT It still showcases dream theaters TRUE ability to play their instruments INCREDIBLY well, the songs are amazing.  Portnoy's drumming skills continue to always amaze me.  Although Rudess isnt heard to well on the album his contributions are noticeable and are awesome.  Even though this isnt a melodic drama like SFAM, it's still an amazing album.  I'd recommend this with any other dream theater.
B00005JMCN|5.0|After being indoctrinated with a barrage of Hollywood action/comedy pure breds that run more like a troupe of nags, off to the glue factory, its so refreshing to see a film infused with heart, gusto and that timeless sense of story-telling bravado. &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is the tale of a race horse with everything going against it - a dark horse (pardon the pun)that became a winner and made a Depression ridden USA stand up and cheer. Sure the film is sentimental, schmaltzy, syropy good-fun and intensely melodramatic. Since when did any of these qualities go out of fashion? But what the movie does, is to tell a story with a dramatic arch and wonderful performances - most notably from Toby McGuire and Jeff Bridges. <BR>TRANSFER: Gorgeous, a rich, dated look that perfectly evokes the time period of the story. The DVD is solid with rich colors, natural flesh tones, deep blacks and perfectly rendered shadow and contrast levels. There's a bit of a haze in several scenes, but nothing to distract. A hint of shimmering crops up but in general, digital anomalies are absent. The audio is 5.1 and very well balanced - with a real deep bass that kicks up during the racing scenes.<BR>EXTRAS: A few. They're nice to have but they really don't enhance the viewing experience that much.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: This is classic story-telling at its finest. A rich and sumptuous tale that will live in your heart and memory long after your initial viewing. A must!
B00007G1ZC|1.0|Dreams was very well filmed, but the message was horribly heavy-handed and not feasable.<br />Being at one with nature is nice, but ignoring the realities of modern life and its luxuries is foolish.<br />I was bored during the first half and offended during the second.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This movie is really something wonderful.  Extraordinarily heartfelt.  It takes a lot to get this type of warmth on screen and you would do good to share in it.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I hope this film is re-released in theatres some time; small screens just do not to justice to the Arabian scenery.<br />What can I say that the others have not?<br />Just spectactularly filmed and acted. Perfect
6304539282|5.0|The VHS release of the special edition trilogy is the n<BR>best in the Star Wars series available so far on video. However, is it not time now thhat it should have got to DVD. Is this going to be another opportunity for G Lucas to rip us off?
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Comparing this album to her previous albums, I must admit it is different in many ways, but an excellent album all the same. Unlike many bands(artists) she actually is not afraid to go in a different direction. She implied the use of effects and overdubbing much more than eariler recordings. Though, if you break down the songs the music is still wonderfully heart-felt. There are still many similarities to her older records, such as, the brutily raw guitar solos(which I love so much) and the beauty of her voice when she just lets the lyrics float. As far as the lyrics go many reviewers are calling them trite... Well, I don't understand how someone can judge when we are just speculating on what she is singing about. I believe if you crawl in her head you would find the wonderful depth you have missed. All and all another stellar album from Sarah McLachlan.
078062999X|5.0|all i have to say is that if you are a fan of kenneth branagh or hamley, you will LOVE this movie
B0000E1WKE|5.0|MY favorite song on this album is &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; featuring Bobbi Kristina. I was absolutely amazed at her voice and I think she sounds wonderful. My daughter absolutely loves that song and plays it over and over and over. Whitney did a great job on this album and I am surprised it is not getting more exposure. For those of you who don't like Whitney or Bobbi Kristina's singing PLEASE REMEMBER THAT SHE IS JUST A CHILD - NO NEED TO CRUCIFY HER FOR THE ILL FEELINGS YOU MAY HAVE TOWARDS HER MOTHER - EVEN IF YOU THINK SHE SOUNDS AWFUL - SHE IS JUST A CHILD DOING WHAT HER MOTHER TELLS HER - I THINK SHE SOUNDS GREAT....Whitney is Human Lighten Up....I am sure we all have some / several things inour lives we are not proud of - ours is just not exposed because we are not FAMOUS...GET OVER IT...I LOVE WHITNEY..SHE HAS MADE SOME BAD CHOICES BUT SHE SOUNDS GREAT!!!

0517548232|5.0|Rather than explaining why this is a good book (other revierw's do that), I'll explain why some of the idiotic criticisms levied against this book are wrong.<br />The most silly criticism of Hazlitt (and other Austrian free-market economists) is that they aren't &quot;scientific&quot; and in short &quot;don't use enough math&quot;. This is an absurd criticism. Firstly, human beings are not deterministic particles who's behaviour can be predicted by simple equations. Any attempt to reduce human behaviour to some mathematical equation is pure non-sense. We must consider human beings as individual entities who can choose, not fixed constants in mathematical formuli. <br />Secondly, there is a mathematics that is relevant to Austrians. It is chaos theory and network theory. Chaos theory is currently used to predict the weather. The calculus used by Keynes and other idiots like him is completely useless for describing the behaviour of chaotic systems where individual choice is involved. Hazlitt may not mention Chaos Theory. For that, see Murray N. Rothbard, &quot;Choas Theory: Destroying Mathematics from Within?&quot;; and Gene Callahan, &quot;Why Austrians Should Care About Network Science&quot;. Anyone with any sympathy for Keynes and his idiotic followers should note that Keynes put forth a &quot;treatise&quot; before General Theory, which was demolished by Hayek. Hayek then made a strategical mistake in not demolishing General Theory, feeling that the book's idiocy stood for itself. Also note that while Hayek recieved a Nobel Prize for work which was basically an extension of Mises business cycle theory (Mises died the year before Hayek's Nobel), Keynes received no Nobel, showing that even the dimwits awarding that title realized Keynes work was inherently worthless.<br />The next criticism is related to the first: that Hazlitt doesn't discuss game theory. The reason for this is that game theory is particularly unworthy of discussion. Nash, founder of Game Theory, showed that in any finite game, there's an equilibrium in which no player can improve his or her outcome given the other player's strategies (the Nash Equilibrium). This is problematic in several ways. Firstly, there is absolutely no relation between the playing of games (which are less than net-zero, with one winner and one or more losers) and economics. Secondly, only Game Therorists behave in real situations in the ways in which Game Theory predicts. Thirdly, strategies are not data, but choices. Fourth, it is possible to break out of the specified game to achieve a superior result.<br />One particularly ignorant reviewer says that in a completely unhampered free market, monopolies form, destroying competition. This is non-sense. Empirically, Ancient Ireland was a completely Stateless society for a thousand years, with a completely unhampered free market, and no-such thing occured. And of course it is a bunch of non-sense that can't happen in reality anyeways. A monopoly is only harmful if you have monopoly prices. But in a completely free market, even if someone obtains 100% of all (say) rail-roads, there is still competition between that form of transportation and other forms, thus monopoly prices cannot be charged. The only time real monopolies with monopoly pricing have emerged is because of State interference.<br />This may not be the best book on economics that you can read (look to Mises' &quot;Human Action&quot; for what is most likely the strongest treatise on &quot;economics&quot; [actually praxeology, a much larger field]) ever written.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My family and I had the opportunity to see Wicked in San Francisco in June '03 while it was still somewhat in development.  We all fell in love with it instantly, but we needed to wait until December for the recording to become available.  The recording is somewhat different (&quot;Which Way's the Party&quot; has now become &quot;Dancing Through Life,&quot; and Robert Morse has been replaced by Joel Grey), but the two critical components, Kristin and Idina, and here, and the recording captures their energy beautifully.  &quot;The Wizard and I,&quot; &quot;Defying Gravity,&quot; and &quot;For Good&quot; are the standouts, but &quot;Popular, &quot;One Short Day,&quot; and &quot;I'm Not That Girl&quot; will also grab your attention.  If you've seen the musical, this will bring back the memories.  If you haven't, buy this recording now, and go to the musical when you have the chance.  In the end, you'll find that this feeling isn't loathing (as in the song), but thrill.
B00005JMFR|1.0|I thought the first Matrix movie was a decent movie. It had a great concept, but it was by no means as good of a movie as it was hyped up to be.<br />The following two movies take horrible turns. The Matrix no longer resembles the real world, and bizarre characters are introduced. The Matrix is extremely surreal, which totally goes against what it was meant for in the first place. Am I wrong?<br />The plot is even more bizarre than the new characters. The Matrix: Reloaded and Revolutions are possibly the two most pretentious movies of all time. I don't care how complicated dialogue can be written or how extreme action sequences can be, it doesn't mean it will be interesting. The plot twists and turns and leads nowhere. For all the questions posed, there are no answers. Nor did I ever care if there were any answers. The movies failed to generate any sort of interest. These movies tried to bring the concept of the Matrix to new depths, but fails miserably.<br />Then there's the cheesy theme of hope and love for Neo, which again fails to generate interest. I almost vomited whenever I heard \\"I believe in you Neo.\\" How ... cheesy. Reloaded disappointed me so much, but for the sake of completion I went to see Revolutions. It was one of the most agonizing movie experiences in my life. It definitely beats out The Godfather: Part Three for the worst conclusion to a trilogy. The little bit of satisfaction I got from seeing this entire trilogy is that I never have to go back and see it again.
B00008AWOD|5.0|I heard Placebo first in Cruel Intentions, catchy and pop, dismissed them as good but just that.  Came upon this cd recently, and yeah, wow.  Think blur remixed by velvet underground on E, with thom in the studio.  Listen to track 1, 2, then buy.  I'm never wrong.
B000089RVR|5.0|Being a rock/metal fan I was unsure of this cd. It is well written in every aspect, and worth the purchace price. I have not heard her other cd, but if it is similar to this release, I am sure it is pretty good. Most people know of Dido through the Eminem song &quot;Stan&quot; which is sad, learning about a talented artist through a &quot;artist&quot; like Marshall Mathers. <br />Marshall proves the stupidity of the American youth...don't believe me, YOU make a cd about homosexuals and vicodin and watch how fast it sells..it won't, but let Andre Young(Dr.Dre) produce it and it will fly off the racks at your local record shop. It is good to know that in today's society, there is still decent music out there, and Life for Rent is better than a decent release. Buy this CD, and burn your Eminem and 2Pac CD's
B00005JM0B|4.0|This Terminator is worth watching,filled with action,explosives and stunts,theres only one thing I hate bout this movie and I tell why.The only thing I hated bout this movie is the the title has nutthin to do with the movie,no machines came out until the end,the starting rising like in the last 2 seconds of the film,the only machines I saw rising was the original Terminator,and they had like 2.The movie is excellent,but the only machines u will be seeing in this movie is Arnold and the <br />T-X.This movie is worth watching, TRUST ME.
0679428895|4.0|This was my first book by Robert Harris, so I can't compare it to his previous work like some of the other reviewers. I was hooked from the first couple of pages.  Yes, there's a lot of science and technical info in the book, but I didn't find it boring at all.  Rather, it was integral to the story, like the quotes from the scientific books at the beginning of each chapter. Not boring at all, in fact, it made me want to go back to school to take a class on the history of the Roman Empire, or to travel to the ruins to see for myself. To me, when a book can make me so interested that I want to learn more, now that's a good book.
B00008AY3L|4.0|This is definitely not one of Ben's best works. However, regardless of how it stacks up against his past releases this is still one of the best albums of the year when compared to a lot of the other messes being released lately. <br />This is probably Ben's most diverse album, and he explores the many different extremes of his talents from strong reggae tracks (the wonderful &quot;With My Own Two Hands&quot;), or the more Hendrix type rockers such as &quot;Temporary Remedy&quot;. However, in my opinion this album shines the brightest in it's softer moments. His version of Dylan's &quot;Diamonds On The Inside&quot; is tremendously done, and &quot;Amen Omen&quot; is easily one of my favorite Harper songs ever. <br />Overall, this isn't his best release and if you are new to his works I recommend checking out his live release &quot;Live From Mars&quot;. However, don't be scared away by all the negative reviews of this release because it's still definitely worth your time if you are a fan!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|It's hard to compare this record with the Spector version of Let it Be, specially if you don't listen to both or if you don't know these tracks very well.<BR>Some of the great work is noticed on tracks such as Long and Winding Road, Across the Universe that (Thank God) lost the Spector mess.<BR>What you will notice is that the vocals are improved (you can actually hear it better) and the guitars as well.<BR>What you won't get is the talking between the songs (like that at the beginning of Two of Us) - That is left to the Fly On The Wall disc.<BR>If you been hearing a lot of bootlegs from that period like Get Back Journals or Thirty Days this' a huge improvement though it doesn't add any &quot;new&quot; song...just made them better and studio-like production.<BR>Get this album for your collection, even if you prefer the old one...hear how a great band can play despite what was going on at the time.<BR>Highly recommended.
B00008NG5V|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums in a long time. I loved Jack's first release, but this one even manages to beat it by a stride. It makes me sad when I read all the reviews on here bashing this release for various reasons. DMB-rip off, too simple, etc... It makes me sad, because so many people are missing the point. Nothing here is supposed to be groundbreaking. It's not even written to be highly successful. Jack is simply writing for fun, to relax, and to share good times with friends and family. Which is exactly what this album is great for.<br />The whole idea here (atleast for me) is to just turn it up, relax, and step back and truly enjoy your life. There's something about this music that makes me think of long drives in the summer around dusk, and if that's not a comforting thought, I don't know what is. <br />Tracks like \\"Times Like These\\", \\"Horizon Has Been Defeated\\", and \\"Taylor\\" are extremely fun and bouncy and can't help but brighten the mood. While some of the tracks later on in the album such as \\"Cookie Jar\\" may not be as upbeat, the message is still a positive one, and a great listen. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who is looking to slow things down a bit and just enjoy life as it comes.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I bought it close to when it came out and was delighted to hear most of the tracks i had loved then and didnt have the money to buy all the different albums so i bought this, You Know You're Right is as good and better than their earlier songs
B00004RF9B|5.0|Commander J. J. Adams (Leslie Nielson) leads a crew of deep space explorers on a mission to Altair 4, to check on a colony there. Altair 4 is a psychedelic planet with a green sky. Upon arrival, Adams and company find only one man named Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) and his daughter Altaira (Anne Francis- one of the sexiest women in ANY galaxy) alive. Morbius explains that the others were killed by some strange, unseen force. Morbius is a solemn, mysterious sort of guy himself, and it's apparent that he's not telling the whole truth. He's built a virtual paradise in the middle of a wasteland, complete with a forest, deer, and a tiger. Morbius also has a robot named Robby, who does all of the menial labor around the stellar estate. Adams and his men soon learn that all is not well on Altair 4. An unstoppable, invisible entity is unleashed, tearing crewmembers to pieces, while absorbing their laser blasts into it's incredible mass. Adams and his first mate learn that Morbius has tapped into a vast computer network (about the size of Cleveland), left behind by a now extinct race of super-beings called &#34;the Krell&#34;. Somehow, using this network, Morbius can release his &#34;id&#34; to do his insane bidding. Will anyone be going back to earth at all? Can the invisible horror be defeated? Will Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis live on to star together again in Funny Girl with Barbra Streisand? Watch and see. Highly recommended...
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|While the Strokes are called by &quot;musicians&quot; actual &quot;talent&quot;, it would be helpful if they spoke coherent sentences, or had actual melody. I don't even have anything to say about it.
B000127LW2|4.0|Like STNG and DS-9, Voyager also got off to a slow start in it's first season. Characters were shallow and the stories were (with a few exceptions) unremarkable.  The show began to improve quickly though, once the cast and writers got their 'space legs'.<BR>I believe Voyager eventually became as good as any of the other Trek series.<BR>  My biggest gripe is about the price of this first season.<BR>You'd think that for a shortened season and as an introduction to the series Paramount would price this more reasonably.<BR> ...
B000069CWE|5.0|Many were first turned off by the idea of a re-mix album from a band that had only come out with one other album. This didn't stop Reanimation from becoming the most-sold re-mix album ever. Reanimation includes the classics-such as an amped up &quot;One Step Closer&quot; featuring Korn's Johnathan Davis, and the previously unreleased, such as the popular &quot;My December&quot;, whose original version had previously been only available on-line or on demo CDs. Reanimation is essential to any rock fan's list (or hip-hop, for that matter) for its excellent and crystal-clear quality of high-brand nu-metal.
B00000IPAX|4.0|awsome cd great,songs, whats my age again,dumpweed,american pie theme song,small things, must have cd
B000002B7Y|4.0|This is the third Ozzy album I bought ( after Blizzard and Diary ) and I was very impressed!  I still listen to it a lot.  Zakk Wylde's playing is certainly different from that of Randhy Rhoads, but equally as good.  The solo in Miracle Man still gives me shivers.  The bass is nice and the drums are also powerful...plus if you like the 80's drum sound, this is a good album.  Ozzy's voice sounds different on this album than on Blizzard Of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman, but there's nothing wrong with that -- just gives more variety!<br />     I also like Devil's Daughter, Crazy Babies, and Hero.  I like the other ones, too, but I listen to the first three songs the most.  Crazy Babies has a nice solid groove and the rest of the songs shine as well.  <br />     If you like Zakk Wylde's guitar playing and metal in general, this is an essential album to have!!!!!!!  You won't regret buying it!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|sometimes i'll buy a cd and listen to it for around a month, and then stop.  i've had this cd since it came out, and ive always loved it.  i always come back and listen to this cd.  its so great, and i can find a song that is good for a certain mood.  if i feel sad, i listen to my immortal, if i'm feeling semi-suicidal, i listen to my last breath, if i feel kinda out of it, i listen to imaginary.  i absolutely love this cd. i think i'll listen to it for a long long time.... <br />it doesnt feel like one of those &quot;fad&quot; cds.  that you buy just to have it and then throw it out later.  this cd goes with me almost everywhere.
B00000I8UF|4.0|I had heard excellent critics about this album for years. I decided to buy it after listening two of its pieces. Excellent! I thought. And I can reassure that I was not wrong. It is an irreproachably well performed album. <br />After listening to it many times, despite what I have just written before, I should admit that whenever Bobby Timmons appears, I simply hear that part of the piece. Though I'm aware that he is the composer of the very &quot;Moanin'&quot;, but in my opinion his performance is not as strong as his composing. I think that he is just a discreet sideman but Blakey would have prefered a different one. This is the only reason of my 4 stars.<br />Anyway, it is a very recommendable album for any jazz lover. Very good bop, with a great deal of swing, with Blakey stunning, impacting on your ears with his pace and strength. Lee Morgan and Benny Golson as never imagined. In other words, my advice is: &quot;You better buy it&quot;.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I got this CD as a gift and love it.  I've seen them live (before they made it big) and i've always thought they are pretty good.  Even though this may be different than their other albums,  i think it's pretty good and worth owning.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I think the Platinum editions of the Lord of the Ring movies are great.  This one, like the Fellowship, adds tons of deleted scenes and commentary that really completes the movie in a way.  Definetly worth the cost.
B00004T9UF|1.0|And I thought DMX was bad....oh man was I ever wrong.  Slim Shady what a joke!  Why do people find this music so cool?  Maybe there immature personality is inner locked with there dying need to be cool so they think this music is oh-so awesome and they rush out and buy the CD and dress like a saggy clown on crack.  People WAKE UP!!  Eminem is the worst of the worst when it comes to rap and he doesn't even really try.<BR>Yeah he makes the world feel so sad for him in his movie 8 Mile but what about the millions of other people out there who have it worse than him.  Go cry a river in the corner Marshall Matters, mary mother of satan stop being such a baby!<BR>And you want to know something else people?  I have never heard someone talk about themselves and there CD's so much in my life yet make millions of dollars just talking about it?  Jealous....not really, just trying to make a point that if you bought this CD or any of his CD's that you are the stupid one because you just bought an album that talks about Slim Shady and Slim Shady only.  You are the one's who need to realize what a mistake you have made!<BR>So overall I think Eminem is by far the worst idiot to ever walk the face of the earth and needs to have the crap kicked out of him.  He tried to kill his wife, shoot Violent J from ICP, and turned millions of guys into wanna-be thugs.<BR>Do not buy this album or any of them....BURN THEM and BURN HIM!!<br />Eminem ~ Negative 140 stars  out of  10 stars
6305127638|5.0|An excellent Star Trek movie for hardcore fans or the occasional viewer.  Jam packed full of action, drama, awesome effects, everything..
0385504209|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read.  It was both suspenseful and simultaneously educational.  What a great way to convey information  about art and religion that may otherwise bore the average person.  I could not put this book down and I was sorry when it was over.  I am looking forward to reading more Dan Brown novels.
B000067CQK|1.0|As many others have complained this album is NOT an accurate reproduction of one of the all time classic rock albums. To reiterate, issues with peices of sound from the original release are missing, Left and Right channels have been swapped, Sound quality is only &quot;OK&quot; when compared to some previous releases of this album, the packaging while having lots of pics and info is cheap and shoddy. 30th Anniversary indeed! Some marketing guy saw a cheap way to make the company an easy buck here. Either that or they are simply incompetent,   You choose! <br />This release is just another reason to hate record companies and creates an US and THEM attitude which obviously manifests itself in the pirating of more music. A feeling that they continually try to rip us off creates the reaction &quot;Well screw them, I wont pay,  I will pirate&quot;.<BR>I dont think the record company have done themselves or David Bowie any favours with this release.<br />Unless you are an ardent collector give this version a miss.
B000089RVX|5.0|I remember first hearing about Evanescence of May of this year. Quite oddly, I was a bit creeped out by &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; when I first heard it but it quickly grew on me. I soon found myself loving the song. Then, after listening to a few more of the songs, I finally got the album and had no regrets at all. <br />There are many words to describe &quot;Fallen,&quot; one of them being, quite frankly: amazing. This album is filled with songs that will honestly not disappoint you. They bit horribly off of Lacuna Coil's style (Lacuna is my favorite band) but still, they have their own style that is just wonderful. Amy Lee's soaring vocals are really quite strong and haunting.<br />I would say that all of the tracks stand out remarkably well but here are some that are just beautiful as well as rough and edgy:<br />*Bring Me To Life<BR>*Everybody's Fool<BR>*My Immortal<BR>*Tourniquet<BR>*Imaginary<br />The lyrics remain strong and passionate throughout the entire album. The mix of rock, metal, and goth is just purely blended and makes for an excellent album.
B00005JLEX|5.0|We all know this is the greatest show of all time...but I just read today that George and Elaine backed out of interviews for the upcoming DVD because they wouldn't get paid for it. Apparently only Seinfeld and Larry David are getting money for all the syndication rights which apparently still generates millions of dollars. <br />As a plea to Jerry and Larry, come on!! You can give up some profits just to hear George talk about his Worlds Collide Theory or how every day I get down on my knees and thank god that I have access to him and his dementia.
B0000E1WNV|4.0|Was lucky enough to be at this concert and it brought back great memories. Unlike other recordings, really gives you a feel of being there and the sound quality is not that bad,contrary to other reviews. Prefer it to the NYC DVD in that the NYC concert is too slickly produced - feels more like a video than a concert. This one gives you the real feel of a concert. <br />The crows really made this concert and you get that feeling with this DVD.
B000002OMN|5.0|This album finally got Meat Loaf the recognition that he deserved.  It's a shame that it took them so long to realize how talented he really is.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Unfortunatly, I am not allowed to select a &quot;no star&quot; opition, but that is what this movie diserves.  Loud special effects DO NOT make movie.  There was somethings missing from this one, shall we call it writng?  It's a shame George, you have to go and make you millions, hmmm?  Coun't leave as-is alone could ya?  Maybe next tiem you will think twice before scarring a classic trilogy for the rest of us!
0790743523|5.0|Treasure of Sierra Madre features Humphrey Bogart at his very best.  As down and out Fred Dobbs, he spends his days hitting up others for money, (Hey mister, can you stake a fellow American to a meal?)  He is so fixated on the money in the people's hands, that he doesn't even see their faces.  He hits up the same man in the same suit three different times for meal money.<br />Eventually, he hears an old grizzled prospector (Walter Huston)talk about the riches available to them in the mountains in the form of gold.  The old man had a desire to go back if he could find a couple of younger men who would like to go.  Along with Tim Holt, Bogart and the older man head for the hills in search of wealth.<br />Even before they get there, the old man has warned the younger men about the dangers of finding a lot of gold.  Their hearts will turn greedy and wicked, he said.  Bogart says that once he got a few thousand dollars worth, that would be enough for him.  The beauty of the film is the simple irony of that statement.  Bogart's transformation into the obsessive, gold loving man he becomes is amazing.  He can trust no one, even the two men he is partnered with.<br />During their time in the hills, they encounter several memorable characters who are all trying to either kill them, steal their gold, or both.  At least that's the way Dobbs looks at them.  Most notable is the bandito Alfonso Bedoya who does not say &quot;We don't need no stinkin badges&quot;, rather &quot;I don't have to show you any stinkin badges&quot;.  This, like Casablanca's &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot; is one of the most missed quotes in movie history.<br />The ending of the film is both logical and tragic.  In the end, all we can say is that Bogart's character is one of the most interesting character studies we have witnessed on film.  We are left to ask if something like that could really happen to us.  Could we become this focused on something and forsake all that is so important to us?  According to this film, it's very possible.

B000089RVX|5.0|This is an incredible cd. Their mix of classical and hard rock is very cool. Amy's angelic voice complimetns the music. If you like Evanescence's slower songs such as 'My Immortal' definately try to get a hold of their previous album 'Origin' and their EPs 'Sound Asleep' and 'Whipser'. You will not be dissapointed. I actually like their previous work better, so that says a lot about this album.
B000089RVX|5.0|Overrated? ARE YOU CRAZY? This cd is a powerfull blend of Amy lees operetic vocals and ben moody's awesome guitar skills and leaves me even more content on my buy every time i listen to it. The lyrics are the ventings of 2 very ordinary people. The music adds jsut the right flavor to the cd so a younger audience may enjoy it too. If i had to choose 1 cd to have for the rest of my life, this would be it because it is timeless no matter who you are, you can find a song or 6 that fit you so well its like she knows u.
0375432302|5.0|I found this book as entertaining as enlightening. I learned a lot about history, the one you don't usually learn, and I truly enjoyed reading it. I wanted to keep going with out finishing it. It is fascinating the way the author talks about Paris' landmarks such as The Louvre. It is absorbing the way Da Vinci is present in this story.<br />I definitely recommend this book. It has become for me a NEW CLASSIC.
B00005QDW1|5.0|As an `Intro' to \\"Rock Steady\\" Gwen says it's a `Hella Good' CD and `Hey Baby' all the kids are `Making Out' and getting `Underneath it All' and oh by the way, where's the `Detective' and `Don't Let Me Down' because we don't want to `Start the Fire' of the vanities while `Running' from said detective.  She turns to her friends and says it's all `In My Head' these tragic things in our kingdom, it must be because of the `Platinum Blond Life' I'm living and I always seem to be stuck in the `Waiting Room' when I want to be rocking but I'm going to continue to try to `Rock Steady' and enjoy the huge success of this CD!<br />Simply put, \\"Rock Steady\\" is an extraordinarily good CD that is replete with exceptional and eclectic music from one of the industries best groups!  Few CD's match what this one does as every single song, from the first to the last, is perfect.  Gwen Stefani's drop dead magnificence and that marvelous voice of hers carries every song along with the remarkable beat that each one possesses.  No trip down the highway is complete for me without listening to this CD and it is certainly a plus to find a radio station that plays tunes from this brilliant CD.  I highly recommend this CD to any and all fans of this type of music!  {ssintrepid}
B00005JMTQ|5.0|Rarely do you see a film nowadays that is so perfectly cast, well scripted and beautifully directed.  Something's Gotta Give is a romantic comedy that deserves to stand among such classics as When Harry Met Sally, Annie Hall, The Philadelphia Story, and It Happened One Night. It stands out like a diamond in the rough among so many of the flimsy plots that litter most of the comedy films that have graced the silver screen these past few years.  Diane Keaton delivers what is possibly the best performance of her career as uptight playwright, Erica Barry, who has given up all hope on love, when an unexpected turn of events turns her world upside down.  With the most subtle of expressions and gestures, Keaton is able to make us laugh as we've never laughed before; she says what she means, she expresses how she feels and she does it all with that grace and talent that has captivated audiences for years.  Nicholson, in a role which seems to have been written for him, delivers a performance that tops his brilliant portrayal of the obsessive compulsive Melvin  Udall in the 1997 film, As Good as It Gets.  As the eccentric, yet undeniably loveable character of Harry Sandborne, Nicholson plays a debonair older man who has a reputation for dating younger women.  The combination of his character and Keaton's provides for a seemingly endless supply of witty banter and comical yet touching, and at times deeply moving, scenes that will have you rolling in the aisles with laughter.  This film captures the warmth and enchantingly elusive quality that characterizes the best films of all time.  With a supporting cast that includes delightful and perfectly cast performances from Frances McDormand, Keanu Reeves and Amanda Peet, this film seems to be too good to be true.  One of those rare films that gets better with each viewing, Something's Gotta Give deserves to garner, at the very least, Oscar nominations for Keaton's and Nicholson's brilliant performances, Nancy Meyers refreshingly clever and hilarious script, and the beautiful art direction.   Something's Gotta Give served as a much needed breath of fresh air, proving to audiences that the art of filmmaking and the acting profession still have what it takes to charm, seduce and captivate audiences.  A true classic film.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|It is almost unbelievable to me that after the fantastic return album IM came out with another one. This is great since it entails me going out and buy new music since releases from all other new rock bands are only useful as coasters.<br />One, three five years from now noone will remember grunge and all of the talentless filler produced by overpaid college kids punk-wannabe over the last 13 years (the worse ever period for rock music).<br />This album is not a 5 , but it is certainly a 4. Classic maiden style tracks. Given the times we live in, this is 4 stars material by default. Thanks guys for producing new music.
0060934719|3.0|I really enjoyed both Good Omens and Neverwhere (the latter is one of the most memorable books I've read). I'm somewhat disappointed with Stardust. The first half of the book is really good, but I suspect that, round about the time Tristran and company finish up at the Sign of the Chariot, Gaiman took a look at the broad swathes of plot he was developing (well) and decided that he just couldn't be bothered finishing it properly.<br />A lot of what follows reads more like a dense plot outline than a novel. Lots of interesting ideas, none of which are properly fleshed out, and a number of clever but too rapidly effected conclusions to plot threads nourished in Stardust's earlier chapters. The last twenty or so pages are delivered with a teeth-grinding artificiality that is so far below what Gaiman achieved in Neverwhere (and in the first half of Stardust) that it left me feeling a little angry. To come so far and finish with so little? What a letdown.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina, Christina. Man!...Why did you have to name this album &quot;Stripped.&quot; That is probably the worst decision of your career. The album is fantastic; from the inspirational melodies, to the &quot;Girl Anthems.&quot; The album title totally throws off the whole album...<br />I loved this album for so many reasons. One reason is that there is a meaning behind each and every song. &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; is a song about double-standards, and how women shouldn't give in to men. &quot;Fighter&quot; is a song about becoming stronger in life, while you are going through tough times. &quot;Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Loving Me 4 Me&quot; and &quot;The Voice Within&quot; are songs about trusting your heart and always listening to it, and loving yourself for who YOU are.<br />There are many songs that could've been singles other than the five that have been released. &quot;Infatuation&quot;- a love ballad about a Spanish boricua, and their LOVE story...&quot;I'm Okay&quot; is a song that describes the abusive father and husband that her mother and herself went through. &quot;Make Over&quot; is a ROCK song that says: &quot;I don't need nobody trying to make me over, I just wanna live simple and free.&quot;<br />Be yourself. Don't give in...
B00008PW2D|2.0|SATC went downhill after the fourth season. I guess they ran out of original ideas or concepts. The fifth season was exceptionally lame.
B000001Y79|5.0|Gwen Stefani is making her way through magical `Spiderwebs' and runs across a stranger and she says to the man, `Excuse Me Mr.' `But I'm Just a Girl' and are you `Happy Now' that there are `Different People' who continue to enjoy No Doubt's magical musical success?\\"  He says, `Hey You,' little girl but it's `The Climb' to the top that's difficult and with this CD you've made it but if you were only `Sixteen' and it was `Sunday Morning' I'd tell you `Don't Speak', `You Can Do It' while the `World Go' Round' and `I'll End it On This', the `Tragic Kingdom' you've made for yourself is a wonderful world, you go girl!\\"<br />I don't and won't pretend to say that I'm completely up with all the terminology of today's music and such, I don't even know what the term ska means.  What I will say though is that when it comes to tooling down the highway, no trip is complete without listening to this particularly superb CD.<br />Often times, a group such as No Doubt will produce a CD and there'll be but a scant few exceptional songs on them and the rest are a spurious waste of time; that is simply not the case with \\"Tragic Kingdom!\\"  Every song on this CD is a superb wonder and highly enjoyable to listen to.<br />Adding to the extraordinary flavor of this CD is not only the beautiful voice that the extremely gorgeous Gwen Stefani possesses but also the eclectic nature of the songs on this CD.  From punk to reggae to pop, \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" is replete and an overwhelming joy to listen to from the first song to the last!  I highly recommend this CD to any and all fans that enjoy this type of music!  {ssintrepid}
B000092ZYX|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to review the latest effort from Radiohead.  I'm not going to delve into how &quot;political&quot; this album is, but every time I listen to it I can't help but pick up on the raw beauty that lies in each song whether it's the lyrics, tinkering sounds, bass/drum lines, and whatnot. <BR>If there is one thing that pisses me off in regards to Radiohead are the &quot;fans&quot; who gripe about how much the band no longer churns out songs from The Bends/OK Computer era.  For one, Radiohead's musical evolution is interesting to listen to and I for one fully support their musical experiments.  Some will say that this album goes back to the albums mentioned previously, but I ask the listener not to look for another one of those albums.  This album in unique in it's own way and has quickly come to be one of my favorites. It's rare for me to like every single song on an album, and this is one of those instances.<BR>&quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; is the perfect introduction for this album.  It slowly builds up and then at the right moment, kicks you in the ass. &quot;Sail To The Moon&quot; is one of my absolute favorites on this album.  I'll admit, there are moments when this song can bring me to tears.  &quot;Where I End And You Begin&quot; is probably my favorite song on the album. I love the bass line and there is a spooky quality to the song that just attracts me.  &quot;There There&quot; is the strongest song on the album followed by &quot;A Punchup At A Wedding.&quot;  &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; reminds me so much of another Radiohead favorite of mine, &quot;Idioteque&quot; from Kid A.  This song has the ability to make me just want to dance.  The album ends with another one of my favorites, &quot;A Wolf At The Door.&quot;  It is not what I would have expected Radiohead to end this album to, but I love it.  It took me a few days to get the lyrics down to sing along to it but my friends get a laugh when I sing the &quot;dance you f**ker&quot; part.<BR>It has quickly become a staple in my cd collection and I believe it is one of the, if not the, best release of 2003.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Visually beautiful, a great story and Bill Murrays best performance to date. Easily the best movie of 2003.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We know that Kristen Chenoweth is amazing, and most Broadway junkies know that Idina Menzel is amazing, but when they both get together, who would have thought that they could become even more amazing? When these two ladies sing together, audiences are hearing magic. Thank Goodness there are many songs when they are featured together. As good as they are together, it is also great to hear them both on their own. Early on, those who don't know Ms. Menzel, are introduced with the powerhouse solo moment 'The Wizard and I'. If you love Broadway music, there are lots of different styles in this show, although for the most part it is pop/rockish. Even in a show with the amazing rock belting of Idina Menzel, we also get to hear Kristin Chenoweth's lovely operatic voice. There couldn't have possibly been better choices for Glinda/Galinda and Elphaba/The Witch. These fantastic Broadway divas will take this show to the top! Can't wait to see what happens at the Tonys! I encourage everyone to buy this recording so they can be witnesses to a magical Broadway moment when two stars made magic on the stage.

Good thing Jack came between Rose and that bad mean guy!!! J.D. &amp; Rose 4ever!!!!
B00005JLR6|4.0|An Irish family, grief-stricken after the death of their young son, moves to New York City to start their lives afresh. With little to their names besides the clothes on their backs, Sarah (Samantha Morton), Johnny (Paddy Constantine), and their two daughters, Christy (Sarah Bolger) and Ariel (Emma Bolger), move into a run-down tenement occupied mostly by drug addicts and misfits. The girls make the acquaintance of a reclusive African artist (Djimon Hounsou) who lives downstairs from them, and that unusual friendship helps see the family through their grief and recover their hope for the future and for each other.<br />\\"In America\\" was inspired by two events in the life of its writer and director, Jim Sheridan. Sheridan's brother died when he was a child, and, as an adult, he illegally immigrated with  his family to New York in the 1980s. Sheridan has combined these two seminal events into one generation with the help of his two daughters, Naomi and Kirsten Sheridan, who contributed their childhood memories to the screenplay. \\"In America\\" is the story of a family that deals with great loss by uprooting itself and making a new life in an entirely different environment. Already emotionally estranged from one another, they become strangers in a new world. Once a working class family in Ireland, they now struggle with poverty in New York. And this somehow cures their ills. While I was watching this film, I was captivated by its dreamlike quality and impressed with the terrific cast. The story is narrated by Christy, a precocious 10-year-old who documents her world and her feelings with her ever-present camcorder. The actresses who play Christy and her younger sister Ariel really are sisters, and they give some of the most charming and impressive performances by child actors that I have ever seen. Samantha Morton is also particularly good as their broken-hearted mother, Sarah. The character that serves as a catalyst for emotional change, Mateo, the artist downstairs, is little more than a clich&eacute;, although Djimon Hounsou plays him well. After I had thought about the film for a few hours, I began to realize that the story is more contrived than I had originally noticed. Mateo is far from being the only clich&eacute;, and living in destitution doesn't provide opportunities for emotional epiphanies. It is, in fact, very dangerous, exhausting, and depressing. But as I counted \\"In America\\"'s contrivances and preposterous elements, I was also struck by the fact that I wasn't inclined to think about them as I was watching the movie. That's because \\"In America\\"'s dreamlike quality and its engaging performances overcome its lapses in credibility. I don't know that this film is supposed to be literally believable. The family's emotional journey is poignant and rings of truth. The details are a little fantastic. But it is told through the memories of a child, which may partly explain its uneven realism. Memory is highly subjective, in any case; its only what one person noticed and clung to. I recommend \\"In America\\" for its fine performances and its unique and slightly fanciful perspective.little more than a cliché, although Djimon Hounsou plays him well.

B00005JMFR|4.0|The first Matrix was a well thought out and unique piece of science fiction but things kind of went down in Reloaded.  Revolutions is a surprising film in the fact that it's more interesting than the overrated Reloaded but fails to reach the standards the first Matrix set.  I'm not saying it's a bad movie, I'm just saying that it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  The highlight of the third film, just like the second film, is Hugo Weaving who plays Agent Smith.  Not since Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs has a villian been so much fun to watch.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears was my all time favorite singer! I just got her album on Christmas, and it came along with Hilary Duff's CD. Hilary Duff's CD is great, but when i listened to Britney Spears &quot;In the zone,&quot; she totally changed! She used to be a teeny bopper, now she' much older and wiser! I really love &quot;Me against the music,&quot; &quot;Boom boom,&quot; and &quot;Breathe on me&quot; you'll think it's really Kylie Minouge but it's still Britney. And &quot;Everytime&quot; is a GREAT ballad. All the rest of the songs on the album are great too, but the 4 songs I just listed are the best! The reason why I gave this album 4 stars was because I have Britney Spear's other albums and they're all teeny bopper music, but now, it's all transformed like she quit all her other songs and changed her singing voice and songs, but this album was REAL COOL! It's worth buying it, and all Britney haters out there, your just wannabes and think your all that, and your just jealous because Britney can dance much better and probably is much prettier than you, but you wouldn't go harsh on her that much because you know you like her album!Hope my reveiw helped. Thanks for reading it!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is no doubt one of the best movies of it's time, with in your face action and awsome special effects you could and will want to watch it over and over again.   <BR>        Unless you have been living under a rock you would know the general premise  of it so there isnt any need for me to say it. Exept for the fact that it blows you away every time you watch it with new hidden meanings and forshadowing, which I would watch it just for.<BR>         Anyway lets talk about the acting.  Keanu Reeves { Neo} acually did a great job.  Now before you just skip over this reveiw because you think im being overly enthusiastic just read for one more second..... People critize him for being &quot; wooden&quot; and not showing much emotion, and that he doesn't seem like anything special { which I TOTALLY disagree with, but thats besides the point} well thats why why he is soooo PERFECT for this role, he is suposed to look confussed and guarded during the film, which is why i give the casting so much credit, as well as Keanu  because lets face it, could you see brad pitt or will smith now as Neo?  So I really believe he deserves more credit then what fans and critics have given him.<BR>                       Anyway where was I, Lawrence Fishbourrne, he was great in the part of Morph. He was very confident,  in a good way, but he was also able to put lots of emotion into the easily dense part of &quot;the captain&quot;.<br />     Finally we come to the runaway hit of the matrix....... Carrie Anne Moss.  She was beautiful, strong, kick ass, emotional, simply wonderful.  Every time I watch it I'm blown away by the presence she has, it's not a big over blown one, just you always want her on the screen { and not just because she is beautiful}.  By the way, if you liked her in this you should definatly check her out in Memento, which is my second favorite movie behind  this.<BR>    So basically what im saying is Screw lord of the rings, buy the MATRIX and of couse it's sequelsbut thats for another  review.
0385504209|1.0|I have just finished \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  What an utter waste of time!  Dan Brown adds nothing to the murder mystery genre with this book.  Furthermore, the entire premise is implausible as the key element of the mystery, the \\"Priory of Sion\\" and its guardianship of the Holy Grail has been proven to be a complete hoax.  Mr. Brown's biblical scholarship is shoddy, his analyses of the artworks of Leonardo are facile and, of course, he provides no motive for the secret, which has been kept for so long, to be kept.  I am truly amazed that this book has received as much attention as it has.  I am sorry to say that I wasted my money on this book.  A much better read would be Umberto Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" or \\"Badolino\\".
B000002OX5|4.0|Ah 1967! Melodies, harmonies galore, soaring prsychedelic imagery with enough pop to keep the teenyboppers happy. Even those venerable purveyors of British-r'n'b - The 'oo - couldn't resist digging into the garden of flower-power during that fateful year and unearthing this sublimely silly ode to pirate radio.<BR>This is the band's &quot;summer of love&quot; album, spiced with satire and Goonish humour (check out the title and album art for starters), especially in the inspired deodorant ad &quot;Odorono&quot;, and &quot;Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Mary Ann With the Shaky Hand&quot; and &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;, among others. All brilliantly remixed for the reissue as well.<br />Note: The expanded edition disproves the urban myth that the band ran out of time and/or energy on &quot;side two&quot; of the original l.p. The band had recorded several jingles not originally included, but as they wanted to release a single-disc l.p. to save time &amp; money, these extra tracks were left off.
B00004STUL|4.0|The other critics on this page have to be total IDIOTS/GEEKS!!! &quot;Bad Boys&quot; is a great movie for everyone to watch. Although, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are/were comedians, they did an excellent job in the movie. The chemistry that the two shared made the movie even better. The sequel to the movie is even better than the first.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Okay. . . Number one for those of you who claim to be E.B's biggest fan how could you not appreciate this album. I admit that when I went to buy it and noticed that there were not as many tracks as usual I was taken aback but me being the big fan that I am I was ready for whatever she was going to put out there. If yo are her biggest fan then you would understand where she is coming from with this album. &quot;Neo-soul is dead and freakquency is born&quot;. She's taken it to a different level that only some would understand, like my man Andre 3000 from outkast (his LOVE BELOW CD). If you knew these artist well you would know that this is where their music ingenius lay but it's hard to make it to the top starting out with music like this, you have to build up respect first, this is what she wanted to get out to the world but knew she had to get to a certain level first (try reading the CD insert, it's there for a reason). I think the LP is genius, it shows there is more to music then creating a beat on a mixer and throwin &quot;get low&quot; or &quot;shake your a$$&quot; in it to get the attention. It just goes to show you how much the world has been brainwashed into thinking that everything on the top 20 charts is music. While the top sellers get rich or die trying to spit there ill lived cliches to get air play 24 times in an hour on the radio until the listener becomes infected by their musical disease then they're hooked. Give the LP a second chance and really try to understand it. It will give you a greater appreciation for music itself along with a new outlook on life. Celebrate the birth of FREAKQUENCY and become non-adapted!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|When Iwent to the movies to see this film I was very exited, and when I walked out I was even more exited to buy it on dvd.  People get all uptight about &quot;Having&quot; to know what the whole movie means...  just enjoy this very enjoyable movie!<br /> The Special effects and the action will be what relaoded is known  for but i believe there is much more then that, and I dont mean just all of the biblical  and the philogical stuff ( though that was there and well done}.  It is also kind of a love theme in it as well.  <br />Ok i know it sounds corny but when I watched it for about the third time it was really clear that the biggest theme is love. Between both neo and trinity, morpheus and niobe,  link and zee.  So i think this movie was not fully understood because it was clear to me that the bros. want this movie to be totally labeled as a action flick or sci fi. Oh well....<br />  I also found while talking to people about it they were really confused (which is understandable} but its an obvios thing if u dont understand it u wont like it,<br />So if u dont get it, either buy the dvd and enjoy the special effects while u try to get it, or ask someone and then buy it. Dont just complain about how complicated it is because that is the point! its supposed to challenge u which is cool because u dont get that in  many movies today!!!
B00005JMCT|3.0|The final end to the American Pie saga.  I saw this movie after hearing great reviews from the critics and was expecting it to be the best one of them all.  I was undoubtfully wrong.  There are alot of problems with this movie that the others didn't have.  It seemed in this one the creators were trying way too hard for some cheap laughs than in the other ones where the awkward and surprising situations the characters got themselves into were the funniest.  Every character hits the mark right on in this one, except for Sean Williams Scott.  It came as a shock to me because like many others, Stifler is my favorite and most rememorable character.  But in this movie, Mr. Scott is completely overacting and Stifler therefore seems way to over the top.  So over the top that it makes you not want to watch him, more less care about him.  There are some few funny scenes in the movie.  The most funniest are of course the most outrageous.  But between those parts it is undeniably slow.  For instance, Stifler mistakingly enters a gay bar and shows off his dancing moves.  It wasn't funny at all and seemed like a scene that should be obviously deleted to the cutting room floor and never seen again.  It's that type of humor that seems so forced that makes the movie at some points a pain to sit through.  But the movie does end on a good note to one of the most famous \\"American Teen\\" comedies of this time.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|what in the world's happened to DT? First of all I don't own the previous 6DOIT, I've never even listened to it so I wouldn't be able to talk about the progress. what I can say is that this is by far the worst DT album I have yet listened to.<BR>Uninspired is the word. These songs don't only all sound alike they also sound like a dozen other bands (Metallica for the most, but also KORN (seriously), and even Linkin Park (the rapping parts in As I Am)).<BR>this is not the Dream Theater I have fallen in love with. I am a musical person and I love inventiveness, creativity etc in music. when I heard SFAM and IAW for the first time I was totally startled by the musical wit and talent the band has.<BR>but this is just a bunch of very, yes nu-metal-style low chords and cheesy lyrics. no kidding. I hope there will be better times for these guys and until then I'd rather recommend real progrock like yes, pink floyd or just the older DT stuff.<br />-3 stars still cause it's DT

B000003TA4|5.0|The CD that defined a generation.  The band that changed the face of music forever.  The rock album of ages.  Nirvana's masterpiece still remains the best rock CD of all time in my opinion.  From Kurt Cobain's heart-wrenching wails on Smells Like Teen Spirit to the dark yet beautiful Polly, this LP has it all.  It spans several musical genres: grunge, alternative rock, punk, etc.  That was one of the great things about the spectacle called Nirvana.  The could be upbeat and insightful on an acoustic piece, then switch to a head-banging punk killer, and wrap it up with a song so dark and powerful you'd question why Kurt didn't put a shotgun to his mouth sooner.  (RIP man)<BR> Fans of 1990's rock will not be disappointed by this album.  This is one of those CD's that stays in your rotation constantly.  I can't see this CD EVER getting old.  People that put down this album are usually radio-friendlies that have no taste for real rock music.  Over-rated??  Psh, NO!  5 out of 5 stars.... <BR> If you're a NIRVANA fan, make sure to check out In Utero and Unplugged in NY too.

B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin's \\"II\\" must go down as one of the most influential rock albums of the 20th century. It helped create heavy metal and generate hard rock. It is an amazing album, full of classic guitar riffs and great rock and roll as well as some blues and jazz across the nine tracks. Here is my review of each song:<br />1. Whole Lotta Love - 5/5 - A great start to the album. Contains a classic guitar riff from Jimmy Page and good vocals from Robert Plant. Becomes rather unusual with Page playing his guitar with a violin bow and John Bonham striking random cymbals, as well as Plant's drifting vocals - \\"Ah, ah, ah, ah\\". Eventually starts up again, hitting a climax. Bonham then does plenty of drum fills to see the song out.<BR>2. What Is and What Should Never Be - 4/5 - Starts off slowly with Plant's voice sounding peaceful, although strange, and a quiet guitar and bass. Becomes slightly louder in the chorus. Mid-way through comes a nice, drifting guitar solo from Page. Later takes off in a different direction with Page's guitar moving from speaker to speaker and the song moving at a faster pace. A good song.<BR>3. Lemon Song - 4½/5 - Contains another classic guitar riff from Page, some solid drumming from Bonham and...well, understandable lyrics from Plant. The song picks up speed with a mad sounding solo from Page, which helps the song along. Mid-way through comes bassist John Paul Jones' peaceful, non-distorted inprovisation, lasting a couple of minutes. The song then unexpectedly picks up speed again before finishing with an echo. A very good song.<BR>4. Thank You - 3½/5 - A break from the madness of the likes of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Lemon Song\\". Quite a beautiful song with acoustic guitar and a Hammond C3 organ, which makes a very light, touching sound. Some beautiful lyrics from Plant as well, eg. \\"Inspiration's all you are to me\\". However, overall, I think the faster songs are slightly preferable.<BR>5. Heartbreaker - 5/5 - Contains another classic guitar rifffrom Page and bold lyrics from Page, which both shatter \\"Thank You\\". Page takes off mid-way through with an incredible solo, which gets faster and faster. Then all the instruments start up again, going faster than in the first half of the song, and the song reaches a climax with steady, confident drumming from Bonham. However, the abrupt ending is rather disappointing.<BR>6. Living Loving Maid - 5/5 - Yet another classic song, containing yet another classic guitar riff from Page. The chorus is very good, and descends towards the end. Good, although brief, solo from Page mid-way through. The only problem with this song is that it is too short, coming in at only 2:40, compared to the others which are all over four minutes. However, it is still very good.<BR>7. Ramble On - 4/5 - Another partly acoustic song which starts off peacefully with some sort of slapping noise in the background. Plant's vocals are also serene, but become a bit louder in the chorus, which includes good bass work from Jones. The problem with this song is its lack of development - it remains similar all the way through. However, it is still pretty good.<BR>8. Moby Dick - 5/5 - A great instrumental featuring Bonham's big moment. Starts off with another classic guitar and, this time, bass riff along with Bonham's drumming. However, after a minute, the guitar and bass stop, and Bonham launches into a huge, 3-minute long drum solo, showing his amazing talents behind the kit. Reaches a climax mid-way through with the drumming going extremely fast. Eventually, the guitar and bass starts up again, and the song ends with a bang.<BR>9. Bring It On Home - 5/5 - A great conclusion to this great album. Starts off fairly slow with a nice, peaceful guitar riff from Page and Plant's quiet, strange sounding vocals, as well as bursts of harmonica. After a couple of minutes, the guitar picks up a different, electric-bluesy riff, Bonham's drums enter and the song moves faster. Contains another good solo from Page. At the end, the song returns to the peacefulness of the first half, and Plant's harmonica gets the last word.<br />Overall, \\"II\\" is a classic rock album from Led Zeppelin. It is easy to see how it influenced many others. I highly recommend this masterpiece.
B00005QZWJ|4.0|A must have for all LOTR fans. Brilliant composing by Howard Shore and great additions by Enya. I have seen FOTR 16 times, and have it memorized. Therefore, the soundtrack is a great way to bring back those great memorys. Some songs are ghostly sinister and get your heart racing while other are very calm, and emotional. I was not a fan of classical music, but I am now. Any fan of the movie or even of classical music should get this one. The price is more than your average cd, but hey, this is not your average cd.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album is a piviotal point in musical history as it is the first psychedelic album.  However though, what most people don't understand it is the first and only Black & White Psychedelic Album as the album expiriments with timing, rythems, and of course beats, even parading its own trade mark beat invented by Pete Best which gave them the name The Beatles.  A good example of this is \\"tomorow never knows\\" where the drum starts off with the typical trade mark beat and then stumbles and trips catching it's balance in another timing and rythem.  The album also introduces the sitar to Rock & Roll expiramenting with semi tones and micro tones, opening the door for indian music and culture derived from the high astral plane, which is what the Hippies of the sixties were trying to achive through L.S.D. in the late sixties.  In fact this album was released much ealier, and recorded ealier than that, and was influenced ealier than even that as John and George attended an L.S.D. party in the early sixties hosted by George Harrisons dentist.  This is when the drug was only available to the upper crust beatnick bohiem.  The mod wealthy bored thinkers of the professional world, would scam the stuff from psychaitrist by perscription so they could  throw small private swoires with thier groovy artist friends and get into the minds of great thinkers.  This went on until a psychiatrist  by the name of Timothy Leary decided to turn it on to the American teenager after he missed the bus with Ken Keasy due to arrogance. (Thus makeing the drug Illegal)  By this time everyone was getting into the psyedelic phase using diferent instruments and mixes to achive colorful sounds.  Actually it was the Beatles who led the way with this too, with Sgt. Pepper a very colorful album and album art.  However it all started with \\"Revolver\\" altering states of time, which ended up being the foundation for color.  In fact George Harrison has never recived the credit he deserves with his vision of the future of music.  Again another example is \\"Taxman\\" which is probably the first Punk Song ever recorded using Punk Lyrics And Punk Cords and Punk Tunning and muting, twenty years before it's time.  That's tweny years of conciousness founding by the quiet Beatle starting with this album.  A pivotal point in history as well as musical history... A must for any music collection of any kind.

B0000VAFO0|1.0|I had walked into the movie theatre (when the film was originally released) and had only hopes for teriffic-looking costumes.<BR>The story is not unoriginal, but rather it is unintentional drivel.  It does not contain a solid style, nor does it contain fluidity.<br />The story (promised by the commercials) is about a Romeo and Juliet-like vampire and warewolf flick, but the delivery simply had vampires who hunt warewolfs (and vice versa).<BR>The vampires were very boring and looked bored.  They all just sat around a loung, inside a fancy Victorian-age mansion and were wearing clothing suitable for the victorian age (with the exceptional trench coat and leather jacket.  I would have liked seeing the outfits if only the film did not cut away from that scene after two seconds.<br />The warewolves live underground and constantly beat eachother up.  I did not bother asking for a reason.<br />Somewhere in the film's \\"plot\\" is a conspiracy that dates a few thousand years back and makes the vampires look like bad guys.  How can you choose sides between vampires who carry a reflection in the mirror and DO NOT drink blood (throughout the entire film) and warewolves and beat up the vampires as if they were mere humans?<br />To sum up my review (and you may notice that I did not give away the plot, but simply something of the \\"story\\") there is only one vampire in the film.  He is a ressurected elder who sucks blood, weilds a sword, dresses appropriately, takes initiative, and has, get this: super human strength!<br />This was a horrid film, and to top it off it was actually LACKING style, predictable, and boring.<br />P.S.<BR>Why would vampires fire pistols (automatic ones at that) when they can move quicker than the eye can see?
B00000JLWW|4.0|The last time I reviewed the film, I gave the first half pretty dismal comments while overtly praising the last half. After re-watching the film, the first half is rather slow although does have it's good points while the last half is probably some of the most thrilling and goosebump-inducing moments captured on celluloid.    The massive ship Titanic set sail on the week of April 10th, 1912. It left Southampton and made it's way to New York. It was the maiden voyage for the ocean liner and the press was marvelling at her size, so to give them something new to print, the owner ordered it to go faster so they can marvel her speed. Unfortunately, that left little time to dodge an iceberg that sideswiped the ship below the waterline causing the ship to flood from the inside. It plunged head first into the water and started to sink for 2 hours and 40 minutes until the ship split in 2 and sank to the ocean floor.    The story centers on Jack, a free travelling artist, who ends up falling in love with Rose, a woman who's marrying the son of a steel tycoon, only she doesn't really love him and he's quite the controlling type. They enjoy the time together but they can't be together can't cause she's engaged and he's a poor guy. So they get caught up in the collision and have to survive long enough.    The first half is noteworthy to me for it's set design. It looks remarkable with a lot of attention to detail as well as the aerial shots of the ship which James Cameron said to CG artists to act like you were advertising the Titanic for commercials. The costumes are quite great also.     Almost an hour and 40 minutes passes until the lockouts notices the iceberg and the crew scramble to go around it. They were too late as the ship ends up scraping the iceberg in a nice action scene and then pretty much not a lot of action only neat effects. The film, thanks to great sound, as a lot of goosebump moments like their run away from the water in the corridor or when the ceiling gives way to the water.    Then the big moment itself: when the ship can't handle the pressure and it splits in half and eventually sinks. It's a great use of effects, minatures and live action and certainly looks impressive even on repeated viewings. One odd thing though is that sometimes the scenes look really odd, like when the ship is floating vertical, look at the hairlines and faces, they look weird against the backdrop, or they look obvious blue screen.    Another compliment is James Horner's score. It has that right amount of energy and action with more character and soft overtones. The main theme that you hear during the opening is quite nice too although my favorite is at the end when the camera travels underwater back to the ship. Vocalist Sissel has a nice ethereal quality to her voice that makes it almost haunting. And of course we've all heard the song, yes the SONG THE SONG! UGH! But anyways.    It's funny that James Cameron had a big run in the 1980's and early 1990's with Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies and this, then there's practically no new film. Known for being quite the perfectionist on set, he can make a good thrilling film and blend of comedy and character development. Love this film or hate it, it's still quite a marvel to look at.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Definately one of the best I've seen.  The sound and picture quality are amazing, and the energy from the show is felt while watching this.  I've been a Peppers fan since Lollapalooza 1992, and I highly recommend this item to all fans.  Most of the songs performed are from the Californication and By the Way CDs.  A high point for me on this DVD is the performance of Venice Queen, as most of the other songs I had seen them do live when they were in town here.  Anthony and John really blow me away on that number as performed on this DVD.  I love watching these guys; it's obvious that they are enjoying themselves as much as the rest of us.  Really, get ths one; you won't be disappointed.

B0000CABBW|5.0|This film is captivating on a soul level.  The haunting soundtrack, and the cinematography, along with the incredible acting just took my breath away!  This is one of my favorite movies ever!
078324228X|5.0|Though no offence you shouldnt have come out so aggresively against &quot; A viewer&quot;. Though I can fell your anger as a dedicated fan of Rubin Carter. I did visit that graphic witness site and at first it seemed as though Rubin was wrong. Then I read Big Talka's angry review and thought hang on he could be right. So I visited other sites that supported Rubin and found out there is more evidence FOR Rubin then against. Though the case is still a very hard one. Besides that little argument between big talka and a viewer lets get back to the actual movie. One thing is for sure, whether you support Rubin or not the movie is in actual fact not actually real. ALthough Denzel doez superbly and the production is wonderful.

6305971145|5.0|Unlike the formal review above; this movie is one of the best for families; UNLIKE many now which seem to have some &quot;body function&quot; humor. Aside note: This Santa costume is the best ever of any Santa you have ever seen... Dudley is charming. This movie is in my collection ALONG side It's A Wonderful Life, Christmas Carol (with George C. Scott), Miracle on 34th Street (Natalie Woods) with the greats. This movie is 5 stars, just below the afor mentioned movies, but it is well worth having in YOUR collection of CHRISTMAS GREATS.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is one of the best ever written.  I still cannot believe it was cancelled.  I would recommend this dvd set for anyone who enjoys shows that deal with relationships.  Also, it is great for sci fi fans!!
B00003CXS4|5.0|Most movies that come out today would be more directed to the MTV brainless maggots. Not the case with Snatch. It's a comedy but you need to watch it more than once to understand it. It is a smart movie that stands out from the other crappy movies like The Fast and The Furious(Sorry, I just needed to make the comparison. I know they are different). The characters that are introduced are all part of the same story but some never even meet. It's all because of one little stone that is shown in the beginning. Another great thing: NO LOVE STORY! Buy this movie!
0316666343|5.0|I finished this book a mere ten minutes ago and felt it absolutely necessary to make others aware of this incredible novel.  Not since A Prayer for Owen Meany have I been so moved by any book.  I had it sitting on my shelf collecting dust for a couple months before I got it out and started reading yesterday, and I am SO glad that I did.  <BR>The Lovely Bones is so beautifully written and each page is so compelling that I found it nearly impossible to put it down each time I was interrupted.  It really made me think about the small things in life that we all take for granted, many of those things that Susie Salmon was unable to experience.  She watches her younger sister grow up, and I couldn't help but crying thinking of how unfair it was that Susie never got to do all the things her sister did.  <BR>Unfortunately, I do not have Alice Sebold's flare for words, so I'm unable to adequately express how incredible I think this book is.  My eyes are still puffy and my nose still stuffy from all the crying I did reading the last third of the book....
B0000C6E4D|2.0|As a borderline-obsessive Sarah McLachlan fan, I was thrilled when I got news that she had put out an album after a five year absence from the industry (besides some work on soundtracks).  But upon listening to the album, I was nothing but disappointed.  Fallen and a couple of other songs have catchy tunes, but the lyrics are nothing compared to her past work.  Compare the lyrics from any song on Afterglow to songs off Surfacing, Fumbling or either of her two early albums (Touch, Solace) and you'll see what I mean.  The songs in Afterglow lack the subtlety and imagery that made her past work so brilliant and captivating.  Furthermore, her voice does not get the attention it deserves in the album, just about caged by the instrumental parts in the songs.  If one is looking for some catchy soft pop, Afterglow is not a bad place to go.  But for deeper music that can one can actually identify with, Sarah's earlier stuff is unparalleled.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Well, well, here comes the pretentious, \\"philosophical,\\" turkey of the year! Let's go over Reloaded point-by-point.<br />  First of all, there's Keanu Reeves. I never thought of him as a very good actor before, but he really showed his worst side in this film. He shows about as much emotion as a chunk of sheet metal. I'm surprised Trinity didn't ask him several times whether he actually loved her or not. Every time he comes on, you feel like walking up to him and saying \\"hey, Neo, could I give you a little injection of charisma?\\" Admittedly, he did look fine in his black suit and sunglasses. But that was really all he was--a black suit and sunglasses, filled with a little sawdust. He might as well have been holding the script in front of his face, reading it off to the audience.<br />  Carrie-Ann Moss did little better. Pointing a gun at Merovingian's wife because she wanted to kiss Neo? Certainly, I think Persephone was being stupid herself, but saying that Trinity's move was an overreaction is an understatement. She gave Keanu about as much as she received--dry acting, and that terrible flat voice that sounds like a computer-generated recording.<br />  OK, Laurence Fishburne did all right...but he did not compare with his rather good performance in the original Matrix movie. His speech in Zion was unconvincing for me--and I didn't particularly like his open, sleeveless shirt.<br />  And then there's Hugo Weaving, probably the movie's one saving grace. The Wachowski brothers don't give him nearly enough screen time, however, and he has little opportunity to show how well he can really act.<br />  And then the orgy and the sex scene--which I did NOT watch, by the way, being a Bible-believing Christian; my family just skipped those two scenes--are completely out of place and unnecessary. And whether they would have made sense in the plot, they are sinful and should never be imitated on the movie screen, let alone be done in reality.<br />  The fight scenes could have been good--they were certainly visually impressive. But in almost every one of them, the motion is slowed down to almost a stop for a few seconds. Apparently the Wachowski brothers were trying to make some sort of an impressive effect with this, but I thought it merely detracted from the quick pace of the scenes.<br />  The philosophy in this movie is an absolute joke. It appears to be an insane mix of several religions, and a dash of Wachowski weirdness. Most of it is meaningless, let alone dumb, and leads nowhere.<br />  The highway chase scene was so-so, but it did not have me feeling almost as if I was on Trinity's motorcycle, weaving in and out of the semis, as a good action scene should. I felt somewhat detatched watching it. The twins--albino, Rastafarian type fellows with white suits--were sort of funny, but once again they got hardly any screen time, and almost zero opportunity to act.<br />  The plot itself was so-so, and maybe in the hands of better and more moral directors and some OK actors (even mediocre would be better!) it would have been a decent movie. As it was, however, it was not good at all.<br />  Well, that was quite a rant, but I think overall this movie deserves it. The first movie had promise, but Reloaded shoots that out of the sky. I will see The Matrix Revolutions, the third and last installment, but not in the theaters and only to see what happens--and see if the Wackowski brothers salvage this failing trilogy.s could have been good--they were certainly visually impressive.

B000089RVX|5.0|&quot;Fallen&quot; is Evanescence's debut album.  Its unique quality of hardcore rock blended with opera and celtic is rarely accomplished.  They did it.  Their performance and writing talents on this album answer why they received five Grammy nominations for 2003: Best Hard Rock Performance, Best Rock Song (both &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;), Best Rock Album, Best New Artist, and Album of the Year.  They prove on every track that they are true, serious musicians, not fake artists in the spotlight only for the money.<br />Amy Lee's lead vocals are breathtaking.  She is one of the few rockers that can sing at such level.  Her operatic and spiritual tone blends perfectly with the edgy, yet calming music.  Ben Moody's guitar work and Lee's songwriting partnering offer a further mind-altering experience to the audience.  His album performance digs deeper into the band's rauchy side.  Their songwriting partnership will take them to many horizons as artists within the next many years.  Their chemistry is perfect as heard on the album.  Evanescence's heart and soul is clearly present in every track, fast song or ballad.<br />Evanescence's musical and genre range is rare.  Their hit single &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; proves this the most with guest vocalist Phil McCoy of 12 Stones.  His aggressive rapping and screaming fits perfectly with the theme.  Their ballads &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; offer a one-on-one vibe with Lee's vocals accompanied with only the piano and the orchestra.  All other tracks offer their own different mind-altering vibe levels.<br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is the perfect album for those looking for rockers with talent.  It appeals to many groups of people.  This will surely keep listeners entertained for a long time.  There is no disappointing note heard in this album.
0441003257|5.0|After reading Gaiman's &quot;American Gods,&quot; I went on a buying spree and picked up a bunch of his books, and this is the first of them I've had time to read. It's definitely amusing (I love a good apocalypse story), chock-full of sly, British humor. The authors try to be Douglas Adams, and they occasionally fail, but usually they succeed. The book didn't have me in stitches the way &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; did, but it was definitely good for a laugh (and a bit of theological pondering). The characters are great, the writing is top-notch--definitely worth reading of you like Pratchett, Gaiman, comedy, Christian fictions, or just books in general.
B0000C1733|3.0|Most of the songs on this CD are excellent and the Peppers put their huge hits on this CD. There are clearly some great songs missing on this CD. However I believe that the Chili Peppers should have instead of this CD made a CD entitled:<BR>Red Hot Chili Peppers: Greatest Hits 1991-2003, since they already have What Hits out that covers their 80s stuff (and Under The Bridge).<BR>I would include 18 songs on this CD, including the 2 new ones.<BR>It would go something like this:<BR>1. Under The Bridge<BR>2. Give It Away<BR>3. Scar Tissue<BR>4. By The Way<BR>5. Aeroplane<BR>6. Soul To Squeeze<BR>7. Otherside<BR>8. Can't Stop<BR>9. Suck My Kiss<BR>10. Love Rollercoaster<BR>11.

Save The Population<br />I believe these are the Greatest Hits from 1991-2003 for RHCP. Of course, they have so many amazing songs it's hard to create the perfect greatest hits album.<BR>As for the one they have out, it's missing some but it does cover their best.

B000065U1N|1.0|There can only be one reason why someone would make a movie such as this one - to shock people and gross them out. I was surprised for about half of the movie as I had heard that it was supposed to be really violent. Honestly, the action was tame with people falling down when shot just like in teh old cowboy films...then suddenly it just got completely disgusting with arms flying around and blood everywhere. And the makeshift operation - was it really necessary to show that so vividly, I ask myself? Yes, they did their job well - I was grossed out, but I can't say I found it very entertaining. In fact, I would be worried about people who do find this sort of thing to be entertainment!<BR>There is virtually no story in the movie apart from people shooting at other people who are shooting. Of course, there is a reason why the soldiers were in Somalia, but the reasons and political situation are glossed over and merely referenced in writing, in passing. One soldier got captured, but we don't see his rescue or release. We are merely told about it in writing at the end of the film. I am sure so much more could have been done with this movie, but then again, if you want to makea movie that makes big bucks, you have to pander to some of the basest desires of humankind - They want to see blood and guts, so the film makers give it 'em, regardless of the effect such a facile portrayal of brutality has on societies today.
0142000663|5.0|I can remember the brown clouds rising up and sweeping over our home, even in Oklahoma City in the early 1950's. And the stories from my parents and grandparents who stayed in Oklahoma through the depression, and the stories from my grandmother who moved to California looking for work, but it wasn't until 1967 when I was in the Navy in San Diego situations would inspire me to read this book.<br />Even today in California, being called an &quot;Okie&quot; is not a compliment. It is said with a derogatory note of disdain akin to so many other predjudicial nicknames, and you really don't feel the entire impact unless one is directed at you.<br />What was this about? Why was there such an attitude towards people from Oklahoma? A friend told me I would find the answers in this book. It was in reading this book I lost my naivete about the depth of human prejudice and callousness. It was this book that inspired me to participate in civil rights demonstrations when the Navy transfered me to Mississipi. It was this book that woke me up!<br />I will always be grateful to Steinbeck for the skill to tell a story such as this, and I can only hope it's message will endure through all time.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Is SEABISCUIT a great movie? Probably not, but I like it a lot and think it's pretty darn good. It's a classic story of some underdogs whose ability and determination ultimately shine through, and the beauty of this story is that it is essentially true. I haven't read the book, nor do I know enough about Seabiscuit to know where reality ends and storytelling takes over, but the basic story can't be denied.<br />As presented, not only is Seabiscuit an underdog (mistreated as a young horse because he didn't fit the mold of a classic racehorse), but so are the three major human characters. One professional reviewer whose comments I saw regarding this movie complained that it was more about the human characters than the horse. Duh! It would be hard to make a movie just about a horse. Horses can't handle much dialogue (Mr. Ed aside) and aren't great actors. What's nice here is that horse, jockey, trainer and owner all carry each other and achieve greatness together. None of them could have done it without the others.<br />SEABISCUIT, playing on the fact that it is based on a true story, takes on a semi-documentary nature. Newsreel-like breaks are interspersed throughout the film. That's fine with me and it gave the film a more true-life, historical feel. The acting is fine. Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper and Tobey Maguire are good in their roles and William H. Macy gives a great performance in a limited role as a radio personality. Further, some of the cinimatography is excellent. Catching the interplay among jockeys in the midst of a race is impresively done. And, of course, the horses are simply gorgeous.<br />This is a very good film. At least, I thought so. It may seem a little slow at times, but all of the personal episodes play into the nature of the characters. It's a heart-warming story made more so because it's true, and the production values are outstanding. With many movies featuring heavy doses of violence and special effects, SEABISCUIT represents a nice change of pace. Again, it's not a GREAT movie -- I'll still take THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies -- but it's good. I enjoyed it in the theater, I've got the DVD, and I recommend it.of pace.

I know everyone has sumthin to say to me so im gonna give you the opprotunity: homefry3007@yahoo.com
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|I am very dissapointed in this cd. The songs seem repetitive and not as full as Mer De Noms. Mer De Noms just has so much more atmosphere. Maynard tried too hard to come up with deep lyrics but only ends up sounding corny on almost every track.  His singing is also pretty weak. &quot;Help me if you can...&quot; &quot;Help me understand...&quot; Never heard such deep lyrics in my life. There is no comparison between the lyrics as Mer De Noms which sound totally original while these seem more like they were written to attract whiny goth kids. This cd reminds me of how great of a record Mer De Noms is.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido is back for good.<br />After a somewhat long absence from the music scene,Dido is back with ,I must admit, a better comeback than I could have ever imagined.<br />We all learned about this girl with the melacholic voice in Eminem's hit single &quot;Stan&quot;, and most of us were surprised yet satisfied that an actually talented girl found her way to the top.<br />Her last album sold 12 million copies worlwide.That alone says everything!!<br />In her new album, Dido is going down the same road that she did in her previous. Trip-hop mixed with ballads, lounge mixed with pure pop, are some of the outcomes of &quot;Dido-blender&quot;.And theu are A W S O M E.<BR>Songs like &quot;Stoned&quot;, &quot;Mary's In India&quot;,&quot;Who Makes You Feel&quot; are some of the best in her Cd,although it would be unfair to not admit that all the songs are great.<br />If you liked her first CD, don't sit,go and get it<BR>If you didn't... get her new one anyway, you surely won't regret it!!!!<br />Enjoy!<BR>Peace<BR>xxxx
B0000D96NW|5.0|Ok, before I start this review, I want to make a few points perfectly clear...  I have been a fan of Machine Head from the very start, Burn my Eyes was the best thing since the invention of the wheel as was the more things change... I was one of the angst filled 16 year olds in the crowd of smokey venues that were no bigger than most basements, getting my arse beat in the mosh pit and possibly suffering some degree of hearing loss.  I think you get the picture...  So , like many fans of Machine head, the follow up albums were met with a slight air of dissapointment ...not because they were bad, but because we all knew Rob and the boys were capable of so much more.... So here is my review of Through the ashes of empires  ....  GO GET THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!  If you are a fan of Machine Head or just a metal fan in general, this will unlock more inside you than most people are capable of feeling at all.  By far the most intense album I have heard in years, I have even thought of building a padded room just so I can listen to it safely.  Lyrically, musically, emotionally and atmospherically Machine Heads' best work to date.  When it comes to music, most people are loyally tied to the album that turned them on to a band, for me, Through the ashes of empires has taken Burn my eyes off of the pedestal.  In a world crowded with \\"numetal\\" clichs and acts, Machine Head has proven that real metal still exists.  So if you are still reading this.....  it may mean that you have not made the decision to get this cd yet.... What the #*#* is wrong with you!!!!????  Get it now!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Glad I at least have this DVD collection.  I LOVED this show- so well written, witty, and with REAL character conflict!  I loved Enterprise, but as soon as I say Firefly I saw what a REAL SFdrama could be about... Enterprise is just pitiful compared to this...
B0000C6E4D|5.0|First time I listen to Sarah, and I have to admit I really enjoyed listening to Afterglow. Great CD!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I was farely satisfied with Britney's new album. I only bough her first CD and i decided to buy this cd, thinking she was recovering from the planecrasher &quot;Britney&quot;. I was wrong, Its a little better then 2001 &quot;Brittney&quot;. I do like &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; - The best song on the album, &quot;Shadow&quot; &quot;Everytime&quot; &quot;Toxic&quot;, I think Christiana's New album Stripped is alot better because she is really the one maturing. These songs are almost the same as the one's on her first 3 cds. Just more ... Dance in them. Im waiting for you to grow up britney and really take a stab at being a adult.
B00005QCVY|5.0|If you're one of the 8 people in this country who have yet to see this film, lucky you.  When asked by (insert date, relative, friend, random person) what my favorite moview is, I'll often rank this in my top 5.<br />Now, keep in mind, this film is 2/3rds of a century old.  Much of the dogmatic, religious, and sexist cultural norms have been largely outgrown and it's advisable that you watch this in the context of the period it was made (don't you dare watch the colorized version).<br />This movie speaks loudly about the significance one mans personal contribution to the welfare and quality of life of those around him/her.  It reminds us that we're all tightly connected to each other and that \\"doing good\\" tends to compound and become easier when practiced as a personal philosophy.<br />A wonderful holiday movie.<br />Enjoy.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|these punk are ripping off The White Stripes, who is by far the best revival group out there, alongside The Strokes. when i heard the radio single, i was pissed, because it sounded exactly like &quot;Screwdriver&quot; by The White Stripes and they were copycatting Jack White's lyrical style. don't buy this s***, buy &quot;Elephant&quot; instead!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Depending on where you are in your life, depends in how this movie will sit inside you.  This movie can be used to prevent drug abuse if you introduce the movie to a child at an appropriate age and at the parent's discresion.  If you are at the &quot;expirementing&quot; stage of you life, you will see how &quot;harmless&quot; one puff, snort, etc. really isn't.  It may only be pot, however it can lead into other drugs or certain types of people you may not wan to be associated with.  If you do not fall under these catagories, you are probably thankfull.  You do not need to be doing drugs, or have done drugs to be moved by this movie.  It will leave the most ignorant person walking away with jitters, and withdrawl symptoms.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I expected a good followup from Ms. Keys as she is one of the few artists I like who has proven to be more than one dimensional as far as talent. But I have to say I didn't expect an album this GREAT! I consider an album great (which is rare) when I don't have to skip over more than 3 to 5 tracks--I haven't skipped over any song on this album. If I had to list any standout tracks, it would be nearly the whole track listing, but the following songs alone in particular made the purchase of this album more than worth it:<br />&quot;If I Was Your Woman&quot;--yeah, it's a remake but her rendition is just as powerful and heartfelt. It's my favorite upbeat song on the album.<br />&quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;--she lays her soul on the line with this one and the piano and &quot;phonecall&quot; skit only adds to the sincerity<br />&quot;Diary&quot;--this is my favorite ballad on the album. I feel as if I'm being carried away to another level whenever I hear this one. It's so deep and so beautiful.<br />&quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;--my second favorite ballad.

B00003CY5J|2.0|When you have a cast of Edward Norton, Robert Dinero and Marlin Brando you expect a great hit. Unfortunalty this wasn't it.<BR>The acting obviously was great. All three lived up to there abilities, the plot however was too straight and plain. I kept waiting for the twist that would make the movie but it never came. It is really an unfortunate dissapointment

B00004WGAA|4.0|This DVD of Carnival of Souls and Horror Hotel features fully restored and remastered prints from the best sources that exist in the US, in the case of Carnival of Souls, the best print that exists, period making this a great bargain priced alternative to the Carnival of Souls Criterion Collection DVD.  In the case of Horror Hotel, it was originally released in the UK as &quot;The City of The Dead&quot; and the VCI DVD uses the UK print, but for those that just want to see a version of the movie, such as myself, in excellent picture quality, this will definitely suffice, but purists shold get the VCI DVD.  The interactive menu is very gaudy looking and only has 2 scenes in the selection menu per movie, but you can go chapter browsing through the DVD remote anyway for both movies, plus there are bios of the cast, etc. of both movies plus a promo for other Diamond Entertainment DVDs.  Highly recommended for those Carnival of Souls and Horror Hotel fans on a tight budget but want quality.
B00006690F|5.0|this CD is just...WHOA!!!!!!!! besides al of Emz others CD this is the BEST cd everrrr..jus BUY IT u WONT regret it..ILL even give u ur money bak if you dont like it lol...i give the CD on a scale 5/5 a.......... ''10'' JUST BUY IT!!!!!!!! EMINEM ROX!!!-ebf

B000084T18|5.0|This is one of the best cds that I own,and i got alot.Every track is good.I could care less bout the beef,even though he does have some funny verses in the disses.If i had to side with someone,i would side with 50.This aint cuz i love 50,but i really dont like ja.Ive listened to all his cds except venni vetti vecci.Out of those 5 that i listened to(inluding the fast and furious),i like only a few of his songs.Other than that,he sucks.Back to the cd.As i said,every song is good,but not every song is off the hook.Buy this cd,only idiots dont like it.<BR>TOP 5=Dont Push Me,21 Questions,Many Men,Wat Up Gangsta,& In Da Club
B0000AXE8I|5.0|A lot of people told me that they did not like the 2nd episode.. but i thought it was great.. especially that fight scene with the hundreds of Mr.Smith.. :) .. i have to admit that it was rather confusing at times, and i was glad to have subtitles and chapters that i could watch over and over again..
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have read most of the reviews below and most of them are crap. You should be charged with murder for calling this Nu metal. If you can't differentiate prog and nu listen to Pain of Salvation as they are also labeled prog but for me is no different than Limping Park Biscuit or whatever the f*** they are.<br />ToT is the heaviest DT album which I'm happy that it is so. Many people have complained about lack of ideas, poor lyrics and that Petrucci is meaninglessly too fast. Well this is prog metal where musicians are supposed to show talent. If you want ideas and lyrics with deep meanings in every song go read poetry.  DT has provided enough ideas and good lyrics on previous albums and it is time to hear them really push their limits on their instruments.  I agree with everyone else on one thing though. The best James LaBrie is a non-singing James LaBrie. I'm fed up with his whining. He may be OK for a softer band but he's definitely not a metal singer.<br />This is very heavy prog metal and you shouldn't miss it if you are a DT fan. By the way in terms of sound this is the album that should have been recorded instead of St.Anger by Metallica. The resemblance is that strong with still the uncomparability of DT to any other band. The production is superb. Lars Ulrich should listen and see how he sounds like he's banging on empty trashcans.
B00005JM02|5.0|The title makes it appear to be not so great.. but then the animation is great!! and the story line is also very very good.. there were moments were i was holding my breath to see what happens next.. i'm glad i got the DVD.. the first scene was a little disturbing to little kids, so you may want to skip it initially..
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Every once in a while an album comes along that represents the best that a music genre has to offer (eg.Metallica's 'Master of Puppets' for metal, Jimmy Eat World's 'Clarity' for Emo etc.).And 'London Calling', the seminal offering from The Clash is punk's.Maybe not punk-rock or pop-punk, but definitley the best punk album, and probably my favourite album ever. Everything is on this record,reggae,rock,punk,pop,jazz and ska, and the legandary Joe Strummer is on top form here, battering out 3-chord anthems every step of the way.<br />It's Strummer's lyrical ability that makes this stand out so much, with a wide variety of topics such as spanish freedom fighters,the 'clampdown',ethnic diversity,love, and bizarley, Montgomery Clift! Songs such as the prophetic title track,'London Calling','Guns of Brixton','All Lost in the Supermarket','Death or Glory' and 'Train in Vain' are the particular standouts, but there are really no bad songs(with possible exception of 'Brand new Cadillic'.This is the best Clash album, and as such, the follow-up, 'Sandinista' was a bitter aftertaste.If you enjoy this, get their self-titled debut next,but i think this is the best entry point to The Clash, because of the wide variety of s#tyles present.<br />R.I.P Joe Strummer
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Two reasons for buying this CD Set:<br />a) Your brother just came out of a 30 year coma and after hearing \\"The Rising\\" he asks: \\"Cool! What else did this guy sing?\\"<br />or<br />b) You have every official recording ever made,you pay a lot of money for the unofficial ones, you enjoy hearing the 23rd different version/recording of \\"Thunder Road\\" in a cleaned up, enhanced digital version.<br />I don't have a brother, so here it goes:<br />Very clearly a \\"must have\\" for the fan and collector. In my book not because of the carrer milestones contained (and yes,  there are so many missing!!), but because of outstanding pieces such has \\"Trapped\\",\\"Lift me Up\\" and \\"Code of Silence\\" as well as the first Springsteen label release of \\"Dead Man Walking\\". I mean -it was a lot of fun finding the movie's Soundtrack release after a month of searching in a 2nd hand CD store, but I always felt it belonged onto a Springsteen release. It is definitely in the right spot now. The trouble with the old studio recordings on this CD -however enhanced- is that personally I feel they sound kind of \\"thin\\" and definitely a little sterile (reason could be thay I was spoiled by 4 live concerts over the last year). Personally I do like the studio recordings to \\"understand\\" the songs, but definitely want the live recordings to enjoy them - and see them evolve over time.<br />Long story, short point, it is definitely time for another \\"Live\\",this time maybe 1985-2004 (or do we have to wait until 2005 to make it an even number??) this one could easily sport 4 or even 6 CD's. How about a 10 Disc 1975-2005 Live set?How about a three CD set of songs beginning with the letter \\"B\\"???. :-)<BR>We can just never get enough.....
B000002HRE|3.0|I got this and 'Load' for Christmas,so I decided to come and finish my Metallica album reviews.I was genuinely surprised, as what I'd heard off the album ('The Memory Remains', and 'Fuel', 'The Memory Remains', and 'Devil's Dance' on 'S&M') was awful.But this is better than 'Load'.It is heavier and weirder, and I personaly prefer it to 'St.Anger' and '...And Justice For All'.It has a kind of groove, and is the only album where Newstead seems comfortable in his role.I still prefer their pre-1994 work, where they live up to their name and are a metal band, but this album is pretty good, and it would get a higher rating if it wasn't by METAL-lica.That said, 'Fuel' sounds good here, also worth a mention are 'Prince Charming', 'Where the Wild Things are', 'Unforgiven II' and 'Fixxer'.The best on the album is probably 'Fuel'.I also think that if 'No Leaf Clover' was on here it would be so much better, and the song would fit right in.The lyrics are the best thing here, probably the best since 'Master Of Puppets'.Anyway, I like 'ReLoad', and it has a quirky charm about it.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Yeah, it's another QOTSA album. Songs for the deaf is better than ratedR but not as good as their first album. Good production, good variety, and excellent value! My copy contained a great video bonus DVD! Sweet! <BR>There's a lot to like here, and despite QOTSA's success they still stay true to themselves. First it giveth is their second best song ever, after Avon. This release is harder than what they've done before, almost thrashy in places.
B0000DDPEQ|5.0|Cuando escuch por primera ocasin este cd, realmente es distinto al trabajo que se public bajo el mando del productor Phil Spector en 1970. Si bien, era la ltima etapa del grupo por el cmulo de problemas y desacuerdos que tenan. Este trabajo es una joya. Habr personas detractoras que no justifiquen esta versin de Let it be, y que hasta algunos &quot;crticos&quot; lo comparen con el Lp de The Rolling Stones &quot;Let it bleed&quot; que tambin fue publicado por esa fecha (comparacin que resulta injustificada, pues entre ambos grupos hay una diferencia en cuanto al concepto musical). Originalmente, concebido como Get back, este proyecto resultaba ser interesante; grabar un album en vivo, sin tener que trabajr mucho en l, con los famosos recordings, pero por los problemas internos entre los &quot;Fab Four&quot; no fructific. Sin embargo, no obstante el tiempo transcurrido, el producto concebido en primer instancia es fenomenal. Si en este cd, hay un amalgama interesante de canciones. Por ejemplo, &quot;The long and winding road&quot; est desprovista de esas orquestaciones que no tenan ninguna justificacin en estar incluidas en la cancin. Tena razn, McCartney en disgustarse por el trabajo hecho por Spector en esta rola. Esta cancin suena conmovedora, de gran sentimiento, quizs -lo supongo as- porque se avecinaba la disolucin del grupo. Otra cancin que se escucha sensacional es &quot;Across the universe&quot;. Si la letra de esta cancin de Lennon es preciosa, solo faltaba el toque final en cuanto al arreglo musical y aqu como est en este cd, es maravillosa; una voz cristalina, sin la orquestacin al estilo Hollywood (como sali en Let it be) o con los coros femeninos (Past masters vol 2); definitivamente en mi gusto personal, me quedo con esta versin. De las dems rolas, Let it be suena tambin distinto; el trabajo que efectu Billy Preston le da ese toque de sentimiento. Definitivamente, este material bajo la produccin de George Martin, es untrabajo 100% beatle. Si, porque en el de Spector, si bien, el album en algunos momentos suena muy bien, hay otros, en que todo ese trabajo de produccin quita o minimiza el sonido beatle. No hay que olvidarnos que Martin es un gran conocedor de la msica clsica y que l supo dotar a algunas canciones de los Beatles esos arreglos dndoles un efecto esttico muy agradable y magistral -escchese Eleonor Rigby, I am the walrus, A day in the life, entre otras-. Mencin aparte, hago de Ive got a feeling y One after 909, que son dos grandes rolas rockanroleras, de la ltima, me atrevo a decir, que suena a skiffle, nostalgia por los primeros aos en que comenz el grupo, o qu decir de Two of us, una cancin al estilo folk. De tintes blueseros &quot;Don't let me down&quot;, interpretacin fluida; en mi opinin puedo apreciar mejor en este cd el trabajo hecho por Starr en la batera, sobretodo en los &quot;platos&quot;, adems, sin duda es una de las mejores canciones de Lennon, en la etapa final del grupo. Me hubiera gustado que hubieran incluido los ocho minutos de la jocosa y divertida &quot;Dig it&quot;, aunque hay que conformarse con las versiones sacadas en los famosos &quot;bootlegs&quot;. Para cualquier beatlmano, o amante de la msica en general, este cd vale la pena adquirirlo. : )
B00004TH6O|3.0|QOTSA first album was perfect, this one is good but lacks something... There are bright spots, like &quot;feel good hit of the summer&quot;, but the production bugged me. It's still good, and should get 3.5 stars, but I don't know, it just doesn't have that certain specialness QOTSA's other releases have. Like they didn't try as hard with this one or something. That's just me, lots of people LOVE this release. I can take it or leave it.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I was given a copy of BABE on DVD a couple of years ago as a gift (my girlfriend--who loves pigs--knew this is one of my favorite movies), but I was thoroughly disgusted to find, upon putting in in the DVD player, that it was a FULLSCREEN edition.  I didn't even bother to finish rewatching it.  I was further disgusted to learn that a widescreen edition didn't even exist.  <br />I was ecstatic to learn while Christmas shopping that a widescreen edition had recently been released.  I snatched a copy of immediately, and I am happy to report that the movie was as good as I remembered it being.  The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscar, and I was pulling hard for it to beat the bathetic and overblown BRAVEHEART for the award.  Unfortunately, the best film did not win (as so oftens happens).  <br />I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough.
B000001A3H|5.0|'92 and they tuned down to C, and let it rip. This got me through high school grad. Great stuff, very old school, with a Misfits meets Sabbath influence. Writhe is classic. Saw QOTSA play couple tunes from this live and was reminded how good the material here is.
B00005JMCN|3.0|Anyone enjoying the movie should definitely go on to read the book.  The two are not even remotely comparable.  The movie is a bit disappointing, as is so often the case, if you read the book first.  There is so much detail that had to be left out, and so many major facts that have to be altered.  <br />So, if you haven't read the book, do so.  If you loved the movie, you'll like the book more.  If you liked the movie, you will probably love the book.  And if you disliked the movie, you will still probably love the movie.<br />I did like Chris Cooper a lot in his role as the trainer, though he talks a lot more in the movie than he was reputed to talk in real life, where his silence was famous.
B000002HEP|5.0|Everybody else is right; this is one of the best albums ever made by anyone. Staying power it has in spades; had this since it came out and it still provides immense enjoyment. It's got this great murky, smooth heavy production- I mean murky in a GOOD way. They paid attention when mixing this album, it has an old school coolness, a classic. So much affection for this album, this is why Kyuss are legends.
B00005JMF6|4.0|Gothika was a very good movie.The end seemed rather..blah. lol..no way to describe it. Halle Berry was good for the role.
6302891272|4.0|I am a student at Nagoya International School, and have recently studied Shakespeare's Macbeth in my English class. After reading the original Macbeth, we watched several versions (Polanski, BBC, and RSC) which included Kurosawa's version of Macbeth, &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;. Each of Polanski, BBC, and RSC version reflected Shakespeare's original version of Macbeth, its rich and fluent language, and its fabulously distributed plot. Because of language difference, and difficulty to transfer Shakespearian language directly into Japanese, it seemed as though the value has been lost, but as a Japanese citizen, I was eager to understand that Kurosawa had used old fashioned Japanese language in his film, which created an harmony which can be compared to or to support the lackness of Shakespeare's language. I also enjoyed the way how Kurosawa transferred the witches of the original version, into 'evil spirits' or what is called 'mononoke' in Japanese. Kurosawa probably named the forest and the castle to match the evil spirit , or Macbeth's (Washizu) fate. The evil spirit appeared in white robe, with white messy hair, spinning a wheel in its hand, a stereotype of what a Japanese would imagine as a 'mononoke'. Cobweb or 'spider' was such a great aspect to extract the evilness of the original witches of Macbeth, because of the replacement of the witches to a 'mononoke'. The black and white film also contributed to express the 'spookiness' in the evil spirit. With some of these changes, Kurosawa perfectly fitted Macbeth itself from an English story into a brand new Japanese film, using ancient Japanese culture (ex. feudal systems, japanese chivalry). He was successful in translating the original Macbeth for the Japanese, to spread the wonderfulness of the Shakespearian plays to a new and wide ranged people.
0920668372|5.0|When my mother gave me this book, to read to my children (then 3 years old), I read it myself first, and wept.  Not because the book is sad, though it does touch (very lightly) upon the mortality of man, but because the story is about unconditional love, the giving and receiving of it.<br />Some who have reviewed this book here find it 'creepy' and 'sick', and for them, I can only say that I feel sorry for them, that they were not able to see the message behind the obviously silly delivery, which I think is given in order to elicit a giggle from the child you're reading the story to.<br />And when the now-grown child of the woman comes to her bedside, when she can no longer hold him in her arms... that he cradles her in his, showing her that he understands that she has loved him for just who he is, and that he in turn loves her with the same depth, touches me, as it does for most of the people I've discussed this book with.<br />Give the book a chance, and give your child a warm, rocking embrace after you read the book. They'll understand.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater could (and has been) so much more.  <br />I am not a muscician so I will not discuss the merits (or lack thereof) of the musical performances in this recording.  However, I will comment on the direction this album seems to be taking the band.  DT has often been a band of stylistical imitators (not originators).  This seems to be increasingly the case and will likely remain the case if Portnoy and Petrucci continue to self-produce their recordings. To fully fulfill the potential, this band needs an outside viewpoint in the rehersal and recording studios; think how different this record might have been with any number of producers: Steve Albini, Brendan O'Brien, Rupert Hyne, etc.
0312263120|3.0|First, let me say that I have read Dan Brown before and enjoyed it greatly.  The first book I read of his was The Da Vinci Code, which was an excellent book.  I appreciated Angels and Demons as well.  However, this book was a major let down when I read it.  The other books of his focused much less on technology although there was certainly some.  However, it seems that he never really had a grasp on it.<br />Technology is the source of most of the flaws in the book.  A few of the flaws include the fact that it is impossible to send a program through text mail, which ARA forwarding undoubtedly entails in the book, bits are not the same as bytes, although Brown misses this fact on occasion, and I found no mention of rotating cleartext, a major facet of the book, when I searched the Internet, and I believe it is probably made up completely.<br />I would have let all that go though and given it 4 stars, except that there are non-technical errors as well.  For example, on one equation he refers to bacterial viruses, although that is a contradiction.  At another point he says gold is durable, when it is actually a very soft metal.  There are other issues, and they really add up and start to get on your nerves.<br />Some of the plot in the book really isn't reasonable either.  Why are the members of the NSA soooo stupid at times.  Don't they have a 170 I.Q.?  Why is there a deaf assasin?<br />For these reasons, and others, I heartily recommend an alternate Dan Brown read.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Though my least favorite Radiohead album (sans-Pablo Honey), Amnesiac is still an ecclectic, totally abstract piece of music that you're not going to bare any comparisons to. In short, it's Radiohead attempting to move forward in the arena of progressive rock.<br />Personally, I dig it. Note, however, I don't adore it, like I do OK Computer, Kid A, and to a slightly lesser extent The Bends and Hail to the Thief. Why is this the case? I think because, simply put, the textures and overall musical palette aren't nearly as colorful as the band's other works. It's a very harsh and disagreeable album at times, despite some claiming it as a work of unheard brilliance, and the first track is a perfect example of this. While the melodies and rhythms found therein are indeed creative and appealing, the synthesizers and other blips and bleeps used are far from, hmmmmm, blissful? Granted, OK Computer and Kid A both featured such sounds, but Amnesiac is the first album where they actually grate my mind. To be fair, only a few of the songs offer such unsettling dissonance, but it's nonetheless a small flaw in an otherwise great album.<br />So, yeah, Amnesiac is without question even less accessible than any of Radiohead's other albums, and probably one of the least accessible albums of new century. Note, however, this does not mean the album isn't absolutely heavenly at times, with moments of beauty only the most talented of musicians could create. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is the first example of this -- no doubt the most emotionally heavy song on the album -- a, from what I've been told, musical retelling of Yorke's near-death experience (I don't even know if this is correct). Nonetheless, the song's one of the best Radiohead has ever created, with a  surreal portrait of a (the) Life beyond ours, driven primarily by a piano and Thom's melancholic but eeirly convincing and believable voice, with the added effect of some other worldly strings and synths. Other great (and I mean great) songs include &quot;You and Whose Army&quot;, a politically-charged, wistful song I can probably best compare to &quot;Exit Music&quot; from O.K. Computer; &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, a rock-rolling, guitar-driven piece that quite sincerely is as catchy and hypnotic as anything the band has ever written; and, well, every other song on the album. &quot;Knives Out&quot; and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; are probably the two other masterpieces on this album, but virtually every other song on the album (save for tracks 1 and 3) really is a success.<br />So yeah, now that I write this I really do seem to accept how good of an album Amnesiac really is, even if it isn't QUITE as stellar as Radiohead's other works. Some question the placement of the songs' order on the album, and I don't really care to comment, suffice to say the album manages to overcome any jagged edges presented by the set-up. Oh yeah, and I also prefer -- and I know I'm in the minority here -- Amnesiac's &quot;Morning Bell&quot; to Kid A's.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This cd is great. Just go out and buy it ....NOW !!!! And read the rest of my review when you return !!!!!<BR>Alicia has otdone herself this time. It will be very hard to surpass this cd next time. But I think Alicia is just getting started. There is one negative point and that is that altough there is some piano playing, I think Alicia should have done a little more piano playing on this cd. Like for example Joe Sample does on his cd's. I hope she will stay true and don't commercialize all her songs. I mean that she don't do any songs that are too commercial like the rest of the R&amp;B singers today. We have enough of those singers already. Alicia is one of a kind. I saw her perform live twice:<BR>1. For a tv station in Holland called BNN<BR>2. For a television show in Holland called &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;<BR>Those performances were amazing !!! If you read this Alicia, please bring out a LIVE concert cd next year !!!!!!! Or an Unplugged sesion, even better !!!!!<br />This is a great CD, very old school, very soulful, just buy it NOW !!!! Great job Alicia !!!
B000001GQQ|5.0|Dear David, <BR>I am a fans of Martha Argerich. I have numerous performances of Martha Argerich. I understand your opinion, but Martha Argerich when she's playing Prokofiev, she is 26 years old! I say that, because I have an other exhibition of her that plays Prokofiev in 1995 in Paris, and this performance is excellent in the style and the substance. Try to listen this performance and you will understand what I am saying.<br />Sorry for my english.<br />By<BR>Alessandro
B00005JKJA|1.0|Mullholland Drive is definately one of the worst movies I ever saw.<br />If you understand the plot, please email me and let me know.  Myself and a few million others would love to know.<br />The movie is beautifully made.  But there are many stories that in no way are connected.<br />Lynch may be some type of genius in some circles, but this movie, is a disaster.<br />As I said, if you are one of the nine people in the USA who understood the plot.... please clue me in.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|First and foremost, if you do not have an SACD, and are buying this because you are looking for a sonic upgrade to the 1996 remaster, you are wasting your money.  That is not criticism, just a fact.  As the liner notes state, the original stereo masters were used to make the &quot;regular&quot; stereo version of this CD.  They are not kidding.  If you've ever compared the original stereo album or CD to the remastered 1996 version, you would notice an incredible difference.  On the 1996 remix, the drums are brought further forward in the mix, the definition in much greater, and the placing of instruments in the mix (the &quot;soundstage&quot;) is different...and much improved.  The liner notes go on to state that they used the original stereo master because the first generation tapes had been found for the first time since the album was first recorded.  If that's true, it doesn't make a big difference.  I A/B..ed my old Mobile Fidelity Gold CD with this one and the only difference is that this is mastered considerably louder.  If Mobile Fidelity had to use a second generation master, you honestly can't hear the difference.<br />So why am rating this 5 stars?  Because they went back to the orignal multitrack (just like they did on the 1996 remaster) to do a 5.1 mix.  Since I don't yet own a SACD player, I can't comment on the mix, but I'm assuming and hoping it is as good as others here say it is.  <br />I am disappointed that they did not use this as an opportunity to upgrade the stereo mix they did in '96, or at least use the same one, because there is no doubt that it is superior, as it was remixed from the orginal multitracks, which means there is no &quot;2nd generation&quot; fidelity loss.  But I'm thinking that all the money and time was spent on the 5.1 mix, therefore this &quot;rediscovered&quot; stereo master was...well, convenient(i.e. timesaving and costsaving).<br />Just be forewarned, all you who do not have a SACD player.  You're getting the same mix, with pretty much the same fidelity, that you had on the orignal album and CD, just considerably louder.  But you ARE getting all that extra stuff on the other disc.  So look at the bright side.
0792833236|1.0|Yet another exampled of a 'great' movie that is highly overrated.<br />La Motta was a jerk.  Plain and simple.<br />The movie is well recorded, but that is it.<br />If you know why this is a 'great' movie, please email me and let me know.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I really don't know how to tell you this but this music is Wonderful!<BR>It is just that kind of music that makes your emotions float your body and mind.<BR>When I saw the movie, I didn't always notice the music but I know it wasn't only the sounds of the swords that sucked me deep into the movie's world.<BR>The thing is that this music is so good, that even without 4 huge speakers on each side, a Dolby Digital Surround System and a huge screen, this music makes you almost the same experience.<br />Generally, the disc is like a big concert, but one of the best you'll ever hear.
B000000W6R|4.0|Billy Corgan...was there a more prolific songwriter of the 90's?  For a guy that wrote 300+ songs in a decade (yeah, it's true) it's hard to say no.  Back early in the game with only two albums to their name the Pumpkins put out this excellent collection of B-sides in 1994 (and it wasn't even close to a complete collection, where's Purr Snickety or Glynis or ....?). And the scary thing?  There really isn't much pure filler here.  A lot of these could have been A-Sides.  Hell, a lot of them SHOULD have been A-Sides.  With B-side collections you usually get an album with two or three good songs and then about 10 half-baked ideas.  That's not the case here.  This album runs the course from moments of beauty (the opener 'Soothe', the cover of 'Landslide') to furious rockers (the excellent one-two punch of 'Pissant' and 'Hello Kitty Kat').  With this release you can tell that the band (young at that point in time) was really having fun in the studio (something they lacked on later releases).  Tracks such as 'Frail and Bedazzled' seethe with youthful exhuburance and the attitude is contagious.  Sure, there are some tunes that don't altogether work; their take on'Girl Named Sandoz' exchanges manic soloing for an actual tune while 'Whir' floats gently down the stream without ever really catching hold, but contained on the album are many excellent tracks as well as two absolute astonishing numbers.  The first of these two is 'Obscured', a dream-like song that hovers around your ears without ever quite falling in.  It's one of those wonderful 'shoulda made the album' type of songs that you'll want to put on repeat.  The second of the two is 'Starla', an epic 10+ minute song that begins softly before building into a sonic freakout.  The band rocks out here like they're fighting for something they believe in.  Back in '94 they were a band with something to prove and with this song, they did.
B000001FS3|5.0|I first bought this tape when it came out in 1987. Something about the essence of the music applied it's self to me. Being in college and looking for new music I approached the music with some hesitation and skepticisim, as a the time it was 'pop music' (still a metalhead).<br />Upon listening to the music (many times over), I began to realize that U2 was addressing the issues of world politics that few had decided to address, and in the hit song, the sadness of of the how far some people go to NOT accept reality.<br />Is this a CD that you would not buy?
0440180295|5.0|This book probably is becoming more relevant in times like this where we need to think about why war exists and why it is so common between civilizations.  If it's something that no one wants to happen then why does it happen so often.  In the conflict with Iraq in the Spring of 2003 the opinions are split by two fervently polar sides.  This book was written in the midst of the Vietnam War at the height of popular disapproval of ongoing death of troops and destruction of property which were lost for no apparent reason.<br />Vonnegut I thought took a good approach with the book's subject material.  The book doesn't naturally talk about Vietnam which was naturally going to be admonished by one side and raved by the other or hating by both should the book be perceived as sitting on the fence.  He drew from his experiences of war from the bombing of Dresden to described the relevant events of Billy Pilgrim's, the hapless main character's, life.  The bombing of Dresden was the most devastating operation by the American forces upon a German city.  But its not just this that makes the book good and its not just about the bombing in Dresden as the book spans the whole adult life of Pilgrim.  From the start the book tells you that the book is written in a &quot;schizophrenic&quot; form that bounces Pilgrim back an forth through his life in the form of a stream of consciousness.  As the character experiences a certain emotion or speaks upon a certain subject, he switches into a different point in his life where he's experienced (or will experience) something similar.  This happens often within chapters and yet it is not confusing.  Ironically you'll also come out with a sedate feeling if you understand the point of the author and the quotes from reviewer of the book will make more sense the next time you read them on the front and back cover after reading this book.  The book was entertaining as well as memorable and philosophical.  I include memorable because Vonnegut creates passages that talk about an idea or a thing and that idea or thing becomes a symbol for something.  When the author recalls that iconographic idea its easy to understand the meaning of the passage and its these ideas that tie together the fabric of the plot.  The philosophical part was simply the moral of the book about knowing the difference between what you can change and what you cannot and knowing what to do in either case.  <br />I would recommend this book to college students and people who are uptight.
0790729725|1.0|This is one of the best film's of the 90's and next to the godfather, the best mafia film ever. The dvd however leaves a lot be desired. number one you have to turn it over halfway thourgh the movie. they couldn't put the whole movie on one side this is riddiclious, i can atleast watch the vhs without intruption of turning it over. The  other problem is there are no features at all and that is pittiful for such a great film. Warner brother's please put this out in 2 disc special edtion, untill then I will stick to my vhs and recomend you do to.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Just got my first listen to the &quot;Naked&quot; cd, and being a life-long Beatles fan, (Yes, I'm old. :) ) I completely enjoyed it. The Long and Winding Road was probably one of my least favorite songs on the original cd, but this version gave me a new appreciation for it. Some of the other differences are quite subtle, but I still very much enjoyed this cd. I think I'll keep them both....even the vinyl. :)
B00005JM02|2.0|I didn`t really like the actual story, but the computer graphic was very amazing.
B00005JLEU|5.0|From the legendary Studio Ghibli and anime director Hayao Miyazaki (of &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; &quot;Castle in the Sky,&quot; and &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service,&quot; among others) comes a new favorite among otaku (anime fans) world-wide. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is the story of a young Japanese girl named Chihiro (literally, &quot;heroine&quot;) who is, as the title implies, taken from her normal life and deposited reluctantly in a small town built around a bathhouse for spirits. Chihiro overcomes fear and other obstacles, including a large, faceless monster and a black-hearted witch named Yubaba (literally, &quot;old hag&quot;) to save her parents from a rather unpleasant fate. The story is exciting, well-paced, and thoughtful, with a good mix of humor, symbolism, emotion, traditional Japanese legend, and moral.<br />From an animation standpoint, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is astounding. The sheer amount of movement and energy in Hayao Miyazaki's most recent work is quite impressive. Combined with the beautiful scenery (including several awe-inspiring and detailed shots of the bathhouse that can by themselves be regarded as masterpieces), and the realistic textures of the grass blowing in the wind, the flower gardens around the bathhouse, and the interior of the bathhouse, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; is truly a work of art.<br />The only flaw in the otherwise near-perfect film is the dialogue. A few lines sound a little forced, and some intended to be funny simply aren't. Fortunately, these slip-ups are few and far between. <br />Already, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; has earned several prestigous distinctions, including the 2003 Oscar award for Best Animated Feature. Also, &quot;Spirited Away&quot; was anime released in movie theaters, which is rare in the United States. Ever rarer, it became the top-grossing film in America for several weekends in a row. Not surprisingly, it was also popular in Japan, where it became the top-grossing film in that nation's history.<br />Most people I have talked to have been very impressed with the quality of &quot;Spirited Away.&quot; Many of these have been adults, mislead by the films &quot;Disney&quot; tag. When they sat down to watch it with their kids, they simply expected another children's movie, but instead found a film they could enjoy and appreciate as well. On the face, the plot is simple enough for younger kids to understand, but the symbolism and artwork is so complicated and intricate that it can be enjoyed by adults and older kids as well. In other words, however cliché those words may be, this film really does have something for everyone, and is well worth your time and your twenty-five dollars.

B000002AVF|4.0|&quot;Daydream&quot; is the first album that Mariah experimented with a totally different sound, HipHop, and it is my favorite to date besides &quot;Charmbracelet&quot;. Mariah has three number one singles from this album, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, &quot;Always Be My Baby, and she later teamed up with ODB for the remix of &quot;Fantasy&quot;, which also went to number one. Other highlights on the album: &quot;Underneath the Stars&quot;, &quot;Long Ago&quot;, which she worked with Jermaine Dupri on, and &quot;Melt Away&quot;, which she worked with Babyface on. The song that really disappoints me: &quot;When I Saw You&quot;. I skip this song everytime. It lacks the formula Mariah usually uses. This album consists of R&amp;B, a little bit of HipHop, and smooth ballads. Definetly go get it.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|this music has depth and integrity.  while their songs can be considered mainstream and &quot;for the masses&quot;, they don't rely on the typical themes and riffs of pop music and that sets them apart.  this music is refreshing beacause it isn't just words (which are amazing in and of themselves), it's beautiful guitar, piano, drums and an amazing voice to bring the songs to life.  this music can make your spirit soar (clocks, everything's not lost), make tears fall (the scientist, amsterdam),remind you how absolutely beautiful life is (clocks, don't panic) or make you realize that there are things beyond the worlds we build around ourselves (politik, a rush of blood to the head).  you can tell that coldplay as a band is passionate about the music they make and that shines through in its presentation.  plus they're all really hot (ultra-super).  I LOVE YOU JONNY!
0061015725|5.0|Imagine in one week how planet earth could fall victim to swarms of self-reproducing nanorobots.  These micro-flying machines are individually dumb, but making use of the &quot;predator prey&quot; algorithms, form highly intelligent swarms that can attack the existance of the human race.  The drama is gripping in a classic &quot;who do you trust&quot; scenario.  Can Jack trust his wife Julia?  Is she having an affair?  Is she even his wife anymore?  Can Jack trust the other workers at the plant?  Can Jack save his family?  You sort of know the end from Crichton's introduction, but you don't really know it, which makes for a very interesting book.  The last day stretches out and you feel like you are reading the dramatic events in the time it took for them to occur.  <br />This book is an easy read, but filled with unnecessary profanity.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend it.

B00005JLTN|5.0|I really liked this sequel, I even liked it better the first one.  It's my fav in the series.  Don't get me wrong, the first was great too.  The first may be one of the greatest sci/fi action movies ever made.  I give the first an A+, But I give this A+++.  I know there lots of others who found Reloaded to be a dissapointing sequel, and they might find it weird that I liked this one more. Well if anybody has a problem w/ that, then BACK OFF!!  keeep your opinions to yourself.  This movie is flled with lots of fun. There is so much action in this movie.  I will admit that when I went to see this film in theaters, I was having low expectations of this movie b/c most sequels don't live up to the original and that I saw lots of bad reviews for this movie.  But that only made this movie more enjoyable.  I walked out of theater wanting to see it again.  Now here is the plot.<BR>We are introduced to Zion, the last human city.  The humans have learned that the machines are about to learn the location of the city, and the humans must prevent that from happening.  And not only that, Agent smith lives again.   He is now a different type of programm which he also can copy himself on to other programs.  He is now both a threat to Neo and the regular agents from the Matrix .  Neo Trinity, and Morpheus and a group of other humans such as Niome (Jada Pinkett smith) must travel through the Matrix in order to find a way to stop the machines.  They are at the same time are trying to prove the prophecy true, that Neo (a.k.a. the ONE) will be able save the humans and stop the machines.  As they are in the matrix, they must battle the agents and a new assasins such these &quot;ghostly Twins&quot; who have the ability to pass through walls (like like Shadowcat from X-MEN).  Neo must be able to find a &quot;source&quot; in the Matrix to help destroy the Machines.<BR>Anyway, Matrix Reloaded is a very fun film.  I liked this one better because there is so much more action in this one then the first.  Not mention that huge might scene between Neo and 100 agant smiths.  I liked that b/c there was alot of fighting and it was so long too.  It was the best part in this movie.  Plus that whole Freeway chase scene was yet another enjoyable part of this film.  I really suggest you see this movie.

I think the only real flaw in this DVD are all those stinkin adds spamming up the place but after youre through watching those you get to see the one and only Animal House! Yes I think its mean spitited humor to see someone bully the weak but everything else in this movie is super keen funny.John Belushi was awesome.He is dearly missed.Its pretty awesome.
B00006879E|5.0|I think all of the songs on this album is really good (and that's rather unusual)! This is one of my all time favorite albums. But I didn't like it as much as I do now the first time I listened to it...the songs get better the more you listen to them. It's sexy music, that's how I would describe it. Maroon 5 is a really great band and I love their videos too!

I got my hands on their first album a few months back, and immediatelly loved it. When recently hearing 12:51 on the radio (very catchy song), I immediately decided to try the new album and see how it adds up to its predicessor. After listening all the way through the album a few times, i can safely say that its worth the money that you pay for it, but probably wont go down in musical history. You would have to be living under a rock to realize that almost everything they do is nothing new, mostly just another restatement of musical style blended together with their little twist. I am sick of hearing the reviews calling this album complete musical crap, composed of simple chord progression without little talent. Their is a reason behind the simplicity, its what makes the strokes the strokes, and made bands like the ramones, the ramones. Some say that Julian disguises his voice behind distortion, but if you didnt get the memo, its this thing called LO-FI music. And for those who dont agree with Fab's style of drumming, ask a  drummer and they'll probably agree with me that his minimalisic style is very suiting and innovative. There is a time and place for fills, and in most cases here their not necessary. The drummer for AC/DC almost never has a fill, that doesnt make him any less talented. <BR>So if you like very complex music, this probably isnt your place. But if your looking for a decent album and have interest in the easy going rock nature of the strokes, give this album a go. It probably wont be your favorite album, but its definantly worth the money and time listening to.
B000089RVX|3.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  LACUNA COIL has had this style (that Evan is trying to emulate) since 1996 when they put out thier first EP.  It's been done and by a much better band than these guys.  If you like the style but want more substance and talent, check out Lacuna Coil:<br />Comalies<BR>Unleashed Memories<BR>In a Reverie<br />Any song on any of the above Lacuna Coil albums has more substance, style and talent than the entire Fallen CD.
B000068TPN|5.0|&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is possibly one of the finest war movies to date. It combines 3 elements that set it apart from many other war films: it details the lives of the families of soldier's in war, it shows the incredible resiliance of soldiers in the battlefield, and it convays the power of the sacrfice made for this country in a very realistic manner. I am a Chaplain Assistant in the 1st Calvary Division, the same unit of which is found in this film. Being very familiar with my unit's decorated history, I found this film's accuracy and honesty refreshing. I think that more people should be shown this film, in the hopes that they can see how great the struggle of war is: it destroys countries, friends, families, and people. And yet the American soldier has always stood strong, defending his country, protecting his comrades, returning loyally to his family, and honoring those who die in battle. The movie pays great testament to what we fight for. Please, watch this movie, and remember the American soldier. Your prayers and support is what helps us remember what we are fighting for out on the battlefield. Great movie, a must see! God bless America!!!
6304712936|5.0|I've seen this movie for the first time a couple of days ago, and I just can't get it out of my mind. The plot is amazing, you are enchanted by it and can't get out until the end of the movie. The actors, especially the one that acts Mozart, are great, and add to the great plot. The incredible music of Mozart is wisefully combined in the movie, and is a part of the plot and not just background. Together, they create a powerfull, Beautiful and terrifying, thrilling and hilarious, movie, that will leave its impression on the watcher.<br />I also think that it's a good movie to watch with the young musician, say 14, especially those that play Mozart anyway. I liked Mozart before I saw this movie, but now i'm interested in him. I'm reading his biography, and now I listen to his music with more understanding to the man behind it.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Well I'm sitting here listening to my new album to my Beatles collection....  Yes, some songs have been shortened and pieces have been a bit altered, however, if you would just sit down and listen to the music, you will admire it for what its worth.  A true fan of the music doesn't compare its technical aspects.  I might recommend a good set of headphones on a good system if you're listening to it alone.  There's two cd's in the set.  Cd #2 sounds more like an audition tape, but its really fun to listen to.  You hear them collaborating on the album in the studio, goofing off and having fun.  You hear John in the background going, \\"you guys are always thinking of what we bloody could have done.  Just play the f'n music.\\"  Paul is heard, \\"well if we do it this way, it might sound better.\\"  It's fun.  Just listen to the music and don't think of the technical junk.  The music is still #1.  Thanks again Paul for another piece of history.
B000002HMH|3.0|Ok most metallica fans will most probably have this 1996 effort by Metallica somewhere towards the back of their record collection however it would be wrong to dismiss this particular as Crap or rubbish, as far as im concerned it accentuates the fact that Metallica can play in all different genres outside the heavy metal they are expected to lash out every time. Most of the songs on load are far more pensive than the pre 1991 stuff but i think you can link most of the softer songs on this album to songs like Welcome Home (1986) and Fade to Black (1984)which were pre 1991, so Metallica fans should stop complaining about this album because so of the more thoughtful songs on this album are more similer to some of the better stuff then most people think
B0000029GA|5.0|&quot;Rappers I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin/ musician, inflicting composition of pain.&quot; I could go on for 6 more bars, but these are enough. In two lines, Nas rhymes 6 times. Most rappers find it hard to meaningfully rhyme 6 times in a song. Thus begins the best song on the best album by the best artist ever. Every great rap CD you've ever heard has been based on Illmatic. This album singlehandedly ushered in a new way of rhyming and a new way of conveying that message to the audience. 10 years old but still as fresh as ever, Illmatic is a must have for any true hip hop head's collection. You may hear people complain about the beats or the use of &quot;big words&quot; in the songs. These complaints are not valid: a true fan can see past the beats and appreciate the beauty and unrivalled craftsmanship of Nas's urban poetry. Nas rhymes in ways no one had considered before his album: he rhymes in ways no one has approached since. Sure, there are other very good rap albums, plenty of opuses by brilliant rappers that are consistently in my CD player. But none have approached the revolutionary brilliance of Illmatic. After repeated listenings, all supposed faults seem to fall away and the true genius shine through. Sub par beats are perhaps a bonus, as they don't distract you from Nas's  rhyme schemes and messages.<br />If you have only $11 left in your pocket, spend it on this cd.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I heard about Gavin DeGraw from YM magazine. There was a page dedicated to him about becoming huge in the future. From that moment on, I knew he was going to be excellent. I went out and bought his album and was completely surprised with what I had stumbled upon. Gavin's writing style is so complete, so to the point, and graceful. The music is very smooth and the rhythms are perfect. There is not a song on this album that I don't like. <BR>\\"Follow Through\\" -- This song is catchy for being the first single. If you go to one of his shows, he explains what some of the meanings of the songs are. For example, I just went to a show, and he explained that this song is about how you want something, but you have to follow through to get what you want. <BR>I give this song 4 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"Chariot\\" -- This song is heaven to my ears. It's so catchy, the melody is great, and it's just so easy to get attached to. I have nothing more to say about this song, than it's just great. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"Just Friends\\" -- WOW! This is an amazing song!! It's definitely one of my favorites on the album!! I love how Gavin plays the piano in the beginning. It really sets up the song nicely. His voice goes very nicely with this musical arrangement. The song is different from some of the piano legends [Billy Joel, Elton John]...but better. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"[Nice To Meet You] Anyway\\" -- Ha Ha!! I love this song. At the show, Gavin said that this was about someone that you met, that you really liked, but then you meet someone else that you like more, and you say to the first individual, \\"Nice to meet you anyway.\\" It's such a great song...the great thing about this album is that it's very easy to sing along with him at a show. The lyrics are very simple to understand. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"Chemical Party\\" -- Ohhh yeahhh, baby!! This song is hot!!! HOT HOT HOT!! I loved how he really got into this song when he played live!! His band is great!! The best line is: \\"I think I like you, but you like this whole room, you sexy machine.\\" I just love it!! This song is just soo catchy...you gotta love it!! 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"Belief\\" -- Aww. I love this song. It's a great slow song, and Gavin's vocals are perfect on this number. It's about trusting someone, defending someone. It's a perfect, simple song. I love the simplicity of his songs. It's so amazing. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"Crush\\" -- Yet another amazing song. This song is a good song to see live. I love it. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"I Don't Want To Be\\" -- This is a great pop rock song. It is the theme song to the new WB show, \\"One Tree Hill\\", which is also a great show. Gavin will be performing on the show in January. But this is a great song...it talks about he just wants to be who he is. Nothing more, nothing less. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"Meaning\\" -- My favorite off the whole album. It's so simple, so perfect. This is a great song because the melody is so fresh and the lyrics are so real. They really \\"mean\\" something. Great job, Gavin. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"More Than Anyone\\" -- What a great love song. I love Gavin's voice -- it's so smooth, so romantic. Just a great song. Very simple. 5 out of 5 stars.<BR>\\"Over-rated\\" -- A good song, very slow start, but gets really into it, like 15 seconds later. A great rock song. It's really good. 4 out of 5 stars.<br />As you can see, if you don't pick up this record, you're truly missing out on someone great. Seriously, though, this guy is truly talented and needs to get some more publicity. He's amazing. Go see a show. I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00004XQP4|4.0|ok first of all, what in the hell are people whining about green day selling out? With warning green day changed their sound, breaching into new territory (much like the clash for all you punk purists out there). Songs like misery and deadbeat holiday realy show green day can do soemthing other than simple 3 chord punk drivel. Warning is a much more intelligent album, billie joe and co realy expanding their sound. Some people have said the organ riff from misery was a rip off from some other tune, but alot of tunes sound the same (try comparing the chorus of rancid's \\"arrested in shanghai\\" to like a rolling stone!) <BR>Warning: 7/10 but can get a little boring<br />blood,sex and booze: 9/10 a catchy tune proving they are still sticking to their \\"punk roots\\"<br />church on sunday: 6/10  a little pretentious bit a good tune<br />fashion victim: 10/10 i love this tune, it's a very poppy tune with alot of spite about the whole trendy punk thing<br />castaway: 9/10 my second favourite on this album.<br />misery: 10/10 excellent tune, new ground for green day<br />deadbeat holiday: 10/10 excellent tune, another clever change from their usual style<br />hold on: 5/10<br />jackass: 7/10 <br />waiting: 6/10 a little light for my tastes<br />minority: 8/10 a realy good tune (i dont understand how people can love this tune and hate the rest of the album?!?!)<br />macy's day parade: 5/10 pretty average tune.<br />overall: 8/10 not as good as some of their previous stuff but by NO means a sell out, awful album or pop album.<br />buy this album! it IS worth it, that is unless you are a single minded fool... i mean the definition of \\"punk\\" is so broad now even (shudder) good charlotte can qualitfy!<br />anyhow happy listening! (and please forgive me for my awful spelling)
B00005V9IJ|2.0|Major criticisms...1] the protagonist was not initially likable, nor was his love interest engaging [no pun intended]...why does Hollywood do this? Intelligent, well educated [not necessarily formally], honorable individuals are so much more interesting than nerds...and therefore more gratifying and rewarding to identify with. The challenges on the island would tax even a sagacious survivalist. 2]the Wilson thing was misplaced, even for a nerd...the island undoubtedly had insect life, therefore bird life. An orphaned baby bird out of the nest, for instance, would have offered the magic and mystery of a pure personality to care and provide for, which, if lost at sea, would have been truly tragic...albeit much more difficult to film.<BR>Minor complaints...1]Hitting the water at ~250 miles an hour would have thrown Chuck forward, not back...he should have braced himself against something for impact. 2]The minutia of survival could have been educating and fascinating. 3]Trying to knock out an endodontically ravaged upper molar with the given vector would have broken the tooth off at the gumline...and left the offending roots intact. 4]Most importantly, the last time we see the Helen Hunt character should have been the scene at the airport...the subsequent scenes were manipulative, maudlin, and over played. I wish we had spent more time with the \\"civilized\\" Chuck...with even less dialogue...solitude IS civilizing.<BR>Compliments...Silvestri's score is magnificent and well placed...as good as it gets...also the cinematography at sea. The final fade out and ambiguity is brilliant, ranking the ending as one of my dozen or so favorites {Vertigo,,Wild Bunch,Lady Jane,The Conversation,Breaker Morant,Silent Running, In The Bedroom,Mr.Roberts instantly come to mind].
B00003CXE7|4.0|\\"Gladiator\\" has many ups and downs.  In many ways, I agree with some reviewers who describe the plot as thin and lacking real substance.  While the story does follow a mock Shakespearian line, the film is really not that surprising and I was not awed by the acting performances in this film, save Crowe.  \\"Braveheart,\\" a similar film, had a little more to offer as far as a turbulent plot is concerned, but let's face it-it's the same kind of movie.  We are not dealing with a movie that is supposed to achieve greatness through its clever dialogue and wit.  This film is an entertaining visual splash that I believe succeeds quite splendidly.  If you love action films, the wonderfully choreographed combat scenes that star Crowe and his Roman short sword are spectacular.<br />Joaquin Phoenix just annoyed me in this film-plain and simple.  So, in part, you could say that he was doing his job.  But he was a bit over-the-top in his bad Shakespearian rendition of Commodus and I just wanted him to get off the screen whenever the camera fell upon him.  Instead of creating an interesting villain, Phoenix created another stock \\"woe's me\\" character.  Crowe's performance, on the other hand, is quite good-particularly for the amount of lines that he has to prove himself.  The scenes that show Rome at its height are impressive and I enjoyed the transformed time period of this film.<br />\\"Gladiator\\" is a summer blockbuster that is a fun film, a movie that can be watched over and over again.  Despite its surface-deep dialogue and lousy attempt to pull-off a psychologically driven, Shakespearian plot, it manages to lay out one of the more enriching action films of recent years.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I may be 54 now but Patrick Swayze can still get my blood boiling hot and rushing madly through my old vascular system anytime! I have seen this movie at least 100 times. I know every line for every character, every action before it occurs --- yet I never grow tired of watching the movie nor listening to the music. I think I wore out my original music cassettes --- I played them over and over, for years. It brings back memories of gentler times...less complicated times...shortly before our innocence was violently stripped away forever.<br />Until reading the reviews online, I didn't realize that my passion for this movie was shared by so many others. Many times in the past, I was embarrassed to admit my longtime \\"love affair\\" with \\"Dirty Dancing\\" --- it seemed almost juvenile, as if I hadn't \\"grown up\\" yet emotionally. The music and dancing are timeless...sensual, romantic, perfect foreplay...they can bring me out of the bluest blues instantly, or set sparks of love glowing inside quicker than anything else legally available. ;)<br />Although \\"Dirty Dancing\\" may never be considered a classic like \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" it's a definite must-see for every generation. Since I came of age in the 1960's, this movie will always be part of my growing-up years...despite the fact that I was about 37 or so when it first hit the wide screen. :)  As for the music, there is no competition in my heart.<br />Definitely 5 stars...DVD belongs in every movie and music lovers' collections, as well as in \\"time capsules\\" for future generations.  ;)<br />My only comment is that Jennifer Grey looked so much better before the plastic surgery on her nose. Her old nose gave her more character, more appeal...she'll never resemble \\"Baby\\" with that \\"new and improved\\" model.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|While I absolutely LOVE &quot;My Aim Is True,&quot; I honestly think this album is a bit more than an iota better. While in modern days, his light may have been dimmed quite a bit, back in the day Elvis Costello was an immense luminary, a visionary. He saw what he liked; he wrote about it. He saw what he disliked; he wrote about it. He even took on corporate music and the radio with &quot;Radio, Radio,&quot; playing it on Saturday Night Live in protest of his record company's indefatigable requests to play &quot;Less Than Zero&quot; (a solid good song, mind you, but overplayed). <br />Then there's the opener, &quot;No Action&quot; covers a relationship that is more like a game, where at least one person is not sure what the real terms of the relationship are, and the other just wants the unsure member to go away. Meanwhile, on a completely different note, &quot;Pump It Up&quot; (with its powerful, repetitive guitar and organ chords) takes a stand against doing things in excess. &quot;Pump it up until you can feel it, pump it up when you don't really need it.&quot;<br />If you're a real music fan, you'll own this and &quot;My Aim Is True.&quot;
B00005ATQF|5.0|Well, to: &quot;A Viewer from California&quot; you are correct and incorrect <BR>Spartacus and 2001: A Space Odyssey were the only films he shot using a &quot;widescreen&quot; format All the rest were shot full frame. <BR>However, A Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon were shot full frame and released in most theaters in the matted 1.66 : 1 widescreen ratio, and The Shining, FULL METAL JACKET and Eyes Wide Shut were shot open-matted (or full-frame/standard) and matt-framed for a theatrical release in the American standard ratio of 1.85 : 1. <br />On the dvd case of FMJ it says standard (full frame) version , but you are not missing any of the shot as you would if it was shot widescreen and then cropped for tv format, So you see everything that was actually filmed!!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|even though i had heard some of the songs on this album before, i bought it because ive been hoping to find something like this for a while. a collection of rare pearl jam. they had so many b- sides to singles and fan club releases that i had never even heard of..im so glad they made this!!  it is basically a history of the band and a tribute to thier diversity. it has become one of my all time favorite pearl jam albums. i cant believe some of these songs didnt make it onto an album before!! on cd # 2..i listen to the first three songs.. fatal..otherside.. and hard to imagine over and over! hold on   is another hit.they even have a funny but dead on surf guitar tune! This cd is a bunch of thier misfit songs spanning 12 years..songs that didnt really fit on thier intended album releases..that all fit together perfectly now! the songs are like lost dogs. im so glad they found them...guys..if you have anymore... keep diggin em up.. please keep making music!!!!!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Ok, I know ToT does not sound anything like Images &amp; Words (which is one of their best if not THE best), but it's a good album. The good: very technical drumming by Mike Portnoy, as usual, long songs as Dream Theater has done in every album so far, and James LaBrie's voice has matured. The bad: sounds way too nu-metalish for Dream Theater, Mike's snare drum is too high pitched for Dream Theater's sound, there's absolutely NO melodic/stuck-in-your-head-forever/harmony kind of songs like Another Day, Surrounded, etc, and last....James Labrie's voice has matured. HaHa, I know I already said that, but it's a good AND a bad thing. It's good because it actually sounds kind of cool and kinda sounds a lil like James Hetfield, but it's bad because it just doesn't sound like Dream Theater. This is a great cd, just not quite what you would expect from Dream Theater.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Many movies about 12 year olds aren't as realistic to life nowadays, as this one is. I'm 11 and girls my age really do talk like this, maybe not to the extent, but I'm glad that they don't act like 12 year olds are babies, unlike many other films. The acting was also superb and it's great to see Christina Ricci when she was younger. Great movie!
B000003TA4|5.0|First of all, I wasn't lucky like many of you to discover Nirvana on the early ninetees, cuz I was made to believe that they are just a bunch of junkies who yell and scream. It wasn't so hard to convince me to believe in anything then cuz I was just an 10-12 years old kid. I discovered them just last year, and since then its needless to say that Nirvana has become my way of living , my religion. And there are many reasons for that. Nobody can't denie that after `Nevermind` rock was changed, the music was changed, the fashion industry was changed, the way of living was changed, the entire world was changed, and I can't believe that some of us here say things like : \\"overrated\\" ,\\"just average\\", \\"led zeppelin better\\", \\"limp bizkit better\\" , \\"britney spears better\\"..., bla bla bla. Just the fact that after 13 years Nevermind is on top 200 in Amazon sales rank speaks for itself
B000001G1E|5.0|One of the greatest artistic achievements of the 20th century.  No one has expressed more passionate humanity, or human passion, in music than James Brown.  I only wish I could have seen him live sometime in the 60's or 70's.  Instead, I have him on several video tapes.  Seeing him sliding across the stage on one foot, throwing the mike stand forward, spinning around just in time to catch it on its way back up--Maaan! Listening to anything on this set of discs will blow your troubles away--right now!  My personal favorites are \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", \\"Papa Don't Take No Mess\\", \\"Licking Stick\\", and \\"Brand New Bag\\".  When I get to be an old white guy, instead of the middle-aged one I am now, I will have my boombox in the nursing home.  You'd better believe I'm going to crank out \\"Star Time\\" at full volume--I hope they throw me out!  Get on the good foot with Mr. Dynamite, the amazing Mr. Please, Please, Please, the hardest working man in show business . . . Huh! Good God, Y'all!
0385484518|1.0|My wife and I have been married for twenty-eight years.  We don't agree on everything.  But we both agree that the first Lord of the Rings movie was boring, post-Shire, and we both agree that Tuesdays With Morrie is a waste.  Perhaps we're simply not attuned to the nuances of digitized action in the one case.  (It isn't the violence per se that we didn't like.  We both loved The Last Samurai.)  Perhaps we're not attuned to the varieties of human emotion and experience in the case of Tuesdays With Morrie.  But I think not.  We have raised two boys, we have elderly parents, my father has died.<br />Anyway, we're kind of normal, but obviously we've missed the zeitgeist on Morrie here.  Actually, Morrie is perfectly cool.  It's Mitch who is so totally annoying.  Let me illustrate:  Morrie goes on for several pages about his kids and how great they are.  This is early in the book.  He's clearly in love with life and with his kids.  After he's done rhapsodizing about how great his children were and are, Mitch asks, \\"So would you do it again?  Would you have children again?\\"<br />How can a dolt who isn't even paying attention to this charming guy Morrie be trusted to convey the story?<br />Oh well, I'm happy when a book stays on the best seller list for ten million weeks, since it indicates that a lot of people are enjoying themselves reading it.  I wouldn't necessarily post this review except that my secretary just gave my wife a copy of Mitch Albom's new book for Christmas.  That's so funny.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Where do i start about Bodom.  Alexi is the greatest guitar player of his time and any album he is on it shows.  Hatebreeder is classic Alexi.  He writes hook laden songs that do not compromise speed, technicality, or overall aggressiveness.  I do not honestly see how someone could say this band is untalented.  What the hell are these people listening to?  Granted CoB does not have mainstream appeal but there is no denying the talent.  Anyways more about the album.  This is the best drumming CD that CoB have.  Every drum part flows and connects well from riff to riff.  That's a statement considering CoB is know for guitars.  And then the guitars, oh my god.  Not as classical as Something Wild but just the right blend to keep everything fresh.  I love this album and you should too.  The best tracks are Silent Night Bodom Night, Hatebreeder, Children of Bodom, and Black Widow.
B000002MNR|5.0|If the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the words &quot;Mark Knopfler&quot; is &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, you probably won't like this one. But if you want to hear a pure MASTERPIECE, buy it now, then put this CD on and sit back and prepare for pure total sensory pleasurement beyond your wildest imagination.
1577311523|5.0|This book literally blew me away with its freshness, incisiveness,and clarity. In my opinion it cuts through all the guff of anyother religious or spiritual doctrine one can imagine, and synthesizes the real essences of these teachings into oneutterly powerful, breathtakingly well-written exposition ofthe true meaning of spiritual enlightenment. Even thoughI already have a copy that I share with my wife, I plan toorder my own personal copy to take with me where-ever I go; for the effect that reading merely a page or two hasis to literally and instantly jolt one out of the time-focussedinsanity of the ego, into the source of all infinite power - the present moment, in a way that no other book has evercome close to doing. Even though I am an avid reader,I don't think I will ever need to seek out any more bookson spiritual enlightenment, now that I have this one: This is the REAL McCoy. Along with another book that I highly recommend&quot; HE NEVER CALLED AGAIN.&quot;  These two books belong on everyone's book shelf.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I first watched the movie in Chelmsford, Essex (74) and it stunned me then how well it captured the essence of Floyd in concert. How 4 guys can produce master pieces, last time I saw them in Denver I think their was 12 or 12 musicians/singers on stage. In many respects they lost the raw energy they used to have prior to 'DSotM'. This DVD is a must have for new Floyd followers. It shows the masterpiece of 4 musicians. (And for once Mason is highlighted and you can see how well he really plays those drums!). It was during a concert at the Rainbow in London that all the power went out half way through Saucerful and he never missed a beat. Brought the tempo down, power came back on (they had their own generator! oil shortage and all) he brought it right back to where he was and on they went. Professionalism at it's best!<br />The video is ruined a bit by too many modern day images (it was 74! and actually shows how bad the original footage was.). Why use the space shuttle when a Saturn 4 blasting of the pad would have been perfect and it tune with the times. Graphics are great but again the computer-generated scenes of Pompeii took away from that 1974 look.  But, it's a keeper.
1878424319|4.0|Ruiz describes ancient Toltec wisdom and its relevance to modern times.  I, too, believe that the world is going through a spiritual evolution and that we will wake up to the grand illusion that we all bought in to.  He describes how we need to take responsiblity not only personally, but socially.  <br />A word of caution:  Don't confuse the words of empowerment by buying in to another illusion that you are soley responsible for every circumstance in your life.  The agreements that he writes about are consensual agreements.  They are agreements in which we buy in to at a higher level of consciousness which we share.  The implications for recognizing this are so that people don't feel soley responsible if they have cancer or other debilitating dis-ease.
B00005JMGC|1.0|This film uses the 50's as a set up for some cheesey hollywood rightous indignation. This film is as if Erin Brockovich travels through time to stop the evil institution of marriage. All men are slimy cheaters and all female students are kissing and touching eachother in a sexual way. Great acting from a great cast is wasted on this cliche' film. Why attack the fifties? Why set a film in the fifties if you hate them as the filmmakers do. Every 50's icon is viewed with a smirky contempt. You have to wonder what the point of making a film that condems the innocence of the 50's is, when we already live in the jaded opposite of the 50's.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld is the most creative and consistently funny of all time, and I can't believe of all the shows now on dvd, this one isn't. Come on, \\"Sanford and Son\\" is a dvd for God's sake (good show too). <br />I don't want to be a slave to syndicated time slots anymore! Do this for us Kramerica fans who aren't always home at 7:30 or 11:00 for WB's reruns who don't get to see the Kenny Rogers Roasters episode every time it airs. Do this for those of us who can hear ANY Seinfeld quote and know exactly which episode it's from (that's many of us by the way!)
B00005JMCW|5.0|very entertaining, great humor, cute movie
B000089RVX|3.0|before i start this review,im going to go ahead and tell you that i have not listened to the whole album. ive only listened to teh first 5 songs. so, now comes teh review. apparently this is one of those albums that takes a very patient soul to get into. i am not a patient soul. i found the first five songs (with teh exception of going under, and my immortal) to be very boring and slow paced. i know ya'll probably think that im drunk or something saying that &quot;bring me to life&quot; is slow paced, but onmce you hear it for the 1,000,000th time, it sorta loses its edge. i might be totally wrong about the labum, so if it will make you guys happy, ill listen to the album and then do another review! well, that all!<br />~*Meredith*~
B00005ATQD|1.0|I am a Kidman & Cruise fan. But, this film? What a stinker! Where was the plot? The suspence? Any sign of life would have helped. It was just a continous parade of bare boobs. You didn't care that people were threatened. You didn't care that they may have been murdered. The lines could have been read of off a teleprompter! What trash. What a disapointment!<BR>I've seen boxes of facial tissue that were more interesting.<BR>What a waste of time. Wow! I think I'll go stare at the screen saver on my DVD player! That's got to be more interesting!
B000089RVR|4.0|Perhaps it is the exact moment this music came into my life, but it truly spoke to me, and all of my friends.  Definitely worth the price, and a great improvement over her last CD.  The music is so soothing, and the lyrics are heartbreakingly real.... I absolutely loved it!
0385504209|2.0|If one regards this as fiction, I would rate this over-long book as &quot;fair.&quot;  I cannot believe that so many people are intrigued by it.  Yes, I read the whole thing and I followed through with some research. There is nothing new in this book; it's all been covered before without any proof that this is authentic.  I belong to a very high level book club with a lot of liberal, educated women (like myself) and most of them thought it was a fascinating read.  I think it was a very well crafted (but poorly written) book, and can't believe that so many people regard it as a true book that reveals this dastardly deed that the &quot;church&quot; has hidden for centuries.  You mean none of the reformers from Henry VIII to Luther to Calvin wouldn't have known about this secret and would have revealed itif it were true.  Not exactly trash, but not worth this hype.  The author did create a commercial success and I know very few people who haven't read it.  My name was 45th on the waiting list at the local library, so I bought it.  What a waste of money.  I am trading it in at the local Book Swap Shop, where I am sure it will be welcomed and sell rapidly.  At least I will be able to receive another (hopefully better) book in its stead.
B000089RVR|5.0|I absoultely love this album....ever song is so pure and straight from the heart and sure to touch the soul.  Can't wait to see what Dido has in mind for her next album
B00013F35I|4.0|I love Bruce, and I had to buy this because of &quot;The Rising&quot; material, but the sound was nowhere as good as the NYC show, still a must have, at times it just isn't too clear.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is not Mer de Noms. Anyone who expected it to be does not deserve to experience it. I have read many reviews from fans who were disappointed because the new APC disc is different from the first. Fans like these are what hurt the music industry. They leave no room for a band to grow, instead wanting every song to sound like their favorite track. Yes, Thirteenth Step is different, but it is amazing in a completely different way than Mer de Noms was amazing. The music is beautiful, finely-constructed art that is an experience in itself. Maynard adds to this will his (as usual) deep and mind blowing lyrics, and his voice, the best of all time. If you give this cd a chance, it will change you and grow before your eyes. Just don't expect it to be anything like you've heard before. It is not Tool, it is not Mer de Noms. It is Thirteenth Step, and it kicks ass.
0385508417|4.0|What a great, amusing holiday read about Christmas...I chuckled out loud at Luther's over the top neighbors and you really begin to think about how ridiculous the whole Christmas frenzy has become.  Wouldn't it be gret to skip the whole season and hassle?  Great read...definitely recommend it!
B0000DYJM6|4.0|I am a huge Pearl Jam fan.  And if i could give this album 4 1/2 stars I would. I have all their studio CDs along with various live shows and cover albums.  They are a class group who hasnt fallen into the trendy pop music of today.  <br />This album isn't their best but I guess that is the fact that these were songs that didn't make albums for some reason. I do find these songs extremley unique as most do not sound like the Pearl Jam we all know.  The one CD is more hard sounding with unique guitars and vocals by other in the group including stone and jack.  The second CD is more smooth and relaxing, a time where I find Eddie's voice to be great.  <br />I know I gave it 4 stars but it definatley better than that and anyone would like this CD.
B000024C7W|5.0|After controlling the 70s, Stevie released &quot;Journey Through the Secret Life of Plant&quot; and it was not well-received. I can't figure out why...oh, I know. Stevie decided to take a risk and do something different and most people didn't know what to think of it. That's sad because this album is one of the best albums of Stevie's career. This cd is beautiful and quite spiritual. It's just another example, why people call Stevie a &quot;genius&quot;. If you love Stevie, get this cd. You will love it. Trust me.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This is definatly not the Pearl Jam most know.  They didn't make this album to get radio time instead they made it from the heart. It is so unique that you can help but love it. It is a great album from start to finish.
B00004SZWD|5.0|In my opinion, Stevie Wonder is the greatest artist EVER!! Elvis wished he could worked it like this, but he couldn't. SO many artists have taken Stevie's style and try to claim it as their own, for example Justin Timberlake and Alicia Keys. But its safe to say, no one (in my generation) will touch this master. Songs like &quot;Love's In Need Of Love Today&quot;  and &quot;Have A Talk With God&quot; sounds just as fresh today, like it did back in the 70s. The classics from this masterpiece &quot;Sir Duke&quot;, &quot;I Wish&quot;, &quot;As&quot;, &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; and &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet&quot; still sends chill up/down my spine. And songs like &quot;Black Man&quot; and &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot; needs to be heard today more than ever. Another personal favorite of mine is &quot;Ngiculela/Es Una Historia/I Am Singing&quot;, Stevie was one of the few artists back in the 60s and 70s that recorded songs in multiple languages. If you are a music fan, your collection is not complete without this cd. Get it now!!
0385504209|5.0|This is a fictional book, but is based on many facts.  I was grabbed by this book and stayed up until 3 AM reading it until I finished it (which I normally don't do).  Excellent reading.  However, I would not recommend this book to my Aunt who is while, not a highly practicing catholic, believes in the New Testament.  This would shake her views on her life and faith and I wouldn't like to see that (her life has enough turmoil in it already!).  On the other hand, my father and I are not practicing catholics and we both found this book riveting.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Science fiction and the Western--two genres that were featured in the great television series of the fifties and sixties. \\"Firefly\\" combined the best elements of the Western and science fiction shows--creative story-telling, wonderful, believable characters, and a sense of humor! Add to that one of the best ensemble casts since \\"Hill Street Blues\\" (Note: when is that show going to make it to DVD??) and you have a really terrific series. It certainly should have gotten better treatment from the Fox network--evidently Rupert Murdoch and his merry band thought that \\"Joe Millionaire\\" was more intellectually stimulating entertainment! Well, this is the same group that sued Al Franken over \\"fair and balanced\\", so what else could we expect? At any rate, it's great to be able to enjoy \\"Firefly\\" again--especially, the \\"lost\\" episodes and the interesting audio commentary. I can't help wondering if the show had been on WB or UPN, perhaps we might be enjoying new episodes of \\"Firefly\\" this season!
B00005JMCN|2.0|Although this movie has some breathtaking and brilliantly filmed racing scenes that are uplifting and inspiring, making you want to cheer, the movie all in all is quite a disappointment which could have been much, much, better. First of all, the narration is absolutely unneccessary, and makes the film not only tv-ish, but boring after hearing the narration after the first half-hour. Second, the cast isn't too enjoyable, with newly-rising star Tobey Maguire, William H. Macy, (as a cameo (!)), and ofcourse, Seabiscuit taking the cake. Jeff Bridges is O.K., but like the movie could've been better, and Chris Cooper is his usual non-emotional, dull and grunting self, thank god he doesn't come in until the last hour. The love-story sucks, and the movie also has some unnecessarily added tragedies, (like Bridges' kid) however all in all this movie does have a great message about how Seabiscuit's triumphs won the hearts of depression-weary Americans and America itself. The best scene is the ending narration and shot. If you dont have anything better to see or do, than this movie is for you!
B00005JM02|4.0|I thought &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; was very good. The animation is fantastic - realistic, which is typical of Pixar. The storyline was good, and the characters were, for the most part, great. Dory, the fish with a short-term memory problem, was hilarous! The pelican, too, was very funny. I can't see how kids can help but love this charming movie. Even many adults will enjoy it, even if only for the wonderful colors, animation, and humor. Very well done Pixar!
6305907145|3.0|While Frances O'Connor's Fanny Price is not Jane Austen's Fanny Price, she is a delighful girl none the less. Actually, the film Fanny Price is much more likeable than Austen's character, who never could have carried a movie on her own, being too pious and self-effacing, and in my opinion, downright dull. &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is obviously not my favorite Austen! However, the book deserved better than the socio-political tract that the director was determined to make it into, with historcially inaccurate references to slavery, and a hint of lesbianism. The book was set at a time in British history where the slave trade had been outlawed for several years, and so it would have been impossible for Fanny to have seen a slave ship discharging slaves off of the coast of England. There was nothing in &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, the book, to suggest in any way that Mary Crawford was bisexual, although I can accept a defense that the director was trying to portray her as an amoral woman who would try to seduce anyone just to see if she could do it.<br />To my way of thinking, the best part of the movie came when Fanny was ordered to return to her birth family by her uncle (a deliciously creepy turn by Harold Pinter). After living in the comparative luxury of Mansfield Park since she was a young girl, O'Connor's Fanny is repulsed by the squalid conditions she finds at her old home. Her father (who seems to take a more than slightly unfatherly interest in his lovely daughter)is a drunkard, and her mother is harried and slovenly. It was a stroke of brillance on the part of the director to have the same actress portray Fanny's mother and aunt, who were, after all, sisters.<br />Even though the movie is not Jane Austen, and the politics of the director are hardly subtle, I still think the movie is worth viewing, primarily for the performances of O'Connor and Pinter. I think if you just try to forget that it is an adaptation of a classic work of English literature you will find the movie to be much more enjoyable.ind the movie to be much more enjoyable.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As a huge LOTR fan, I was eagerly awaiting the third film, as well as the third soundtrack.  The Fellowship soundtrack is probably one of my favorites of all time.  Now I think ROTK's has taken its place alongside Fellowship.<br />The soundtrack has great variety- starting off wistful with &quot;A Storm is Coming,&quot; moving on to triumphant and grand with &quot;Minas Tirith&quot; and &quot;The White Tree,&quot; which  both contain Gondor themes, and then on to downright scary with &quot;Minas Morgul.&quot;  This continues throughout the CD.  My favorite tracks are the ones at the end, because they seem to me to be the most moving- &quot;The Black Gate Opens,&quot; &quot;The End of All Things,&quot; &quot;The Return of the King&quot; and &quot;The Grey Havens.&quot;  Howard Shore expertly weaved all of his themes from the previous movies into this one, such as the Fellowship theme, the Mordor theme, the Rivendell theme- even hints of the themes of Boromir's death and of the breaking of the fellowship.  My only complaint is that there are some good pieces of the score missing from this soundtrack, but that's to be expected with a 3 and a half hour movie.  A must-have for all fans of film music and Lord of the Rings!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of Jane Austen's &quot;Persuasion.&quot; Unlike some other reviewers on this site, I found Amanda Root to be a perfect choice for the role of Anne Elliott, who had &quot;lost her bloom&quot; at age 27. At the beginning of the movie, Root's Anne is timid, often self-effacing, and her physical appearance is, frankly, plain. Thoroughout the course of the film, as she rediscovers her feelings for Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds)she becomes more animated and self-assured, and by the end of the movie, sure of the captain's love, she positively blooms again. I liked the cast in general, although I thought that Hinds may have been an older Captain Wentworth than Austen envisioned. Corin Redgrave gave his usual excellent performance as the vain and foppish father of Anne and Elizabeth. I did not care for Phoebe Nicholls interpretation of Elizabeth Elliott, however. Ms Nicholls, who was so brilliant in &quot;Brideshead Revisited,&quot; played Elizabeth (who is in her late 20s) as a spoiled teenager who would have been more at home in the Los Angeles of the 1990s than early 19th century England. Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma) and Fiona Shaw were outstanding as Mary Musgrove and Mrs. Croft, respectively.<br />The film makers did take some liberties with the story....it has been commented on several times by critics that Anne and the Captain never kissed in Austen's novel. While this is true, most of the film adaptations of Austen's works that I have seen include scenes of kissing between men and women who have come to an understanding of their love for each other. &quot;Persuasion&quot; is certainly a more faithful adaptation of Austen than is &quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; which was released about the same time, probably because it does not have a political ax to grind.
0684869713|5.0|A lot of the reviews I read have not read the book carefully and made errors when describing it, and just like to repeat what critics websites say so here's why you should give the Fountainhead a shot:<br />The Fountainhead tackles two great themes worth of attention, integrity and 'sense of life.'  Roark is the shining example of integrity throughout the book, making hard choices but they are the right ones.  He is an individualist, because he knows what is right and sticks with it despite what the rest of society may want him to believe and do.  The 'sense of life' theme is even more interesting than the first.  The whole book is first a battle between seconhanders like Peter Keating and Roark, but more importantly it is a battle between the intelligent people (Dominique and Gail) that are also cynical and do not think good can succeed in this world (can they learn to love life? read it).  It is a story of a hero, one with integrity, purpose and a good outlook on life.  If a man such as this is something you value, the Fountainhead has something to offer you in an action-packed book that has the philosophical insight to back it up.
B00005JKES|5.0|superb acting, superb casting, wicked scenes, dialogs, everything.  Throws all other series ever produced  back to the stone ages.  Lynch is a master in dynamics-in-stillness, where lesser minds don't even get to the point of realizing that there is no way of making any kind of dynamic scenery without a definite stillness or eternity in it, acting as a qualitative filter throughout the dynamics.  <BR>The power lies in the perfect unfolding of the scenes.  It is as if it is always been there, as it should be<BR>RELEASE SEASON 2 SOON PLEASE !!!!!!!!!!!
B00008OM7U|5.0|The Lords are all over the shop.  The second IRS record by the band, it moves more into many genres sonically and romantic, if sometimes necromantic imagery lyrically.  This one is least like the new 2003 incarnation of the band fronted by StevenMarque; but you can hear Stiv's influence on him on tracks like BAD TIMING and TALE OF TWO CITIES.  Like any other LORDS album, a meaningful masterpiece and certainly significant theosophically, against the backdrop of most 80's vibrant/vapid offerings.
B000002JPA|5.0|I'm just filling this out to improve my reccomendations; however, this album absolutely rocks.
B0000CNY27|4.0|This film is based on a terrific idea. It's the future, see, and New York has been walled up and turned into a maximum-security prison. If that concept doesn't grab you, you won't enjoy this cult classic.<br /><br />If it _does_ grab you, you're probably part of this film's target demographic. So here's what happens: the President (Donald Pleasence, of all people, and he's terrific in the role) has ejected from Air Force One and gone down somewhere in New York. He's being held prisoner and somebody is going to have to rescue him. Fortunately, war hero and convicted felon Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell) is on his way there as a prisoner, and maybe in exchange for a full pardon he can be induced to save the President's butt. If he doesn't succeed within 24 hours, two bombs implanted in his arteries will kill him.<br /><br />This is a great action flick with lots of atmosphere, and it's got the tremendously underrated Kurt Russell, in the film in which he finally shucked off his Disneyfied past. And it's directed by John Carpenter, who is uncannily adept at turning out a fine movie on a budget of about twenty bucks.<br /><br />Frank Doubleday as Romero sets the tone for this particular vision of New York; from his very first moment on screen, he pretty much shows you what the city is all about in this dark future. Ernest Borgnine is charmingly droll as the Cabbie, Lee Van Cleef is Lee Van Cleef, and Adrienne Barbeau is both sharp and beautiful. And Isaac Hayes is even cooler here than he was in _Truck Turner_, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The atmosphere is very dark and gritty and vaguely apocalyptic, brought to life with help from a memorable score by Carpenter. Russell brings Plissken to life perfectly. And the film has lost none of its anarchic/antiauthoritarian edge. Great, classic piece of Carpenteriana, as enjoyable today as it was in 1981.<br /><br />Since writing this review originally, I've also bought the two-disc Special Edition, and it's well worth the money for the fine DVD transfer and nifty extras.ty extras.
0385504209|4.0|I found this book an excellent weave of fiction and fact (stress on the fiction). Dan Brown takes some known facts and many grey areas with room for interpretation to weave a tale of intrigue while touching on some of the more controversial topics.  The book should be read as a story....nothing more!<br />I found the ending a bit contrived but overall this book was a great way to open my eyes to the more factual books/research on this topic that are not as exciting on the first pass for the ignorant ones like me.
B00005JLYW|1.0|My wife and I just rented this DVD.  It is simply the worst DVD we have seen all year.  There simply is not a plot.  It really isn't even a story, just a bunch of poorly done computer special effects scenes.  I am personally a huge fan of these gifted actresses, but this was just a pathetic movie.  Don't waste the 2 hours of your life, nor your money, on this very poorly made &quot;film&quot;.
B00004STUL|1.0|One of the worst action movies of the 90s. The dialogue by Lawrence and Smith is so God-awful that I had to turn this film off halfway through. Given how great of an actor Will Smith is, it hurts me to be so negative, but his acting is almost as bad as Lawrence's, even for a Bruckheimer production.<br /><br />If you like completely ridiculous movies with plots that are extremely far-fetched, but have lots of crap blowing up, and the sound on your TV is broken, you may enjoy this film, although I'd advise you to rent Armageddon instead.<br /><br />As far as the Special Edition DVD goes, I actually own it (gift), and it is far from \\"Special.\\" The features that are on the special edition should have been included on the original edition. Beside a decent special about how they do the action sequences, everything else on the second disc is pretty boring.<br /><br />In terms of the actual DVD, it was average, but nothing too special. The \\"talent files\\" and \\"production notes\\" are simply still images of the main cast that lists their resumes. Not very useful, but not bad to have either. The Michael Bay commentary is decent, although it would have been nice to have more than one person on it. Commentaries are more interesting when you have someone else asking questions or bringing up things the director might have forgotten. It would have been nice to include a commentary with one of the lead actors with Bay. The special effects featurette is very short and not that interesting. It's your standard \\"here's how we made stuff blow up\\" featurette.
B000002H38|5.0|Rapture is one of the greatest soul records in history.  Anita Baker had the hits and the voice to match.  Every single song is a masterpiece and Baker knocks it out the park in terms of vocals.  The melodies are sophisticated, memorable, and timeless.  Eighteen years after the release of this gem, and it still sounds new and intelligent.  Amazing soul represented here.  You don't hear songs like these (with the groove) nowadays with so many nonsense singers with limited talent and beat-driven albums.  My favorites on this album include Sweet Love, Mystery, Caught Up In The Rapture, and No One In This World.  This album is a complete masterpiece that up &amp; coming singers should study.  Easily 5 stars. The only word that comes to mind is MASTERPIECE.
B000099T3P|3.0|I remember renting this movie with a friend when I was around ten years old, and it was a lot of fun and scary as hell. Unlike some of the other horror movies that featured monsters or aliens as the nemesis, the concept of Critters was pretty original, and although it's not award material, it's a pretty decent sci-fi/horror film.<br /><br />Don't go into this thinking that it's another \\"Leprechaun\\" or \\"Jack Frost\\" type of film. The film isn't about gore and despite the absurdity at how the Critters look on the cover, they are pretty scary in the film.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|As a child, I loved Christmas music, so I was just a lad when I first looked forward to the day there would be a Whitney Houston Christmas Album. As I grew older I saw some of Whitney's contemporaries make Christmas albums. Mariah Carey made one at the height of her carrier, and it showed. That album is a classic with some of the best renditions of the best Christmas songs. As the years went on and I became a man I saw Whitney's carrier decline, and was saddened by choices that she made in her personal life. Now, in my golden years, Whitney has put out the album I longed for when I still had teeth. Now I have Whitney and Mariah's albums, one a Christmas classic recorded in the singer's prime, the other, trite and completely forgettable- coming after years of decline and personal abuse, as she tries without purpose to mock other, much younger, trendy singer's of our day. To say she turned her back on her core fan base would be a shallow analysis, as her 180 goes so much broader and deeper. I would recommend you stay away from this recording, like you should stay away from any ship without a rudder, moving steadily toward jagged rocks and certain doom.
6305841861|4.0|Although there is a lot in this film that doesn't make sense, it's a great remake of the orginal Evil Dead (yes, it's a remake, not a sequel).  I think Raimi could have tempered himself a bit with the f/x sequences, as some are a bit overdone. It seems like he was interested in using every bit of his budget, regardless of whether a scene needed it or not.  But it does make for an entertaining piece. Campbell's performance is brilliant.
1577311523|5.0|After reading many many books by several empowering authors such as Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dalai Lama, Marianne Williamson, and Tiffany Snow, that I am still reading, my life has opened up to me in such a compelling and wonderful way. This new book is well written, and thought provoking. There are great transforming authors, who shift the consciousness of humankind in a way never known before. The &quot;Power of Now&quot; is one of those.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I was really excited to hear one of my favorite books was being made into a film. I was surprised at the beginning whenn they didn't say &quot;based on the book.&quot; After watching it, I can see why. The only thing it has in common with the book are the characters and some of the first 5 minutes. The plot is completely different. The book is exciting because Jason Bourne (Damon) is up against the deadliest assasin of all time, Carlos the Jackal, and his origins are a mystery until the very end. Carlos is nowhere in this film, and the secrets of the organization Bourne is from is revealed in the first 15 mins.<br />Another thing that I haven't seen in over a decade, is a very anti-climatic ending. No real final showdown with the bad guy, no incredible revelations, just an action scene that's less exciting than the first fight Bourne has.<br />As a standalone film, it's entertaining. As a book adaptation, it's horrible.

B00003CY0V|4.0|This is another one of those movies that's best to see for pure enjoyment. I had read a lot of reviews about it beforehand, and that it wasn't very good, so I was hesitant to see it.<br />I was pleasantly surprised though when I walked out of it. The opening action scene is one of the best I have ever scene and really gets the film going. It's one of the first uses of &quot;matrix-style camerawork&quot; that I've seen that really adds to the film and isn't just something that &quot;looks cool.&quot; The first explosion is incredible and by the gasps in the audience, most of the people in the theater thought so as well. The chase scene in the film is pretty spectacular as well.<br />The hacking part of it is a little absurd, as are most movies involving hackers, but Jackman is a very convincing actor.<br />One of the best things about this film is the originality in it. The plot isn't the greatest to come along, but it takes an original turn at terrorism.<br />As with many thrillers, the ending of this film has a twist, fairly similar to &quot;Wild Things,&quot; but my only problem was that I had no real clue what was going on after the movie ended, as did most of the people in the audience. We had to talk it out to figure out what the ending was really about, and IMO&lt; this could have been explained a little more thouroughly.

B00000G3PA|3.0|This has got to be one of the corniest and sappiest movies I've ever seen. Even if you don't mind the extreme camp value of it, the scenes of young children running around dressed as astronauts and playing with space shuttles was too much. the film is filled with factual errors and flaws that look as if the producers just didn't even care.  I'm perfectly capable of suspending disbelief and enjoying a science fiction movie, but Michael Bay seems to be under the school of thought that more explosions/drama = better movie.<br /><br />The above being said, I like Bruce Willis. I like Liv Tyler. I like movies about space and the end of the world.  If you can get around all of the absurdity in this film, and just enjoy it for the action-filled special effects-laden popcorn movie it is, it does have some redeeming value.  However if you only have time for one \\"big rock hits earth\\" film, skip Armageddon and watch [[ASIN:B002DMJLTE Deep Impact [Blu-ray]]] instead.  More plausible, better acting, and an amazing shot of a huge comet entering Earth's atmosphere.  Although Armageddon is definitely not the worst movie ever made, it certainly is one of the most ridiculous.

B00003CXTG|2.0|If you thought Armageddon was cheesy, wait until you see Pearl Harbor.  It's almost as if Michael Bay just said \\"how can I do everything I did wrong in Armageddon, and multiply it tendfold?\\" They really should have cut everything around the fight scene and just shown that. I've never seen something in such desperate need for editing.  The plot went on and on, and the love story was dull and cookie-cutter. It wasn't a decent love story like in Titanic, it was a miserably boring and uninvolving story about two people you don't care about.<br /><br />The only redeeming qualities of this film come from the special effects on the attack of Pearl Harbor.  If they had just cut out all the other stuff and left this in, it might make for a nice Discovery Channel special.  As a feature-length (and more) film that is supposed to keep you entertained for 3 hours, it leaves very little.
076790592X|4.0|After reading many many books by several empowering authors such as Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dalai Lama, Marianne Williamson, and Tiffany Snow, that I am still reading, my life has opened up to me in such a compelling and wonderful way. This new book is well written, and thought provoking. There are great transforming authors, who shift the consciousness of humankind in a way never known before. Tuesdays with Morrie is one of those.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|\\"Wah, wah, wah, unoriginal, derivative, they sound the same.\\" Whatever, this album has a much tighter sound and identity and almost every single song is excellent. Especially listen to Reptilia, Under Control, What Ever Happened?
031286504X|5.0|I must confess, after reading a few chapters I believed this novella was another parable about the HUAC and McCarthy's political reign of terror. This story was written in 1954 and a similar theme: the lone individual standing up to hysterical mobs that sprouted overnight, had been addressed in films such as &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (based on a Finney short story).<br />However, when I finished the story, I was convinced that a previous reviewer made a more accurate assessment. _I Am Legend_ is a pure existential novel, along the lines of Camus's _The Plague_ and _the Stranger_.<br />Robert Neville is the _involuntary_ and rather pathetic, disempowered survivor of a plague that transformed the human race into a race of blood-sucking vampires. The plague also took his wife, daughter and best friend.<br />Every night his former friend leads a small group of vampires who torment Neville and remind him he is less than a man and not much more than a cornered animal. In his alienation, despair and anger Neville sinks deep into drink and kills vampires during the daytime wherever he finds them sleeping and vulnerable.<br />In a sad episode, the lonely Neville, desperate for companionship, reaches out to a stray dog.<br />Neville, much like an addict, finally hits rock bottom. He resolves to overcome his ignorance and the centuries of superstition and scepticism that helped the plague spread. He studies science to understand the rational causes of the plague and the vampires.<br />In the process, Neville empowered by knowledge--alone but no longer lonely--understands himself, the vampire and the new culture of fear and violence of the ascending specie. Neville  accepts reality for what it is and determines to play the hand he has been dealt. He loses his fear of death, an inevitability and a constant in the human condition.<br />Neville, in a deft touch of irony, realizes that by _choosing_ to transform himself into a sober, deliberate, understanding and fearless individual, he has acquired the very qualities that make him an outsider in the newborn, conformist order.<br />Yet, he realizes he is the better man for it. This existential man accepts and courageously confronts his fate, the common fate of all mankind,  and in turn bequeaths to the new masters of the earth the unique gift he has discovered within himself.<br />This Nietzschean transformation makes Neville more than a man, he becomes a legend.<br />Ordinarily, the horror genre does nothing for me. After two pages of Stephen King, I set the book down. I much prefer the romance of SF, from _The Time Machine_ and _The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_ to _Childhood's End_ and _Ender's Game_.<br />Who would have thought that in the vampire genre, by definition stories of cold, dead blood-suckers, one would find a touching story about the promise of the lone individual being open to life's existential possibilities? Matheson deserves high praise for his accomplishment.<br />_I Am Legend_ deserves to be read--today, now, here--where, frankly, a disempowered citizenry is spooked into silence, anger and withdrawal by (unnaturally propagated) fears of the so-called &quot;War on Terror.&quot;rstanding and fearless individual, he has acquired the very qualities that make him an outsider in the newborn, conformist order.<BR>Yet, he realizes he is the better man for it.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|This was a terrific movie... I'm surprised that so many found this to be boring. Maybe a lot of us have a limited attention span and need constant fireworks in order to be entertained
B0000AFQS0|5.0|A few years ago I purchased the VHS of this terrific documentary about the world's greatest rock band only to discover that it had been edited and that the quality was less than great. All of that is fixed with this stupendous DVD restoration of the film to its original glory! The footage that was cut, like the tremendous performance of A Quick One While He's Away has been fully restored, as has the sound and color quality of the film. This documentary of The Who at their most explosive should be required viewing for all fans of rock music. The quality of this DVD version of the film is terrific and you'll want to listen to it VERY LOUD! Many great performances and rare clips were collected for this documentary, including early TV performances in the US, UK and Germany, early promotional films and explosive performances like Woodstock and those filmed specifically for The Kids Are Alright. Fascinating interviews with the band are interspersed throughout.<br />The disc of extras is a wonderful bonus that includes great recent interviews with Jeff Stein and Roger Daltrey, multi-camera angle views of the performances of Baba O'Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again, isolated bass tracks of The Ox playing on the aforementioned two tracks, a tour of locations important to The Who in the early days, and more.<br />If you are a long-time Who fan you will rejoice to see the film looking and sounding this good again. If you are a newer fan who has never seen the astounding force of The Who at the peak of their energy, then you absolutely must see this version of The Kids Are Alright! Thank goodness Jeff Stein didn't let his film fade away, it is a treasure for all Who fans that are now and are yet to be. He has preserved musical magic, hopefully for many years to come. Without this film, future fans probably would never believe that a rock band could be this good in live performance. You must see The Who to believe it. Long Live Rock!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw Wicked with my family in late November (the 15th to be exact). It instantly became my new absolute favorite musical! I was crushed when I found out that the CD would not be avalible until the middle of December. I threw the money at the register and signed up for pre-order. I was relieved by how alike the voices sounded compared to the Musical (a big problem is that often some musicals potray a different sound on the CD). I was floored by Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel's fabulous voices and felt I was back at the Gershwin playhouse. At last, justice to the Wicked and equal justice to the good. I also reccomend the book, that's what the play is based on (Wicked, by Greg Maguire), which leaves us with a question, is evil a trait, a facade or something else?
B0000AKCLS|1.0|It's all covers, and he doesn't bring one of them alive. I don't think he felt one emotion while recording this other than &quot;I wanna be a star.&quot; On &quot;Burning Hell&quot; I really wonder if he even understands the lyrics. He's certainly never thought about them.<br />And he can't sing. Just one note at greater or lesser volume, low growly pseudo-Gregg Allman. There are better vocalists in bars all over town no matter what town you live in in the USA.<br />The guitar-playing is meant to show off, but there's no dynamics, no sense of building a solo or starting slow and ending hot. He'll start out at maximum speed and have nowhere to go. You as listener are in big trouble then. <br />I bought this from Amazon reviews and actually listened to the examples and took a chance. Sometimes this works out, sometimes it doesn't. He's obscure for a reason. Maybe he'll get in somebody else's band and improve, but his instincts seem bad. It didn't seem like he was even listening to the rhythm section at times, and I'm not gonna forgive that if I paid good money for him. I've got nothing against the guy, but he's really not going anywhere.
B000084T18|1.0|Remember when music was about emotion? Well in case you don't, heres a hint.. life is not about prostituting women, being a pimp, getting rich, and being shot 9 times. His music has no feeling, its all an image. IMAGE! Doubtful any of you can relate to this. It's fluffy, somewhat catchy garbage fed to you by the media, and none of you know any better than to take it for the gospel. Please proceed to run far, far, away from 50 Cent the street-worn Gangster, sitting pretty in his billion-dollar mansion, and take a look at what a sucker would buy this crappy music.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|Tull fans are funny.  The band gives them a marvelous product such as the new Christmas CD and some (not all, thank goodness) still complain about this or that.  Stop your crying, already.  Your comments are ludicrous.  My favorite is &quot;It's mostly flute music.&quot;  That is so dumb I won't even justify it with a comment.  Also, all this talk about songs being &quot;phoned in.&quot;  What exactly does that mean?  What did you want them to do with these songs, add a full orchestra?  Perhaps the addition of the Harlem Boys Choir would have satisfied you.  <br />Take a look at the overall rating for this CD and decide for yourself if it's worth looking into.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Five stars.  I just don't think I have any more to add than that.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Sure, ALIEN is a masterpiece; it's what started this saga.  ALIENS was always a childhood favorite of mine, even though that damn Queen gave me nightmares.  ALIEN3, however, has slowly but surely become my favorite of all of them.  The 'special edition' featured in this boxset alone is worth the price of admission.  Forget ALIEN RESURRECTION; it should have ended with this movie.  If you're like me and consider ALIEN3 a magnificent standalone movie as well as great ALIEN movie, then you'll love this fully realized workprint version.  I have minor problems with it, ones I'd love to see fixed (re-release another DVD of just ALIEN3, Fox!):<br />1. Bring back the necessary actors to improve on the ADR that's kinda scratchy in some of the restored scenes.<BR>2. Update the CGI; get WETA or somebody to redo the alien and Ripley's suicide plunge :) <BR>3. Put back in the 30 minutes that was cut out of the 'Making of' featurette (for those of you who don't know, it was originally called &quot;Wreckage and Rape: The Making of Alien 3&quot;... go to digitalbits.com for more info)<BR>4. And don't forget.... DTS SURROUND SOUND!!!<br />Yeah, that'll probably never be done... but hey, who knows?  I'll keep my fingers crossed :)  Otherwise, I'll just watch all the discs in this boxset over and over (except RESURRECTION).  BUY IT TODAY!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have become accustomed to the fact that anything involving Joss Whedon will be excellent. This was certainly no exception. It was clever, witty and sophisticated. It was, sadly too say, too &quot;intellectual&quot; for the Fox executives to appreciate, what with the ever increasing &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the popular culture. And a tale with such promise was just getting started. <br />It is my impression that Fox wanted Joss to &quot;simplify&quot; the plot so the average moron out there could comprehend it. But Joss stayed with his vision and the show was dropped. A loss for all of us. But bravo Joss! Stick with excellence and you will be remembered long after these Fox executives are clipping coupons in their condos. <br />You have created in me, and in millions of others, a devoted fan of your &quot;thinking man's&quot; brand of fiction. Don't compromise. Leave mediocrity to the mediocre schlockmeisters -- there are plenty of them out there. But there is only one Joss Whedon.<br />Are there any impressarios out there with the vision and the financial clout to bring this back???
B000089RVX|2.0|I can't believe I wanted this so badly. The only good songs are &quot;Going under&quot; and &quot;bring me to life&quot;. I was so exited about &quot;My Immortal&quot; because of how it sounded on the radio. Here, it sounds like Amy had a bit to much weed and was tired. I hate it when bands have a radio version and a CD version.<br />Not worth the money. <br />The other songs are so raspy and dry they would burn easier than californias forests.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is robably the best Britney album. It has a different variety of songs all in different genres. Pop, rock, dance R&amp;B, Hip-Hop etc. It is also one of the best albums of 2003. The best songs are: Everytime, Toxic, Boom Boom, Showdown, Outrageous, Breathe on me, Shadow and Brave new girl. The worst song is prbably Early mornin' which Moby produced. You should get this album cause it's the bomb!
6305508550|4.0|This whole movie had me rolling on the ground laughing with tears in my eyes. The boss was so funny. He reminds me of one of my honors english teachers back in school.
0446608955|4.0|I saw the movie first and I thought it was sad but the book made me cry too!  It was really good!  I wish I had read the book first b/c the story in the movie is a bit different.  What a great story, even tho it's a bit &quot;cheesy&quot;.  Definetely worth reading if you want to cry!  It will only take about 2 hours to read this book - so sit down and get started.  You'll want to read it again, just so you can cry over it again.
B0000039QA|3.0|...And hell is hot much like this posthumus effort by Biggie. This album is by no means a classic. There's a lot of throw away tracks and the production to some of his most quotable lyric is not good at all. Biggie has some pretty dark and honest songs on this that are both deep and believable but most of these are little too poppy and geared towards the general masses instead him just being him. Biggie lacks some of the wit, charm, and clever word play that he had on Ready to Die.  <br />The highlights of this album are (In My Opinion):<BR> 1<BR>(1) Somebody's Gotta Die<BR>(3) Hypnotize<BR>(7) I Love the Dough<BR>(11) Niggas Bleed<BR>(12) I Got a Story to Tell<BR>2<BR>(1) Notorious Thugs<BR>(2) Miss U<BR>(5) Ten Crack Commandments <BR>(8) Sky's the Limit<BR>(9) World Is Filled...<BR>(10) My Downfall<BR>and the last track You're Nobody Til Somebody Kills U
B000002GBD|5.0|If there were a museum that showcased the most essential albums in hard rock, Nazareth's &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; would surely be behind a glass display case. It streamlined all of the important aspects that characterized the genre; gritty, riff-driven rock and a great level of accessibility. The album is full of talking-guitar techniques, powerhouse structures, and most importantly, a flexibility that is rarely found in most heavy metal albums: ballads that meant something and rockers that meant even more. Nazareth was one of the few bands that could pull off an equal balance of driving rock and power ballads that didn't sound overdone and empty. For instance, it's hard to find a band that could execute the anthemic title track, then craft a ballad such as the rendition of 'Love Hurts.' (It's a shame however that the power-ballad category would be turned into nothing more than a musical joke in the next decade, due to acts like Poison, Whitesnake, or Warrant.) Some more interesting moments are found in 'Rose in the Heather,' the doom of 'Miss Misery,' and the paranoid closer 'Please Don't Judas Me,' one of the songs that shows that not all songs associated with the word 'experiment' are wastes of time. All told, &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; is an essential piece of rock music, the blueprint for many acts to follow.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I really can't fathom why people don't give Radiohead the props they deserve for this album. This is very consistent. There really isn't any bad moments nor really is there any great moments like on OK Computer and Kid A (I.E. Pyramid Song - Tear jerkingly beautiful), just all around Radiohead goodness. This is way better than their previous album which was still a solid effort in its own right. Like all Radiohead albums you have to listen to it 4 or 5 times before you catch on to the brilliance of it all. I don't see why people try an overanalyze Radiohead musically and lyrically. Just listen to them for their sound and the composition of the songs. Radiohead's sound is distinctfully their own. An A- effort.
B000060P79|5.0|THIS IS AN AMAZING CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE PUT IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE LYRICS ARE WELL WRITTEN AND EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE MUSIC IS GOOD... AND WEATHER YOUR A PUNK FAN OR NOT, YOU HAVE TO LOVE THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S A LAW!!!!!!!!!!! ME AND MY FRIEND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS CD FOREVER, AND WHEN WE READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS WE WERE APAULED.<BR>               SIMPLE PLAN ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Why couldn't Radiohead just make this disc 2 for a double album.<BR>Or just condense all the goodness from this disc into Kid A. An even better classic. B+ Effort.
B0000CFW87|5.0|My Mom bought Josh's First cd 2 summers ago and I fell in love with his voice. He puts so much passion, beauty, and love in his music and the song he wrote on his own &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot; is so amazing and beautiful this guy will be in this industry forever because he is so talented and has soooo much to offer I cannot bear to take the cd out of my Computer LOL!
B00004XONN|5.0|Pure Greatness. This is one of the only rock groups I listen to consistently. Pyramid Song and the whole vibe of this album is beautiful. Radiohead really change the face of rock music with this effort. An A+ effort, kid (no pun intended).
B000002TLX|5.0|I purchased this cd off Amazon not too long ago and I think it's great without a doubt I'm 19 years old so I don't remember alot of his earlier music but after going out on a limb and recognizing only a few songs on the cd I decided to purchase it.  I'm not disappointed with my choice at all this is a great cd that has been put together.  This cd is truely wonderful and if you like the whole romantic pop song sound you will deffinately love this cd. I strongly advise you to get a copy you won't be disappointed.
B000002UJQ|5.0|HEATHENS!!!! This is beautiful music. You don't have to have a biasness for Radiohead to like this album. One of the most intelligent and inspiring albums of all time. Get this, you won't be disappointed. A+, deserving of a 5 star rating.
B00005RFAI|2.0|ok so I liked a few songs but I wouldn't say the whole cd is worth it... I heard from a friend it was really good and I took her word for it. I shouldn't have because I only like 3 or 4 songs on this cd the rest of it is just painful to listen to thats why this cd gets 2 stars.  Sorry Pink, I expected better.
0679428895|5.0|An enjoyable, well written and well researched book gives an interesting insight into Roman engineering, science, business customs and daily life. Set in Pompeii, starting two days prior to the erruption is a story of love woven on a sound historical and scientific base (interestingly enough Plinius features in the story). Easy to read and enjoyable, albeit short (large print and double spaces are used to extend the number of pages to a respectable minimum for a book), a recommended read.
B00004SCX6|4.0|OK to all you people that are dissing her you have to like her more than you let on because look at that sales rank.  I just want to say that this album to me is definantly one of my favorites I love it... has alot of upbeat songs with catchy toons.  I got this cd when it came out my freshman year of highschool.  I might also be a little bias due to the fact that I listened to it when this whole situation with this guy was going on and it has happy memmories attached to it because of the fact that it reminds me of that time.  I really like it and i'm being honest i'm not going to sit and diss her as I buy her albums like the rest of you guys... If you have a problem with her image fine... but you obviously like the music because ya keep goioing out there buying her cd's.  I know when noone is around u close the door and turn up Britney Spears's songs but will never admit it. I say this is a worthy purchase I'll admit it haha...
B000002UJQ|5.0|this is simply the finest album i own. i adore radiohead, and some say that it takes a different kind of person to like them, but i tend to disagree. most would find it bizarre that my two favorite bands ever are radiohead and dave matthews band, groups on opposite ends of the musical spectrum. but they do have one thing in common- musical genius. of course this isnt a review of dmb. ok computer will grab you and hold you in from the first grinding notes of airbag through the final soothing licks of the tourist. in between, you'll find brilliance in every song. i would write entirely too much if i tried to highlight every song, so i'll leave you with this: there is no let down (no pun intended) anywhere in the album; it is perfect. i only wish it could go on forever, but i suppose thats where kid a and amnesiac come in.
B00005OM4N|4.0|OK I do like this cd but some of the songs it's more like shes talking or moaning with music in the backround and not singing.  Whats that about?  I do however, think that like her previous albums this does have some catchy toons...I just prefer she sing instead of moan in some of her songs... also I don't like the song &quot;That's where You Take Me&quot; or whatever that is.  but, like I said before I do like most of the other songs on it.  It gets 4 stars for that reason.
B00004YRQA|4.0|i like it it gets the job done but it is kind of pricey?
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This cd is really good I like it alot.  I'm glad that she decided to branch out and try somthing new while, at the same time keeping her pop style the same helping her sell albums 3x before.  The ballads done on this cd &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; are the best ballads she has ever done on any of her cd's.  I especially like &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; and the only song I really don't like is the number(9) track &quot;The Hook Up&quot; I find it rather annoying.  Another thing is yes, I do like the number(2)track I Got that (Boom, Boom, Boom&quot;) but I think it'd be better with less Ying Yang Twins and more Britney. So I give this CD 4 stars.
B0000DD7NL|5.0|I am completely stunned by this cd!  I really enjoyed Ms. Alicia Keys' first album, but i am so overwhelmed at her outdoing herself on &quot;The Diary...&quot; that i find myself putting this album on repeat 24/7 for the past few weeks.  This cd definitely has a more retro-60's-soul-style in it.  You can hear the influences of the past and it is much more gorgeous than any album i've heard lately.  My favorite tracks here are everything, 1 through 15.  Especially &quot;if i was your woman,&quot; &quot;you don't know my name&quot;, &quot;if i ain't got you&quot;, &quot;diary&quot;, and all the rest of them.  I won't list them all.  Go out and cop this album, NOW!!!!!
B00005JMGL|2.0|Written over 100 years ago, the latest version of PETER PAN is said to be closer to the original story than the beloved Disney film.  There has been several retellings over the years, but this one just didn't get off the ground with me.  Seeing a half naked boy flying around with a ferry and trying to kill people seemed more creepy than cool.  It also takes far too long to get to the meat of the film, and then seems to end shortly thereafter.  That being said, the audience couldn't disagree more.  \\"Excellent,\\" \\"amazing,\\" and \\"great,\\" were the words by the patrons as they left the screening.  So once again, don't take my word for it.  However, I believe that they may all agree that if you are going to see a pirate movie this winter, rent PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.  THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL was one of the few films to come out of 2003 that over-delivered!
B00005JM02|5.0|I loved this movie.  The animation was great as usual and I loved the storyline.  Right up there with the children's book &quot;Runaway Bunny&quot;, this is another story of a parent letting a child know &quot;wherever you are, I will find you&quot;.   The supporting cast is fabulous and I loved that Willem Dafoe is excellent as the veteran fish, Gill.  I was suprised that Eric Bana was the voice of Anchor the shark, just as he was making his debut as The Hulk!<br />Big laughs with Pixar favorite, John Ratzenberger, as the school of fish with a fondness for charades!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This CD is great, Beatles fan or not. Its just good rock and roll. I'm not ashamed to admit I'm 16 years old and have been a Beatles fan for all of them. In fact, most of my friends love the Beatles' work too. You aren't getting all of the Beatles unless you have this CD.
0671027344|5.0|I personaly am not a book reader so when my friend told me to read it i was a little hesitant. Seriously after the first chaperter i coulndt put the book down. I went through many emotional ups and downs and i was amazed that i was so deep into the book. I will say this and only this this book changed my life in so many ways.
0345457684|5.0|Imagine a world, where you won't die. You will just get into another body. And, if you are rich, you can even have your own clones, for each day of the week, for example. In such world, what is the point of murder? <BR>Why was one of the richest man on Earth murdered, just to be reborn in another clone? <BR>This is the question Takeshi Kovach is faced with, when he gets to Earth to investigate the case he doesn't want to. He is also faced with assasins, AIs, which gone a bit crazy, and a whole world for us to see and marvel at. <BR>\\"Altered Carbon\\" gives us a solid mystery, rooted in an interesting and well-realised future. And there is a lot of action thrown in, if the mystery is not enough for you.<BR>While some readers critisized the book for being too graphic in depicting sex and violence, I didn't have problems with those issues. Maybe I'm more tolerant, or maybe I thought that for the man like Takeshi this was the right way to narrate his story. He is a mercenary, who has been through several horrible wars - do you expect him to be poetic, while describing sex? <br />Overall, this book is one of the strongest SF thrillers I've read in a long time, may be since \\"Snowcrash\\". Buy it!
B0000E6I1J|4.0|I have been a very big beatle fan (i'm 37) ever since I heard my brothers LP of HELP...Anyway for the most part I have followed George's career throughout the 70's and  even buying the Gone Troppo LP (clearance center in Kmart $3.99 it wasn't that bad1)<BR>The cd and dvd are awesome, one of the best live recordings ever.  It covers the entire career of George Harrison. I believe the highlights I think are : The Inner Light, Old Brown Shoe, Horse To Water (great vocals and great song...)Something (awesome) While my Guitar Weeps and the ending is fitting I'll see you in my Dreams... A must for all Beatle Fans (better than Let it Be Naked) and a good start for the new fans...<br />Thumbs up..
B00003CXUM|5.0|This Chinese film goes back to the recent past of Hong Kong, China and the Chinese. The love affair is delicate but it is not the essential element in the film, except as a metaphor for change, for the changing world. In those years (circa 1963) the world was changing but within a divided pattern, that of the two blocks and we feel this behind the scenes. The Shanghai community in Hong Kong, a symbol of the change in continental China. The family going to the US to visit their grandchildren, a symbol of the attraction of the US in those days, but also of the desire to go away from continental China and the danger some thought it represented. The visit to Cambodia and its sacred temples, with de Gaulle's visit in the middle of it in 1966, brings up the phantom of the Vietnam War behind this historical period. The spouses working in Japan or Singapore or Thailand shows the development of Asia in those days, led by Japan as the great industrial and commercial power it was becoming. But we have to think of the present. Things have changed so much. Japan is no longer the leading power in Asia. Hong Kong has found its place in continental China. Shanghai is more attractive than San Francisco. Cambodia has rebuilt its unity and independence after the tragedy represented by the intervention of the US on its territory and the subsequent bloody episodes. Today the Chinese are not emigrating abroad any more. They have become the engine of the development of Asia. This vision of Hong Kong in the early 60s emphasizes this change and the film is like archeology. The love affair then is symbolical of this evolution : the spouses emigrating to other Asian countries and having a love affair there ; the young man visiting Cambodia or even further and coming back not to discover, by lack of courage, what happened to the woman, though the film tells us about the son she got from her liaison with him, is a symbol of the complete beaking up of human relations in that world ; the vision of the Temples of Angkor, a Buddhist monk there, and the man burrying his secret in a hole in the wall plugged up with some earth, is a vision of very old traditions, beliefs and even superstitions, a world that has mostly disappeared. Very nostalgic. And the film is systematically invaded with music from Brazil or other distant, non Asian countries and in some foreign language that has nothing to do with Hong Kong. A symbol of the uprooting of this community brought by the divided world, but also announcing the globalization of the world that was to come at the time and is in the process of emerging today. The slowing down of some scenes makes these scenes look like some old dream, or old recollection, look like a mnemonic vision of a past that has disappeared.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUf the Temples of Angkor, a Buddhist monk there, and the man burrying his secret in a hole in the wall plugged up with some earth, is a vision of very old traditions, beliefs and even superstitions, a world that has mostly disappeared.

0060194995|5.0|I waited a long time to read this book b ecause I thought it would be way overmy head, but suprisingly it was really easy to understand. It's a great book, though its not that long, you know all the characters very deeply. I think the most amazing scene is when after the verdict is read, Atticus walks out of the courtroom and all the people in the balcony stand up to solute him. It seems like such a powerfull statement. Read this book if you haven't because it is one that is truly great.
B00004BZ16|4.0|Sandinista! 36 tracks of pure punk fury.....huh.....what a minute.  Let me try that again.  Sandinista! 36 tracks of reggae, rock, jazz, hip-hop, disco, punk, pretty much everything except metal.  This album is a bit confusing, or I should say frustrating, because about 18% of the album is excellent, 37% is o.k., 26% could have been good, and the last 19% isn't even worth listening to.  I mean, the clash know how to rock, listen to police on my back or washington bullets, some of my favorite clash songs, but then you listen to look here and shepherds delight, and they are just awful. It sounds and feels like, the bad songs were just thrown together just to have a long album instead of good one.  The good ones on the other hand sounds like they sat down and took time to write a good songs.  True, true, some great songs were written on the spurt of the moment and I don't know how the clash wrote their songs, but this album came out one year after London Calling; and to write 36 songs in that amount of time is quite a challenge.  Nonetheless, this album does have it's flaws, does have some awful moments, but it also has some of the Clash's best work. Sandinista!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I thought that this was a great concert that brought many of his Friends together... One question though... Where was Bob Dylan? I liked My Sweet Lord By Billy Preston and Something sung By Paul McCartney... He seemed to struggle a little bit on Something, but I see this concert as part of the healing process for all of them and even us who miss George as much as they do...<br />I think that George would be proud of his son for helping keep the memory of George alive... His son seemed emotional toward the end, but this is the ultimate rememberance of a man who passed on too soon.... We miss you George!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Not everyone likes show music, and most show music aficionados over 60 don't really care for the music of Steven Schwartz.  But fans of Schwartz's previous soft-rock hits (GODSPELL, PIPPIN, etc.) will be in heaven over WICKED.  Some have complained that there is no synopsis of the show with the cast recording, but having seen this delightful show, I can understand why.  So much of the fun of WICKED comes from the plot's many unexpected turns and surprises and I wouldn't DARE give them away lest I spoil the fun for others.  It's generally agreed that the weakest element of WICKED is its score.  (That's not really true, as the choreography is truly dreadful.)  While this score isn't uniformly great, there are a lot of catchy tunes and the cast recording does preserve the delightful performances of Kristen Chenoweth (as Glinda the \\"good\\" witch) and Idina Menzel (as the \\"wicked\\" witch of the west).  Chenoweth and Menzel are THE leading divas of the new generation of Broadway stars and anyone with an interest in Broadway's future would do well to listen to these two sensational performers.  Chenoweth is a wonderful comedienne with a clear lyric soprano and Menzel has one of the best pop voices to come along since Barbra Streisand's debut 40 years ago.  My favorite cuts on the album are Chenoweth's \\"Popular\\" and Menzel's soaring \\"Defying Gravity.\\"  Joel Grey as the Wizard does nicely in his duet with Menzel \\"Wonderful,\\" too.  It's a shame that we don't get to hear much of the excellent Michelle Federan as the the wicked witch's sister, but that would be difficult to include without spoiling a major plot point.  This is not for everyone, but musical comedy fans should not deprive themselves of the many pleasures this CD offers.
0930289455|5.0|Batman's high-profile villains are actually Asylum inmates, and this should place them apart from most of comics' other foes; still, not all of those who wrote these characters have made the most out of this aspect. Alan Moore understood this: his Joker carries as much of a burden as does Bruce Wayne, even though both chose opposite ways to deal with the anger that resulted from it. But Moore plays down this opposition throughout the work, and not only in the conclusion. This is not a Batman readers are accustomed to, but there are two seemingly unrelated advantages to this: on one hand, Moore states explicitely many details that were mainly hinted at previously (especially concerning Batman's nature and motivations), so it's not as if he ignored what had been done before; on the other, this Batman is strange, peculiar enough to underline the fact that this book is the work of an outsider (or two, also counting Brian Bolland), of someone who has his own take on the eeriness of the characters and their milieu. Bolland's great work is in evidence everywhere, notably in the first few wordless pages featuring very evocative visual narration; and it's easy to understand why colorist John Higgins' name was included on the cover. In short, this is a Batman-Joker confrontation that feels fresh, inspired, dynamic and poetic at the same time.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This may well be the finest live performance ever put out on DVD or film for that matter. The moving and brilliant display is enhanced by high quality sound, exceptional camera work and editing. Eric Clapton is astonishing. He is well supported by a cast of legendary musicians who were all friends of George. This is a must for any lover of music. It is a classic.
B0000CDWQ9|1.0|Yes, folks...it sure looks like Warner Bros. is looking to get rid of a bulk of these DVDs, because they either made WAY TOO MANY OF THEM to sell-off to the consumers so they are unloading most of these bare-bones editions to make way for SUPER-DELUXE SPECIAL EDITION DVDs.<br />Without further ado, here are my ratings for the following films available in this pack -<br />Batman (1989): A<br />Batman Returns: D<br />Batman Forever: A<br />Batman & Robin: F<br />Ben-Hur: A<br />Blade: C<br />Blade II: F<br />Blade Runner: A<br />Bonnie and Clyde: B (Scenes drag, but Beatty & Dunaway are cool)<br />Bullitt: C (Yeah, I know it's a cool classic, but it coasts..)<br />The Dirty Dozen: A<br />Enter the Dragon: A<br />Eraser: C<br />The Fugitive: B (It lost some of its luster over the years..)<br />Full Metal Jacket: A<br />Goodfellas: A (This DVD is a flipper!!

B000002UUX|5.0|I listen to pretty much every single type of metal from Iron Maiden all the way to Suffocation.  And many of those bands haven't even come close to what Megadeth acheives on Rust in Peace.  Fast, techincal, intelligent; Rust in Peace IS the greatest metal album I have ever heard.  Starting off with Holy Wars....Punishment due, Rust in peace never stops shredding, from beginning to end.  All of Megadeth albums are brilliant,  mostly thanks to Dave Mustaine, the metal god, but Rust in Peace was the peak of their greatness.  To sum this up, for those of you who have never heard this album; if music was a bomb, Rust in Peace could blow up the solar system.  If the shredding of Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman was Hannibal Barca in the second Punic Wars aganist the Roman Empire than Carthage wouldn't had only won, but the great Roman Empire would have been erase for histroy.  Do you get my point?  This album is brilliant.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Most live CD's are so polished that they sound like studio albums with crowd noise piped in between tracks. The only reason to buy them is to see how the guitarist voices the songs with one guitar instead of studio overdubs (and many live albums have overdubs that ruin even that); however, 'Rush in Rio' captures a true live sound like no live CD (or album) I have ever heard since Kiss Alive. To get a live recording through the mixing board the band can jam with or without a crowd, and apart from possibly a bit more energy in the performances, what is the point. The liner notes claim a primitive Brazilian mobile recording truck captured the performance, but it also captured the ambiance of the massive soccer stadium full of 40,000 fans, the energy and excitement of a live show. I have been to over 100 live concerts (6 of them Rush) and if you close your eyes listening to this CD your ears hear what a live show delivers. Better yet, buy the Rush in Rio DVD and keep your eyes open!<BR>I did read one review below that complained of the sound quality. If you want a great sound quality recording, but the studio CD's. This CD gives live sound that was never meant to be clear as a bell. One very interest note is that at every concert I have ever been to, the mix is always a bit off on the first two or three songs as the sound people adjust for the arena and the given night. True to that, the first few tracks of this are the worst of the mixes, but again that is all part of the live experience. Rush rocks, makes us think, and amazes us that three men deliver such rich and dynamic sounds. My favorite band is great again. Thank you Geddy, Alex and Neal.<BR>PS If you read 'Ghost Rider' by Neal Peart you will have a much greater appreciation of his performance and presence on this tour.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Title: Freaky Friday <BR>Production: Walt Disney Studios, GUNN films<BR>Date: 2003 <BR>Length: 95 minutes <BR>Genre: Comedy <BR>Rating: PG (mild events and some language)<br />This movie is humorously entertaining. &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; is about a 15-year-old girl named Anna and her mom, Tess, who don't get a long. One night they go out to dinner for Chinese and a magic fortune cookie switches their bodies. Imagine if YOU and YOUR MOM switched places...AHHHHH! Exactly. That is what this movie is about. I reccommend all moms to see it with your daughter, and vice-versa. If I could give this movie a billion stars, I would!
B00007BH3Y|5.0|An exquisite backdrop to the marvelous novel by Michael Cunningham and movie. Tenured fans of Glass will immediately recognize his minimalist yet powerful orchestrations.<br />  Standouts include &quot;Morning Passages,&quot; where about four minutes into it the dramatic crescendos taper down to a winding piano octave that takes your breath away. &quot;Choosing Life&quot; is also a good one, in which the repeated delicate melody towards the end of the track lightens up the depression that the preceding 12 tracks have probably inflicted upon the listener by then.<br />  Overall, a valued recording for those who have seen the movie or who want a more accessible introduction to Glass's work, for nuances of the music in this soundtrack can be found in his other albums. Also reccomended of his: Glassworks. Buy this!
0767812166|5.0|&quot;Starman&quot; has long been one of my favorite films, I fell in love with it when I saw the orginal theatrical release, still loved it years later when it made the rounds on &quot;Movie of the Week&quot;, and now after all these years I still love it on DVD. You can find tons of films about love and about life from the stars but it's rare indeed to find both in the same film. I can only add my praise to that of the other fans of this beautiful film; great performances, great story, great soundtrack. I only wish there could've been more &quot;extras&quot; for the DVD release, otherwise &quot;Starman&quot; is the type of film that made Hollywood the &quot;dream&quot; capital of the world.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The seamless integration of nearly 45 additional minutes of footage satisfies (if not fully) the Tolkien purists critique of the theatrical version as not including certain scenes or characters from the book. The difficulty of capturing every minute detail from the book, to the script, to the film can be overwhelming. Such memorable scenes from the book added to this extended DVD version, such as the revenge of the Huorns of Fangorn (not to be mistaken for the Ents) on the Orcs of Isengard in the Battle of Helms Deep, the revealing of Aragorn's age and his Numenorean decent, to the &quot;special&quot; appearance of Old Man Willow (though not accurately portrayed in time and place) all adds depth and also integrates many of the extended scenes from Fellowship of the Ring such as Galadriel's gifts. Director Peter Jackson does a superb job in Two Towers. The commentaries, the behind-the-scenes footage and the conceptual artwork included gives us an additional 6 and half hours of playtime. This DVD extended edition is definitely worth the investment!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I'd have to say this is the best cd I have bought in a long time- the music is not repetitive and there are so many things to hear... And the lead singer? WOW!! <br />Truly ingenius music.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Let's make this short. This CD pretty much sucks. I was looking forward to the club style songs, and the kind of music that makes you want to get up and dance. But when i listened to it, i was disapointed, as all of the songs seem repetetive, with similar beats that dont really make you want to get up and dance. This CD is so much like her last one, it makes me wonder if she has any other talent then breathing hard with techno in the background. Although some songs have an ok beat overall, Britney has yet again put out a mediocre, pathetic album.
B00005JL78|5.0|This is a great film. Tom Cruise and Colin Farrel are awsome. The plot takes a few times watching to fully understand, but is very ingenious. The movie presents some very accurate ideas of the future and the story has nothing that would make absolutely no sense or just couldn't happen. The special effects are so real. The action is just awsome. Some really neat special features. Nobody hates this movie.
B00008J4P5|1.0|In my opinion, this band is musically challenged. For a drummer, it is insulting to be represented by a band like this. When I first saw them on Late Night With Conan O'Brian, all I could think was \\"this is probably the last time I'll ever see this group\\". This was less then a year ago. Now I turn on the TV and they're winning awards left and right that they don't deserve. As a dj, percussionist, and music fan, I think that the white stripes should be boycotted, to the point of non-existence. Thank you for taking time to read my review.
B00005JMGL|5.0|Ahoy, matey!  There be quibbles ahead!<br />They're not dangerous, says you.<br />Fair warned is fair armed, says I.  <br />Overall, \\"Peter Pan\\" is a delightful, beautiful presentation from Australian director PJ Hogan.  After the Sturm und Drang of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and hairball of \\"Cat in the Hat\\", this movie is very welcome.  No Hollywood comedian under formulaic siege from terrorist five year olds, as in \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" - a clone of \\"Daddy Day Care\\".      <br />Avast there!  Don't set your course for movies like that, matey.  See \\"Peter Pan\\"!  Pay attention to the rating, but I believe its okay for your little mateys older than 6.  After we saw it this morning, we saw it twice more today.  That's how much we liked it.  <br />The story most people know is from the Disney cartoon, or even better, the beloved, little fairy play written a hundred years ago by Sir JM Barrie.  Few today have read the original novel.  It reads like a bedtime story, told to us kindly, gently before we drift off to where dreams and Neverland are born.  It's funny and scary, full of children's nonsense; and yet, it lets wistful adults wink at it, too.  It is, also, a period piece of its time.  The play and novel, chained in Edwardian slang, societal roles, and conventions, do not translate well today.  Contemporary productions usually navigate these shoals and reefs to disaster.  <br />The eponymous reference is, of course, to the mythological god and shepherd of the forests.  By extension, he is a manifestation of the cross-cultural archetype of spring, the Green Man, who, dressed in leaves, comes from the forest to take his consort, a flower maiden, back with him.  Peter Pan is also a victim of contemporary pop psychology -- enough said there, but football widows will understand.   <br />The movie is a very close adaptation of Barrie's published and (recently discovered) unpublished Peter Pan material.  Like all adaptations, it is someone else's vision.  But, almost everythingin it is supposed to point back to Barrie somewhere.  They made this movie because they are passionate about the story and intended to film it retaining Barrie's spirit and imagination.  That has never been done before.  Also, this is the official centenary of \\"Peter Pan\\", and there are celebrations.  It also updates the Barrie material to fit current, albeit transitory, politically correct notions that may have compromised the producers' original intent.  A classic refreshes us; thereby, we give life to a classic, and this movie does that.  The production values, especially in design, costume, and effects, are first rate and created by enthusiastic, top-flight people.  It's good the story drives the effects, not the reverse.  The score, by James Newton Howard, is, by turns, sweet and poignant, jubilant and soaring.  It has a good cast, and their performances are solid.    <br />Jeremy Sumpter portrays Peter Pan.  He is a poster child for the revolution because an actress has usually portrayed Peter and still does in the musicals.  He combines the dashing qualities of Errol Flynn with the athletic flair of Douglas Fairbanks.  He makes a very credible Peter Pan, leaf-clad and grubby.  Sumpter invested a lot of his blood and tears in the role.  He is a teenage idol, too.  It was a good marketing decision, though one not without risk, to hire him.  <br />Sumpter does a very good job.  You can believe he is the fairy-enchanted youth of Neverland.  But, at 14 and 5'6\\" plus, some may think he is too tall and old for the part.  His changing voice and mild lisp dented the mood for me sometimes, though not for other people.  But, Sumpter brings to the role everything the actresses have failed at, and everything Barrie wanted, in Peter: courage, recklessness, deviltry, braggadocio, vulnerability, and tragedy.  That is no small task, and Sumpter carries it so well.    <br />Jason Isaacs' performance as Captain Hook may redefine the role.  This is a dangerous and seductive Hook, and a relief from the buffoon we usually see.  Isaacs' Hook is a menace, but he is a PG menace; and, that is all Barrie ever intended him to be.  The tweenie boppers may squeal for Isaacs as much as they do for Sumpter.  But beware, Isaacs portrays Hook with the same kind of evil seduction that favors Dracula. <br />Rachel Hurd-Wood, plays Wendy, facing the last night before she must leave childhood behind; for in those days, there was no adolescence in our modern sense.  Unspoiled by training or craft, she is, as described in the publicity, an \\"English rose\\" and very good.  Also, there is undeniable chemistry between Hurd-Wood and Sumpter that is charming and on key.   <br />But, the movie departs from the original's bittersweet conclusion that makes the story resonate still a hundred years later.  It is chapter-and-verse Barrie and defines the tragedy of Peter, who must never know love lest he lose Neverland.  From a published cast interview, casting notes, and photographs, we know they shot it and they said it was great; but they said the studio decided the filmed scene was too affecting and powerful.  For all the filmmaker's talk about capturing the deeper themes of Barrie's story, the studio chose the safer, weaker ending that merely ends the trip to Neverland but not the story of Wendy and Peter.  I hope they restore it on the DVD.  But, this is just my cynical quibble; you see, the 1924 silent film, a blockbuster of its day, didn't include that scene, either. <br />Then, should grownups by-pass this cove?  Belay the thought!  Just go, and take your inner child by the hand for the world is full of weeping.  Suspend your disbelief in fairies and boys who fly.  Let magic happen for you again.<br />But cast your weather eye, matey!  There may be broadsides.  <br />If there be, then repel boarders!<br />Watch your topgallants!<br />Come away, come away for a great -- but too brief - time in Neverland.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|For those boomers who were in college in the '60s and partied their way to graduation, you'll recognize many of the tracks from radio play of the day, garage band covers, and fraternity house record players. The great party songs are here. <br />Who can forget the catchy tunes &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;, &quot;Double Shot of My Baby's Love&quot;, &quot;Nobody But Me&quot;, &quot;Time Won't Let Me&quot;, &quot;Talk, Talk&quot;, and &quot;Pushin' Too Hard&quot;. <br />If you are looking for the 'Stones, Creedence, Doors, and the other mainstream acts of the day, they are not here. What is here is American rock music from the hard working, one or two hit wonders of the day. The heart and soul of the creative process starting in a garage and making it big for a year or two is what has been captured here. <br />As others have noted in their reviews, there are about 20-25 must have hits from this collection. While extracting my favorite 22 songs from this collection and buring to a single CD, I discovered the track index is off by one at the start of the second disk. Select the song BEFORE the one you want on disks 2 to 4 and straighten out labels on your copy.<br />Wonderful.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album has to be one of the best ever created.  APC is one of the most inovative bands I've seen.  Their music is just amazing and sounds great.  The lyrics and composttion are perfect, their sounds is like nothing eles.  It's so great to see a band like this.  I believe their CD was worth every penny I spent on it.
0679720200|1.0|This book brought me a chilling and troubling nightmare of what it means to live without hope, which according to Camus, is a positive expression of the freedom of pushing a mute rock up a hill forever in joy as he explicates in his discursive book, The Myth of Sisyphus.  But when a spiritual and religious person reads this 'fiction', she will recognize the truth that Camus' work never ceases to entrap itself in death-glorification, even, as in the final paragraph of this book, the stranger finds himself 'as having been happy and happy still', at the thought of the advent of his death, taking joy in the expectation (which, ironically, is a betrayal of Camus' conception of loss of hope as being a positive thing) of the spectacle of his death of execution and the jeers of the mob of spectators as they see him killed.  The 'protagonist' of The Stranger is a cold-hearted emotionless character, and throughout this whole book of 'fiction' he turns the stomach.  Read it only if you want to be that spectator of a man who willfully denies having hope, faith, and love, making a spectacle of himself for all to see, in that old literary post-modern fashion.  I didnt have any kind of guidance when i first read it, someone to tell me that to read Camus was a taking part in the spectacle of a hopeless death, which again, is a good thing for him.  He make take joy in hopelessness and the loss of God...Oh its such a twisted vision, one thinks.  What freedom it is to rebel against freedom!  How free must i be!!!!  So, in all seriousness, perhaps one could read it to be more informed about hopeless and selfishly joyful atheism, but only to use your criticism available and valuable to others who are truly inquiring into what life is and what it is worth, to expose the unfortunate cowardliness of Camus, The Stranger.
B0000024TT|5.0|In my opinion, Leonard Cohen is one of the greatest singer-songwritters ever and almost everything he has recorded is gold. You really can't go wrong with any of his albums but his 1968 debut &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; is a masterpiece. It is one of my favorite albums of all time. Every song is great and there are no fillers. &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; is Cohen at his best lyrically, musically, and vocally. The album is overall mysterious, dark, brooding, delicate, beautiful and paints strange and amazing pictures in the mind. I have never read anything about how these songs related to Cohen's life but there is no need because Cohen makes it all so clear and you can see and feel it all happening while listening to the album. I could go on and on some more about how great this album is but I will simply say this is essential, no matter what you listen to, it's just great music.
0060543981|2.0|My wife and I were delighted when our 5-year-old daughter received the CD version of Little House in the Big Woods from her godmother for Christmas.  Needless to say, the book is part of a series which is a timeless American classic, one which transports children to a world of simplicity and substance.  All in all, it's a wonderful antidote to today's culture of babble and hype.<br />Alas, from almost the first few spoken sentences my wife and I felt the voice of the reader was terribly wrong.  For starters,  Ms. Jones sounds as if she comes from the South, so the intonation just seems a little off-pitch for a story set in the north woods.  More importantly, in trying to articulate each word clearly, she seems to adopt a cadence that is simply too deliberate and measured.  Everything about her delivery sounds as if she's, well, reading a book - an old one, at that - rather than telling a story.  She rarely alters her cadence or pitch, so she seldom conveys any of the excitement or fascination of the material.  And in the places where the description itself may be a little too dry or detailed, she does little vocally to alter those problems.<br />We hate to be so critical, but my wife (a first-grade teacher) and I both were terribly disappointed.  Even our daughter, who is a keen listener, tired of the narrative after 15-20 minutes.  We expect she'll return to it, and we may be inspired to read it aloud ourselves - and hope to do a better job.<br />Perhaps we've been spoiled by Meryl Streep's various audio recordings, or perhaps it's just a matter of taste, but to our ears the Harpers editors/producers simply chose the wrong person or didn't give her good advice.  Surely Ms. Jones is a marvelous actress, but every week on the radio we hear any number of women reporters and readers who would breathe more life into this story.<br />In short:  good book, poor disc.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Just like the beer commercial, \\"It doesn't get any better than this...\\" and Josh's third album doesn't get any better than this!  I'm a Grobanite myself and I can't say enough how soooo in love I am with this album! I loved his debut album, but \\"Closer\\" is even better. The title says it all. Josh is getting closer to divine perfection. It's full of more passion, more emotion, and again it shows another side of Josh that hasn't been seen or heard of on his previous album. I have to agree with the previous viewer, this album leaves you wanting more. I still can't get enough of Josh Groban's breathtaking voice!     Here are some of my favorites:<BR>My Confession--This should be his next single! I love the lyrics and pop flare on this one.  \\"And I feel myself surrender each time I see your face.  I am staggered by your beauty, your unassuming grace...\\"<br />Broken Vow--This song just makes me cry because I broke up with my boyfriend a couple years ago.  The memories are still painful. \\"I'd give away my soul to hold you once again, and never let this promise end.\\" <br />Mi Mancherai--I love the violin on this one!!!<br />Remember When It Rained--Josh wrote the music and lyrics to this one. You even get to hear Josh play the piano on this track!<br /> When You Say You Love Me--This song just moved me to tears and gave me even more goosebumps. I hope to play this song at my wedding when we take our vows. \\"What could it be that comes over me?  At times I can't move.  At times I can hardly breathe.\\" <br />Per Te--It's another one Josh co-wrote.  I play that song over and over and over again!  Just breathless!  <br /> You Raise Me Up--That is getting to be his signature song! I expect to hear that at graduations, funerals, or awards ceremonies a lot these days.   <br /><BR>This album made me want to grab a hankie at the end because the songs are so powerful and meaningful in emotion and spirit.  I have never been moved by the power of music before, and after listening to JoshGroban's third album, I have to say it was sooo breathtakingly beautiful, it almost left me in tears. <br /><BR>So what's with all the negative criticism?  I think this album is worth it! God have mercy on all those bastards who gave this CD a one-star rating. This is probably the best Josh Groban album ever, and it just keeps getting better.  Keep it coming, Josh!  I love you!!!!!!! I'm looking forward to seeing you in Wichita in May!
B000127LW2|5.0|Star Trek: Voyager, the newest of the (as I call it) 3 sagaed series, taking place in the same basic year.  When Voyager first started everybody was unsure of how it would do.  Both Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation had a concept and actors that were extremely liked.  Not to mention Deep Space 9 was a completely new concept of a space station rather than a ship.  Voyager's biggest competition was The Next Generation with the ever popular Captain Jean Luke Picard (Patrick Stewart).<br />Voyager by far is the most unusual Star Trek series to date.  A single ship in impossible odds lost 70,000 light years from the nearest Federation outpost.  Two crews, Starfleet and Maquis, the noble and the terrorists.  Wow that's one way to start an incredible journey.  But wait not only are you involving terrorists on the most advanced star ship in the Federation, let's add their chief con officer Thomas Eugenie Paris to that...an ex convict.  But it figures even in another part of the galaxy not everybody agrees with Starfleet's ideals, 5 minutes in the Delta Quadrant and Voyager already makes an enemy, known as the Kazon.<br />Well I don't want to ruin this spectacular boxed set of Star Trek: Voyager Season 1.  Just wait their only getting warmed up. Remember Voyager has a great chance of reaching home with somebody like Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) commanding her.
0446530891|1.0|Virtually every plot element and twist in this book is just not believable, on any level.  Characters behave in ways unlike any person you've ever met.  Investigators jump instantly to completely unlikely, off-the-wall conclusions--that just happen to be correct. Secret Service agents act like total idiots.  Convenient coincidences appear by the dozen.  This book is an utter mess.
B00005JKZV|1.0|I'm not sure if it's just me but I found this whole series to be very boring and stupid.  <BR>I will admit that the special effects are good, but nothing amazing. <BR>The acting is fine, but not amazing<BR>The plot ok, but not super exiting<BR>     I can't seem to figure out why this trilogy is getting such great reviews.  The first movie was fine but nothing really that new.  And also after about an hour I found the hobbit's to be very anoying ( maybe it's all of the fake ears and feet}.<BR>So if you still must see this movie I would rent it.  Because  it's one of those super long movies that one viewing  will to te trick.  Or you could just read the book.... I know it sounds like a crazy idea, but you could learn some big words and have the story line built in!  Soif you want to buy a blockbuster dvd from last year..........Buy the matrix Reloaded
B00009V7P8|5.0|I picked this up on a whim, and whoa, was I ever blown away!  If I could ever make a cd with my feelings perfectly illustrated in music this would be it.  Aside from ruining my rock career, this cd dashes all of those in my collection!  Rarely are lyrics so beautifully woven into an actual... meaning.  There is more emotional truth and beauty in this album than any I have, or maybe even will hear.  The pure longing and soft tear in Rice's voice is enough to make you reconsider what music is about.  I'm a rock guy, but regardless of the style this music grabs, and shakes- like a good play it wrenches your emotional core, it did mine anyway.  After I bought it I was floored, nailed to my seat in a Green Room, and I literally could not move I was so touched, almost changed by the music.  It's not even the words, really as it is the intent: the truth in meaning, the moaning, the scratching that makes you say, DAMN!  Love is hard, and if you've ever felt it you'll feel this.  Pick this up, even if you don't like &quot;soft music.&quot;  If you're open minded enough to listen, this'll make you weap!-  And I'm a tough guy!  Thanks.

0345451325|5.0|The Fall of Reach (2001) is the first SF novel in the Halo series. In 2517, Lieutenant JG Jacob Keyes and Dr. Halsey inspected the final candidates for the SPARTAN II project. On Eridanus 2, candidate 117 is a six year old boy named John.    In this novel, John 117 and seventy-four other six year olds are initiated into the military worldview, learning teamwork and esprit de corps. They are taught a wide range of academic subjects as well as military skills. They are tested in field exercises with devious surprises and nonobvious goals. They are subjected to drugs and surgery to increase their strength and reaction time. The weak, slow and unlucky are weeded out through death and disability, but those unfit for combat are retained in staff and support positions. Those who complete the training are sent on missions against insurgents, pirates and other threats.     In 2525, an alien force attacks the Harvest colony. These aliens don't try to conquer the planet, but rather reduce it to slag. The aliens issue only one communication, in the human language, stating that the destruction of humanity is the will of the gods and that the Covenant is their instrument. This Covenant apparently comprises several different sentient species. Their vessels are superior to the Human warships, with better weapons and a form of reactive shield.    The remaining SPARTANs are immediately transported to the Damascus Materials Testing Facility on Chi Ceti 4. After their ship fights off a Covenant vessel, the SPARTANs are dropped onto the planet and taken deep underground to the MJOLNIR project area. There they are each fitted into their MJOLNIR armor and quickly trained in its use. Then they depart the planet to rendezvous with their transport, but the Covenant ship returns and they use their new armor to board and mine the enemy spacecraft.    This novel is a prequel to the Halo game scenario. It provides the backstory of SPARTAN-117, the Master Chief. It also tells of the first incursions of the Covenant into Human space, the subsequent battles in space and on the ground, and the eventual fall of Reach. It describes the fate of the other SPARTANs and the escape of the Pillar of Autumn into the system containing the Halo artifact.     This story is a vivid description of the deliberate modification by drugs, surgery and conditioning of a group of superior six year old children into awesome military tools. The original purpose of these super troopers is the suppression of discontent among the colonies by an autocratic government. However, the appearance of hostile aliens with far superior technology changes their roles from agents of oppression to the last hope of humanity.    This story also contains some interesting concepts in the formation of Artificial Personalities. It postulates two kinds of AI personalities, one with a large, but limited set of responses and another with an essentially open-ended learning capability. The first kind is stable and has a long life cycle. The second, however, is limited to a useful life cycle of about seven years.    This story has several flaws in the use of military ranks and customs. There is entirely too much saluting going on, for salutes are rendered even to noncoms. Moreover, there is a scene in which a Chief Petty Officer is saluted by two Lieutenant JGs and is apparently their commander. Of course, ranks and customs will probably change in the future, but the existence of commissioned and noncommissioned ranks indicate the existence of something like the present command structure.    Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys stories of military combat and super warriors.    -Arthur W. Jordin
B000089QEN|1.0|I'm so dissapointed at this period movie, it was badly cast, terrible music choice, and boring. Also it felt so disjointed from start to end. I truly purchased it cause the review says<BR>&quot;Adapted for the screen by Andrew Davies, who did the honors for the phenomenally successful Pride and Prejudice&quot; however it does not compare at all with the quality of Pride and Prejudice.<BR>It was so boring and disgusting, you are better off without watching it, you wouldn't miss a thing. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING IT.
B000002I25|5.0|This album definatly deserves its 5 stars. This is the CD that made me look back and discover old, great bands. I've already said on amazon that my favourite album today is the new trash metallers, Chimaira's 2003 release The Impossibility of Reason. That now can be my favourite Heavy Metal CD. I got their debut yesterday and didn't stop listening to it. I already knew the obvious, Break on Through, The Crystal Ship, Light My Fire, and the End. This album is better than Hendrix's debut! Seriously.. People say The Ultimate Experience is the most influencial debut of all time, Fair enough. But 'The Doors' is genius. One of my favourite songs on this CD is Soul Kitchen, I recommend it to any Doors fan who havent heard it. The song stays in your head all day. Its the most catchy song I've ever heard. 'Let me sleep all night in your..soul kitchen'.. Be warned, you won't stop humming those words after you've heard the song. I usually despise bands with Keyboards, but when I heard the Crystal Ship, I fell in love with the Doors. The guitarst Robby Krieger really shines on The End, an 11 minute amazing song. Jim Morrison's vocals are at his best on Twentieth Century Fox. Anyone who does not have this album yet, please, do yourself a favour, and pick this one up.
B0000DCGT1|5.0|A bit melodramatic (no more than the typical American movie), but an inspiring, feel-good, quality film for everyone.  A movie that doesn't require sex, nudity, violence, etc. to be a success (unlike the typical American movie).
B00005JM0B|1.0|EVER noticed how similar the two voices are - Garbo and Arnold?<br />Such missed fun - if only this director introduced a smattering of humor - like the opening Chippendales section with our Arnie and look-alike - ?  NOT that we want the missed Zucor Brothers - but it could have been such fun.... right?<br /> Then there's the femme fatale - except for the semi-Kama Sutra gyration near the end with Arnie - nuffin much here... and the heroinne?  The original miss was replaced 'cause she was slightly too young - Miss Danes {a superior talent wasted here - wasts her time on this milque-toast young'un]<br />Must add - great chase sequences though - the crane section - but like the metallic miss - it's all in the toilet from there on ....<br />Stick to Cameron's unsurpassed T2 - perfect - missing Linda H.
B00004TVG7|4.0|Pretty much everything that I can think of to say about this CD has already been said here.<br />I agree that it is a bit weird. I don't listen to it very often either.<br />But having said that my tastes in music are not so much driven by intellect, so it doesn't bother me that liner notes might not be as complete as they could be.<br />I bought this CD in Japan back in the mid-1980's when compact discs were still an upcoming trend and LP's dominated. It's believable but still somehow amazing that I paid the equivalent of more than thirty U.S. bucks for what is now practically a steal.<br />I also am wondering why the quality of this old disc is deterioriating. Yes! There are scratchy sounds abounding where studied silence was once 'heard.' Consequently, I listen even less than I would otherwise. (I had considered putting it on an MD with the soundtrack to 'Gladiator' and then listening to both on the 'shuffle' mode.)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't really care for the show when it screened on TV.  And so I only watched a few episodes.<br />But the DVD version has raised my opinion of the show substantially.  I think it has a lot to do with the pilot &quot;Origins&quot; episode coming first, rather that at the end of the season on TV.  Add to that the widescreen presentation, excellent sound, music, and detail:  it all adds up to a great show.  <br />And I hear it's scheduled to be made into a movie.<br />Sorry I missed this the first time around.
B000060P79|5.0|SIMPLE PLAN IS THE BEST BAND I HAVE EVER HEARD.  THERE CD IS AWESOME AND STILL GOING. YOU NEED TO BUY THIS IT TALKS ABOUT PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT HAVE AND CAN RELATE TO. IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHETHER YOU SHOULD GET THIS CD, WELL YOU SHOULD EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE PERFECT LIFE YOU CAN STILL RELATE TO IT NO MATTER WHAT. IF I COULD RATE THIS ANY HIGHER I WOULD GIVE IT 50 STARS!!!!!
B0000BWVCM|1.0|WELL?  This one's kind of a combo of &quot;Children of The Damned&quot; {the original George Sanders version} meets &quot;Inn of the 6th Happiness&quot; ~ except for the grand budget and flashy visuals - this one's similar to &quot;Peyton Place - meets David lynch&quot; , err now that has been done - right?<br />No, just enjoy the ride - the rest is plain vanilla [artificial vanilla] that is ......
0688163173|1.0|It is totally improbable that a staged event such as this, or any, would be allowed in a mental institution housing the USAs most violent criminals and then allowed to continue after 10 men were injured by the target! Get real.<br />Who's insuring all these employees against injury and death. How'd they get all the employees to play along, and act convincingly? Did they have rehearsals?  :o)<br />I liked one sentence. It described the string music playing in the background of a WWII german concentration camps'<br />commandant's office as \\"crawling around the walls like a spider. I could hear (given the state of audio in '45) and visualize the<br />creepiness of that room with the commandant setting there in his chair when Teddy broke in during the liberation of  the camp.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is the endearing story of a father fish named Marlin who raises his baby son Nemo only to lose him to a scuba diver.  Nemo is deposited in an aquarium in a dentist's office where he shares a tank with some friendly fish who are just as eager to return to the ocean as he is.  They encourage Nemo to help save them by risking his own life despite the fact that he has an undersized fin which makes swimming difficult for him.  Meanwhile his father has become friends with a blue fish named Dorrie who is absent-minded, and direction-challenged but totally loveable.  The two of them brave a variety of dangers in the ocean in order to rescue Nemo.  The production of the film is expertly done with beautiful colors and fascinating fish in the undersea world which the producers have created.  There's enough adventure to keep adults interested as they watch this film with their children, and it adds up to a delightful viewing experience.
B000084T18|1.0|This cd is terrible!If you wanna get a cd and actually like it then DO NOT get this one! It is the worst thing i have ever heard! It seems like all he talks about is trash... that you don't need to hear from someone, all he talks about is drugs and things about women that is totally offensive.  If i were you i definently would not buy this cd!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|When I first listened to the cd I wasn't really impressed to be honest....but. After watching the DVD and hearing Neil tell the story I can't seem to stop listening to it. Its truly one of Neil's best and I can't say enough good about it. Neil just seems to get better with age. Thanks Neil and Crazy Horse, keep on rockin!You are truly artists who play from the soul.
B00005JLD4|3.0|Rabbit Proof Fence is about three young Abrogine (the native people of Austrilia) girls living in Austrilia.  The goverenment takes them away from their parents to have them raised as &quot;civilied&quot; white people.  Unhappy in the camp they are sent to, the girls escape, outsmarting all of the trackers following them.  Their road to cross the 1200 miles of Australian Outback was a fence to keep rabbits from destroying farmland.  Through all of their adventures, they eventually made it home.  This was based on a true story.<BR> <BR>The story was okay.  The only problem was that the movie dragged out and seemed to go on forever.  I was very suprized that it was only 90 minutes long.  The director used cool camera angles, but they got kind of annoying after a while.  The soundtrack was composed by Peter Gabriel, and it was just plain scary.  It was mostly buzzing noises of bugs, and more often than not, drowned out the dialog that was going on.  <BR> <BR>The best part of the DVD in my opinion was the documentary about the making of the movie.  It had the director talking about the movie, along with other actors in it, and I found it much more interesting than the movie itself.  <BR> <BR>I would reccomend this to anyone trying to learn about history, but anyone else would love to sleep through the movie!
B0000TB050|4.0|The fact that the same dvd has been released in two packaging formats- typical dvd and cd jewel case- has created no end of confusion for buyer and retailer alike.The jewel case version was in the cd stacks in the retail store I went to and the salesperson was convinced it was music only. <br />The Deluxe Limited Edition is probably neither deluxe nor limited. We received both versions as gifts and were able to compare. The only variation we could see was a marginal one in the booklets. <br />And with a price difference of up to $10.00 in some places I've seen you can make your own conclusions.
B000059PQQ|3.0|Based on the 'notorious' book by Terry Southern & Mason Hoffenberg (first published by French Olympia Press), \\"Candy\\" became an instant cult film when it was released.  Not that this is superb or has atristic merits.  On the contrary, the film is actually a hopeless case of loosely-constructed mansion which does not know where to go, or what to do.  But the cast and crew included here is so impressive and the atmosphere of the film is so 60s-like, that you might forgive these fatal defects ... almost.<br />Swedish Eva Aulin is Candy, a pudgey-faced, cute college student.  In spite of herself (or because her innocence, I say) many guys are lured to her, mostly sexually, and shows their hidden side of character.  The respectable facet of their career is torn down before Candy.  Or, in short, they all want to taste candy.<br />Many famous faces show up here; Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, John Huston, and Ringo Starr (yes, that's one of the Beatles).  You see each actor one after another, doing some silly things, acting the part of showy professoer (Burton), crazy general (Matthau), super-surgeon (Coburn), his supervising boss (Huston), and naive Mexican (Starr).  And finally, you see Marlon Brando as Guru Grindl.  All these are meant for satire of the time, but looking back from now, the caricatures lost inevitably the impact.  (Still, Brando's 'frozen guru' is funny even now.) <br />More interesting is the crew; the director is a French actor Christian Marquand, whose CV includes \\"Apocalypse Now: Redux\\" (look for him in the French plantation scene which was originally deleted).  Maybe I should not say this, but the film's slack way of storytelling is largely due to him, considering the fact that the script is provided by Buck Henry.  But of course, Buck Henry can do mistakes.<br />The greatest thing about the film is probably its soundtrack by Dave Grusin (!), which features the songs of The Steppenwolf and The Byrds.  In fact, any Byrds fans should know the work, and the phychedelic rock sound is still refreshing and thrilling to hear.  And the opening/closing special effects are by Douglas Trumbull, who is to direct \\"The Silent Running,\\" and be the supecial effects supervisor of \\"Blade Runner.\\"
B00005JMGL|5.0|anticiped by fantasy fans all over the world, the real-life version of peter pan hit australian screens december 18...<BR>the film had lots to live up to, but the characters were truely brought to life by the actors...<BR>jeremy sumpter [pan] portrayed the character very well and really made the movie light and heart felt.<br />5 stars..<BR>suitable for all ages...<br />plus- peter pan is hot.
6300182282|5.0|Ellen Burstyn and Alan Alda are absolutely on target with their performances -- they capture the changes in all of us during this time period superbly.<br />This has been one of my very favorite movies for a number of years.    I don't want to replace my well-worn VHS with another VHS!  PLEASE, PLEASE release it on DVD!!  The wonderful Mendocino coast scenery would be spectacular.
6305736650|5.0|The magic of \\"Casablanca\\" lies mostly in its romance. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman movie pairing remained their sole and maybe that's the reason why their unimpeachable chemistry became unique. Their fate as star-crossed lovers trapped in Casablanca went down as one of the most memorable. The scenes of their love in Paris woke up 'the sentimentalist' (as Mr. Renault would say) in me. Just look at Rick (Bogart) watching Ilsa (Bergman) in a Paris cafe, over glasses of champagne, the moment she does not look at him. And Bergman? She's one of the most beautiful and best actresses ever to grace the screen, to say the least (\\"Here's looking at you, kid.\\") And her foreign accent just added to her charm.<br />The melodrama is surrounded by patriotic, anti-fascist and adventure tones and given the fact that the film was released when the World War Two was far from over, it's understood that it captivated viewers back then, as it still does now. <br />There are many details in the movie that get it all just right. Whether it is the young Bulgarian couple, the Marseilleaise or other things you may not notice at first viewing but that justify the purchase of the DVD, as you can get back to your favourite scenes again and again, as I do. Besides, the DVD has a stunning picture quality.<br />The bottom line: with \\"Casablanca\\" you get one of the most acclaimed Hollywood movies and two of its most beloved stars in a marvellous coupling. These assets are far outweighing the occassional slow pace and datedness of the movie. Yes, \\"Casablanca\\" may remain a film for ages.
1400049628|4.0|With its title, this book clearly targets a narrow audience of dedicated &quot;tactical&quot; horror fans.  Much of what made this book, and even more, customer reviews of it, enjoyable to me was my uneasy feeling that the author and some reviewers might be taking it as non-fiction, and the even more disquieting, if exceedingly remote, possibility that they might be right.<br />So &quot;The Zombie Survival Guide&quot; is meta-fiction, in which the reader's speculation into the real state of mind of the author, other readers, and his own credulity or lack of credulity is as or more important than the text itself.<br />From another perspective, the book is an audacious cheap writing trick, little more than a few dozen pages, in the form of a &quot;history&quot; of zombie outbreaks, of dashed together story outlines and the barest hints of the story's characters, padded to short book length with an extensive array of weapon and tactics &quot;what if&quot; scenarios which must have been pure fun to write, and published in time for Xmass.  However well it succeeds in bookstores and online, Max Brooks is sure to be the envy of hundreds of less successful and would-be writers who have toiled to flesh out their ideas into a conventional fictional form, when all they really sought was to have fun writing about zombies!  Viewed in this light, even the book's failures in research in such areas as archaic and modern arms and armor, and the basic biological absurdity of brain-infecting viruses that permit muscles to function with no source of metabolic energy, are laudable.<br />Hats off to Mr. Brooks!
0345452577|2.0|I've been a long-time fan of Jonathan Kellerman and have noticed his books steadily declining regarding plot, interest, and entertainment value.  I was hoping &quot;The Conspiracy Club&quot; would bring him out of the rut he seems to have fallen into, but for me, this book only proves he has run out of motivation or has become bored with writing.<br />I am beginning to wonder when the publishing world will grow tired of continually feeding to the reading world mundane works from formerly best-selling authors (i.e. Cornwell, Patterson, Clancy, Kellerman, et.)and instead focus on more talented, unknown authors.  Come on, New York, listen to the readers who are expressing their opinions!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album surely fires you up and wanna keep your blood dancin' all night long...<br />The Best Songs Are...<BR>+Me Against the Music<BR>+Me Against The Music Desi Kulcha Remix<BR>+(I Got That)Boom Boom<BR>+Breathe On Me<BR>+Toxic<BR>+Everytime<br />Fills Are...<br />+Showdown<BR>+Outrageous<BR>+The Hook-Up<BR>+Shadow<BR>+Early Mornin'<BR>+Brave New Girl<br />All of the songs included in this pop CD are engineered with the best and finest instruments and the rhythms that will bring the house down. Me Against The Music collaboration with Madonna changed the way fans looked at Britney. This album is a great Club Tune! It is touched with the Britney Spears Signature that everyone loves!<br />If you have bought one of her albums...you got to have this coz its the Best (But not the Greatest!)<br />=)
B000069CWE|5.0|I like the idea of this album.It has beginning strays away from the point of the song. I don't exactly like the people who made the remixes but they did well. You should buy it if your considering a linkin park collection but don't think theirs enough hip-hop in it.
B00006LLNU|4.0|Whether it was intentional or not, by creating their own language (hopelandic) on earlier releases, Sigur Ros created a highly interpretive brand of music. The words Jonsi sings were so close to English but not quite (and to Icelandic but not quite, so I've been told), that the listener had the ability to let his subconscious pick the words for him, making it an incredibly, if unintentionally, personal piece of music.<BR>    Though the whole album musically doesn't quite reach the emotional power of 'Agaetis Byrjun', A full half of the album does (especially tracks 1,3,4 and 8). But what this album has that Agaetis Byrjun did not have, is a natural extension of interpretive lyrics: Interpretive titles. With no name to the album or any of its songs, the listener is naturally left to create them on his own (For instance, the first track is 'The Greenland Song' in my head because the first time I heard it I was flying over Greenland and the combination of the music and images seen out the window had a profound effect upon me). The effects of creating your own lyrics, titles and images, combined with the revelatory beauty of their music tends to make one believe that Sigur Ros are less a band and more a cult. All I can say is there are worse things on heaven and earth to worship. <BR>    So, who knows why the boys in Sigur Ros left the album nameless. Perhaps it was something personal for them, or done out of laziness, or out of a Loki-ish desire to create music and mayhem, but yet the results are unmistakable. They've taken music to a new level as an artform: The first ever album in which the words, lyrics and images (the liner notes also have only vague images) are the listeners and not the artists. Sigur Ros have created the first ever soundtrack to your life.
0345440900|4.0|This book provides useful guidance on how to &quot;tune in&quot; to your particular baby and communicate with the baby to meet her needs.  More specifically, the author advocates a pattern of Eat, Activity, Sleep, and You (parent time) as essential for a happy baby and happy parents.  The most valuable concepts I got from the book were (1) addressing my baby as a person -- calling her by name, talking to her in first person, and telling her what I am doing when I interact with her; essentially, being respectful; (2) trying to squeeze in some activity between baby's eating and sleeping time, rather than going straight from eating to the crib; and (3) trying to figure out what her assorted cries mean.  What is most disappointing or unrealistic is the author's belief that by tuning in to their baby, new parents will unquestionably be able to decode baby's cries and determine whether baby is hungry, wet, overstimulated, bored, or merely fussy -- simply by listening to the cry and watching baby's body language.  (I looked at the body language / sound of cries interpretation chart for days &amp; still can't figure out why baby is crying.)  Interestingly, the author rejects &quot;schedules&quot; and denies that her EASY (Eat, Activity, Sleep, You) plan is a schedule, though it looks a lot like a schedule to me.  The author addresses her readers, new &quot;mums&quot;, as &quot;luv&quot; and &quot;dearie&quot; -- funny or annoying, depending on your perspective.
B000002B30|5.0|There is a difference between a hit song and a great song, and it's a difference you should bear in mind when considering this collection.  (If you are after a more comprehensive collection, check out the 3-disc &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot;).  My favourite songs on this collection are &quot;Born to Run&quot; (surely one of the greatest rock songs ever), &quot;The River&quot; (to not like this song is to not like Bruce), &quot;Atlantic City&quot;, &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot;, &quot;Secret Garden&quot; and &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (which to me, sums up everything that Springsteen's music is about).  I know that Bruce has written far greater songs than the 18 presented here, but when I need a quick fix, I pop this CD in and have a darn good time listening to it!
B00004XONN|5.0|This album is dark, and beautiful.  Radiohead forces you to listen to music in a different light, and this album is definitely in a different light.  There is nothing traditional about Radiohead, and that is something that we should all appreciate.  Works like &quot;Idioteque&quot; and &quot;The National Anthem&quot; are haunting and provoke thought.  My initial thought after hearing &quot;Idioteque&quot; was &quot;what the hell was that about?&quot;  All of these songs will make you think that.  Nothing compares to seeing them live, but all of their studio work is great, this will not dissatisfy.
B00000IGGA|5.0|This great album opens with Big In Japan, a humorous number in bluesy style with brilliant guitar and innovative arrangement, which is followed by the slow, eerie Lowside Of The Road, a real hangover song with striking imagery.<br />Hold On is a typical sad Waits ballad, which means it's beautiful, tuneful and moving. It has an unusually light rhythm and melody though, unlike some of his other masterpiece ballads like for example In The Neighbourhood or Saving All My Love For You. House Where Nobody Lives is unique too, another gripping ballad with moving words and images. It makes me think of both Mansion On The Hill by Springsteen and the old classic Satisfied Mind.<br />All Waits' styles are in glorious display including the talking blues of Get Behind The Mule and the deep bluesrock of ballads like Come On Up To The House and Cold Water. For someone who prefers his ballads and his singing voice, I find both quite appealing. The next track, Pony, is another one of my favorite slow melodic numbers embellished with exquisite pump organ, dobro and harp.<br />This album certainly lives up to its name with its astonishing variety, like the spooky spoken track What's He Building and the story songs Black Market Baby and Eyeball Kid with its innovative samples and percussion. Waits even explores his Beefheartian side on Filipino Box Spring Hog. There's also the gentle love song Picture In A Frame with its elegant piano and the sorrowful country song Georgia Lee.<br />Mule Variations is a masterpiece of an album that contains impressive, timeless songs of great lyrical depth, melodic beauty and stylistic variety. Whether you like Waits as a phenomenon by himself or whether you like only certain of his styles, this album will not disappoint as it offers enough brilliance for everybody.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Like A Music Fan from Houston, I never liked The Long and Winding Road. I always found it to be long and boring. I liked Let It Be, the song, better, but not by much. I was 5 years old in 1964, when I became mesmerized by the Beatles, and have loved them, and everything they've done, since. I was afraid to listen to this CD, because I am a Beatles purist, and don't like anyone messing with their music. I finally convinced myself that if this was the way they had meant it, then this is the pure version, and the one that deserves the listen. All I can say is, we have been ripped off for the last 30 plus years!!!<BR>This is The Beatles!!! It was so moving that the tears started to well up because on the one hand, it was like having the Beatles still here with us, releasing a new CD, and on the other hand it made me sad to think that actually can't happen.<BR>Forget about all the comments on what is and is not included. None of that matters. The important thing for any one who loves the Beatles, is that this is rock and roll, at it's raw, bluesy best. This is The Beatles!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|I must admit, like other reviewers here, I was rather put off by the idea of \\"The Rising\\" somehow being \\"inspired\\" the September 11 attacks.  There seemed to be too many musicians and writers out there milking the proverbial on the back of such tragedy, which to be frank, is absolutely disgusting and shameful.  Thankfully, Bruce and the E-Street band don't sound self-conscious for a second.  The songs could or could not be about September 11, but what is clear is the universality of the themes.  Certainly songs like \\"Into the Fire\\", \\"Empty Sky\\" and \\"My City of Ruins\\" are connected with the WTC attacks, but the theme is so much more than a one-dimensional half-baked tribute.  Everyone has lost someone for some reason, clear or unclear.  \\"The Rising\\" focuses on the need to carry on regardless of what you've lost, whether it's a friend, a lover, or some part of yourself.  However, Bruce never comes across as condescending or all knowing.  He simply reflects on events in a way only he can. Standout tracks include the ironically joyful opener \\"Lonesome Day\\", the mournful \\"Nothingman\\" and \\"Empty Sky\\", the feel-good rocker \\"Mary's Place\\", the title track, and the fantastic closer, \\"My City of Ruins\\".<br />As several reviewers have noted, \\"The Rising\\" is not going to shock your musical sensibilities - musically Bruce & Co. play it fairly safe, rehashing old tricks such as finger-picked arpeggios and the odd sax thrown in here or there to spice things up. But it all adds to the charm of the album, and it's clear that Bruce is having a great time making it! O'Brien has done a fantastic job in recreating a classic Springsteen sound with a modern twist.  Some of the music on \\"The Rising\\" is a return to the wall-of-sound of \\"Born to Run\\" but not nearly as bombastic.  Some rock purists will loathe the use of hip-hop style break beats, and may feel queasy when listening to the World Music of \\"Worlds Apart\\".  However, unlike on \\"Born In The U.S.A\\" such modern touches actually add the appeal of the album, and show that Bruce isn't totally out of touch with contemporary music.  The saving grace of these effects is that they are used sparsely and to actual dramatic effect, rather than \\"Let's chuck this in here, and there, so the kid's will like, dig it, man.\\" <br />Overall, \\"The Rising\\" is an amiable album, with plenty of great music and themes to keep you entertained.  Despite weight of the themes, this is not Bruce's darkest work.  Nor is it featherweight rock ala \\"Human Touch\\" (a good album in its own right, just not all that rockin').  It's a serious album, yes, but it really does make you feel just that bit more thankful for being alive.  \\"The Rising\\" is the kind of the album that you always hoped Bruce would make - halfway between \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"The River\\".  Well, okay, it's the kind of album I've always wanted him to make, but never thought he would!  <br />This is the work of a man who has rekindled his passion for music and life.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is such a cute & funny movie. I wish that I had seen it when it came out in theatres. I thought that it was going to be lame so that's why I didn't go. I was so surprised how funny this movie is. The dvd is packed with features, I really like that. Be sure to buy this for your dvd collection.
B000002KXV|5.0|Just as his band Steely Dan redefined what a rock album could be in the 1970s with heavy doses of modern jazz and the blues, co-frontman Donald Fagen created his solo debut \\"The Nightfly\\" as a smoothly crafted jazz-rock masterpiece.  \\"Nightfly\\" is a natural extension of the sonic perfection that was Steely Dan's last album \\"Gaucho,\\" with a more eclectic style base, allowing for very diverse songs in a cohesive package.  1950's style jazz-pop tracks such as \\"Walk Between Raindrops\\" and \\"Ruby Baby\\" (with a piano solo that quotes The Kinks \\"You Really Got Me\\") blend with \\"Gaucho\\"-era Steely Dan-sounding tracks like \\"IGY,\\" \\"Green Flower Street\\" and the title track.  Add to this uniquely Donald Fagen compositions like the tropical \\"The Goodbye Look\\" and it creates one of the most interesting rock releases of 1982.<br />Two decades later, this album isn't exactly timeless, but that's not to say that it's not eminently listenable.  It's beautifully done, strangely personal, and quite elegant. That said, it's not for everyone.  Younger listeners may not cotton to Fagen's Kennedy-era references, sometimes languid pacing and likely won't share his love for the electric piano.  Personally, I'm under thirty and I love all those things, but I don't pretend to speak for everyone my age.  Some people who thought Steely Dan got too smooth and polished after \\"Aja\\" will likely not like this album either.  But if you're a fan of solidy composed and performed music, there's no reason that you shouldn't have this album.
B00005JMGL|5.0|This was just the cutest most wondeful magical movie ever!!  There has never been a better casting job.  And I can't believe this is Wendy's first acting job!  WOW!  Jeremy (Peter Pan) is wonderful.  As well as Rachel (Wendy) -- she was just angelic.  The movie was just perfect.  The mother (Olivia Williams) couldn't have been casted better and her acting was superb.  I mean, this movie was sooo good.  And I'm going to see it again -- definitely!  I think Dustin Hoffman is the best Hook ever but Jason Issacs turned in another top-notch performance.  And he always seems to be cast as bad guys -- hmm....  The graphics were great too.  Just a visual feat.  And the mermaids were awesome!  What a creative twist that was.  Totally one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  I felt transported back to my childhood.<br />I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this.  Grrrreat movie!
B00005JMGC|1.0|A female version of \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" its not. The character's aren't well developed. The plot isn't very good either. Julia Roberts plays Katherine Watson, an art history teacher who comes to the conservative and tradition Wellesley College. As she tries to inspire her students to fulfill their potential, some feel threatened by her new ideas and try to hold on to the more traditional ways by making Katherine's job as a teacher quite a challenge.<br />The movie is very boring. I also feel like it insults women who just want to be wives and mothers. Julia Stiles character, Joan knows the options that she has: going to law school or being a housewife and she chooses to be a housewife. When her decision is final & she's happy with it, Katherine is still disappointed. <br />Joan's character chooses a more traditional role, the movie sends the message that it isn't as worthy as being a career woman. The movie should have sent the message that its okay to choose different roads without feeling disappointed. With Joan's character we're supposed to believe that the movie wants women to know that they have options but somehow the film doesn't make this point very well. <br />The movie is lying when it says that women didn't have many options. Maybe it was different for upper class women and that's whom the movie makes its focus on and not the middle class. Its a free country, who cares what society thinks? You should live your life. Besides by the 20s women already had the right to vote.
B000002W8O|5.0|This is the best pop/rock/gospel Christmas album ever produced.  Elvis' favorite time of the year was the Christmas holiday season and his favorite kind of music was Gospel.  Therefore, this album is the best of Elvis' most loved music.  Elvis' voice projects his sincerity in &quot;O Little Town Of Bethlehem&quot; and in &quot;Peace In The Valley&quot; which was his mother's favorite gospel song. His fervor and sensitivity are revealed in &quot;I Believe&quot; and in &quot;It Is No Secret.&quot;  Elvis also demonstrates his playfulness in &quot;Santa Bring My Baby Back To Me&quot; and in &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus.&quot;  Of course, his versions of &quot;Blue Christmas&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot; are perennial favorites.  If fact, it would not seem like Christmas without Elvis Christmas music.  If Elvis was concerned about providing a gift that carried his sentiments of the Christmas season, this album is it.  One can enjoy this album all through the year.
0792842723|3.0|6 long years elapsed since 1989s Licence to Kill. Timothy Dalton stepped down and Pierce Brosnon stepped up as James Bond. The begining was pretty good with all the action. The rest of the movie was prue bull no action, no nothin'. Once again James Bond is going after someone to avenge a friend getting hurt (sound familiar). There is a new James Bond, M and Monneypenny (I think that's how it's spelled). All in all it was a bust it was the second James Bond movie I saw (the first one was The World Is Not Enough).
B00005JMCW|5.0|The premise has already been given so I'm skipping that in this review. I loved it. I was very surprised. I thought that it was going to be dull &amp; lame but the movie actually works. This movie knows when to be sentimental and when to be edgy. The plot is well developed and so are the characters. The script is very good. This is even better than the original! I'm so pleased that they did a remake &amp; that it turned out great. It's the perfect movie to see with your family.
B000002WMH|5.0|Few box sets live up to their billing, but the King Of Rock 'N' Roll: The Complete 50's Masters is the appropriate title for this 5 disc set.  The first 4 discs provide a chronological perspective of Elvis' releases and the 5th disc provides selections from an early concert and some alternate releases.  All the 50's classics are here, such as, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes,&quot; &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; &quot;All Shook Up&quot; and &quot;A Big Hunk O' Love&quot;.  Due to the chronological presentation, one can perceive the evolution of Elvis' voice.  In &quot;My Happiness,&quot; Elvis sounds like a million other kids trying to get a break in the recording studio.  After that, hold on to your hat, because further tracks reveal this young man's raw talent becoming developed and refined.  Elvis was getting in touch with his range, versatility and the rare emotive qualities of song interpretation that made him such a phenomenon.  He had the capability of conveying himself as a confident, high energy and explosive rocker in such songs as, &quot;Reddy Teddy,&quot; &quot;Jailhouse Rock,&quot; and &quot;Baby, I Don't Care.&quot;  At the same time, he could be defined as a sensual, sensitive, and even dramatic balladeer in such songs as, &quot;Love Me,&quot; &quot;Don't,&quot; and &quot;My Wish Came True.&quot;  This set features the country, rythym &amp; blues, jazz, gospel, and pop influences that Elvis synthesized into his music as only he could.  In fact, Elvis sang all of those kinds of songs and yet, gave them his own distinctive style.  Some of the movie songs that are included are not really the best songs that he ever recorded, but they sure are entertaining and they give the full historical perpective of his 50's music. This set also contains songs of special interest, such as, 4 gospel songs, 8 Christmas songs, an uptempo movie version of &quot;Loving You,&quot; the more provocative version of &quot;One Night,&quot; and a fast 50's version of&quot;Ain't That Loving You, Baby&quot; which brings the house down.  Elvis is in the building and definitely in command.  It has been said that &quot;before Elvis, there was nothing&quot; and this set gives the listener an opportunity to read the accompanying booklet and hear the voice that shook the world.  This box set is so amazing, that it's fantastic beyond belief.
0792842731|5.0|It's been 10 years since a good James Bond movie (The Living Daylights). This IS Pierce Brosnan at his very best. There is a perfect amount of action. At least there is a plot going on (unlike T.W.I.N.E. and Die Another Day where there is absoulutly NO plot). Finally a good bond girl, Wai Lin a Chinise Secret Service agent. The story is Elliot Carver, a worldwide media mobile has his right-hand man, Mr. Gupta use his GPS scrambler to send a Royal Navy ship off corse. Then Carver's men in a stealth ship destroy it. The end is onboard that same stealth ship where Bond and Wai Lin slip aboard. Overall this movie is very good and is worth seeing. Enjoy!
B00005JMFO|1.0|Love actually is a dull English comedy. Talk about boring! I also felt that the movie pushed the envelope more than it should have. One of the storylines was about two adult film stars falling in love with each other while making an adult movie. Ugh. Why did the film have to go there? The movie is explicit in showing their \\"scenes\\" together. <br />I thought some of the storylines were unncessary like the one with Keira Knightley. This is a spoiler, but in the movie her husband's best friend finally admits to her that he likes her. Its like okay, so what? She stays with her husband which is a good thing, I'm glad that she stayed faithful but what was the point of that storyline? It just seemed pointless. <br />I also didn't like the various small storylines throughout the movie. I felt like I was watching a soap opera instead of a movie. It would have been great if the movie had one major plot and all the British actors had played major & minor characters. It could have been a great movie but it was disappointing on many levels.
B00005JMCN|5.0|What a marvelous film. An absolutely picture-perfect recreation of a era not recently seen in modern film...the Depression.<BR>I had no idea that in the year 1938, this horse occupied more column inches in the newspapers than Roosevelt (#2) or Hitler (#3). One out of three Americans heard the climactic match race on the radio. 40 million people.<BR>Nowadays, it seems we can't even get one out of three Americans to vote.<BR>The story is well summarized in other reviews.<BR>I'd like to point out an amazing effort by the writer/director Gary Ross. There are so many delightful moments...thoughtful touches that \\"tell the story\\" in most powerful ways. And this is a great story told VERY well.<BR>The inter-jockey interplay during actual races is terrific. A decision to NOT show a tragic event on-screen, followed by agonizingly silent segments, are far more effective than a traditional special-effect-and-sweeping-orchestral-flourish moment. Horse races are always cleanly conveyed...you know who's where, and what our jockey is thinking.<BR>\\"Our jockey\\" being Red Pollard, sharply portrayed by Tobey Maguire. Even better is Chris Cooper. Although he finally has received recognition from the industry, I don't think the public knows how truly gifted he is. He's a joy to watch.<BR>Jeff Bridges, as usual, is solid. He normally elevates his material above it's source, but here he doesn't have to. Ross' screenplay is witty, poetic...it has depth and detail. <BR>As the director, Ross does the same from behind the camera. Just as poetic, with lovely images, thrilling racing sequences, some drop-dead gorgeous vistas...well done Mr. Ross!<BR>Everything from the production design, to the cinematography, to the music (can Randy Newman EVER do wrong?) is so \\"right\\" for this movie, that you won't notice it until after the credits roll.<BR>You're WAY too busy being caught up in the tale of this amazing horse, his owner, his trainer and his jockey.<BR>There are very few guarantees in the moviebiz. If you have a fondness for the type of movies \\"they don't make anymore\\", you will enjoy this film. Guaranteed.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is the best animated movie that Disney's ever made. The story appeals to little ones as well as adults. The plot and characters are well developed. I just love this movie & its so funny. This dvd is packed with stuff like behind the scenes features, videos, music videos, games, and lots of other stuff. Its such a good movie, be sure to buy this one for your dvd collection.
B000065V41|1.0|I really can't believe it. I've waited for so long for this DVD and now I know that it is a \\"edited version\\" of the original film. WHAT? I should buy a cutted version of the movie? Are you crazy? Selling this, Walt Disney is fooling us all. It's like to buy a \\"Mona Lisa\\" by Leonardo da Vinci with just the face and without the body, the hands and the mountains. I wonder what you guys had in mind. One of the most beautiful film ruined by someone without brain. They' ve even cut some scenes!!! I'm sorry for Amazon, but I hope nobody will buy this dvd until the Disney band will reflect on their deeds and their sins. And this is even a special edition, yeah, a special trick. And someone still wonder why people keep downloading the films in internet...
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is so cute! Another wonderful creation from Pixar! The Animation is wonderful, the plot is very good, &amp; its a movie for everyone. This is one movie that didn't disappoint and it deserves all the good hype. It's one of the best movies of 2003. I wish more animated movies were like this! The script is good, the plot is well developed, &amp; the animation is top notch. I highly recommend this movie.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|What a Christmas present!  I have just watched the entire DVD and it is just like being there.  I have attended The Rising tour three times and am a huge fan of Bruce Springsteen.  Stop moaning about the sound...this DVD rocks!  The sound while he was on stage in Montreal was something to complain about but you get so involved in the concert that it doesn't really matter.  Rock on Bruce...there is no limit to the energy and love this man puts in to a concert and it exudes from the DVD.  I will treasure my copy forever. Run don't walk to the store to get your copy...better yet order it from Amazon.
B000089RVX|3.0|This album holds the fairly unique distinction in my music collection of being one of those rare &quot;reach out and grab you with the first listen&quot; albums that has quickly gotten tired sounding.  Somehow songs that previously seemed intense and heartfelt now sound shrill and repetitive.  The lead singer's voice can be really piercing after just a few songs - I feel like if she had just toned it down every now and then the whole record would have benefitted.  As it stands, it's a good album with some standout tracks, but it has lost most of its original luster for me.  If you haven't heard it before, they sound like a female-dominated version of POD - a little less hard, but with the same rap-snippets and quasi-christian vibe.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Can music get any better that this?? I don't think so. <BR>This is by far the best album of 2003. <BR>It is creativity flowing at its max, instrument expertise from all members, rage, passion and lyrics that are almost impossible to understand. When you put all this things together you get &quot;psyco-progressive-rock-punk-jazz&quot; music that leaves you with all kind of sensations right on your skin.<BR>   Must see live !!
B00008H2LB|3.0|This album sounds like a continuation of Hybrid Theory, so if you liked that, you'll like this.  IMO Hit the Floor is by far the best track on the cd - loud and furious without so much of the whining teenager syndrome that plagues most of their more &quot;anthemic&quot; songs.  Overall very slick and polished, maybe a bit too slick.  Basically exactly what you'd expect from LP.
0385504209|2.0|The popularity of Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code just proves that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  Beyond the fascinating concept relentlessly driven home throughout the book and the fun, treasure hunt atmosphere, the characterization was awful--it was hard to care about the main characters at all, there was really no plot, and the obvious good (Priory of Sion) vs. evil (Catholic Church) was so overdone that it is hard to justify the book's popularity without attributing it to the basic premise of the story.  Read this book well armed with facts before you read.<br />Many are accepting fiction as fact based on the characters' scholarly retelling of a myth that originated with the Freemason Society in the 17th century (see The Templars, by Piers Paul Read; 2000, 303-306)<br />There is absolutely no mention of Jesus or Mary Magdalene in the Dead Sea Scrolls (see The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls by Gaza Vermes; 1997, 21-22) as Brown's protagonist insists; and, if Leonardo DaVinci was a grand master in a secret grail society trying to preserve a message for future generations via &quot;The Last Supper,&quot; why would he use painting materials that ended up deteriorating even in his lifetime? (see Authors and Artists for Young Adults, vol. 40, Gale Group, 2001)<br />Read this book to enjoy the treasure hunt, but don't accept it as truth.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is by far her best CD yet and one of the best CDS of the year, if you haven't gotten it yet, go out and get it, you won't regret it! I was surprised how good it is!
B00008HCCF|5.0|She is simply the best artist in the world. I love her sweet jazzy tunes, lovely voice and piano playing and her handsom band. You would love how all of them play their instruments they seem very cautious with every note they play. Such a perfect quartet. Buy this, you wouldn't regret, take my word.
0312263120|3.0|The story would be better if the characters were consistant and believable.  I didn't like the development of characters Susan or her boss, Strathmore (two of the main characters).  Susan, supposedly a strong and intelligent woman as well as highly respected in the NSA, becomes a weak idiot when faced with a crisis?  She and Strathmore are inconsistant in their words and behavior and that ruins the book.<br />Strathmore, also highly respected in the NSA (Susan's boss) supposedly is extremely intelligent, at the top of the NSA hierachy, and has a secret crush on Susan and thus is allowing his marriage of thirty years to dissolve? Susan has NO IDEA about this until she becomes involved in this current crisis. Strathmore sends David, Susan's love, on a mission hoping he is killed so they can be together?  His secret password is &quot;Susan&quot;? Pleeeaaase!  Also Susan, a professional, intelligent, strong, respected, secure woman becomes a sniveling air-head when her boyfriend has to leave on an important mission and disrupts their romantic weekend plans.  UGH!<br />Stupid ideas and inconsistant character traits.  If the characters were more realistic and believable the story could have been excellent.  But as it is, the story is only good.<br />I read this after &quot;DaVinci code&quot; and was disappointed.  At least Dan Brown has gotten better -- I though DaVinci Code was excellent.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see the show at the Royal Albert Hall, and it was the most moving concert I've experienced.  I can't believe how well it's been captured here.  It says so much to see such a talented and diverse group of friends work so hard to pull this one night only show together, and for all the right reasons.  You can tell they are incredibly inspired and moved by what they're doing, and it clearly helped them deal with a loss.<br />And the performances, out of this world! Billy Preston on &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot;, Clapton/McCartney/Starr on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, a Wilbury's tune, the Eastern music, and the Pythons too. There will never be another show like this.  There was a lot of talent, and many egos on that stage, but they all kept it in check by remembering what was important.  Don't pass this up!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the best Britney's Album.<br />I was really amazed that every single song from this CD is really good. You can find how much she's grown once you hear it. You find lots of genres, can't stop dancin', can't help sing.<BR>Go on n' buy it. You won't regret it. It is really worth it. Oh my God, all the songs are so horny! <BR>The only thing I can say it's that I expected much more from Moby. Early Morin' ain't a song good enough in contrast with the rest of the CD, whereas P. Daddy's \\"The answer\\" it's really good.<BR>Come n' watch how much Britney has improved her music since \\"Oops\\".<BR>I think Britney's gonna have a hard time choosin' her singles. ALL THE SONGS WORTH IT..!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is just a warning for some of you people, this cd is not what most of you think is rock, I am sorry to say that there is not a lead singer that lacks any singing talent whatsoever. Amy Lee is not forced to scream &quot;DIE! B**CH DIE!&quot; and other fun phrases like that. It doesn't matter how hard it is to play their music either, all that matters is that they composed it, they did a great job and their songs have meaning whether you want to believe that or not. But people have so many different tastes in music I don't see the point in these reviews. Personally I love this band and this cd. But it's up to you now isn't it?
B000002IKR|5.0|This is as fast and heavy as ****.  A brilliant debut album from a very young bunch of musicians.  The production in some parts are a little chaotic, but the music makes up for this plenty.  Stick it in the car with your Mother in Law in the back and play it load!
0790743221|5.0|Katharine Hepburn recreated her Broadway role as the spoiled brat socialite caught between 3 men, her ex-husband (Cary Grant), her boring fiance, and the sneaky reporter (Jimmy Stewart) who's come to cover the society doings and snoop into a brewing scandal. George Cukor directed this sparkling, witty, fast-paced 1940 movie that propelled Hepburn into Hollywood fame and provided the structure for many knock-offs, including, several decades later, High Society. <BR>The Philadelphia Story gives an excellent intro if you're into following the trajectory of Katharine Hepburn and the other fine, famous actors who starred in this film.
B00005JM0B|2.0|OK this is the 3rd instalment by a new director who says on the DVD special feature disc that he wanted to emulate the excitement of the previous 2 films.  Trouble is this film doesn't come anywhere near the genius of the first 2. The special effects are good; especially the car chase, but you can't build a film like this solely on effects and ignore the dialogue.  I thought this was an OK movie, but that's all.  It just always had something missing for me and I believe it would have been better if somebody else with a little more imagination had written it.
6304708521|2.0|I saw the color VHS-tape of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; a few years ago, and it's a boring, waste of time.  The Beatles take a bus ride through England and not much happens. It's really just a &quot;what I did on my vacation home movie&quot; that is just as dull as your next-door neighbors' home movies. The Beatles are/were musicans, not filmmakers. They're not Richard Lester,(who directed &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;Help&quot;), by any means. This was first a black and white tv special, that was later shown in color.  It's the first major project the Beatles did without Brian Epstein, (their manager who died in 1967), and it shows how important he really was. There are supposed to be a lot of &quot;in-jokes&quot; for people in the 'inner circle', but, the 'inner cicle' does not include the average person who will neither find the film funny, or interesting.  &quot;MMJ&quot; is the only real disaster the Beatles had, which isn't bad considering their large output from 1962 to 1970.  Get &quot;MMJ&quot; only in a group set, with something else, where it's almost a freebie, otherwise just buy the CD soundtrack.  &quot;MMJ&quot; isn't even bad enough to enjoy as a guilty pleasure.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Bruce Dickinson has come back and this is a prity good album.  I am no way a hardened Maiden fan cause some of their albums in the past have been repetitive and boring. But live, they rock and their music has in some way always been and away from the glam rock bands of Eighties and Nineties that have been and gone.  Favourite tracks have to be Rainmaker and No More Lies.  But overall the whole album has something to offer.
B0000A1RJI|2.0|The Music is nothing but cheap synths-based Sh**... A great orchestral Score would have done the movie even better. There is only one good Theme heard in the score, dominated by the fiddles at the beginning and end of the score. It is a shame they did not let Alan SIlvestri do the job...<BR>But Jerry Bruckheimer does not know anything about good film music... anyway, if you watch the movie, just try not to pay too much attention to its music
B0000AK7AA|4.0|Casper (not to be confused with \\"Casper: A Spirited Beginning\\" or any of the Casper The Friendly Ghost cartoons) is an interesting mix of elements both good and bad - but mostly good.<br />Without a doubt, the movie's strongest asset is its humor.  By and large, this is thanks to Casper's uncles Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso (The Ghostly Trio), all of whom are hilariously animated and perfectly voiced by three actors whose names I unfortunately can't remember.  Bill Pullman is also very funny as Dr. Harvey, and great supporting comic performances are lent by Cathy Moriarty as the evil Carrigan Crittenden and Eric Idle as Carrigan's long-suffering sidekick, Dibs.<br />All of this, of course, amounts to a sub-plot in the end - a prominent one, but a sub-plot nonetheless.  The main story is that of Casper (voiced by Malachi Pearson) and Dr. Harvey's young daughter, Kat (Christina Ricci).  Ricci says some of her lines awkwardly (in my opinion), but for the most part does a nice job.  Jessica Wesson's portrayal of Amber, the snotty girl at Kat's school, is perfect.  <br />I think the movie's flaws lie in its plot more than anything else.  For instance: throughout the story, Kat has a crush on Vic, the supposedly cute (and slimy) kid at her school, but in the end when Vic shows his true colors and stands her up at the Halloween party, she doesn't really seem to care at all.  There is a brief shot of her sitting by the wall with a pouty (well, really, more broody) expression on her face, but this is dispensed with in an instant.  <br />Another of my biggest beefs is with the ending.  I don't want to give away specifics, but it is the weakest part of the story - bittersweet and touching one moment, and then it turns raucous and weird before you can blink.  Makes you want to throttle the nearest neck.<br />Ah, well.  As I said earlier, the movie is far more good than bad, and of course everything here is just one person's opinion.  Who knows.  You might love the ending.  But if not, I have a feeling you'll like most everything else.
B000060K4O|5.0|Not only is this one of the funniest movies ever made but its also one of the best DVDs Ive seen.  You get the greats, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Ernie Hudson at their best and they all work great with each other.  The story is absolutely brlliant and it allows all of the actors to do their best.  Not only that but it was one of the pioneers of its kind of special effects and the shot of the Staypuft Marshmellow man is still amazing.  The DVD itself has great picture and sound and the special features are unbeleivable.  You will definately get a kick out of the MST like Commentary by Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman and the writer.  They have fun and it adds something to watching the movie with the commentary.  The deleted scenes as well as the art they included and the documentaries on the film, short but to the point all give extra hours of entertainment.
B000092Q4U|4.0|Angry, speed-metal at its best. This ain't your Linkin Park &quot;ready-for-the-radio&quot; offering. Rhythmically tight and instantly head banger ready. The lyrics aren't pretty, but that's the point with this type of music. It's fast, mean, and loud. It's broken ribs in the mosh pit, with at least a few nice-sized bruises. I noticed people that reviewed this album mainly criticized the vocals and what they perceive as a lack of musicianship from this offering. &quot;Lots of double bass,&quot; as one reviewer stated. Okay, whatever. And maybe someday we'll all appreciate the musical genius of David Lee Roth (shoo bee-da-boobity bop!). I personally like a spine-cracking bass drum and grinding ax. Kind of have to wonder why somebody that listens to &quot;Vader&quot; would even stop to take a second look at this album. You won't find any neat little ballads or love songs on this album. See you in the pit (or I guess if you're the guy with the Vader shirt, we'll see you in the back holding our stuff for us while we mosh)!!
B0000CAQ27|2.0|After releasing 2 amazing studio albums, Pink really seems to have lost her inspiration.<br />Although I love her trying to be a rebel, I just think &quot;Trouble&quot; was a really big mess. In fact, I think she's struggling way too much to be a rebel. She's very exaggerated sometimes...<br />Most of the material on this album is uninspired, weak and dissapointing. <BR>Hope to see the real Pink soon........
0399226907|5.0|My grandmother gave me a book every birthday and Christmas - my favorite presents - and this year I thought I would start that tradition with my nine younger nieces and nephews.  It worked!  In the center of a room full of battery-operated fire engines and the like, Aaron (3) asked for \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" to be read aloud to him twice even before all the other gifts were unwrapped.  What better testament to the author and illustrator - thank you.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I hadn't seen any of Season 1 before on the recommendation of someone at work, I started watching The Shield in the middle of Season 2.  Oh, am I glad she made me watch this, as it's unlikely I would have found it, mired as it is on FX.  Other reviewers here have mentioned that this is a great cop show.  It is.  But it's more than that.  It is one of the very few shows where you can feel your guts twisted in ethical knots when you see the dilemmas faced by the Strike Team.  Makes you wonder, &quot;what would I do in that situation.&quot;  Also makes you wonder &quot;how can they make this show any better?&quot;  Bet they will, somehow...  Can't wait for March '04 for the new season.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD is absolutely wonderful. I only miss a couple of songs that are really great and were not sung:&quot;Long,long&quot; and &quot;Think for yourself&quot;.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before getting this DVD and wasn't sure if I should get it or not but glad that I did!  I don't play the guitar and a lot of others say that this DVD was over dubbed and I couldn't tell and really don't care because it sounded so awesome in on surround sound!  AC/DC clicks together like no other band ever and this is recommended for any AC/DC fan or anyone who is just getting into AC/DC!<br />They will never die!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is, without a doubt, THE definitive collection of live Led Zeppelin cuts. I had seen the black &amp; white Danish radio concert before and this is superb early Zeppelin. I had never seen the Albert Hall 1970 performance. Oh boy! I grew up listening to Zeppelin (I am 44) and I can tell you, this is killer material.<br />Now check out the review by Wayne Woodall. This guy is complaining that some songs were &quot;drastically overplayed&quot;. Come on, Wayne-a-roo!!! THAT is what made Zeppelin so incredible. You could bet your a** that when you went to see them, you were not going to get a six minute version of Dazed and Confused. The ONLY part of Woodall's comments on which I will agree is the fact that John Paul Jones was under-rated by fans (not by THIS one) and the press.<br />OK, Zep fans, get out and BUY this set!
0553208845|4.0|This novel is written in the simple, spare language of a parable, similar to Steinbeck's &quot;The Pearl.&quot;  However, the book deals with weighty topics: the tension between the individual and society, and what constitutes spiritual fulfillment.<br />This book does not chart out a path towards enlightenment, that can be followed in simple steps.  If you think that can be realized in a book, perhaps you should read something else-- maybe one of the self-help books arcing through the bestseller lists before it disappears into oblivion.  Siddhartha is a seeker, and probably only seekers-- those who have not adopted wholeheartedly a certain doctrine or dogma-- will appreciate this book.<br />Since Siddhartha is a seeker, he makes many &quot;mistakes,&quot; but those mistakes are necessary for his individual enlightenment.  At first, he is obsessed with spiritual fulfillment, leading him to leave his comfortable Brahmin life and become an ascetic Samana.  He meets Gotama the Illustrious One and is aware of the Buddha's enlightenment, but realizes that enlightenment cannot &quot;rub off&quot; on him from the Buddha.  At that point, he realizes that he should not smother his Self, but should appreciate his Self and the struggles of external reality (Samsara).<br />Eventually, Siddhartha becomes disgusted with the wine, women, and song of Samsara, and considers suicide, when he begins to approach true enlightenment.  Some have called this the &quot;leap of faith,&quot; others &quot;hitting bottom.&quot;  In any case, only by hitting the depths of despair does Siddhartha attain true enlightenment.<br />I wholly recommend this book to those interested in spiritual themes and greater truths, but are not ideologically &quot;stuck.&quot;  Siddhartha suggests a great truth: that while Samsara might not lead to true happiness, one does not appreciate Samsara and Nirvana until one has experienced both.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful little book that will start the mind thinking of greater truths lying beyond our day-to-day lives.  If you are perfectly satisfied with your day-to-day existence or have a certain ideological worldview that neatly explains higher truths, you will not appeciate this book on the same level.thinking of greater truths lying beyond our day-to-day lives.

B00005JMFI|5.0|I loved this movie! It was sweet, wholesome, and totally hilarious! Will Ferrell is raised by elves up at the North Pole, only to find out he is not an elf himself! So he sets out to find his real father. The hilarity starts when he does! James Caan plays a hardened business man, who not only isn't interested in his new son, but doesn't believe his story. Go see Elf!!! It's funny and heartwarming. If you loved the Santa Clause, starring Tim Allen, you'll love ELF!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I listen to certain things and I always find the right things. Well... I would say this is one of my best choices. This cd has a lot of rock in her music and that's what we are looking for!!! All her songs have great lyrics!!! Way to go PINK!!! She has the best voice. If I had to choode my favorite singer, I would choose Pink.
B00005BL2A|4.0|Well, it had to come - VIOLATOR, SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION, and ULTRA: three of the finest albums ever made, and the good things had to end somewhere; the band had to falter sometime or the other. Worse still, after most of the bands undergo line-up changes they do tend to make sloppier albums, not having the faintest idea of what they are doing with themselves. After being reduced from foursome to threesome, surprisingly, Depeche Mode (DM) didn't get affected by the line-up-change shock. Instead they came up with probably the best album of their musicianship-career, ULTRA.<br />By the time EXCITER was made, the band was well overdue to be bitten by the `line-up-change' bug. At last, with this album, DM has given in. So, after three mind-blowing LPs, the band has ultimately slackened, but not by much. EXCITER is the first DM album in years, which seems somehow quite incomplete, at least by DM standards. <br />Before anything else, there are copious reasons, why this is also such a fantastic album. To begin with, the beautifully acoustic \\"Dream On\\", which is subtly simple, has amazingly cool guitar hooks, with Dave Gahan's vocals, spookily resembling The The's Matt Johnson. The very sensuous \\"Shine\\", undoubtedly the best song in EXCITER, has Dave doing his usual thing, being effortlessly charming, while the brilliant music and the wicked drum-programming soothe the tumultuous brain into a state of meditation. Quite like \\"Barrel Of A Gun\\" in ULTRA, is \\"The Sweetest Condition\\": disrupted and cacophonous, but anomalously delightful. With \\"I Feel Loved\\", an uncomplicated foot-tapper, DM relives its `VIOLATOR' days, when dance-music was straightforward and comprehendible. \\"I Am You\\", is another memorable song from this album; devoid of any apparent percussion, in its bleakness, it builds up slowly to an awesome climax, which is its chorus.<br />Besides all the fantastic music that EXCITER has to offer, it slackens in a lot of songs, which really don't make the album asdelectable as it should actually have been. In all their incompleteness, \\"Freelove\\", \\"Comatose\\", \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" and \\"Breathe\\" seem a bit insipid, whereas similar kind of songs like \\"Shine\\" and \\"I Am You\\", in their manner of execution, excel. While \\"The Dead Of Night\\" so closely resembles \\"Barrel Of A Gun\\" and \\"The Sweetest Condition\\" superficially, it sadly doesn't conjure up the same magic as these songs do. And as always, even EXCITER has a couple of instrumentals, \\"Lovetheme\\" and \\"Easy Tiger\\", which are a complete waste of time in this album. <br />Though EXCITER is quite an amazing album, it is also sketchy in parts, lacking vitality where it could have done with some. Maybe that the change of line-up has got to the band finally, maybe it is the change in the album-producer, maybe a slightly weakened album was long time coming for this band, or maybe it is just an album, for which the band might have recorded too few worthy songs, and might have added a few more tracks in a hurry, for merely filling it up.
B00006L3S3|4.0|Lennon creates a masterpiece without knowing it on this album. At first it seems overwhelming to most, but after repeated listenings it gets better and better.    The Title track is eaisly the best song on the album. \\"Meat City\\" goes for second. \\"Out of the Blue\\" and \\"Intuition\\" are also great.    The CD insert is also intresting. The drawings by Lennon are very entertaining.    This Album falls short of 5 Stars because of the lack of worthwhile bonus tracks. The bonus tracks here are home versions of three of the songs and aren't worth the listen.    An excellent album by a very talented musicain. Requried listening for all rock fans.
B00005K3OT|4.0|I found Chacolat to be a very enjoyable movie.  Though some parts of it were a bit boring, most of the movie was good clean fun.  Binoche does a spectacular job in the part of Vinnette, the upbeat chacolater.  Also Olin is praiseworthy for her part as a bruised wife who attempts to turn her life around.<BR>Ok now on to Johny Depp, I'll give it to people that he is a hansome, and fun to watch, but was he really that amazing of an actor?  I'm not saying he's horrible but I certainly wouldn't call him the stand out peformance.<BR>The supporting cast really saved this movie from being boring.  As the major Alfred Molina is great and a very beleivable pious man.<BR>Thivisol is good in the part of Vinettes daughter, she shows the perfect amount of emotion as her child part could.<BR>Judi Dench is exeptional as the old diabetic crazy women, rich with enthusiasim wich is just what the film needed.<BR>Finally Carrie Anne Moss was wonderful as Dench's &quot;high moralled&quot; daughter.  She put a lot of energy into the part whuch also helped with the exitment level of the film.<br />This movie is DEFINATLY worth having on the shelf, and the fettures on the dvd arn't bad either, especially if you like to know what went on behind the scenes.  I also recomend having a chacolat bar with you while watching this movie.
B0000542D2|1.0|If you buy a DVD with the belief that it will come closer to the theater experience, &amp; the intent of the artists, this is DVD is a definite disappointment.

Wait for the next reincarnation, one that is worthy of the artists' accomplishment.  <br />It is sad that Lennon's vision should be compromised by shortsighted production.  Miramax has taken a bite out of Apple; it isn't original, but it is a sin nonetheless.
B00006RAKP|5.0|While I am not a fan of all of Sir Elton's music, there are definite highlights....and this compilation captures them all.  The whole reason for my buying this was the inclusion of &quot;Nikita&quot;...one of the best Elton songs ever made (IMHO).  The video for this song is absolutely awesome...and it would have been great if the CDs had been enhanced to include it.  Beyond that, this compilation is a good one...featuring all of Elton's gems...in a basically chronological order.  Other great songs here: &quot;I'm Still Standing&quot;, &quot;Bernie and the Jets&quot;, &quot;Circle of Life&quot;, and &quot;Blessed&quot;...among others.  Everyone can find an Elton John song to like...so why don't you try him out for yourself?  You won't be disappointed!

B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is an excellent compilation for fans of old and those who are just discovering the wonders of Fleetwood Mac.  This collection is really good because it contains the well-known hits as well as a few lesser known ditties.  Their songs are really accessible, simply because the subject matter is about things we can all relate to: namely love and things surrounding that emotion.  If you have never listened to Fleetwood Mac's music before, or if you are like me, and trying to find out all of the hits they had in the past, then this CD is right for you.  Go out and buy it today!
B00005JM02|5.0|When I noticed that there are already so many reviews of FINDING NEMO, I decided there is no need to write another. But then I thought, why not add my voice in praise of a truly enjoyable film?<br />FINDING NEMO is simply an enjoyable film, nothing more, nothing less. Like so many Disney animated features, the film tells a story of tragedy and triumph, in a way that children can understand and adults can enjoy. FINDING NEMO is no exception.<br />The film tells the story of a small clownfish named Nemo who gets caught by a scuba diver and ends up in a dentist's aquarium. The plot tells of the ways in which Nemo plans to return to his father and the methods that Nemo's father Marlin uses in his attempt to find his son. Along the way the father encounters great dangers, but he meets a range of characters along the way including a new found friend named Dory and a group of sea turtles with personalities that resemble \\"surfer dudes.\\" Eventually the two are reunited, but this is only after much intrigue and some interesting plot twists.<br />Like other Pixar features produced by Disney (TOY STORY immediately comes to mind), there is more to FINDING NEMO than meets the eye. The depiction of the underwater world is amazing and oceanographically correct as far as environment and natural enemies are concerned. The story deals with pain and loss when Merlin loses his wife and most of his children, and the bond he has with Nemo is realistic. Nemo has a slight disability (a shortened fin) but yearns to be like the other fish, again a realistic touch. Dory is a loyal friend and the friendship between Marlin and Dory is touching to say the least. Marlin needs Dory's enthusiasm and Dory needs Marlin due to her won disabilities (short term memory loss chief among them). The dentist and his diabolical niece Darla add an amusing touch.<br />I have found that children who see the movie love it for its special effects, but adults find the film moving. When the movie was playing in theatres, some parents did have to take small children out at the beginning because of the death of Coral, Marlin's wife, so parents may want to keep this in mind and skip the opening scenes. It is truly a film that crosses generational boundaries, as the box office figures show, and it destined to become another Disney Classic. The DVD set has many interesting bonus features including a documentary about the making of the film and virtual underwater aquariums.tres, some parents did have to take small children out at the beginning because of the death of Coral, Marlin's wife, so parents may want to keep this in mind and skip the opening scenes.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|the matrix realoded is a great movie!!!<BR>i love it!!!!!<BR>you should see it!!!
0780631684|1.0|Ok, so I was in the mood for a scary movie, I thought this would be scary. WRONG!!!!!! Not scary, just gross.  This reminded me of something the sicko boys at my school who are obsessed with stickdeath.com would have come up with.  In the plane crash scene, you see a person explode and Alex get burnt to a crisp.  His friend dies by slipping on a mysterous liquid in the bathroom and being hung or stranggled to death by a wire cord that was acting as a clothes line.  The girl steps out into the street and is hit by a bus and her blood/body pieces go flying into her friends faces.  Charming, I know.  The teacher...this scene goes on forever.  She gets, stabed, burned, electricuted, what doesn't happen to this poor lady?! A guy is almost hit by a train but gets out in the nick of time and as they all stand there, in shock, a piece of metal that was under the train, shoots out and cuts this one guys head off...well, part of his head. Mouth up.  You see his head go rolling and his body falls to the ground while another guy pisses his pants.  Then you go into this whole &quot;I'm gonna die, No...wait...I changed seats. She's gonna die&quot; thing. Totally stupid.  So then they all make it and 6 months later, their finally in Paris, and he is almost killed and then the other guy gets killed by a big sign or something.  Or if you watch the other ending, the main guy gets burned to death.  Really gross, you see his skin actually frying.  Then I think something happens to the other guy. I don't know, I try not to remember. I guess if you are a sick, demented person, who likes watching people die in gross, horriable, but thank God, highly unlikely, ways...This is a movie for you. If you don't want a ton of gore, and were just looking for a scary movie like I was...DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!
B0000C1HLF|2.0|I liked the first \\"Charlie's Angels\\" film. All three lead actresses were charming and had great chemistry together, the action scenes were surprisingly exciting and it didn't take itself too seriously. It was just fun. The sequel, \\"Full Throttle\\", however, is a letdown. Although Cameron, Drew and Lucy are still sexy and adorable, the script is awful. It's just an incoherent mess. Almost all of the jokes fall flat, and this time the action sequences are poorly conceived and executed. The only thing I really found interesting about the film was the casting of Demi Moore as \\"fallen angel\\" Madison Lee. Moore is diabolically sexy in the role, so it's too bad the script doesn't give her enough to do. With four of the most exciting actresses in Hollywood in one film, it's really a shame the writers and director couldn't make this film work.
B00002MVQO|5.0|I just got this cd and I listened to it maybe 5 or 6 times in one day! It has so much depth and it tells a story. It's pulls your attention with the opening track &quot;london calling&quot; and has you with them for the rest of the album. My favorite track is &quot;Lost in the supermarket&quot;. It's got a kind of mellowy feel and it reminds me of the smashing pumpkins &quot;1979&quot;. With it's political issues and rebel with a cause message, this album is sure to please any kid who likes rage against the machine. But the clash is so much more diverse with there sound, mixing reggae,rockabilly, and punk into one. Perfect in every way, I advise everyone who loves punk or political rock to go purchase it immediately!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wish I had tuned in when it was on the air, but something makes me thimk I wouldn't have given it much hope since FOX doomed it from the get-go.  However, I went ahead and purchased the set when it came out due to the fact I enjoy all of Joss's material.  I was not disappointed.  This is a VERY well done series and enjoyable.  I LOVE all the characters and wish it had been treated better by FOX.  If you are &quot;thinking&quot; about this series think no more.....buy it.  It's well worth it.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|It seems that 9 out of 10 people that have reviewed this album think that it sucked. I believe these people just wanted another dream theater album like the last two. Hello? - that's not what progressive bands do. anyway.<br />When i first listened to the album I admit I found the heaviness of the guitar sound a bit overwhelming. Petrucci was already a very powerful player, I don't think he needed turning up to 11. However, it fits in very well in a lot of places for dramatic effect (the middle part of honor thy father for example). I think on this album JP has taken himself from an extremely good technician to almost the Yngwie Malmsteen level of speed and mastery.<br />A lot of people seem to think that Jordan was having a week off when the guys went into the studio, I disagree, I think that we were all a bit spoilt from SFAM where he was in every little line. And were these people not listening to his interludes in stream of consciousness (not to mention his harmonies with JP). I think Jordan's playing is incredible, just because it was not as melodic and constantly in major keys doesn't mean he's not doing his job. Also, the orchestration of the songs suggests he had a lot more to do with the writing process than ever before.<br />Mike's drumming moved on slightly, there were his usual smattering of offbeats and rhythmic creativity, (and his drum roll at about 2:50 into stream of consciousness kicks ass.) - however, i think his cymbal work suffered slightly in favour of a heavier sound overall. However, I think there was a lot less to work with this time (newsflash: you can't have Dance of Eternity on every album you fools).<br />John Myung i thought could've done more on this album, but at times the songs didn't really allow him to. His riff in the interlude of Stream of Consciousness is a killer. <br />James tried a little too hard to sing with a raspier, lower sort of voice, perhaps in line with his peers, perhaps in line with the music, however, there are quite a few vocal harmonies (esp name of god) that make up for it.<br />I think as far as the songs themselves go, I found a large correlation between this disc and disc one of 6DOIT. <br />The standout songs are Endless Sacrifice and Stream of Consciousness. <br />I think SOC is the best instrumental written since Metallica's Orion (and probably goes past it) - there are so many flashes of technical brilliance, and the lead riff is one of those riffs that makes you think. The harmony between JP and JR at the end reminded me of LTE's Kindred Spirits - outstanding.<br />The riff at about 8m into Endless Sacrifice is 24K gold. Its lyrics are excellent and the chorus riff is excellent. The back and forth of key and guitar solos between about 6:20 and 8:00 rocks.<br />This Dying Soul was a bit all over the place the first 5 or 6 times i listened to it, but i began to tie it together, and it is a great song. The 2 guitar harmony part for the chorus brings me back time and time again. I think the re-visitation of the mirror and glass prison work well.<br />As I Am has one of the catchiest riffs I have heard in years, but not much more. I think it was their one last attempt to get mainstream radio play. I like the lyrical rhythm in the verses though, I think that saves the song a little.<br />Honor thy father is the &quot;the great debate&quot; of this album. and not just because of the overdubbed spoken parts. The build up of layer after layer of guitar and keyboard harmonies towards the end of the bridge is truly haunting, and ultra chunky riff at the start (repeated in the bridge) sets a dark tone to the song which I thought worked well. <br />Vacant was a good lead-in to Stream of Consciousness. Much like wait for sleep did for learning to live. James obviously wrote that from the heart.<br />A lot has been written about In The Name of God being a terrible song. It took me a lot of listens to come around to this song (then again it took me a lot of listens to come aroundto beyond this life too) but now i'm happy i stuck it out, the chorus's vocal harmonies are great, the guitar soloing is quite good (just because it's extremely fast doesn't mean it's unnecessarily fast you idiots). This song has a lot of harmony work (both double guitar and guitar+keyboard) which i found extremely stimulating, and it has a very grand, epic sort of feel to its conclusion.<br />Overall, if I had to compare the album to previous DT stuff, i'd say awake and 6DOIT, but it's best not to do that, this is a different album altogether, and one that I feel is they're most technically proficient. Buy it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Train of Thought is a great album. Sure, Scenes from a Memory might be a little bit better and Six Degrees had its moments, but this is a really solid album. I'm not a fan of metal music, so I had my doubts about this one. But it has really grown on me in the last month and is now my favorite Dream Theater album. If you're a DT fan then you should pick this one up. If you're a metal fan then you too should definetely check it out.
0345452577|3.0|I must agree with most of the reviews. Lack of momentum and energy, lack of a gripping storyline, very little suspense, and a story that could have been written (with more excitement) on fewer pages.<br />I did like the cover.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|I'm normally not a fan of action-type movies, but the Italian Job is really well-made and has a great plot (note: I have not seen the original). The actual &quot;Italian Job&quot; is a gold robbery pulled off in Venice, Italy. But it is discovered one of the team is a selfish traitor. He takes everyone else's share of the loot, kills the safecracker leader of the gang and leaves the rest for dead, but they methodically plot revenge to get their gold back - adding the 'legit' safecracker daughter of the assassinated safecracker to the team. There are plenty of plot twists, one involving the Russian mob. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron have wonderful chemistry and Edward Norton is perfectly cocky. Seth Green is also funny as the computer hacker (again - first was Enemy of the State). The Mini Cooper chase alone is worth renting this movie - it is awesome!
B00001U0DP|5.0|I loved this movie.  I think this movie, more than any other movie I've ever seen, showcases the resilience of the human spirit and its ability to triumph over almost any adversity.  <br />I've read bitter criticism of this film from those who believe that it trivialized the horrors of the Holocaust.  I can't fault people for feeling the way they do and if that's what they feel, then I respect that, but I didn't see that at all.<br />For me, &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; humanized the Holocaust like nothing else ever could.  For me, Roberto Benigni and his family were real (and no doubt, there were real people like them who were sent to the camps).  For me, this movie made the Holocaust seem even more important than it had been before.  It showed me that wonderful, innocent people died and that others gave their lives so the people they loved could live.  Of course, I know that from history books, but no history book I've ever read has packed the emotional punch of &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot;<br />Benigni's performance in this film was so perfect I can't even think of a performance that comes close.  Even Adrian Brody's beautiful performance in &quot;The Pianist&quot; wasn't the tour de force of Benigni's.  Benigni gives us a tragicomic masterpiece that I don't think can ever be equalled.  To those who did not like the comedic aspects of this film, let me just say this:  for some of us, and I am one, the comedic touches only served to heighten the ensuing tragedy.<br />The ending of this film left me so emotionally shattered that I haven't been able to watch the film again, even though I want to do so.  This is a beautiful film.  The script is perfect, the acting is perfect and the story is so heartbreaking in its perfection that it will live forever in my being.  I will never look at the Holocaust again in the same way, i.e., as a historical event.  Instead, I will think of the Holocaust as something that happened to individual human lives.<br />I treasure thisfilm.  It's perfection and it does show me that life, even with all of its pain and tragedy, can indeed, be beautiful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wouldn't be able to say enough about the series or the DVD, the summation of everything (all positive i might add) can be said with Awesome.  It is the greatest tv series, and now DVD.  I can't wait to see the movie..cause i need some sort of closure because it was so shortlived
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Much has been written about later versions of The Great Gatsby on video and DVD and how Nelson Riddle's score had been deleted due to &quot;copyright&quot; laws.  I'm glad that now the original score is back....now, what can we do to have the double album soundtrack transferred to CD format?
B000002UKS|2.0|This album is totally middle of the road whether it be the boring and unimaginetive guitar riffs or the one dimensional lyrics and vocals of Dave grohl. Everlong is an instant classic but nothing else here bares repeated listens. Stick to your Nirvana and Pixies albums.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Thank goodness I listened to a friends before I put out my hard earned cash.  I would like to hear Brittany sing without all the backup acoustics (sp.?) and assistance she gets from anything other than her own voice.  I'd bet there isn't much there!  Sorry, I just don't get it.  I think her only talent is reinventing herself in the footsteps of Madonna.  She is pretty though, but that doesn't translate into good music.
B000092Q4U|3.0|I had heard alot of good things about this band, alot of promising things...and i'm not easily lead. i was talking to this kid at a party and he said that Lamb of God are the best band he's heard in years, he showed the same enthusiasm as i show whenever i say the same thing about Shadows Fall, a band he compared them to. I also read that the guitarists are both heavily influenced by Megadeth..another plus. but what did it for me was when i found out that Chris Poland, Ex-Megadeth axeman (killing is my business, peace sells) is featured on one of the songs...immediately i had to hear this band. I listened to half of it and wasn't that impessed. The singer sounds very bad...original-kinda, cool-not really. the guitar has the same kind of sound in every song, it seems like every song starts and ends with the same riffs over and over. the drumming was pretty cool though. there were, however, a few pretty good tracks that REALLY stood out 11th Hour, Bootscraper, A Devil in Gods Country, In Defense of Our Good Name, and Blood Junkie. I can see why people are completely insane about this band, but to me there's nothing really special about them. get if you enjoy the 'Screaming Devil' death metal vocals that you can't make out a word to, and rapid double bass pedals through out every song. in conclusion- while Lamb of God are good on some levels, they do not deserve to be used in the same SENTENCE as Shadows Fall.
B0000TB05A|5.0|Any true music lover will love this DVD, but if you are a true fan of the group, this is a 'must have' for your collection.  The DTS 5.1 Surround Sound audio is the preferred listening choice of this DVD if you have comparible equipment.  It is just amazing at the groups sheer performance and the crowds energy.  U2 definitely has not missed a beat over the years and they pour a lot into it for the home fans of Ireland.  Bono's vocals are on target and even The Edge lends a helping hand on several tracks.  Knowing that I will probably never get to see them live, this was all the more reason to have this.
0441009425|3.0|The first three hundred pages of this book are excellent and feature some brilliant narrative descriptions. Reynolds captures the feel of a dark, gothic future-world with ease, creating the sort of atmosphere reminiscent of 'Blade Runner' - that is, steam coming up from the vents, big advertisements featuring Asian geishas, and giant street based markets. <br />Reynolds' focuses on three characters - Khouri, a mercenary; Sylveste, a scientist; and Volyova, a mystery woman on board an enormous ship of devastating power. The characters are dealt with separately, and it is only until they come together that the book starts to lose its hold on the reader. The action thereafter becomes stationary and the narrative momentum really slows down, especially so in pages 300-400, and the climax is slightly underwhelming given the extensive build up towards it.<br />It's a well written book from a guy who obviously knows his stuff and knows it well. He writes like a scientist who's swallowed a dictionary. If you have either a) a limited vocabulary or b) no knowledge of science, chemistry or physics, this might be a bit of a hard nut to crack for you.
B00005LOUQ|3.0|Being no fan of post-In Living Color Jim Carrey, I expected to thoroughly detest this movie, and I didn't. It was watchable - a mite hypocritical, perhaps, being a (somewhat) buried morality tale about the crass commerciality of Christmas Present (if you'll excuse the pun), but all the same aimed to cash in on the Christmas cinema market.<br />Jim Carrey is, despite three inches of latex, fur and green spray paint, distressingly recognisable as Jim Carrey, and hardly recognisable as Dr Suess' Grinch: as hilarious as Jim Carrey usually is - if you like Jim Carrey - but not quite as irritating as Jim Carrey can be - if you don't - since the green prosthetics severly inhibit his annoying tendency to gurn.<br />Other than that, it's a fairly jaunty Christmas Tale, saved from utter unctuousness by a welcome vein of sardonism, but otherwise it should be left at that.
B000050FEN|3.0|I originally watched this film a few years ago, and found it too terrifying, and vowed never to watch it again. The ending was the main part that freaked me out. I bought it on DVD for Christmas and decided to take a chance and watch it again. To my surprise, I found it less scary, more enjoyable, and I didn't remember any of it. I'd obviously blocked a lot of it out!<br />There are a lot of clich&eacute;s in this film. The old cop near retiring partnered with the young cop, with a thirst for blood; you know something's going to happen to the young couple who look into each others eyes lovingly - especially when the wife can't find the right moment to tell her husband she's pregnant - and the fact it seems to be constantly raining. It always seems to be raining in cop films, which makes the film even darker.<br />All of the actors do a great job. Morgan Freeman is his usual self, never smiling, although it was great to hear him laughing in this film - I don't think I've ever heard that before. Brad Pitt was looking rather fine in this, especially when he got rained on. Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty and rather underused and there was some unusual chemistry between her and Brad - considering they were dating around this time.<br />This film isn't for the faint-hearted. I didn't find it as scary second time round, although I had a cushion handy just in case. OK, it's a story about murders based on the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath. So prepare yourself for the unexpected! Look out for the lust murder, as I found that to be the worst of the seven. Any female out there will be wincing, crossing her legs, and never wanting to let a guy near her again! Ouch to say the least.<br />This film will leave you guessing right up until the last minute - and at just two hours long, that's a lot of minutes to be guessing who the killer is! It's a good film, although I couldn't watch it more than once. Maybe again in another couple of years, and I haven't been refusing to watch it because of the ending which wasn't what I remembered/imagined it to be!aven't been refusing to watch it because of the ending which wasn't what I remembered/imagined it to be!
B0000A7W14|5.0|If you ever wanted a great example of pure cinema drama at its finest, &quot;Boyz N the Hood&quot; is it.  It didn't take long for me to completely involve myself during the viewing of this film.  It's powerful, sad, scary, and filled with heart.  This is one of those films that completely takes you by surprise by giving you something that you weren't expecting at all.  John Singleton's directorial debut doesn't fail to shine for one second in this human-drama powerhouse.<br />The film focuses around three friends who live in South Central, Los Angeles; a place where drugs, guns, and violence appears to be around every corner.  The three friends are Tre, Ricky, and Doughboy.  Tre's father has tried his best to raise Tre into becoming a real man; supplying him with knowledge and wisdom.  Ricky has dreams of being a professional football player while his brother, Doughboy, is always getting into some kind of trouble, whether it be with the law or the neighborhood gang-bangers.  In the end, the film is about choices and how every action can set off a chain of events.<br />In the exclusive documentary that's included on this 2-Disc Anniversary Edition DVD, John Singleton says that this was the movie he was born to make, and he's able to show us exactly that and nothing less.  Making the movie was taking a pretty big risk, as there was nothing quite like it on the market; however, that didn't stop him from delivering an incredible debut that really stands out from the rest.  The main misconception of this movie is that people are willing to automatically assume that the movie is violent and is only about violence (these being people who have never watched the movie) when in actuality, the film focuses more on the aftermath of violent acts rather than the actual acts being carried out.  The main focus is always on the characters, and Singleton does a superb job of never losing sight of that.  The story is delivered with undeniable care through the great direction of John Singleton.<br />Another factor that makes the film work the way it does is the superb cast behind it.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. gives it his all early on in his career and immediately shows promise of a talented actor.  Ice Cube proves that not only can he rap, but he can also act by giving life to his character of &quot;Doughboy.&quot;  Laurence Fishburne is amazing as Tre's father, as he gives an outstanding performance.  Everybody else is great as well.  This film really launched many careers of many of the actors that appear in this movie.<br />The 2-Disc DVD edition really does the movie justice as it's loaded with some very cool extras.  The movie looks and sounds great.  The DVD offers both widescreen and full screen versions of the film.  Extras that are included on this 2-Disc Anniversary Edition are theatrical trailers, commentary by John Singleton, an exclusive documentary, music videos, and deleted scenes.  The documentary was fascinating to watch and was extremely informative into what went on during pre and post-production.  Plenty of goodies for DVD enthusiasts all around.<br />&quot;Boyz N the Hood&quot; is a touching and exhilarating drama that plays on all of one's emotions.  The characters are very real and are easy to care for, and the story is well-structured and executed.  I cannot think of a single flaw that I ran across while watching the film.  It definitely has become a new favorite in a short amount of time.  There is real power within the film that has a unique effect on us when we watch it, or at least it did on me.  Definitely a film to check out if you have not already.Singleton.<br />Another factor that makes the film work the way it does is the superb cast behind it.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is my album of the year. It is completely flawless from start to finish. While I've heard some argue that the album is trying to do too much at once, I believe that it is quite the contrary. No song sounds the same and you have tons of different styles of music meshed into one giant album. Avenged Sevenfold's influence of metal, hardcore, punk, and 80's rock shines through at some point or another. &quot;Sounding The Seventh Trumpet&quot; was merely an average album in my mind, however, Avenged Sevenfold has returned in 2003 with a brilliant album with epic songs. Buy it now. I highly recommend it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The hugely anticipated 4th album from the Queen of Pop is a smash hit!<br />Me Against The Music: The catchy first single featuring Madonna. The beat is catchy, the lyrics are catchy, the arrangement, vocals, and hook are catchy too! This song could be the revitalization of Pop Music after the Rap/Hip-Hop explosion of 2002-2003. **** \\"We're almost there. Im feeling the vibe and I can't explain\\"<br />I Got That Boom Boom: An R&B infused dance song. Not the most lyrically complex song, but it is one of many new Britney songs that has her crossing over to a new genre known as Hip-Pop \\"I got that BOOM BOOM, that you want, I don't think you should wait one minute, it might be too late\\" (popularized by Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera). ***<br />Showdown: A slow dance song with many techno effects and breathy remarks from Britney (\\"oooh\\", \\"uuh-huuh\\" \\"yeaaah\\"). ***<br />Breathe On Me: More techno sound effects, but they work better here. This is possibly the most sexual song I've ever heard.A Ballad with a Beat. \\"Oooh dont stop cuz I'm half-way there...\\" <BR>                                                      ****<BR>Early Mornin: Another one of her medium tempo dance grooves. Has almost a jazzy feel to it. Nothing special about this one, but its worth a listen.\\"Bump Bump till the break of dawn, and it don't stop till the early morn\\" ***<br />Toxic: Easily the best song on the album. It is extremely catchy, with groovy electric an acoustic vibrations and effects. It feels like you are trapped in a room dripping with different shades of green and toxic yellow paint. The lyrics are smartly written. This is a kind of music I've never heard before \\"Baby cant u see? Im callin. A guy like you should wear a warnin\\" *****<br />Outrageous: Another catchy song. This song is about the surrealness of Britney Spears' lifestyle of fame, money, and papparazi. \\"Outrageous, when I move my body, outrageous when I'm at a party.\\"****<br />Touch of My Hand: A song about.... um.... Britney being lonely and... getting it on with her hand. It is very well written and daring, with mystical beats and effects that make her voice seem wispy and foggy. \\"Another day without a lover, the more I come to understand, the touch of my hand..\\" ****<br />The Hook Up: Seems like a filler song, the mismatched beats seem almost annoying to listen to. No need to list lyrics. \\"Back it up now, bump ya rump now\\" **<br />Shadow: A deep song about a relationship or something troubling her, not exactly sure. \\"It's only your shadow, nobody else\\" ***<br />Brave New Girl: A song about the *new* Britney. Very catchy, sounds very much like a Spice-Girls of Hillary Duff song. Lots of electro-techno effets again. \\"Who knew she could feel so alive, her outlooks changed, doesn't wanna behave, ain't it great to be a Brave Girl tonight\\" ***<br />Everytime: A breathy ballad, about Justin? maybe. Very emotion filled, sounds like she meant it \\"My weakness caused you your pain\\" ****<br />Me Against the Music RemiX: The coolest remix Ive ever heard. The tempo is slowed a little, but the vocals are mixed, and it just an overall really cool song. *****<br />Overall Rating: 3.7 (we'll just call it a 4)<br />This CD is a big change for Britney, and she handled it very well.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love the album each song is different. It's not like all CD's where aLL SONGS SOUND THE SAME.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have his first CD and love it!  Today I received the &quot;Closer&quot; CD and I have not stopped playing it. In every possible way I am astounded how this 22 year old man sings.  He is so passionate, expressive, and emotional with a voice like velvet.  I have translated the lyrics into English via the internet - no problem if you want to know the English words he is singing.  He has a wonderful selection of songs.  This is a must for the romantic. You won't be disappointed.  He is simply remarkable and wonderful!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My 9 year old daughter and I saw the broadway show in November and she couldn't wait for the release of the CD.  Well, she got it for christmas and hasn't stopped listening to it!  She has a few of the songs memorized.  It's just as it was in the theater.  Also bought the book to read.  We recommend the CD and if  you can get to the show -- go see it!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I was anxious to hear this album after falling in love with Pink's last release. I'm happy to say I enjoy TRY THIS even more. The rock guitars are fluid, crunching and everything in between. Pink's vocals are at times gentle, rough, raw, soulful and poppish. &quot;Trouble&quot; is a fantastic album opener. &quot;Last To Know&quot; is a fantastic rock song and shows that rock music can be melodical. &quot;Waiting For Love&quot; blows me away with the power of Pink's singing. &quot;Try To Hard&quot; is probably the best song on the album. &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot; reminds me of Blondie. In short, this album is great. I don't think Pink needed to use profanity, but that's just me. The music itself more than makes up for it though. Out of all the former teen queens I think Pink has done the best job of moving into a more adult sound. Take Pink up on her offer and TRY THIS.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Someone emailed me a E-Card previewing Whitney's One Wish CD. I thought to myself, Whitneys doing a Christmas Album how nice. While out shopping one day I noticed it and picked it up. I was skeptical about what i was going to hear when I put it in, but I WAS BLOWN AWAY. Everything from the production to her magnificent vocals is well put together. She sound so wonderful singing such joyous songs, and you can tell she really had her heart into it. She even does a little duet with her daugther Bobby Kristina, which is cute. IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD YET, GO OUT AND GET IT, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC FOR YEARS TO COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00005JLR6|5.0|Samantha Morton and Paddy Considine play a pair of devoted parents, Johnny and Sarah, who bring their daughters to start a new life \\"In America.\\"  Johnny and Sarah are virtually penniless and they take up residence in a tenement-like dwelling replete with drug addicts and other assorted deviants.  The daughters, Ariel and Christy, look upon the move as an exciting adventure to be savored.<br />Jim Sheridan directed and co-wrote this somewhat autobiographical movie, and he dedicates it to his brother, Frankie, who died at the age of ten.  Johnny and Sarah are also bereaved.  They lost their young son, and they have had a very hard time letting go of their deep feelings of sorrow and grief.<br />\\"In America\\" is a rich tapestry of sights and sounds, and there are strong elements of magical realism that add a touch of whimsy to the story.  Jim Sheridan explores a number of themes in his film, such as the difficulty of facing the death of a loved one, the grinding humiliation of poverty, the hopes and dreams that keep us going, and the relationships that ultimately redeem us.<br />Two sisters, Emma and Sarah Bolger, beautifully portray the young daughters.  These enchanting actresses contribute immeasurably to the film's effectiveness.  Djimon Hounsou is also a strong presence as a Nigerian neighbor with demons of his own who strikes up a friendship with the poor Irish family.<br />Although \\"In America\\" is a small movie in many ways, it has a big heart and top-notch performances.  Sheridan directs with warmth and compassion, and I get the feeling that he knows how hard it is for an impoverished immigrant to leave his native land and start a new life in strange surroundings.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|There are no words to describe how amazing Whitney Houston first ever Christmas album is... &quot;One Wish&quot; is one of the best christmas album out clear...Everyone heard the great reviews about &quot;One Wish&quot; and believe me its true and then some.

B000089RVX|4.0|I think its funny to see alot these people write &quot;over rated&quot; or &quot;trying to be like Link Park&quot; about evanescence on here. Obviously they have never heard evanescence's older songs. Fallen is a good cd for what it is but it will never compair to songs like <BR>&quot;so Close&quot; &quot;October&quot; &quot;Solitude&quot; &quot;Exodus&quot; &quot;Anywhere&quot; &quot;you&quot; &quot;Breath No More&quot; &quot;Further Away&quot; ... and the list goes on .... <br />Go pick up the album &quot;orgin&quot; , &quot;Not for your ears&quot; or even their demos ...alot of the demos have better than retail versions of some of the songs on &quot;Fallen&quot;. Then we will see someone write a review that is more true to what evanescence is.

0345452577|1.0|I have been a devoted reader of all things Kellerman (Jonathan and Faye) for a dozen or so years.  I was thrilled to learn there was a new book by Jonathan that was not an Alex Delaware story.  I very much enjoy series books and getting to know and like (or hate) the &quot;regulars&quot;.  Sort of a soap opera behind the current plot thing.  I was very excited to get to know the new characters in this book.  It typically takes me about 2-3 days to finish a Kellerman novel (his or hers) I worked on reading this book for about two weeks.  I made it about half way through this book.  When I realized I dreaded reading anymore of it and really wasn't caring what was going to happen next I gave up.  I tried skimming the second half reading a sentence here and there so I could find out the ending.  I still couldn't figure out what was going on.  It didn't matter though, by this point I really did not care how the book ended. I hope this will be a stand alone book and the characters will not continue on in another book.  All in all this book was a major disappointment.  Not at all of the calibar I have come to expect from Mr. Kellerman.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney's voice has matured and gained great depth and range. It is in terrific shape!! I have to admit that since I am not into x-mas music (I only know 2 of them), the album needed two listens to grow on me . Without further ado:<br />- The First Noel: When I listened to the sample I thought her voice was a bit airy, but now listening to the real deal, it is in great shape. The song is great, her delivery is great, and the music is good, (A)<br />- The Christmas Song: Great voice, well produced, and I loved the high note (flyyyyyy)... makes me wish for snow!! (A)<BR>- Little Drummer Boy: Bobby Krista.. CUTE!! ... Whitney with all the tenderness in the world &quot;sing baby... that's my baby&quot;.. I liked how the music picked up, and her voice is also in great shape!! (A)<br />- One Wish: The song started good, but then I lost total interest when she hit the chorus,, as several pointed out, the chorus needed some work, nonetheless her voice is very generous and the message is noble (B).<br />- O Holly Night: Faaaaalllll... Oh God the way she hit that note gave me the chills... this should be released as a special single &quot;how to sing&quot; sent to all those &quot;singers&quot; out there.<br />- I'll be home for x-mas: Something about the music I don't like, but otherwise the song sounds good, her voice is good, but I think the rest of the album overshadows this one. (B+).<br />- Deck The Halls/Silent Night: Amazingly, I LOVE this mix!!! Very nice, very energetic, nontheless, Whitney did hit those notes like nobody's business,,, sing it girl! (A)<br />- Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas: Talk about a timeless classic!! Good voice, but I thought the music was a bit loud at parts (i.e. her voice maybe should have been mixed a bit lowder). (A-).<br />- O Come Emanuel: OH MY GOD!! OH MY GOD!!

B0000CFW87|4.0|Another excellent effort from Josh Groban...cant say enough about this artist...I am not one to listen to this type of music for the most part, but when you put this CD in or the earlier CD, you are taken to a place that gives you great peace of mind and comfort...these songs are just beautiful...musically and lyrically. Only draw back is that it seems every other song is in Italian...therefore, it can be hard for the average listener to understand...even then..the songs are beautiful...great job!!!
B000000OPW|4.0|Tinderbox is an obvious adaption towards an 80s hard rock sound. The songs are tightly structured, precisely executed and carry a heavy guitar driven sound throughout. This isn't to imply that The Banshees have lost any of their dark theatrics (most of the songs deal with death after all), merely that they are steering it through a more accessible and melodically appealing route.<BR>Best Cuts: The Sweetest Chill, This Unrest, Cities In Dust.
B00005JM02|5.0|My son and I saw this movie in the theaters and also saw it again when it came out on DVD...loved it...the animation was top notch, and the charaters were so likable...for those that think that this movie was scary...or boring, dont really know entertainment. But everyone has an opinion...If you are looking for a great family film...rent this movie...
B000002LEU|5.0|I think it is a great place to start if you are just getting into Joy Division's music.  This disc features 17 great songs my personal favorites are Leaders of men  Digital Transmission She's lost control Atmosphere but really the whole disc is SUPERB!!  You can't go wrong with this collection buy it today.
B0000CFW87|1.0|If you have the first Groban CD, don't bother getting this one.  They are indistinguishable.  The man has a beautiful voice, now all he needs is someone who can choose his music.
B00005B36H|5.0|Now I know the title for this review may confuse people, they may say, 'why is he giving it 5 stars if he doesn't get it?'. Well, here is the answer. From a friend, I had been hearing of Tool's 'greatness' and 'complexity' for a long time, but i had listened to them a little and other than Schism, i really couldn't get into it. I even tried to listen to the album all the way through and i honestly could not do it. Some may call it boredom, but i don't think that was all of it. You see, Lateralus is the 1st Tool cd i have listened to, and i have heard before that i should check out their earlier work before moving on to this. Now, 'why i gave this 5 stars'. Although i don't always like it, I usually rate music on how 'I like it', not always the quality and overall difficulty of the music. Let me tell you, Tool is so talented in so many ways. From amazing vocals, to just-as-good guitars, add in an excellent bassist, and a simply incredible drummer, this, in my opinion, is Tool. So, just like the reviewer before me said, if your just looking for a little pool-time music, I do not recommend Lateralus. And 1 more thing, I respect that Tool isnt just trying to be another mainstream band that makes a lot of $$$$$$$. (Although i like a few of these bands). Maybe Tool is not for me, maybe their too complex, maybe i just don't agree with what they're saying. But, i can assure you, I will not give up on Tool. Because although I said &quot;I don't get it&quot;, Tool was successful in pulling me in to they're music.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|That is the best word to describe this CD! The final installment of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy gets the ultimate soundtrack experience! Ranks right up there with soundtracks from movies like &quot;Gods and Generals&quot; and the other &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films! Shore's compositions range from terrifying to beautiful, from excitement to emotional. Annie Lennox gives a performance of the song &quot;Into the West&quot; that is worthy of an oscar! If you love film music, then this one is for you! Grade: A+
B00005JMCN|3.0|When I was a kid I used to follow horse races a lot, so this movie understandably appealed to me, considering it's about the story of a short horse that beats the odds and becomes one of the United States' best race horses. Having become famous at a time when the country was coming out of the depression, it stood as an example of what the \\"small man\\" could hope for: there was an opportunity there for those who were willing to take a chance and fight for it. So there's more than the basic story of an animal and the people surrouding it. There's the whole country metaphor that keeps coming back once and again in the movie.<br />Overall, a feel-good movie but not an instant classic or an Oscar contender, if you ask me. Absolutely worth renting, but buying...? I'd argue...
B000066NW0|1.0|People have told me that the only reason I hate Avril is becuase I dislike her image. They say I should listen to her for her music. What they are missing is that her music is really not that good. Her voice isn't so bad, but after a few songs I get so annoyed I can't think. Her music to me just sounds corny. Her songs don't really have any depth at all. I just don't like the sound of them. Usually, the gutair is my favorite part of a song, but not in this album. It just sounds . . .blah. So, in conclusion, I do not like Avril becuase her music is terribly bad. Sorry.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think this is the best album by far by Britney Spears. My favorite songs are Toxic,Showdown, and many more. This album shows how she's grown up into an adult as well as an entertainer.
B00003CXI1|2.0|The movie is a well-done attempt to condense the book into a watchable, visual version. However, much of the magic is convoluted and the many of the characters are made stale and wooden, partly because it is so difficult to condense this huge and irreplaceable book into a movie. One associate of mine described the acting as &quot;psychotic.&quot; I give the girl who played Hermione Granger a thumbs-up and if you need to know the story for class, watching the movie is a good way to get it fast. But it won't be nearly as enjoyable as reading the book itself.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|As the first track on TOT got started, I was amazed at how blatantly &quot;Metallica-ish&quot; it sounded. Not that I didn't like it; on the contrary I did and this whole album rocks hard like a typical Metallica album would. To all who have panned this album because they think it lacks the creativity of their earlier efforts I have one comment to make....a poor effort from DT is better than 99% of the other progressive rock outfits today. Besides, Petrucci's guitar work is always worth the purchase price!
B00013F35I|1.0|If you spent the night in the lobby at the concession stand, this is how the concert would have sounded. I see his lips move but I can't tell what he's saying. Max slams the snare but it sounds like he's playing with brushes. Someone keeps turning the volume up and down. What the heck is going on here? This sounds like one big mono mess! `Live in NYC' has clear sound and separation...neither of which can be said for this DVD. I got this for Christmas from my fiancé and I think we got Scrooged! Some heads should roll for this.<br /> We were lucky to see Bruce at Fenway Park this past summer, it was great, even the sound was pretty good considering that it's a baseball park not Symphony Hall. This DVD will only tarnish the memory of that night.
0446530891|3.0|As an aspiring female Federal Agent myself, I appreciated the character of Michelle Maxwell. Most authors write about Joan's in federal law enforcement. Thank you for the breath of fresh air in Michelle's character. <BR>This was my first Baldacci read. I enjoyed the speed, the suspense and the genre. I do have to agree with other posters - some of the twists or characters introduced were a bit confusing. Still don't know the purpose of Bob Scott? But I enjoyed it for a purely entertaining mystery!
B00006BTCA|5.0|It's Christmas and because it is Christmas I was appointed to the task of drying dishes. After being told by my younger sister to stop whistling, and after resisting the urge to slap her I decided to put on a little music on the computer in the next room. While browsing my collection of albums ripped onto my hard drive and noting that I've been listening to Radiohead a little too much (if possible) lately, I decided to put on this album. That was probably the best decision I made all day. I'd made some poor decisions earlier in the day (i.e. choosing dark meat over white meat) but putting on this album while drying the dishes most definately made up for that lapse of judgement. With songs like &quot;PDA&quot; and &quot;Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down&quot; you can have a toe-tapping good time whether you are drying dishes or shucking corn. I would like to note that I wanted to give this album 4 1/2 stars but there are no half stars. So I decided to round up. Good album, and I'd like to add that it did not cause me to drop and break one dish. Hooray Interpol.
B00005B4GU|5.0|AMNESIAC RULES! no seriously, this is one of the most intriguing and most experimental cd's i have ever listened to. You must have an open mind or else you won't understand it. The haunting music makes you feel like ur on a psychodelic journey into the unknown. this is way better then Kid A. Favourite songs on this album are: I Might Be Wrong, You and Whose Army, and packt like sardines in a tin can, wait what am i saying all the songs are the best! its best to just start from the first song and let it play from beginning to end. F**K'N AWESOME!!
B0000DBJDM|3.0|I give this DVD three stars only because despite the edit here, it is still Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii and as such is an excellent film, artistically and musically.  No Floyd collector should go without it.  But ordinarily I would give it 5 stars.  What's the difference?  This particular edition is crass commericialism at its worst, trying to milk the consumer for a product that he or she has probably already purchased in at least two formats.  If a director's cut is an unabridged, &quot;complete&quot; version of a film as the director originally intended it before, say, the ratings commission got their hands on it, then this is anything but a director's cut.  Instead, the original film has been spliced with rocket launches, computerized planets, and the cool original typefaces that once introduced the songs have been replaced with a more new-agey font with a very low budget computer video-editing type effect overlayed.  On the upside, the original version is also included on this as well as some press on the film, a breif director's commentary, and some album covers.  However, bewilderingly, the first menu the viewer encounters is the language menu.  Most DVDs I know bury that feature someplace less obtrusive.  In any case, yes, it's nice to have this on DVD.  But to advertise this as a &quot;director's cut&quot; is nothing short of false advertisement.
B00005LB9O|5.0|This is one of those compilations that got into my head and heart right away. I'm so grateful to have heard this band, I think they are the next Radiohead.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I love this show. I will own this season because I eventually want the complete set. But this season is way overpriced for the number of episodes and that makes it deserve this rating of 1 star! Since the season was short (September 11, Sarah Jessica Parker pregnancy etc), I agree with others it would have been more cost-effective to release Season 5 along with the Season 6 set in one package.
B00005JM0B|2.0|If you enjoyed  T1 &amp; T2 then just wait there is still time for you to be disappointed. T3 could not be more so. It falls short completely on story line. Compaired to T2 it falls way short on special effects. Rise of the Machines, Fall of the Series!
B0000CD5I6|2.0|i listened to this and id have to say this is a horrible cd for jethro. i know them very well i have been a fan since day 1. this cd has no guitar. if you are a fan of tull for their ROCK music dont buy this there is like no electric guitar in this cd. its mostly flute music. i hope jethro comes back to rock soon because after track 5 of this cd i hate it
B000024D4R|4.0|True, Gilmour's guitar here is not as epic-sounding as it was on &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; or &quot;The Wall,&quot; but it's pretty darn good.  And while Waters may not have as good of a voice as Gilmour, he does a good job.  In addition, Waters' lyrics are in top form here.<BR>     Pink Floyd have 3 enormous classic albums: &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;The Wall,&quot; and &quot;Animals.&quot;  &quot;Dark Side&quot; is the trippy one, &quot;The Wall&quot; is the thinking one, and &quot;Animals&quot; is just plain scary--terrifyingly accurate dipiction of humans as a race, along with some of the best cynical anti-establishment and, even moreso, anti-religious lyrics.<br />&quot;The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want<BR>He makes down to lie<BR>Through pastures green he leadeth me the silent waters by<BR>With bright knives he releaseth my soul<BR>He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places<BR>He converteth me to lamb cutlets<BR>For lo, he with great power and great hunger<BR>When cometh the day we lowly ones<BR>Through quiet reflection and great dedication<BR>Master the art of karate<BR>Lo, we shall rise up<BR>And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water&quot;<BR>                                      -Roger Waters<br />Decide for yourself.

GREAT CD
B00008EY9G|2.0|I'm a very big fan of movies that are suspensful and have a twist to them.  But, this one was extremely disappointing.  I won't be a jerk and give the ending away, but the movie itself was great up until the ending.  I gave it two stars only because of the cast and the fine acting they did.  The ending was sooooo dumb that I knocked down the 3 stars that would've gave it a 5!<br />I don't recommend this movie at all and just want to say &quot;Rent&quot; it or wait 'til it comes on cable.  DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!
B00007LTIA|1.0|Well, heres the story. An uncle of mine gave me this for christmas 'cuz I love Radiohead. He said that I would like this too. Boy was he wrong!<br />Radiohead are genuiuses this is CRAP. Every song is half an hour long and BORING. As if that wasn't enough they put on some extra songs (rehearsals or something) that are also LONG and BORING.<br />If you want interesting music that rocks check out anything by Radiohead, Incubus, Staind, Limp Bizkit and Marylin Manson. This is just JUNK!<br />Say NO to 'Yes'!!
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I know Whitney can sing but in the past couple of years she has not been up to par. One Wish is a prime example of her singing woes. Not the best but it is better then her recent past live performances. <BR>Hope Whitney can get her full voice back. She was once the best!
0385504209|5.0|Great infusion of actual history and story telling.  I learned a lot from this book, which suprised me.  I kept thinking that it was all fluff that the author created, then when I did some research, it was all based on reality.  This book does take a decidedly negative position on the catholic church.  I wouldn't recommend this book to religious zealots. They will likely spend the whole time getting mad at the authors attacks on Catholicism, rather than looking at his research objectively, and enjoying the story.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.
B00004Z459|3.0|Linkin Park are not a particularly creative or powerful band musically, but don't pass them up entirely. Having once been a massive fan, I can safely say their music gets old pretty fast. Still, Hybrid Theory is worth checking out. A few of the songs on it (most notably &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; and &quot;In the End&quot;) play with rhythm- and vocal-driven music while still keeping a rock-like feel. Basically, buy this album if you don't have strong musical tastes and want something that will satisfy your need for something at least slightly different from what you're used to. Also, it's a safe gift for someone you don't know very well.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I have been waiting impatiently for this film to come out. It had some of my favorite actors, Toby McQuire and Jeff Bridges (who is not used often enough in good movies!) in it, and it was a horse story. I remember being a little girl and reading all the horse books I could get my hands on. Black Beauty and all of Walter Farley's books, and I did read a very short, illustrated one on Seabiscuit. <br />This is a magnificent movie. Many of the panorama views that are done with no voice or talking remind me a bit of The Titanic but with a happier ending. This was truly the meeting of four very damaged beings: 3 men and a battered horse. Their coming together, and the support and care they gave each other led to a winning combination of strength and courage that could not be beat. <br />The cinematography of the movie is absolutely stunning. Bridges is does his fine job that was seen in so many previous movies...how can the Academy and filmmakers miss giving him more outstanding material to work with I will never know. The supporting cast and a very, very thin Toby Mcguire fill out this beautiful film in their parts. I plan to watch this film many times on rainy Saturdays, partly because it is beautiful and because it was uplifting (and I don't gamble!). I can understand how so many people in the U.S. who were in the throes of the Depression found the story of Seabiscuit to be uplifting, and allow them to hope that they too could survive and could also thrive, given an opportunity to do so (which many of the social programs instigated by FDR did do and did build the national infrastructure of highways and national forestry projects/dams that we still depend on). <br />Karen Sadler
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality is Sabbath at it's best, thick sludgy guitars, doomy lyrics, and Ozzy's banshee wail. As usual throughout the album, the rhythm section of drummer Bill Ward and bassist Geezer Butler is tight. Master is kicked off with Sweet Leaf, which is driven by a sludgy riff, and Ozzy's lyrics about his love for marijuana. It's followed by After Forever, a song about people's doubts about Christianity, and whether one is prepared to go the grave without a belief in a god. Embryo is a short acoustic track which serves as a lead in to Children of a Grave. Children is a track that rides a thick crunchy riff and great singing by Ozzy. Lord of this World is also another great track with a slowly churning riff and a good vocal as well. Solitude is a decent track with introspective lyrics, but not among the best on the album. The album closer kicks from start with a doomy riff and great lyrics about the death of the earth from human pollution. Master of Reality is a great album, which is either better or on the same level as the classic Paranoid. Any Sabbath fans who havent picked this up by now stop delaying.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This album is terrible ! Don't buy this crap !
0804106304|5.0|I felt that the main theme of the Joy Luck Club had little to do with &quot;Americans don't understand Asian Americans and the chinese culture&quot; and was really about the experience of being an immigrant and the struggle to balance both parts of who you are. <BR>Having grown up in a family with two immigrant parents from two different both non-asian countries, I still felt as though I could really relate to this book. <BR>The novel holds immense literary value and I have fallen in love with every single one of Tan's novel's thusfar!
B0000DCGT0|5.0|What an awesome movie!  The historical insets which give the movie its historical context are just fantastic to set the mood for a second chance winner.<br />Jeff Bridges is superb in his role, the character seems to fit his personna so well, smooth and yet energetic and passionate. Chris Cooper does an equally admirable performance as the remarkable trainer Tom Smith and Tobey Macguire as Red Pollard is very good.<br />This real story captivates and motivates since it's about the underlying potential in everyone to achieve, while others just want to suppress.  Howard is such a case, and sees this in a trainer, a horse and a jockey, after finding it in his own crumbling life.<br />The cineamotography and music are excellent and fit the storyline snugly.<br />This is one to be watched multiple times.
B00005JM02|4.0|I have always purchased such Disney animated DVDs that were the classics I grew up with such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty, etc, released as a Special Edition or Collector's Edition.  Finding Nemo I bought partly for the Disney name, but also because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  I was very surprised by how much I liked this film!  Disney films are surprisingly a little more tragic and frightening than I remembered, but also a lot more funny.  Dory (Ellen Degeneres) is definitely much-needed comedic relief for some of the rather intense &quot;getaway&quot; sequences.  Finding Nemo I don't think I would recommend for a child under 5 (the sharks and intensity of some scenes might scare some little ones).  <br />However I think this film was beautifully and imaginitively written.  Each different type of fish had its own personality and &quot;cultural&quot; differences, which merely introduces examples of tolerance and multiculturalism.  If you have NO idea what I'm talking about, go buy the DVD, it's really worth it.
0385504209|5.0|In The Da Vinci Code, author Dan Brown combines murder, intrigue, religion, and the art world and comes up with an exciting read.  The story opens in the Louvre, where the curator has just been killed.  His granddaughter, Sophie, a police agent, and Robert Langdon, a famous American &quot;symbologist&quot; become involved in the case - at first to help solve the crime, and then, as the prime suspects.  The crime is connected to two religious organizations; one's mission is to guard the secret truth about the Holy Grail, and the other's job is to keep that information from ever being told.  The action moves from Paris to Rome and on to London in a frantic race to not only solve the murder, but possibly to change the course of Christianity forever.<br />I loved the first one-third of this book!  It was so well-written, I had goosebumps and could not put it down.  The characters are interesting and the plot (in the beginning) is dynamite.  The middle section - which explains the role of the Grail - got bogged down in the details.  The author is exceptionally well-versed in the history of the Opus Dei and Priory of Sion societies.  (Members of the later have included such illuminati as Da Vinci, Botticelli, and Newton over the centuries.)  The problem is, he spends too much time explaining their theories and the action and suspense that characterized the beginning of the book are lost.  The final third, where the story moves to London, regains the original excitement and fast pace and it is, overall, a very good story.<br />Brown knows his art history, and I couldn't help but look up many paintings and artists as he described their significance to the plot.  Those who have been to Paris or London will enjoy revisiting those cities here.  I learned a lot about art, religion, history, and even word origins from reading The Da Vinci Code.  I think it would make an exciting movie.  I heartily recommend it.
B00006690G|1.0|THIS CD IS WELL I WILL JUST EXPLAIN IT TO YOU HE IS VERY OFFENSIVE IN SOME OF HIS LYRICS.  HE TALKS ABOUT HIS MOM IN THE WORST WAYS YOU COULD THINK OF BUT I HAVE NEVER MET HER SO I WOULDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT SHE IS LIKE,BUT YOU STILL SHOULDN'T TELL THE WHOLE WORLD ABOUT IT.  AND THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CD THAT IS NOT GOOD IT IS JUST LIKE YOU HEAR IT AND YOUR LIKE THAT IS OK BUT I WOULD NEVER BUY IT. NOW ON THE OTHER HAND HE IS KINDA SWEET ABOUT HIS SONG ABOUT HALIE AND HIS SONG WITH HALIE BUT EVEN WITH THE SONG WITH HALIE HE SAYS CUSS WORDS AND HIS DAUGHTER IS GONNA HEAR THAT YA KNOW? SO IF I WERE YOU I WOULD ONLY LISTEN TO THIS CD WHEN I COULD GET THE CHANCE IF MY FRIEND HAD IT BUT I WOULD NOT BUY IT FOR MYSELF BECUZ IT WOULD JUST GET ALL DUSTY SITTING AROUND.
038572179X|4.0|Ian McEwan's novel \\"Atonement\\" (2001) has received deserved praise.  The writing style is varied and superb, the pace of the novel carefully controlled, and the characters live from the inside.  The book explores many large themes, the nature of guilt and atonement, tne nature of love, the nature of the writing of fiction, war, social change and social classes, and many others. The variety and breadth of these themes could easliy produce a sprawling, confused work.  But in \\"Atonement\\" the themes are carefully controlled and integrated.<br />The book begins on an English upper-middle class estate in 1935. The protagonist is a 13 year-old precocious girl, Briony Tallis, who already has the ambition to be a writer.  She witnesses an erotic flirtation between her older sister Cecilia Tallis, and Robbie Turner, a brilliant young man from an underprivileged backround (and of uncertain paternity) whose education has been sponsored by Briony's father.  The plot unfolds slowly and inexorably with great descriptive detail and attention to character.  At the conclusion of the first section Briony makes a false accusation against Robbie which results in Robbie's imprisonment.  The rest of the book is the working-out of this carefully-laid opening chapter.<br />The outstanding features of this novel include the change of voicing and of pacing in each of the four sections. Each of the first three parts of the book are written in the third person but the voicing in each section is significanly and purposefully different.<br />The first and longest section, which I have discussed above, is written in the tone of the omniscent narrator -- one assumes it is the voice of the novelist unfolding his story.  The second section of the book is set early in WW II with the British evacuation of France at Dunkirk just prior to the German air attack on Brittain.  The story continues in the third person, but the pace and drive of the story increases rapidly.  We are witnessing the British troups on their retreat to Dunkirk with the horrors of battle.  The story is written, we soon learn, in the voice of Robbie Turner, who has been released from prison on condition that he enlist in the war effort.<br />The third chapter is set in London just before the air raids.  We meet Briony Tallis again who is full of remorse for her false testimony years before against Robbie.  Briony is becoming a nurse, (her sister Cecelia is also a nurse) and there are gripping scenes of wounded and dying men in the hospital returning from combat. There are some wonderful secondary characters in this section, including Sister Drummond, the supervisor of the young probationer nurses, and Mrs.Jarvis, a crusty British landlord in the best Victorian tradition.  In this section of the book, we learn that Briony is continuing her efforts to write and she is also seeking forgiveness for the guilty deed of her girlhood.  As the chapter progresses, we see that it is written from the perspective of Briony herself even though it continues in the third person.<br />The final section of the book is set in 1999 and is very short.

The story is written, we soon learn, in the voice of Robbie Turner, who has been released from prison on condition that he enlist in the war effort.<br />The third chapter is set in London just before the air raids.  We meet Briony Tallis again who is full of remorse for her false testimony years before against Robbie.  Briony is becoming a nurse, (her sister Cecelia is also a nurse) and there are gripping scenes of wounded and dying men in the hospital returning from combat. There are some wonderful secondary characters in this section, including Sister Drummond, the supervisor of the young probationer nurses, and Mrs.Jarvis, a crusty British landlord in the best Victorian tradition.  In this section of the book, we learn that Briony is continuing her efforts to write and she is also seeking forgiveness for the guilty deed of her girlhood.  As the chapter progresses, we see that it is written from the perspective of Briony herself even though it continues in the third person.<br />The final section of the book is set in 1999 and is very short.  The voicing shifts again, this time to the first person, and the story and the novel achieve a difficult closure.<br />This novel is ultimately a careful, well-crafted and reflective work which speaks eloquently of the power of writing to transform reality and of the still more important power of human love.
B00009APK1|2.0|I read these books as a teen 20 years ago, and when I saw the movies coming out I was very excited, so I read the books again to prepare.  The Fellowship of the Ring was fairly true to the book save some Aragorn/Arwen stuff, so I was very pleased with the first installment and fired up for The Two Towers.  I just rented the DVD and it was a huge disappointment.<br />I am no Tolkien geek or anything, but I fail to see the need for all the plot changes.  If you knew nothing of the books I think these movies would be hideously boring. For example, you can barely understand a word Treebeard says.  If you hadn't read the book you would not be able to follow what the heck he is even talking about (would you know what an &quot;entmoot&quot; is? Of course not).  All the other plots and characters would be impossible to follow as well.  So that leaves the people who read the books to be most of the paying customers seeing the movie over and over again.  So why not just keep the plot the same?  As I watched it I kept saying WHAT?  I don't remember a Warg battle on the way to Helm's deep.  I don't remember Aragorn falling over a cliff.  I don't remember Elves showing up at Helm's Deep.  I don't remember an orc chasing Merry and Pippin into Fangorn and Treebeard saving them.  I don't remember all the endless Arwen scenes that are totally pointless.  I don't remember a martial-arts style fight in the Golden Hall.  Most of all, the total 180 degree treatment of the Faramir chapter is unbelievable!  I was totally disgusted at that point.<br />I am disappointed to read all these rave reviews by people.  I was hoping true Tolkien fans would be ready to revolt, but it seems that no one cares.  If the books are so boring that you have to liven up the plots by making all these MAJOR changes, then why are they timeless classics read by millions, and will probably go down as some of the most popular books in the history of literature?  I am sure Peter Jackson could care less, and in the end he was probably right anyway, judging by the $$$ the films have grossed.  But I still think he could have made just as much without butchering the story. I was really excited to see this movie, but now I do not even know if I want to see Return of the King.  What's the point?  It's not the same story.end he was probably right anyway, judging by the $$$ the films have grossed.

B00009TB5G|5.0|The Lord of the Rings trilogy is probably the best film trilogy ever. I mean just think about it. All other film trilogies fall apart on the second or third film. The Godfather trilogy was good with the exception of part III. And lets face it, Return of the Jedi wasnt the best movie either. The Matrix 2 and 3 sucked. I could go on and on. But the Lord of the Rings movies are all awesome and each, in my opinion, are worthy of Best movie from the oscars. <br />Here are my opinions on each film.<br />FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING: this actually is probably my favorite of the three movies. I personally think this one has the most sense of actual fantasy and adventure. I love how it starts out so peaceful in the shire and ends so gloomy and depressing at Amon Hen. This film also has the most moments where it lets you watch in awe at all the amazing environments. It got 13 nominations at the academy awards. Is that not awesome?? My favorite scene in the whole trilogy is the treck through Moria. This is a great movie!!! 10/10<br />TWO TOWERS: This is probably my least favorite of the three. There is so much talking and its kinda boring until the battle of Helms Deep. This film strays the farthest from the books. I mean come on! Frodo never sets foot in Osgiliath in the whole trilogy! The extended version is very good and i personally they should have left the Boromir and Faramir scene in the original cut. This is still a great movie. 8/10<br />RETURN OF THE KING: This was an awesome movie!!!!!!!! Gollum is my favorite character and I think it was awesomely portrayed. The Pelennor fields scene was awesome! Shelobs lair was aesome! The battle of the black gate was awesome!  This movie was awesome! 9/10<BR>Go see it now!
B000003TAR|5.0|This CD is truly amazing.  Where else can you find lyrics with such meaning then on In Utero?  You can't.  Kurt's superb song writting really shows in this album.  The songs are dark and depressing, especially on \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", \\"Dumb\\" \\"Rape me\\", and \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\".  Even 10 years later this CD is still being heard all over the world.  I love it and i'm sure you will too :)
B000056N8X|1.0|Maybe i'm just stuck on nostalgia, but there is no way this film is a proper sequal to Highlander. First of all, it is too inconsistent &amp; pays no respect to the original film or to Connor Macleod.  This films storyline is almost as pathetic as Highlander 2.  There is no purpose for it &amp; its plays out like an extended episode of the tv series.  The title &quot;Endgame&quot; which suggest the end of it all, is nothing of the sort as it is obvious that there are still immortals left. The character of Duncan is play like a lost soul, &amp; the character of Connor (the original Highlander) is butchered.  This film is complete blasphemy to the original.  The one star I gaveit is based in the touching scene between Duncan &amp; Connor.  It is the one decent scene in this film.  There can be only one, but this is not it.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is easily the Greatest pop-punk Cd ever.  It blows Green Day's 1994 release &quot;Dookie&quot; out of the water.  Every song is incredible.  There are catchy Bass Lines, fast energetic drum beats, and awesome but simple guitar riffs.  The vocalists (Mark and Tom) are amateur but what do you expect from a punk band?  I have had this CD for over four years now and I never get tired of hearing it.  It just cheers me up and makes me remember when Blink 182 wasn't trying to be all EMO.  I LOVE this Cd.  If there were 10 stars I would give it that.  You can't live without this CD.<br />Props to Blink 182
B00006F83Y|5.0|This may not be as hugely successful as Limp Biscuit but its much better by a vast difference. While when the new millenium began new rock groups began to be introduced screaming their way (or hopelessly rapping) to the top of the charts. Heavy riffing guitars and screaming vocals os suicide notes and love letters were the main theme of the over-populated heavy punk bands from 2000-2003. Queens of the Stone Age step away from piercing screams to make a record of master heavy alternative. Although I am not a huge fan of this band this record definatly earned a spot on my list of The Best CD's ever. I was drawn in to the band from thier first single, Go With the Flow with was an excellent and refreshing change from modern day rock. The low tune of bass guitars and drums set this single as high-standards for the album. I love the lead-singers low sultry voice which brings emotion and and excellent captivation into each track. Song for the Deaf has to be the best song on this album. This album is dark and alive at the same time with so much completion its hard to find a mistake. The second single, No One Knows, is definitly another smash hit and a change from the rock today with the deeply low guitar melodies. <br />Overall I was completely satisfied by this record and listened to it over and over and over again. This packages very good song-writing, a low lead voice, and moody music much different and much better from the so-called 'hard rock'.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin is an awesome artist and I have nothing but good to say about him. His soulful voice and smooth lyrics inspire me as an artist and as a person. I absolutely love every song on the album. Chariot, the title track, is a song that rocks and rolls and really digs under your skin. This song is the reason I bought the album in the first place. I saw him perform it on the Sharon Osbourne show and wow, he's so awesome. I Don't Wanna Be, the theme song for One Tree Hill, is equally powerful. It's more of a rocker song and just makes you really want to sing along. This is the first song I heard of Gavins. My other favorites are Chemical Party because of it's catchy lyrics, Belief because of it's wonderful metaphors, Nice to Meet You Anyway because I really relate to that, and Just Friends because it also applies to my personal life. I highly recommend this cd. It's a must have for anyone's cd collection.
B0000013G9|5.0|TLC emerged into the music world with thier fun and dance beat infested debut but came back with a powerful hit. I consider this album one of the best albums ever. TLC is erotic, raw, sassy, and just like the title states; crazy, sexy, and cool. On the excellent sophmore effort they blend live instruments with smooth funky soul dripping in hot wet passionate lyrics. My favorite song on this CD has to be \\"Red Light Special\\" because of its sexy lyrics and erotic vibe to it. TLC isnt afraid to talk about sex and female plesure which is dominated by males. Another favorite is, of course, the huge hit \\"Waterfalls\\". It tackles serious subjects such as AIDS and the violence of the hood. Overall TLC emerges from a cocoon into a butterfly of soul and funky dance beats blended with T-Boz's sultry voice, Chili's soaring vocals giving each song a lift, and Left Eye's catchy raps. I strongly recommend this CD for some excellent R&B by an excellent, sexy, sassy, erotic, crazy, cool, funky, and powerful trio of classy ladies.
B00000DHR0|4.0|I love this album. Celine was able to convey the spirit of Christmas. Hey and the huge Dion family was there to support the effort. If you look at the last page of the CD cover you'll see the family photo. Also the last track of the CD &quot;Cloches du Hameau&quot; is a group hug type of thing where all Dions sing together. <br />Of course the CD opens with O Holy Night, and of course there's Ave Maria, and O Come All Ye Faithful. These Christmas classics are presented in a rather classical manner paying the trubute to the great unrealized operatic ambition of Celine to sing opera. <br />But still my favorite track is John Lennon's &quot;Another Year Has Gone By&quot;. I just love it. If you are not annoyed yet of listening to this CD in all shopping mall and department stores in the world during the holiday season (which attests to the success of the undertaking), get yourself a copy. You won't be disappointed.
0312263120|3.0|After reading (and being delighted with) The DaVinci Code, I picked this one up.  I was slightly disappointed with it.  The characters were not that well-developed, the plot was slightly unbelivable, and the ending was completely ridiculous.  If you're looking for an entertaining read that isn't very deep I'd recommend this.  It's written okay but with very little research.  However, if you are looking for the mental stimulation and excitement of the DaVinci code skip this one.
B000031XCR|4.0|In essence, this CD is a first &quot;best of&quot; album of Celine Dion. However, along with such classics like &quot;The Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;Power of love&quot; and &quot;My heart will go on&quot; from Titanic movie which launched Celine's international career, you'll find new tracks like dancy &quot;That's the way it is&quot;, and a new old &quot;All the way&quot; with Frank Sinatra. No worries, late Sinatra appears recorded in sync with Celine's voice. Celine says that Sinatra is her and Rene's favorite singer, and that she always wanted to sing a duet with him, but never had a chance, until now. <br />If you look at all those 16 tracks on this album, you'll see what was Celine's career before she really made it big with Titanic. Celine was known for her theme songs for movies. For instance, &quot;Beauty and the beast&quot; - has been recorded for a Disney animated movie, &quot;Because you loved me&quot; was recorded for &quot;Upclose and personal&quot; featuring Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer, &quot;My heart will go on&quot; - a love song for Titanic of course, &quot;Then you look at me&quot; recorded for the movie &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; featuring robot Robin Williams, and the last, but not least &quot;Live&quot; is a song from a hugely popular French musical &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;. <br />The bottomline, the album is a great compilation of oldies (yeah, we can now say that with regards to Celine who's been singing now for more than 20 years!) and new songs. The live performance of songs from this album happened in New York's Radio City Music Hall. CBS taped it. That night Celine was a darling, and I spent 3 hours waiting for her on the steps of the St. Regis hotel after the show. She never showed up. Well, I've got the album :-)
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Almost everything one wants to know. The pluses are the huge amounts of details shown and the negatives are that there is a lot of repetition of information in the audio commentaries.  In the supplemental background information each individual is identified as they come on screen each time so it is easy to keep track of their role in the process.<BR>Alien (1979) still holds up as a very scary movie and Aliens (1986) as a rip roaring thrill ride.  As indicated at the start of each DVD the comments within do not reflect the comments of the film company, etc., and that is certainly true for Aliens3.  The background and commentary cleary spell out the turmoil behind the film and what happens when 'suits' exert detailed control over the film, and shooting without a finished script.  The major emphasis on this audio commentary is on how the look of the film was conceived.  Also, as noted, Alien3 had only one digital effect.<BR>Alien Resurrection is the only film with any amount of computer digital effects and this process was in its infancy.  Miniatures, rod puppets and hand puppets were used and there is mention of the rotoscope process to remove the rods, etc., but no background on how this actually worked. Alien Resurrection has good background features, especially on the water scenes, and the audio commentary was primarily on the look of the film.  The 200 years (chronological) between the 3rd and 4th film saw the demise of the 'evil' fictional Wayland-Yutani Corp.  The company that bought them out is mentioned by name, and some may find this name amusing, and others perhaps more scary than the Alien Queen.<BR>Of the four film commentaries, I enjoyed the one for Aliens best, especially the comments by Bill Paxton.<BR>Of the nine DVD's, I found a technical glitch on disc 1, with two quick and successive freezes, duplicated on a DVD payer with progressive scan and one without that ability.<BR>I wasn't initially happy to have to purchase all four films when I only felt strongly about two.  This collection has made me appreciate the last two better.<BR>Clearly Alien (1979) is superior.  The next films were not meant to be sequels but as new treatments of the menace.<BR>This collection is a must for fans of SciFi and for anyone who appreciates a superb movie (Aliens, 1979) or a great thrill ride, (Aliens, 1986).<BR>By the way, be prepared to see a lot of cigarette smoking, in the movies and in the background features.
B0000AUHPB|3.0|\\"The Italian Job\\" is another movie that begins with a lot of promise and dwindles as the clock rolls on-fortunately capped at 90 minutes or so.  The opening sequence, as the credits roll, is a memorable scene that caught me completely off guard.  I enjoyed the young Michael Caine's acting.  His charm and personality definitely help carry the film throughout its length.  The quirky setup of the film is quite inventive, including a job that is not planned from the ground up, but rather inherited after the death of its mastermind.  The film itself does not focus upon the heist; rather, it chooses to direct its attention to the getaway.  This makes up the extended action sequence of the film, starring the little minis.  The chase sequence is quite enjoyable to watch and I waited the entire movie to see it.  I particularly liked the inventive end to the chase sequence and the comedy that is woven into the driving.<br />\\"The Italian Job\\" does not take itself seriously, and neither do I.  The ending, as the documentary implies, is the ultimate cliffhanger.  I wasn't sure what to make of it-or whether or not I enjoyed it.  I can say that I appreciated its originality and I'm glad the film did not descend into a classic heist ending with everyone patting each other on the back.  You'll have to watch it for yourself to decide.<br />As far as comparing it to the remake, you just simply cannot do it.  The films are miles apart and have very little in common.  I believe that comparing them would be pointless and unfair.  See them both-just don't expect a true remake.
0345452577|4.0|After reading some of the reviews, I was expecting the worst.  However, with the exception of the scence at the dinner, this book kept my interest and was a refreshing change.  Kellerman is one of my favorite authors, but I do have to admit his last few Delaware books were a little bogged down with his romantic life.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden have always had a penchant for romantic, epic and, lets' face it, often preposturous lyrics accompianed by often repetitive and lengthy music featuring assailing guitars, crashing drums, same old same old bass patterns and operatic vocals.  But almost no one has ever done metal music better or with more feeling than the aging rockers.  They play with life and vigor, especially after the reaqusition of classic vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith on 2000s' \\"Brave New World.\\"  <br />\\"Dance of Death\\" Maidens 13th studio offering, finds the boys of Maiden still in top form, picking up where \\"World\\" left off.  Producer Keven Shirley is back, streamlining the band's sound but allowing the triple guitar attack more room for volume an presence while showcasing all three guitarists' exceptional talents.  Guitarist Dave Murray has been with the band from the very start (and is my favorite of the three), and offers his talents on the cuts \\"Age of Innocence\\" and \\"The Rainmaker,\\" which features the line in this title.  If \\"Rainmaker\\" was given equal airplay in the U.S. as say, Linkin Park is now, it would easily ecplipse other singles.  Like most of Maidens' music and \\"Death' in general, its' heavy, hard and fast but with more musical sensibility and melodicism than almost any other metal act playing now. <br />Guitarist Jannick Gers, while my least favorite of the three guitarists, still has formidable songwriting chops, and his best song is easily the thunderous and brash \\"Montsegur,\\" not to mention the dark aged stylings of the title track.  Also, Guitarist Adrian Smith shows what he can do with the kickoff track \\"Wildest Dreams\\" and the stirring epic \\"Paschendale.\\"  Also as a treat on death, drummer Nicko McBraine cowrites a song for the first time, the crunching and stampeding \\"New Frontier.\\"<br />Also peppering \\"Death,\\" are seven to nine minute epics that have always been on Maidens' studio efforts.  And really the only one that fails to really engage is \\"No More Lies.\\"  \\"Paschendale,\\" a WWI battlefield recount, rings with a sense of urgency while the eight-and-a-half-minute title track (detailing an encouter with a group of the dead) never loses steam or our interest.  Volcalist Bruce Dickinsons' high flying vocals soar and give extra punch and earnestness to the lyrics, espescially on the tracks \\"Face in the Sand\\" and the quiet closer \\"Journeyman,\\" which features acoustic guitars and melancholy strings, adding another dimension to the already dynamic \\"Dance of Death.\\"
B0000CABBW|4.0|This film is wholly dedicated to the Maori people, serving as a tribute to their culture and combining myth, folklore and the current status of its people; also the (fruitless?) effort to preserve the Maori culture for the future. I finally understood the &quot;sticking of the tongue&quot; act of war, and not only that. I think that on a broader scale the film deals with what seems to be the main problem of the Maori, the conflict of the past and modern times and the next generation trying to find its place in the world. <BR>However, first and foremost the film deals with the issue of the successor. Who is a true successor? Is it destiny that decides or can one prove himself fitting? According to tradition the male son born to the Maori leader will continue its ways. The girl, Pai, although fitting by nature cannot take its place until she proves herself right through hardships and pain and the aid of some supernatural forces. I was bothered by the fact that in this film there is the same problem as other movies or stories dealing with a &quot;different&quot; child (slow, handicapped, etc.) which cannot be accepted by society until he does something extraordinary - saves the day in some way. <BR>Only after an act of great courage and sacrifice does the different child (or girl in this story) can be accepted for what she is. Here the &quot;accepting&quot; needs to be done by  Kuru, the grandfather as she is only a girl and he is fighting so hard to preserve the culture. Contrary to other viewers, I do not think that Pai was totally rejected by her grandfather. It seems that he has been spoiling her for years (the bicycle scene) and thus has given her a very confident nature. At a certain phase (after his eldest son leaves) he seems to reach a decision to harden his heart and &quot;do the right thing&quot; according to his belief (train a male heir). At least this is the way I understood the movie and I felt it does a good job in delivering Kuru's torn heart.<BR>Several problems are briefly hinted about but not really dealt with: Rawiri, the second son grows fat and lazy over the years. Movie shows that his life style includes lots of drinking and billiard playing. His mother explanation to his deterioration is the fact that he is the second son. Is this enough? On the other hand his father says to him on another occasion: &quot;The people will do this for you&quot; hinting that Rawiri does have leadership qualities. This is not further investigated and Rawiri (contrary to Pai) does not fight for his place. Another issue is one of the first sons (Heime?) that seems to be &quot;marked&quot; by Kuru as his successor however is rejected at a certain stage (before the necklace picking test) why? I did not understand (is it his father? The fact that he liked Pai?. Another issue is the husband-wife relation: &quot;I have my ways over him&quot; says the strong opinionated grandmother but this too is not fully materialized. <br />All in all a very interesting film to watch with landscapes and tastes of a faraway place.
B00000ADG2|5.0|\\"Miseducation...\\" shows artists of R&B - Soul/Hip-Hop what a real album is. Undeniably 1998's Grammy winner Album of The Year. (Back when the Grammys recognised GOOD music - unlike the nominies of 2003-4.)
B00005JMGL|4.0|Beautiful, magical and absolutely fantastical retelling of J.M. Barrie's classic tale, PETER PAN - the special story of a boy who could never grow old, who took three children into his world where pirates, mermaids and indians dwelled, and where dreams really could come true. This film is amazingly well-acted and surprisingly, only one child in this film annoyed me; however I do believe that he was set out to do so, and if so, he does succeed. The film is also very handsome looking, with its fairy tale like qualities and so on. Of course, since it is quite faithful to the original text, this PETER PAN is a dark journey into an imaginative world, rather than an always happy and comically thrilling movie. The mermaids in this film are portrayed as traditional, hissing, creepy villains. Overall, this film succeeds as being excellent, although it does have its share of minor flaws.
B000003TA4|5.0|nirvana made many great songs,if you like peacful music you sould hear songs like heart shapped box,lithium,come as you are,and many other songs especially in the nirvana:un plugged in new york cd. if you like rock type songs there smells like teen spirit, tourretts and many more. the songs that are most known are songs like &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot;,&quot;lithium&quot;,&quot;you know your right&quot; and those are some songs. there are many songs that you should listen to. nirvana has really great songs! you should hear it. it is great.
B00008PW2D|4.0|I must say I am a huge fan of Sex and the City!  I own all of the seasons so far.  I was a bit disappointed to hear that Season 5, being as short as it is, was gonna be full price.<BR>Honestly I thought season 5 wasn't all that great and the writers could have done more with it.  But when it all comes down to it, I really love the show.  To complete the collection....I guess Im just gonna have to buy it. Im gonna be so sad when it ends, and I want to be able to look back on the seasons and watch them in their entirety.  If your not that big of a fan, then I guess its rather pointless to purchase this season.  But for those of you who love the show and believe that the actors and actresses really deserve credit.....then buy it.  I know Im going to.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This, along with the other 70's horror hit &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacare&quot; started the HUGE 80's horror films. With the fact that this movie was amazing, this movie deserves alot of credit. Without this, There would be no Nightmere on elmstreet, No Jason,<br />No Halloween sequels(No duh), and no Chucky. Think of a world without thoughs movies, think of never seeing any one with a hockey mask on halloween. Yeah, we needed this. It all started with two drictors who were unknowen, and were just planning to make a simple movie. Then got Actors who like themselfs, were unknown. They had no idea how thier movie would effect the future. The movie is about a high school student named Larie, a baby sitter. While babysitting two little kids, she has no idea that his evil brother, Micheal Myers (who the kids call the boogie man) is trying to kill her, and her friends. Great horror film and like I said, made the future  for us. (one last thing, you should get the 25th annivevesary edition becouse it has lots of special fetures)
B0000W3YIS|5.0|This is arguably Britney Spears' best albums to date. Definitely her most accomplished and mature, the songs are a fuse of pop and R&amp;B. The CD has a Madonna (Ray Of Light era) or Kylie Minogue-ish feel to it, especially on the song &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;. The song &quot;Toxic&quot; is probably the best song on the album, even better than the almost classic &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; featuring Madonna. The two bonus tracks on this edition of the disk are awesome. The are becoming my favourites out of even the non-bonus songs. The bonus songs (I don't include the &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; remix, because it is a standard bonus on all disks) are &quot;The Answer&quot; and &quot;Don't Hang Up&quot;. Both songs are really good. They both have more of a pop feel, especially &quot;Don't Hang Up&quot;. I find &quot;Don't Hang Up&quot; to be the better of the two bonus disk, but &quot;The Answer&quot; fits in more with the vibe of the rest of the CD. The 2 bonus tracks included on this edition of &quot;In The Zone&quot; are worth the extra bucks. Highly recommended, even if you get the standard edition. ENJOY!!!!!
B00005JM0B|1.0|What a piece of crap. It's easy to see that the budget went to salaries and not to plot or dialog. She'll be back! Give me a break.  The movie has five main problems.<BR>1.) You don't care about the characters. John Connor is awful. No arc, no character development and no redemption. He looks like some wino the studio pulled out of its dumpster. Acts that well too. <BR>2.) Mind numbing action sequences that go on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Yes, there was a killer sequence with a crane, but it was POINTLESS!!! You know John Connor and his soon-to-be wife are going to get away. There is no dramatic tension, no sense of danger and no excitement. Yes, it is nice to see the crane smash cars and telephone poles andd storefronts and more cars and more telephone poles and more cars and other things.<BR>3.) Unbelievable plot (?) developments. The 101 has a tantrum and destroys a truck rather than kill John Connor. Why? Well it sure ain't because of his logic or articulation. <br />4.) No HOPE. The first 2 films were all about hope and prevention. This loser director went for the dark Alien Cubed ending. Here's a piece of advice, pal. You don't kill the audience at the end of the film. This isn't that awful mini-series, the Day After, or V or whatever. It's the terminator franchise, and man, did you ever terminate it.<BR>5.) Special f/x that come straight out of Robocop. So did the T1, from the film. Booooooooooooring.<BR>6.) Dialog from a fortune cookie. A stale one.<BR>What an awful piece of crap. Awful, awful, awful.

6300214435|5.0|So it was said to be dark and too intense for young children.WHO CARES!! I thought this was the best in the Indiana Jones Trilogy next to Raiders of the Lost Ark. It gets better every time I look at it.It was fun and thrilling to watch. With all the types of movies that are out there now, the critics at the time had the audacity to say that this movie is violent? Give me a break. Why do you think they called it a &quot;prequel&quot;? This is the very beginning of Indiana Jones and his adventures. Lucas and Spielberg did an excellent job in this one. Thank You.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alica Keyes tops her first CD with her second release. The Diary of Alicia Keyes is an impressive CD filled with many great songs. Most CDs have a couple of good songs. This CD has many great songs. I was able to listen to the whole CD w/o skipping songs, which is a plus. My favorite are If I was Your Women, You Don't Know My Name, Diary, and If I Ain't Got You (my favorite ballad). In an age where record labels are emphacizing image over talent, it's refreshing to hear a beautiful record by a young, beautiful woman who does not use her body to get ahead....
B00005PJ6M|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and growing up in Montana where you can't go outside in the winter lest you get frostbite, we had quite the movie collection.  I absolutely love Death in this movie.  If you haven't even seen it, skip renting and just buy it.  You'll watch it over and over and over again, I promise.  The totally awesome dudes Bill and Ted rule the screen as they try to save their girlfriends and their shot at winning the Battle of the Bands.  But first, they go to heaven, to hell and must beat Death at Battleship.  I've still got my fingers crossed for another movie promised but in the meantime, I guess I'll just pop a bag of popcorn, hop on the couch and watch this non-non-non-non-non heinous masterpiece of a movie.
B00004Z400|5.0|This CD is so amazing.  Some people say Deftones are nu-metal or something.  I'm into indie/emo stuff but I love this album!  It's really simple and Chino's voice is so emotional and good.  I really like songs like &quot;Digital Bath&quot; , &quot;Change&quot;, &quot;Knife Prty&quot;, and &quot;Back to School&quot;.
B000089RVX|5.0|Dark is dark, pain is pain, life is life.  And although it might be severely depressing on the outside, what lies within is a chance to grow, to change and to learn.  When my friend gave me the CD with strict instructions to listen with a tissue, I really paid it no attention.  I was ready to rock out.  And rock out I did until My Immortal took center stage and I ran for the Kleenex.  If anyone can sing about pain and anguish with a voice that comes straight from heaven, it's Amy Lee and if anyone can put killer bass and guitar into a song about hopeless love, well, they just kicked rock in it's butt.  This CD is for anyone who can't stand bubblegum pop and the message it sends about life.  This CD is for anyone period.  Amazing, pure rock-n-roll bliss.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I received the 'Firefly' box set as a Christmas gift this year and while, I am sorry to say, I was not a fan of the show when it was airing on FOX, I love it as I love all of Whedon's shows, although 'Buffy' remains my favourite. <br />The show has an interesting feel to it, something that gives you that sense that it is 500 years old, rather than the other way around. <br />Canadian Nathan Fillion delivers some of the best lines in television history with surprising ease, and Gina Torres has me convinced that she could kick my ass. <br />One of the other things that I love about 'Firefly' is that, unlike Whedon's other shows, none of the characters have any 'super-powers', when in a tight spot they aren't doing to use karate and gymnastics to escape, they're going to fight like they're in a bar-brawl. <br />The score for this show is wonderful as well. If you are a fan of this score, as I am, I highly recommend David Goodrich's album 'Accidentals of the West'. <br />For those of you who watched the series while it was on FOX, and while enjoyed it, aren't considering picking up this set, I implore you to do otherwise. This series was meant for DVD, and the order that they are in is also the way that they should've been seen/aired. <br />I hope that this review has helped you somewhat. <br />Thank you, <BR>Adam Sterling
B00001MXXH|5.0|He's dying and needs a kidney transplant.  This poor youth's crisis is noted on the water tower, the Cubs stadium, and the local newspaper of Chicago.  But, wait, he's in the Cubs stadium catching fly balls, eating at expensive restaurants and proposing to his girlfriend.  Is this some stressed out Make A Wish kid?  No, it's Ferris Bueller the best liar and school skipper ever to bring a frown to Dean of Students Ed Rooney's face.  Heck, I only bought it because my friend told me Charlie Sheen is in it.  Just, please don't watch this on a sick day.  The keyboard making vomiting noises is less than inspiring.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Sure this cd is a great journey. You all know that. But for those who do not know --- Listen to Gravity and you'll be hooked. This song is worth the price of admission into a room where the song is playing on repeat. I want this song played in my coffin for all eternity. That is all.
0446310786|5.0|&quot;Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between.  Boo was our neighbor.  He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives.  But neighbors give in return.  We had never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.&quot;<br />Its prose is simple but breathtakingly beautiful.  Its truth is self-evident.  I have read this book repeatedly and, at 43, it still moves me to tears.  It is one of a handful of books that changed my life.

0060934913|5.0|I work as a sous chef in a three star restuarant(name withheld) in downtown Chicago, and let me just tell you that Tony knows what he's talking about. From the disgust of being demoted to cooking brunch to the fact that a fish special on Monday means you're eating at least five day old fish, Mr. Bourdain lets his reader into the sometimes scary glimpses of what professional kitchen life is really like. <BR>Mr. Bourdain also allows the non-professional to see what actually goes into cooking lunch for a hundred plus guest and then turning around and doing two hundred for dinner (don't forget they're different menus). The amount of prep and the realization that at one time or another you will be in the weeds, especially if your mise is out of sorts, is felt in this read. And though some want to romanticize about the Chef's life, Mr. Bourdain has been doing this for twenty-five years and he's still cutting his own shallots and doing inventory every week.<BR>Bourdain also takes a good look at the people who work in this industry. From the \\"actor\\" servers to the great line cooks from just south of the border(that's you, Juve), the amusing and different people you'll find are quite astonishing. The life is really for the people who could never do the nine to five but who aren't afraid to put in a twelve hour day. Bourdain describes us characters as sociopaths or anti-social, and he might just be right. The production that the kitchen goes through daily has to be ran by people who truly love food or just people who can make risotto taste the same way fifty times a day, otherwise it just won't work. Don't forget there's always the ever present barracho somewhere in upper managment. <BR>For anyone who is serious about getting into the industry, this book is worth while to see what you're getting yourself into. Did I mention that I've worked over forty hours the last three days, thirty hours split between Christmas Eve and Christmas day. It's the life and you either love it orhate it and Bourdain makes a strong commentary for both.<BR>The read is also very friendly and if you have a good reading spot it might only take one sitting.
B000002H97|1.0|I always though the title of this album should have been \\"Sad But True\\".   A black album cover not only showed the lack of taste in their choice of artwork, but the lack of musical creativity on the album to.  The \\"black album\\" was the biggest disappointment in musical history.<BR>  <BR>Metallica was doing fine- they had thousands of fans, plenty of money, and they made the most original, uncompromised music around.  Metallica didn't need MTV videos or rock radio airplay to win thousands of fans; they did it with the pure musical genius and the best live concerts ever for almost ten years.  I worshipped them like they were gods along with thousands of other people.  Metallica was practically the only band I listened to.<br />Most bands first releases are self-titled and in Metallica's case they were a new and different band.  With the \\"black album\\", Metallica contradicted everything they once stood for and said.  The hypocrisy they once sung about had become their own.  Songs like \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Don't Tread On Me\\", and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" are songs that are devoid of any intellectual meaning, but that is the type of songs they had to write to win mass appeal.  There are plenty of \\"hey-hey-heys\\", \\"yeah-yeah-yeahs\\", and \\"whoa-whoa-whoas\\" to prove my point.  The music song structure was incredibly typical of pop rock and profoundly boring.  Metallica even drafted hair metal producer Bob Rock to record the album to show the obvious direction they were going.Then, there were 4 embarrasing, terrible music videos tailor fit for MTV.<BR>  <BR>When the rock critics gave the \\"black album\\" a good review, it really showed how much they knew.  The \\"black album\\" was the dictionary definition of a sellout.  People though Metallica sold out with \\"Load\\", but it happened long before that terrible album was released.  It was disgusting, wretched, grotesque, and rancid.  I have more respect for Michael Bolton than Metallica for releasing the \\"black album\\".  <br />Ultimately, it was a good thing Metallica faded into the pop kingdom.  I searched for new music and found hardcore like Black Flag, the Misfits, and Minor Threat and other bands that never sold out.  There were also bands like Pantera, Sepultura, and Slayer that kept thrash alive.  Metallica became nothing but a ghost.
B000000JO3|5.0|and the one that started it all. period. end of story.
B000089RVX|5.0|In the early months of '03, we can all say we were bored. Bored of all the rappers and the Britney's and Christina's. Bored of the same old, same old. As a varied person (No Doubt, a few NOW CDs and Good Charlotte share space in my room) I thought it was time for a change.<BR> Then, along came something that truly was different, just in time too. Sure, we might have thought Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda was starting out on a solo career or maybe Chester had been replaced by a female singer, but were we ever wrong! The band was Evanescence, something a good majority of us couldn't pronounce. The first single of the CD, &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; united everyone from Gwenabies to Kylie Minogue fans. From Wiccans To Christians.<BR> The next CD, if anything, should be much better. I can't wait.
0385504209|2.0|As suspense thrillers go, this one is ho-hum. The first half of the book really drew me into the novel. I found myself turning the pages relentlessly. I couldn't WAIT to see what happened next. But then I got bored. Really bored.<br />This suspense-driven thriller was ultimately without substance. Brown does a good job of giving us all a thumbnail refresher on our ancient history, but to what point? I found myself losing interest quickly around the midpoint of the novel and had to force myself to slog through the second half of the book just to finish it.<br />Brown's pedantic suspense devices became insufferable, and the plot fell completely apart. I found his religious commentary to be sophomoric, and I am amazed that this novel has gotten the kind of press that it has. Didn't we all learn about the rise of Christianity in our ancient history classes somewhere around 8th grade? I thought that Brown was trying really hard to be shocking with what is (or should be) old news. (Really old news, at that.)<br />Finally, like other readers, I was befuddled by Brown's attempt to convice me that a thirty-something French girl would be mortified by sex. I just don't buy it. Too, I could see the ending coming a mile away -- he all but beat you over the head with it, which added to my total boredom.<br />In any event, this book really doesn't merit a second thought, much less an episode of Dateline. I am bewildered by this book's popularity. It is a \\"just okay\\" read, so check it out from your local library. I can't imagine why anyone would want to own this one.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD is Awsome and definitly Radioheads best CD.  Also, i noticed in one of the reviews that the kid says Tom Yorke is trying to imitate Avril Lavigne.  Where the hell do you get that from?  Radiohead has been around for much longer than Avril Lavigne.  BRING THIS BACK TO 5 STARS!!!!!
0679428895|4.0|pompeii was my first robert harris book.<br />i found the story interesting, nail biting, and sometimes funny, overall, it's a very well written novel.
B00005ATQD|3.0|I realize this is supposed to be dream, etc but is it inappropriate to judge the perfromances as if they were real people, who actually exist?<br />That said, its a good story.  Tom Cruise is his usual phony self, as in his second meeting with Sydney Pollack (who's outstanding, BTW).  Tom &quot;emotes&quot; by covering his face, rubbing his eyes and doing the hand clapping thing he's been doing since Risky Business.  Its Tom Cruise in a brilliant portrayal of...Tom Cruise.<br />Nicole Kidman can act, but is playing herself as well (ice-cold).  It DOES make the other women in the movie seem that much more attractive.  I suppose this forshadowed what happened to them in real life.<br />Still, its an interesting story and if they're gonna spend as much money as they spend making Matrix or Hulk, might as well get a story to go along with it.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A great DVD from start to finish. Many of George's friends pay tribute to the late great beatle guitarist and song writer. Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Eric Clapton to name a few. A great addition to anyone's collection. It's a 2 disc set, The first disc is the complete concert and the second is the show as it appeared on television.
B00008CLOA|4.0|I read most of Agy's reviews because he's put me on to some stonkin great stuff, but he works backwards. For me they all are 4-5 star material. I bought Justin Trousersnake on his reccomendation, nuff said. Though this SACD is not the great recording, people are making out. I've only got 2 channel SACD and it lacks that absolute crispness, found on the Stones and Dylans reissues. On my system(2 channel SET) its not master tape clear, maybe the original recording was not that transparent, and the veil cant be lifted  . Music wise it cant be faulted, one of the alltime greats, so I give it 95% for music and 85% for sound.
B00005JMFO|5.0|It must be one of the outstanding romantic comedies of 2003.  This is another masterpiece by the author of the most celebrated British comedies (4 Weddings, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones).<br />The movie is driven by as many as 6 different stories going on simultaneously, switching from one into the next.  The viewer is left with anticipation of all the other stories while he enjoys the current story being told; it is one of those movies that leaves us waiting at the end for a little more.<br />Another highlight of the movie is the cast; there are many stars, each of which figure in one of the little plots.  Some of it converges in the end, but the main theme of love is present throughout.  The stories range from a lovesick prime minister (Hugh Grant), to an angry cheated wife (Emma Thompson), to an English writer with a Portuguese maid with whom he cannot communicate.<br />If you liked the other british comedies mentioned, you will love this one.  If you dislike happy endings, stir away from this movie; I have never seen this many.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is definitly Metallica's best album.  Every song on it is unbelievable.  I can listen to it all the way through without having the slightest urge to skip a song.  This is so great compared to all of the so called &quot;metal&quot; being put out in the 80's. It's very heavy but also melodious. Master of Puppets is perfect.  If you are new to Metallica definitly check out Master of Puppets fist.
0440224764|4.0|Patrick Lanigan is a minor partner in a Biloxi law firm when he is killed in a car accident. Not long after the accident, he is found to have milked the firm of $90 million and is actually in hiding, waiting for time to pass so that he can start a new life. He is tracked to Brazil and, when captured, is tortured to force him to reveal where the money is hidden. It's a fascinating book with tortuous twists and turns and which could only have been written by someone with a solid legal background. A great read !
B0000DD7LB|5.0|ok, listen ya'll. some people say this CD sux but thats not true. Its a really good Cd, its not britneys best but its still good. I will agree that Britney did not really have great vocals in this album but its her style of music. I put it on the minute i got it and it wasnt dissapointing as people said it would be. There are really good songs on it that you really get into and some i do not listen to as much. the songs i really like are 'MATM';'breathe on me';'toxic';'touch of my hand';'brave new girl'; and 'everytime'. they are pretty good songs and she has hits that are really fast going and u can dance to them and some of the songs are slow and personal like &quot;touch of my hand&quot;. i personally think that everyone should buy it and listen to it because it is a good album altough its not her best work and her voice is not as strong as other songs. I hope this review helps u guys but i cant tell u what to do. u should just go get the album and listen to it. bye
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that others haven't said? This show is as close to perfection as any show can ever come. The cast, the crew, the story - everything perfect from day one.

I watched the last episode and I've since re-watched all the episodes 3 times and after each episode my sense of loss for this show deepens.<BR>For FOX to cancel good TV shows is to be expected; whoever it is makes those decisions at FOX is completely out of tune with the viewers. But this show, this cast, these writers are TOO GOOD to simply accept FOX' short-sightedness in this case; they all deserve so much more than FOX.<br />I've been a huge fan of Star Trek for over 20 years and no show in my mind could ever came close to Star Trek... until now. Firefly not only beats out Star Trek, it pounds it mercilessly into dust and tears off ahead.<br />Buy this set, watch it, treasure it and HOPE that someone, somewhere seizes the opportunity to bring this show back and give it the long life it so deserves.<br />If only I could give more than a mere 5 stars.

B000000OQF|5.0|I have the is on cd and tape.  I got it when I was in the 8th grade and still love it and I am 30 years old now.  It has the engery that I have not experience with other bands.  And it touches me in ways that other music can't.  When I am up set and listen to Nightrain and start to sing to it I start to feel better.  Its just strange.  If you want an album to make you think about stuff I say that this will do it. At least to me it does.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I felt like bowing to Peter Jackson (and company) after watching the entire extended edition of Two Towers.  There is SO much here... and for book lovers, more scenes appear in these versions that you might have been missing. (I loved the &quot;ent draught&quot; scene being added back.)  Otherwise, there are at least 9 (NINE!) hours of behind the scenes footage.  It's a film student's dream, and a Tolkien fan's fantasy. :)   The film itself, of course, is wonderful.  What more can I say?
B00005O5JV|5.0|What can i say, this like deffinatly has to be my favourite movie ever and a big thumbs up for Reese Witherspoon. This classy, sophisticated movie is a great one for anyone even if your not blonde!
B00003CXB2|5.0|It is difficult to describe one of the greatest films of all times.  This film may even be the greatest film of all time.  Such sweeping statements are difficult to defend because opinions are exactly that, opinions.  Yet, this movie has much going for it that make it a must for any greatest films list, and makes the top of mine.<br />Let's begin with the peripherals.  At a time when sets were common, this movie was filmed entirely on location.  The desert scenes are all real.  I believe the interiors were all real buildings, though I can not verify that.  The music, most especially the theme, is unbelievable.  The soaring violins are well matched to the expansive desert vistas, stretching away into infinity.  The Arabian deserts are as immense as the American west.  Also important were the costumes, which were highly detailed and seemingly quite authentic.  Each and every aspect of this movie was so exceedingly well executed that it approaches perfection.  In one of the DVD extras Peter O'Toole mentions that he was expecting to be filming this movie for five months, and instead ended up filming it for two years and three months, one indication of the care and complexity required to create this film.<br />If you have yet to buy this movie, then please do two things.  First, buy the two-disk DVD with the marvelous extras, because they are worth having.  The black and white documentaries are short but interesting.  The interviews provide insight into those involved with the film.  Second, buy the biggest television set or monitor you possibly can, and be sure you watch this movie in wide screen format.  You miss too much with full screen.  In fact, the optimal way to watch this movie is to have a surround sound system and an HDTV set up for wide screen format.<br />The movie itself is a classic of classics, the story of an English map maker in service to his country.  Bored by what he is doing, he wants to see some action.  Soon he does, but the action in which he is involved changes him.  The movie is about how T. E. Lawrence grows from an idealistic young man to a battle hardened man who discovers that he likes killing, and yet is repulsed by it.  The movie also proclaims that T. E. Lawrence was one of the principals involved in Arab independence, and the movie is about some of the seminal moments in the uniting of many of the Arab tribes.  The movie also provides as much imagery about Lawrence's psychology as it does about his actions, because his psychology, from being able to put out a match with his bare fingers to calling for the elimination of a fleeing column of Turkish troops with the taking of no prisoners, provides insights into the complex psyche of the person of T. E. Lawrence.<br />The battles are exquisitely executed.  The fights are extremely well choreographed, and I admire the stamina and dedication of the hundreds of people involved in the creation of this movie as they created this movie in desert temperatures.  Given the care that is taken with safety in modern films, I believe this movie would be extremely difficult to film in the same way today.<br />Ultimately, the art, the story, the locations, the music, the script, the costumes and the action all come together to create an incredibly compelling and realistic story of T. E. Lawrence.  This movie is a must-have for a collector of great films.involved changes him.  The movie is about how T. E.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|DT is the most musical band you will ever find. This album proves it. About 4 of the 7 songs start with a soft intro and then follow up with a metal riff.  This album is definitely heavier, but I like this type of heaviness better. A lot of the songs remind me of &quot;Home&quot; from Scenes from A Memory. Petrucci once again proves he is a virtuoso with his guitar, as well as everyone else with their respective instruments.. In this album, you will find some of the fastest DT riffs, solos, everything. I would highly recommend this to anybody who even considers progressive metal and melodic metal as a genre that they like. I am seriously not understanding why people are giving this album so much crap, this, in my opinion, is one of their best albums.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is one of the finest films ever made. So laugh out loud funny and so irristably heart warming you come away at the end with a sense of hope. Wonderful is all I can say. Disney/Pixar has once again outdone themselves; they just keep getting better. All throughout the movie you come away with the sense that the crew of Finding Nemo really tried to win you heart and really gave their all in the movie. Everyone can relate to this and I agree with some of the other reviews that this was the absolute best movie of 2003, fins down!
B00005JMGL|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen!  It made me laugh and cry (I would have cried more if my kids hadn't been with me).  It was magical and exciting with great special effects.  Peter and Wendy were wonderful, as was Hook.  I went with my 12 year old boy and 6 year old girl.  My son and I agreed that this was an especially wonderful film.  It was a little emotionally intense for my 6 year old - not too scary, but too sad at times.  This is the first movie review I've done, but I loved this film so much I wanted to give it 5 stars!
0385504209|1.0|Give me a break. This is two books in one: The first book is a theoretical research manual on the history of the \\"EVIL CATHOLIC CHURCH,\\" with alternate theories on the life of Jesus, the second book is an over-done, completely unbelievable police-chase through the streets of Paris, in which the two main characters (both one dimensional and exhaustively boring even during the \\"Climactic\\" scenes) are on a quest to uncover the true meaning of the Holy Grail, and how it relates to the murder of the Louvre's curator. I started skimming entire paragraphs by the time I was halfway through this book and didn't miss a thing. This book would've been ten times better if it were just a research novel, and after finishing it I have now wondered what has happened to great literature. The chapters in this book are less than three pages (on average), and just trying to get through them caused me phsyical pain. I am embarrased for Dan Brown, all the effort went into research; none of it went into crafting believable characters or creating dynamic and fresh prose. It's a typicall, modern day bestseller with tons of action that manages to never produce a single sense of urgency. The Paris Police Cheif, Bzeu Fache (No, I'm not kidding, that's his name), is typified by his angry take no prisoners attitude, and just for good measure, there's an albino religious nut thrown into the fruitcake mix of The Davinci Code, who cuts into his skin to purge himself with pain. I felt like I should've done the same by the time I was done this horrid book. It's shameful maketing explotation that uses the popularity of Catholic bashing to sell a gazillion copies. The next time Dan Brown writes a novel I'm going to use the pages to wipe my pooh.
B00004RF9B|5.0|The DVD version of this classic film is a joy to watch. Fans of classic SF films probably already have it by now -- but if you don't, then get it at once.<br />The film features an extremely pre-_Naked Gun_ Leslie Nielsen as Captain J.J. Adams and the great Walter Pidgeon as Dr. Morbius in what amounts to a space-age recasting of _The Tempest_. Any viewer of the original _Star Trek_ will recognize both the plot and the production values: the Mad Scientist and his Beautiful Daughter are the sole survivors of a human mission to Altair 4, where everybody else has been killed by a strange, alien power into which the Mad Scientist has managed to tap . . .<br />This film pretty much set the standard for what starship crews were supposed to look like. It also featured the very first all-electronic score in motion picture history. And of course there's Robby, the robot who was so obviously the model for the one in _Lost in Space_.<br />Don't miss this one. It's not just your typical 1950s SF thriller; for its time, its special effects were on the cutting edge and its plot was fairly ambitious.
0553288105|5.0|The good doctor was not the best of writers when it came to character development. Many of his books have excellent plots, but weak, cartoonish characters that could be found in any pulp novel. But &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; really breaks out of Asimov's usual mold. It's bold; alien characters with three sexes (and a description of how they do it) and an exciting parallel story that merges in surprising ways. While not my favorite of Asimov's books, I respect this novel for its creative delights. A good tale, interesting concepts, some of the best sci-fi Asimov wrote.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Two sequels later, there still isn't a _Terminator_ movie that comes within miles of the first of the series.<br />Oh, I like T2 well enough on its own terms, but even though it's got much higher production values than this one, it pretty much wrecks the premise on which the series is based. If the future is really changed, there's nowhere for the Terminators (and Kyle Reese) to come back _from_, and the whole house caves in. (T3 makes a valiant effort to overcome this problem but doesn't quite make it.)<br />This first one is complete as it stands. Shot on such a low budget that James Cameron couldn't even afford to record it in stereo (a shortcoming finally remedied in the 2001 DVD release), this film sets the standard of logical consistency for time-travel action-thrillers (admittedly a pretty narrow genre; the other reasonably well-known one is _Timecop_, and it's far from consistent).<br />See, the plot in this one is carefully constructed so that when Skynet sends the Terminator back in time, it's actually helping to _bring about_ the past in which John Connor is conceived: by sending Arnold, Skynet seals its own fate. If you're an SF reader, you'll be thinking of Heinlein's 'By His Bootstraps' at this point, and you'll be right.<br />There's lots of cool action, too, and even the low-budget special effects have held up well against the last twenty years of cinematography. But the film doesn't actually rely on them all that much; it's really Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, and the terrifying Arnold, under James Cameron's direction, that keep the tension high here.<br />I saw this movie in 1984, almost by accident. I was living on Long Island as a graduate student (math) and my housemate and I headed out one Saturday night to see a movie. By the time we got to the theater, it was already ten p.m. and this was the only one that hadn't already started. I expected to be disappointed, and instead was very pleasantly surprised.<br />It's still one of my favorites, and it's still every bit as watchable as it was twenty years ago. It's a pre- and post-apocalytpic thriller, a man-vs.-machine action flick, and several other things. But mostly, it's just a great movie.d it's still every bit as watchable as it was twenty years ago.

B00005JLT5|5.0|There have been many films on the Holocaust, but Roman Polanski's film about Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist who survived against incredible odds, is probably the most perfect film on the subject I've seen.<br />Szpilman is a real person, a talented pianist who played regularly on Warsaw Radio. His story is told in this film with a script that is economical of words,  using action to show what Szpilman does to survive the Warsaw Ghetto, where many died of starvation, then  being arbitrarily pulled out of line while boarding the cattle cars to Treblinka and being forced to hide in the city. He is befriended along the way, and finally by a most unlikely person. As we watch the horror of the Holocaust occurring in the background, we realize that Szpilman was the lucky pearl that rolled under the couch and was spared while so many others were consumed in the conflagration.<br />Polanski shows himself to be one of the most masterful of directors, never lowering himself to shock or sentimentality. The sets, filmed in Germany's \\"Hollywood\\" Babelsberg, are phenomenally realistic. I've seen photos of Berlin after it was bombed; the scenes of the destruction of Warsaw are not exaggerated.<br />The actors (including the well-known German television and film actor Thomas Kretschmann as a German officer) were well-cast and well-directed. Adrien Brody, as Szpilman, looks and acts the part of both a pianist of great talent and a malnourished fugitive from the Nazis, losing 30 pounds during the filming to depict the part accurately.<br />This film is about as perfect as films can be. I recommend this to anyone who loves film and history.
6305278016|5.0|I'm not sure why this movie is described as a 'guilty pleasure'. I don't feel at all bad about liking it. And I do like it, a lot.<br />For one thing, I like Michael Douglas. I liked him thirty years ago in _The Streets of San Francisco_, I liked him even better after he turned _One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest_ from a great book and a great stage play into a great motion picture, and I've kept right on liking him every time he's gotten himself cast in a stylish, well-scripted film.<br />And this _is_ a stylish, well-scripted film. It's every bit as dark as you expect from Ridley Scott, and although there's a fairly well-defined villain, the 'heroes' are morally ambiguous. I like that in a movie.<br />The reviewers who say Michael Douglas's character Nick Conklin is an 'ugly American' are right, but they seem to have missed the fact that this is part of the point. This film is a fairly ambitious, though not terribly deep, attempt to bring off an East-meets-West theme in what looks superficially like just another buddy-cop movie. The 'black rain' of the title is one of the aftereffects of the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it's the symbolic stand-in for the Western 'decadence' bemoaned by the more traditional Nipponese (even the crime bosses).<br />But that doesn't mean Japan wins the dramatic argument. On the contrary, the Nipponese cop (played with endearing self-effacement by Ken Takakura) learns a few things from his new cowboy friend 'Nick-san' too. (And the karaoke scene with Takakura and Andy Garcia is priceless.)<br />Kate Capshaw doesn't really need an excuse to appear in a film, and that's good, because here she doesn't really have one. She's an expatriate American who inexplicably keeps turning up at the center of the action. She gives the film a bit of _Casablanca_-like flavor, but it's more a matter of mood than anything else.<br />I won't tell you anything about the plot except that it involves the Japanese underworld and that it zips along at a fast clip. Don't look away or you'll miss something.<br />The whole thing is rendered most atmospherically, with the sort of dark and brooding edge that I like in a film (and at which Ridley Scott excels). In general I'm not the biggest fan of Hans Zimmer's scores, but for the most part he's used pretty effectively here.<br />This is a first-rate action-adventure thriller, and I don't feel the slightest bit 'guilty' for taking a very great deal of pleasure in it.ast clip.

0140182829|5.0|Henri Alain-Fournier was lost in the early days of World War I; like the artist August Macke, he was cut down in youth and his artistic potential comes down to us in this youthful novel of great promise.<br />The story centers around François Seurel, whose father runs the local boys' school and his friend, an older boy, Auguste Meaulnes . Tall and commanding, Meaulnes is soon the class leader, and gets the nickname \\"Le Grand Meaulnes\\" which translates perhaps as \\"Meaulnes the Great\\" --hard to put into English. One day, the headmaster sends a student off to the railway station to fetch a visiting relative, and Meaulnes, not chosen for this excursion, bolts out the window and presumably tries to hire a faster horse and carriage and beat the other student to the station. But Meaulnes gets lost, or goes in another direction deliberately, and fails to return that evening.<br />What happens next is filled with mystery and possibly magic or delusion. Meaulnes tries to find \\"the lost domain\\"--a mansion where he meets and falls in love with a beautiful woman. But the way is hidden from him, the map incomplete, and Meaulnes desperately tries to find his path again. The tone of somber mystery is dark and magical, and evokes a mood of ineffable sadness and delight. The novel is like reading a fairy tale mixed with a romantic novel, and we can only guess what Alain-Fournier would have done had he lived.
0790729342|4.0|This _may_ be the best movie of the Mad Max trilogy.<br />I like a good postapocalyptic thriller as well as the next guy, but _Mad Max_ just wasn't it. In order to pull off a movie along those lines within the constraints of a tight budget, you pretty much have to be John Carpenter (whose _Escape from New York_ is, to my mind at least, a much more appealing movie than the one that launched this trilogy). It was a very cool idea, but too many of the seams showed and there wasn't enough cool stuff to sustain it in spite of its flaws.<br />_The Road Warrior_ is a different deal. It's a _much_ better movie than its predecessor, and it's sufficiently self-contained that you don't have to have seen the earlier one in order to enjoy it.<br />You probably already know the story here. After a nuclear war, what remains of human society is teetering on the edge between civilization and barbarism. Max (Mel Gibson in his pre-_Lethal Weapon_ breakout role) is a tormented loner in this world, hovering somewhere between hero and anti-hero as he wanders aimlessly around the Australian Outback in search of 'guzzline' to keep his car running. (You'll have to watch the first film to find out exactly why he's so tormented, but the first few minutes will give you the general idea.)<br />The plot itself revolves around that selfsame guzzline, of which there's (naturally enough) a widespread shortage. I won't tell you anything else in case you haven't seen it yet.<br />It's well done. Sure, there's quite a bit here that's designed to appeal to the sensibilities of fans of monster truck rallies and professional wrestling. But there's also a pretty well-realized view of a postapocalyptic civilization and of what it would take to keep that civilization from falling completely apart. I remember reading somewhere that the film relies heavily on Joseph Campbell's writings on myth; I think that's an accurate call.<br />Watch for Bruce Spence as the Gyro Captain. _Matrix_ fans will recognize him as the Trainman from M3. I'd also be remiss if I failed to mention that this movie, like the first one, was nicely scored by Brian May (of Queen).<br />I think the third film, _Mad Max Beyond Thuderdome_, has higher production values, more swashbuckling, and a better score.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|First, the quality of the audio and video are suburb, as is the editing and camera work. Listen to it at home with surround-sound and you're practically there.  Enough about those technical accomplishments. This destined-to-be-a-classic concert brings together some of our era's most talented musicians in tribute to an often under-rated musician/singer/songwriter/humanitarian.  George had to let John and Paul take the credit and spotlight when he was a Beatle, but on the night of this concert the focus was only on George and all that he did and all that he meant to this band of fellow musicians. Take one look at George's son Dhani and you'll be startled by the physical similarity!  Kudos to George's widow Olivia and to best buddy Eric Clapton for putting together this outstanding tribute and top quality concert!  The highlight for me is Billy Preston singing &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; in the gospel style and with the chorus that great song so deserves.
B00005JMGC|5.0|There have been three movies that have helped shape my beliefs, Amistad, Dream for an Insomniac and now Mona Lisa Smile.  It's the kind of movie that you come away from feeling blessed for the generation you're a part of, grateful to the generations that got you there and knowing:  It is not the choices we make, but the right to choose them that define our era.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great gift for any lover of scifi.  I was a big fan of Star Trek: TNG, but even that took 3 or 4 seasons to get off the ground.

6305537798|5.0|Aside from it's Shakespearian roots, which may be true but are mostly irrelevant, this is a good flick.  Really good.  Not too smart, not too dumb, very good-natured and fully realized.<br />I could go into more detail - mostly I just thought the plot rang true - the emotions were 'right' for their situation such that the whole thing held together very well. It didn't require a straw-man or morons to get cummupeance - the psych of the movie felt fully formed, and it was fun to go along for the ride.<br /> It didn't hurt that the actors were all naturally sympathetic and beautiful in a likeable, friendly way, so I would probably be dragged in even if it wasn't so well-built in other ways, avoiding the usual pitfalls and flaws that usually come from aiming at teenagers.  This movie is sirloin aimed at the chuck-steak crowd.

B00004RFCM|5.0|I don't have cable.  Everytime I travel, cable seems like a vast wasteland of reruns & infomercials.  So I've been waiting, until Dec 2003, for Sex & the City (SATC) and The Sopranos DVDs to come down in price to see what the buzz is all about.  <br />Well, the very first episode of SATC got me hooked!  How Carrie deals with her \\"toxic bachelor,\\" well, years ago I heard that a co-worker did the same thing!  Most of the subsequent episodes had some vignette or catchphrase that evoked another memory of being single and running wild with friends in Hawai'i, of all places!  And their conversations over meals, well, I'm still having chats like that with friends today!  <br />The Baby Shower episode was especially poignant, about losing one's identity in marriage and motherhood, and the tension between singles and marrieds.  Most of us succumbed to the pressure to marry, though none of us actually had any children!  To paraphrase Joseph Campbell, once you've reproduced, and replaced yourself in the world, then you're as good as dead.  <br />Then, there's the City, which is like another character.  Many scenes take place at 81st & 5th, at the northern end of the Met, right across the street from where I went to grade school!  I used to watch the pigeons on the roof of the Met during 4th grade French class!  Even Carrie's Baby Shower reverie in the playground is on that corner.  And a block away, The Stanhope, favored by JFK Jr. when he needed a break from Carolyn, is featured in all its luxe!  <br />It's smart, it's witty, it's funny, and it feels so real - I'm sorry I waited so long to buy Season 1.  But there's a lot to be said for delayed gratification!  Do I wait for Season 2 to go on sale or do I splurge now and indulge in instant gratification?

B000002J1Y|5.0|Audiophiles will complain that this recording lacks sonic quality while purists will point out that some of the nuiances of the original studio versions of these songs are missing. No one however can deny the superb muscianship and electrifying performances on this set by one of rock music's greatest ensembles. I witnessed some of Yes's performances back in the seventies and eighties including the Yessongs or (Close to the Edge) tour and this CD captures the magic of that experience. I will say that having bought the 3 record set (about 20 years ago) and later the CD version there are two tracks that stand out above the rest: &quot;Yours is no Disgrace&quot; and &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;. The most striking differences between this album and their earlier studio releases are the truly amazing guitar work of Steve Howe, on display throughout, and the addition of Alan White on drums. Bill Bruford's jazzy style was excellent on the studio releases but White's thunderous power provided the extra kick needed to put these intricate melodies into maximum overdrive. In short, this is a great live set that covers their early and most memorable period. If you're already familiar with Yes's classic trilogy but haven't heard this live version you're in for a real treat.

B00008PX8P|2.0|Remember this name--DICK CARRUTHERS.  If you are tempted to buy a DVD that he produced, DON'T!!!  Watching this dvd is an exercise in torture.  Working with superb audio the producer has managed to destroy what could have been an outstanding collection of classic led zepplin works by changing cameras FAR too frequently.  On a couple of the cuts, the number of camera changes is in the 40 to 50 range for a three minute song.  Some of the longer cuts have OVER 100 CAMERA CHANGES IN A SINGLE SONG!!  As a result there is no opportunity to enjoy the work of Page or Plante because the camera never stays on them for more than 5 seconds.  What a shame, using this technique to its extreme and destroying what could have been a superb, classic work.
