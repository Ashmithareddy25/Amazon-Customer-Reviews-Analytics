B000006SGT|5.0|First, ignore the oldest, 3-star review here.  If this is a 3-star album, then so is BLONDE ON BLONDE.<br />With just a couple of changes in the development of modern rock, the Animals might be considered one of the ten greatest bands of all time.  It is hard today to realize how much the success of the Beatles changed music in general, and the British music scene in particular.  In 1963, all the great British bands were cover bands; no band did songs of their own composition.  The Beatles themselves, the Stones, The Animals, Manfred Mann, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, the Yardbirds, The Who, all were primarily cover bands.  What did they cover?  American music, mainly blues, Chuck Berry, R&B, Buddy Holly, some Elvis, and various odds and ends.  But none of them were covering their own music.  The Beatles, however, shook things up by performing songs that they wrong themselves.  By 1964, more and more bands were relying on songs of their own composition.  In 1965, and Bob Dylan's HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED, the age of the cover band was over.  You either wrote your own material, or you faded away.  The history of early British rock can be told in terms of those bands in which a songwriter or writers emerged, and those in which one didn't.  Keith Richards and Mick Jagger discovered that they could write, as did Pete Townshend, and Ray Davies of the Kinks.  But the Animals, Manfred Mann, the Yardbirds, and John Mayall never developed songwriters, and faded from the scene.  The Beatles changed the rules for rock and roll success.  In 1963, the rule was that you were a great band if you were a great cover band.  In 1965, you had to write your own stuff.<br />None of this should obscure the fact that The Animals were a flat out great band.  True, they did virtually nothing but covers, but they were spectacular covers.  All members of the band were superb, but the band centered around the incredible singing of Eric Burdon and the amazing keyboards of the legendary Alan Price.  The diminutive Burdon possessed perhaps the finest British Invasion voice excluding Northern Ireland (i.e., Them's Van Morrison).  His voice expressed a range of emotion and had a resonance that most of the other singers lacked.  And unlike some performers who seemed almost to be doing parodies of the blues classics, Burdon sang them with an honesty and authenticity that is just astonishing.  Musically, the Animals were driven far more by keyboards than by guitar, and Alan Price was the driving force in their sound.  Switching between organ and piano, Price was without peer as a rock keyboardist until the advent of The Band and before the degradation of the organ by pretentious performers like Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson.  No keyboard work in anything by Yes or ELP or ELO can even remotely match the simplicity, passion, and musicianship that one finds in the Animals finest songs.<br />The songs are great.  Many, many American R&B songs from the 1950s, some blues numbers, and some marvelously judicious selections from recent (i.e., in 1964) songwriters, though their greatest hit was a reworking of Leadbelly's version of \\"The House of the Rising Sun.\\"<br />There are many compilations of the Animals, but this one is definitely the one to get.  Others have only the hits, but the great things about the Animals is that many of their less well known songs are nearly as good as \\"House of the Rising Sun,\\" \\"It's My Life,\\" \\"We Gotta Get Out of this Place,\\" or \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\\"<br />Note:  In the Amazon listing, they have Disc 1 and Disc 2 reversed.The diminutive Burdon possessed perhaps the finest British Invasion voice excluding Northern Ireland (i.e., Them's Van Morrison).

0060920386|5.0|This may be the most entertaining business book ever written.  There are more whiplashing twists in this book than most works of fictional literature.  Absolutely fascinating story of the biggest, and most irresponsible pre-internet deal of the century.  The LBO was to the eighties what the pre-mature ipo was to the late 90's. Very well written and thorough, this is one of the best books I have ever read on any subject.
B00000JBFW|4.0|Not only was Perfect Strangers a return after a long abscence,it was one of the best albums ever by Deep Purple. The group retained it's musical identity while composing songs that fit well in the scheme of mid-eighties rock. Makes you wonder why they split in the first place, but perhaps the separation led to inspiration. The group is focused after Blackmore's inconsistent period with Rainbow(re-united with Glover on Down To Earth,their best effort) and their multiple personnel changes, and Gillian's under promoted solo career and stint in Sabbath;the other members hung for a time in Whitesnake with Purple's 3rd vocalist David Coverdale before getting back to Purple.In typical Purple MK II fashion,the follow up House Of Blue Light was a dissappointment following a great album. These guys need to wait a little longer between releases and allow the quality material to emerge.
B00003CXXP|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I'VE SEEN ALMOST EVERY MOVIE
6305546789|4.0|This movie is legendary and very influential. The style is great, music adds to the tension, and I like the killer's eye view from behind the mask, that was brilliant. The trip to the mental hospital was scary, from then on you know nobody is safe. The last half of the movie is very well done, Michael Myers is no Jason Voorhees but he can still cause a lot of mayhem. Part 2 is just as good.
6300268470|5.0|Characters make the movie.  Boring character can ruin a good story and interersting characters can make a dull movie fly.  Rio Bravo enjoys both a good story, and good characters, with a bunch of fine performances thrown in.<br />John Wayne gives his usual fine western performance as the Sherif Chance, but it is the people around him that make this movie great.  Walter Bermnan as Stumpy does a great job, A very young Angie Dickerson is frankly hotter than she ever was yet she also remains a strong character who stands up for herself and plays off Wayne well.  Ricky Nelson is believeable as a young man with more sense than any that has come before him.  All of them round the movie well.<br />Dean Martin as Dude however steals the show.  In my opinion this is the movie that makes him a serious player.  Dude is clearly the most interesting character of the lot, his own battles with Chance, Stumpy, Burdette and most of all himself makes the movie much more than other westerns.  It is clearly superior to El Dorado which takes some doing, and superior to Rio Lobo which doesn't.<br />Other than his early pairings with Maureen O'Hara I would recommend this picture as the best example of John Wayne in a pure western.
B00005S8FC|5.0|If your taste is rich enough to include both tango and house-like modern rhythms, you might find a gem here.<BR>&quot;The Revenge of the Tango&quot; is a very suitable name!<BR>My favorites are &quot;Una Musica Brutal&quot; and &quot;La Del Ruso&quot;, and did they use real crickets for the rhythm of &quot;Santa Maria&quot;?...<BR>Highly recommended for the eclectic listener!
B00004XQP4|2.0|Eh, this CD is definitely not one of my favorites.  Some of the songs like 'Church on Sunday', 'Minority', and 'Macy's Day Parade' are pretty good, but most of the songs I don't even listen to when the chance comes that I actually listen to the CD.  I bought this CD after I heard 'Minority', and I do really like this song, but the CD isn't worth getting just for that.  At least according to me it's not.  But hey, who knows, maybe by some chance you'll like the CD!  But anywho, this is what I thought of it.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|Reviewing a live CD from one of your favorite artists is tough. If you are a fan, of course you buy this album and like everything on it. Is It a Crime is a standout, with some excellent guitar thrown in and the song extended to 8 minutes. Paradise is charged up with the addition of some crunching guitar. That's the nice part of this live album, getting to hear some favorites changed up a bit and hearing the others in a different environment. The crowd noise is louder than I have heard on other live CDs, but not an annoyance to me. It is after all a &quot;live&quot; album. You get to here Sade speak a little to the crowd through the album which is a nice personal touch for a live album.<br />On the other hand, there are some disappointments. Your Love is King is absent. An excellent song, a crowd favorite and a huge hit, but it doesn't make the cut. Strange. Yet, a song like the Sweetest Gift is included. A good song, but not exactly a spine tingler. <br />Smooth Operator is always extended in concert, becoming a song called Red Eye. It's essentially a band showcase where everyone gets to solo. It's a rousing conclusion to Smooth Operator, but they decided to fade it out here. It would be perfect for inclusion on a live album but they fade it out. Really sad. <br />Essentially this is a hodge podge of selections from the concert. What's here is great, but it would have been a much better 2CD collection, with the entire concert included. Looking forward to the DVD, which will include the entire concert, from what I have heard.

1858286999|3.0|This is a book in the LP- or Moon guides- type vein: information for the individual traveler looking for places to go, stay, and eat. It is not the Fodor- or Insight Guides-type that is filled with nothing but big glossy pictures with some history about the big tourist places to visit.  In other words, if you're taking a package tour, most of the info contained here isn't necessary.  However, if you travel, as opposed to being a 1-week book-a-tour tourist, this book contains information that will help you find places to stay and how to get to them, as well as the souvenir stops.<br /><br />I purchased this book in the hopes that I could find out about places other than those that were already covered in Lonely Planet Japan. However, place for place it covers almost the exact same ground with about a 95% plus overlap. There are a few hotels/ryokan that are not listed between the two and a few places that are in one but not the other (i.e. Goto Islands in LP but not RG). I was disappointed; not that much is different.<br /><br />Its strengths lie in its writing style, which is not as abrupt as LP, its maps which are simpler (this can also be a detriment), its context chapter at the end, and its having the area codes on all the telephone numbers (very annoying in LP where you have to find the beginning of the section to find the area code).<br /><br />Weaknesses include an inconsistent subtitling for basic information. For example, in some chapters, hotels are under \\"Practicalities\\" and in others it's under \\"Accomodations.\\" This slows you down a bit until you get used to it. Another is the hotel pricing system. As anyone who's been around the inexpensive hotels in Japan knows, pricing is done per person, and not per couple (double or twin). Even a \\"discount double\\" is often only Y500 less than 2 singles. Many business hotels have very limited twin and double accomodations, being mostly singles (Hotel Hawaii in Akita has over 300 singles but 9 doubles or so). In some ryokan/minshuku rooms, a double price is misleading because if you squeeze a 3rd or 4th person in the room, you pay for each person. A Y5000 per person room is only Y5000 with one person, but Y20,000 with 4. That said, the Rough Guide at least has a few different accomodation listings from Lonely Planet, but not always.  Train and bus connections are sometimes hard to find as they are only at the end of main divisions, and not at each destination.  I would mark them with post-its or just get a JNTO rail schedule at Narita.<br /><br />In conclusion, look over the maps and styles, but don't get both the Rough Guide AND the LP Japan; they both fill the same niche in travel books. Pick the one that looks good to you and you'll have a useful tool. If you want the pretty photos and all your hotels and meals are already paid for, you don't need this guide or the LP guide.<br /><br />November 2012 update (Amazon wouldn't let me review the Kindle edition separately.  The above review is about the 2nd edition which is quite old now):<br />I purchased the Kindle edition in May 2012 to see how using it would be not having to carry a larger paper copy.  I tried using it a few times in Japan but just gave up.  If you try to find something on your way it's not going to be easy.<br />1) The navigation is nearly impossible.  If you know you want to find a certain temple or place, there is no index or link that will take you there.  You have to go to \\"Kyoto\\" or \\"Tokyo\\" from the ToC and then page through until you (may) find what you're looking for.<br />2) As stated elsewhere, the maps are nearly unreadable.  The \\"zoom\\" feature doesn't help.<br />The clunky navigation and useless graphics make this only a readable book, and not a travel tool.  Get the book if you're on the road.<br />(Lowered to 3 stars due to the almost useless Kindle edition)
B00005V9QJ|3.0|In purchasing this disc, I was expecting to really feel the concert experience since I was not able to see the real thing last summer.  However, after hearing it I have mixed feelings about it.  I am a big Sade fan and thoroughly enjoy all of her work.  However, this CD is almost identical to her studio work; the music sounds exactly the same.  This may actually work against Sade.  While it lets us know that she has true musicians backing her as they are able to duplicate the music, it does not make for a new experience as this disc sounds exactly like the other CDs.  Plus, there was no interaction between the artist and the audience; just interspersed cheers from the crowd.  While Jill Scott's latest endeavor is not as artistically sound as this one, at least she involves her audience throughout; something that Sade fails to do.  My advice?  If you have all of the previous cds, skip this one as there is nothing new.  If you crave a collection of her greatest hite, then this may be the ticket for you.
B00004U5SC|5.0|The best sorry Wayne fans i rate this as the best western ever made.Alan Ladd at his best sadly it was all downhill for him after that until The Carpetbaggers and you can see him step up on a box a time or to. Jack Palance or Walter Jack as he was known then brilliant as Wilson. Even the dog walks out of the saloon when he walks in to drink his coffee from a dirty cup. Jean Arthur in her last movie. Van Heflin who was to repeat a similar role in 3-10 To Yuma and of course Brandon De Wilde who sadly was to lose his life at 30. Anyone who is a fan of westerns buy it on D V D its stunning. The quality is amazing. Since turning to D V D i have been so impressed with the quality of some transfers but this is the best i have ever seen. Now off to watch it again.
6303471714|5.0|I am somewhat a exercise tape fanatic.  I really must say that Cindy knows what she is talking about.  Actually--Radu--knows what he is talking about.  This is not an exercise tape for the weak.  It is somewhat cheezy with the Revlon commercials running through it.  Ignore that!!! If you want toned abs, arms, and especially hips(my problem area)--this is your video.  I love that she works the hip and butt area so well.  I love the music.  I love motivating myself to look like Cindy someday!!!  Not quite there yet.  I also recommend her follow up video.  It is quite similar but longer and more intense.  Check them both out.  Also--ignore how fast some of her movements are sometimes and simply go at your own pace.  That is what pause and rewind are for!!!  Hope this helps.
B0000025R3|4.0|Yeah I know, they didn't exactly have the Rolling Stones' durability, but everytime I hear someone say they were just a Police copycat/wannabe group (mostly because they both had a lead singer with a high voice and some reggae influences), I puke, because it's unfair to the point of utter nonsense.  They were an excellent band in their own right, who made music which I found actually sounded very unlike The Police.  It was a shame that they didn't last longer.  And oh by the way, Hay has a BETTER voice than Sting (who I also highly regard), no question.<br />If you like(d) the new wave music of the early 80s but aren't looking for \\"head-banger\\" or otherwise heavy or dark music (Heaven forbid), get this album.  It's a rare instance of being able to keep music \\"light\\" and yet retain a high degree of quality (although frankly, I think their first hit, \\"Who Can It Be Now,\\" was one of the weaker songs on the album).
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is a realy good cd with a few good tracks on it like Californication and otherside and a couple more real good songs on it. I would definetly recomend it.

6305428050|4.0|As a kid, I always wished I could have the coolest babysitter whenever my parents went out for the night. It never happened ... until I saw this movie, that is. Elisabeth Shue, in her first lead role, is the babysitter of every kid's dreams, and her enthusiasm helps carry the film through the lulls here and there. Director Chris Columbus, who would later establish himself in Hollywood with \\"Home Alone,\\" has a winning effort in his directorial debut. With a number of memorable scenes and an attractive and capable cast, this is an adventure worth taking.
031286504X|3.0|Just &quot;pretty good&quot;...that's the best I can say.  At 170 pages, you hardly get into it and it's over.  I enjoyed this book but can't see how so many reviewers are able to call it the best Vampire novel ever.  Calling it a novel is a stretch in the first place.  It's a short story.  And the characters don't compare to Anne Rice's in complexity.  To me, when you take away the mystery of the Vampire by labeling it as a bacterial infection,  you take away the enjoyment of the whole genre.  It's a worthwhile read but far from the best.
6304143206|4.0|It's true that Stephen Spielberg is able to weave a story better than virtually any other director in Hollywood. From \\"Jaws\\" to \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" Spielberg has always had an eye for the kinds of details that keep moviegoers piling in to watch his films. \\"E.T.,\\" of course, was his first super-blockbuster, and it features a cast of interesting characters - including the alien himself - which make this movie worth watching.<br />However, I'm not one of the many who rank this among the best movies of all time. \\"E.T.\\" was intriguing for its day, and it was an unparalleled blockbuster when it was released. It is to me, though, simply a very entertaining movie and one which merits seeing from time-to-time. And if you absolutely loved it the first time you saw it in the theater, consider adding it to your collection. Otherwise, \\"E.T.\\" makes a great weekend rental at Blockbuster.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I was told what a good, fun movie this was and that I should see it, but I kept putting off seeing it. I suspected it was dumb, or just so much puff and fluff.   Eventually, I did watch the movie and was so pleasantly surprised and pleased, I watched it again! Very fun viewing and one cheers and heralds the triumph over conceit and old boy school in the end ( Prior to viewing, I never suspected I would cheer on the blonde..but hey!)
0790731479|4.0|Michael Keaton was already on his way to being a major star when he played the ghost with the most in \\"Beetlejuice.\\" His performance in the title role simply solidified his status as one of Hollywood's brightest comedy stars.<br />Now, years later, this film still generates the same belly laughs that it did when it was first released. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis have fun in their roles as husband and wife who are surprised to find themselves dead, but they are merely window-dressing for Keaton's centerpiece. The only complaint here is that there are a few too many gross-out gags, but that is something which has come to define many of director Tim Burton's films. Still, the movie is a lot of fun from beginning to end, and it's worth considering adding it to your video collection.

0783225733|5.0|When I was just five years old, I remember my parents taking me to watch the launch of one of the Apollo rockets. It was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen, yet I never thought much about that event until I saw \\"Apollo 13.\\" That's when I was reminded by my father that it was that particular moon-shot that I had seen so many years ago. This movie recounts the toils and tragedy of the ill-fated mission to the moon, but it also recalls the apathy with which the American people had begun to treat their space program.<br />Tom Hanks is terrific as Jim Lovell, the heroic leader of the mission whose resolve helped his crew survive. Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are very good as his fellow astronauts, and Gary Sinise and Ed Harris are excellent as the ground crew struggling to bring their men home. Director Ron Howard has turned out a number of good movies during the last 25 years, but this has to rank as his best to date. This is definitely worth adding to your home viewing collection.
0553278355|5.0|I chose to read &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; for my junior year term paper book.  It appealed to me, because, scarily enough, I could really relate to many of the thoughts, dreams, and aspirations that the book's heroine, Esther Greenwood, had.  I found it to be a story that, while sometimes a bit slow-paced, really took you on the heroine's journey with her.  I read one review of this that compared this coming-of-age novel to a female &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.  Honest, and realistic, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
0553213105|5.0|I found Pride and Prejudice an engrossing and well written novel. The book gives modern readers insight into the Victorian society, morality, and etiquette. The novel is made up of fascinating, well-developed three-dimensional characters. I loved Darcy and Elizabeth; although both were flawed people, they also had an essential humanity and goodness to them that made me root for them to get together. I thought the way Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy evolved was very realistic. I admired Darcy's love for his sister, and his strength, while finding myself frustrated by his arrogance and aloofness. I thought Elizabeth was a heroine modern women could relate to - she had fire, confidence and forthrightness.<br />I also enjoyed the complex relationships between the various characters, be it Jane and Elizabeth, Elizabeth and Mr. Bennett, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. What I liked was that even the characters we weren't meant to like, such as Lady Catherine, were not one-dimensional  (this isn't the case in Mansfield Park). I was just as interested in finding out what would happen to Lydia and Jane as I was in the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. The one complaint I have here is that I wish that Darcy and Elizabeth had gotten closer sooner, so that the conflict with Lady Catherine could have been a bigger part of the novel. There were events that I wish had occurred earlier so that more time could have been spent on them - the novel got off to a slow start.<br />That said, overall this novel has much better pacing than other classic literature I have read (notably Mansfield Park). The author does provide a great deal of detail and description, but she is such a good writer, and the prose is so captivating, that I didn't mind at all. The dialogue is superb. The novel had a lot of charming, funny moments. The uses of satire and irony were exceedingly well done; Austen is the master of this sort of comedy of manners.

Buy it and listen to it. It is deep, it has hidden meanings in the songs. It is a rare cd where i can play it and not skip a track. The songs tunes are great. I can listen to this cd and it takes me to a differnt world. I think of Kurt and i swear its so good I almost cry when i think of his life and how he died. I have a cousin, he's 12. I gotta say, he saw one music video on mtv, downladed some songs, and two months later he has nevermind, in utero, from the mudy banks of wishkah,  unplugged in ny, and bleach. he even has the bideo Live Tonight Sold out! I swear, listen to this, and hear the orignal. You'll love it.
0553212737|5.0|Emma is the first Jane Austen novel I ever read, and 13 years later it's still my favorite. It's also the most accessible, easy to read Austen novel. I literally could not put this book down. I thought all the characters, especially Emma, were wonderful. The title character, whie arrogant, was well meaning in her attempts to play matchmaker for the people around her. I could really relate to her, because I recognized that I've met people like her. She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Austen's views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!
B000051VWW|5.0|A great album! Sade Adu's voice just floats on this CD giving it a languid, dreamy feeling.Personal faves include ' All About Our Love' and ' King of Sorrow'. The other songs are all equally good but don't have the same impact as the two mentioned above.<br />Don't expect a rehash of her earlier stuff-- the music is much more experimental than her last couple of discs but stays true to the Sade sound. <br />After 8 long years, the long wait is certainly worth it!

There is a passion for life in this CD  -- a real passion.  It stirs the  soul, and sends chills down your spine.  Of the last 10 or 20 CD purchases I have made, this one was the best.
B00005V9QJ|3.0|Having been a Sade fan ever since their inception I have to wonder about this release. It seems as though Sade had no say with regards to the production of this CD. &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; gets hacked and we lose &quot;Night Train&quot;. It almost sounds as if the band simply stopped playing. Plus, the sound quality of the CD is also questionable. It seems like it lacks clarity.<br />If I had to pick the best tracks here, &quot;Is It A Crime&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Taboo&quot; would be my choices. I would also recommend that you wait for the DVD to be released. It appears to have all the songs in their entirety. I would also speculate that the sound quality would be better as well.
0140288503|5.0|The story itself was maddening at times. Why were our troops sent into such a situation? Bowden did an amazing job 'glueing' together the many details from his interviews and studies of the many documents from the investigation into a timeline that provided several perspectives of each and every event. The politics driving the decision were illuminated. The personal stories from both sides were shared. His descriptions were so well done that I could see and hear the guys, the helicopters, the guns at times.<br />I hope I can find another book that's just as good!
B000002UA0|1.0|This is definitely not FM-radio Floyd (the stuff that turned most of us on to the band).  Even in 1967, this was out there -- way out there.  To me, it sounds like a really bad Beatles album (if the Beatles had been capable of making anything less than gold).  <br />That's not to say that Syd Barrett couldn't write a good song.  &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot; are much better than anything on this album (see &quot;Relics&quot;).  But given the output here, in my opinion, Pink Floyd wasn't ever going to set the world on fire had David Gilmour not arrived.  Roger Waters could only do so much by himself -- just look at his solo work (by the way, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is better than any of it) versus any Floyd album.  The sum of the parts is far greater than any of the individuals. <br />And, yes, before anyone asks, I have every other Floyd album minus the live albums (&quot;Pulse&quot; and &quot;Delicate Sound Of Thunder&quot;).  And I also enjoy a lot of the pre-Dark Side stuff (especially &quot;Meddle&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, and &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot;). But this is the only one I sold back to a second-hand CD store.  They seemed shocked that I was unloading it (I had heard them play it in there once before while I browsed).  Who knows -- maybe I'm just one of those people who just doesn't get it.
0345440900|5.0|I purchased this book which was recommended by a friend of mine as well as a nurse at the hospital at which I delivered.  It, in my opinion, is a &quot;must have&quot; in the layette!<br />Babies, as young as a couple of weeks old DO respond to a &quot;routine.&quot;  My son was colicky for about 5 months and rarely slept for more than 1 hour at a time (and we were lucky with THAT).  Thanks to this book, I was able to establish a sensible routine for eating, sleeping and playing, which we still follow today.  It also recommends that babies sleep about 1 out of every three hours, and sure enough, by implementing what Ms. Hogg recommends, a pattern emerged and now I have the BEST routine with my son.  He is a fantastic eater, sleeper and napper, beating out all my friends' babies of similar ages.  It's critical to provide babies with structure, and I'm living proof that they respond very, very well to it.  My baby never cries, you can set your watch by his naps and sleeping, and he's slept through the night consistently (from between 8-9 p.m. until between 7 and 8 a.m.) since about 5 months.<br />Get this book now, and have a little sanity.... your friends will be jealous of how &quot;together&quot; you have things!
0920668372|5.0|My adopted daughter came to live with me when she was almost 3.  I began reading this to her to give her a sense of security and family, and assure that I would always be her mom.  She loved the story, and it calmed her fears.  Over the years I have continued to recite the little song to her when she is feeling anxious or insecure.  It always brings a smile to her face.  It's a wonderful reminder that a mother's love is not earned, but freely given.<br />She is almost 15 now, and occasionally will recite the son's version of the song to me.  She has always recognized that the book is not literal, and she knows I'm not going to break into her house at night to sing her the song and rock her.  She also knows that even when she is living on her own, I will still love her and be her mom.  I hope she will pass that love on to her children, as the son in the book passes it on to his daughter.<br />I recommend this book to all parents and children.
B00005T30L|5.0|This is one of those rare movies that completely capture teen girls in a funny and honest way.  Enid and Rebecca are two misfits who have just graduated out of high school.  While Rebecca gets a job to try to get her own apartment and move forward into adulthood, Enid is still struggling to try to find her place in a new world.  This is obvious by her reluctance to get a job and move forward.  After pulling a prank on a lonely older man, she somehow ends up becoming a friend of his while breaking away from Rebecca.<br />Enid is a character you sometimes get angry with but at the same time understand that she is having trouble moving forward in life and feel empathy for.  She has a lot of talent yet no idea on what exactly it is she wants to do.  So she turns to the outcasts such as the crazy old man who sits waiting for a bus that never comes and the older Seymour.<br />This film is often sad but hilarious too.  You are always wondering just where this film will take you.  Even the end is the perfect touch though some might not care for it. Its a great film that is actually real and honest.  These are not cardboard cut-out characters, these are real girls.<br />In conclusion, it deserves all the buzz.  You will like this if you enjoy smart, independent films that aren't contrived and actually have some real meaning.  Brilliant!
B00003CXSP|2.0|**1/2 Journey with us back into the dankest recesses of the human psyche in Ridley Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; the long awaited sequel to &#8220;The Silence of the Lambs,&#8221; one of the darkest films ever to be awarded a Best Picture nod by the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In pop culture terms, Hannibal Lector has, of course, become the modern incarnation of implacable evil.  Not only do his cannibalistic acts represent the ultimate in human moral debasement and degradation, but his seeming indestructibility makes him all that much more horrifying.  His escape at the end of the first film served as a perfect setup for this sequel, as we find Lector living a life of seeming &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in Florence, Italy, just waiting for the proper moment to come out of &#8220;retirement.&#8221;  That moment arrives when Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who helped to save Hannibal&#8217;s last victim, is suddenly in the news again after an abortive and disastrous attempt to arrest a major criminal ends in the death of a number of her fellow officers.  Lector begins communicating with Clarice again, vowing to restart the game of intellectual cat-and-mouse he so enjoyed in the previous film.<br />For most of its running time, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; is a pretty enticing thriller.  Anthony Hopkins repeats the brilliant work he did in &#8220;Lambs,&#8221; making this most evil of movie villains both chillingly unreachable and bizarrely compelling.  With his clipped diction and often-incisive glimpses into the dark truths of the human psyche, he keeps the audience as emotionally off-balance as he does Clarice herself.  Indeed, we understand why she is both repelled and strangely attracted to this man.  Julianne Moore, who replaces Jody Foster in the role she originated ten years ago, brings an impressive reticence and hesitancy to this woman caught between her moral dictates and her desire to know more about the evil she is confronting.  In fact, apart from this explanation, many of her actions later in the film would be inexplicable unless we were to consider her utterly incompetent at her job.  My suspicion is that the filmmakers have something deeper in mind.  In addition, writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillan have created an interesting subplot involving Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective who uncovers Hannibal&#8217;s identity and thinks he can outsmart the devilish mastermind, capture him, turn him over to the authorities and make a fortune by collecting the reward money.  Giannini perfectly captures the subtle nuances that define this extraordinarily complex character, a man made up of many different, even conflicting moods and motives.<br />So far, so good.  But then - inevitably perhaps with material of this nature - the filmmakers cannot resist going overboard into downright incredibility and gruesomeness as the film approaches its denouement.  Even those familiar beforehand with the tenor of this story may well be appalled by some of the turns the film takes in its latter stages.  In the past, one used to encounter scenes like these only in low budget exploitation films like &#8220;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&#8221;  Now they are being fed &#8211; pardon the pun &#8211; to mass audiences in the guise of slickly marketed &#8220;entertainment.&#8221;  Poor Ray Liotta &#8211; I will never be able to look at him from here on out without seeing him in the condition he ultimately ends up in at the close of this film.  It is an image too indelible to ever be completely forgotten and goes well beyond the pale even for a film on this nasty a subject area. Moreover, whereas the first film ended on a note of clever, albeit macabre black humor, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; closes with a scene that is simply sickening in its unbridled grotesquerie.<br />Of course, complaining about the level of gruesomeness in a film about a serial cannibal may smack one as a bit of a Pollyanish stance for a knowledgeable viewer to take.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film, in which the writers and director exercise an admirable amount of restraint, prove that this material can be even more effective when it is dealt with through indirection than when it is all laid out for us in such grisly, graphic detail.  There is much to recommend &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; but unless you have a cast iron stomach and a very short memory span, you may well want to skip out before the final curtain is finally wrung down on the scene.  That is if you ever want to eat again.iewer to take.

0451527712|4.0|Over all I felt that this novel was rather captivating.  At all times Shelley is able to hold the reader in suspens and then jump into vivid details about the accounts of the story and the journey of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.  I would not consider this to be a horror story as much as it is a drama story with its fair share of action.  Shelley also lets the reader gain a personal attachment to each of the characters in the story by enclosing very detailed descriptions of their physical and personal attributes.  As the story progresses the reader can begin to sympathise with the characters which creates a rising interest for the duration of the novel.  Because this book has many different scopes that can be examined and critiqued, I would highly recomend this book to readers from 7th grade on up through professional levels of literature.  One of the best books that I have ever read.
B0000508U6|5.0|I hated this CD when I first heard it. But now, after I've listened to it at home I've decided it's one of the better CDs of 2001. Highly recommended.
0446525537|2.0|It had the same plot as \\"Love Story\\" complete with the required boy-falls-in-love-with-girl-from-opposite-end-of-the-social-structure and the required resistance of someone's father and, of course, the required terminal illness.  But other than different names, times, places and settings, it was the same book.  And I'm wondering -- is this allowed?  I think most of the readers of this books are too young to remember \\"Love Story\\" but now that the movie is out, won't the public catch on and blow the whistle about this obvious rewrite?
0792843584|5.0|It's always 1 or 5 (the occasional 2 or 4 are just cowards...).  This is a film you either adore or detest.  Those who adore it (moi, for instance, as the 5 star rating clearly indicates) are usually very patient movie watchers who like to watch a film unfold at its own pace. How many films can you name that are still going through exposition an hour and half into the film? <br />David Bern once said that movies are nothing but pictures and images; stories are just a trick to get you to watch them.  You could turn off the sound and mix up the reels (some probably think that happened when they saw it in the theatre), and this would still be a feast for the eyes.  Cimino's lush vision of Montana is overwhelming.  It's like a stroll through a moving Bierstadt exhibition. It contains pieces that are almost perfect acts of filmmaking - such as the skating sequence, which could stand alone as a short (the 1 star folks just stopped reading, muttering the word \\"dilatant\\" under their collective breaths).  <br />But despite its cinematic saturation, Heaven's Gate has a powerful, complex story.  It's a story about class barbarism, and how the American Aristocracy of the last century committed mass murder in the West, with the help of the Government and the Military.  It has a love story between two people who wouldn't have touched each other in the \\"civilized\\" East.  It has intense performances by Isabella Hupert, Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Sam Waterston, et al.   <br />Yes, this is clearly not a film for everyone - in fact, if it was made for anyone, it was for Michael Cimino - but it is a film that some of us are glad was made.  If you like LONG, CHALLANGING films by self-indulgent artists, rent it - and if you love it, you'll have to buy it; and if you hate it, well, you probably wasted five bucks and couldn't even get to the second tape...

B000001G6W|5.0|I bought this after it is highly recommended in Penguin and Gramophone guides. <br />  Excellently conducted by Karajan. I have 4 versions of this Symphony along with karajan's 1963 DG originals version.<BR>But this one is the best of them and I enjoyed it fully.<br />  One interesting fact is that 1978 Grammy award for classical music was given to Karajan's complete 1977 cycle (i.e including this one).<br /> Very well worth the purchase for Mid-price.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I found this movies to be one of action packed adventure as well as an insight into today's modern teen as well as the young adult.  This movie, to say the least, ROCKED!  The music was great, the plot better, and the man picked to play Dominic, could not have been anymore perfect.  I saw it originally in the Theater because my cousin made me go..I was not at all happy for the simple fact, I'm a female, in my mid to late twenties...I'm way out of the car racing scene and phase...but after watching this movie, I not only had to watch it again, I bought the DVD.  This is a movie you can watch with your boyfriend or husband and be just as happy...<br />The only thing I didnt like about it was the ending...it was one of those endings that makes you beg for more information...Is he still a cop?  Are they still friends?? Did he get Mia? Dominic ever get his sister into school??  Where did everyone go?  Did he get caught?  Will there be  a SEQUEL to answer these questions????  I Hope so...because I'll camp out to get the tickets!
0345347951|5.0|This novel has three different parts: Earth and the Overlords, The Golden Age and the Last Generation. The basic premise of the novel is that at some point in the 20th century, extremely powerful aliens (hereafter called the \\"Overlords\\") arrive and take over Earth.<br />However, the twist to the novel is that the aliens are not interested in conquest or any sort of domination. Rather, they saw Earth as a something of a tiresome chore, to be managed and put into order. While they are some that resist the aliens on principle, there is little to complain about. Hunger, disease, war are all gone. But all original art and science are gone; humanity starts to stagnate. <br />There is tremendous pressure in Part 1 for the Overlords to reveal themselves. They resist this pressure and remain mysterious. The Overlords say that they will reveal themselves in 50 years... When the Overlords reveal themselves, it is a moving scene. I don't want to reveal what happens but it was good.<br />Later on in Part 2 (The Golden Age), there are many benefits. Yet, not all was well.<br />\\"Profounder things had also passed. It was a completely secular age. Of the faiths that had existed before the coming of the Overloads, only a form of purified Buddhism - perhaps the most austere of all religions - still survived. The creeds that had been based upon miracles and revelation had collapsed utterly. With the rise of education, they had already been slowly dissolving, but for a while the Overlords had taken so sides in the matter. Though Karellen was often asked to express his views on religion, all that he would say was that a man's beliefs were his own affair, so long as they did not interfere with the liberty of others.\\" (page 74)<br />This is one trend that seems to plague much of science fiction, this assumption that science is true and that theistic religion has no basis in reality, that it is merely superstitious nonsense. Mainly because this is assumed with no argument or discussion, I find it distasteful and arrogant. Note, if you don&#8217;t want to spoil the best parts of the novel, don&#8217;t read anything further.<br />That aside, the novel was very enjoyable. There were several powerful scenes in the novel. The ending of the novel, with Karellen (the &#8216;leader&#8217; of the Overlords in charge of Earth) and the death of the last man in the world, was particularly poignant. In the middle part (The Last Generation), I think Clarke implies that mere pleasure is not enough. At this point in time, there was enough wealth to feed everybody and those who wanted luxuries had to work for them, but in the field of their choosing. Machines had eliminated manual labour and the only thing left was sports and other such amusements. Then, a new colony called New Athens is founded to encourage new art and new culture, something that had not been produced since the coming of the Overlords.<br />All through the novel, I wondered what did the title mean. In the final chapters of the novel, it is explained. Suddenly, a whole generation of children developed, indeed leapt forward into a whole new state. They could manipulate matter, did not need to eat and ultimately left Earth. It was the end of humanity&#8217;s &#8220;childhood.&#8221; The last man in the world had traveled, as a stowaway on an Overlord ship, to the Overlord home world. Due to the relativity of time in near light speed travel, he aged only six months while eighty years passed on Earth. He returned to an empty Earth&#8230;<br />This is the first Clarke novel that I have read and I was very impressed by it. The science is plausible but it is not dominant.

0451527712|4.0|Mary Shelly's Frankenstein was pretty good.  Although, many times i found my mind wandering to other things.  It was somewhat slow paced, and at times very boring.  I felt Mary Shelly left out some things that perhaps should have been discussed in order for the book to be a little more interesting (ie. how the monster actually came to life).  Even though the story was short, and unbelieveable i did however like how she made the monster a product of society- everyone hated and feared him, therefore he hated everyone else.  He could have been good, and lived a (somewhat) normal life.  The story has a deep meaning to it- it just took M. Shelly a long time to bring it out.  I would recommend this book if you like science fiction.
B00005R87Q|4.0|The critics slam this movie... and it is an easy target, action-oriented movies usually are. It's always easier to tear something down rather than build it up, but I'm going to give my best shot at defending my four star rating.<br />I will grant the critics that the acting is only \\"fair.\\" I will also grant that the plot is unbelievable some of the time.<br />Sure, the actors in this film are young and occasionally show their inexperience. However, I would say that Vin Diesel's performance stands out. Sure it is a \\"race movie,\\" and nobody will give him credit, but he took a one-dimensional character and gave Dom Turetto a bit of swagger, strength, but also a sense of fatherly protectionism and remorse for his past crime. Dom Turetto is the father-figure for the team of racers which is the focus of the plot. He is also the anti-hero to Paul Walker's protagonist, Brian Spilner/O'Connor.<br />As for the plot, I will concede that it is far-fetched, with its semi-truck hijackings, wiseguy police officers, and machinegun-toting Asian Youth Gangs. However, I would argue that the plot does its best to string the racing events together in a cohesive way while not turning into a \\"night and day\\" kind of movie in which you have a very distinct rift between the \\"race scenes\\" and the \\"dialogue scenes.\\" I compared this movie to another race movie called \\"Driven\\" (which was horrible). \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" did an outstanding job when compared to \\"Driven\\" in keeping the momentum throughout its dialogue sequences. The transitions are seamless, and the dialogue and direction are quick and to the point.<br />Where this movie excels is in the handling of the race sequences. The choreography of the auto races or the semi-truck hijackings are unlike anything we have seen. To show these types of images with real street-legal cars is something that captures the imagination of many young Americans. Each \\"race sequence\\" is unique from the others, either because of the cars, the setting,time of day, or the adversity facing the protagonists (shotgun-weilding semi-truck driver, freight train on a collision-course, or the aforementioned machinegun-toting Asian Youth Gang).<br />I believe this movie has been so popular because of the themes that emerge from the periphery of the storyline. The story and action convey a sense of family, competition, hard work, and equality between the sexes. The racing teams represented in the movie allow their members to cross barriers of race and sex, exposing close-knit groups which help each other excel in the competitive world of drag racing. Through hard work and the support of one's teammates, any youth in America could build his or her own dream machine and race against the best in the city.<br />The DVD has excellent visual and audio qualities, and the DVD \\"extras\\" are outstanding. The \\"making of...\\" and director commentary sections are strong and insightful. In the deleted scenes section, the viewer will find a great scene in which Dom, Brian, and the other men of the \\"team\\" are outside the garage drinking beer and telling the stories of how they became racers and how one's life changes after becoming addicted to the adrenaline-powered life of a racer. Why this scene was cut from the movie is inexplicable.<br />\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" will entertain you many times over if you keep an open mind and look past some of the less believable elements. It may not impress you with an Oscar-worthy performance or storyline, but for those who accept its limitations and enjoy its successes, it is an entertaining movie you will watch again and again.
0679720200|3.0|Philip, I really appreciated your review.  It made me laugh really loudly, and several times.  Especially the bit about how four stars lined up look ok.  I haven't read the book either.  I just gave it three stars cause i like the number 3.
6305364648|5.0|I really disagree with the reviewer who said that True Lies is a typical action movie.  While it includes plenty of action, it also has wonderful romance and comedy.  After seeing this movie twice at the theater I purchased the DVD and have watched it several times and will watch it at least once every few months as it's become a family favorite.<br />If you haven't seen this movie because you think it will be a typical Arnold Schwarzenneger action flick then you are really missing out!  The plot is hilarious with plenty of comedy from Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold.  It's completely unpredictable and very entertaining.<br />One of the few movies I'll give 5 stars!  Loved it and I'm looking forward to True Lies 2!
B00003CXXP|2.0|The film would have been just barely tolerable had they left the child frozen in the ice.  Much of the film's imagery is beautiful, but the plot goes from fascinating to ludicrous rather abruptly (two-thirds of the way through).  By the end the audience was laughing, what with the teddy bear that has miraculously saved a lock of the mother's hair and the valium-voiced aliens.  And talk about Oedipal endings!  Certainly an embarassment for all parties involved.
6304233639|3.0|I wonder why Arthur C. Clarke wasn't given a nod for the idea of the mother ship and baby ships. That scene seems to have come directly from 'Childhood's End'. I haven't read all the reviews, but it seems some points have not been addressed; for example, world unity. The world is so divided by ideologies, language, beliefs, economic conditions, currency, etc. that it would take a world-wide threat (like an alien attack or another black plague) to unify all the people. This film, shallow as it is in other respects, illustrates that. Also, this film was 'centered' in America, so the filmmakers naturally concentrated on America, with 'cameos' of members of other countries.  I resent being told that 'the worst part of the movie was America' (see above comment about devisivness, rudeness and negativism). Obviously, I am American, but I have Swedish and English (and other) roots. I actually consider myself a citizen of Earth. The Earth, this little blue planet is my home. So, let's try to take that 'think globally' seriously.<BR>I rather liked the movie with it's humor and special effects (I guess I'm easily entertained), and my wife always cries at the sad parts. Movies are like beauty - in the eye and ear of the beholder. It's easy to find fault with things, but much harder to find the good, the higher ground, the motivation. Makes you wonder what kind of movies the reviewers rave over...

The musical ability is staggering and ,especially on &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, James La Brie's voice is fantastic.<br />Disc 2 is a lot more melodic and probably more of what you would expect from the Dreamers but musical ability once again shines through coupled with perfect songcrafting.<BR>Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is not an album I would start a Dream Theater collection with. You need to have sampled all their wares to get to this masterpiece. I own all their recordings but this one really is the best !!
B00005RYKV|3.0|Kitano Takeshi's first American directorial effort plays it safe thematically, while upgrading production quality and the level of violence.  BROTHER is almost a remake of SONATINE, including his trademark touches of long, quiet scenes followed by sudden eruptions of violence, important events taking place offscreen (which Kitano learned from Mizoguchi Kenji) and so on.  There's even a reference to a shootout visible only via flashing lights in SONATINE.<br />Another odd thing is the movie taking time to explicate the value system of the Japanese yakuza, as if Kitano felt it necessary to show to American audience the ABCs of the yakuza genre.  Seemingly no one remembered to tell him that there already is Sidney Lumet's excellent YAKUZA with Robert Mitchum and Takakura Ken, wherein Mitchum cuts off his pinkie in the end to show appreciation for Takakura.  (James Shigeta, a veteran Japanese American actor, who plays Yamamoto's accountant in BROTHER, was in it too)<br />BROTHER is a disappointment to those who take Kitano seriously as a cineaste and not just a genre filmmaker, but the film is not without its charms and strengths.  The central relationship between Omar Epps and Beat Takeshi is well-developed, and even though the redundancy of the very last scene has been pointed out, I would have to say that it works in the context of Epps' character.<br />As for the censorship, a mid-80s actioner such as THE CHALLENGE was far more violent than BROTHER, so I have no idea why they even bothered.  In fact, THE CHALLENGE clearly showed a man's intenstines dangling from a sword slash, whereas a similar scene was obviously censored in this movie.
B00005UEAR|5.0|If there was ever a band to receive credit for their work it would definetly have to be Dream Theater. SDOIT is just simply their best work yet. Unlike other bands unable to capture and improve their music style, DT has once again proved that they can still come up with songs that make you think and head-bang at the same time, songs which are worth listening too. Unfortunetly bands like these are the ones that do not receive the credit they deserve. If there was a real grammy award DT would have at least 4 by now. DT is the kind of band that makes u want to learn how to play an instrument and pushed it to the next level so N'sync, limpbizkit, metallica, britney watch and learn how the pros do it.
B00005V9QJ|4.0|What can be said that already hasn't been said about Sade? Well one thing I found out about them is that they are INCREDIBLE live. I recently saw them on their Lover's Rock tour and was blown away. I thought it would be a mellow crowd, but the performance was very uplifting and inspiring. The band's intensity and Sade's vocals were equally matched by the intense praise and cheers of the eager crowd. And in that same vein there is this cd. It never fails to disappoint. Highlights of the disc include the new, soulful \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart,\\" \\"Cherish the Day\\" and the climax to the show. In all, afer a seven year hiatus, Sade proved to America that they've still got it. They put on a show with style and grace in their own inimitable style, and we can only pray that seven more years won't go by until they next grace us with their music.
B00005T30L|5.0|I'm a big Thora Birch fan and have been for many years and like Christina Ricci i feel she is one of the most talented and overlooked actresses out there. Both have turned out great performances (Ricci has been given more roles though but Birch was perfect in American Beauty)but this by far has to be Thora's best film. She finally gets a good leading role and for once i can actually say a comic to big screen has turned out 100% (the only other comic film near this is the 1989 Batman, which of course in in a totally different world all together). It does amaze me that critics actually enjoyed this little indie film because they are quick to point out minor problems and make them huge deals but while i don't always agree with their picks i do with this one. Ghost World may not be Oscar caliber work but it would've been nice to see it nominated more for the other awards shows but sadly it wasn't. Steve Buschemi turns in another wonderful role (all this guy has to do really is play himself and he comes off weird and it always seems to work)and Scarlett Johansson also turns in a wonderful performance. In a way Birch's charchter Enid reminds me of myself and my views and how i just don't want to change or do anything when my friends they all have done more than me and made efforts to move on but will never truly be happy. Very great movie and i will also agree that the dvd is lacking alot. I've never understood why some films get over the top dvd (even some awful undeserving films do)and then some get nothing at all and makes to actually wonder why they bothered to relase it on dvd in the 1st place. They could've at least threw in some bios, and a longer making of documentary and maybe even some background info on the comic book the movie is based on. Great film and i strongly recomend it to everyone out there!
B000002JS8|4.0|OLD REVIEW:<br />i know some people say this is the greatest AC/DC's best album, but i found it was a huge disappointment. songs like girls got rythem and touch toio much were just weak, and shot down in flames, get it hot, and love hungry man were only ok. on the other hand, highway to hell and walk all over you shred, and beating around the bush, if you want blood, and night prowler are all good. still, if you want bon scott-era AC/DC, look elsewhere.<br />NEW REVIEW:<br />i gave this album a few more listens recently, and to tell you the truth its really grown on me. it's certainly a fine exit for the legendary bon scott, the best rock n roll singer of all time!
B00003CXTG|3.0|My thoughts on \\"Pearl Harbor\\" are two fold, both good and bad. The Good portion of this review is regarding the graphics used to dramatize the attack. I have never seen anything so spectacular as far as attack footage. To me the downside of the movie is the fact that far too much time was devoted to the love triangle, and not nearly enough time was devoted to the \\"behind the scenes story\\" of what the personnel in both Hawaii and Washington D.C. actually knew about what was about to happen to the naval and air bases located on the island. It is the opinion of this author that the movie \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" was of greater interest because of the detail which it went into regarding the planning of the attack as well as what was going on in Washington. In conclusion I would recommend that anyone who is a fan of military movies see \\"Pearl Harbor\\".
B00005V0X5|5.0|Oh my god. I don't know where to begin with this classic thrash masterpiece. The debut album for one of the best thrash bands around. Skull Beneath The Skin, Last Rites/Loved To Death, Rattlehead, Looking Down The Cross, need I say more. These are all very technical and incredible songs. With the audio being so clear now, Gars drumming was incredible, you couldn't hear it on the original recording because the audio was too low. Dave and Chris's guitar playing is precise, and David's bass is amwesome. Dave's vocals are intense also. More to the point, if you are a big fan of early thrash, you won't be dissapointed with this one. And it's a nice bonus to add those demos as well. Get this one, I HIGHLY reccomend it.
0767805712|3.0|I love Science Fiction Movies. Most of the action movie junk out there barely qualifies so when i heard of Gattaca i thought here would be a great sci-fi movie that would challenge the mind as well as the eyes. As far as video quality goes - this is a great DVD - it looks wonderful, i didnt see the Superbit version but you won't be disappointed with the regular version on a large screen 16X9 Television Set. The sets are terrific and the cinematography breathtaking - HOWEVER - the visual style (i.e -thirties era suits, weird electric cars) were unoriginal and got tiresome - we've seem them before in movies like Brazil and Robocop, the story didnt advance by ripping off the style of these movies. Ultimately the problem with the film is that it doesnt go anywhere and lacks a believable script - none of the characters are deeply developed to the point that the viewer cares for them and the film doesnt progress from the first half hour after establishing the theme of a genetic elite. Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman are good actors - and play their parts well - but there was nothing to ultimately challenge the viewer.
B000001Y5X|5.0|before all the publicity, there was this. this is a great album. its raw and flawed but dark and dense.  this is where it all started.  2 of my faves are wrapped in plastic and lunchbox.

B00005RFAI|5.0|If you thought Pink couldn't top the success of her first CD then you were wrong. The open diary that is Pink's Sophomore CD &quot;Missundaztood&quot; is an excellent release from other Fluff CD's where all the songs sound the same. Dance-able and upbeat, With songs such as &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; your head will be bopping and your feet moving. <BR>Pink says it best when she says &quot;Tired of being compared to Damn Britney Spears...&quot; &quot;Missundaztood&quot; casts Pink out of the Tennie-bopper music shadow. <BR>Pink also tackles Divorce and the feeling of lonliness in her follow-up CD.<BR>All in all if you enjoy pink and liked her first CD then you will LOVE &quot;Missundaztood&quot; so go buy it!
B00005NI5Y|3.0|well, it wasn't bad. not by a long shot. i am a little dissapointed in the new sound. i guess i am just more of a fan of dylan's old folk songs, more than his rock and roll. But i have always enjoyed him, up until the 80's. then hee seemed to go sour for a while. but in 88, when he made \\"Down in the Groove\\" and in the earliy 90's, i was happy to see his return to hard core folk music. i thought \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" was a fine album, deservning of its praise, but again i am saddened by the switch back to a lot of electric. <BR>   Love and theft had its share of good tracks, High Water was fabulous, and Mississippi sounded suspiciously like the type from \\"Time out of Mind\\". As for the others... i could take or leave them. not what its cracked up to be. But if you like Dylan, might aswell buy it.
B000002KCC|5.0|Neil Youngs Tonights the Night is Young at his most bleak, ragged and harrowing. It is an extremely dark and depressing, as its supposed to be. Young along with Crazy Horse and Nils Lofgren are singing about the deaths of two of Youngs close friends, Danny Whitten guitarist with the aforementioned Crazy Horse and former roadie of CSN&Y Bruce Berry. Both died fron drug abuse and the album is both a tribute to the guys and alook at the whole drug culture in general. Young and the band at times sound drunk, drugged or both with none of the polish of previous albums. This is initially the hardest part about this album, the sheer sloppiness of the recording and the out of tune guitar parts and ragged vocals. Its meant to be of course. However the record execs didnt like this at first and left it siting on the shelf for two years, the label jacket says 1975 but it was recorded in 1973.<br />Sadly drugs and rock n roll seem to go hand in hand with many legendary musicians dying over the years. Thankfully Young and the band survived but many didnt. If u like dark music in the vein of pink Floyds Dark side of the moon u will like this. If u are new to Neil Young or didnt like pink Floyds masterpiece then stay away from this one. Get after the gold rush or harvest instead. It is important to read what is written in the inlay card .\\"This album was made for Danny Whitten and Bruce Berry who lived and died for Rock and Roll\\". Enough said. Thank u Neil for this amazing journey of self discovery that u have taken us on. Danny Whitten, Bruce Berry R.I.P. Keep on rocking in the free world guys.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I don't get it. Why does everyone think this movie is so great? I hate the characters. Shrek is mean and the donkey is annoying. There weren't any characters that I could relate to and I just didn't like any of them. The plot is okay, but nothing special. Plus it's not that funny. Not crack up laughing, spit out your pop kind of funny...
B000053V0E|3.0|Starring Charlie Sheen, Hot Shots is a parody of Top Gun with a flavor of Airplane thrown in. Funny, Stupid and Silly action make this a must RENT. If you really like this you might want to buy it just to view it's comedy again and again. The Sequel(Hot Shots: Part Deux) is alright, nothing special. <br />I recommend Airplane if you liked this movie.

6304078102|1.0|Terrible in every way.  Aweful acting, an insultingly stupid story, and horrible music.  This movie is a parody of itself.  The ultimate insult coming at the end when the \\"opus\\" is the worst piece of music ever written--the type of thing that would make a 'real' music teacher crawl out a window.  I can't believe reviews on this site say this is a tribute to teachers.  God forbid our schools would fill with more Mr. Hollands who hit on students and don't know anything about the subject they teach.  If you like sappy, overly-sentimental, long, not very clever flicks, enjoy.  If you have any taste or sense of decency, STAY AWAY!!!
B00005YU1P|5.0|While watching this movie one is forced to anylyze ones own dreams. The dialogue is entirely interesting. It is so intelligent and thought provoking. Every line and word evokes a more and more pleasing harmonies in the brain. To follow along with the script, the visuals of this film are no less outstanding. A technique called \\"rotoscope\\", in which the scene is filmed, then animated over(in this film, by three different animators at onece)gives it a non stop eye candy. A complete and welcome deviation from the norm, that provokes thought instead of vacuous violence.
B000021Y74|5.0|Run Lola Run is alot like &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; only extremely better.<BR>It features three different scenarios all following the same girl Lola, who must get 100,000 marks for her boyfriend Manni in 20 minutes, or else he will be killed. As Lola runs through the streets of Berlin to an amazing techno soundtrack (which I highly recommend) she passes by people in brief moments,which show a short series of shots describing the rest of their lifes with no words. In the first two scenarios, in which the outcome is tragic, both Lola and Manni seemingly freeze time, then it starts all over again. The film explains how things could happen differently, depending on what a person does, this proven by how the outcome of each scenario is different, and how the people Lola ecounters' lifes are different in each scenario. Some of the best parts are when Lola screams, shattering glass, and silencing everyone around her. The last scenario, which has the best outcome, is obviously the one people would choose to end the movie, however a question remains. Which scenario really did happen and which two are simply theory? The film also gives a good example of the multiple worlds theory, which suggests that everytime a person makes a choice, a new world is created where everything is the same, except the choice the made and its consequences. This proposes that all the scenarios did happen, except in different places with different outcomes, judging Lola's and those around her's choices. The film has a very interesting beginning, with shadowy figures walking around in a crowd, while a mysterious voice asks philisophical questions along with appearences by the people Lola runs by in the movie At first it does not make sense, but after the movie is over, one gains a better understanding of how the beginning fits into the rest of the movie. The greatest German movie I've ever seen, any fan of good films should see it, and if they like it as much as I did, buy it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge hearkens back to a time when movies had the fresh feeling of adolescence, intoxicated by their own possibilities.  It's a deliciously offbeat film, completely aware of its own audacity.  Not only does it reestablish the movie musical with verve and sincerity, but it does so in a unique and defining way.  By mixing turn-of-the-century and contemporary icons, the craziness of the Moulin Rouge is updated for today's desensitized viewers, giving us an idea of just how liberating and frightening it must have been to visit that infamous dance hall all those years ago.  It really \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\"   <BR>   <BR>Christian (Ewan McGregor) comes to the Paris of 1899 an idealistic youth, searching for the materialization of his firm beliefs in truth, freedom, beauty, and love.  Like a prodigal son he strays to the forbidden world of the Moulin Rouge, a decadent world of sex, glamour, prostitution, and bohemian indulgence.  It is there, through the frenetic tempo of extravagant sets and costumes, that he finds Satine (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful but jaded courtesan.  Falling into a boyish infatuation, Christian confronts Satine, realizing his love, and her's in return.  But their hope is dwindled, as Satine has sold her body in contract to the terrible Duke.  Besides that, she is embittered with a horrible and ultimately tragic secret.<BR>   <BR>The story is clichd to be sure (it's similarities to Camille often make you wonder if writers weren't merely using an old clich, but an old movie), but it seems to work, if only because of director Baz Luhrman's wholehearted belief in its values.  He digs down into the deeply hidden heart of his story, replacing the dirt of a hundred cheap melodramas with a visual artistry unrivaled by anything in years.  In this way it expresses the sincere, almost raw emotion these stories once contained in a completely new way.  Did we say completely new way?!<BR>   <BR>The visual artifice of Moulin Rouge is astoundingly fresh!It's painterly but kinetic in a way only a movie could be.  The fabulous choreography, music, set design, performances... all blend to form a visual, aural, and emotional experience like no other!  It has the Technicolor richness of a 50's Hollywood musical, but often the feel of a music video.  The visual style ranges from somber pop-up book, to giddy cartoon, to lilting romantic dreamworld, to fantastic Bollywood production, and everything fits!  That director Luhrman has managed to bring this all to the screen with such clarity is somewhat astonishing.<BR>   <BR>But of course we could not write a review of Moulin Rouge without mentioning the bizarre choice of music.  Luhrman has unusual confidence in his eccentricities.  But then again who else could take \\"Roxanne\\" and turn it into a beautiful, erotic, haunting tango?  And who knew \\"Like a Virgin\\" as sung by Jim Broadbent could serve as a goosepimply, if ironically bitter, release? <BR>   <BR>Of course it could also help that most of these songs are sung by the rapturous voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Their performances are beautiful and sincere, particular Ewan's (that I feel the need to call him by his first name only proves how close to him I became).  He becomes his role with unbelievable passion and heart.  He has a bit of something that goes beyond acting, he has the magic of a great performance.  He can embody youth, charming goofiness, and shattered idealist, and if he wasn't in love with Nicole Kidman!  All this he expresses with an absolutely angelic singing voice (even its occasional weaknesses serve as charming strengths).  You fall in love not only with him, but for him.  The Academy not honoring him with at least a nomination would be a great disappointment.<BR>   <BR>Nicole Kidman is both sexy and beautiful, like the film itself a daring blend of old and new.  She's part 30's glamour queen, part pop star, a little Marlene Dietrich, a little Madonna.  When discussing Moulin Rouge I'vefound that many would not see it solely because Nicole was in it, and this is sad.  Her performance here is excellent, displaying her full range of talents.  She expresses her usual cool seductiveness, but also a surprising comic flair, and at times an aching emotion.  And did we mention her singing?  Like Ewan, Nicole has a hidden vocal talent.  Her voice puts resounding meaning into something that was once just something dumb on the radio.  Her efforts have resulted in numerous awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and at least and Oscar nomination is certainly on its way.<BR>   <BR>The way all these unique visuals, and performances are organized is also extremely unique.  The editing style has been criticized as frenetic, and poorly structured, but I would have to disagree.  If one watches this film carefully enough they with realize that each cut serves in the dance, by punctuating each note.  This becomes most apparent in the previously mention Tango de Roxanne, one of the many brilliantly choreographed, grandiose dance numbers.  As the momentum and emotion expressed by the dance and song builds, the editing follows, rapidly increasing in cuts until finally bursting like a heart overwhelmed by its own beating.  Similarly, when Christian first enters the Moulin Rouge the frightening madness of it all is perfectly captured by Luhrman's crazed scissors.                 <BR>   <BR>That Moulin Rouge has completely polarized critics is of no surprise.  A large group of great films have done so, and I think this one is both a socially, and artistically important one.  There are many who have called it a ridiculous piece of \\"pop trash.\\"  What these critics seem to forget is that Astaire and Rogers were the biggest pop icons of their era, and their stories were no more original.  Ok, maybe Ewan and Nicole aren't exactly Fred and Ginger, but you get my point.  Still it is exactly these critics who complain that American film studious never churn out anything original, and then turn to panning a film like this.  <BR>   <BR>But regardless of how anyone else sees it, I would call Moulin Rouge a great film, and doubtlessly my favorite of the year.  It is easily deserving of awards in the majority of Oscar categories.  Acting, editing, set and costume design, direction, everything is in its own way unique and beautiful.  It may look like Busby Berkeley on acid, but beneath the extravagance is a beating emotion.  In a film industry dominated by cynicism, it is relieving to find a movie that dares to be sincere.  Say what you will, but this Oscar season I'll be rooting for the most opulent, energetic, emotional, beautiful, brilliant, audacious movie of the year.  Moulin Rouge anyone?
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This is a really good soundtrack, but it lacks something. Lots of songs from the movie are not on this CD. &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; is missing, as well as &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;, and the remix with Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;/&quot;You Can, Can Can!&quot;/and Harry Zidler's song. I have heard of the Moulin Rouge 2 CD that is coming out, so they may be on that one. I hope so...<br />This CD is entertaining,though. I like &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, &quot;You're Song&quot;, &quot;Elephant Love Medley&quot;, &quot;Come What May&quot;, and a few others. &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; is good, also, as well as &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot;. If you get this CD, you'll enjoy it, and you shouldn't be too disappointed in it.<br />Buy it today!
B000002UW1|4.0|Docoment is a great record, not as great as Lifes rich Pageant but great. The first with longtime producer Scott Litt. The sound is a little heavier than on the previous. Loud drums, the drums are loud as well on &quot;Lifes&quot;... but the drums are more fat and pushed in front here. The opening track &quot;finest worksong&quot; is fantastic with a droning feel to it. Kind of hyphotic and heavy wich is rare in Rem songs. &quot;Welcome to the..&quot; is also good...<BR>Melody and mood. the third song Ex..MC.... is a strange one because the lyrics and the music seems linked together with a hint of irony because the subject matter of the lyrics dont sync with the upliftning poppy sound of the for example ...verses ......... loyal to the bank of america....<BR>then the song change direction to a rythmic bompy landscape where mills sings lead and then a change again. Strange composition but really good. Disturbence in the HH.. is one of my favorites on the album. Great melodies and rythm.<BR>STrange is the title of a rocker that is nothing more than a filler in my ears. Not half as good as the rockier tracks on the Lifes.....<BR>Its the end of the world as we know it and i feel fine..... A great and original songwriting style thats totally unique and a classic REM. Sad to say that ive heard it just one time to many and im kind of tired of that song.<BR>The one i love stands the test of time better. A beutiful song but not the best on Document.<BR>After the one i love the album moves inte a interesting section with a few experimental songs.... The ones im thinkin of are first Fireplace ..... a great track where the brass works great with the rock. Great mood in that one.<BR>Another strong is King of Birds that has almost a psycadelic touch to it with halftones and march drums. Great one there. The closer oddfellows local 151 is kind of boring.<BR>Anyhow Document is a really good ReM record and a must for fans.<BR>It has a very political feel to it.
B000002J23|4.0|DRAMA (3.75 stars)  I'm a big fan of Progressive Music and have always wanted to like 'Yes' more than I did.  To me, many of their recordings were either too ostentatious/directionless or the opposite; veering off to the apex of polished sound. They produced abundant works in the 70's, but ya kinda wish that they would have spent a little more time in the studio, tightening up the pieces.  They had great success in the 80's, but ya kinda wish they would have left the compositions in a rawer, expansive state.  This 1980 release is the divergence point for both sounds and is the vision of the band that should have risen earlier and persevered longer. <br />I don't know if the moniker of this effort alludes to some dissension in the ranks prior to its release, but this is the first Yes album on which Jon Anderson does not appear. Fronting the band is a very capable Trevor Horn and supplanting Wakeman on keys is the more concise stylings of Geoff Downes.  Those that have a problem with second and third incarnations of a band,  best remember that Howe and Wakeman were not in the original Yes lineup, nor is Gilmour original to Floyd or Peart to Rush. This album has founding member, Chris Squire, ascending to a more dominant role than on any previous release.  His virile, roaming bass prowess receives a larger platform here than usual.  On vocals, Squire doubles his pipes with Horn's to provide a full, harmonic lead.  I assume that this was done to create the illusion that Anderson was present during the sessions, and in some instances you're actually duped.  Songs like, 'Does it Really Happen', foreshadow a writing style that Squire would bring to the next album, 90125. <br />Steve Howe does all of his work on hard-body guitars, giving the music a heavier edge.  Downes delivers inventive keyboards, but the structure of the songs do not provide room for the type of Wakemanesque wailing of yesteryear.  The standout tracks are 1,2,5 and 6.  This is a middle ground for YES and the band is much more focused here than on 1978's lackluster 'Tormato'.  Shortly after Drama was released, Howe left the band to form ASIA.  Squire, White and Downes would stay onboard for the next project as Anderson returns to the vocal slot.  Horn relegates himself to production duties and Trevor Rabin acts as catalyst, fostering an entirely new dynamic in the music.<br />I picked up this title on a whim (because the horrendous state of  music at present causes me to revert to an era where integrity was still part of the musical equation) and was not disappointed.  There is a lot to be said in favor of  this unjustifiably dismissed album.  Another YES recording where all the planets seem to have been aligned above the studio is 1974's 'Relayer'.
B000002LOE|4.0|This breakthrough record was the first one i heard with REM. In fact the first contact wiht the band was the &quot;losing my religion&quot; video on MTV. What to say about it today... <BR>It´s not the strongest one but it´s not as mediocre as some people think it is. It´s actually a really strong as most REM albums are.<BR>The opener &quot;Radio song&quot; is a really melodic, great song but the krs1-rap-thing should have been left out. It sounds forced and silly today and doesn´t fit the REM enviroment any good. Losing my religion is a super great song but I´ve heard it one time to much .... so it´s not my fav today. Low is a mood thing and a great album track. The following &quot;Near wild heaven&quot; is so great so I cant´t get enough of it! Love that one,, perhaps the best on the album. Mike Mills rules. Endgame.... alright a little moodsong... but thats all it is.<BR>Shiny happy people is rediculed by many fans and maybe thats not what we want REM to sing about but it´s a funny song with great melodies and harmonies.<BR>Belong is one of the best. A great storytelling song filled with beutiful harmonies and moods. Experimenting playful REM at thier best. Half a world away is a more than ok song in the same school as the softer songs on Green but not as good.<BR>Texarkana is a faster song with discent melodies. Good song. More Mills.<BR>Country Feedback is ok. <BR>&quot;Me in Honey&quot; is wonderful. Fantastic. Melodic. Beutiful. One of the greatest closing tracks in the history of Rem-recordings.<br />The album came in the right time for REM to hit big and they delivered the right singles to make it happen but it´s not their strongest moment, albumwise. <BR>With a 5 star guide it´s hard to give the right amont of stars. The 10 scale is easier to work wihin. I gave &quot;Fables...&quot;, wich is one of my favorites, 4 stars but thats very near 5 and this record is very close to 3 but it´s still not just 3 .. which means just ok.
B00003CXB6|1.0|This is probably one of the worst movies i've ever seen.The first movie had special effects which,at the time of release were incredible and glossed over many of the flaws in JP.In this movie it's all been done before so the actual movie comes through...this is too bad for the movie makers.
B000002UVZ|5.0|A new direction for Rem. More in your face, louder and more direct than the previos records. That´s not a bad thing because like all great bands Rem moves on and takes a new aproach with every new release. The opening track Begin the Begin marks that change in a very clear way. It´s very different from where \\"Fables\\" took off. When I bought this record I wasn´t as found with this song as every ohter Rem fan seems to be, but it has grown on me and I really love the song now. The second one, These Days is a pure energyloaded masterpiece of rock, loaded with positive power and strength. In my opinion the best track on the album and one of the best Rem songs ever. At least among the faster, rockier Rem-songs. Love that one. /// Fall on me..... do I need to write about it. Beutiful and great. Cuyahoga follows..... another good track that keeps the standard of this LP. Then you get the fast and driving Hyena-rocker.... a fantastic song and in my opinon one of the best on Life´s...<br />.....hmmm underneath the bunker.... a funny little hidden one... <BR>Flowers of Guatumala.... a 10 of 10 song... so beutiful I can´t find words .....GREAT / MASTERPIECE fantastic guitarline/solo from Buck in the middle of the song. Then comes another hailed Rem song... fast and filled with energy...\\"I belive\\" I think it´s good but not that super-great like many other rem-fans usually think. Maybe it will grow on me. <BR>\\"What if we give it away\\". Good, but not more in my opinion.<BR>\\"Just a touch\\" follows and provides one of the rockiest moments in the Rem history. In \\"Swan swan H\\" Stipe gives us his obscure storytelling and we love it...... Good haunting song.<BR>Superman, another hidden track closes the album. Mike Mills steps forward and delivers ......funny and melodic<br />Life´s rich Peagent is a fantastic REM record. One of the best. A solid work from the one of the greatest bands. Even though I don´t find all the songs masterpieces as on ........ yea you´ve heard it before..... \\"Automatic for the people\\" I give it 5 stars but very near 4. There´s so much things to love here.<BR>Great album cover as usual..... one of my favorites.... That reason alone is enough to get this on vinyl also. <BR>This and Fables are my favorite Rem albums of the 80´s. Very different in mood and aproach but great in their own way.<BR>Buy this one!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXB6|3.0|I think the theatrical version of The Lost World was okay,but the Tv version is way better than this version.The Tv version has many scenes that were edited out from the theatrical versionlike,the scene when Roland and his friend are talking in a bar,the scene when the T-Rex's try to attack Kelly in the High,high,the scene after the brief encounter with the Stegasaurous,and many more that might have made the movie sense.My opinion is to catch the Tv version on Fox,or just buy the DVD and watch the scenes im talking about.
B000002LFU|4.0|Green is a fantastic record. some REM (IRS-period fanatics) set this record below records like &quot;Dead letter office&quot; wich is totally silly. &quot;Dead letter&quot; is an interestning collection for the fans but thats all it is, a scrapbook, not great when it comes to solid songwriting. <BR>That said, Green is a sparkling great record that delivers mood swings like no other record. The songs are either uplifting, energy-filled or slow, reflective and melancholic.<BR>All energy-driven rocky songs are Great...<BR>Pop song, Get up, Stand, Turn you inside out, Orange CR.  etc <BR>..........You are the everything, the wrong child and hairshirt are so calm and beutiful you feel the songs eat their way into your heart. Almost all songs are fantastic, but &quot;I remember California&quot; sounds like a remake of odd fellows local 151 to me.<BR>The sound of this record is more in style with OUT OF TIME than &quot;Document&quot; a year earlier.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Pearl Harbor is probably one of the most underrated film of 2001.I watched this movie on a bad Tv and widescreen video and I still loved it.I didn't know what to expect when I saw it.The trailer looked very good but because of all the bad reviews I expected it to suck.It didn't.Sure,some of it is a bit baised and some of the romance is corny,but what do you expect?Another Titanic?The special effects were at their best and the acting was good.The silent,slow motion scenes were also effective,as they are in a war movie.I didn't care what people say about Pearl Harbor.It's my praise.
B000002MG1|5.0|I cant find the words to describe this miracle but Ill try. With this record REM reached their peak in music, art, lyrics, melodies, harmonies and moods. Its been said so many times before but this album is so great every fan and all the critics say it is. Its a miracle in musicmaking. One rewiewer here wrote &quot;Grace and dignity&quot; and that sums it up wonderfully. Everybody knows that Rem never can deliver something like this again. Its not possible, but Revael is the closest in the time after.<BR>Theres no meaning to get into any specific songs here because they are all masterpieces. There are not many records (of all time) that can be said about. The step from &quot;Out of time&quot; is enormous. The peak of creativity and brilliance.<BR>No other Rem album is near this. <BR>Brave and beutiful filled with heart and soul.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This was a very sad movie that is one of the best movies i've ever seen.Ben Afflick and Josh Hartnett are good together.The special effects were really great,and the attack sequence was very dramatic.I think everyone should love this movie because its one of a kind.Hollywood would never make a great movie like this one.
B000003TAL|5.0|The Cure was without a doubt my favorite band throughout High School.  I didn't really listen to much else because I was so taken aback by them.  It's hard even to talk about them anymore because of where the band has gone.  I know they can't make perfect records forever, though.<br />What does The Cure have to do with Sonic Youth and this review?  I'll tell you.  A few of my friends drove 8 hours to pick me up so we could go see The Cure live in Dallas during the prayer tour in 1989.  It was my first &quot;real&quot; concert without either of my parents.  As we were driving to Dallas through Oklahoma, one of my friends put in the cassette for &quot;Daydream Nation.&quot;  It was the first time I had ever heard Sonic Youth before and all I can remember is thinking that The Cure finally had some competition.  <br />My tastes were pretty limited, but I was very excited to have another group that I could get in to.  Needless to say, I became a Sonic Youth fan that day.  &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is as good today as I remember it being then.  Thus, making it a true masterpiece.  When an album is as timeless as this, you need to have it for your collection.  Regardless of how often you listen to it.  It's one that I don't listen to very often anymore because I've heard it so many times.  Occasionally I will play it and the memories instantly come running back.<br />Of all the Sonic Youth albums that have been released, my opinion would tell me that this is their best.  I really like &quot;Goo&quot; and &quot;Dirty&quot; almost as much.  If I had to pick one, though, this would be the one.  &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is the most cohesive collection of songs that Sonic Youth have released.  <br />The first track, &quot;Teenage Riot,&quot; shows Sonic Youth at their best.  It's one of their more melodic songs to date.  The band is known for their experimental approach for the most part.  However, occasionally they play some very melodic tunes.  The second song, &quot;Silver Rocket,&quot; is a perfect example of the experimental approach I referenced above.  The next two songs, &quot;The Sprawl&quot; and &quot;'Cross the Breeze&quot; are two examples of Sonic Youth's more melodic style.  Every song has it's own nuance.  They're all great.<br />No matter how you look at this album, it's one you should own.  The great thing is that if you aren't familiar with Sonic Youth, you have plenty of albums to hear.  They've been going at it for years now with the same great results.
B00003CXTG|3.0|An acquaintance of mine,offered a rather thoughtful insight on the cinema of Michael Bay.\\"People are actually stupider after watching his films\\".Someone later grogarglued that bad movies have never been proven to reduce peoples iq but he's missing the point.I must admit I enjoyed his past work.I engoyed the Rock all the way through.Then Armageddon that tooked itself too seriously but at least it was a killer movie.Now Pearl Harbor.Its a sad movie from a film critic's point of view.He's removed from a basic understanding of purpose of art.Pearl Harbor is pathetic to watch.Watching Pearl Harbor is like watching an infant bawling in its own dipers.This movie even became the highest grossing movies of all time.The full audience gave Pearl Harbor a  appause.The script is weak,but the attack sequences are great to watch.The ending is very shocking and good .Just don't watch this movie.I suggest you watch the trailer instead because its full of action.
B00005PJ8I|4.0|The theme of the cast away goes back long before Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) or The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss (1781-1830); indeed it probably goes back to a time when people first set out on the open sea in boats.  It is a wonderfully romantic genre, employing the classic \\"man versus nature\\" theme while allowing us to indulge in the fantasy of escape from the confines and restrictions of civilization.<br />Here we have Tom Hanks as Chuck Nolan, a Fed Ex executive whose plane ditches into the South Pacific ocean.  He washes up on a tiny, desert island as the sole survivor of the plane crash.  (Incidentally, both \\"des-ert island\\" and \\"de-serted island\\" are correct, the words \\"des-ert' and \\"de-serted\\" in this context meaning the same thing.)  His four-year stay on the island forms the bulk of the movie, but perhaps the most engaging part for most movie-goers is what happens afterwards.<br />Tom Hanks was excellent throughout, as usual, and the direction by Robert Zemeckis from a script by William Broyles Jr. was compelling.  Especially good was the irony about what happens to Chuck's beloved (Helen Hunt) while he is gone.  This has been done before (but I forget where), and is the kind of heart-wrenching development that could have been pure saccharin but instead came across as thought-provoking, veracious and very affecting.<br />Zemeckis also directed the excellent film, Contact (1997), made from the novel by Carl Sagan.  We can see here (and there) that Zemeckis's work owes a lot to the influence of Steven Spielberg in both a positive and a negative sense.  Zemeckis, like Spielberg, can be cloying at times in his effort to secure the audience's identification.  We can see this in the beginning with Chuck cutely trying to sell efficiency to the Russians with the help of a little boy.  But splendid was the plane crash sequence, the kind of thing Spielberg would want to be intensely vivid, and it was.  And later the startling sight of the huge cargo ship, like a sea-going skyscraper, recalled to mind the first shot of the spaceship from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).  The Fed Ex packages flying out all over the world engendering a kind of corporate \\"we're all one world\\" feeling like something from a Coca-Cola commercial was pure Spielberg.<br />But what I like to do when I look at a movie like this is to lean forward and scrutinize it for authenticity.  Did the cast away lose weight?  Yes, as a matter of fact, Tom Hanks must have dropped about ten pounds, or perhaps he fattened up for the first part of the film (or was that body cosmetology?) and then fasted for the scenes showing him four years later.  But did he lose enough weight?  For those who have been watching TV's \\"Survivor,\\" we know he didn't.  And was he tan enough?  His hair was little lighter after his ordeal, but he really needed to be baked a dark brown, which he wasn't.<br />I also look at how he ate.  What was his source of vitamin C?  Do coconuts contain Vitamin C?  I don't know.  But showing him eating seaweed, which does contain vitamin C, would have worked.  Using the coconuts to hold water was a nice touch.  Learning to spear fish with a wooden spear is plausible, but spearing a fish with a wooden spear in the open ocean is unlikely.  Notice there were no birds or bird eggs or bird guano on the island.  An uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean is always a nesting place for birds.<br />This last observation reveals that the setting was not in fact a tiny island but part of a larger body of land.  Notice there was no clear, encircling shot of the island (as from the air).  In fact we never see the other side of the island.<br />It was interesting to see how he got the fire going (again \\"Survivor\\" fans--and boy scouts--know how hard that is to do), but I was thinking that maybe he could have used the glass on the watch face or from the flashlight as a way to concentrate sunlight to make a fire.<br />I also watched to see whether he did what I would have done.  Of course what I would have done doesn't mean that much, but I would not have left the island for the open ocean (which seemed almost suicidal), unless there was out there on that ocean a ship's corridor, so to speak, which is possible.  Of course, who can say what a man might do after being four years entirely alone on a tiny island?  I also would not have tried to cure my toothache, regardless of how bad it hurt, by breaking the tooth off with the ice skates.  After all, that might make things worse.  Trying to pull the tooth would have been my strategy--but how?<br />I liked the irony of finding the ice skates in a washed up Fed Ex package, and then Chuck's use of the blades as mirror and  knife.  I know why he didn't take the dead man's clothes, but I think he should have plugged his nose and peeled them off anyway.  The washed up metal \\"sail\\" was a nice inspiration, and there were many others: the \\"discovery\\" of tool-making by striking the vocanic rock at the right angle; burning the base of the trees to make wood for the raft; the petroglyphs he made in the cave; sleeping on the floor in the hotel room, etc.<br />Best no comment scene: Chuck looking at the Alaskan king crab legs at the buffet.also watched to see whether he did what I would have done.

B00003CXB6|1.0|This movie is very disappointing.The script was very bad and the cast play stupid roles.Just skip this movie and go to Jurassic Park 3.
B000007T2Z|4.0|Explanations don't come easy for music such as this, neither for context, or emotion, and for the most part if you heard a section of this album, and not the whole thing, it probably would'nt make much sense, or get played again. However given the time, and given the chance GSYBE will take you somewhere, sometimes it's something that you did'nt want to feel, but hell, why else would people listen to something so beautifully sad. Life was'nt meant to be perfect, and if you believe that then this album is.
B00003CXB6|1.0|Jeff Goldblum returns and has to deal with more dino mendees when it turns out there is a secondary island containing the creatures.Too bad he has to deal with some greedy hunters too.Disappointing and slow at first this sequel loses all the entertainment value the original had with a cliched script filled with bad plans only to end with a ridiculous Godzilla-like rampage finale.Groanable gymnastics scene to.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad - What The Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That The Poor Do Not - By Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter.<br />I have read just about every book Robert Kiyosaki has put his name on, whether or not he wrote them is another story, but here is the review.<br />I actually think \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\", will forever be his best book. Unless he invents another rich dad, or a multi-level marketing uncle, I don't see how he can top \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\".<br />Many of his other books are knock-offs and adaptations of this masterpiece. I have read hundreds of critics of Roberts over the past year, and I know some of the critics are right in thier criticisms of Mr. Kiyosaki's not explaing the \\"How-To\\", but the fact remains, \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\", is simply a must for anyone with a pulse that is considering investing thier money.<br />Robert Kiyosaki never does tell anyone \\"How-To\\" do anything, but he is the master of getting an entire generation to review how they think of money, assets, and liabilities, and anyone just starting investments needs to begin, well, at the beggining!<br />I highly recommend this book, and several of his other works. You can look at all of my reviews to see the ones that I enjoyed the best. I do not particularly like his \\"Advisor Series\\" books, as they are not written in the same format and lack the storyline that the Rich Dad books encompass. That doesn't mean that they are not good books, but they do not compare to the original works of classic Kiyosaki.<br />One last note: Many reviewers of Kiyosaki's works are very brutal in thier perception of him as a person, and not on his work as an author. Robert Kiyosaki flunked high school english twice, and has had some unfortunate financial dealings in his past, but not due to criminal intent or a lack of morals. People also think he is focused way to much on money than is healthy. But once you read this book, you will see a genious behind his views and experiences. Mike, his childhood best friend had a father who set him up to be a multi millionaire, and probably a billionaire by now, whereas Robert has taken that experience, and used it as a tool to propel himself into the rich and famous the world over, after suffering several personal defeats.<br />You can read more reviews of Robert T. Kiyosaki's works here [WEBSITE]

B00005QIPH|2.0|Okay, enough of all the gushing about about these Velvet wannabes. The lead singer apes Lou Reed in a fairly convincing and listenable way, and the music, by mining the vaults of VU, television, Richard Hell, etc. (but mostly VU), ironically sounds refreshing compared to the overproduced nonsense dominating the music industry.  The problem is that the whole vibe is one of retro-styled idol worship (one wonders if they started out as a Velvet Underground tribute band...) rather than something original, unique, and relevant.  They sound like an imitation of their influences rather than a band that has found a way to forge their influences into something unique (such as the stones, stooges, Ramones, etc. etc. etc.).  I saw these guys on Saturday night recently and the drummer was wearing a Velvet Underground shirt...It seems like they are begging for the comparisons.  Some of the other reviews of this album, both positive and negative, mention that the songs tend to sound alike.  I agree with this assessment.  The thing that made the Velvet Underground brilliant was the diversity of their music, from lengthy experimental noise numbers to beautifully crafted pop songs to straight ahead rock and rollers, the music is consistently diverse and striking.  Not to mention Lou Reed's genius as a songwriter, from urgent street poetry about sexual experimentation and drug addiction to striking character portraits, to quiet introspection, his lyrics are vivid and unexpected.  The VU were a great rock and roll band, years ahead of their time, the music still sounds fresh and dangerous and stunning today.  The strokes sound like they've taken the more pop/radio friendly elements of the sound and given the music generic, unobtrusive, unthreatening, and unimpressive lyrics & delivery.  This album sounds better than a lot of the crap that's played on the radio, but that's not saying much.  Before I'd buy this, I'd invest in anything by the Velvets and go straight to the source ratherthan settling for a paint-by-the-numbers imitation.
B00005QZWI|5.0|There were several reasons why I purchased this soundtrack.  First of all, I am an inveterate Tolkien fan, and I truly enjoyed the movie, for all it deviated somewhat from the books.  Second, I truly enjoy Enya's music, so I thought I was purchasing the CD just for her two tracks.  Little did I know that *neither* of these are the reason you should get this soundtrack.<br />You should invest in this CD because Howard Shore did a *marvelous* job with the music.  So often, movie scores are very obviously \\"background music,\\" and lose their appeal when dissociated from the movie.  Not so with this effort.  This music stands exceptionally well on its own, and it is blessedly NON-thematic.  Yes, there are certain musical themes that recur in the soundtrack, but they serve more to tie the varied tracks together than to bore the listener with excessive repetition.<br />The scope of the score is magnificent with sounds that range from the hauntingly ethereal music associated with the Elvish cities of Imladris and Lothlorien, to the light-hearted, quick music of scurrying hobbit feet, to the driving, dark strains that accompany the marauding Nazgul, to the rhythmic, percussive sounds of Saruman's army of Uruk-hai.<br />Shore makes excellent use of an impressive orchestra and choir ensemble to take his score from the depths of hushed sorrow to the heights of thundering rage and heroism.  He's managed to capture the essence of Peter Jackson's interpretation of Middle Earth, in addition to producing a solid score in its own right.<br />As I expected, Enya's additions to the soundtrack are wonderful.  Her voice is perfectly suited to Tolkien's Sindarin and Quenya dialects of the Elvish language.  The lyrics to \\"May It Be\\" (which you can download free from Amazon) are particularly poignant - I highly suggest looking them up if you haven't already.<br />I love all the tracks on the album for different reasons, but the one that stuck with me the most is a thirty-second bit at the end of \\"The Bridge of Khazad Dum.\\"  Those who have seen the movie will recognize it immediately, and it had me in tears, even *without* the benefit of the wrenching scene from the film.<br />Powerful stuff from Howard Shore and Enya; I can't wait for the next two to come out!  This CD is highly recommended.  You won't be disappointed!
6304083769|2.0|The first half of this was so boring I nearly turned it off -- no real science fiction, just one scene after another of gunfire and profanity with no visual impact or dramatic tension. The second half was a little better, once it started dealing with the science fiction aspects, but then it got bogged down in a confusing plot, obvious exposition, and heavy-handed philosophy that still lacked dramatic tension.  Action without humor, nudity that didn't manage to be artistic OR sexy, characters that gave you no reason to care about them -- not even as eye candy.  If you want an action anime OR one exploring the cyborg/human question, you'd be better off with Armitage III.
B000002H97|2.0|Trashers out there would abhore this slomp effort of Metallica. And I, for myself, would prefer Megadeth--for having release the incomparable \\"Rust In Peace\\" a year earlier. This album is not trash metal that's for sure. There are good songs here. Classics as some might even claim...but just buried beneath  frustrated expectations. For starters, stick with the first four essential Metallica albums.

That is a great album, but &quot;Homogenic&quot; is my favorite.  &quot;Joga&quot; is a gorgeous mix of orchestra and deep, dark beats.  &quot;Bachelorette&quot; is also wonderful.  I love the the heaviness of these songs-very textured and thought-provoking.  Essential.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The Elephant Man, released in 1980, is a remarkable film.  It is the true story of Englishman John Merrick, who was born with a rare disease that has left him horribly disfigured.  He is exploited by a sideshow circus owner until he is rescued by Treves, a physician from the London Hospital, who wishes to study his case.  But as Treves gets to know Merrick, he realizes that underneath the hideous visage lies a gentle, loving soul.  But just as Merrick finds contentment, he is kidnapped by the sideshow owner, who feels that he has been cheated by the doctor.<br />John Merrick is played by an unrecognizable John Hurt, who gives an incredible performance underneath all that make up.  Merrick's rescuer, Dr. Treves, is played to near perfection by Anthony Hopkins.  Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, and Wendy Hiller play minor roles.<br />The Elephant Man was shot on high-quality black and white film, which adds to the Victorian Era atmosphere, and makes the deformed face of John Merrick much more interesting than color would have.  This was David Lynch's second major directorial effort, and it remains one of his best films.  And, quite shockingly, the film's executive producer was none other than Mel Brooks. But Brooks left his name off the credits so that filmgoers wouldn't misconstrue The Elephant Man as a comedy.  The only mention of Brooks's name is found in the production company, Brooksfilms.<br />The film received 8 Academy Award nominations, although it didn't win any Oscars.  But the creation of the make-up for the John Merrick character did begin the process for the Academy adding a new award category for Best Make Up for future years.<br />Although the film is ultimately a tragedy, The Elephant Man is a film about kindness, dignity, and love.  One cannot help but be moved by this wonderful, powerful motion picture.
0688145078|5.0|I have been looking some time now for a book for my son that tells him about having a new baby.  I really like how this book tells what all a new baby can't do yet (ex. new babies can't talk, walk, play with toys yet, and can't eat pizza or ice cream).  Then the book goes on to tell what babies can do (ex. Babies like to drink milk, stay warm and cozy, and best of all the baby loves to look at me because I'm the big brother!).  The book makes the brother of the baby feel special because the book explains to them that they are a big boy and a new brother.  It lets them know that they can help mommy and daddy with the baby!  My son is only 2 1/2 but loves this book more than I thought he would.  He now talks about can't waiting for his new baby to get here.  Now He tells everyone that he is a big brother, my little guy is just so proud of this!  This is a very well writen book, easy to understand even for a 2 year old.  As a new mom to be I also love this book, it helps explain things that I wasn't sure how to.
B00005JKJA|5.0|...>This is both the most beautiful and most harrowing film I have ever seen.  This is the best film I have ever seen.  If you open yourself up to it as if it were a painting or a piece of music, it gets inside you and doesn&#8217;t leave.  I saw it more than 6 months ago and it&#8217;s still in me.  I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on this DVD.  Both to exorcise some of the residue this movie has left me with and to absorb some things I didn&#8217;t allow the last time around.  ... I&#8217;m almost drooling here.  Gimme.  Gimme.
B0000035E7|5.0|The more I listened to this album the more I liked it.  By far and away, it's now my favorite Nirvana album.  It may have been made for $600, but the feelings & impressions conveyed are priceless.  Nevermind is great, but for me, the raw & unadulterated power of these songs is incomparable.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I'm surprised by some of the negative comments from other reviewers about this movie being nothing more than a cute idea.  Quite the contrary, I think this movie is one of the most unnerving and fascinating ones I've ever seen (which is saying a lot, as I like challenging movies).<br />The movie does take some effort to follow, but it's definitely well worth the investment.  There are many twists and turns along the way, including a few that I'm sure no one will see coming, coupled with some outstanding performances.
0843111259|5.0|Mr. Sneeze just keeps giving and giving.  This book is amazing; our daughter has heard it over and over and still wants more.  It is the perfect length, not too long, not too short (she never looses interest).  I would definitely recommend this to everyone who has kids.
B00005ARDC|5.0|This album is absolutely killer.  It IS a bit of a grower...if I wrote this upon first listen, I may have given it 4 stars, or maybe even 3.  However, after repeated spins (perhaps 5 or 6), I noticed things that hadn't been apparent upon first listen.  It's hard to explain.  Without sounding flaky, this band seems to encompass the spirit of rock 'n' roll.  Whatever that means.  Buy it if you like screaming fuzz-tones and bombastic drums and bass.  Or if you want to annoy that idiot neighbour next door who is always pumping stupid rap songs.
B000002I7R|5.0|Please dont listen to these guys, buy Principle of Moments too.  Some people are so serious.

B00000255X|4.0|From the surrealistic paranoia of Highway 61 Revisited to the solemn introspection of Blood On the Tracks, Bob Dylan&#8217;s albums as a whole have always had a certain feel or tone. That is why Desire is such an odd duck in the master songwriter&#8217;s catalogue. On this 1976 LP, Mr. Dylan journeys all across the musical, lyrical and cultural maps. Desire opens with the fast-paced, socially conscious opus, &#8220;Hurricane&#8221; and ends with the somber, personal account, &#8220;Sara.&#8221; In between are many valleys and peaks and some of the most varied material of Mr. Dylan&#8217;s career. Like &#8220;Don&#8217;t Think Twice It&#8217;s Alright&#8221; or &#8220;It Ain&#8217;t Me Babe,&#8221; &#8220;One More Cup of Coffee&#8221; shows Mr. Dylan&#8217;s cunning spitefulness at its best while the following track &#8220;Oh, Sister&#8221; is the artist at his most sentimental. &#8220;Isis,&#8221; is a rough-rocking rambler a la &#8220;Tangled Up in Blue,&#8221; set in country backwaters while &#8220;Joey&#8221; is a mournful tribute to gangster, Joey Gallo, caked in the grime and ruination of the urban crime. Mr. Dylan even takes turns as unexpected as working with a violinist (Scarlet Rivera) and a cowriter (Jacques Levy).<br />Its lack of direction may have been Desire&#8217;s downfall if not for the fact that the songs, evaluated on their own merits, are generally superb. There are only two moments where Mr. Dylan&#8217;s experimentation goes amiss: &#8220;Mozambique,&#8221; which features lyrics that read like a travel brochure and &#8220;Romance in Durango,&#8221; which has an almost stereotypically South American flavor. But while zigging and zagging across Desire, Mr. Dylan, for the most part, maintains the gorgeous melodies, sharp wit and magnificent story telling we have come to expect from him. Some of these songs, such as &#8220;Hurricane,&#8221; &#8220;Isis&#8221; and &#8220;Sara,&#8221; even have the right to be called classics. The many instances in which the experimentation of the eclectic Desire fly are undoubtably worth the price of the few that flutter.
6302206294|5.0|Where this film succeeds is in the characters. The actors are all well-chosen for the leading and supporting roles. Nick Brimble is a gentle giant Little John, but is less thigh-slapping than earlier versions, and seems at times quite menacing. Micheal McShane is delightful as Friar Tuck and a variety of British and American character actors in lesser roles.<br />There are a couple of historical errors. The Merry men are seen to use the crossbow, the weapon of the French, whereas the English would have used the longbow. I cannot see why the film-makers could have got this wrong since almost every cinematic and televisual representation of the Outlaws shows longbows being used. The other big clanger is the location shooting, which has Robin and his chum (Morgan Freeman's inscrutable Azeem) walking the length of England in a couple of hours (from the White Cliffs of Dover to Hadrian's Wall). Again, this is baffling, when you see the care put into other areas of the film.<br />History aside, this is a great adventure, with Kevin Costner applying himself well in a difficult role, and the story of how Robin assembles his band being told with aplomb. There are well-choreographed fight sequences, superb villains in Alan Rickman and Geraldine McEwen, and a climactic ending. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the longest running U.K. Number One single, Everything I Do (I Do It For You) by Bryan Adams is taken from the soundtrack.
B00005QIPH|5.0|just buy it or regret will ruin you.
0553277472|5.0|As to the hinting around mentioned in another review, I can stop that. This book DID change my life. I was headed for a business career in which little if any philosophical discussion would be had. After reading ZEN, I went to college and graduated in philosophy, and am now headed to law school to study ethical political theories. All the &quot;sappiness&quot; of the tale about Chris only made the story readable for me. It did not bore or disgust me. It made the tough-to-chew metaphysics easier to understand and digest. I certainly allow that one not interested in metaphysical concepts would probably not enjoy ZEN, but no one can deny that ZEN has had noticable impact on the lives of many others -- particularly those who reread it. Enjoy!
B00005YTFG|1.0|this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my whole entire life! It dragged on and on! The best part was when it was over! There a few good parts but not good enough to even rent the movie! It was so stupid and corny everyone was dancing around and singing and in a way it's kind of scary with all the wierd props and actors with wierd make-up! I thought it would be more!
B00000ILDE|3.0|Despite being the best transfer of this film, the picture is still very grainy at times. Sound is not very good and Special Features are lacking too. There is no director's commentary and only a short collection of scenes w/o audio misleadingly dubbed \\"Behind the scenes\\". An old interview with Cameron is included, however it's still no substitue for a full-length commentary. Not to mention the crappy case. This movie deserves better. At [price] this DVD is seriously overpriced....<BR>This is what \\"Aliens - Collector's Edition\\" should contain:<br />- New anamorphic transfer.<BR>- DTS soundtrack<BR>- Commentary by James Cameron, Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton.<BR>- \\"Making of\\" documentary
B00000DGUG|5.0|I love this woman as well as this album.  The music on this cd is very appealing in my opinion.  Her lyrics are very uplifting and touching in a physical and spiritual sense.  I like all the songs on the cd, my favorites are Baba, Sympathetic Character, Would Not Come and That I Would Be Good.  I think this is a cd for any music lover.
B00005O5CM|2.0|Seemes an utter waste of talent. Reese Witherspoon and Selma Blair were the best part of the highly uneven CRUEL INTENTIONS. Seeing them back together should have been a delight. But in this movie the first plays just plain stupid and the second a jealous, not too likeable character portrayed too positively. But the main reason I felt legally conned by this is how it sells itself as light comedy. That lured me in for an easygoing two hours of movie, but that ain't what I got. I wasn't in the mood for heavy-handed delvings into cutthroat competition and sexual harrassment. And Blair's character was away too insensitive with the title character's plight with both to be the sort-of heroic character she's ultimate portrayed as. There's at least one character in the movie considerably less unlikeable than Blair's but mercilessly trashed in the end.
031219126X|4.0|I believe that people think of Frankenstein as being a horrible monster that tormented towns and people with bolts coming out of his neck.  Even I had fallen under these mis-conceptions from watching the old b&amp;w movies on TV as a small child.  The movies we watched set us up for that, but after reading the book by Mary Shelley, I was surprised to learn and see things differently.  Mary wrote a classic horror story that even though moves at a slow pace for our time (story originally written in the 1800's) still can scare the reader.  Were told what we need to know about key characters in the book, but other descriptions such as the what the monster truly looks like are left out.  We are allowed to imagine that and because of this, allowed to use what scares us the most in this world to scare ourselves.  Even the theme and plot that runs through the book could be looked at, as political or social issues that still plague the world today.  When all is said and done, the book Frankenstein is a great book that should be read be everyone that enjoys not only horror books, but also romantic classics.
B00005QIPH|3.0|At first listen this sounds pretty exciting, but after a few times through their influences begin to weigh in rather heavily. The two-guitar attack is very reminiscent of Tom Verlaine and Richard Lloyd's work with Television, which is not a bad thing, but it's been done.  The vocals are a very astute combination of Iggy Stooge and Richard Hell.<br />The songs tend to get samey, but I think this is a result of the production, which is calculatedly \\"raw.\\"  A touch of reverb wouldn't have hurt, guys.  The \\"singing through a megaphone\\" effect that they stick on Julian Casablancas' vocals doesn't help either.  The production, basically, is really deadening to the ear, which detracts from the songs.  This is too bad, because the songs are (mostly) quite strong and the lyrics bear listening to several times.  The guitar work, despite being derivative, is right on the money throughout.<br />I wish I liked these guys more than I do.  They have the right attitude and the right moves, and I suspect they may even have their hearts in the right place, but there's an aura of calculatedness that throws me off, and the production is really not all that good.<br />If they survive the hype, the Strokes may develop into a great band; the seeds are certainly here.  If they don't \\"Inside The Music\\" themselves out of commission with hype, drugs, groupies and what-not, they will put out a determinedly great CD.  This isn't it, but it's worth hearing.
B00005JKMO|5.0|This is was GREAT movie!  As a matter of fact it was the best movie I've seen in a while.  I love the way the movie gives a more personal view of Malcolm X.  I feel that Will Smith did a wonderful job.  I'm ready for this movie to come out on vhs so I can own it!!!!!!!
B000002MM8|5.0|The haunting and soothing vocal of &quot;Yulunga&quot; has calmed my fractured nerves on more than one occaision.  &quot;Tell Me About The Forest -- you once called home&quot; is one of the songs that grows on you. If you have never listened to any Dead Can Dance CDs, then let this CD be your first purchase.
B00003CY5J|1.0|What an unpleasant surprise ... as a rabid deNiro fan I was expecting another 'Heat' film with De Niro, Al Pacino and Val Kilmer .... WRONG ... <br />This movie comes nowhere close to the quality entertainment that we have come to expect. Although De Niros role as super thief surrounded by 'you better do everything I tell you, or the gig is off' partners in crime is well depicted, but, that is about it as far as this film is concerned. <br />There is no character development here, the story sucks and I bet DeNiro would probably want to forget about this film and pull it from the shelves if he could ....<br />What a dog .. save your money
B00005QDW1|1.0|I've been a No Doubt fan from the very begining.  They are an extremely original and talented band.  One of the best out there today.....until Rock Steady. i heard this and said huh? For the new sound that they promised us is nothing new after all.  It's been done.  No Doubt is well known for reinventing themselves and having a unique sound.  They have turned into a cliche and so has their music.  As a musician and a No Doubt fan, this album is very disappointing.  If you're looking for a good hip hop/dance/party album then check it out.  If you're a No Doubt fan, you may want to pick it up to add to your collection but don't expect the talented, quirky,good, grab ya where ya live kind of music that you have come to know.<br />This is just one person's opinion.  Check it out.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|How can anyone put Nicola Cage, Robert Duvall and Angelie Jolie in one film and make it boring? Well they certainly accoplished that here and I think the writers and the director had to work on it ... real hard .... <br />Most of the people in this movie are not only unlikeable but real stupid too .. and I mean dumb dumb dumb ... Give me a break, steal 50 specific model luxury cars in 4 days (actually like 24 hours) deliver them to the same pier for delivery to that Latin buyer while the car theft divion of LAPD is not only wise to your gig but sets up stake outs. <br />To make matters even stupider than dumb they put the cars into containers right on the dock in from of like 100's of longshoremen ... I mean the cars aren't even featured in this film except as passing references .... <br />This is one dumb dumb dumb flick ....
0375703861|5.0|The negative reactions to this book made me think about why I love it.  It may seem scattered, and random, with the ending being completely dependent on coincidence.  But how different is that from real life?  This book looks at its characters from the outside inwards, whereas we see our lives from a very narrow viewpoint, one that we define, and from the inside outwards -- that's the advantage of an omniscient narrator.  There are many coincidences in life that we simply don't acknowledge -- think about all the stories of people of people who went to the same high school without knowing each other, then end up marrying ten years later.  Even in a globalized era, our paths may appear random at the level of the individual, but the macrocosm manages to relate us all.  I think the tendency for us is to assume that there is no master plan, when in fact there might be one.  At that point, like Marcus Chalfen, we try to impose our own order on the world.  And, like Marcus, we find that doesn't work.<br />Another complaint I have problems with is the idea that the early characters fade towards the end of the novel.  Again, how different is that from reality?  Mangal Pande's shadow looms over Samad, but, effectively, the legacy is one of the major reasons Samad is never happy -- he's always in a competition with a dead guy!  Samad himself has to fade for his sons to emerge.  But that fading is never complete, as we see with Mr. JP Hamilton.  He has a history almost completely irrelevant to Irie, Magid, and Millat, but that doesn't make his irrelevance any less tragic.  We all have to overcome legacies left to us by our forebears, but annihilation of memory is never complete (or necessary.)<br />One problem I think people hasn't been mentioned is the prevalence of \\"in\\" jokes.  I'm sure that many of the things that I find funny made no sense to a lot of people, but that says something about the relationship between sub-cultures and the wider identity of a nation.  Like otherreaders, I was impressed with how many topics Smith was able to tackle at an intelligent level (and she's only three years older than me!) <br />Finally, my favorite parts of the novel is the characters.  Every character is absurd, but no more absurd than real people.  Archie's life revolves around a coin, Clara is a lapsed Jehovah's Witness whose ex-boyfriend is trying to lure her back to the religion she showed him, Samad struggles to confom to a religion he hates, Magid and Millat are a twin study for the ages, and Alsana should give pause to anyone who still believes that Muslim women are inherently oppressed.  But, hey, aren't we all just a little whacked?  We all have contradictions of character that make us just a little more imperfect or a little more human.  This book captures that, but it manages not to get weighed down by the material it tackles.
B00000JRTX|4.0|...just be sure to hit the right ramp.  This movie is a blast, not least because it has no big soundtrack.  Hugh Grant is just a pretty boy, but this is right in his range, and no one can beat him there.  The gossip scene at one of the receptions is one of those I like to watch over and over.  Andie M is remarkable and seductive.  This movie breaks and mends hearts.  One of the few times I've liked a movie recommended by someone at work.  No chase scenes, just quiet comedy that will cut you up.  Buy it, I'm not messin' with you.  ....
B000002BE9|5.0|There are two different states that a pop music listener can be in: Before Hearing Fiona Apple and After Hearing Fiona Apple.  BHFA, the best album of the 90's is Radiohead- OK Computer.  AHFA, the best album of the 90's is When the Pawn...  One thing that's true about AHFA is that while in that state, you learn to expect consistency with Fiona Apple.  Both Tidal and When the Pawn are dud-free, but Tidal is ultimately the weaker of the two (cut her some slack though; she wrote soem of the songs when she was just 14). Tidal is sort of wispy and if you don't listen very closely, it sort of all drowns together like watercolor, especially during the latter part of the album.  The songs are very sad already, exploring dark topics like rape (sullen girl) lust gone bad (pale september) a relationship that's like a dead animal carcass (carrion) and the longing to be noticed and simultaneously treated with respect by boys (sleep to dream, never is a promise).  Perhaps it's the very sorry choice in instrumentation (vibes, chamberlain) that occurs in the background that lends this album it's superfluous melancholy.  Tidal ain't a rockin' record, even on songs that should rock (like Criminal, which is a very dark and unsettling song when maybe it could have benefitted from some sunniness).  And right there my criticisms of Tidal end.  <br />Most people who like Tidal better than WTP point out that it has more songwriting high points.  Indeed it does.  Never Is A Promise is simply a song that has the power to bring one to tears.  Fiona tells someone she loves that he'll never understand the \\"heat of her soul\\" with heartbreaking sadness, and her voice goes into a soprano as if the passion of her words simply could not contain themselves in her usual alto- while, the strings soar, and the piano work is simply astonishing in its sheer prodigious complexity.  Never Is A Promise is also very much a pop song, a weepy, but still a pop song and it's a wonder why it was never released asa single or promoted as heavily as it should have been.  Another songwriting high point is Shadowboxer- a song that lacks the highly depressing element that is present during the rest of the album.  It is hands down the song that should have become famous instead of Criminal.  It is a torch-ballad with the atmosphere of a nightclub; she even sings a bit off-key with endearing results.  Simple structurally compared with the rest of her tunes, but extraordinary in its power to make one feel the emotion of Apple's obsession with whom ever she's singing to, no song on either Tidal or WTP is more indicative of her power as a songwriter of hits than Shadowboxer.<br />Essentialy what is at the heart of Fiona Apple is a longing for people to understand her.  She knows she's largely misunderstood and so she invites us to take a look at her life, discover the pain, and ultimately empathize.  BHFA might call her pretentious.  I think that there's never been a record more full of heart and less full of pretention.  And although WTP has the benefit of Jon Brion, and Fiona Apple as a matured person and artist, and though Tidal has the benefit of 4 great pop songs: Criminal, Shadowboxer, Never Is A Promise, and Sullen Girl, I think that both albums are more than worthy to take a place on any record shelf.  If you are thinking about buying this, I would strongly suggest going for it.  I persuaded a friend of mine who I know is into good alternative music to buy it and she is very pleased with the album.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Rented this movie over the weekend.  I really wasn't interested in seeing it.  However, It was my wife's night to choose.  This  movie was great!  I've never seen such a strange and entertaining mix of modern music, period costumes, outrageous performances (John Leguizamo was hillarious ad Tolouse Letrec!) and rapid fire editing.  <br />Overall the film was like grabbing the leash of a very big dog that decides to take you for a run.   All you can do is hang on for the ride.  <br />We rented it this weekend, but I'm definately going to buy it today.
0201633612|5.0|Good programmers should know about Patterns and this is the best book on the subject for those familiar with C++.
B000050FEN|4.0|Seven is a great a film. It is a great screenplay, briliantly acted and expertly directed. Another aspect that made this a great film is  the \\"look\\" of the film.  The film was dark, colors were dull and gray--it gave the the viewer the feeling of impending evil and doom.  The visual style was perfect for the story.  Every scene looked pale & frightening.<br />The platinum series DVD remastered the orginal film print. The second DVD ( full of extras)actualy shows you how they purposely changed the film. The picture quality is crisp and clear  which is a good thing.  But the colors of the film were made brighter!!!  The dull colors which signified death and decay in the original movie are replaced by brilliant illuminous colors  that canote life & happiness.  <br />When i first saw the film--the movie was genuinely creepy and disturbing--but this DVD eliminates the visual creepiness of the film and replaces it with standard colors and a standard look.<br />The director, David Fincher, SOLD OUT.  He replaced the color of th print to make it look prettier and make the DVD more commercial.  He fails to see that what made this film such a classic was its refusal to follow standard hollywood rules about film making.
0002171856|4.0|This book is one of four indispensable basic, general texts on the subject of survival that anyone interested in the subject should have for reference.  The others are Janowsky and Janowsky, the US Army FM 21-76, US Air Force Reg 64-4. My version is the 1986 Survive Safely Anywhere: The SAS Survival Manual.  The most important characteristic of a really useful book on this subject is not just the kind and quantity of information available, but the real usefulness and authenticity of the information.  Wiseman's book has that, and it's greatest asset beyond that sine qua non is the generally excellent quality of illustration.  It covers much of the same ground as other texts, expands nicely on some areas, and has some discussion that is generally not discussed in other books.  It has quite a bit in the areas of camp craft/improvised equipment, plants, first aid,  and natural disasters.  The bit on vehicle operation is not the same old information, and benefits from military experience such as that of SAS Mobility Troop. This book, with the other three, is a superb general reference and a starting point for further investigations for those interested in the subject.
0449002632|5.0|Excellent book.  Yes, you can probably guess many of the elements (corrupt clergy, greedy merchants, whoremongering, capital punishment, plague, filth - what a great time to be alive!).  But the chapters (each of which are separate stories, tracing family members through the centuries) are very skillfully crafted.  I also enjoyed the way the author incorporated major historical events into the fiction.  While some history buffs may scoff at mixing history with fictional characters, I thought the author did a great job of delineating between the two. <br />One caveat, however.  The author weaves many landmarks and names from modern-day London into the plots, thereby explaining their historical origins.  If you are not familiar with the city, these references could become annoying background noise.  But if you have been to London, these tidbits add a great deal to the enjoyment of the work.
B00000I2UE|4.0|A lot lighter than Psychocandy, this second album was a great change of pace. Jesus and Mary Chain are cult heroes for several reasons,and Darklands is one of them.
0345451325|5.0|It took me about a month to read Halo:The Fall of Reach and for most books, I always complain about how i dont uderstand what is going on it the book, well this book is the only book that I understanded fully. When I was reading it in school, it was so hard to put it down because it was so intense. I personaly beat Halo in about a month and a half and after I read this book, I understanded the game so much better.
078322608X|5.0|I'm fond of dystopia movies, and 12 Monkeys paints a good picture of one.  Before this movie, I wasn't much of a fan of Brad Pitt as an actor, but his performance in this really won me over, and I stopped thinking he was just a pretty face.
B00005RYQO|5.0|This movie is about an undercover cop Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) who gets into the world of street racing by meeting Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel).  In Dominic gang there is his girlfriend Lenny (Michelle Roridriguz)and his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster who is hella hot) and his buddies Leon, Vince and Jessie.  Brian then has to find out who is stealing from truckers with out blowing his cover.  This movie is tight but the car are tighter!  If you havent seen it you should.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Rusell Crowe comes back with an outstanding performance that brings back to mind his role in Michael Mann's \\"The Insider,\\" where he played the role of a former executive from a tobacco company that becomes persecuted by the company because how much he knew. This time around, he plays the role of mathematician John Nash, a brilliant mind who stands out of the rest of his peers while he attended Princeton. This put him in a position where he was bound to be involved with the Department of Defense in Top Secret operations, as \\"the world's best natural code-braker.\\" However his mind plays games with him and drives him down a cliff of paranoia, ending up diagnosed with schizophrenia. His trip back from this problem with the help of his loving wife Alicia (played by beautiful Jennifer Connelly -\\"Requiem for a Dream\\") takes a central place in the movie, until he learns to live with the visions of his past that surround him while he gets in touch once again with what's real in life...<br />A movie with a beautiful message of what's possible with the help of love and determination. See it. You will like it.
B000001FTD|5.0|AMONG THE LIVING is a thrash masterpiece that shows ANTHRAX improving from STD. This disc has at least 5 classic metal songs that every metal-head should love, AMONG THE LIVING, CAUGHT IN A MOSH, I AM THE LAW, EFILNIKUFESIN(N.F.L) and INDIANS. SKELETON IN THE CLOSET is a very heavy powerful song as well as ONE WORLD. ANTHRAX has always been able to mix serious music with some comical messages and on this album. LAW is based on the Judge Dredd comic book character while INDIANS deals with the treatment of the Native Americans throughout this nations history. ANTHRAX might not have been as comercially sucessful as METALLICA, MEGADETH OR SLAYER, but musically, their talent cannot be denied. I highly recommend this album for metal fans
B00005U8EM|5.0|There can be no surprise that this movie continues to be a success many years after its original production. It works on so many levels. The comedy and the love story speak for themselves and are superbly realised by the actors.<br />The fascinating thing for me is that it explores a world where there are no consequences for one's actions. You can rob a bank with millisecond-timing &amp; no-one will know you have done it. You can trick a girl into believing you are an old school pal. You can be slammed in jail and wake up the next morning cosy in your own bed. But we see through the movie that the ultimate outcome of this is not pleasure or gain, but misery.<br />The other beguiling lesson for me - or for any of us - is Phil's tranformation. How is this achieved? Simple: by being nice to people. By such simple acts as buying a coffee and a doughnut for your co-workers when they are not expecting it. By being unselfish and not always calculating the gain to oneself.<br />Well done to Harold Ramis and all who contributed. Much recommended.
B000001FFR|5.0|SPREADING THE DISEASE is an awesome album that features Joey Belladonna singing on an ANTHRAX album for the first time. I like the Belladonna-era ANTHRAX alot, havent really given the new lineup a listen, but anyways. This ablum is full of great riffs, blazing energy and great songs. A.I.R., LONE JUSTICE, MADHOUSE are heavy powerful songs. While S.S.C/STAND OR FALL, GUNG-HO, and AFTESHOCK are just pure slabs of fast thrash music at the best. I like how the song ARMED AND DANGEROUS starts off with a slow melody to it and builds power as it goes along. One more thing, dont pass up listening to MEDUSA it is also a killer song.
B000002GAF|5.0|This album was my first introduction to Gino Vannelli and have been a fan for many years.  If you don't own any other albums by Gino, this is a must have!
B000001FSU|5.0|I was glad that I was able to find this CD and buy it, I had the cassette years ago, but wore the hell out of it. STATE OF EUPHORIA is metal classic that stands up there with anything released by METALLICA, MEGADETH OR SLAYER in the same time period. All these bands released albums the same years as this one, and ANTHRAX sometimes doesnt get the due they are owed. This album is filled with great lyrics, killer riffs and alot of energy. ANTHRAX has always been able to mix serious messages with some comical lyrics on their albums and they do here once again. BE ALL,END ALL, MAKE ME LAUGH, WHO CARES WINS are 3 songs that are serious but they just rock, FINALE is a funny song that with comical lyrics that also rocks. ANTISOCIAL is also a classic song that the band rocks out on. If you like fast furious music, then this is an album that u should own.
B00000064G|4.0|This is one of those things you catch wind about and pick up at the store out of curiosity, wondering what it's going to contain.  You're almost sure to find something special about this one, though.  The first time i listened was probably a rainy day, and it's peaceful quiet is soothing.  Yet when looking at the lyrics, we see that Nick Drake was anything but peaceful and happy.  Still, he somehow managed to take all of his inner turmoil and create something absolutely magnificent and unique, which is one of the crazy things about genius.  <BR>The guitar playing is reminiscent of classical runs, like a folk Mozart combination.  Drake's voice is light and unpretentious; quiet and naked.  The album's stripped down recording only adds to it's ambience, because you get to see the songs as they really are, a theory i dearly wish other artists would try.  There's nothing about this album that lies, it is only a man and his songs, and it can only be that.  Don't worry about classification, or about what music you already like, because this album will strike you the first time you hear it.  It's music that has no limit.
0140288503|5.0|The story of a relatively small but deadly firefight brings to light USA's failed foreign policy regarding Africa's Somalia.   Bowden's powerful description of the battle in Mogadishu over one 24 hour period is as captivating a story as I have read in years.  Bowden tells his battle story from the viewpoints of its participants from the general down to the private. America's modernized military might was tested and it won, or did it.  <BR> <BR>I applaud Bowden's efforts, his book is excellently researched and heart rendering.  He captured both the people and the events so vividly that when you read this story you can visualize the fire-fights, the wounded, and the horror.  The fateful decisions made by the General Garrison will be assessed later by historians but Bowden leaves the success of the mission up to us to decide.<br />Since the book is labeled Military History I would like to point out that it is not strictly a text-book history.  Bowden's work breathes life into his soldiers.  This is no dry history, you hear the soldiers speak and behave as men (or as boys, as the case may be) during the attack.  This is probably one of the best facets of his book, it reads like a novel.<br />This battle will be analyzed by historians 25 - 50 years from now and they can apply the true historical impact of this attack.  Bowden makes no claim to be a historian and even shies away from assessing blame (which historians usually have no problem doing).  Bowden's  perspective is that of a journalist, a viewer of events and he makes no historical analysis but recounts the activities before, during and after October 3rd, 1993. He offers us an impartial view of this battle and for this he should be congratulated.  Faced with the number of dead and wounded USA soldiers I think it must have been tough to stand on the sidelines.<br />This is excellent book.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin at their best were immensely powerful, creative, and sexual.  The BBC reflects them in all of their glory: colorful guitar spins and flurries, the driving force of bass and drums, the heavy grooves, and of course Robert Plant and his loud and demanding vocals.  Thankfully, on this disc we catch Led Zeppelin at a time before the guitar solo's became 15 minutes too long, and we find that Led Zeppelin could be as amazing and driving and raw as any band to come.  <BR>To see how Dazed and Confused translates during different sessions is a treat (you can never get tired of that solo section), and to hear the band with a minimum of overdubs is even more rare.  Just listen and enjoy where four people can take music, you might find yourself being totally caught off balance by the deep spiritual journey that happens in a Led Zeppelin performance.
0066620996|4.0|Trust Jim Collins to make a management book that is both engaging and logical. Good To Great's elegant simplicity belies the huge amounts of research and interviews that went into it.<br />The book espouses the classic &quot;find the right people&quot;, &quot;ready for change&quot; and &quot;steady wins the race&quot; virtues for making a business empire. The book also expressed typical distaste for corporate extravagance, marketing hyperbole and superstar executives. Granted, there is nothing new or radical here.<br />Sometimes I find the management terms here grating. The &quot;flywheel&quot; idea and the &quot;hedgehog and fox&quot; concept sounds downright silly to me, although the underlying principles are insightful. Also, I am not too comfortable with Collins' use of comparison companies. According to the book, the companies that did not apply the fundamental principles are doomed to absolute failure. <br />Good book overall. Nothing groundbreaking, but fun to read.
B00005RG6B|4.0|This DVD is excellent,but if I could only have it, or the VHS version, the VHS would win. I find that they VHS sound is superior to the sound of the DVD (using Dolby Digital 5.1) and that is a big disappointment to me. It is also a different performance altogether, and regardless of the sound quality, I also prefer the VHS performance. I don't regret getting the DVD and like it very much; just not as much as the VHS release...
B00005T30L|4.0|\\"Ghost World\\" ranks as the best reviewed film that is based on the old Hollywood debacle, the comic book. However, Daniel Clowes' original \\"Ghost World\\" graphic novel is rated as one of the best stand alone 'funnybooks' ever, perfectly capturing the malaise and melancholy inherent in all teenagers via his two protagonists, Enid and Rebecca. Terry Zwigoff, with the help of a script co-written by Clowes and himself, perfectly captures this said tone, by delivering a movie that has almost everything a good movie does; by turns funny and sad, uplifting and tragic, this ranks as one of the better films of 2001 easily.<br />The reason \\"Ghost World\\" didn't break out as well as it should have done at the cinemas (God knows it is a hell of a lot sharper, wittier and funnier than the likes of \\"American Pie 2\\") was probably due to its misleadingly cheery ad campaign (which peculiarly gives Brad Renfro's extended cameo third billing) and its prominent display of beautiful teen stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson on the poster. Whilst Birch admittedly looks a lot worse than when she burst back onto the scene in \\"American Beauty\\", \\"Ghost World\\" isn't a teen movie in the sense that \\"She's All That\\" is a teen movie. 1) It is a hell of a lot more true to life than Hollywood would like to put money into a movie for, with an ambiguous, sarcastic tone inherent with movies like \\"Fight Club\\" though it admirably doesn't spend $70 million getting its point across; 2) its characters aren't clear-cut, black-and-white good guys and bad guys, but stupid, deluded creatures trying to sift their way through life like the rest of us; 3) it isn't exactly a hip, contemporary movie, its score taking a leaf out of Carter Burwell's score for \\"Being John Malkovich\\" and having its teenage heroine listen to Bollywood and old-time blues tunes.<br />All of that said, now the audience knows what they are going in for, they can appreciate \\"Ghost World\\" for what it is; a film so evilly funny and criticalof popular culture it hurts and a moving character study of several people, who can be seen as 'ghosts', trying to get a sense of direction in their lives. Birch's Enid is given the most screentime, dying her hair and wearing varied colour-coded outfits to try and gain a cohesive identity of herself as her friends begin to move away from her to supposedly bigger things; and being given this meaty role, she greatly devours it. Equally affecting, however, are Johansson and Steve Buscemi as her equally distant friends; Johansson's moving performance takes a couple of viewings to sink in whilst Buscemi's loser who's life is suddenly ignited by Enid is a performance of acute subtlety; an Oscar nomination please! All the while, the melancholy is undercut with these three characters making fun of the hypocrisy, whitewashing and everything else society does in the name of commerce and pleasure. You start off not feeling for these guys but, come journey's end, they'll stay with you always.<br />\\"Ghost World\\", fundamentally, is a love-it-hate-it film, with little flourishes that everyone in the audience will laugh at (bar Illeana Douglas' hilarious turn as Enid's summer school art tutor); some will get the humour, others will just get bored very easily. But a second look at the movie brings to the fore its merits both as a sly comic deconstruction of consumer society, and a telling document of the fears and expectations, or lack thereof, that are crystallised within all people afraid of becoming as 'ghostly' as the freaks around them. Beguilingly good.
1879557541|5.0|The previous reviews have amply summarized, evaluated and (most<BR>appropriately) lauded \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.  I would just like to make a little observation.<br />When Diamond says that the kind of subsistence permitted by the environment in primitive times was an ultimate social, economic<BR>and political determining factor, he comes strikingly close to<BR>an old Marxist theory: the structure of a society is determined<BR>by the natural resources available to it.  It is astonishing that<BR>there should be such a rapprochement of ideas between Messrs.<BR>Diamond and Marx, two gentlemen so vastly removed from each <BR>other in time and ideological mindset.
6303022901|5.0|The Joy luck Club is the beautiful movie of  immigrants, mothers and the daughters, traditions and beliefs. There is something for everybody in this movie. during it, I cried so much that my eyes nearly dried out. It is so touching and sad. It is truly a masterpiece.
6305137293|4.0|Not as good as the original, but what sequel is &quot;as good&quot; as the original??  &quot;Godfather,&quot; &quot;Star Wars,&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones.&quot;  But that's about it.<br />Still, this movie is more than a decent horror flick.  Go with the original &quot;Halloween,&quot; as it is a classic, but get &quot;Halloween 2&quot; to add to your DVD collection.  YOu won't be disappointed.
B00005BL2A|4.0|DM can't seem breathe lately without someone stepping out of the shadows to remark that they exhaled more melodically when Alan Wilder was around.  I just don't understand this.  Listen to The Sun and the Rainfall (Broken Frame), or Love Thieves (Ultra) and try convincing yourself that DM needs help &quot;squeezing blood&quot; from their synthesizers.  Those who find Wilder indispensible to the DM sound should checkout Recoil (his post-DM project).  Years into that project, Wilder is still starting promo material with sentences like &quot;Alan Wilder, formerly of DM...&quot;  Exciter is not Exciter because Alan Wilder didn't work on it.  They didn't screwup: Exciter sounds like a deliberate effort, obviously intended to depart from Black Celebration, Music for the Masses, Violator, and Ultra. Look at the photographs in the liner notes.  DM photographed in DAYLIGHT, outdoors, shirtless--they've clearly been working out--look at those body tones!  Look how HEALTHY they look.  I think of Exciter as something akin to Victorialand by the cocteau twins--a deliberate step further into a well-established sound.  Ultra was a reassurance--to us and them--that the 1990s hadn't pulverized them (plenty to read about on that subject if you're interested).  Exciter is a renaissance.  Comatose is simply beautiful--my favorite new song since Love Thieves-- and the long version of Easy Tiger (on one of the singles) is the best DM instrumental in years.  Lyrically, I find Exciter less bluntly melancholy, more open to emotional subtlety and ecstatic delerium--a development that befits cogent and mature artists.  I look forward to the next installment.

B00001NFCY|5.0|The album is worth buying just for the singles 'Higher', 'Faceless Man' and 'With Arms wide open'...but there's even more great stuff on there. I really like the track 'Beautiful'. Once again contrast between hard rock and soft ballads is a recurring theme in Creed's astounding compositions. Buy it! :-)
B00005QIPH|5.0|I'm not the type to buy stuff because people say it's good, or I heard one song on the radio and liked it and it's stuck in my head all week, or because the singer's \\"really cute\\" (but he IS, ..., he IS!!!!). The Strokes make rock and roll you don't have to think about, just like it, because it is good and simple, like late 60's Stones, Weezer, The Ramones, The Cars pre-80's, or any band that just plain rocks and no one can deny it. \\"Is This It\\" gives me hope for a better future of music, meaning no more of Fred Durst ranting about nookie, no more blonde virginite bimbos with electronically altered vocals, no more middle of the road grunge-hangers-on like Nickelback and Creed and Three Doors Down and, last but not least, no more Mariah Carey shenanigans.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido writes great songs...and yes she wrote most of them herself, quite a rarity it seems in today's music industry. Dido oozes talent and has a sexy voice. Catchy tunes and some great atmosheric music, especially the 'Rosewell' theme song, 'Here with me' which is a great opener to the album. Dido sings about life and love...happiness and sadness. You're sure to find something that means something to you in her array of songs and styles :-)
B00001ZWTS|1.0|My Mom told me if you can't say anything good about something,...<br />... say nothing at all about it...<br />OK, The acting wasn't horrible, but the talents of everyone involved seemed wasted. What a shame.
B000002GH1|5.0|There was a time where U2 and Simple Minds were compared to each other in style as well as stature. This release is one of the reasons. It a huge commercial success, and one of their greatest achievements. Great production and song writing abound here. Everyone remembers the hits off this album, but no one should overlook solid tunes such as &quot;I Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Come A Long Way.&quot;
0800141865|5.0|This is a great film, excellently directed - &amp; acted, beautifully photographed, having to do with the freedom of the individual to express his or her ideas, &amp; how extremely important this is, in a free, civilized society. It is also about the triumph of a human spirit, fighting against all odds for this right. It is one of the greatest modern films ever made, &amp; should be treasured by everyone who loves freedom.
0380973839|5.0|Simply put this is a great book that will leave you amazed.
B00005JKHN|5.0|\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was one of the movies I watched as a child, and its grandness overwhelmed me even at the age of ten. I own a VHS tape only (is there a DVD?), and I have to say even this condensed, standard-screen version shows a gorgeous cartoon adventure with a lovely musical score. The most impressive thing is the story adaptation. If you know the book, you will notice that the passage of time is obviously nonexistent. The Disney staff had the good sense to broaden story vignettes- like showing the prince and princess meet in the forest and fall in love, unaware that they are already engaged to be married; or create a comic sequence with the fairies preparing a surprise party for their charge that goes awry, and simultaneously gives away their hiding place to Maleficent. All of these sequences seamlessly bring the story to a 75-minute feature length film- which is still amazingly compact when compared to fantasy films of today. It is lush, colorful, and full of suspense- especially the fighting dragon finale and the forest of thorns emerging from storm clouds. It's probably Disney's greatest achievement. Check it out in either format.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Lenny Kravitz is a true stand-out in the modern music industry.  Instead of relying on the standard bubble-gum pop or the &quot;lets shout into the mike and call it music&quot; standards, he relies on his natural talent.  You believe him when he sings &quot;Stand by My Woman&quot; and want to sing along with him when he belts out &quot;Let Love Rule.&quot;  His remake of &quot;American Woman&quot; is truly a stand-out: on this song, the focus is on his powerful voice rather than killer guitar licks or a darn good drum player.  Listening to the music of the late 60s and early 70s, Kravitz would be at home during the period, yet his music sounds fresh and up-to-date.  Bottom line: get this CD!
B00005QZ7U|2.0|There's much talk that Luhrmann has created something new with this mishmash, the postmodern musical.  Actually, he's a latecomer if such were his intention.  The brilliant under-appreciated &quot;Pennies From Heaven,&quot; with Bernadette Peters and Steve Martin, either of whom can act and sing circles around Kidman and McGregor, is the film that actually deserves the raves<BR>this tiresome eyesore is now unjustly receiving.  A gilded lily, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is proof patent that too much of a good thing can be far, far less than wonderful.
B00005S8FC|5.0|This CD is truly amazing.  It reminds me of walking through the streets of Buenos Aires at night.  Each song has a perfect mix of accordion and down beats that give it amazing groove.  The CD is whimsical and will make you nostalgic for Buenos Aires OR Paris.  Definitely a CD for drinking red wine.  Buy it!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I'm not sure the issure here is wheather or not (the original) VH1 is a good album. It's without question among the most important albums in Rock history.<br />Instead, this remastered version of what I used to listen to on 33 LP and eventually cassette, is a revelation of just how far beyond their time Van Halen was.<br />Especially Edward. His original rig was little more than a 15 year old Marshall Amp and a few foot pedals bolted to a piece of ply wood. Yet, his sound is still as fresh today as it was 25 years ago when they debuted. Listening to this new CD, especially with headphones, is a real treat. You can actually hear the clicks and pings of his tape-driven delay machine, the Ecoplex.<br />Dave's Appachee war cries are awsome and Alex's drum work is magnificent. And guess what? YOU CAN FINALLY HEAR MIKE'S BASS!
B00000373U|5.0|I own three of elliot smith's cds.  either/or, elliot smith, and figure eight.  what is so great about my collection is that each cd has a certain mood to it.  they're all different but definetly smith.  the great thing about either/or is how it is just his voice and the acoustics.  when you put your headphones on and just listen you can hear every little detail like when he takes  a breath to start a new stanza.  like you're right there.  the music is personal.  my favorite song is number 4 &quot;between the bars&quot;.  THEY ARE ALL GREAT!  IF YOU LIKE LOW-KEY ACOUSTIC THIS IS FOR YOU. HOPE YOU APPRECIATE AND ENJOY AS MUCH AS I DO! ROCK ON!
6305718954|1.0|Pointless and Bland. Two words that describe this movie to a &quot;T&quot;. If you want to see Gabriel Byrne in a horror flick, that is a real horror flick, grab &quot;End of Days&quot; - a MUCH better film (Yeah, the Arnold's film is better than this mess).
B000002J1X|4.0|&quot;Time and a Word&quot; has to be heard in the context of its time - both within the history of rock, as well as within the history of the band itself. The dawning of the '70s found rock music on life support - barely breathing. Psychedelia was dead. The endless blues jamming of bands like Cream and Ten Years After sounded old and tedious. Rock needed a jolt, a new spark of creative energy. Enter Yes. Upon hearing &quot;Time and a Word,&quot; it's hard to believe that this was only their SECOND album. A light-year leap from their first album, this one finds the band really stretching out in terms of composition, arrangement and musicianship. &quot;The Prophet,&quot; &quot;Astral Traveler&quot; and &quot;Then&quot; all point the way to what would soon become known as the &quot;Yes treatment.&quot; Were they ready to record with an orchestra? Probably not. But it wasn't an uncommon experiment back then. The Moody Blues, Deep Purple, the Nice and many others attempted to merge rock band and orchestra at the time. The results varied at best. One can at least conclude that Yes accomplished it more seamlessly on &quot;Time and a Word.&quot; It would soon become evident that Yes didn't require an orchestra to convey their grand musical visions. Something called &quot;The Yes Album&quot; was floating around in their minds. All they needed was a new guitarist named Steve Howe. Rock would never be the same.
B00005OCMR|5.0|This was the first big budget CGI movie, and it is great. People had very strong reactions to this film, loving it or hating it. I loved it, and when you see this updated version you will love Tron as well.
B00003CXI0|5.0|As a 12 year old girl I am one out of millons of big fans of the harry potter series. When the movie came out alot of children didn't want to see it, i was not one of them! I jumped at the chance to see my favorite book come to life on screen. i thought that this was an amazing chance. And I was right. This movie is great. It gives you a different point of veiw on how the characters look and it also gets parents to understand what their kids go gaga on all the time. I am glad to say that my dad has finally seen it and i was the one who took him. It was the fifth time for me. I advise people to get it because it is agreat movie for the family and because this is coming from one of the biggest fans that you will ever meet.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This is a case of &quot;What you see on the boxcover is what you get&quot;. It has some good car chase scenes, Vin Diesel acting tough, and women in tight clothes. I enjoyed watching this movie, it was a mild, pleasant diversion.
B00005JCA9|1.0|I saw this movie on a transcontinental flight and was ready to ask for a parachute about halfway through.  How this ..., lifeless exercise in tedium made so much money and managed to garner so many stars here screams for a new episode of \\"In Search Of.\\"  In this case, it could be called \\"In Search of Entertainment.\\"  Julia Roberts plays a nice Julia Roberts (although I find the nasty Julia Roberts at the last People's Choice Awards more interesting).  Hugh Grant continues his bumbling, stuttering English fop routine.  There's a \\"zany\\" roommate.  One of the \\"big laughs\\" is the sight of Hugh Grant sitting in a movie theatre wearing water goggles...the horror, the horror...I could've used a entire roll of film like toilet paper and run that through a projector and made a more interesting and entertaining movie.  I give this movie five squating dogs.
B00004Z459|5.0|A very good piece of music for people who like hard Crossover beats between H-BLOCKX and Faith No More. On the one hand, the songs are melodic as well as heavy metal. A real good mixture, I didn't hear a very long time. Looking forward for the next album.
B00005RFAI|3.0|I previewed this album in a record store and walked out without buying it. The career making hit, &quot;Get The Party Started&quot;, is the biggest party song since &quot;Who Let The Dogs Out&quot;. It's infectious groove IS the party anthem of 2002 and it's popularity should last throughout the summer. Like the aforementioned creators of the now ubiquitous &quot;Dogs&quot; single, those one hit wonders known as The Baha Men, Pink need not record another note to assure her place in pop history. <br />Problem is everything else on the album pales in comparison. There may be another single here but then again Pink could probably burp into a mic and it would become a hit on momentum alone. But hey, if you're reading this YOU have a computer. Burn the single from a friend or download it. And save a few bucks for something more consistent.<br />-dj craig
B00003Q43A|4.0|I thought that this was a very enjoyable movie.  It's one of those movies that you watch again and again because there are several moments that are just unforgettable.  The effects are top-notch, especially in the early parts of the film, as we see city-sized spacecraft appearing almost out of nowhere to hover over major world cities, and then once all is ready, blasting them into rubble.  (Of course, the shot of New York City on the morning after the destruction, with the World Trade Center damaged but still standing, is especially poignant now.)  However, the movie as a whole is hardly a deep science fiction drama.  I agree with those who maintain that the plot is paper-thin, with several gaping holes in logic.  But, if you can suspend your disbelief successfully for a couple of hours, this movie is a lot of fun to watch.<br />The cast is pretty good.  Will Smith shines as the gung-ho Marine Steven Hiller.  Jeff Goldblum is also great as David Levinson, the computer geek who just happens to be the ex-husband of the President's press secretary.  Bill Pullman is suitably George Bush-like as the President.  James Rebhorn is the creepy defense secretary who almost seems like he is on the aliens' payroll until the President finally gets fed up with him.  The underrated Robert Loggia is the Chairman of the JCS.  But, the two actors who steal the show are Judd Hirsch as Jeff Goldblum's cranky dad, and Brent Spiner as a whacked-out alien research scientist, who really should have had some security in his operating room. <br />To me, the best parts of the film are all the sly in-jokes that parody other movies.  Some of the best ones include:<br />(1)  The point where Randy Quaid flies over a rural road - the shot from his point of view is EXACTLY the same shot as when Kal-El's rocket from Krypton crashed to earth in Superman:The Movie.<br />(2)  Right after that, Randy comes in for a landing on the same road - just like John Belushi with his P-40 in 1941.<br />(3)  \\"Good Morning, Dave\\" - right out of 2001.<br />(4)  Those alien spaceships have more than a passing resemblance to the ships from the \\"V\\" TV miniseries.<br />(5)  The sequence where Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith infiltrate the alien mother ship in their captured fighter is reminiscent of the V'ger flyover from Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br />There's plenty more where those came from, but I think you get the idea.  Basically, this movie is not too deep, but then, it never intended to be.  If you can just relax and enjoy it for a couple of hours, you will love this film.  If, on the other hand, you are one of those who just climbs the wall every time Jeff Goldblum is able to plug his laptop into the alien ship's computer and instantly interface with an alien computer network, then you should give this one a pass.
B0000029D1|5.0|&quot;Live At The Greek&quot; is Stanley Clarke's best music in almost twenty years; however this disc isn't only for Stanley fans. With the incredible drumming of Cobham, Stanley is brought to a level that he hasn't displayed on disc since live 76-77. The ability for these two men to have borderline telepathic interplay is well worth the price of the disc alone. However Carlton, Najee and Johnson all make a generous contribution to the band. There are versions of favorite tunes by all except for Johnson whom I believe didn't have any original material at the time. The highlight has to be the marathon version of &quot;School Days&quot; which features a Clarke/Cobham intro and then it is taken to places the other versions didn't go to.If you are familiar with any of the members of this band buy this disc or if you don't have any Jazz/Fusion discs this is a great place to start. This recording has rock(&quot;Minute by Minute&quot;) jazz (Miles davis' &quot;All Blues&quot;) smooth jazz(Najee's &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;) and all out fusion (&quot;Stratus&quot; and &quot;School Days&quot;) all performed flawlessly and in an engaging manner. There is something for everyone. Highly Recommended.
0345440900|2.0|I found a few ideas to be helpful in this book, but other things are completely wrong and sometimes her attitude is condescending.<br />On the positive side, yes, babies love routine.  This is not her idea.  A bath before bedtime is helpful.  Again, not her idea.  If you never heard these things before, some things in this book will help you.  But don't slavishly follow it.<br />I found this book is very gimmicky and the baby type quiz is rediculous and oversimplified.  Babies are complex human beings not sit-com characters!  I didn't like the cheesy, nanny-to-the-stars tone of this book.<br />My baby is an excellent night time sleeper and I have instinctively done many of the things the author says NOT to do.  I believe that it is important to trust your maternal instincts rather than rely on one of the hundreds of different &quot;baby experts&quot;.  Read several different philosophies and pick and choose things from many different sources and most of all make sure you feel good about what you are doing.  Listen to your own feelings most of all! <br />Save yourself some money (or buy a toy for your baby!) and get this book from the library.
0812550706|5.0|This is definetly the best book I have ever read. I want to read it again and again! Ender has to face many challenges and the men purposly put him up to these challenges to see how tough he is so that he can fight in the war with the \\"buggers\\", an alien race that is threatening human kind. I have read the second one, Speaker For the Dead, and am currently reading Xenocide, the third one. Orson Scott Card is definatly the best author and I love his work and am inspired by him.

B00003CY5J|4.0|Aren't heist movies great? Warm and familiar like a comfy old armchair, they are one of the oldest and (if done well) most enjoyable film genres around. You can sit back at the movie theatre with your popcorn in one hand or at home in front of the TV with a beer, safe in the knowledge that some craggy, world weary old thief set on retirement will be persuaded to do one last job, with a rookie understudy whom he doesn't trust, on a job which you just know wont go as smoothly as planned.<br />The Score is no different in that respect in that it stars Robert De Niro as a craggy old world weary thief, persuaded to take on one last high risk job before retiring. Ed Norton plays the rookie understudy scamming his employers by posing as Brian, a man with a disability and learning difficulties. Of course Robert De Niro's character Nick, always works alone and doesn't trust anybody but he is persuaded by his camp bloated old fence, Max (Marlon Brando) to work with Jack (Ed Norton). You see Max (Brando) is in up to his eyeballs in gambling debts and is likely to be forcibly shuffled off this mortal coil unless he comes up with the money, Jack (Norton) is working on the inside and Nick (De Niro) is the only man with the knowledge and the skills to get the job done.<br />Like most heist movies it's a bit of a slow burn build up, it's all about building up the tension until showtime. Inevitably there are a few scares along the way and Director Frank Oz (yes that's right Yoda, or at least the voice of Yoda) does a decent job in building up the tension. Of course one of the great draws of this movie is Frank Oz's coup in getting Brando, De Niro and Norton all on screen at the same time in the same movie. Brando was in his day was considered to be the world's greatest living actor, a mantle De Niro has carried for the past 20/25 years. Edward Norton is not far behind and is generally considered by many (including myself) to be the greatest actor of his generation on the back of great films (American History X, Fight Club) and great performances (Primal Fear, Rounders, Keeping The Faith, The People Versus Larry Flynt, Everybody Says I Love You).  Robert De Niro is of course reliably good but not at his brilliant best and it is Ed Norton in the dual role of Jack and Brian who has the meatiest part and adds some energy and vitality to the whole production. Marlon Brando's role however, is something of an oddity. It's not much more than a cameo and its something that he could do in his sleep, which is just as well because it looks like that's exactly what he did.<br />If there are any criticisms to be levelled at The Score it has to be on the basis that it really is a by the numbers crime caper and lacks none of the originality or vitality of something like Reservoir Dogs and nor does it really take full advantage of its AAA list cast. The opening sequences whilst interesting, perhaps lack the action and intensity you might wish, although they do serve as an insight into Jack's MO (he always works outside the country, he always plans meticulously, doesn't take chances and is never greedy). That said The Score is enjoyable first and foremost for its excellent cast and the opportunity to see them share screen time. Secondly the last forty minutes of the movie where we eventually get to witness the heist are excellent; the heist is great edge of your seat stuff and there are plenty of unexpected twists and turns and an excellent climax. Ultimately though, you are left with the feeling that you've seen this all before and done better. It's more like that trusty old arm chair, warm and comfortable rather than new and exciting. That said it's an enjoyable yarn. Good rather than great BUT still well worth a watch.eat films (American History X, Fight Club) and great performances (Primal Fear, Rounders, Keeping The Faith, The People Versus Larry Flynt, Everybody Says I Love You).

B00005YTFG|1.0|I had the misfortune of seeing this film at my father's house over the holidays, and came away convinced that I had in fact missed nothing by avoiding it's theatrical run.<br />What might have started out as a novel idea to attract my generation to turn of the 20th century cabaret theater wound up being a self-indulged and haywire production that will leave many viewers with a bad headache. At times, the effects seemed sureal, as if the movie crew was suffering from a collective migrane durring the conception and production of this team.<br />Even the pairing of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who really do deserve credit for trying to make something out of the story) could not save this vastly overrated production from collapsing in it's own excesses. Considering much of the prepublicity billed the film as a nostalgia period piece, some of the selections such as Elton John (and certainly Nirvana) are truly puzzling.
B000002J1U|5.0|Just a nice change of pace from probably the greatest rock band ever, except the Rolling Stones. Exceptional acoustic playing from Jimmy Page plus the beautiful voice of the one and only, Robert Plant. Very underestimated by diehard Zep fans but I like it. After seeing Jimmy Page and Robert Plant doing acoustic onstage several years ago, I bought this album again. Remastered disc just enhances this album for the rest of time!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Well, as you know, Shrek was one of the most popular films of 2001. When I first saw previews for it I thought it looked incredibly stupid, another ... kids movie. However, EVERYONE else I know saw it and said it was hillarious, and kept insisting that I see it. I kept saying \\"No way, I aint seein that ...!\\" Well, every Friday in math class we have our \\"movie day\\", and Shrek was the movie chosen last Friday. I was like to myself \\"Ok ok I'll watch it\\", thinking this would be a stupid corny kids flick......<br />I COULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT MORE WRONG!!<br />This was one of the FUNNIEST movies I've EVER SEEN! I'm 17 years old & I've seen it about 4 times, and NOT ONCE has it failed to have me gasping for air on the floor! DONT be fooled- this is ANYTHING BUT a kids movie- for one thing there's a few swear words. Myers, Murphy, & Diaz do great voice jobs. <br />So if you haven't seen this & everyone you know keeps insisting you see it, SEE IT! you WILL NOT REGRET IT! Hope there's a sequel!
B00005TT77|5.0|This movie was awesome, and with all the songs worked into it, it was even cooler. The coolest is Howie Day because he is hott and the way he mixes his amazing voice and his looped guitar trips is awesome. He is the coolest new artist and once you hear him you'll be hooked. Next is Ben Harper, now that guy rules. His \\"strawberry fields\\" cover is one of the best songs on the CD. This is definitely a CD for anyone, Beatles fan or not. You won't get sick of this cd. Party on.
B000002AH9|5.0|For many years it has been rumoured that Frank Sinatra once stated that almost everything he's ever been taught about the art of singing, and all it's emotional complexities, he's learned from ' Lady Day' Billie Holiday. And to be completely honest, if the formidable Mr. Sinatra had mentioned any other singer when issuing this amazing compliment I would have immediately questioned the authenticity of such a remark. But sublty of phrasing, intonation gathered with an understanding of knowing how to 'sing behind the beat' ( thus awarding the song a sense of urgency ) is indeed only part of what makes Ms. Holiday the quintessential jazz singer. Plus, with Sinatra's well-known musical instincts and unique understanding of the popular song, which proves how intensely he must have been listening to Billie's recordings, I can hardly doubt the respect that he had concerning the 'First Lady of Jazz'. Ultimately though, with her final release in 1958 of \\" Lady In Satin \\" Billie proves, once again, why she simply towers over any other jazz singer of her day....and the many that have passed this way since. <br />What we may have on this amazing disc, above all else, is a study in contrasts. With Ray Ellis ( who Billie dearly wanted to record with ) and arrangements that are lush but never intrusive featuring an orchestra with a full bodied string section, the listener may be taken aback by Billie's fragile singing style. A voice that encompasses such incredible pain ,despair and agonizing heartbreak and one that is apt to 'crack' when reaching for certain notes. But also a voice that is also filled with more passion, deep rooted soul and a worldweariness that fills each song with a honesty and a stark beauty I've yet to hear in any other recording. Beginning with the soulfull declaration of \\" I'm A Fool To Want You \\" Billie reaches an intensity, and a fateful resignation, in the songs mournful lyrics. What soon follows, throughout the rest of this inspired recording, is the voice of a woman who is simp;ly on the verge. One, who after living a lifetime of alcohol, drugs, spousal abuse and racism simply has nothing left but the music that lives inside her. There is simply not a more heartfelt, soulfull rendition of \\" Easy To Remember \\" than the version to be found on this recording. A song, though covered by countless other singers, that literally brings, for me, a deeper understanding of what true, unadulterated love ( and it's sometimes terrible consequences ) can do to a woman. <br />In the end, while they ultimately stripped Billie of her cabaret card in New York, thus preventing her from earning a living as a performer in Manhattan ( a death blow for any singer ) they, fortunately, could not prevent her from practicing her craft in a studio. Upon passing away in a N.Y. hospital Billie had 200 dollars strapped to her leg ( rent money ) and a portable record player ( later confiscated by the N.Y.C. Police Dept. ). Incredible as it may seem, how she found the strength and courage to record a disc of this magnitude is still a mystery to me today. Fortunately, for music lover's the world over, we will always have this unbearably honest and emotionally powerful statement to remind us of this singer's special place in our heart's.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|Enormous hype got me to buy this CD.  But there is little new here.  Adams is largely recycling sounds of those who have come before him.  If you want something from the country-rock section that has some freshness to it, pick up something by the Old 97's.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I used to like No Doubt. I thought they were unusually inventive and clever with a good feel for unusual but catchy melodies and yet still had some rock and roll balls. I liked Return of Saturn and thought it an intelligent follow up to Tragic Kingdom. This album is just awful. It sounds like a Madonna or a Britney album. Clearly someone has decided for sure that Gwen is the star and she doesn't need a band. I feel sorry for the rest of the band. They are just ciphers: there is no guitar, just waves of heavy bass, and hip-hop influenced keyboard. There is no soul, no feeling there is a real band at work, no nothing, just the usual commercial stuff churned out by the music industry to satisfy the teen audience. No Doubt once had some appeal to adults, now they seem to be on the downward spiral of disaster leading to the usual Lopez/Carey/Jackson/Spears/Aguilera pap of homogenized instantly forgettable muzak. Horrible - anyone want my copy?
B00005QIPH|2.0|Enormous hype succeeded in getting me to buy this CD, but not in getting me to like it.  Maybe these guys are great live, but there's little life in this album.
0446677450|4.0|while i knew a pretty fair amount of the basic information kiyosaki put in this book, there are an alarming number of people out there who do the exact opposite of the guidelines laid out in \\"rich dad, poor dad\\". just because you may fancy yourself a financial genius or just generally smarter than the average bear, it's worth keeping an open mind about how to think about your money.<br />i have a MANY friends that i graduated college with who are in deep credit card debt in their early to mid thirties. the kind of debt that could buy or put 50% down a house in the midwest. none of these people are \\"stupid\\" and a most of them make a great deal more the average american (3 to 4 times). the reason they're in debt can be directly attributed to the way that they think about their money and how to manage it.<br />if you have successfully started your own businesses or already have assets that more than cover your expenses, you don't need to buy this book to begin with. spend your fifteen dollars on another asset. LOL. but don't for a second believe that this book couldn't be useful to a lot of other people.<br />the reason this book has gotten a good review from the majority should be an indication that this information isn't taught to enough people. instead of harping on how much knowledge you already had before you read the book, look at it from the perspective of the people for whom it could be very helpful.<br />if you can't think of one friend or family member of yours that does not follow the basic guidelines of this book and couldn't benefit from the accessible style in which it was written, then you have a lot of very successful friends. personally, of all my friends, about half of them could learn a LOT about money management from this book. the other half could probably glean at least enough information to make it worth ....<br />yes, it's repetitive and oversimplified. but as a result i found it definitive and clear. for..., it's worth me buying it and passingit around to my friends that could really benefit from it after i've read it. which took just two readings.
B000021YQV|5.0|Their music do not necessarily please everyone: the explosive mix of thrash, death and nu-metal will keep away pop music lovers, at the same time some slower tunes of theirs may disappoint the Slipknot's fans.<br />What, however, the most of those who gave a listen to the cd agree about, is Toxicity is really something, a really hardly forgettable listening experience, the music that clearly bears the true sign of the guys' songwriting talent.<br />Originality, tunes catchiness, successful mixture of music styles (that really works), and meaningful lyrics, these are what makes the album a big (or small; does size really matter, or can be a very objective measure?) breakthrough in the modern music world.<br />Hardly all of the tracks are the same high calibre hits, and that's very normal. But some of them clearly are: Chop Suey!, Dear Dance, Forest, Atwa, Science, Bounce, Toxicity, Psycho, and Aerials keep impressing anyone with their original sound, changing tempos and music styles, varying heaviness mixed with incredibly memorable mellow moments, and unbelievable vocals that are the soul of the whole cd.<br />Atwa, Toxicity, Forest, and probably Aerials do really deserve to be the singles.<br />Have you tasted the Armenian rock from California yet? Do that, it's worth your money.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I was given Shakira's cd as a gift!-and the one main point i can say about it is, \\"unique\\". I'd never heard of Shakira before, but i have been so inspired by her music i've placed an order for her other albums. From reading other reviews i have noticed that this is the first time she has sung in English and Spanish. I have even begun singing the spanish songs, which shows the quality and \\"catchyness\\" which Shakira portrays. <br />*A must have of 2002-for anyone who enjoys pop with a twist!*
0345440757|4.0|If you are looking for a method or a parenting style such as the ones presented by Ferber, Ezzo, &amp; Sears then you might be dissapointed!  When I read about attatchment parenting for the first time I freaked - wear my baby? Doesn't my back hurt enough already? Tracy isn't trying to teach a lifestyle based on reserch and scientific method.  She just gives advice that has worked for her and thousands of other little ones. I read and reread this book several times in preparation for my first child and found that the main theme was LISTEN and WATCH for your baby's cues.  Yes, Tracy does advocate a schedule because so many new moms need structure during such perilous times as the first few weeks but she also tells her readers to trust their instincts! I did find myself trying to solve all my baby problems according to her book at first but that is my fault not Tracy's.  Her advice put me WAY ahead - I have given this book to my pregnant friends.
078322608X|4.0|when im writing a review for an origianl idea,i must begin it with,HEY GUYS,LOOK,NO RAPPERS/MODELS/SINGERS!!!!!!!!!!just an outrageous brad pitt,and a very convincing bruce willis and madeleine stowe.the premise is that most of the human race is destroyed due to a biological catastrophy.bruce is sent back in time to find whose responsible and in the process,things get mucked up.this is a futuristic,time warping thriller that doesnt rely on special effects.in fact,there arent any outside of the set design.no ray guns,robots,ect...just a tight script,fantastic acting,and a director who takes advantage of these  gifts.the ending still has me semi pist off...i highly recommend this to those sick and digusted at the lameasscrap studios are peddling off as movies...
0345440803|5.0|A follow up to her excellent book, Tracy provides a developmentally accurate and common sense approach to supporting your child's voyage through toddlerhood.  I reccommend this book to every parent.  Very user friendly and full of anecdotes.  Tracy has a strong following and provides constant support to families.  She is a true gem and goes above and beyond.  <BR>Tracy-- thank you for sharing your wisdom!
6303443214|5.0|More thoughtful than you'd expect...  I don't like Pitt or Cruise, but the movie's so dramatic and enthralling, I forgot who they were.  Beautiful score, intriguing story, fascinating direction, plausible acting (by today's standards).
B0000027I6|4.0|As an enormous fan of Pink Floyd, I figured I'd branch out and try some of Roger Water's solo material.  After a bit of research, it seemed \\"Amused to Death\\" was his most popular solo album.  I bought a copy and spent the next few days listening intently.  I found I really enjoyed the CD for its great lyrics and Jeff Beck's guitar licks as well as guest vocals from Rita Coolidge and Don Henley (eagles).  What it does lack however, is the strength of Waters's vocals which were somewhat disappointing in this album.  Waters was generally considered a weaker vocalist than David Gilmour but was successful w/ Pink Floyd on gems like \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Pigs (3 different ones)\\" as well as nearly all the tracks on \\"The Wall\\", which I consider to be the greatest album of all-time.  On \\"Amused to Death\\", Waters keeps his voice at a whisper for nearly all the tracks, which almost comes across as an effort to hide his faltering voice.  \\"Amused\\" also lacks the great, beautiful melodies typical of \\"Floyd's\\" \\"Wish You Were Here', \\"Dark Side\\" or \\"Wall\\" albums.  All in all a good album with high points including \\"Watching TV\\" and \\"Amused to Death.\\"  I would assume that if you are a fan of mainstream rock or pop, you will not enjoy this album.   (4*  out of 5*)
B0000020C4|5.0|I own both the CD&amp;DVD of this concert. And I love it!<BR>Everyone had just done their best. The orchestra and the choir are very good.It is no doubt that Les Mis is the best musical ever.I hope one day i can own both the London cast and the Broadway cast recording.
067144901X|4.0|My son loves Sandra Boynton books.  \\"Doggies\\" is his ultimate favorite!  He enjoys this one because we can make the noises.  He is 16 months and has learned what sound a \\"cow\\" makes... I'm sure he'll learn the others soon enough.  When reading this book to your little one try to make the sounds as dramatic as possible, they will LOVE it!
B0000020C4|5.0|What can I say? Excellent!No more words.It is the CD that you can't miss!<BR>I hope that one day I can own the London cast and the Broadway cast recording
B00003CXI1|3.0|This movie was great for the kids, and it whetted an appetite to see some of J.K. Rowling's magic in \\"the works,\\" but as far as it being better than the books, that couldn't be farther from the truth. I think it would be better off to leave Harry Potter to the imagination, but still... it was kind of cool to see the spells and enchantments of the stories. Take it or leave it.
B00004T40X|4.0|Usually when I think of power metal I think of Timo Koltipelto shrieking about saving the environment. Or, just as often, I think of an obnoxious drummer who may has well be replaced by a drum machine set to &quot;Double Bass Attack Program #3&quot;. Then there's the hideously saccharine lyrics, awkward vocal performances, and repetitive songs. But Ecliptica gives me something better to think about. Sonata Arctica is a fairly new band on the European melodic/power metal scene, and they play hard &amp; fast and carry a great melody while they're at it. Vocalist/keyboardist Tony Kakko writes all the music, and this guy is truly talented. Granted, a keen melodic awareness is fairly common among these power metal bands, but our good man Tony has pretty much everybody else beat. Just listen to &quot;Full Moon&quot;, one of the most absolutely perfect melodic metal songs ever written, I'd say. I can practically guarantee it will have you singing along with the chorus by the end. Musically, the band is heavily influenced by the likes of Stratovarius, but again I must stress the melodic strength of the songwriting. And while there is a sense of homogeneity in some of the 'merely' good speed metal songs, the real strength of Sonata Arctica is found in the mid-tempo songs. The power ballads &quot;Replica&quot; and &quot;Letter to Dana&quot; (love the flute and Celtic influence on that one) are totally great, and the crunchier, keyboard-heavy rockers &quot;My Land&quot; and the awesome &quot;Full Moon&quot; are pure goodness. &quot;Blank File&quot; and &quot;8th Commandment&quot; are remarkable speed metal tracks with fat hooks lodged in the choruses. At the end is &quot;Destruction Preventer&quot;, which starts simply enough but also shows some progressive inclinations that would be more fully explored on the next album, Silence (which I also recommend). Pick this one up.
B000008H1R|5.0|Like other Tull albums, this is not like any other Tull album. (?) If you know Tull, that makes sense. This one happens to be my favorite.
B00005T33W|4.0|\\"Ghost World\\" is based on a serial comic by \\"Eightball\\" scrawler Dan Clowes, who has a knack for examining pitiful characters without regard for the readers' tolerance of weird. I'm a regular reader of his work, and to hear that something of his was going to hit the major screen, I was amazed and thrilled. Im also waiting for Pete Bagge's Buddy Bradley to make his screen debut too, but I wont hold my breath. <BR>When I first heard this was going to be made, I was expecting a full length cartoon, where the characters drift through a blue, black, and gray urban world like the comic. What we get instead is a live, semi-colorful, middle class, just near the suburbs world of convenience and sameness. Kind of like the town I grew up in. Thora Birch plays Enid Coleslaw, and she is mind bogglingly adorable as the pesky, dowdy, splay footed smart aleck  high school grad with an affectation for combat boots and outre culture. The movie spends a slow half hour accustoming the audience to Enid and her girlfriend Rebecca's weltaanschung of sarcasm and disdain for everything around them. This is the essence of the \\"ghost world\\", I believe; they disassociate with everything around them to the point where nothing good is tangible, where nothing happens, just like they expect it to. This, in and of itself, would be relatively intolerable for two hours...enter Steve Buscemi's character, who plays me...I mean..Seymour, another member of a \\"ghost world\\" except he's almost 40. He's an obsessive collector of old music and nostalgia that Enid befriends, and this is where the movie begins to build drama. You can see that these two have everything in common except age and station. They both choose to withdraw from the culture that has judged them inferior. What follows is a suffocating, tragic friendship that Enid can only mess up because she discovers that she is truly scared of everything, and after all, only 18. You wish them to be together, but their ghost worlds drift apart because their union is just as frightening as anything else. There is no happy ending here. In fact, this isn't even a comedy; anyone expecting a slacker send up has rented the wrong movie for the evening. There is nothing exploitative in this film at all, no violence and no sex, just enough claustrophobic human emotion to make anyone squirm. See if your ghost world is like theirs.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|My two and a half year old can't get enough of this movie.  There are plenty of lousy kids' movies out there, even marginal ones...Shrek is the sweetest and most entertaining kids' movie I have ever seen! It ranks right up there with Toy Story on the adults-will-enjoy-it-too scale.  Definitely worth buying!  Get an extra for when your kids wear out the first one.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Before I first saw this movie in French class, I was skeptical. In fact, I expected to sleep through most of it. Chocolate? Come on! We all know what chocolate tastes like... After seeing this movie, you'll never look at the Godiva chocolatier the same way again. To explain this movie would be a waste of time. On must experience this movie themselves, with good expectations. <br />        It turns out to be a great movie, almost like a realistic fairy tale, which gives you a different look at life. It makes you realize all the beautiful things that there are to experience, that most people take for granted, be it love and affection towards others, defiance over your lifelong troubles, or a bite of the most delicious chocolate you have ever tasted. If you can only buy one DVD in the next year, and you have any interest in romantic, whimsicle movies (of chocolate), I among thousandsof other strongly recommend Chocolat, starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp. <br />        (By the way, this is NOT a remake of the inevitably strange 1989 movie with Francois Cluzet. It is a film adaptation of the novel by Joanne Harris.)
031219126X|4.0|When the name Frankenstein is heard the majority of the people, myself included, do not look at or see the political or social issues that affected the world in the 1800s as well as today.  The story is about a scientist who becomes obssessed with the idea of playing god, creating another human life.  Victor rejects his creation causing the monster to not receive the love and affection that he needs.  I liked how the book allowed you to use your imagination when it came to what the monster looked like.  Frankenstein is timeless novel that forces you to think about what scares you most in life.
0345448898|5.0|...This is a powerful trilogy, all the more gripping because it tackles head-on some of the most difficult philosophical aspects of human existence and self-awareness. Harry Potter is merely a flirtation with the imagination compared to the ambitious intensity of the golden compass trilogy. It's mesmerizing but also hard-hitting; you can't walk away from the story without feeling eaten away, as if you'd left part of yourself in that other world.<br />The closest thing I could compare this series to would be the Wizard of Earthsea trilogy by Ursula Le Guin, also a fantastic and somewhat dark exploration into the spirit nature of man. However, Pullman is far more focused on religious metaphors--specifically Christian metaphors--and is certainly overt in his anti-Christian sentiments. Pre-adolescents (under 12) might have a difficult time appreciating the philosophical ramifications of the story, and conservative Christians will find the content somewhat challenging, to say the least.
0571202284|5.0|If you happen to be a character animator that spends time at lunch talking about the principles of animation that are presented in 'The Illusion of Life' or perhaps you animate quadrapeds with the Preston Blair book open, then you definitely want to get this Survival Kit. I opened the book a week ago and started reading and by the end of the day I was a couple hundred pages deep. I opened up a walk cycle I'd created a week earlier and started toying around with the passing poses and the next thing you know I have a 'sad' walk....and then a 'proud' walk...and then a 'lazy' walk.  This book has enabled me to animate quicker and also more effectively.  The simple 'Recipe' style of creating walks with 'Vitality' is a tremendous guide. <br />I'm still not finished with the book because I've started going back over the walk and run sections while applying the lessons to animations that I have up on my computer. I'm convinced that applying the principles and methods described in this goldmine of a book will undoubtedly make anyone a better animator. I have friends in Film, Television, and Games and without exception this book is quickly becoming the talk among those in the animation industry. <br />If &quot;The Illusion of Life&quot; is the animators Bible, then &quot;The Animator's Survival Kit&quot; is the New Testament of what was once a forerunner to this remarkable book.
B000056K04|4.0|A lot of people don't like this CD because it's not &quot;true&quot; to the DMB &quot;vision&quot;. I've been a DMB fan for about 8 years, so I can relate. The new CD is indeed a bit slick. Still, I enjoy it. It's something I can listen to once or twice a week and still love. However, if I was forced to listen to it all day everyday (pun intended), I'd go insane. I am hoping DMB changes directions on the new CD coming out soon.
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M.'s 1992 CD, AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE, remains the greatest album the group has ever released.  From the opening chords of &quot;Drive&quot; to the graceful ending of &quot;Find the River,&quot; AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE showcases the immense talent of this incredible band.  The songs have a wonderful fluidity to them; the different tracks never seem like definite breaks and interruptions.  The mostly acoustic set deals with suffering, sorrow, and yearning, but balances such melancholy subjects with songs filled with desire and hope as well.  Mournful tracks such as &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot; and &quot;Nightswimming&quot; find balance in &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and the lovely &quot;Find the River.&quot;  The band also injects sly humor into their writing with goofy, whimsical poetry (&quot;The Sidewander Sleeps Tonite&quot;) and dry satire (&quot;Ignoreland,&quot; &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;).  The layering of music is just as impressive as the lyrics.  Peter Buck and Mike Mills are incredibly skilled and versatile musicians, and Bill Berry complements them with the appropriate percussion.  Michael Stipe's voice conveys a range of emotions and sounds almost ethereal on some songs.  This is a beautiful album...definitely one that every R.E.M. fan should have.
B000002BE9|4.0|Fiona Apple's album Tidal is incredibly ferocious and delicate along the rumbling sass and swagger or lithe soothes of her voice. Sleep to Dream is huskily rendered, like she told someone off a bit too loudly just prior to it; Sullen Girl reveals the fluid refinement of her vocal chords and her lyrical deftness, Shadowboxer is bold on pummeling, deep piano and voice tones. Criminal--\\"I've been a bad, bad girl I've been careless with a delicate man And it's a sad, sad world When a girl will break a boy just because she can.\\" That about sums up the caustic craft of this song.<BR>Some of these songs are slow-forming but worthwhile (Slow Like Honey, The First Taste) while others are straightforward and almost stifled by mood (Pale September, Never Is A Promise). For all its perspicacity and prodigy, the album can be a bit too etched in intense calligraphy--in other words too fanciful, though there's not much else to complain about here.<BR>Ms. Apple seems tossed about on a rather rocky raft of love and pain but she's not without her revelations.<BR>This album has CD ROM multimedia.
0345440757|5.0|While  I think parents should be confident enough to follow their instincts and needs with their babies, that is especially difficult these days as we are often isolated and without the collective wisdom of an extended family (we rarely help out with other babies all our lives, nor have others to lean on to help us out with ours). In answer to that dilemna comes the down to earth and very respectful wisdom of Tracy Hogg. Perhaps she isn't based too completely on specific research outside her own considerable experience, but I value her approach because it is very common sense, adaptable, and respectful to everyone involved. <BR>She doesn't insist that the parent conform to the baby's needs nor that the baby be stressed with unreasonable demands for the convenience of the parent alone. She truly advocates creating an integrated home where baby is guided by a patient and loving parent, structured with predictable routines (to give baby a sense of power and security as well as to help baby be independent so the parent can be more than his slave). <BR>Some of her techniques sound so effective that one might feel compelled to stress out over the perfect implementation of them in order to get ideal results, but they should be adapted to suit the specific needs of each family; and I know she agrees with that. <BR>This book aims to arm parents with the wisdom and patience and understanding of their child so that we can be true leaders for them, with compassion and authority. She really seems to understand babies, and does a pretty good job of teaching novices how to connect too. <BR>My impression is that one should read this as a baby primer, then parent how you need to, however works for your family, but do so mindfully.

It will let you hear what the bad is made of. This Cd is my favorite because when a band plays live they play more for the crowd. BUY THIS CD EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT THE BIGGEST NIN FAN.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|Watch this trio of films: Moulin Rouge, Shreck, and Carmen Jones. Each in its own way, is a fantastically creative re-telling of popular stories. Each breaks dazzling visual or musical ground, and milestones the genre in some exciting new way, yet is chock-full of references to ... well, lots of other stuff.<br />Therein lies both the genius, and the limitation, of such works. If you're familiar with the referenced materials, you'll marvel at how well familiar songs or visuals can be made fresh again. But if you're not, then a movie like Moulin Rouge will be confusing.<br />Personally, I found Moulin Rouge to be a dazzling film, and the musical genre can never be quite the same hereafter. Director Baz Luhrmamn reinvents pop culture, he very nearly glorifies it with a high-art treatment the likes of which I'd never witnessed before. The only movies that come close, visually, are Rocky Horror Picture Show or maybe Titus. If you will view Moulin Rouge with an open mind, I think you will be truly amazed at what you see.
B000002JKA|5.0|My introduction to Dream Theater was back in November 2001 when I bought their 1992 breakthrough album IMAGES &amp; WORDS.  That record blew me away, and I learned more about the band by visiting their official website.  Recently, I just got the 1994 follow-up AWAKE and even though I&amp;W is great, every song on AWAKE blows that album out of the water!  AWAKE is truly one of the most perfect records ever made, I'm sure of it.  It is notably heavier and harsher than its predecessor, but that's what makes it so phenomenal.  In other words, AWAKE can be seen as the antithesis of I&amp;W--while I&amp;W was hopeful and optimistic, AWAKE shows the dark underbelly of life.<br />I won't mention every song this time, since there's nearly 75 minutes worth of material, but I'll try my best.  &quot;6:00&quot; is an energetic opener with an excellent drum intro by Mike Portnoy and tons of grooves and riffs churning at every turn, which is quickly followed by the emotional &quot;Caught in a Web.&quot;  Great singing by James LaBrie, great melody, and nice heavy riff by John Petrucci.  The Rush-esque &quot;Innocence Faded&quot; also has a great melody and intricate harmonies with a complex jam tagged at the end of it.  Very cool.<br />The highlight of the album is &quot;A Mind Beside Itself,&quot; a 20-minute trilogy hung together by tracks 4, 5, and 6.  It begins with &quot;Erotomania,&quot; a hyper instrumental with classical guitar work and melodic keyboards; &quot;Voices,&quot; thoughtful lyrics, more great singing by James, and lots of power and emotion; and the soft acoustic lament &quot;The Silent Man&quot; ends the epic on a peaceful note.  Perfect musicianship throughout.<br />Tracks 7-11 are also awesome, with John Myung's &quot;Lifting Shadows off a Dream&quot; (which has a U2 feel to it) and the powerful, heart-wrenching closer &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot; being the highlights, the latter featuring a haunting piano melody by Kevin Moore who left the band after the record was finished.<br />AWAKE is a progressive hard rock masterpiece.

The entire show is so entertaining and almost every song Britney sings is already a hit. Everything is really upbeat and fun!!!

It was so awesome!<BR>If you want to see a very entertaining and upbeat show, you can't go wrong with Britney Live From Las Vegas!
B00004Z459|5.0|In looking at my CD collection, I see that Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory stands out big time. This review is coming from someone whose listmanias and other reviews include *Nsync and other Pop music collaborations, so it's not like my other choices in music. The first two songs I were exposed to were &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;Crawling&quot; (both in video form), which left me a bit unimpressed, BUT once the video for &quot;In the End&quot; came along, I became really interested in Linkin Park. There's something about &quot;In The End&quot; that sparked my interest and that something is that it's less edgy than a lot of the other songs on the album. Along with &quot;In the End&quot;, &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot;, and &quot;Runaway&quot;, are my absolute favorites. I like to listen to all the songs on Hybrid Theory, but the ones I listed are the ones everyone could enjoy even if you don't listen to this kind of music. There's actually no category you can put these ultra talented musicians in because they are THAT Unique! But if I have to compare them to other bands, I would have to say that Linkin Park is edgy like Limp Bizkit (but without curse words of any sort, which I LOVE), and lyrically meaningful like P.O.D. I believe that Linkin Park is in a category all their own, so I don't like doing comparison shots on them. Check out Hybrid Thoery for yourself and see (or rather HEAR) what is so great about Linkin Park! =]
B000002KB8|5.0|The absolute heavy metal album. If one should make a choice and carry with himself a record in a solitary island, I think this would be the wisest. OK, Led Zeppelin learned the rock/blues lesson and took it to the extreme consequences (thanks to John Paul Jones-not the Page/Plant duo), Deep Purple added some power to the classic/rock hybrid, but what about Black Sabbath?<BR>This masterpiece witnesses the birth of the most prolificus genre of art of all the times. Thanks Sabbath for giving us HEAVY METAL
B00004RF9B|5.0|As in &quot;better than any other.&quot; No paper-mache monsters here--this film combines an intelligent story with lavish production and special effects. The story hinges on a pair of intertwined mysteries: the overnight destruction of an incredibly advanced alien civilization, and the horrific killings of an earlier group of colonists on the same planet. The answers, when they come, are logical and satisfying, and a second viewing will show that fair clues were offered all along. The film offers much for the eye as well (be sure to get the widescreen version): wide-open landscapes with green twilit skies, a sleek flying saucer of a starship, alien forests of otherwordly trees, Dr. Morbius's elegant villa (where I want to live when I grow up), Ann Francis's short skirts, and a huge, enigmatic, alien machine. Don't come expecting an adrenaline rush, fist fights, dismemberments, or explosions; this film proceeds deliberately, inviting the viewer to think, from beginning to end. The performances are low-key, but appropriately so considering the nature of the characters. The electronic score is also decades ahead of its time.
B000003TA4|5.0|It doesn't really get much better than this in the early 90's, even though I think the \\"high water mark\\" for the alternative scene was in early 1994....this is the album that REALLY got the ball rolling.  There are so many memories linked to this album for so many people who grew up during that time.  This album makes it magical...If you don't have this CD, you are missing out of one of the best since the beatles were still together...
0783226128|5.0|I got tired of seeing the negative reviews for this movie.  Man people this is a GANGSTER FILM!  What do you expect Pacino to do take a walk in the garden and pick flowers while wondering about the love of his life?  HECK NO!  This is a GANGSTER movie.  Pacino does what GANGSTERS do such as kill, curse, do drugs etc. etc.  If you didnt want to see a mobster movie then WHY THE EFF DID YOU WATCH IT?  For a person like me, I couldnt stomach some softie love story movie but I wouldnt bash it because it may be a good movie but just isnt my cup of kool-aid.  You dont wanna see mob activities dont push play on the DVD or VCR when this is in. SIMPLE.  <br />Despite what 112 will have you think this world aint all Peaches & Cream; aint nothing nice about this film it is just telling you how it is.  There are people just like Montana in this world and people like Pfeifer's character (forgot her name) so please step out of your suburbian shell and witness what life these gangsters go through before labeling them 'immoral'.  I believe this movie gets bad ratings because it shows the truth ( not hte whole truth but still) and serves as a reality check for some.  I do agree that some of the scenes are exaggerated such as the ending but then again I remember THIS IS A MOVIE.  It isnt based on real life sequences so why not put some action in this thing?  There is such a thing as ACTION in a film.<br />Now the movie is excellent and is one of my favorites of all-time.  Al Pacino turns in arguably his best performance of his career.  He does curse a lot but hey guess what the package is RATED R, which means if you are for the faint of heart go rent Alladin(by the way also an excellent movie with character development and a nice story-- but thats beside the point).  He comes up with many unforgettable one-liners.  A story of a immigrant from Cuba working his way up the ladder by killing, selling, and decieving.  Like a natural brother he feels the need to protect his sister from all'creeps' and is a little overprotective. * I wouldnt want my boys dating my sister either.*  Scarface shines in its sheer bluntness, and the attitude of the film.  There is no pillsbury doughboy scenes and definitely no apologizing.  Many love this film because it keeps it real for lack of a better phrase.  The soundtrack is also excellent and many scores from it have been sampled, even if it is a little outdated.<br />The DVD itself is basically horrible, The sound is terrible and hard to hear at normal volume.  The picture is pixelated and not DVD quality.  But it does have some nice extras and theatrical trailers.<br />Overall a great movie if you have the heart to handle it.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This film is so inconsiquental to the actual events that happened leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, it is a disgrace to all WW2 veterans. Pearl Harbor was best, and miraciously, rendered in the film &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot;, that this story is just a farce of anything it tries to be. <BR>Apparently, the writers tried to make the film a step closer to &quot;Titanic&quot; in its love story (note...love story is all fiction, and some of the language in the film was never used 61 years ago).<br />The special effects are spectacular, but the filmakers script is so belittled, it makes you wish to know what really happened, not just someone is trying to 'cash in ' on the 60th anniversary of this event. <BR>Go rent or buy &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora&quot; if you are really interested in the Pearl Harbor attack , and try to not make this farce of a story lend itself to the truth that happened.
B00005AAFS|5.0|A Great Disc. This disc shows remarkable evolution from their previous work. They've added synthesized violins and orchestral elements to some of the songs, and they've grown up musically a bit with this album. Their style hasn't really changed from previous works, so if you like the simple guitar riffs with dark yet simple German lyrics over the top, then you'll dig this disc. It still maintains the energy present in those previous works while still manging to be more sophisticated musicially.<br />Songs to check out: Spieluhr, Ich Will, and Mein Herz Brennt. Those three are probably my favorites on the disc, while the title track, Mutter, I didn't find nearly as enjoyable.<br />The Jist: If you like Rammstein, then get this album. If you didn't like rammstein before but you're into heavy music, you may want to check this out - it may be different than you're expecting from Rammstein.

0920236820|2.0|We loved the idea of a princess who would save the prince, but when he didn't respect her...she left him high and dry.  The story is great right up until the very end.  A blunt and badly written ending.  We had to re-write it ourselves in order to get satisfaction from the story line!  Find another book to empower your princess!
B00003CXTG|1.0|It's unfortunate that such potent and emotional material as the attack on Pearl Harbor could be destroyed so horribly.  I could probably write an extremely long, scathing review of the film, but I'll keep the problems succinct (with many spoilers, I might add).  <BR>First, the previews for the film show Affleck fighting during the attack; unfortunately, the \\"shock\\" of his surviving the plane crash in Europe (and ultimately the entire emotional impact of him finding out about the new Hawaii love) was negated by this.<BR>Secondly, director Michael Bay had to produce a PG-13 rating to make all the money back that he spent on making the film, so unfortunately the horror and carnage of war and death has been relegated to the side-lines in favor of eye-popping yet repeticious special effects (wasn't that ship blown up three times already?).  As a sad result, war has never seemed so cool.<BR>Thirdly, concerning history: The script proposes that Roosevelt used his disability to make a point during a crucial discussion in Washington; in actuality, he went to great lengths not only to hide this fact from America but never turned it into an issue or point-making gesture.  And don't even get me started on the film's portrayal of the Japanese!<BR>Fourthly, instead of taking the remaining hour following the attack to wrap up the contrived love-triangle (which truly attempts to be the central story line), the filmmakers opt for a pointless retelling of Doolittle's air-raid on Japan to raise the viewers' spirits about America's retaliating force.  No offense, but we know we won the war--we don't need the end of the film to try and explain this to us.<BR>Fifthly, if the film had even one more American flag floating in the water of the harbor, I thought that I was going to end up hurting someone.  Please, Michael, keep your perpetual hard-on for nostalgia and Americana to a minimum.<BR>And last--but certainly not least--the film uses the oldest trick in the book to solve the love-triangle.  And for those of you who think this trick is resolution, talking issues out, and realizing how all parties involved made mistakes, think again.  For the sake of those who haven't seen it yet, I'll not ruin the awful and contrived ending for you.  <BR>These are only a few unfortunate occurences that happen during \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  Perhaps Bay should realize that he's much more adept at making mindless action films for pure enjoyment, and he should leave the heavier stuff to the professionals who really know what they're doing.
B000001FSR|5.0|Out of all Tom Waits' albums, Franks Wild Years is one of the most original and ingenious. Every song stands on its own as a great work and together they show the terrible and hilarious downfall of a man named Frank. You get this feeling when playing \\"Frank's\\" that you are listening to a musical collaberation between Tom Waits, Hunter S. Thompson, and a random, saxophone-playing hobo that Tom pulled off the Las Vegas Strip in a drumken stooper. Inspired by a play by the same title (in which no one I have spoken to has seen or heard of), this album shows Tom's full musical and lyrical talents thrown into hi-gear. (NOTE: Buyers beware, when listening to some of the  sounds on this album, please refrain from driving an automobile or operating heavy machinery. Exessive use of this album may result in drinking problems) A true gem for any family of Tom Waits Fans.<BR>Set it on a player so that it can be wheeled right up to the dinner table. Suzie and Jonnie with love it every evening with the meal! Just don't forget to invite FRANK! He does love those cocktail wiennies!

0380973650|5.0|A wonderful modern fantasy, Neil Gaiman turns the genre on its head with this book.  No false heroics or quests for rings or captive maidens.  This story is about today's values and how they impact tradition.  Gaiman adds a further novel touch by locating this tale in America's Midwest, the final stop for countless immigrants.  Small towns, flat country, constrained people, far from the rush and bustle of cities.  A perfect site for a cosmic battle.<br />Gaiman has written before of the last battle - Armageddon.  Good Omens, written with Terry Pratchett, pictured an angel [good] and a demon [evil] reassessing their roles before the final confrontation.  American Gods is likewise a departure from the traditional, with ancient gods rising to confront the new American god - Technology.  Odin, whose believers brought him across the Atlantic, conscripts Shadow, an ex-con, into acting as a cup-bearer.  Having lost his wife and the possibility of employment in a stroke, Shadow takes on the role.  He's not a believer, for him it's bed and board.  He grows attached to the idea that there may be something in helping the old duffer - a near-faith hardened by encounters with acolytes of the modern creed.  Odin, known to Shadow as Wednesday, is hardly the epitome  of \\"good.\\"  Technology's adherents, while not evil, are cold, harsh and power driven.  As it turns out, they are typically American - practical.<br />Shadow's role grows from mere go-fer for Wednesday to something more significant.  After all, why does Shadow's wife Laura return from the grave [and are there ever some grim scenes in that regard!]?  Why sequester a go-fer to a \\"perfect town\\" in northern Wisconsin for his protection?  Why do the Technology deities, especially the Media Goddess, work so hard to woo him to their cause?  Shadow dreams with such intensity it would put a normal person in a room with soft walls.  What keeps him sane?  What keeps him going against what appear to be insurmountable odds?  The answers aren't readily anticipated with Gaiman's skillful plot, darting and weaving as it builds.  It's not obscure, but neither is it predictable.  Gaiman's prose holds the reader's attention throughout.  With many threads of story line kept under tight discipline, Gaiman weaves a tapestry incorporating the real and the fantastic, the mundane and the bizarre.  The emerging picture makes compelling reading.<br />Gaiman's research for this book stands out everywhere.  The gods standing with Odin are nearly all Norse deities, but there's a sprinkling of others.  The Greek and Roman pantheons are ignored, perhaps because their adherents were suborned by the Eastern Mediterranean Mob, J.C. and The Boys.  Norse mythology has a comforting appeal, and \\"good\\" and \\"evil,\\" \\"sin\\" and \\"grace\\" had no place.  Besides, in the confrontation with technology, there seems little room for compromise, and a warrior deity to lead the host seems fitting.  Shadow, who has no religion, is gently educated in these northern gods as he encounters them.  They are his collective mentors, helping and encouraging him.  The reason for this attention is finally revealed at the end.  It's worth going there to find out.wers aren't readily anticipated with Gaiman's skillful plot, darting and weaving as it builds.

0767825411|5.0|I was 5 years old when I first saw Ghostbusters. It instantly became one of those films that sort of defined your childhood. You look back on it and are remembered of that specific time in your life. It's always a magical feeling. I still get that feeling every time I see this 1984 classic. I saw it 4 or 5 times in the theaters and watched it religiously on video. It's still a great movie 18 years later. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis wrote the creative and hilarious script, and also co-star in the film as well. Those two, plus Bill Murray , and Ernie Hudson soon after, become the Ghostbusters. Busting ghouls, goblins, and spirits all over New York City. They take special interest in Dana Barrett(Sigourney Weaver), whose apartment seems to be ground zero in a demonic building. Dr. Venkman(Murray)instantly falls for her. This was 1984, and the effects are pretty solid and incredible for point in time. There are some rather cheesy and not so impressive effects(the demon animal, for one), but on the whole, the effects are outstanding. Especially the stay puft marshmellow man. Aykroyd and Ramis seem to have all the paranormnal talk and gadgets down pat in their script. By now, everyoone must know that Aykroyd is a huge paranormal believer, so he knows his stuff. The film, however, entirely belongs to the great Bill Murray. He brings instant charm to his role as Dr. Peter Venkman, and, of course, gets all the best lines. Rick Moranis is also on hand as a nerdy neighbor of Sigourney's, and former \\"Designing Woman\\" star Annie Potts plays the guys' secretary. All the ghosts are done with effective spookiness, and there are ones just for laughs. They all succeed. And, how can we forget the music?. I had to lick the bottom of my sister's shoe to get her Ghostbusters album she just bought for herself. Yes, I was a true fan. The movie was solidly directed by Ivan Reitman. A less impressive, but still fun, sequel arrived five years later in 1989. Ghostbusters is a genuine film classic. A winner on all fronts.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar has been on my &quot;to read&quot; list for years, now I finally know what all the fuss is about.  This matter-of-fact story about a young woman's descent into the depths of depression is nothing short of brilliant.  I watched a close friend suffer for years with the demon of clinical depression, and always wondered why someone with so much going for them would fall prey.  The answer I now know after reading this novel is that there is no answer, it just happens.  Although I believe that someone who does not suffer from depression can never fully understand what it feels like, reading The Bell Jar will likely take you as close as you can bear to come.
B00004XQ83|5.0|As a music student, I was amazed by the beauty and legitimacy of this music.  The songs get right to the heart of what music should be.  The weight of aesthetic value in music is often overlooked by musical scholars as they attempt to judge music's quality, but one cannot deny the simple beauty of these song.  Perhaps anyone who does not like the CD has no sensitivity for aesthetic beauty (evidenced by the fact that he love country music but hates this, and that he can't manage one paragraph in grammatically proper English - see 2/10/02 review).  This is an investment worth making!

How convenient that the girl who's in debt up to her eyeballs, has not one but two of the richest men in England vying for her affections! Don't take this one too seriously and you likely will enjoy.

Wonderful acting, beautiful photography, and a lovely musical score propel Rudy's story along without bogging down in sentiment.

B00005OWIU|4.0|When you look at what John Williams has done before and then you listen to this cd. It makes you wonder if he was building his whole career for a movie series like Harry Potter. The themes are beautiful to listen to and are truely suited to the film. Well worth the money.
B000002U6E|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said in favor of Enigma. My concern, however, is with a previous review where it was stated that Mr and Mrs Kuo didn't get credit for the vocals in &quot;Return to Innocence&quot; If that person would carefully read the credits within  the pages of the cover of the CD, it clearly states: &quot;Return to Innocence: Vocal chant 'Jubilant Drinking Song' arranged and performed by Kuo Ying-Nan and Kuo Hsin-Chu of the Ami Tribe, Taiwan, R.O.C.
B00005JKES|4.0|I missed Twin Peaks when it was first aired.  My wife and I watched it several years later on Bravo and loved it.  10 years have passed since then.  I received my First Season set just in time to give it to my wife for Christmas.<br />Like many other reviewers I was quite disappointed to find that the Pilot Episode is \\"missing\\" from this set - yet not available for sale from Amazon.  Annoying.<br />Also like many other reviewers I quickly logged onto a very popular online auction site and was able to purchase a copy of the pilot from Hong Kong in minutes.  You'll definitely want to see the pilot again before watching the First Season set.<br />I think we enjoyed seeing Twin Peaks even more this time around, even though we could remember what happened.  I particularly enjoyed seeing all the Twin Peak actors 10+ years younger again.
B00004TJTQ|4.0|I watched this movie a few weeks ago with a child I was babysitting. She absolutely loves the movie (she owns the video and watches almost daily. It definitely is a good movie for kids who are in the 8-12 range. The teens won't likely like it, as the movie is slow, and a bit corny and cliched. It's a very simple story about a lonely boy whose mother gets him a dog, despite the objections of his father. The dog, Skipper becomes his best friend.<br />Some of the bullying in the movie was really realistic. However, the way that the other kids finally accepted him seemed false. It really glossed over the topic of bullying. In fact, the movie had a lot of potential issues in it - racism, bullying, war, to name a few - and all were basically ignored because the movie makers were so determined to make this a &quot;nice&quot; movie. Even the sad ending (which I won't spoil) left you feeling ok. There was a subplot involving a cemetary that really didn't &quot;fit&quot; the movie, either. <br />The acting was the best part of the movie. Frankie Muniz was a revelation. Kevin Bacon was absolutely perfect as Williie's dad, and Diane Lane brought style and grace to the role of his mother. I was really surprised by the good work of Luke Wilson as Dink, as well. The quality of the performances alone is enough to make me give this movie high marks. If the filmmakers had only given the story more depth, I'd give it five stars.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I'm not sure if some people know HOW to enjoy a good movie. Despite the reviews, I found this movie very entertaining. Michael Bay did a great job and although I'm sure it wasn't 100% authentic, it still had some trueness to it. People have to realize, movies are made to entertain, just like Titanic. It wasn't entirely authentic, but still had true life scenerios added to it. I recommend this film, It was entertaining.
B00005V0X5|5.0|Oh My GOD! Where do I begin with this one? Last Rites/Loved To Deat, Skull Beneath The Skin, Rattlehead, Looking Down The Cross. Need I say more? This is all classic thrash music. Now that this album has been remasterd, you can hear it how they originally wanted it to sound. Gar's drumming was incredible, Dave and Chris's guitar work is killer, and David Ellefson's bass is awesome. The auudio is very clear now, compared to the original recording. Dave did PROVE that he could do BETTER after being kicked out of Metallica. Megadeth was faster, louder, and more technical than Metallica was. But more to the point, if you REALLY like thrash/speed metal, I HIGH recommend not to miss this one. For all the Dethbangers out there: \\"Rattle Your Head\\".

B00005IBGQ|5.0|I've read alot of reviews on this disc and agree with everyone that it is the most amazing disc to come out in awile.You can play it endlessly, over and over like you used to play your favorite albums back in the 80's when every big artists new album was a major event.This album is one of those major events!I grew up listening to country music which my parents listened to and I just thought that was what grown-ups were suppossed to listen to?From country I ended up loving Elvis Presley....in my early teens I got into Duran Duran and Culture Club and Kiss!Life was great ,a new album came out every year and it was always a big event.Something you had to have right then.More than a decade latter those days of highly anticipated album releases have really slowed.The BEST cd's of the year 2001 go in this order....#3 ozzy osbourne-down to earth  #2 elton john-songs from the west coast #1 rufus wainwright-poses.This is a must own cd .Rufus has given real music lovers something to love once again,something new that compares with the best music of all time!!Every Elton John fan should pick up this cd.As well as all of the KISS ARMY,and anyone else who loves emotion and melody.Rufus Wainwright paints the most beautiful,intricate  picture of life through song I've experienced!
1563894696|5.0|This is a great book. its true to batman and is unique also. the story is great and once u start reading u cant stop. One of the best comic books i ever read!
1587880490|5.0|In \\"Tuesdays With Morrie,\\" Mitch Albom captures precisely and powerfully the most important quality of death: emotion.  In addition, the reader is exposed to the beliefs of a dying man (Morrie) about what is important in life.  These two themes, emotion and values, are unmistakably connected in Morrie's beliefs.  As Mitch Albom narrates the last days of his great teacher, he realizes that life becomes incredibly more rich and meaningful when one values love, companionship, and human dignity above the economic values of a materialistic society.  Even more importantly, he finds that these values are suppressed, in spite of good intentions, if one does not express emotions openly and frequently.  The reader learns with Mitch that to value love, one must live it, an invaluable lesson for all.
B00003CXAA|1.0|After waiting forever for the DVD version, I was angry about the poor visual quality of the film. Aside from the constant grainy yellow look, much of the film is in darkness making it impossible to see the faces of the actors. I'm shocked there would be such little attention to the visual transfer. The audio is fine but I didn't find any of the deleted scenes mentioned making this a forgettable collection. The Sopranos does a far better job. Rent the DVD version prior to buying if you're serious about spending this kind of money, and get a heads up about what to expect. If you're smart, you'll save your money and just get the collection on video -- the visual quality exceeds the DVD version.
0312857063|5.0|I first read Wizard's First Rule in '96. I read the whole book in one sitting & immediately read The Stone of Tears. I'm an avid reader & sci-fi fantasy are my favorites. These two books have taken first place ever since & I've bought full size hardcovers of the entire series. Terry Goodkind has a wonderful way with the characters (Richard & Khalan) I can actually visualize each one & there entire journey. This is the battle of total good against total evil. Some parts even gave me chills. The love of each of there lives that nothing can destroy, but yet action adventure & tactics better than any movie.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I just fell in love with Gratch!
B00005ATQD|2.0|Soft porn everywhere, and every character has sex on the brain, but at least I watched the whole, insipid thing. Cruise as a serious MD? That's a real stretch! Kidman stripping for the world? Not so hot either! A sado/masochist medieval sex orgy?! As boring as it can get! The whole thing oozes with underwhelming 1999 decadence, with the sole exception the scenes with the daughter, and some nice NYC evening strolls, which are ruined by some toughs who think Cruise is gay in one scene!! The whole project is an embarrassment, not least the idiotic medieval orgy scene. And the ending is a joke!! This is by far the worst Kubrick. At least CLOCKWORK ORANGE  could be considered original and maybe even artistic. Heck, even his lesser knowns like THE KILLING, and BARRY LYNDON  are a heck of a lot better than this overblown silliness!! Way below PATHS OF GLORY , and 2001!!! One can only wonder what Stanley would think of this mess!! But any movie I can sit through deserves at least 2 stars!!
0790729628|3.0|Blade Runner, as it was original shown, is a Maltese Falcon set in the future.  The Director's Cut, however, is a sci-fi Hitchcock thriller.  While the Director's Cut is still visually fascinating and taps into some of the same themes, the actuall movie Blade Runner is an infinitely fascinating take on the original black and white film-noir genre and how Sam Spade would fit inside a future world.  If you've never seen either version, I would say get this DVD and watch it today, but I really wish that Ridley Scott would allow the original and much more intelligent thought provoking 1983 Blade Runner to come back.
B00005R87Q|4.0|A non stop movie packed with fast cars and non stop adrenalin rush. These guys appreciate the speed and total ecstacy of driving fast in cool cars....it becomes their life! Enter Paul Walker..he's different from the other guys, he doesn't fit in. Yet when he shows them his car and his speed...he suddenly becomes a cool rider. The group he beomes involved with led by Vin Diesel are in constant battle with a dangerous clique who are willing to kill if they don't get what they're after. Its dangerous, fast and definately furious!!
B000050XEI|3.0|Whilst there are a couple of Enya's songs I particularly enjoy, to be honest after a while they all sound the same ... it's simply a variation on a theme.  One album or perhaps two like this would be understandable, but to just keep pumping out the same old same old gets a bit monotonous.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I thought that the movie itself was in fact quite enjoyable but they left out a few scenes and some important details. Being as big of a Harry Potter fan as I am, I was surprised to find that they even changed the way he looked in the movie. In the books it said Harry had jet black hair and green eyes. Well in the movie they gave him dark brown hair and blue eyes. It made me mad to find they changed the main character. But other than that and the fact that they left a few scenes out it was a spectacular movie. I suggest all who love movies to go see this one.It honestly was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile that I've been able to forget the outside world and enjoy what i was seeing. To all that haven't seen this I suggest you do.
B00005NC66|5.0|This 1960 film involves \\"existence\\" and is always actual. In its vein does not suffer from any type of religiousness or humanisms that plague otherwise interesting films. It is in my opinion the greatest film of all time (superior to Fellini's Dolce Vita and 8 1/2, to Antonnioni's Blow Up, to Bergman's Wild Strawberries, and some few others). Transfer is good, digitally restored recently by BBC , and the film looks better than we saw at theaters back then. English commentary is a bit \\"outsid-ish\\" and stating the obvious, but overall is OK.
6304795254|5.0|This one of the best thrillers I have ever seen and one of the only films I can watch again and again.  Michael Douglas is perfectly cast, playing a character that seems to fit like a glove.  I find his performance to be even stronger than the infamous Gordon Geckko he played in 'Wall Street' and this is a very good job because Douglas holds the film together as the film centres around his character Nicholas Van Orten.  Nicholas is given a birthday present from his wayward brother Conrad, skillfully played by Sean Penn, and this is where the fun and GAMES begin.  I don't want to spoil the plot for anyone but I guarantee if you sit down and watch this movie 'The Game' will take over your life just as it does to Nicholas Van Orten in film.  I am certain that this film will become more respected as it gets older and other than Douglas this mainly down to David Fincher who does an excellent job keeping the complicated plot moving and I feel it is his best effort behind the camera.  This is no mean feat when you consider he has helmed the likes of Se7en and Fight Club.  The biggest credit this movie recieves is that a form of 'The Game' is now played is real life - watch this movie.
B00001U0DP|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. The story has it all. Emotion, Passion, Love, and Comedy. Amazingly uplifting in the face of the worst that the world can through at it. You'll laugh you'll cry, you'll love it. Although the DVD comes with an english voice over I recommend watching it in Italian with English Subtitles. It is not distracting at all and adds to the beuty of the movie.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|At first I didn't know what to make of this movie, as the first part was just total chaos.  But after I while I was totally enthralled, enjoying the music and following the plot line. <br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor were absolutely gorgeous together and the singing and music was just fantastic.  <br />It's truly a unique film.  I plan to watch it again.
B00005T30L|5.0|First of all, let me just say that this movie is not for everyone. It's for the people who enjoy the extremely quirky comedies like 'Rushmore'. The comedy here is not the laugh out loud type (although in some parts I just couldn't help cracking up), it's more the intelligent chuckle type. The film features Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen as two very cynical high school graduates, Enid and Rebecca respectively, who torture and ridicule the pop culture infested folks around them. They find joy in calling up people in the personal ads, inviting them on a date and then watching the stood up person's agony. But things change when they play this trick on Seymour (played by a brilliant Steve Buscemi), a dorky, avid collector of records and 1930's memorobilia. What enfolds is a story that could be called a coming of age one. Enid and Rebecca realize that they are growing apart in ways they can't help. The film is directed with ease by Terry Zwigoff and features amazing performances from all involved. The story features some seriously screwed up characters included a man named Norm who waits day in and day out for a bus that never comes and a video store worker who mistakes Fellini's '8 1/2' for the soft core porn '9 1/2 Weeks'. If you're looking for a film with an interesting story or just feel fed up with the Britney Spears obsessed culture around you, pop this flick in and revel in the cynicism. It's a trip and I highly recommend that you take it.
0451169514|5.0|Just like the blurb in the beginning of the book, this really is the Moby Dick of Horror, hands down.  I was apprehensive to start this book, listening to family members that have advised to stick to his \\"older\\" books.  I'm glad I gave IT a chance.  What a story.  Unbelievable attention paid to detail, and great characters, as always.  <br />What I didn't understand was the ending.  What was accomplished by group sex?  I'm lost.  Nevertheless, the ending didn't spoil its prior pages.  An amazing book.
0679746048|4.0|Disturbing, but sensitive and thoughtful. Is it really just a judgement call between \\"normal\\" and \\"insane?\\"
0671024256|5.0|If you're looking for a magic \\"How to Become a Successful Writer in 5 Days or Less,\\" look elsewhere.  Or better yet, look here to see why there is no such book, regardless of what the title says.<br />Stephen King's _On_Writing_ is Strunk and White's _Elements_ with skin on.  S&W provide a strong skeleton for good writing, but King makes it breathe.<br />Part memoir, part workshop, _On_Writing_ is a fascinating book.  But more importantly, rather than a recipe for birthing yet another generation of hack writers, King tries to provide his readers with a look at the love and work of writing.<br />He sums it up this way in his third forward when explaining why the book is so short (less than 300 pages), \\"Fiction writers, present company included, don't understand very much about what they do -- not why it works when it's good, not why it doesnt' when it's bad.  I figured the shorter the book, the less the [b.s.].\\"
B00005V0X5|1.0|I know all you Megadeth fans instantly hate me. Good. I always get the feeling most of you would rather give Dave Mustaine a hand job rather than listen to good metal. <br />The production is still god-awfull. Dave's vocals are the annoying and pointless. Um...hello! Megadeth isn't good thrash people! I've heard every album and one work always comes to mind, panzy. <br />Well, now that it's out of my system I feel much better. It's always nice to comment on bands that lack anything cool. You people have a nice day.
0451204530|5.0|There are certain plot devices in fiction that raise red flags with me because they are almost always indicative of a lack of originality:  the two that stand out the most are the use of twins and even worse, amnesia.  But any cliche, in the right hands, can become something special.  Follett first demonstrated this with The Third Twin and now, in this amnesia-driven story, with Code to Zero.<br />Follett is known as a master of the spy thriller, and this story demonstrates why:  likeable characters, evil conspiracies that slowly unfold, constant action and romance.  It surprises me that there seems to be so many negative reviews for this work, when there is really nothing significantly wrong with this; in this genre, Follett does everything that is expected and does it all well.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is just too good.  The beginning song battery gets this album off to an excellent start.  Very fast and very well played.  Next the title song is an all around masterpiece.  Mixing excellent heavy riffs and melody and the signature metallica `heaviness'.  This in part also due to the presence of Cliff Burton, whose bass playing is still among the best recognized anywhere.  The next tune, `thing that should not be' which live they play it way awesome, is another well written and executed tune.  Worth mentioning also is Cliff Burton's bass intro to damage inc which will leave you wondering that it would have been a great idea if he had released an album with him on bass, and all the awesome sounds he got out of it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is incredible, his songs are soulful and unique.  If you're old they remind you of how you saw things in your youth, if you're young they express things about yourself.  Mayer is very talented and I expect to hear alot from him in the future.
0060920084|5.0|The publication of the new Bill Bryson boom is now a landmark in my calendar, but this is the book which set it all off. It's simply one of the funniest books I've ever read.<br />However, the book was published some years before A Walk In The Woods, and made Bryson very popular in the UK well before the latter book broke him in the USA. I'd always wondered what US residents would make of his observations on their country, and it's fascinating now to see how varied the reactions are below. These range from the ecstatic to the 'how dare he have a go at the US when he hasn't lived here for 20 years'.<br />So, I'd simply say this. The writing is first class and witty throughout. If Bryson seems a little jaundiced at times, I think this simply shows that he's lived in the UK for 20 years, and that he's illustrating how different the US and British sense of humour can be. But I don't think he's bad-mouthing his country of birth. If anything, the book is affectionate about the country, warts and all. In fact, since the day I read this book, I've wanted to emulate his journey - I only need 3 months off work!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Over the last few years, Prince has been trying to throw a few hits onto his albums, trying to capture some hip-hop listeners, trying to be liked.  Here, Prince is just doing his own thing and doesn't seem preoccupied with what the mainstream thinks.  At last!!!  It's nice to hear him doing what sounds good - regardless of whether or not he'll get radio play.  Sometimes it doesn't quite work, but most of the time this album is amazing.  Fantastic musicianship, and really adventurous.  You should buy this.  And hey - if you want some more about Prince's music, check here!
B00005OWIU|5.0|With this musical release John Williams yet again establishes that music is not just a background to the film, but more a character. Williams has proved once again why he is one of the greatest movie composers of all time. The music this album, while seems to have been strongly deviated by songs he wrote for Hook, is a wonderful part of the movie. Eventhough he is getting a little bit older, Williams has proved that he is the top composer for any fantasy movie out there.
B00005RZV4|5.0|I started getting into NIN and more industrial music about a week ago. I listen to mainly thrash, metal, death/black metal, and classical music, and I wanted to expand my music intellect. I really love \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", but my local Hastings store didn't have it, so I decided to pick this up. This is an incredible live CD! One of my favorite live CDs as well. So I can't talk about the band, I guess I'll talk about the songs.<BR>   Terrible Lie 10/10- Probably one of the best industrial songs I've ever heard. This is an awesome song, with incredible keyboard work and singing by Trent. <BR>   Sin  10/10- This song is great. It sounds like there are 20 keyboardists up there. The drumwork is excellent as well. Very fast and upbeat. 1 of my favorite NIN songs.<BR>   March of the Pigs 8/10- I like this song a lot, because of the awesome guitar work in it, but I think its better on CD. <BR>   Piggy 8/10- Very slow, very dark song. Sort of reminds me of old 007 movies for some reason....<BR>   The Frail 10/10- This is seriously some of the best piano work I've ever heard. Its so dark, so awesome....Reminds me of Super Metroid on the SNES, if you guys can remember that. <BR>   The Wretched 7/10- Pretty good. Dark, but it doesn't click with me for some reason. <BR>   Gave up 8/10- I don't like the punky feel of the song, but the industrial parts are awesome. The drumwork is great as well.<BR>   The Great Below 10/10- I love the keyboards yet again. Sounds like it requires 10 people playing the keyboards, and Trent sings very well. Dark, dark, dark, dark and beautiful.<BR>   The Mark Has Been Made 10/10- Very beautiful and dark stuff here. Trent's (which I believe is the guitarist too) guitar wrok is superb, and the effects he uses on his guitar are awesome. The keyboards are awesome, and the bass is really low on this song.<BR>   Wish 9/10- One of NIN's heaviest songs. Great drumwork, and the samples are awesome.<BR>   Suck 6/10- Simply one of the strangest songs I've ever heard, but I don't like it.<BR>   Closer 10/10- One of the best songs on the album. Awesome drum intro, cool guitars, and downright haunting. Trent's vocals are DEMENTED. <BR>   Head like a f****n' Hole 15/10- This song got me into NIN and industrial music in general. Awesome guitars, cool keyboards, great samples, good drumming, and great vocals. This is one of the best songs I've ever heard, and this is one incredible song live. This song and Pretty Hate Machine was WAY ahead of its time.<BR>   The Day the World Went Away 10/10- Beautiful keyboards and singing, and some of the best guitar work Trent has done. Awesome samples, great drumming. One of the best and darkest songs on the album.<BR>   Starf****ers, Inc. 7/10- Interesting name, eh? Good, but I didnt like it as much as the others.<BR>   Hurt, 10/10- Hurt is a beauriful song, with melodic vocals from Trent, and wonderful guitar work. This was one of the first NIN songs I heard, and it's definetely one of my favorites. Dark and melodic.
B00005A1PR|5.0|When I first heard India Arie's song,\\"Video,\\" I liked it, but not enough to buy the album or to think she was all that special. I liked \\"Video,\\" but it takes more than one song to make me buy an album. Then \\"Brown Skin\\" was released, and that did it!!  After I got this cd home... it took me a while to listen to the whole thing, but after I did, I was so impressed. Boy was I wrong about Ms. India \\"Special\\" Arie! I didn't skip one track. The lyrics and vocal arrangements aren't cutting edge, but they're so REAL that they make you stop and take notice... but they're soft enough to relax and think to. I play this cd while I'm studying or on my way home from work to keep me relaxed while driving next to all the road hogs and idiots on the road. India Arie is undoubtedly my favorite new artist of the year. Her lyrics and vocals are so much more sincere than that of Alicia Keys, which is why I'm pushing for her to take home multiple grammy nominations this year. I feel ya girl... keep doin' what you're doin'. Keep your Strength, Courage and Wisdom... and I'll be waiting for round 2!!
B00003CXA4|5.0|I can't describe how utterly beautiful this movie is. The scenary, photogrpaphy and (of course) the subject matter are so captivating it is hard to turn away from this. I think this movie accurately pays homage to one of the greates figures in history. The only thing I would warn is that even \\"roughnecks\\" like myself get teary eyed during the movie. It was pretty awkward when my college roomate walked in while I was watching the movie and asked \\"Are those tears?!?!\\" In times of chaos and despair this movie stands as a testament to compassion and love.
B000005IS1|5.0|Raw band from Detroit recorded live in 1968. If you like hard driving R&R listen to \\"Kick Out the Jams\\". This album is the essence of the energy in R&R in the 60's. Live \\"you must choose whether you are going to be the problem, or whether you are going to be the solution.\\" the crowd is going wild. Rambin Rose\\", \\"Motor City Is Burning\\" need to be listned to at high volume. This is a must for your R&R collection.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|When a soundtrack is done right, it should complement the movie it was written for so perfectly that it is integral to the whole.  When I listen to this soundtrack I can vividly see the images on the screen; this movie, which I consider an impressive work of art, would not be the same without its music.  But the music never overpowers or dominates - it doesn't even tend to get stuck in your head until you've seen the film several times because it isn't SUPPOSED to.  I loved the vocal writing.  I loved the contrast between the harsh, percussive, and threatening Orc-Music, the serene stillness of the music for the Elves and the Fellowship in their less adventuresome moments, and the innocent, carefree, and folksy Hobbit-music.  I have to say that one of the best musical moments for me in the film was in Isengaard when the Orc-Music faded out as the view panned up to Gandalf and the still, chilling beauty of the voice became all we heard; then, as we zoomed back down to the Orcs and Saruman, the voice faded out and the Orc-Music came back.  I think this is a fantastic sountrack that stands up to the best.  I honestly can't think of a thing I'd change!
0553577123|5.0|I definately reccommend this book. Anne wrote with such vividness that I actually felt I was in the \\"Secret Annex\\" with her.She was a truly gifted writer and the emotions she felt(in spite of her circumstances)were so easy to identfy with. This book should be required reading in the schools. Not only does it personify the cruel insanity that was the Holocaust,it is a great book about a remarkable young woman discovering herself and her talent for writing. Just read it.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a book I put off reading for a very long time. I thought I would not be interested in the plot or (even worse) hate it altogether. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The book is a sort of diary outlet for the lead character \\"Charlie\\" (That could be his real name, and it could not). Charlie writes to his \\"friend\\" quite often as his life becomes increasingly complicated. He looks at life with a refined wisdom and a long line of new feelings every day, he has an undeniable innocence and a good character development. <br />The book is tragic in a way. I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read it, but it is heartbreaking to realize why his character is the way it is. On the way to all that sadness, however, are some wonderful times with his friends Patrick and Sam and a lot of the usual self-discovery themes. The book tends to revolve upon Charlie's school reading assignments, and there are often veiled references to characters and plots from the stories mentioned. <br />The perspective on life is fresh and light, with very little unnecassry information to drag down the plot. It's a book very similar to The Princess Diaries or \\"Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging,\\" yet keeps a very clear and refreshing plot. This is a book every teen would enjoy.
B000002LND|5.0|Documenting Madonna's first decade was so vital in 1990. Immaculate Collection, containing 15 of her most essential hits and two experimental bonus tracks, spans the mega star's catalog like a dream. Anyone looking into her stuff for the first time must get this best of collection first, and then on to the studio records like Like A Prayer and Ray Of Light. Opening with the whimsical, effortless \\"Holiday\\", the album sports Madonna as tramp video vixen extraordinaire (\\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Into The Groove\\"),ballad queen (\\"Crazy For You\\", \\"Live To Tell\\") and experimental envelope-pusher (\\"Papa Dont Preach\\", \\"Express Yourself\\")all leading up to her then new obsession: SEX. But wasnt that what she was always tackling? \\"Justify My Love\\", the album's first new single deals with it head on in Madonna's heavy breathing, yet elegant way. If she had followed this formula on 1992's Erotica, that album wouldnt have turned into such a sexual train wreck. \\"Rescue Me\\" is mildly entertaining in its own right. Immaculate Collection pretty much squashes 2001's GHV2 in the battle of the best ofs. Madonna seemed to be more on top of things in the 80s era, although she has kept her trendy and diverse taste still in the groove.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|First of all Directer did a very bad job translating a video game with lot of action and plot twist into a movie.  Example; there was a scene in the film where Ms. Jolie was tied to a bungie cord contraption and the bad guys(milutary types) came bursting in her house and after about a million bullets, a couple of wall running  and flips not one I repeat not one person was shot. In the game all those guys would have been blown to bits.  It was like they tried to turn a R rated video game into a PG movie and doing that they spoiled what could have been the best VideoGame Movie translation ever. If the script was written in the same context that the game is portrayed this would have been a better movie.  There were times  during the movie when I wanted to go to the box office and demand my money back.  If you are a fan of the game(1st one was the best) do not see this movie.  Once you get over how good Angelina Jolie look in her outfit you'll realize that the film was pure [junk].  The reviewers that gave the film more than 1 star  must not have been watching the same movie I was.
B000002U82|5.0|This is a MUST for any 70's rock fan. Some people may say these guys didn't have the musical talent that some groups did of their time, but with the combination of Gilmour and the mastermind Roger Waters these guys released one of the best albums of all time in Dark Side of The Moon. Classical rock fans who actually respect true music will fall in love with this album, and don't let anyone convince you anything but. If you are a new Floyd fan, I strongly suggest this as a starter for your collection. This album is definately up there with Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall. <br />Pink Floyd offered material in Dark Side of The Moon that had never even been attempted in the music world, brilliant songwriting that was really out there and had a never ending presence that has kept me playing this album over and over...face it this album ROCKS!

B000026OHN|5.0|This has been my favorite recording of the WTC (and one of my favorite recordings of anything) for years. While there have been many very fine recordings of the WTC, in my opinion, none comes close to the poetry expressed by Richter in this set. I think the crucial difference with Richter is that he never just plays the notes, he is always looking for, and finding, the beauty of the music. There is literally something special in every moment of his playing.<BR>If you are looking for a recording that will repay the deepest listening and the deepest concentration on your part, look no further, this is it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Im not even sure how to approach your heinous review Rickey...but your totally off the mark. I have not heard a singer/songwriter with the passion and sensitivity that John Mayers possesses in quite some time. I was truly floored by your review and the fact that you harbor such animosity...almost seems personal! Im not sure how you got the gig to review for Amazon but you must be in writing for the wrong division...try reviewing some limp biskit or creed...im sure you think theyre really talented.
B00003CXTF|1.0|\\"Pearl Harbor is a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours,about show on Dec.7,1941,the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle.Its centerpiece is 40 mins of  redundant special effects surrounded by a love story of stunning banality.The film has been directed without grace,vision or originally and although you may walk out quoting lines of  dialog,ti will not be because you admire them.The filmmakers seem to have aimed the film at an audience that may not have heard of Pearl Harbor,or perhaps even of WW2.This is the our weekly reader version.If you have the slightest knowledge of the events of the film,you will know sense of history,strategy,or text:according to this movie,Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut off its oil supply,and they were down to an 18 month reserve.Would going to war restore the fuel sources? Did they perhaps also have imperiolist designs?Movie doesn't say.So shaky is the film's history that at the end The Tokyo Raiders crash land in China,they are shot at by Jap patrols with only a murky throwaway explanation about the Sino Japanese War already underway.There is not a shred of conviction in love story or chemistry,but Evelyn is a hero in the aftermath of the raid.Another hero was Dorrie Miller that got a machine gun and shot down several planes and cernal Dolittle that led the attack on Japan.How can planes,ships,and houses exploding be excellent when people are dying and flying everywhere?This movie is not about the people that died at Pearl Harbor at all.
B00003CY5J|5.0|This is the first and last chance to see three successful generations doing a GREAT movie. Robert De Nero adds another successful mission to his life... but when it comes to Edward Norton, oh THIS GUY IS MORE THAN WORDS CAN SEE!!! <br />Some actors are born to be Stars... and Ed Norton acting job is so POWERFUL. Ed Norton's roles can never be played by another actor (remember \\"Primal Fear\\"?). He is so talented that he can fool the audience every time with his acting! He can generate successfully different faces and characters in his roles that no other actor can do!<br />The story is thrilling... and the suspense is high... and the acting is remarkable!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I canno't believe someone actually wrote this movie.This is  the worst film i've ever seen.Stupidly obounds.You can bet ill bet getting my money back from Blockbuster.My 5 year old sister could write better romance lines.The movie should not have been called&quot;Pearl Harbor.The part that didn't really happen&quot;I mean,wow,to think that the only reason Pearl Harbor happened was because of 2 nurses friends.
B00000IP3S|5.0|While I tend to find a number of power metal bands generic, and overly derivative of Helloween (e.g. Freedom Call), and while I find many &quot;Fantasy Metal&quot; bands have lyrics that are so bad that they don't even work as comedy (see Rhapsody for prime examples of such), Blind Guardian defies the odds, and pulls off a pointedly unique and completely unembarassing masterpiece of fantasy-influenced power metal.<br />    Rather than relying upon purely linear musical arrangements, Blind Guardian explores the possibilities of harmony, while maintaining an almost primal sense of aggression, welded to a contradictory ethos of musical beauty.  The result is an album that crushes like older Metallica, but soars like Queen in its prime.  Although English isn't the band's primary language, they avoid rote, grade-school &quot;I am a mighty warrior&quot; lyrics, and write about subjects such as the anti-hero as tragic figure (Mordred's Song), how cynicism has robbed us of the willingness to abandon ourselves to fantasy (the title track), and the dark side of &quot;glorious crusades&quot; (The Script For My Requiem).  Hansi Kursch's operatic growls and bellows are counterpointed by both his more delicate moments, and by the everpresent army of Andre Olbrich's harmonized guitar overdubs.  Thomen Stauch's drumming alternates between Bonham-inspired rock-steadiness, and speed-metal double-time mania,while Marcus Siepen's rhythm guitar grinds like nobody's business.  By the time &quot;And The Story Ends&quot; closes the album, you'll be ready to restart the album.  Run out and buy this album.  NOW.  Trust me.  It ain't a kitsch thing; it's knowing good quality.  This ranks up there with Angra, Rage, Virgin Steele, and Symphony X (all top tier metal bands).....but even better.
B00003CXTG|1.0|[...].I am a major movie buff and this was just one of the worst movies i've ever seen.It was so awful I couldn't.It wasn't realistic,bad story,and very predictable.The only reason this movie did well at the box office is because of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett.In fact I could tell just by the previews.I gave  this movie thumbs down and a 1 out of 10.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I have read some reviews that claim this movie is not as innovative as it seems...I disagree mainly because no movie has been so well made with the story moving both forwards and backwards to the climax of the movie.  If there has been a movie like this I have not seen it or heard of it, and I seriously doubt the acting or directing will be comparable.<BR>The fun of the movie lies not in guessing the climax, but in the causes, a more difficult task than it sounds, since the movie definitely is a little strange, and certainly disturbing.<BR>Hopefully Pantoliano and Pearce will be nominated for Best Actor, as they richly deserve for jobs very well done.<BR>Highly recommended.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor the most definately the epic drama of 2001.Spectacular special effects and great acting.Many people think the love story in here made this movie look bad.It did not,I mean they could have shortened it by twenty minutes but the effects were spectacular and it should get nominated for several Oscars.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is a great band that offers a lot. On Hybrid Theory, there is a combination of rock/metal/rap. Not one song on the album is bad, everyone is great and for the parents- *THERE ARE NO BAD WORDS ON THE ENTIRE CD*. Most of the cd is rock/metal, but there are a few parts with a little rap. <br />Linkin Park has been compared to Limp Bizkit, but I think they have a completely different sound, and in my opinion is much better. Limp Bizkit is mostly sreaming and cussing. I have nothing against Limp Bizkit, but that's just how they are. Linkin Park combines harmonic sounds along with the hard rock sounds they play, and it all blends together smoothly and makes a great sound.<br />Linkin Park is one of the better, new rock bands out there today, and I highly recommend this cd! I can't wait till their next album!
B00003CXTF|1.0|Mistitled as being about a battle that takes place about halfway through the film,there is so much in this film that is fictional or mistaken that this film is barely worth of being represented  as&quot;The film about Pearl Harbor.Some of the supporting characters are based upon true historical people,and their stones are also the most interesting.I would have to seen anyone,of their parts larger,rather than what this film is obsessed with...a patiently false romantic triangle brimming with platitudes and corny dialogue.The worst part of this movie is the first half,which contrates far more on establishing the three fictional characters.After Titanic became a success the studio found a way to make money.The 40 mins of action are great,but everything else is just not good.Just don't see this movie for anything in the world.
B00005UKKF|4.0|First of all i taped this concert from HBO when it was first shown,so i pre-ordered this DVD when i found out it was available.I thought the concert was amazing,even though Britney is lip-singing through most of the concert.I only have one fault with this DVD,the vhs i taped sounds &quot;live&quot; but this DVD doesn't!Thanks,to all the technology of making things sound &quot;perfect&quot; Britney's live performance doesn't sound live at all!I am a big Britney fan,i have been to both her concerts in Raleigh,North Carolina in the past two years.I think her music sounds better live,and i just knew when &quot;Live From Las Vegas&quot; came out on DVD it would be awesome,but i was very disappointed with it.So if you don't care how it sounds its a great DVD to buy,but if your looking to hear a &quot;live&quot; concert don't buy this one because the only thing that sounds live are the fans at the concert.
6303182577|5.0|this is the best of the hippie festivals of the 60's/early 70's.<br />unlike others they show the full performance of the artists, not to mention interviews with actual people who attended and a few artist.<br />this is definitly a piece of history and a good buy.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I cannot agree with those who say this movie was terrible - I found it was an absolute delight, and I felt it melded Kubrick & Spielberg beautifully!  Such a dark film, but at times it showed humanity as we cannot imagine it being, through the eyes of someone who desperately just wants to be loved - that is all.  The acting was superb.  Obviously thought, this film is not for everyone - it's a mental journey.  It's not Clockwork, and it's not Close Encounters.  It is of its own, and a beautiful vision Kubrick would have been proud of.
B00000IL29|5.0|This is a great album to get if you are just getting into jazz and want to hear some quintessential 'hard-bop'.  Every song is is great, captivating and fresh, even after 30-some years.  If you are a jazz fan and you don't have this yet, what are you waiting for?  The line-up here is tremendous.  Essential.
6303942830|5.0|This film is a magnificent interpretation of Fenimore's classic work, bringing vividly to life so many of the unforgettable scenes described in the book. Fenimore's prose can sometimes be heavy going, but the film has extracted the essence of the plot faithfully (there are some differences but nothing drastically Hollywood eg The Man In The Iron Mask) . The actors chosen were perfect for the role. Daniel Day Lewis is the quintessential Hawkeye, all one imagined the character to be. He is a very fine actor and this is one of his truly memorable roles. Another classic performance is given by the character who plays Magua, his every expression conveys hatred and a deep sense of malice. All the supporting cast do a fine job in conveying an authentic feel to the historical drama. The story is set amidst breathtaking scenery of forest, river and mountains, and the haunting music plays in your mind long after the film is over. The costumes are just gorgeous, the camera captures every detail of colour and form. From the opening scene of a stag being hunted to the unbearably moving final scene where the last of the mohicans contemplates the loss of everything in the world dear to him, of ideals betrayed and greed and cowardice triumphant, there is not a wasted moment. The film gives a realistic portrayal of what true love is, without &quot;Titanic&quot; style theatrics. Given the backdrop of savagery and bloodshed, the love theme is all the more poignant. You can watch the film at two levels. One level is just good old fashioned entertainment, with your heart beating faster and faster as the final scene approaches. You can also interpret the film at a deeper level. Many of the events depicted in a fictional setting in a frontier environment are actually happening today, not just in America but all over the world, the context is different but the struggle is the same. The film is very inspiring, and can be watched over and over again. Together with &quot;Rob Roy&quot; , thesetwo films are to me the best adaptations in the 1990s of classical adventure stories. There was an older movie version made in the sixties, but that version pales in comparison to this definitive adaptation. The only criticism of the film is that it should have been made as a 3 hour film so that the character of Uncas and the younger Munro daughter could be developed better, as in the novel but this is a minor point. You might also like to consider re-reading Cooper after the film, it makes the book seem more alive now you can visualise the settings of some of the scenes. I'd strongly recommend this film to anyone looking for high drama, great acting, a thoughtful script and fabulous locations. Its rare to come across an adventure film that makes you think deeply !
B000000YG5|4.0|A good place to start if you are not terribly familiar with Sonny Rollins.  It was nice to see this disc showcased on Ken Burns' &quot;Jazz&quot; special on PBS last year.  Some argue this is not Sonny's best work, but it seems to be one of his best known works.  The opening track has a great ambiance to it and &quot;Strode Rode&quot; is also a great piece of work.  Nothing weak on this album-it's all good.  Recommended.
0790749815|5.0|Aside from being one of the greatest movies of all time, this has got to be the best looking dvd of an old movie that I have ever seen!  The movie is around 43 years old, and to buy this movie on video through the years (as I did) was to witness a washed out, faded, and rather grainy picture.  Never having seen the movie in theaters, I took these things for fact.  The other day, I went out to buy the dvd, and when I brought it home to watch it, I was completely amazed!  The picture is vibrant, crisp, and gorgeous, and perhaps the most amazing thing is that there is not one flaw on the picture anywhere.  There is not one speck, one grain, or even the tiniest visible flaw anywhere in this movies 2 hour plus running time.  I was absolutely amazed.  Even brand new movies often have at least a few imperfections, this film transfer beats them all.  This is what dvd is all about.  Buy this one, it will stand as the crowning jewel in your collection.
B000000Y87|5.0|This album is in a class all it's own.  For me, it fits nicely alongside Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, John Coltrane's &quot;Giant Steps&quot; and &quot;My favorite things&quot;, and Herbie Hancock's &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;.  This disc is indispensible-don't wait to get it.  Bill Evans IS jazz piano in my opinion.  I love the work of many others like Tyner, Monk, Powell, and Hancock, but Evans had something about him, something about his sound.  And never is his sound more wonderfully on display than it is here.  <br />I have NEVER heard a recording with more 'feeling', more 'atmosphere' to it.  This is a live recording of Evans most famous trio in NYC in 1961.  Turn it up and listen to the chatter of the crowd in the background and the tinkle of glasses and silverware.  Breathtakingly beautiful.  LaFaro, on bass, shows himself to be a complete master of his instrument and a great songwriter as well (Gloria's Step).  JUST AS GOOD-Evans' album recorded alongside this one called &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot;.  Yeah, you should buy it too.
B000002AZX|3.0|There is little doubt that for more than thirty years, Leonard Cohen has been one of the most elegant, profound and skilled lyricists in popular music. His musical and technical knowledge, however, has always been only basic, forcing him to be dependent on producers for the sonic ambience of his work. His best collaborators include John Simon who added a fine, murky air to his classic 1968 debut, Songs of Leonard Cohen, and Sharon Robinson who engineered a gentle, computerized R&B tone for his excellent 2001 release, Ten New Songs. His worst include Phil Spector who, in typical form, overglossed and made gaudy every last second of 1979's Death of a Ladies' Man and John Lissauer who, although not as overambitious as Mr. Spector (Who is?), overproduced much of 1985's Various Positions.<br />Various Positions is often overrun with needless, often annoying, tweaks and trimmings. The two most prevalent irks are Jennifer Warnes' brassy, overdramatic crooning, which drones through \\"If It Be Your Will,\\" \\"Night Comes On\\" and \\"The Law\\" and the chintzy keyboard and synthesizer treatment that injures \\"Coming Back to You\\" and \\"Hunter's Lullaby\\" and all but ruins the lyrically dazzling \\"Hallelujah\\" (Listen to Jeff Buckley's breath taking, unaccompanied version of this song on his widely acclaimed album, Grace, to hear its true power).<br />There are some instances in which Mr. Lissauer, like Mr. Simon or Ms. Robinson, seems to understand that Mr. Cohen's weighty lyrics and stark, ontarget vocals have their own titanic presences and places the accompaniment fittingly behind the words. \\"The Captain\\" receives an appropriate, light glaze of the barroom ambience of fiddles and pianos; Mr. Cohen's brave quixotic heart leads a fine, waltzy arrangement through the excellent \\"Dance Me to the End of Love\\" and, although Ms. Warnes' ostentatious lamenting continues, a gentle sweep of ticking drums and swirling keyboards does much to enhance \\"Night Comes On.\\" Still, each song contains at least some unnecessary polish.<br />It is an especial shame that these songs have all been somewhat spoiled as they feature Mr. Cohen at his most poignant. \\"Coming Back to You\\" is his best expression of romantic desperation since \\"Bird On a Wire;\\" \\"Hunter's Lullaby\\" is a magnificently cryptic dirge; \\"The Captain\\" is a sly, easygoing musing about challenge and responsibility; \\"Night Comes On\\" is a touching, brilliant chronicle of a life cycle that is somehow both mournful and celebratory and \\"Hallelujah\\" is a inspired eulogy to one man's love and faith. Various Positions could have been a classic if only it had received proper treatment. Unfortunately, Mr. Lissauer was not right for the job.
B00004RFCM|4.0|This is a funny show, But it is very raunchy and not for the squemish or kids. I am very dispointed in the dvd though it is got a grainy, and horrbile transfer and the season pilot is almost unwathable because of this HBO you charge enough money for this set you could atleat give us a non grainy and clear transfer that is dvd quality, Disney restored Snow White and Dumbo even to crisp and clear picture and they are decades old this is a new show.The packing is also awful it smuges if you even touch it at all and the cover came off in one day. The discs were aslso near impossible to remove it took two people and one disc got smuded and scratched before it was even removed. The plus is the shows are funny and I already watched 9 of the 12 episodes in a day saving the other three for a rainy day.  SArah Jessica PArker is Radiant here and it proves she is one of the funniest and most underapreciated actress's in comedy today. I would not even buy the dvd set if I had it to do again I would buy crummy vhs the picture would be about the same without all the other problems I have had with thia set.Also If you have been watching the show reccently please relaize this season a lot raunchier and vulgar then the current one so if you are easily offended don't buy this.The deducted star is due to dvd prblems not the show it would earn a five.

B00003CXI0|3.0|This movie, I might say, is not as good as I've expected it to be. Number one, whenever you read a story, a certain image appears in your brain. You imagine and visualize what's going on and sometimes only you can like it! What on Earth do I mean? Ok, i'll tell you. When people read books, they visualize what's happening in the story. Only their visualization is good for themselves. But if you see what another person imagines, you'll mostly hate it! When I read the first novel, I really expected things to be better. I expected the Dursleys family look like what I wanted them to look like. But if I see someone else's image of the Dursleys and the Hogwarts school, i'll be very disapointed on how stupid or pathetic the scenery is. Number two, events take place the same area. When I thought of it first, I knew that every scene should be snapped shot in a different place. But I have seen a certain area snapped shot one million times. It is very obvious that someone might get bored very quickly of this. Number three, Scenes take place too quickly. This story is long, every scene must have a long amount of time but instead, the director needs to divide 1 hour and 30 minutes in 2 minutes per scene. The story will go quite fast and the details will not be able to be added on. Some details are quite as important as you might they are. Number four, Once you're half way through the story, you'll be able to know everything. Once the scene takes place in the third floor corridor near the forbiddon area, you will know that from every now and then, all three Harry, Ron and Hermoine will obviously think of plans of going inside the forbiddon area. Number five, it is obvious that in many movies, the good and poor guy becomes evil and the evil and mean guy turns out to become friendly (example, snape and quirrell). That might sum up everything I know about this movie.
0679731725|5.0|\\"Remains of the Day\\" is an incredibly understated novel.  Like an Ang Lee film, every page is bursting with passion and restraint.  Stevens is a deeply emotional, romantic person who suppresses every aspect of his \\"self\\" in a bid to achieve \\"dignity in keeping with his position.\\"  This book is a study of the idea of public and private selves, as seen through the lenses of the cultures of Japan (the author) and Great Britain (the setting).<br />There are several stories being told here; the social-political drama of the Nazis and Lord Darlington,  the fading class system of Great Britain after WWII, and the subtle romance of Stevens and Mrs. Kenton.  The first two stories and interesting on a historical level as well as a character level.  There is a sadness to Lord Darlington and to the occupants of Darlington Hall who feel a treasured way of life slipping from their fingers.<br />The third story, of Stevens and Mrs. Kenton, is deep and full of heartbreak.  Highly recommended.
B000002O5L|5.0|I had a chance to see Tom and the Heartbreakers live this past summer and once again came to appreciate how good Tom Petty is-great songs with actual melodies, evocative--if not highly intellectually challenging lyrics--an extremely emotive voice and musicianship on a high order.<br />To call this \\"light rock\\" is a bit of a misnomer--some of these tunes rock pretty well and an occasional hard edge creeps into several numbers.  But the sound never outpaces the melody, the songs are well constructed and it's evident from the word \\"go\\" that everyone involved is enjoying themselves on all of these tracks.  <br />That sense of fun is infectious. Ant the result is an album that can be plugged into the CD player and enjoyed at virtually anytime, in any mood.<br />There aren't many records like that around, which makes this a valuable commodity to have resident in the old CD holder at all times.<br />Great music!
B00005TT77|5.0|I usually would scoff at the idea of an album of Beatles covers, but the renditions featured on this terrific soundtrack to the new Sean Penn film are so lovingly and passionately rendered, they simply melt my heart. Thus far, I can't get enough of Rufus Wainwright's stunning remake of the George Harrison penned classic &quot;Across The Universe&quot; as well as other sterling contributions from Sarah McLachlan and Eddie Vedder to name a few. To me, re-recording Beatles tunes is sacred and not to be trifled with, but this collection actually manages to get it right most of the time.

B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah Carey's 3rd studio album MUSIC BOX (which was released in '93) is still awesome today. It includes the hits &quot;dreamlover&quot;, &quot;hero&quot;, &quot;anytime you need a friend&quot; and &quot;without you&quot;. Mariah's vocals are top-notch she delivers on every song. MUSIC BOX is a classic pop album filled with ballads. The dreamy &quot;dreamlover&quot; still sounds light and breezy and puts you into an instant summer vibe. The insperational &quot;hero&quot; and the haunting &quot;all i ever wanted&quot; are also standout tracks. Mariah's vocals are incredible and she does justice to each track. Her songwriting is also great. MUSIC BOX is also Mariah's biggest selling album to date with over 24 million copies sold worldwide. I remember the first time I played MUSIC BOX... I was instanly blown away by the emotional ballads. MUSIC BOX is full of great music and a must-have.

B00000JRTX|4.0|Hugh Grant shines and Andie McDowell is incandescent in this Oscar nominated tale of a bumbling English fellow, his friends, the mysterious woman he continues to encounter at various events, and in the end, a relationship that is truly written in the stars.  The comedy is deft, meaning not overwhelming, but contributes to the story in gentle, effective ways.  And the \\"funeral\\" of the title is a powerful scene as it celebrates the life of one friend who unexpectedly dies in the course of the proceedings.  That scene has been celebrated also for popularizing WH Auden's superb poem \\"Stop the Clocks\\"  a raging masterpiece that offers affection, solace and condolence in a way few works have ever done since.  In it, the character speaks Waugh's tragic words \\"He was my north, my south, my east and west My working week and my sunday best My moon, my midnight, my talk, my song I thought that love would last forever, I was wrong.\\"  A splendid note of sadness in an otherwise delicious romantic comedy.
0060506989|5.0|This is one of the best books any Vietnam veteran can have on his bookshelf.  Unfortunately, it was one of the worst experiences to have, if you got over there with the Cav during the opening years of the war.  Gen. Moore did a superb job saving the day, but it is obvious the North Vietnamese were learning about our military tactics as well as we were learning about theirs.  As Harold Moore insists at the end of the battle, nothing happened here at this moment, that didn't happen over and over again.  The NVA just hopped over into their Cambodian sanctuaries to regroup and fight us all over again.  The stories of the young officers reminded me of the many young infantry lieutenants and captains that wanted so much to get into the thick of this tropical war back in 1965; the pictures of them with their wives and children show that so much.  Who would believe it today??<br />I'm looking forward to the movie, and recommend Larry Gwin's book BAPTISM on the following days of the Ia Drang massacre which he experienced.  For me, I was glad to be a helicopter pilot in the Delta a few years later with the Outlaws, and miss all this jungle warfare with the Cav; my flight school buddies of the class of 66-14 sure didn't however.  We fleshed out the Cav with our class rather completely!
B00003CXTG|1.0|Hollywood take note, good special effects are no substitute for a quality story and good acting. A truly woeful film that had people in the theatre laughing.
031219126X|5.0|You don't know Frankenstein until you've read the novel. Forget everything you remember about the classic horror movie of Frankenstein, sure it's great cinema, but the movie just doesn't do it justice like the novel does. The novel has every quality of a perfect story, and Mary Shelley paints a picture with her writing that's far more disturbing and exciting than the movie ever was. What's really great about the book is that the creature speaks and is literate. Throughout the novel, the creature does speaks about the cruelty of man and I actually had sympathy for him as he told his accounts of misfortune.  One thing I particularly liked is the way the creature was almost invincible, it really added to the horror that his creator feels as he's chasing him through the bitter cold. The novel is not difficult reading at all and has a decent steady pace to it. There is more than meets the eye to the novel as well. One could look at Shelly's work through a psychoanalytical standpoint and see the novel on an entirely different level than just what's on the surface. Psychoanalyzing the novel brings with it some interesting discussions; for instance, is the creature really just a duplicate of its creator?  Read the book and form your own analysis, you won't be disappointed.
B000001EXR|3.0|I am a huge KISS fan and usually support every album they make even if it isn't that good which is what im doing for this one. I love almost everything KISS has done. I am just not a grunge fan at all and I didn't really like the sound of KISS making a grunge album. Sure it is always good for a band to switch directions and go for a new sound but I just don't think KISS made the right turn here in this case. This music just isn't they're style. If you are a fan of grunge music and a fan of KISS then you pretty much have it made with this album. If you are a fan like me in which you love KISS but aren't a fan of grunge you will still buy this alum showing your support for KISS and listen to it every now and then but keep rocking to Rock And Roll Over, Creatures Of The Night, Love Gun, Destroyer and albums of that kind. There are some really good songs on here and KISS worked hard on this album which I like alot. I am happy they put they're efforts into it and tryed hard to make an album I didnt like rather then just make music in a lazy weak style to just release something. Some of the songs on here are very powerful and there are some really good songs like \\"It Never Goes Away\\", \\"I Confess\\", and \\"Rain\\". This just isn't my style of KISS. Psycho Circus however which was the bands reunion album with the original 4 is an excellent album. As far as this album goes i'll rank it with \\"Music From 'The Elder'\\" an ocassional listen to.

B0000069NM|5.0|Forget about the other Sco and MMW albums, and try to listen objectively.  Take this CD for what it is, and let the music speak for itself.  That said, these guys playing together are a MONSTER band.  Seriously, and supernaturally, gifted, and as tight as any of the great bands, jazz or non-jazz.  Sco perfectly complements MMW, and they him (frankly, I think the whole &quot;organ trio&quot; wears a bit thin after awile).  Everybody is ON. Everybody is telepathic.  This is one of those absolutely unique albums that will stand the test of time and go down as a definitive work.  50 years from now, it will be rediscovered and revered.  Solos:mind bending     Song writing:brilliant<BR>Naysayers: get real  Don't try to classify, just take this music for what it is: a pinnacle.

B00005RFAI|5.0|While Pink was stuffed under the teen R&B category for her first album Can't take me Home, any negative critic would be crazy or delusional to try to say she is following the same path this time around for M!ssundaztood. She really lets out her true talents for music and she is 10x bolder than she was two years ago. Want a diverse Cd with many different types of songs?

B00005O3VC|5.0|M.P. & The Holy Grail is a very inventive low-budget comedy, shot on location in Scotland.  To compensate for a lack of horses and/or equestrian ability, the knights skip and hop along to a backbeat of clapping coconut shells.  In their search for the Grail they encounter strange & terrible creatures, odd Frenchmen ensconced in Scottish castles, some pretty girls, British \\"bobbies,\\" an avaricious landowner, several knights of obscure purposes and a warlock named Tim.  <br />The film is a series of isolated \\"sketches\\" loosely strung together with animated sequences or simple captions.  As is true for many great comedies, there is no proper ending to this film, dramatically speaking.  The Life of Brian is a step forward for Monty Python in that respect.  But Holy Grail has some of the most ridiculously funny hair-splitting logic serving as \\"dialogue,\\" and its slightly daft intellectual atmosphere is  unique even among Python's other works.  <br />My DVD does not flash English subtitles after I've switched them off, but let the buyer beware; maybe some initial pressings were defective.  Certainly there are Swedish subtitles beneath the opening credits, but they're part of the original negative -- not to be turned off.  Whatever the case, there are hours of \\"extras\\" and 2 separate \\"commentaries\\" to play during the film, and I'm very happy with the Special Edition.  You get two discs for the price of one, more or less, and the \\"extras\\" really are worth delving into.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film is one of the best experience I had the pleasure of having in the year 2001.  Too many crowd pleasers come out, clouding the theater with fluff.  This film is challeging, the best films are challeging, such as another 2001 release starting with M[emento].  Its a twisted story which can make sense when the person watching uses their brain.  This is just a shot from the hip, I have only seen it once.  I love this movie, I know I'll still love it years from now, because it hasn't left my head, I haven't solved the COMPLETE puzzle. Even if I do, perhaps Your view will be a different than what I thought it meant.  See this film and join the elite which don't mind being played with and always having to wonder.<BR>This is the type of film that film students should have to watch.<BR>The acting is great and the characters are unusually deep.<BR>Lynch's best!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is awesome!  I am completely and udderly in love with this movie, the songs rock, the cast rocks, the dancing rocks, everything rocks! Baz is a genius, you have to buy this movie!!!  Warning though, if you suffer from panic attacks you  might want a glass of water to drink with you or a friend to watch with you the first time.  The cinematography messes with your mind.
0345413377|5.0|I approached this book with trepidation, for fear that it would be a let down from the first two in the trilogy.  It did not disappoint.  All the credit in the world belongs to Pullman for not treating his young audience like morons.  Aside from the philosophical questions he poses this series stand on its own as a thrilling fantasy.
B000002GC2|5.0|I bought the vinyl edition in 1982 after stinching the money from my meager army pay &amp; the music was worth every cent of it! Every track is beautifully composed &amp; Qince took almost every one of the new artistes in the album to world recognition: James Ingram, Patti Austin. 10 years later when CDs were the rave and the turn-table became a forgotten accompaniment of my childhood momentos,I bought the CD with my 2nd month's pay after graduation. 2 weeks ago after getting tired with Robbie Williams and Vertical Horizon, I put The Dude into the CD changer of my car &amp; as the music played, it seemed almost like yesterday that I was a young chap starting out in life again swinging to the sound of Quincy Jones.  Michael Jackson, stop trying to do rock &amp; roll your way!  You should know how good you sounded when you were doing Rock with You and Off the Wall.  Quince, you're the best!!
B00003CXXO|5.0|It is a time when natural resources are limited and technology is advancing at an astronomical pace. Where you live is monitored; what you eat is engineered; and the person serving you is not a person at all. It's artificial. Gardening, housekeeping, companionship -- there is a robot for every need. Except love. <br />Much of this movie is dark. At one point, a hopelessly depressed David leaps from the top of a skyscraper. And it grows unnervingly frustrating, especially as Spielberg's script tries to reach a conclusion that always seems just beyond reach. Spielberg wants a happy ending filled with hope. The ending? An anticlimax, but hopelessly touching. I felt tears streaming down my cheeks, and I don't cry easily.<br />Hayley Joel Osment is simply out of the world. Such talent for acting is rare, and for a child to deliver with such emotional intensity is rarer. <br />Go see this film. What goes around comes around in a film that was hated by the critics, criticised by viewers, but essentially loved by me. It is a moral story of love in a world where love cannot exist.
0790729725|3.0|Goodfellas is one of the best movies of all time, but it's dvd layout is very poor.  it is 2 sided, meaning you have to get up in the middle of the movie and turn it to the other side, which is very distracting. also there are almost no special features.  if it wasnt for these two faults i would give it 5 stars, but it the faults took away from my viewing experience
B00005RZV4|4.0|I was fortunate enough to see NIN on this tour, at the Portland, OR show - it was one of the most powerful and intense concerts I've been to, and this CD does an excellent job of capturing the energy that I felt pouring off the stage that night.  It's one of the better live recordings I've heard (not quite as good as Tool's &quot;Salival&quot; album, but close) and, unlike many live recordings, the vocals are crystal-clear.  There's a good variety of songs from different albums, and all of them feel somehow more &quot;explosive&quot; and heavier than the studio versions.  &quot;Terrible Lie&quot;, &quot;Sin&quot; and &quot;Wish&quot; were highlights for me.<BR>I bought the 2 CD set, and I have to say that while the second disc was interesting (I especially liked the acoustic version of &quot;The Becoming&quot;) it was also a little disappointing.  Maybe because it was so hyped that I was expecting something REALLY special, and in fact a good portion of the material on it was vaguely interesting and not much more...it just didn't grab me.  However, I would still recommend it for serious NIN fans.  If you're on a budget, though, you might want to just get the first disc.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Pearl Harbor is without a doubt the phoniest excuse to make a huge blockbuster movie which is exactly what Michael Bay and Bruckheimmer did. Before this movie came out, they were saying such things as \\"We want to honor the survivors of Pearl Harbor\\" and garbage like that. If anyone who survived Pearl Harbor saw this version, I think they would be insulted. Pearl Harbor is ripoff combination of Titanic's love story and Independence Day and Armaggedon's special effects, though nowhere near as good as any of these movies. The acting among the 3 main stars are average at best. Cuba Gooding Jr. being in this movie was ridiculous because he had absolutely no role. He was just used for star power and a poor excuse to put a black actor in the movie. Just a waste of a good talent. The movie is excrutiatingly long, well over 3 hrs. It obviously tried to copy the Titanic effect. The music was way too overdramatic, made you laugh at times. The bombing sequence which was probably a good half hour was very impressive. If that's all you're interested in then you'll get your money's worth. It was obviously the only part of the film that the directors focused on. The other 2 1/2 hrs were just thrown in. The screenplay was laughable as well. There were no memorable lines at all and it made you scratch your head that the guy who wrote Braveheart did the screenplay for this. Anyone who can watch this movie straight without complaint, my hat goes off to you.

B000002GQK|5.0|In my reviews so far I have praised EGBDF<br />several times, in order to put other groups efforts into perspective. I own the best five of the seven classic Moody Blues albums (produced between 1967 and 1973), the exceptions being \\"Threshold of a dream\\" (mediocre) and \\"Seventh Sejourn\\" (apparently poor vinyl -> CD transfer). Incredible but true, among these five great albums there is still one that manages to stand above the others, and that's \\"Every good boy deserves favour\\"! A bit unfortunate for the first time listener, the opening \\"Procession\\" is somewhat less accessible than the second track \\"The story in your eyes\\" which is included in most hit compilations. There is NO WEAK TRACK  on this album (see footnote), specially the last five from \\"After you came\\" to \\"My song\\" are pure magic. No other band has ever managed to combine great tunes, challenging the Beatles best, with such a bite and rythm. Among my several hundred CD's (mostly 70's rock, prog. or not) EGBDF is actually M y__N u m b e r__O n e<br />(albeit followed closely by a couple of others)! I recommend to listen to EGBDF at high volume whilst looking at some intriguing picture (say of Raquel Welsh or, if not available, the cover art of EGBDF). The combination of sound and vision adds to the enjoyment.<br />footnote: For a while I did not appreciate \\"Procession\\" and the<br />heavy middle part of \\"My song\\" so much. But now I relish them both!
1577311523|5.0|E.T. has done a rather splendid job of illustrating the very essence of how to live a fantastic life as a human being.  Read the Power of Now, plunge into reality, and remove your fanny from that dreary treadmill, often disguised as a glamorous catwalk. Cease to be a full time human doer worrying & fussing about EVERYTHING, and instead simply embrace \\"being\\" a human being in the truest sense of the word, and the world.  Right. Well then. Good. Okey-dokey. Enough said, what? Sehr gut geschrieben Herr Tolle.  Sie haben etwas drauf.<BR>tbh
B000002OTL|4.0|This is a great song, probably the second greatest song ever to feature whistling (the first being Dock of the Bay).  Maria McKee's solo career has been spotty at best, but this is one of her finest tracks.<br />Pulp Fiction was a fun movie, and there is some other good music here, but this song alone makes it worth the price.
B00005UEAR|2.0|Unlike the powerful musical genius of \\"Awake\\" and \\"Falling into Infinity\\" this is a release that definitely doesn't follow suit. There are few instrumental runs that are remniscent of the progressive intensity that Dream Theater is renowned for. Most songs don't commit themselves to memory even after continual re-play; the lyrical content reinforces the stale \\"insanity\\" theme that has been \\"done to death\\" by other artists. Engineering and production are mastered to the usual Dream Theater perfection -- but artistic musical passion and driving force are noticeably absent. The two CD-set could have been \\"spliced down\\" to a more memorable single CD.
B000002IQW|5.0|How can you say this is not as good as their debut? This album is twice as good as their debut album. The lyrics have more thought, the music is more complex, and songs like slave to the grind at breakneck speed really show off their skill. This album doesn't have a weak song on it, and it's one of those albums you can pop in and listen to straight though. This album is right up there with van halen I or GnR appetite for destruction in terms of hard rock albums. There isn't a weak link in the band, and that's what makes the songs shine. If you listen to appetite for destruction, it's obvious steven adler (the drummer) is the one holding them back, but not here. This album rocks hard and consistently. A very underrated album in my book.
B000001ELB|5.0|It's hard to belive that a hard rock band like kiss made such a beautiful recording like the song Beth. The song really comes from the heart. The radio station should play this song more often.
B00005UEAR|3.0|The album isn't bad, it's just not great either. I agree 100% with the other reviewers who have stated Mike Portnoy should really put down the pen, stop trying sing (or at least get a vocal coach) and just play the drums. His lryic style is best suited for very long songs, with A Change of Seasons being his only true great work. Petrucci is the best writer the band has (at this moment) and I don't mind his style (Hallow Years and Solitary Shell are fantastic for what they are), but Kevin Moore was really the one who brought in the incredible lryic composition element. His keyboard playing may not be as incredible as Jordans, but his lryic writing was masterful and complemented the complex musical compositions perfectly. There was also a magic between John Petrucci and Kevin, the two felt the songs the same way and sometimes you could actually confuse the guitar and keyboard parts. That missing element has prevented these guys from releasing another Images &amp; Words. I think SFAM was a long over due album that turned out great (even with Kevins absense), but it would have been even more incredible with him behind the pen. <br />Three stars, because it does have some sweet points: Jordan's playing is ear candy, James really makes use of his range on a few tracks, aside from that the rest of the band perform about as expected.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Well, it's still early in the year, so that statement is a bold one, but this could very well be the best album of 2002.  The only thing I know of that will come along this year that may even come close is Iced Earth's cover album.  This has everything a Dream Theater fan could want.  Over 90 minutes of brilliance.  Many are saying this is their best album yet.  I don't know about that, but it certainly delivers.  It starts with \\"The Glass Prison\\", possibly their heaviest song yet.  14 minutes of pure metal.  At certain points in this song, you'd swear you were listening to Testament from \\"The Gathering\\", or something.  Great, great stuff.  The next song, \\"Blind Faith\\", is much softer.  It's more of a power ballad, with some really nice keyboard work from Jordan.  \\"Misunderstood\\" is another great song, starting off with an acoustic intro, and building into a sludgy, Alice in Chains type riff.  Nice chorus on this one.  \\"The Great Debate\\", as mentioned before, is very much like Tool.  But, there's also a lot of DT in there as well.  It almost sounds like the both of them jamming together.  Mike does a combo of the weird, Danny Carey style drumming, mixed with his normal superfast style, and James almost sounds like Maynard at times.  Very interesting.  I hope the Toolheads understand that this was an homage, not a ripoff.  I and a lot of other DT fans would rather not see \\"they ripped off Tool\\" in every review.  Good song, but a little too long.  Kinda reminds you why Tool doesn't do 14-minute songs very often.  The last song, \\"Disappear\\", isn't that great.  It's too slow, and it never really goes anywhere.  This is one of the few songs that James LaBrie wrote.<br />Okay, now onto the good part.  The second disc consists of the title track, a 42-minute song.  However, it spans 8 tracks, so it can't be given credit as longest song ever (and Fates Warning's \\"Pleasant Shade of Gray\\" is still longer).  But wow, good stuff.  Can you say diverse?  Compare the insane heaviness of \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" to the uplifting acoustics of \\"Solitary Shell\\".  Can you believe that's the same song?  Great lyrics too, though I haven't figured them out yet.  There's a boy and a girl, and something about insanity, I think.  Mike's lyrics are probably the creepiest of the song (especially \\"Test..\\" and \\"Goodnight Kiss\\").  He and John each wrote different parts of it.  They really work well together.  This can't touch the brilliance of \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" (but then compare the 42 minutes to the 77), but it makes for a quick and enjoyable listen.<br />This is a very solid, and diverse album.  Well, track 5 isn't great, but it hardly brings the album down.  All the musicians are in fine form, (John's solos are much more interesting these days), and James puts on a great vocal performance, as usual.  This is generally a pretty dark album (even moreso than \\"Awake\\"), but the title track does have some very pleasant, uplifting moments.  Very poetic lyrics, too.  It isn't better than SFAM (IMO, nothing is, and probably ever will be), but it's a must-have for the fans.  Album of the year?

B000002UAX|4.0|Let's face it, the Beatles were simply incapable of making a bad album, but the praise heaped upon this one strays from reality.  There are some truly great songs on this album.  There is also a lot of filler, and some outright junk (Revolution Number 9 apologists take note).<br />It is not the greatest album of all time.  It is not the greatest rock album of all time.  It is not even the greatest Beatles album of all time.  It is very good, and worth buying.
B0000025YL|5.0|Accept were and are one of the greatest and most underrated Metal bands of all time, and Restless and Wild is their masterpiece. As a kid in the early eighties I was a true metal head into the likes of Sabbath, Scorps, Priest and Maiden, but my whole world took a turn for the HEAVIER when I was kicked in the face by the double bass onslaught of Fast as a Shark! Metal had taken an evolutionary step towards true aggression and somehow everything else seemed a little tamer in comparison. These german metal maestroes captured everything that makes metal so appealing in my book, true musicianship,power, precision, touches of classical/gothic melody that doesen't deplete the noize factor,lyrics that exalt a rude and crude roughneck metal ethic(Ahead of the Pack,title track) vague occultic mysticism (Princess of the Dawn, Demon's Night) and balls out beer swilling anthems (Get Ready, Flash Rockin Man). This is pure blood & guts street level metal with no time for sissy poser wannabes, all filtered through an obviously foreign (german/european) sensibility thankfully devoid of american style concessions to glamor and rock stardom! Despite some opinions to the contrary Udo's vocals are a perfect compliment to the sound and lyrics. His audio and physical lack of beauty may have kept Accept from achieving \\"stardom\\" but in my opinion kept them perfectly on track as far as the aesthetics and ethics of true metal go. Accept remain today as they were then, obscure at best outside metal circles, and a joke to music snobs who don't know any better, but that's O.K. only the faithful have a right to know anyway...
B0000019PA|5.0|In-freaking-credible.  After listening to this album only a handful of times, I told my girlfriend that it was undoubtedly one of the best records I'd ever heard.  But, rather than trying to describe how good this music is (impossible), I've decided to give potential listeners a few of my other favorite bands as reference points to help determine whether you'd like NMH or not.  I always find it helpful when people mention other bands they like so I can determine if their taste and mine overlap.  So here goes:<br />Some of my favorite bands:  Built to Spill, Guided by Voices, Pavement, Modest Mouse, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Archers of Loaf, Nothing Painted Blue, Tom Petty, The Pixies, The Smiths, Promise Ring, Bruce Springsteen.<br />Currently listening to:  The Shins, The Strokes, Beulah, The Pernice Brothers, Sigur Ros, The Dismemberment Plan.<br />Hope that helps!
630264366X|5.0|This is one of the best WWII movies I have seen. Gregory Peck is absolutely wonderfull and this is the perfect roll for him. I loved it.
B00005J73X|5.0|Ok I will cut to the chase. I am a diehard Joviaddict. When this cd came out I was in the store that day to purchase it. This cd sums up a live show in no uncertain terms. As Jon said about the release they wanted it to be a &quot;snapshot&quot; of what there live shows are like. The sound quality is awesome. This just goes to show that these boys from Jersey , can still wipe up the floor better then any rock band from that era. Could this be why they are still here pleasuring us all with their blend of Heartfelt music and Talent????????  All the non believers need to get with the program. By this cd....I tell you....you will believe.
6304140711|5.0|Mark Wahlberg plays David who is obsessed with a 16 year old girl,who is clean cut todays girl. He doesn't get along with daddy to well and will stop at nothing to get Nicole back. Even if that means to kill her family. Mark Wahlberg keeps me on the edge of my seat. Reese Witherspoon is a sweet girl in this film. I can't stop watching this movie. This movie is worth watching over and over again.
0671775308|5.0|I've read Rich Dad - Poor Dad, The Richest Man in Babylon, and this clearly blows them out of the water.  This book explains how common everyday people make their millions...not the movie stars.<br />It talks about how some are \\"appearing wealthy\\" to keep up with the Jones' or their 'great profession' (i.e. attorney, doctor, etc) but have very little NET WORTH - or CATTLE as described in the book.  <br />I'll read it at least 3 more times this year to keep the principles fresh in my mind.  LOVED IT!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I have rarely enjoyed an ENTIRE CD as much as this one.  Although my roots are in Kentucky I have never been a great fan of bluegrass music but this movie changed everything for me.  When I saw the movie I knew I had to have the CD immediately!  The songs are enchanting, haunting and mesmerizing.  The main song, &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; will just get in your head and refuse to leave.  It is incredibly addictive.  &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby&quot; is haunting yet reaches down to your soul.  You can certainly understand why the sirens got the response they did from Pete in the movie.<br />Even if you aren't a fan of this particular genre you might want to give this CD a chance.  It just might get into your blood and change your point of view forever.
B00000K3D4|1.0|the only people who will enjoy this are Bowie fans I guess and I'm not one of them.<BR>The Muppets are funny, this is not. Maybe suitable for a 9 year old who likes fluffy things prancing about but then you have the teletubbies for that....<BR>I guess that the only thing that stops me using all the explitives that I should be writing here is the thought that this was meant for children....<BR>Maybe that's how it got the 5 star rating - by eliminating the rude reviews...
B00004Z459|5.0|Limp bizkit with star fish gave numetal such a bad name.  But ppl shouldnt judge linkin park for what fred durst did.  THis is an absolute gem.  NO fillers, for one, all songs are great, even the dj instrumental track 11.  Rock, fused with rap, electro guitars, scratches, keyboards, and a luscious techno sound makes Hybrid Theory such a great listen.  ALthough the lyrics are not overly fantastic, they are nevertheless exceptional and better than most rap rock groups out there.  Most songs are leaned toward the heavy end, but also melodramic, its a nice balance.  And Bennington's voice is great, and Shinoda's rapping, again, not overly fantastic, but exceptional.  Overall, the entire 12 tracks are just very easy to listen to and very easy for anyone to like.  And b4 you know it, you'll humming IN tHe end, ONe step closer, or Crawling in your car.  And all songs are very catchy.  ALl 3 singles so far are worthy of made videos.  I would love to see either Pushing me away or Forgottn to be the next single.  no doubt about it, 5 stars all the way.  This album is almost flawless.  Short, but to the point, and top notched quality.  ANd please download songs like Step up and carousel, which were unreleased songs from their EP, they are great as well.  ONly way linkin park can screw up now is to mess up their sophomore effort, which we shall wait and see, in the meantime, they are the best rock band in the world.
0451527712|3.0|If you like horror, then this book is one you should strongly consider reading.  Forget about your \\"ideas\\" of Frankenstein from the movies, and instead focus on the life of a man who plays god.  Dr. Victor Frankenstein who creates a living human being all by himself.  But, who would of thought that when the creature would awake, Victor's creation would turn out to be a horrible monster that even Victor himself rejects.<br />The story opens in the frozen Arctic wastes during a sea-going expedition to find a passage through the ice to the East. Aboard the ship after a strange meeting, Frankenstein tells his story. As a young man he wanted to find ways to create bigger and better things in the sciences, and indeed figured out a way to create life. Having done so, he became alienated from the world, which left significant consequences for both Frankenstein and his creation. The two interact closely throughout the book, sometimes almost like twin brothers (in one sense as if the monster was a form of Victor) and like Creator and creation in another.<br />While the monster's appearance frightens many he is still merely just human, and desires like all other humans for anyone's understanding, and loving to fulfill his need to be accepted.  The theme of friendship and ambitions can be seen, and the conflict of each of these difference shows through each of Victor and his creations appearances with each other.<br />This novel is memorable due to its depth, mood, descriptions of Victor's creation, and mostly of the dark, cold truth telling of the real monsters within others, and not just necessarily in Dr. Frankenstein's creature.<br />This book may present some significant challenges to its reader's.  The novel seems to take a long time to develop each of it's specific points, so patience is required to go through layer after layer in hopes of being able to see the underlying picture of the story told.<br /><br />Why, give the book three stars instead of five?  The awkwardness of the story was an annoying setback, but well worth the read.  While many may not fail to be drawn back by this, it was something that made it harder to push through.  While the style of the book moves and develops extremely slowly, just when you feel nothing could happen, it does!  That is what makes the book go on, and the reader becomes satisfied.<br />After you have had a chance to absorb and appreciate the consequences of this book you find you are then asking yourself how you yourself relate with others.  Then you start to examine future potential consequences you might make.  This book can help you in a way to think about your actions before you take them, and make your decisions more worthwhile.ess of the story was an annoying setback, but well worth the read.

B00000JRTX|4.0|A very beautifully told tale of British marital angst that only occasionally falters.  <br />The performances are all very good - no faltering there.  And the inclusion of Auden's poem &quot;Funeral Blues&quot; and the reading John Hannah (I think that is the actor's name) gives it are superb.  <br />The only real drawback to the story involves the development of Andie MacDowell's character.  Her character is too unevenly drawn.  A long --------- very long, excruciatingly long --------- courtship would be the only way to go with someone as flighty and mixed up as her character is in this movie.  <br />Other than that, it is a very clever and interesting film.
B00005QG9J|3.0|i am not a huge incubus fan although i think fungus amongus and science are both brilliant albums!  i have tried listening to this album a few times and just haven't been able to get into it at all really!  i mean theres a few good songs, but compared to the other albums i mentioned it's crap!  if you are a big incubus fan you are obviously gonna buy this, if you are just catching up with incubus, which im sure is happening now they have become a lot more mainstream recently especially with the wussy 'wish you were here' then buy their early albums first!  still worth a listen though!
B00003CX5P|2.0|This movie was almost --- almost ------- as disappointing as \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  Both are mere shadows of what they could have been had more attention been devoted to the crafting and telling of the story and less concern been devoted to making easy to digest summer blockbusters.<br />By any real standard, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" doesn't belong as a part of the Star Wars family of movies.  The choice of actors is off the mark.  The fight scenes and action sequences are not nearly as thoughtfully staged as they were in the original trilogy.  And worst of all, the storytelling is flat.  Keen storytelling with good special effects trumps a thin story and excellent special effects every time.  The latter is what makes a summer blockbuster.  The former is what makes a classic.  My hope is that Lucas will invest more time into refining the storytelling in Episode II and obsess less over the CGI and pyrotechnics. <br />On a similar note, less of the hyperactive shifting back and forth between action scenes and smoothing out the editing and letting the scenes evolve a bit more slowly would also be improvements that would serve Episode II well.  But that may not be much of a consideration or possibility in light of how much the average attention span in our society has shrunk in the 25 or so years since the first Star Wars.<br />Bottom line: Episode One was shoddy.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I'm still amazed by all the bad press that this movie receives. For anyone who loved the original trilogy, there is no way that you will not enjoy this film.<BR>  Granted, the film doen't measure up to A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back, but it is certainly enjoyable, and in my mind, superior to Return of the Jedi. The main problem with the film is Jar Jar. He is more annoying than the Ewoks in ROTJ, and lacks the intrigue of Chewbacca. But honestly, from the pod race scene on, he becomes a background character. Sure, he still plays a role in the end battle scene, but you don't really mind him here, as the action and special effects overshadow his annoying voice and clumsiness.<BR>  Another major complaint is young Anakin, played by Jake Lloyd. Give me a break, people! He's supposed to be a cute, innocent child who loves and misses his mom - and he plays this role convincingly.<BR>  Lastly, people complain about the droids. Sure, they lack the &quot;coolness&quot; of stormtroopers, but let's remember, this takes place quite a few years before ANH. It's fun looking at the droids, the ships, and yes, the whole Trade Federation plot, and seeing how all these things evolved and influenced the universe as we're used to seeing it in the other films.<BR>  As for the dvd, the special features alone are worth the cost. It is currently the best made, fully-packed dvd on the market.<BR>  Give the movie a chance, and see it for what it is - the start of the greatest science fiction story ever told. Give Mr. Lucas a break, and judge the saga as a whole. I guarantee, he knows what he's doing, and when it's all said and done with, he will not disappoint!
B00003CXZ4|2.0|I had the same reaction to the ending of this film as I did to \\"The Usual Suspects\\" --- disappointment, the type of disappointment you get when you know you've been fleeced.  Except this film started to fall apart for me much sooner than \\"The Usual Suspects\\" did --- but, hey, I was younger then &amp; if I was to watch TUS for the first time now, I'm sure things in that film would fall apart for me earlier on now than they did then ---- at least I'd hope so.<br />This film is too taken with its own cleverness.  And, gosh, is it repetitive!!  <br />Save yourself the disappointment and wait for the rerun of that Seinfeld episode where they basically run the story in reverse --- the one where they go to India for a wedding and backtrack the story from there. . . . . .  That Seinfeld episode, annoying as it was, is much less so than Memento, and at least compensates you with the occasional laugh.  Memento doesn't.<br />In Sum: My poor wittle conventional mind doewsn't wikey all wof this thinking outside the box.  Da pain wof a new idea was too much for mwy wittle head to take.  :)<br />A suitable alternative to this (and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;) --- ?  Try &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; ---- a much more philosophically interesting and satisfying film.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Stanley Kubrick, the director of such masterpieces as A CLOCKWORK ORANGE or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, brings a brilliantly funny black comedy about the cold war. About a crazed military officer who orders planes to wrongly bomb Russia, this film will be forever remember. MUST be seen for all classic film buffs
B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber made the Beethoven 5th and 7th symphonies a one horse race for all the myriad of recordings that have been done by various conductors and orchestras.  This is, by far, the best of this duo you are likely to get.<br />Oh, you are a collector and you say you already have nine recordings of the 5th already? Well, you surely need one more... THIS ONE!  GET IT!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|We could only wish that every retelling of La Traviata were as delightful as this one.  High tragedy blends with all the wit and charm of the movie musical in an impossibly brilliant marriage. A deceptively simple tale, Moulin Rouge begins with a kaleidoscope view of Lurhman's color drenched Monmarte. But at its heart is Satin, a diamond who dazzles in her defiant redefining of  &quot;Truth, Freedom, Beauty and Love&quot;.  The film playfully draws on theatrical convention, reworking classics to create a new Violetta.  It disparate elements harmonize in magic unison creating a visual extravaganza that rewards re-viewing.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|First,some songs from the movie disappeared, like &quot;like a virgin&quot;,&quot;The show must go on&quot; ...<BR>Second,Nicole doesn't sing well.She is an actress,not a singer.Ewan is not bad,though not very good.<br />2 stars for &quot;Nature Boy&quot; and &quot;Le Tango de Roxanne&quot;
0517122707|5.0|This is the greatest book ever.  Truly a masterpiece. Sad to know that John Kennedy Toole committed suicide over his depression when he could not get it published, then his mother took on the quest, got it published posthumously, and it won the Pulitzer Prize!  I have read most of the Pulitzer books, and this is one that really truly deserves it.  Read it, you will certainly be well entertained.
0440219078|5.0|I especially liked how the book was written.  I like the point of view.  The Giver, like 1984, gives an impression of what the future could be like.  In The Giver Jonas is selected as the Reciever of Memory.  This position give him the training to get all of the memories that the other people of the community don't have.  The others don't have feelings, can't see color, and everything is planned out.  Jonas decides that he wants to be free of the community and go to the \\"elsewhere\\".  He steals the child that his family was caring for and escapes.  He does this without preperation bacause the child was scheduled for release, to be killed, the following day.  This almost cost them their lives.  At the end of the book Jonas finds the sled in his memory and slide down the hill.
B00003CXTF|5.0|'Pearl Harbor' was a nice surprise to me. I had seen some bad reviews and thought it would be a terrible movie. But I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched it several times for a number of reasons. First of all, the action scenes are fantastic. The movie is slow-paced at first and builds up to the action, but it held my attention. The scenery and the musical scores were lovely, very impressive. The love triangle, although a bit syrupy, was something most women will eat up. Men, on the other hand, will probably be annoyed. But I have to say that I could not believe how adorable Ben Affleck and Josh Hartneck are. Gorgeous does not really do enough to describe these hunks. Josh Hartneck, especially, will leave a definate impression with most women. I haven't seen men that look like this in movies for many years. And there is one love scene with Josh and Kate Beckinsale that left me speechless. Does the movie have faults? Probably, but who cares..I loved it.
B00003CY0V|1.0|this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long, long time.<BR>Travolta and the others should be ashamed to have appeared in this disaster.
B00005JCA9|5.0|I thought the chemistry between Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts was very genuine.  I thoroughly enjoyed this pleasant, funny movie and have watched it over and over.  Sure it's predictable, but isn't that kind of a nice change in today's world?  The soundtrack is great too!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I like this CD because I love the movie.  When I hear the songs, I remember specific points in the movie and I replay them in my mind's eye.  That's the best part of a movie soundtrack, especially a MUSICAL movie soundtrack.  Sadly, not enough of this music is taken directly from the movie.  For instance, &quot;NATURE BOY&quot; sung by David Bowie on the CD is different from the way it's performed in the movie. (I don't know who sings it in the movie's opening number.)  Plus, many other songs, from memorable scenes in the movie, are conspicuously missing from the CD (such as, &quot;THE SHOW MUST GO ON&quot;).  <br />I understand a second soundtrack is to be released in the next few weeks (MOULIN ROUGE 2).  Perhaps the good stuff will be there.  I certainly hope so.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Of course critics abound when a new movie in a series comes out.  I tired to watch this movie as a stand alone and thought it was enjoyable.  The storyline kept me going, the set design was awesome, and the Williams score was good.  Overall, I enjoyed it and have seen it several times.
0375703764|5.0|I have to say this is the first book I have ever read that made my heart beat helplessly, in broad daylight!  Granted, some people are not going to understand the intricacies in writing and storytelling that Danielewski has shown us here, but this is a marvel of a novel.  Danielewski not only overlaps and collides two very different worlds, he brings together such real characters and personifies the true power of darkness. I was entranced by this novel and cannot wait for the next!
B00005K3OT|4.0|The set and music really made the movie.  Juliette Binoche was wonderful as well as Judi Dench (who can do no wrong).  The soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated and adds to the movement of the film.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I would actually give this 3.5 stars, but I can't justify bumping it to the higher value of 4 stars.  <br />I really wanted to like this, but the thing I kept asking myself during this movie was \\"was there a screenplay written for this thing??\\".  But the movie was so hell-bent on frenetic editing that even if there was a screeplay, it didn't matter anymore!  I could forgive the filmmakers if they hadn't *tried* so dang hard.  (Watch \\"Taxi Driver\\" for an excellent example of being real, gritty, and powerful without having to beat you over the head with it.  This movie is an insult to any adult's intelligence.)  <br />But the biggest flaw in this film was the fact that the characters were badly underdeveloped.  This is a serious problem when your film is supposed to be a character study (wait, what WAS the purpose of this movie?).  This serious flaw becomes even more obvious when you don't have a brilliant cast to pick up the slack in the writing.  But, I'm being more forgiveable here because Mr. Aronofsky did score big-time in getting Ellen Burstyn to play the leading role.  She saves it from becoming a complete mess.  For 20 years now I have been saying that Ellen Burstyn is easily among the top 5 actresses of her generation.  That cannot be argued (with me, that is).  She doesn't have a huge list of film credits, but she's given some of the finest performances ever captured on film:  \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\", \\"The King Of Marvin Gardens\\", \\"Resurrection\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"The Last Picture Show\\", \\"Same Time, Next Year\\", etc. etc.  She's brilliant, and she is remarkable here, and her strength as an actress is what holds it together.  But the rest of the cast cannot make heads or tails with this script, and it shows.  <br />Jared Leto, first of all, cops probably the worst New York accent I've ever heard on film.  It's so bad that I either have to laugh or cringe during the many moment he \\"toughens\\" up his accent (usually whenever he raises his voice).  But his dullness otherwise seems fitting for playing a drugged out slacker, but it's still a dreadful performance.  Jennifer Connelly may or may not be good; heck, I don't know, because I don't know a stinking thing about her character.  Ditto for Marlon Wayans (and what's up with that girlfriend?  she just disappears from the movie.  why bring her out in the first place?).  <br />To top things off, the movie barrels into a noisy 15 minute finale that is laughable and ludicrously WAY over the top.  It takes everything to a total extreme (this side of having everyone die), but to say what, exactly?  Shock therapy, amputation, prison, and degrading sex acts for money (and degrading is an understatement for what happens at the end, by the way).  If I felt the movie had taken me somewhere before the finale, then maybe it wouldn't be so ridiculous.  Even the one character that you kind of get to know--Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb--is pushed into a situation way WAY over the edge of credibility.  It's downright laughable.  <br />I say this is strictly for the kids because I can hear them saying \\"whoa, this is [messed] up, man!\\".  Some of us grown-ups, however, will just sit there rolling our eyes.  It is clear evidence of the influence of technology and MTV on popular moviemaking.  I do have to give the filmmakers some kudos for creativity, but they also made this film seem like too much of an experiment.  <br />One other good thing I can say about this is the music score by Kronos Quartet.  It's very chilling, and was a nice surprise since I had feared this movie would have a noisy techno or hip-hop score (which it does at times).  But their bass-heavy strings help keep the atmosphere of the film from going completely over the edge.
0451527712|1.0|The big monster with bolts sticking out of his neck, little vocabulary, frightening everybody in his path.  He is brought to life in a spooky laboratory with lightning flashing and the mad scientist hovering over him with the joy of accomplishment.  This is what we think of when we hear the name Frankenstein.  I would like to tell you the book was this exiting, but I can't.  The first problem with this story was it's very slow pace.  You find yourself looking ahead to see if any action or \\"horror\\" (since it is called a \\"horror story\\") is coming up.  And why do they call it a \\"horror story\\"?  The most horrific scenes in the book are when the monster kills somebody, and you could always see them coming from a mile away.  One more reason I believe this book is worthy of a low rating is the unbelievable nature of the story.  I know that it's a fictional story, but at least make the characters act somewhat realistic.  For example, when Victor leaves his wife alone in bed on their honeymoon, it never even crosses his mind that the monster might kill her.  Or the fact the monster has super human strength, speed, and quickness.  How does a gathering of dead limbs and organs produce super human strength?<br /> I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 40.  It's pace is way too slow for the modern worlds fast pace and it leaves you wondering, \\"Why didn't I just watch the movie\\".
0780020685|4.0|Just about everyone and their mother hails this movie as STUPENDOUS, FANTASTIC, MIND NUMBINGLY EXCELLENT. So i went in to this film with high expectations. Overall i was not dissapointed, but i disagree that this is the greatest film everm made and wonder why it gained such wide spread critical appeal. My best guess is that because so many movies have taken from the premise, it is considered genius. In other words it acts as the tempalte for so many other films. But in my opinion this film plants the seeds of an idea that was later refined in the magnificent Seven, and other remakes. And in all honesty I love the Magnificent 7 and like seven Samurai. However that is not to say that this film isn't very good. The acting is excellent for the most part, the story flows very well, and it has a very nice blend of comedy, action and drama...Overall it was a little slow moving, but it kinda needed to be to set up village/samurai relations. But this pace will bore many who are looking for action or 24/7 adventure. A good movie if you can't think of anything else to watch and you wanna see a cool foreign film, plus everyoen will think youre pro becasue you can refrence it and look like your a film buff.<br />The picture on the disc is far from excellent ,but is great considering how old this movie is. Actually it probobly looks jsut like it did when it was fist released. THe sound isnt overpowering and the music and the dialogue mix well together. As far as extras go, there is a commentary, tho i must confess that i didn't listen to it. watched the film once without it and that was enough for me. There is also a trailer on there which is kinda fun to watch, nohing stupendous. <br />I would definately say rent this one first. If you LOVE! old films or LOVE! Magnificent Seven, then buy this as it is an excellent older movie and the grandaddy of M7. In the end i enjoyed the film very much, and was glad i rented it. However doubt i'll ever have the urge to see it again.
B00005QIPH|1.0|OK, I am very open minded when it comes to new music, but it's been a while since I've been so repulsed by a new CD. The Strokes have the substance of wax paper. It is the most pretentious collection of lame retro-style crap I've heard in the last few years. They dress the part, and they look oh-so-cool, girls! This is a prime example of marketing and hype...enough with the retro thing, it's over. It's fine if you are genuine songwriters with something original to add to musical history, but this is totally irritating fluff. A perfect reflection of the current musical scene, for the most part. Bubbles, and no water. The production is trying so hard to sound \\"bad\\" when there is no need to...it just doesn't ring true, especially when you see their shtick live.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE A PARTICULAR PIECE OF MUSIC IN THIS MOVIE.<BR>ITS CALLED 'NUREGA' AND ITS AT THE PARTY IN DOMINICS HOUSE. IF ANYONE WANTS IT.. CHECK OUT AN ALBUM CALLED 'LAST ONE HOME' (ORGANIC AUDIO) YOU'LL LOVE IT!!
B000002MG1|5.0|I don't know how REM crafted this masterpiece, but they did. From beginning to end this album is well musically orchestrated masterpiece. First is the wonderful song &quot;Drive&quot; which is a very cool music number that just grabs you and doesn't let go. Then there's &quot;Try Not to Breathe&quot; which is a very wonderful and very musically oriented piece. Then comes &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight&quot; which is a a very good song. Then comes the overused but still well written masterpiece &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; a song about sucide. And has been used in many shows about depression or thoughts of sucide. Then comes a very well written instrumental song &quot;New Orleans Instrumental No. 1.&quot; It makes you wonder why they don't write more instrumentals. They do them so well. Remember &quot;Endgame&quot; from &quot;Out of Time&quot;. Then comes &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; a very good song. Then &quot;Monty gots a Raw Deal&quot; another good song. Then comes &quot;Ignoreland&quot; which is a good song, but the weakest track on this album. Then comes &quot;Star Me Kitten&quot; which is a very good song that has some great vocals by Michael Stipe. Then comes &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; the Andy Kaufman song that just is great. Then comes my favorite song on this album and probably my favorite REM song of all time &quot;Nightswimming&quot; a really beautiful wonderful song even though it is depressing. Then comes &quot;Find the River which is a good song.&quot; If you like REM or if you just like good music you got to get Automatic for the People. You just can't go wrong. O yeah it's best to listen to this album from start to finish without skipping around. It makes for a more enjoyable listening experience.

B00003CXXP|4.0|This collaboration between Stephen Spielberg and the late Stanley Kubrick must be one of the more eagerly anticipated movies of recent years. It brings together the vision of two cinematic geniuses; Kubrick, a Director intent on examining the human psyche and Speilberg, a master of modern American cinema, who instinctively seems to know what his audience wants. Apparently good friends until Kubrick's death a couple of years back, this was a project they had been discussing filming for the previous ten years but is it any good? And has Spielberg succeeded in blending the seemingly poles apart vision of Kubrick with his own cinematic style? The answer is mostly yes and partly no.<br />AI is a sentimental romantic sci-fi odyssey and it's also one of the saddest films in years. In an overpopulated world where the polar ice caps have melted, births are rationed to one per couple. When parents Monica and Henry Swinton's (Frances O'Connor & Sam Robards) son is apparently lost in an endless coma they are selected for the `adoption' of David (Hayley Joel Osment) an experimental `mecha' (robot) child. Initially David's prospective mother is freaked out by the idea but whilst still grieving for her apparently lost son, she soon becomes attached to David and takes the option of permanently encoding his circuits so that he will forever be tied to his mother. Everything seems to be going swimmingly only for the son Martin (Jake Thomas) to unexpectedly awake from his coma, which leads to David becoming a victim of his new brother's cruelty, his parents fears and now surplus to their requirements. Dumped into the wilderness with his super-toy Teddy, he goes on the run with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) a robo-rent-boy also on the lam after being framed for the hotel-room murder of one of his clients. David begins a Pinocchio type voyage of discovery in the hope of becoming a real boy and being reunited with his mother.<br />Personally, I thought this was an excellent film and I have been quite shocked and surprised at some of the very harshly critical reviews I've read in the UK's broadsheet newspapers. A.I. may not perfect by any means but I found it to be an extremely thought provoking, moving and in turns incredibly beautiful and incredibly sad film. Whilst visually very much a Spielberg movie both visually (comparisons can be drawn in style to both Close Encounters and ET) and narratively (he unusually takes a screenplay credit), the Kubrick influences are clearly in evidence in the somewhat cold and sterile beginning and the intellectualised Pinocchio themed (what is the essence of humanity) backdrop of the movie. It's a movie about love that is at times in a very Kubrickian manner, cold to the touch.<br />The CGI in this movie is nothing short of excellent and must have had ILM working overtime. Among the robots or `mechas' on show here are men and women with seamless half faces, eyeless sockets and heads that split open to show the androids inner workings. Also one of the most exciting and best things about the movie was Teddy, who was not just David's friend but also formed the true moral centre of the film. The effects were tremendous and if ever they can really invent such a toy, everybody will want one. Contrary to one review I read about the child acting being \\"some of the sickliest ever filmed\\" I think that Hayley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense) was once again superb and I do not believe I have ever seen a more talented child actor. I'm also a big fan of Jude Law but one of my few criticisms of the film would have to be aimed at his character Gigolo Joe. Whilst I don't feel that there was anything wrong with Jude's acting, I did find Gigolo Joe at times irritating, such as when he tweaks his head to create his own supposedly romantic (but in actuality mood killing) music soundtrack. It could also be argued that much of Spielberg's vision of the future was contradictory and dated with three wheeled cars, overpopulated cities, a drowned NewYork but leafy countrysides but to be honest that is probably nit-picking.<br /> It would also be fair to say that A.I. has an overlong ending, with a bit of a tagged on feel, which is a little too saccharine sweet (a Spielberg weakness). However, coming so soon after September 11th the final sequence set in a future New York city flooded by melted ice-caps, with the Manhattan skyline reduced to bungalows in the sea and the Statue of Liberty's hand poking up through the waves was incredibly pertinent, incredibly moving and incredibly surreal. It was almost as if Spielberg had somehow foreseen some incredible tragedy and this was his portrayal of Manhattan in a vale of tears.<br /><br />Whilst not Spielberg's best work, it's certainly not that far off and maybe if Kubrick had been around to oversee production we would have had a masterpiece. Although, what Spielberg has given us is a movie which is disturbing, perplexing and incredibly sad. If you're not moved then you haven't got a heart.w York but leafy countrysides but to be honest that is probably nit-picking. <br /> It would also be fair to say that A.I. has an overlong ending, with a bit of a tagged on feel, which is a little too saccharine sweet (a Spielberg weakness).

B00003CXI1|5.0|I loved the movie, but that was in part to the books.  If you haven't read the books, don't see the movie because you can't really get as in deapth with the characters in the movie like you can in the book.  I noticed that in the movie they NEVER said hedwig's name! It really got me going......(i'm a harry potter fanatic!!!) I can't wait for the fifth book to come out, but i can wait for the DVD cuz of all the extra stuff!!!...
B000002H72|5.0|Yaknow like when there is pretty cool cd there are just like a couple parts in certain songs that make them your favorite songs. Like just maybe the key the singer sings in, or the way an instrument cuts in our cuts out, or the emphasis a singer puts on a word, or i dont anything that just makes you really point out one certain part and makes you think oooh that parts really cool. Every song on this CD is nearly full of those parts. I have concluded that Frank Black is one of the most creative musicians. The only other artists that makes me think what i think when i listen to this would be Beck and &quot;Omar and Cedric&quot;... but that is a different story. I would recomend this cd to someone just who is into goofy catchy songs or someone who is way extreme into music that is extremely creative.<br />and also this cd has 15 tracks which is pretty long
B000023VR6|5.0|This is another great album by the master of the west coast beats. Dre does the usual masterful job on the production and is not bad on the mic on the songs that he does spit on. If there is a negative thing about this disc it is that there are too many skits and there are a lot of guests. Most of the guests fit the songs they are on. The highlight of the disc is the bangin track &quot;What's the difference&quot; where Dre, Xzibit and Eminem come with some great rhymes. Another highlight is the heartfelt &quot; The Message&quot; with Mary J. Blige Dre gets sensitive on this great track
B000059XYL|1.0|This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with &quot;The Whole Nine Yards&quot; and &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;).  The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn't any good), and there's really no good reason to watch it.  See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&amp;A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there'd be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it.  However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie.  What a waste of my time!
B000002TWN|5.0|This is a classic album in every sense of the word. D,Angelo is so talented that he makes all the new &quot;Neo-Soul&quot; artists look like imposters. The songs are so perfect it makes you think that this guy should have saved something for his next couple cd's. I challenge you to put on &quot;Lady&quot; At a party and not find one person singing the chorus along with the song. The influence of Prince is evident in the silky smooth falsetto voice that D'Angelo possesses. This album is a must have.
6300182770|5.0|This  is  a  chilling  tale  of  what  the  future  of  TV  could  do  and  one  man's  descent  into  fantasy  world  by  watching  a  50  second  clip  of  a  snuff  movie . It  is  a  complicated  enough  journey  into  seeing  where  reality  lies  and  where  fantasy  begins . As  always  with  most  Cronenberg  films  there  is  a  lot  of  gorey  parts  to  keep  you  satisfied . As  for  the  ending ( which  I  don't  want  to  give  away ), it  leaves  a  permanent  mark  in  your  mind  and  leaves  you  wanting  more
0451527712|4.0|I really enjoyed this reading although it was nothing like I had expected.  I was waiting for the bolt of lightning and then this horrible creature to appear just like in the movies.  I felt it was time consuming to read and at times hard to comprehend.  For example many people in my class did not understand how the &quot;monster&quot; could so easily learned to read and speak.  I felt at first the pace was rather slow but as the reader reached the climax of the story it became rather interesting.  I, myself, was very intrigued by this point in the book and found I could not put the reading down.  If I could have changed anything about this book I would have wanted Victor to tell others about his creation.  After reading this story I really questioned if the \\"monster\\" was really so horrible.  I feel the \\"monster\\" started off with good intentions but when he realized that his own creator wanted nothing to do with him he felt lost and alone.  Was the &quot;monster&quot; really asking Victor for too much?  All he wanted was a friend, someone to talk to and be with but no.  Its just like Shelley asked at the beginning who's fault is it the \\"monster\\" or his creator?  He, the \\"monster\\", was different and everyone fears different and has a hard time excepting different so he was perceived as an outcast.  This often happens in society.  Over all I feel this was a great book.  It kept my attention for the most part and kept me wanting more.

0385505833|4.0|I bought this book as a gift for my daughter, then decided to read it myself. I enjoyed it, and identified with the main characters.<br />However, I have a question for any of you out there who also read this book; what was the significance  of the character &quot;Marty&quot;?  Remember, Nora met him in the grocery store and could not remember his name.  He seemed to know her and also Blaire. He later came to their party and sang songs with the new son in law. He was described as having an &quot;orange and grey  beard&quot;.<br />His name was only mentioned as being overheard when he introduced himself to someone at the party.  HELP!  This is driving me nuts, is there a sub-plot here?<br />Thanks,<br />Margaret
B00004U8H4|3.0|i would have still given this a 3 if i hadnt read book 1st.the book of the same title is so much more superior that its depressing to watch.i know they cant do alot of the stuff the book does,but theres too much talking here.in the book,there are alot of chapters that are overlong,not interesting.they are vital though.the talky parts in the film version are not.the parts that are supposed to be comical are forced,and the way he flips out isnt set up properly.chloe really let me down here too,although there wasnt a juicy female role,she played it way too understated.if they(the producers/studio bigheads)wouldnt have minded an NC-17 rating,this could have been a better movie.i must give credit to miss harron.she did her best with some pretty disgusting material.i dont think it would have mattered if a man were to direct this,its just the ratings system and the harm it does to box office receipts.in the end,this is an enjoyable movie,the acting is good,(some lines are hurried and some scenes are forced),the plot is what it is.but i just cant help thinking that theres a better version waiting to be made!

B00005YTFG|5.0|A strangely unfamiliar approach to a musical is used in the making of Moulin Rouge.  At first the disarray presented makes no sense to the viewer but once you get yourself placed in the mind-frame required you are completely submerged into a new and exotic world.  A world of dancing and singing comes to life as you delve into a brothel where love blossoms.<BR>Obstacles are overcome and love prevails in this musical creation.  It is a performance that will not soon be surpassed by any other production and is by far one of the greatest films of its kind.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|Sade's Lover's Rock tour was nearly a religious experience. Never before at a concert had I felt such comraderie between concert-goers. We laughed and joked with our neighbors, were tolerant of exhuberent fans, and sang along with every nuance and subtle melody that Sade gave us. Her rendition of 'Is It a Crime' was indescribable, except that at its end my girlfriend was nearly in tears (as was I). I said at that moment that if someone had offered me a CD of her live version of that song alone, I would have bought for everything in my checking account at the time. Who knew that Sade was listening? This CD is excellent, it helps me recreate the moment, and it reaffirms my belief that Sade is one of the greatest vocalists of our time. I appreciate her giving us (those who attended and those who did not) a front-row seat on this tour. If ten stars were available, I would give it eleven.
0553579908|5.0|Vastly entertaining and engrossing. The multifaceted characters stay with you long after you finish the book. They have depth and complexity that makes them come alive. I couldn't put the book down; amazing considering the length of the story. This is a series you'd actually call in sick to stay home and read all day.
B000005EJL|2.0|This is nothing more than a glorified Rick Davies solo album.  With the exception of You Win, I Lose, there is no \\"Supertramp\\" content on this album.   Mark Hart is definitely no Roger Hodgson and the fact that Rick Davies tries to pass this album off as a Supertramp album is nothing more than an insult to the intelligence of classic \\"Supertramp\\" fans.<br />If you are looking for some classic \\"Supertramp\\" material, you're better off obtaining Roger Hodgson's solo albums, because you're not getting any from this album.
B00005Q45W|5.0|After a rather too lenghty haitus from recording, Leonard Cohen came down from the mountain (literally) and comes back with another gem.  It's everything you would expect from a Leonard Cohen album: poetic lyrics, spare instrumentation, and That Voice.  The longer I live, the more I realize that Leonard Cohen is pretty much the only artist whose music I can't live without.  I've never written a review before, and I probably never will again, because almost anything after Leonard Cohen is just so much filler.

078324228X|1.0|If you are a fan of movies of substance, then pass on this one because &quot;The Hurricane&quot; is likely not for you. It's a sappy, cheesy, artificially sentimental movie that opts for a couple of preposterous turns in the story line in order to squeeze a sniffle or even a tear or two.<br />If, however, you are the type who like a good cry or you want a grossly out-of-proportion rendition of the truth, then this movie may do the trick - just so long as you really don't pay much attention to the story line and how ludicrous and absurdly bad Denzel Washington's (over)acting is. It was no surprise to me that the director of the 1975 original version of &quot;Rollerball&quot; patched this thing together.
0887307280|4.0|This is an excellent book if you are a person looking to know more about owning a business and turning it into a franchise.  However, some of the things that the book discusses about owning a business i do not believe are neccessarily valid.  The book makes it sound like the only way that you can be successful is if you build a business merely to sell it and franchise it out.  I am pretty sure that some of the most successful businesses are not franchises in the way that they are explained in this book.  Probably the number one example that I can think of is Microsoft.  There are others also.

It has been nearly 2 months now and THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED.
0446677450|5.0|Go to any bookstore and you will find tons of books on how to make money, how to manage it, and how to &quot;get rich quick&quot;. What makes this book stand out is that it explains how to develop a philosophical approach to looking at money and how you use it. The author's outlook was shaped, as explained in the first chapter, by his two \\"Dads&quot;, one his real father, a well-educated bureaucrat who, despite earning a decent salary, never seemed to stay more than a few steps ahead of the bill collector. His other &quot;Dad&quot; was in fact the father of his best friend, a high school dropout who nonetheless went on to become one of the richest men in Hawaii. Naturally, it was this second Dad who passed on vital lessons of financial savvy, which allowed him to retire at 47.<br />His central premise is this - his \\"Poor Dad\\" (who he usually refers to as his \\"Educated Dad\\") followed the conventional road to success, namely, get good grades, go to college, then get a job with a large organization that provides good job security and benefits, yet in the end his Dad never broke out of what he calls the \\"Rat Race\\", the never ending cycle of paychecks, bills and debts in which he believes far too many Americans are stuck. In contrast, his \\"Rich Dad\\" focused on learning how to make money, and ended up handing his son a financial empire. From these dual role models he derived his own approach to becoming rich, which of course he lays out in his book. <br />At the core of his approach is the belief that, to become truly successful, one needs to become financially literate, to understand how to build assets and to structure your life so these assets (defined as anything which produces income) exceed one's liabilities (that which takes money out of your pocket) Unlike most money management gurus and authors, he doesn't delve into details and specific strategies (aside from recounting some of his own successes) but instead spends most of his time laying out a philosophic viewon the process of becoming wealthy. Because his central premise is simply this: The reason the rich are rich is because they view money differently than the rest of us. For example, his educated Dad advised him to climb the corporate ladder whereas his rich Dad asked simply \\"Why not OWN the ladder?\\" And make no mistake, he is writing to people who want to become RICH, not to folks who simply want to know how to buy mutual funds or set up a portfolio. And implicit in this is the desire to take risks, and follow the less traveled path. As a result, people who prefer safety and security will probably not like this book much.<br />Another group who won't like it are those on the political left. He makes clear he dislikes high taxes (or \\"working for the government\\" as he puts it) and finds them unproductive, since the truly rich can afford to hire top accountants and lawyers to shelter their cash thus leaving the educated upper-middle class to take the brunt of the tax burden. He clearly thinks being rich is a GOOD thing and that he doesn't like the government acting as if people like him are villains to be punished via the tax code. He also takes shots at the education establishment, which he charges as being archaic and designed mainly to produce good employees as opposed to teaching people to be financially literate. And, since he has a passion for dealing in real estate and uses examples of this to explain how he made money, some people may find this off-putting, thinking to themselves \\"I don't want to read a book about how to get rich in real estate!\\" while missing his larger points. Also, some people might take offense by reading into his book that he thinks most working and middle class people who work an honest job are chumps, but that also misses the point. I believe he is instead trying to say that most people, due to a lack of financial literacy, fail to seize opportunities and that what he really wants is to see more people living happier lives because they are controlling their money as opposed to being controlled by it.
B00004X01U|4.0|...Maybe you've heard of her?  Yes, Madonna!  Lets see...Last time we heard from her she was giving us a Gwen Stefani-ish image and was into the whole Spirituality theme.  Now what does she give us? Well, she wears Cowboy hats of course!  With a great mix of Techno, Trance, Pop, Dance and Country \\"Music\\" keeps us up and never fall asleep when listening to the album.  Standout tracks include: \\"Music\\" which was her first single (And you can DEFINATLY tell she is working with French DJ's...I get \\"Music makes the people come together\\" but \\"Music makes the bougoise and the rebel\\"?!), \\"I Deserve It\\" which has a country/techno-ish feel, \\"Amazing\\" which has a Rock-type feel, \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" which has a Trance/Techno type feel and is also very relaxing, \\"Don't Tell Me\\" which was her second single taking Country-like roots, \\"What it Feels Like For A Girl\\" combining Pop, Trance and Techno and the concluding Madonna-written \\"Gone\\" which has a Rock/Folk type vibe.  That covers well...most of the CD, right?  The others are kinda forgettable and are better as background music for a party or get to gether with friends...as there is not much substance lyric-wise to them.  After all it's more of a Techno-ish album which is so cool! We as the public can always cound on the Goddess of Music, Madonna to change every once and a while and this time she's Done it again! And for the better! \\"Music\\" is overall reccomended to any Die-Hard Madonna fan and Techno/Trance lovers. I give \\"Music\\" a B+!!

Since I was sitting close to the stage I was able to see that Britney was infact singing.  People who say that she lip syncs her songs at concerts are as someone else put it jealous of the fact that she can sing and they can't.  If you love Britney you should get this DVD.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The movie Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone was a wonderful movie for all ages. The director was able to make this movie a big hit while still remaining faithful to the author's vision.The cast in the movie did a very good jog of acting. This movie is definatly a movie for all ages! Honestly, at first when I heard about the Harry Potter book, I wasn't really interested in reading, thinking it was a book for kids. Once I saw the trailer for the movie, I knew it was a movie I had to see! After seeing the movie I got hooked on the books, and now it is up on my shelf of favorite books! This movie is not one that you will be bored of easily, it has it's shares of surprising turns. So if you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend you to buy the DVD,one that will become many people's favorite movie's of all time.
B000002UB6|2.0|To be fair, The Beatles never really had their hearts into the making of this album. Recorded mostly under the harsh glare of studio lighting in the cold confines of Twickenham studio, this 'live performance' project was eventually shelved in favour of a return to the multitrack comfort of a proper recording studio. From there, work commenced on the band's true swan-song, Abbey Road. As the band disintegrated, Let it Be gathered dust and seemed destined to bootleg obscurity. That is until John Lennon saw fit to hire Phil Spector to tidy up the production and release it as a final Beatles album. In effect, it is little more than an odds & sods collection whose release was hardly endorsed by the group as a whole (McCartney had serious reservations.) Nevertheless, it occupies a space among the band's other albums on the record store shelves, and therefore deserves to be held up to critical scrutiny. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up very well. Apart from Spector's production which is an unmitigated disaster, Let it Be suffers from a serious lack of first rate material. Two of the songs are credited to all four members (Dig It, Maggie Mae) and are little more than free-form jam sessions; Lennon contributes the weary-sounding Across The Universe; Harrison sounds completely uninspired on his numbers (I Me Mine, For You Blue); and McCartney provides a disturbing glimpe into the future of his solo career, with the syrupy title-track (replete with a Leslie-tinged by-the-numbers guitar break and female choir backing.) The album's one true moment of musical inspiration, The Long and Winding Road, is nearly destroyed by a ghastly symphonic accompaniment, courtesy of Spector. Gone are the tight, angular orchestal arrangements of George Martin, replaced by synthetic string-sections that practically drip out of the speakers. Abbey Road provided such a perfect, harmonious ending to The Beatles' great career. It's a shame that Lennon and company saw fit to undermine that with a half-baked souvenir album that can only be seen as a final cash-in on the band's name.
B000000W5L|4.0|The high points on this album are absolutely amazing, but I have two complaints. First of all, this album should have been a single album. As double albums go, it's a short one, clocking it at under 70 minutes--a possible indication that the Stones didn't have quite enough material to make an epic album as uniformly excellent as, say, Quadrophenia or Physical Graffiti. My second issue is the production. True, it gives the album and appropriate mood, but sometimes it's just plain annoying, detracting from some otherwise terrific songs like Tumbling Dice.
630451087X|4.0|If a painter scrawls other words besides his name on his decorated canvas he scatters his emphasis. Lost Highway needles you to listen here when you should be watching over there and unfolds in tragic reverse/forward/and at the most circuitous.<br />It is frustrating and it is uncomfortable and it is boring but when the image reigns free with music acting as the model startling renderings occur. The movie is a siamese twin, the first half a pensive atmosphere, a suspense spiked with coherence, the second half a drowsy, insidious wonder of mixtures. Unfortunately there is also that unnaturally deformed link of a middle. <br />It is, after all, Fred Madison's (lead character) world so it can be what it wants. Though he is as anthropomorphic as his wife, she distracts as the attraction so it may seem to the viewer it is not really Fred's world at all.<br />It may be best to drink up this movie with the eyes and try not to delineate as much as those ears can. By this method the experienced sights and sounds could weld their bliss or cancer to your reveries.
B00005OM4K|4.0|CCR started out as the Rodney Dangerfield of rock music; they got no respect because of their hit singles and popularity. It took some time before national critics caught on to the importance of this quitessential band.

The sound quality is a huge step in the right direction--the K2 20bit mastering system does justice to these great albums.CCR has been repackaged almost as many times as Elvis (and more than The Beatles or The Stones). There's some complaints about the \\"whoosing\\" sound of the symbols due to misalignment that occurs during the mastering. Actually that \\"whoosing\\" is also heard on the meticulously (and better I might add) remasters done by Steve Hoffman for DCC released some time back so unless I'm missing something the person who wrote that review is imagining a problem that isn't there.<br /><br />You could go for the newly remastered hybrid SACDs released by Fantasy but the CD layer is drawn from the same masters and they haven't been remixed for 5.1 on the secondary layer. The music deserves 5 stars (except for \\"Madri Gras\\" a clear 3 star album and \\"Pendulum\\" a 4 star album with a bit of filler. Also, the \\"Live in Europe\\" album sounds music better here but it, too, is not a 5 star performance. It is quite good however hence the 4 stars for the entire set).<br /><br />This isn't the perfect box set but it's pretty darn close. There are some sound quality flaws (primarily on the pre-CCR recordings) but this is a huge improvement over previous versions.The sound quality blows away the inferior sounding reissues of the late 80's.
B000002BYD|4.0|Gathering all resources, Pearl Jam have shaped anew some of the mystical waywardness which traversed so fleet-footed through Ten. Brain of J slides, scraps and sorts itself out over a plundering rhythm. Faithful follows, shifting richly around its guiding call. On No Way fortune is always out of grasp where Given To Fly gives it a chance to glitter on. Vedder's voice reclaims the inimitable scope it had forged when Pearl Jam first arrived, a voice that in its grandest sweeps floods their songs with a boundless sky view. Wishlist is a vulnerable song, softly whittling guitars which reach out midway before retreating again, the lyrical touches fragile and careless.<BR>&quot;Stunned by own reflection...&quot;, Vedder muses on Pilate, regarding the varying shades of reflecting upon experience, the song barely holds. Do The Evolution has a submerged excitement to it, its commanding guitar licking at the bleak observation of humans' greed for survival, Vedder's voice croaking in disgust while caterwauling with it. After a brief discombobulation, the next song MFC comes in a rush of striding guitar with an equally paced vocal, the next, Low Light, has that respite to it which Pearl Jam can hone exquisitely, a pillowy rumination which glows like a familiar place you're reminded of and yearn to visit again. In Hiding is a triumph, a gently unravelling recall which bursts into a virtuosity, a paean to lying low in sullen expectation. <BR>The next song, Push Me, Pull Me is a churning mix, flushed out by the wry confessions of Vedder. All Those Yesterdays stirs up an irresistible affirming energy. This album does not zoom one's thoughts off to a wondrous place like &quot;Ten&quot; or smother itself in lashing out while mining some encouraging jewels like &quot;Vitalogy&quot; and &quot;No Code&quot;; it is similar to Vs. in its potency, but unlike Vs. its heartbeat is steady and staid, and then leaping at what is terrifically in sight and needing a messenger.
B000002UB3|5.0|REMASTER UPDATE:<br /><br />The 2009 remaster for \\"Abbey Road\\" sounds to my ears better than the previous version. The bass is finally captured in all of its glory and some small mistakes have been corrected (edits, etc.) that were more readily evident on the previous editions.<br /><br />For the overall sound I still prefer the Black Triangle edition on CD (which is the only grail for many Beatles fans) as it has a warm analog sound missing here BUT for overall detail the remaster wins hands down.<br /><br />They never discussed amongst themselves that this would be the last Beatles album recorded. Given that John, George and Ringo had all quit at some point between 1968 and the recording of Abbey Road, it was pretty clear that this was truly The End. At 12 million copies sold Abbey Road stands as the most popular Beatles album. It's also probably their slickest next to Pepper. What make Abbey Road one of the best Beatles albums is the sheer quality of the songwriting and performances. George finally stepped out of the shadow of John and Paul and contributed two of his finest songs. Ringo's Octopus' Garden might have been less inspired than the rest of the album (except for the one clunker Maxwell's Silver Hammer), but the band's playing, harmonies and the sheer fun that went into making it is evident in every second of the song.<br /><br />The cover stands in sharp contrast to Pepper; it's just the four band members crossing the street. Visually it's also a great metaphor for the band's career; they had managed to cross from obscurity to superstardom and helped change the face of music. They were also leaving \\"The Beatles\\" behind and traveling a road they had never been down before--solo careers and a musical \\"divorce\\" awaited them on the other side of the street.<br /><br />Abbey Road is probably one of the best places to start listening to The Beatles. Along with Revolver, Rubber Soul, A Hard Day's Night and Pepper it's also one of their finest works from McCartney's swampy bass line in Come Together to the final secret (although it's listed on the CD packaging the first run of LPs didn't have the last track listed )acoustic notes of Her Majesty.to the final secret (although it's listed on the CD packaging the first run of LPs didn't have the last track listed )acoustic notes of Her Majesty.

B00005LK1Q|5.0|For those who love this album, the recent Japanese issued HDCD version is just what the doctor ordered. Finally, the veil of muddiness (especially in the drum/percussion department) is lifted to a large degree. While not &quot;crystalline&quot;, the production/sound is as good as it has ever been offered to the buyer of this album. It easily surpasses the sound quality of the 1994 remaster.  A bit pricey ... but if you _love_ this album, like I do, consider buying this Japanese HDCD version. It's the best quality (presently) version of this much maligned album. Long Live TFTO!I LOVE IT!
B0021L9MJG|5.0|One night, an angry father (Tom Atkins) notices his son (Joe King) has been reading a violent horror comic called \\"Creepshow\\" and throws away in the trash. It all leads up to five scary stories such as \\"Father's Day\\" which tells of a former rich old man back from the grave to get his Father's Day cake that he wanted, next is \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrell\\" deals with a goofy farmer (Stephen King) who discovers a meteroite that oozes a substance all over him and his farm to grow grass everywhere even on himself. Followed by \\"Something to Tide You Over\\" has a crazy rich man named Richard (Leslie Nielsen) who buries a man (Ted Danson) and his lover (Gaylen Ross) up to their necks in sand at the beach to torture them until they come back for vengence. A nagged Professor (Hal Halbrook) who has an annoying wife (Andrienne Barbeau) finds an old crate in the local college containing an old yet still living snow monster and finally a millionair (EG Marshall) is under attack in his apartment by vicious cockroaches.<br /><br />Excellent horror comedy anthology of horror stories inspired by those classic EC horror comics of the 50's, director George A. Romero and writer Stephen King have crafted a very original anthology of horror stories that have a dark sense of humor and excellent make-up effects by Tom Savini. It became a cult favorite over the years and even has an animated comic book feel with animated in-between frames and segments before the stories start and an all-star cast makes this a pure winner.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is average with picture and sound with only one extra which is the trailer, i wish that they would release a R1 special edition.

B00005O5CM|3.0|I'll admit that I went into this expecting fluff, and that's exactly what I got.  But at the same time there WAS a decent story (better than I can say about most frilly films nowadays) and there is something very empowering about the ending, sort of a reverse Grease effect, that had me grinning.

B0000024R8|5.0|It seems to be a popular sport to make fun of Bob Dylan's musical abilities. His guitar playing, harmonica and especially his singing have all been subject to ridicule by his peers. While very few will risk running down his talents as a songwriter, musicians gleefully rip into Dylan's musical talents.<br />I urge any musician who thinks they have the right to take such a stance to give his first album a listen. Basically recorded in one session with no overdubs, it shows Bob Dylan as a hungry young Folksinger. The guitar playing is quite admirable, finger-picked and clean. Dylan's voice is clear, without a hint of the slurry nasal tones that would later become his trademark. The harmonica playing is outstanding. Most harmonica players who ridicule Dylan's playing don't realize that Dylan had been working as a studio harmonica player before he embarked on a solo career and had appeared on albums by Carolyn Hester, Harry Belafonte and Big Joe Williams. The harmonica playing on this album is quite enviable.<br />For those who don't like Bob Dylan's playing, please give this album a chance. I think you'll like it.

B000007SIJ|4.0|This is one of the better DTS titles. I much prefer DVD-Audio, but the sound is fine on this cd. The only problem I have with it is that &quot;Space Intro&quot;, which leads off the original disc and is the intro to &quot;Fly Like An Eagle&quot;, is totally omitted from this disc, and there is no excuse for that.
B00005N53P|5.0|Picked this up via amazon.co.uk and wasn't thrilled upon first listen, but since I've been walking around with it on my MP3 player for the last couple of days it's grown on me -- it's truly infectious after a little while. It does evoke the Velvet Underground and generally has a punk-ish feel, but it's also thoroughly modern. I don't have the musical vocabulary to get more into detail, but I'll say that most of the other reviewers here have got it right. This album rocks.
B00003CXI1|2.0|This is supposed to be a review of Harry Potter, but I feel like talking about two previews I saw before Harry Potter more than Harry Potter itself: the newest Lord of the Rings and Star Wars: Episode II trailers, which were amazing and contained more originality, imagination, and pure excitement in them than HP did in its entire 2 hour-30 minute running time. HP proves that popularity (2nd or 3rd highest international gross so far) does not always equal quality. <br />The film is about a boy, Harry Potter, who is raised by brutal and uncaring foster parents in a cupboard storage area under the stairs of their house (no, I'm being serious). One day he receives an invitation to Hogwarts, a school for training wizards, and Harry sets off to begin his career as a wizard in training. On the way, he discovers information about the death of his natural parents and is caught up in a plot to get the eponymous sorceror's stone.<br />I appreciate how HP tries to contain a somewhat complex plot, complete with a mystery and history. It's very ambitious for a kid's film, but it still fails to succeed in this area. The first 15 minutes - showing Harry in his life with his foster parents - are nothing short of unbearable; Harry's situation and his mean parents are meant to evoke sympathy for his character and provide pathos, but it all ends up playing out as a comedy with the parents not being threatening at all but just bumbling fools. His treatment does not end up accomplishing what it should - making us genuinely desire that Harry go to Hogwarts and escape this undeserved life - but rather only serves as a kind of weird, humorous mess, and the only reason we are happy Harry has gotten into Hogwarts is because it means this segment of the film is finally over.<br />On the journey through the film we do encounter some nice visuals, the direction here being at its strongest: the Dickensian detail of Diagon Alley, the interior of Hogwarts with its morphing paintings, shifting stairs, transparent ceiling, and so on. However, Chris Colombus is not an Oscar tier director, to put it lightly, and one can only sigh to imagine how someone capable like Spielberg or even Tim Burton would have brought the film to more life. The effects also hamper the film a lot (except the invisibility cloak, which is quite impressive in a simple way) - the troll and three-headed dog look awful, as does a lot of the Quidditch match, and the centaur looks like a videogame character on par with the awful job they did with the Scorpion King at the end of Mummy Returns. <br />The acting is fine. Radcliffe is good because he's good at being shy and understated, which is what his character is like. Alan Rickman is devilishly entertaining and drips his lines with venom. The other kids are okay, sometimes bordering on annoying. <br />The Quidditch match is a much ballyhooed action piece in the film, and it turns out to be pretty mediocre. There is great speed and velocity in it, to be sure; but the CG people on broomsticks turn out to be quite fake looking when the film decides to speed their frame rate up to 10 times their previous speed in the blink of a second, in the hopes that we won't notice and will just think it's their lightning reflexes. The game itself never gets very interesting because the rules are various and confusing, and are only explained in a brief two minute segment beforehand. I find myself asking more questions about how the game is supposed to be played and why people aren't just chasing after that damn golden ball thing instead of being able to \\"enjoy\\" the match.<br />I mentioned the LOTR and SW trailers that played before this, and I must say I am glad these other fantasy/sci-fi films are coming/have come out relatively soon after HP, because hopefully people will realize just how much HP \\"borrows\\" ideas and elements from them, especially LOTR. Potter, to be completely honest, just isn't a very imaginative or creative film: the wizards are the typical long-bearded type (Richard Harris' Dumbledor looks like a carbon copy of Gandalf from LOTR), the witches are the typical broomstick-wielding, black pointy hat-wearing type, the goblins look like a cross between Yoda and (again) the goblins we will see in LOTR, the spells and magic we see in the film aren't anything new or interesting, there aren't any truly exciting action sequences, and there are plot holes galore: Why does Snape hate Harry? Can't Dumbledor come up with a better spell to protect the sorceror's stone? What did Voldemort have against Harry's parents in the first place? <br />I don't want to waste much more time talking about this film. Honestly, why has this film been so popular? Even if we ignore the obvious \\"inspirations\\" it has taken from other sources and look at it for its \\"own merits,\\" we still end up with a cheesy, kiddie fantasy flick with clichéd and typical fantasy wizard/witch figures, cutesy kid characters that spout cheesy comic relief one-liners like \\"wicked!\\" or \\"she really needs to straighten out her priorities,\\" fake special effects, an action sequence played up to be the central event in the film that is bogged down by poor CG and confusing rules, a running time that is too long, subplots that take the film off on a tangent but end up contributing nothing to the central \\"story\\" , a very silly ending, and the fact that we still come away from the film knowing almost nothing about wizardry. <br />But what do I know? 600 million dollars can't be wrong. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to finish watching the special features for Phantom Menace and begin getting hyped up for Episode II, because unlike Harry Potter, Star Wars deserves its popularity.
0789723107|5.0|If there is only one book that you ever read on Web site design, this should be it. This book completely changed the way I think about web site usage. Previously I made the assumption that people might actually read something in print on a web site. But the authors gave me the insight into how it really is. Web pages have to be visually obvious.<br />The guidelines that the book gave me inspired me to do a compete redesign around the principles in the book. I have read about 4 website design books but this was the only book that gave the overall feel about how people use websites and how to design them so that user can be productive without having to think, read or figure things out, because they won't.
B000059HAI|5.0|I have recently purchased a DVD player and although I have had the VHS version of \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" since it was released I now own the DVD. I also own the DVD of \\"Pearl Harbor\\" I feel that the computer graphics used to generate the attack scenes in \\"Pearl\\" are something that can't be equaled and must be seen to be believed, \\"Tora\\" give a much more detailed and accurate account of the events surrounding December 7, 1941. Since the first time that I saw Tora Tora Tora, I have always been fascinated by the degree of knowledge that the members of the military community in Washington D.C. had of the \\"Surprise\\" attack by The Japanese Empire. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in the events of World War II.
B00004U3UG|2.0|I bought this version hoping that it would incorporate the scenes I had seen on tv that I hadn't seen in the original theatrical version.  It delivered on that point, but the quality of these deleted scenes and extended footage was about as good as a tape you had played a hundred times.  It was fuzzy as hell.  The view goes from clean to poor too often to ignore.  I was told this was because this version was taken off of a foreign laserdisk.  I would recommend getting the new bootleg version.  It's the dvd with the paper cover.  In this version the poor image quality problem has been fixed.  So in my opinion, steer clear of this dvd and get the bootleg version.
B00003CXRP|5.0|This movie reminds me of \\"Forrest Gump\\" because of the sentimental themes, the subtle, creative symbols, and the proactive, determined struggle of the main character, which happens to be played by Tom Hanks in both movies.<br />The theme of this movie is about what is really important.  Chuck Noland (pun for \\"no land\\") works for Federal Express and oversees time management.  He thinks time is wasting and he doesn't know how right he is.  He's constantly working and flying all over the world.  He exchanges Christmas gifts with his girlfriend at the airport in the car then hands her a wrapped gift which is obviously an engagement ring.  He tells her to hold on to it until New Years Eve, and promises he'll be with her then.  She gave him a family heirloom pocket watch with her picture in it.  He says he'll always keep it set to Dallas time and then rushes to his plane, which tragically crashes into the ocean.<br />He is the sole survivor but luckily he managed to float on a liferaft overnight and by morning stumbled upon a small uninhabited island.  This is where he begins being what is called proactive-- he deals best he can with what life dealt him.  He is resourceful and exercises initiative.  The bulk of the movie, his stay on the island, is very unique because he is the only human being shown, there is no music, yet it never ceases to be fascinating.  He could just wither away and die or even commit suicide, which he almost does, but he decides to live.  But for what?  Namely for his girlfriend, whom he thinks about constantly and keeps the pocketwatch open to her picture.  Symbolically, while the plane was losing control, he dropped the watch and risked his life to get it before it fell out of the broken plane.    The plane crash symbolizes the harm of overcommitment to work and being too busy and focused on schedules and time.   The watch symbolizes his life back at civilization.  The plane crash made the watch stop ticking.  I also think he decides to live justfor the sake of life itself even with all its discomforts.  A great turning point and memorable scene of the movie is when he bravely decides to voyage off the island on a raft he constructed.  He could easily die in the middle of the ocean but the reward is to possibly get back to civilization.  <br />The reason it is a turning point in the movie is because when he gets back, it actually seems as if he were better off on the island.  As he's floating away from the island, he looks back at it and you can feel that he will miss it because of all his hard work, all he went through, and all he achieved.  Notice the title of the movie is \\"Cast Away\\" not \\"Castaway\\".  This is because the real point is that being cast away by his lover was worse than being a castaway for four years.  On the island, he yearned for companionship so bad he actually developed a relationship with a volleyball.  Of course everyone thought he was long dead, including his girlfriend.  So she married someone else and had kids.  His friends throw a party for him, but he seems the least happy one there, thinking of whether or not he'll get his girlfriend back.  Her husband greets him awkwardly as we would expect him to and explains that his wife is confused and doesn't want to see him right away.  However, he should have at least prepared a little better as to what to say to him and been friendlier.  Symbolically, he is a dentist and once performed a root canal on Chuck.  At this point, I really felt contempt for her new husband and I was rooting for Chuck.  I felt he deserved her after all he went through and how he never stopped loving her even after being away for four years.  <br />She seems ambivalent and confused at first, having meetings with Chuck and showing him the news articles and scrapbook she has of him and how she kept the Jeep that they were in together last at the airport.  As he drives away in it, she chases him and kisses him and tells him he's the love of her life.  Yet, her decision soon becomes clear as she goes back to her new husband, expensive house, and children.  I felt so sad for Chuck.<br />Of all the packages that washed ashore, he kept the last one unopened.  He finally delivered it in person when he got back.  Saving this package for that purpose shows his determination and hope for the future.  Why else would he have saved it?  Just like in Forrest Gump, this is a subtle, curious action.  He leaves a note saying the package saved his life.  No one is home and we never learn what was in the package or their response.  The package was of no tangible use to him like the contents of the other packages but it was the hope that he would be able to deliver it that saved his life.  As he's leaving, he stands at a crossroads.  He's out west where miles of flat ground stretch all around him.  A pretty, vivacious woman drives up and tells him the names of each of the roads and where they lead.  I wondered why he just let her drive away when she seems interested in him and he's single trying to get over a lost love.  The movie ends there, with Chuck standing at the crossroads not knowing where to go next, symbolizing how his life has been turned upside down twice and the big question on his mind is, \\"Now what?\\"  The messages of the movie are that close relationships are more important than working and that we've got to do the best we can with the cards life deals us.
0767821629|4.0|By the time I had seen this film on video, I had already seen the two films it is often compared to, THE MATRIX and DARK CITY, and although I have enjoyed both of these motion pictures on numerous occasions, I still find that I can always watch THE THIRTEEN FLOOR and get drawn back in.<br /><br />It could very well be that what other reviewers are critical of about this movie is what actually makes me like it all the more; namely that science fiction that makes up a large part of the story line is not so complicated as to overpower the film noir-like quality this movie also possesses.  The plot remains simple yet provocative, particularly after one encounters the plot twist near the end of the movie.<br />And it is that plot twist that provides one of the reasons why I slip this DVD of this movie into my player twice as often as I do those other two films.....  With The Matrix and with Dark City, I am made to question the reality of the environment I live in; with The Thirteenth Floor, I am forced to examine the very foundation of my own existance. Deep concepts indeed...and from such a simple movie too!<br />Besides that, I loved Fuller's 1937 simulation world, from the slightly sepia cast that colored everything, to the slightly edgy quality of the music in the cabaret (The program, like all computer programs, still had a few bugs in it....).<br /><br />OK...I will agree that the plot, though simple, still managed to show more depth than any of the characters within it ....and the scene at the very end of the film could have been fleshed out more.  BUT with that one star taken away, I still would recommend this movie....<br />Rent it and see it and find out I mean. Get a copy for your collection when you want to see it again.....I did.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|As of this writing, the subject of this review, Memento, is probably the best film of 2001.<br />Leonard Shelby has a rare form of short-term amnesia; he can't form new memories. The only thing he does remember is everything in his life up to the night his wife was raped and killed by an anonymous assailant who gave Leonard the head injury that caused his condition. Now Leonard is obsessed with finding him, despite his handicap. He writes notes to himself, takes pictures of important people and places, and even tattoos important facts on his body. He will not give up, even as he wakes up every day not knowing what happened the day before.<br />With a premise like the one written above, do you really need to read the rest of this review to convince yourself that you simply must go see this movie? The possibilities for great suspense and mystery should be obvious from the premise just given. Memento has the perfect concept for a wonderful mystery, and takes advantage of it through the structure, which is unique, engaging, and central to the film's method of bringing the viewer in. One of the important questions for the film would be, How can it tell the story in an interesting way, and at the same time let us in on Leonard Shelby's world? How can it give us an idea of what it's like to be him? All these questions are solved in one fell swoop with the help of a great, non-linear plot structure.<br />The film starts with a memorable image: a Polaroid being developed backwards, eventually being put back into the camera by our protagonist, Leonard Shelby, after he has shot someone. This first image sets up the style of the rest of the film: nonlinear and looping back onto itself, the film is split up into subsections of plot that take place after the one following it. So, in essence, we are being told the story backwards, with each subsequent section ending where the previous one began. It's a unique, engaging, and important method of storytelling this film employs, and it never gets confusing or unclear for the audience. Of course, Shelby lives in real time, in constant forward motion, not traveling further and further back in time like we are while watching the film. But in order to capture the essence of Shelby's existence, we have to be given the sensation of suddenly being thrust into a situation without knowing (or in Shelby's case, remembering) what has happened before. We have to be as clueless as he is. That is accomplished through Memento's structure. It's much more than a gimmick; it's a gateway into the protagonist's mind. <br />From there, the film simply takes off, and never slows down. We are constantly kept alert and engaged in what's happening because we are as clueless as Leonard, and simply because the mystery is so great. His investigation for \\"John G,\\" the killer, is fascinating and leads to many twists, turns, new alliances, and back-stabbings. Just when you think you have it \\"figured out\\" (if you're foolish enough to really think so) the film takes a turn and opens up whole new possibilities. <br />With the smoothness and grace of a film that knows it has a spectacular script, Memento introduces its various themes seamlessly into the main detective-story narrative. What is so immensely enjoyable about watching Memento is that it has so much thematic depth to it; all of the plot's twists and turns only serve to emphasize one of its many motifs. How far can someone rely on his or her memory of something until it starts to become distorted? Shelby's situation is so precarious because he is the most unreliable of narrators; the audience, following the story, is dependant on him for telling the story. Like a cancer, this realization is introduced in the viewer and grows as the film progresses. Shelby is a living, breathing personification of an intriguing philosophical question: can someone live without memory, by just knowing the facts about a situation and going on them? \\"Memory is unreliable. Facts are the onlything you can count on,\\" Shelby says. He lives that quote, for time doesn't exist for someone like Shelby. Since he can't be aware of the passage of time, not knowing where he has been or how long it's been since his wife died, time really has no meaning for him. His \\"time\\" is merely the short bursts of consciousness that flare up and die every day. Shelby's condition is one of the most tragic situations any protagonists in film have been in. <br />The acting is, in a word, excellent, with Guy Pearce wrenchingly inhabiting this character. He's able to be charming, clueless, determined, and gruff all simultaneously. He is a detective trying to figure out the mystery but raging against the confines of his own mind, which prevent him from doing so. He talks to other characters in a polite and nice, but neutral manner, as if unsure whether or not he has actually talked to this person before but just doesn't remember it. It's a quietly intense performance, and the audience feels his pain through it.<br />I end this review with a mention of the ending of the film. No spoilers here, but not only does it manage to surprise us, shock us, and put the entire story in a new perspective, but it also wrenches the sympathy out of us so naturally because of what it does to Leonard Shelby in terms of his development as a character. To say that we discover a new side of him is to put it lightly; we simultaneously cry out in horror and sympathy at the final, brutal revelation. To say anything more would be wrong. It is the perfect ending to a perfect movie.
B00005Q45W|5.0|&quot;Ten New Songs&quot; seems to me to be the album LC has been put on earth to give us. I know that might sound pretentious, but how else to convey my experience of listening to songs like <BR>&quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; (so deeply noble and heart-rending)and <BR>&quot;Love Itself&quot; (surely recounting an actual episode of transcendence, the language has the directness and mystery demanded by the ineffable). <br />No other album has so caused me to hold my breath, figuratively and almost literally, as I quiet myself to allow the power of these whispered-sung intimacies to saturate my heart.<br />Well, I've fallen into quite a bit of poetic reverie describing &quot;Ten&quot;, but that's okay.  My suggestion: If you are<BR>open to art that gently but intensely touches deep emotional and metaphysical truths, or if you love Cohen or Zen, or if you conceive of yourself as on a Path, this album is--to use a cliche--a &quot;must have&quot;.<br />(And by the way, the melodies and arrangements are concise and wonderful)

All the films youve seen about Vietnam dont amount to this. An accurate description of the american psyche in the one of the dirtiest wars ever conducted. And Herr doesnt mince his words, you get an \\"in your face\\" account of the facts, a gut-stirring story of brutality, dehumanisation, madness, agression and ...war.<BR>    Not to be missed.
B000008LOV|5.0|Criminally deleted at the present moment, due to legal<BR>wrangles between the various surviving stars and Warner<BR>Brothers Inc - this truly is a classic recording.<BR>  From the first take &quot;Handle With Care&quot;, through to the<BR>countryfied &quot;End Of The Line&quot; - there are many gems from<BR>each member - Dylan and Harrison being particularly prolific.<BR>  &quot;Handle With Care&quot; was destined to be a 12&quot; bonus track<BR>on George Harrison's 1987 single &quot;This Is Love&quot; (the title<BR>comes from an orange sticker on a box in Dylan's garage -<BR>where the song was written) - but Warners considered it &quot;too<BR>good&quot;.

The lyrical majesty of &quot;Tweeter and the<BR>Monkey Man&quot; is one of Dylan's best of the 1980s. <br />You can't go wrong guys.
0446678430|3.0|something about the author complaining about being broke and worring about the next year while he was on a ski trip just doesn't sound right. The long and the short of this book is own a bunch of assets, go into debt to get them if you have too, then write a series of books. <br />Some good information about changing your mindset, but I had already done that is why I bought the book.
B00003CXE7|1.0|It is most sad that so many people wasted their time on such a vapid film. They tried very hard to make it seem &quot;deep&quot; through the use of dream imagery and excessive computer whizzery. It was impossible to ignore the phonyness, particulary in the coliseum battles with tigers and the giant in the gold mask. It was way too obvious that extreme closeups, swirling camera movement, and overly zealous Foley(sound) effects were intended to disguise the truth, which was that nothing real was happening.<br />As for Russell Crowe, I am still waiting to find out whether he can act. In this film, his mutterings tapped into all the emotions he could express from A to B. Perhaps with a script, he might do better. Maybe when I see &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;, I'll find out.<br />I have always been a fan of action films, but this one, alas, was so contrived and obvious in it's use of two-bit trickery that no matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to believe in.<br />If an audience doesn't require more than this film delivers, then how long will it be before movie-goers just salivate and shout their approval just because a film was overhyped to the maximum extent possible. Has anyone ever heard the story of &quot;The King's New Clothes&quot;?
B00003CXXP|4.0|Being a Kubrick NUT, I was excited, yet scared by the prospect of Spielberg directing this...Other than the last 10 minutes, I thought he did a wonderful job on this...I enjoyed this more than anything he's released since the first Indiana Jones flick...<br />Visually, the film is STUNNING, and Haley Joel Osmond deserved an Oscar nod for this one (HE NEVER BLINKED!!! Creepy but effective).  Jude Law was a funny (yet again creepy) companion, in my favorite film I've seen him in.  The story could have ended 10 minutes earlier (those who saw the movie know what I mean), but otherwise, it's a beautiful film that I enjoyed immensely. I was enthralled by the story, special effects, and acting, and I though Spielberg had balls to make this one (was not a \\"Safe\\" bet).<br />I will say though that this film shouldn't be seen by young children (my son was 9 when we saw it at the movies)...this is an emotionally ripping film for young kids...I wasn't expecting the amount of intense emotion, and my son was in tears for a lot of the film (we had to wait five minutes after the movie for him to stop crying).  I was kinda watching it and living it through him, so I was in tears a lot myself.  (In case you're wondering, he liked it, but was freaked out by it).<br />So, highly recommended (I would have given 4 1/2 stars if I could...the ending kept it from a 5).  On my top ten movie list of the year, I gave it a 3 (Lord of the Rings & Ghost World came in at 1 & 2).
B000002JAX|5.0|Pity there isn't a sixth or a seventh star to rate this album.  Madeleine sings like Billy Holiday, but what a hell:she isn't the only one who tries it.The fact is: this is one the best female vocal albuns ever.
6305603847|5.0|This movie is the embodiment of how the human mind can be corrupted into degredation and insanity.  With no conventional dialogue, you find yourself sucked into Pink's inner psyche through the music of \\"The Wall\\".  Through the flashbacks and memories, you see how a madman builds his perfect isolation brick by brick, sealing himself from the pains of losing a father, an unfaithful wife, an overprotective mother, and the pressures of rock stardom.  You just can't go wrong with this abstract representation of the journey into the mind of a man who has lapsed into insanity.
0451527712|4.0|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was a fascinating book about a boy name Victor who was extremely interested in the field of science.  He began studying all the natural sciences, hoping that he could discover how to overcome death and decay.  He began working nights and days putting together parts of cadavers finally accumulating enough parts.  With all these parts he created a gigantic creature, a creature who ended up being the cause of Victor's misery and eventually leading to his death. As you read the book you begin feeling for these characters.  She had a wonderful way of describing all the details and everything, that you felt as if you were there and not just reading a book.  The story also has a lot of deep meaning behind it, which dealt with Mary Shelly's real life.  Altogether the book was a book that all readers should read.  It is the type of book that makes reading fun and enjoyable.
0823003035|5.0|This is a great book but definitely not for beginners. Eventhough I'm a beginner and will not get to this book for a while it's great to see what is possible with pencil and paper. This book certainly has increased my enthusiasm to pursue my skills in drawing and to achieve what is so nicely represented in this book.
B00003CXC6|5.0|The first time this movie told its story, I sat there almost bored, but the second time my interest was perked, and by the fourth time, I was mesmerized.  Confused?  This movie has that tendency.  It's basic \\"hook\\" is that 4 people tell very different versions of the same story, and each time you hear it, your faith in reality is shaken just a little bit.  Even in the end, you won't know left from right, but you'll probably have a grin from ear to ear. <br />Rashamon is a masterpiece because of the utter ease in which all this flows.  This movie often made me wonder just how on earth it was conceived and created in the first place.   The audience is effortlessly introduced to the story as if it were an after-thought, just some gossip between peasants.  A noble samurai and his loving wife are attacked by a ruthless bandit on the highway.  The samurai is tortured and killed, and the wife raped.  Or is that really what happened?  The wild bandit gives a very different version of the story, and then, amazingly enough, the dead samurai speaks through a medium and tells HIS version.  After all three witnesses speak, you don't know who is the villian and who is the hero.<br />And yet, amazingly enough, the movie digs deeper, and one of the peasants tells HIS version of the story, as he witnessed it from behind a bush.  As I sat watching this final telling in utter disbelief, I suddenly thought:  I have just watched the same thing 4 times in a row, and never once was bored!   <br />Of course, Toshiro Mifune gives a typically outstanding performance, yet this film is all about Kurosawa, the master director working behind the scenes.  Every shot and edit is in perfect place, nothing the director does undercuts his actors or his story.   There are no harsh angles like in Kubrick, or sappy endings from Spielberg.  Even the strong, general themes from directors like Ford are muted to serve the movie as a whole, complete story.  And what a story it is...
B00000K19E|5.0|Great action scenes and special effects! Wonderfully intriguing plot for a sci-fi, open up your mind and go along with the premise. My kids love this movie and turned me onto it. Think outside of the box for awhile and enjoy.
078322608X|5.0|The world of the future is infected by a deadly virus, it has killed most of the humans, and those who survived live deep underground, protected by layers of decontamination and sterility; the surface is now overgrown and overun by animals. Willis, an inmate in a prison is offered a reduced sentence if he goes to the surface to investigate and gather samples. What he discovers leads scientists to believe that in the past, (late 90s), a left wing anarchitic group &quot;The Army Of Twelve Monkeys&quot;, released the virus to wipe out human kind. He is sent back in time to stop the virus being released, but finds that time travel is an irregular science, stories of apocalypse are laughed at, and he, has more in common with the events surrounding the day of the Army Of Twelve Monkeys than he could possibly know.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a great DVD for people who are not too [uptight] about technique.  Laugh a little people...the scottish accent is priceless (not always accurate but remember, we are LIGHTENING UP!)  My son 2 yrs loves it (we of course skip via the magic of DVD past several scenes) Get it, kick back and let your inner child have a laugh!
031219126X|4.0|I enjoyed reading Frankenstein, but it wasn't at all what I expected.  I had all these horrific images in my head about some terrible, ugly monster.  Mary Shelley does not provide her readers with a descriptive image of what the monster truly looks like.  As I read this novel, my imagination ran free.  As different stories were told, and different emotions were expressed, the images and thoughts in my head of the monster changed.  The general theme conveyed is that Victor Frankenstein has to deal with the consequences of his creation.  He was so eager to creat life and a god-like figure, but once it was complete, he was disgusted.  He did not want to deal with his creation, nor have any relation to it.  Ultimately, Victor became his creature's slave.  Victor Frankenstein had to deal with many losses and hardships, but he stayed strong till the end.  At the end, the monster narrates his side of the story and after completing his &quot;job&quot; he disappears and goes back to being on his own.  Although the book started off a bit slow, it picked up and kept my interest until the end.  I would recommend reading this book, especially to those who have seen the movie because the book leaves more to the imagination and can be interpreted in many different ways.
6305603847|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have seen.  The music from Pink Floyd's The Wall tells the story of Pink, who is going over his life in a hotel room in LA....  The music fits perfectly in many of the scenes and the cartoon sequences are great, and Bob Geldof does a great job singing.  There are also some very strong political statemenrs in the movie.  All in all it is a great movie that should be part of everyones DVD collection
0345440900|5.0|I found Tracy's book after coming very close to a nervous breakdown when my twin boys were 2.5 months old. I needed help and anything would do. I had seen a news cast with Tracy Hogg bathing a baby and liked what I saw so I bought her book.<br />I've never read a book so fast. I am so greatful that Secrets of the Baby Whisperer was the book I found to help me. Tracy had so many helpful tips as well as a common sense approach to parenting that I really liked.<br />I've incorporated many of her suggestions and methods and now that my boys are 11 months old the proof is with them. They are wonderful nappers and sleep without my help. They know how to go to sleep on their own and bedtime is never a fight. They are very good eaters as well as being content, healthy babies. They know what's coming because of their daily routine and I think are much happier for it.<br />I have done all the work but without Tracy's help I still wouldn't know where to start. If you find yourself wishing your baby was born with an instruction manual get this book. It's the best how to book for babies I've ever seen. If I can do it with twins anyone can do it with one.

1556154844|5.0|I bought this book right after it was published and literally could not put it down. I demanded that our company purchase a copy for every software developer and make it required reading, and even offered to teach an in-house course using this book as the text.  One copy was purchased, the software manager skimmed through it, and it still sits on his bookshelf, gathering dust.  I no longer work there.  In fact, my consulting company was recently purchased by one of their largest competitors.  yee-haw! If you are a programmer, read this book, NOW!  It will make your life as a developer much easier for years to come.  I know it has made me a much more mature developer.  That means it takes me less time to develop and debug programs than many of my less fortunate colleagues.  Programming is both an art and a science, and this book will teach you to be better at both.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is perfect in every way. Back then, they had all the right ingredients. The most important one you ask? Easily, Cliff Burton. His influence is obvious on everything he appeared on. He shines on MOP and he is greatly missed. But that's not all, ALL of the other members put their heart and soul into this record and it will forever be remembered as the greatest album in metal.
0345440803|5.0|As a mother of 11 month old twins I found this book to be very timely. Tracy Hogg is a true voice for children of all ages. She shows us the mind of the child to help new parents learn to communicate and respect the little person/s in our lives.<br />As with her first book I found numerous tips and ideas to help me get through this age and stage of my boys lives. Parenting is such a large issue for everyone so finding a book that is useful and easy to adapt to my lifestyle is important.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone I know and can't imagine what I would have done before Tracy's voice helped me to see the way. My twin boys have slept, ate and lived by her words and I have the happiest babies I know living at my house. Thank you Tracy for all your hard work and dedication to the babies of the world.
B000003TAR|5.0|Wow...what can I say that hasn't been said already about &quot;In Utero&quot;.  Pain, suffering, angst, anger, frustration, bent up rage, confusion, all of these emotions and more were captured in this masterpiece of an album.  Though I believe both &quot;Nevermind&quot; and &quot;In Utero&quot; were great works, one must remember they each had their own significance.  While &quot;Nevermind&quot; was the album that came in and literally changed everything, &quot;In Utero&quot; was (and still is) viewed as Cobain's album of true lyrical genius.  Like I said in the title, this is a once in a lifetime masterpiece, rock fans will be hard pressed to find something that actually matches up to the caliber of &quot;In Utero&quot;.  Kurt Cobain left an incomplete yet amazing legacy behind him, and one can only wonder what he could of done in the future, R.I.P. Kurt Cobain.
B000005H7D|5.0|The Ultimate Blue Train is an excellent choice for the individual just beginning to explore jazz music. Coltrane is a giant and this piece provides great insight into his style and genius without overwhelming the new jazz listener. <br />Even more interesting to the jazz aficianado or those just starting out are the added features on the disc. The video footage, soundbites and interviews provide wonderful insight into Coltrane and his place in the jazz lexicon.<br />After a full examination of this disc, most beginners will flock to other Coltrane classics such as Giant Steps, My Favorite Things and A Love Supreme.
B00005JKED|4.0|I avoided seeing this film for the longest time because I thought it would be just another predictable anti-police drama, something along the lines of \\"Bad Lieutenant\\" with an L.A. setting. I was wrong. The film has plenty of unexpected plot twists and the acting is, for the most part, excellent. I've never been a big Denzel Washington fan -- too bland and boring (like Tom Hanks) and overly cautious (no sexuality, no explosive violence). He gives more this time, although it takes a while; the early scenes in which he tries to appear menacing are not terribly convincing. But when he finally gets into the role -- look out! And his intense performance is matched by that of Ethan Hawke; I was blown away. The gimmicky cameos are less effective; Macy Gray overacts, while Dr. Dre recites his lines as if he's not quite sure he understands what he's saying. Snoop Dogg fares a little better, but he's no Meryl Streep, either. Such cameos, which the director may have hoped would boost box office and enhance \\"street cred,\\" are merely distracting. And unnecessary. Denzel and Ethan are reason enough to see this film, one of the more memorable efforts of 2001.
031219126X|4.0|Since childhhod I always heard the name Frankenstein, but I never knew the story.  Up until I read the novel by Mary Shelley, I thought that Frankenstein was the actual monster.  Without seeing any of the movies, I had my own mental images of what \\"Frankenstein\\" looked like.  I always saw pictures or costumes of \\"Frankenstein\\" which made him to be this huge, gross monster.  Upon reading this novel, I learned that Victor Frankenstein was a creator interested in science and that the monster was his creation.  Even after I concluded my reading I did not have a detailed description of the monster.  So, I let my imagination run wild based on Victor's response to his creation, the monster's feelings of himslef, and on my previous images.  Mary Shelley lets her audience create the monster mentally and pictorally.  I also really like the manner in which the story is told.  It is told via letters and via conversations that share emotions and the history of the creation and its consequences.  The book kept me at the edge of my bed a few times.  I could not believe all the hardships and losses encountered by Victor.  I also could not believe his disgust with his own creation which he wanted so badly to create.  Throughout many points I felt bad for the monster.  My pitty for him and his alienation made me think that I was right in thinking that Frankenstien was the monster.  He created something he wanted but when he got the job done he did not end up liking the fruits of his labor.  I also really enjoyed the novel because of its contradictions.  For example, creating life using \\"dead\\" parts.  There are many different ways to interpret Victor's story and his relationships as well as his thoughts, feelings, and causes of his actions.  I thought that the novel was very touching at the end.  I really enjoyed reading it , and I'm glad that I now know the story of Frankenstein, and who the real monster is!
B000002KOQ|5.0|This is a great album - boy, is THAT an understatement!  When you think of Joni, you have to think of &quot;songs like tiny hammers hurled at bevelled mirrors in empty halls&quot;.  I LOVE this album. It was an awakening for me, personally, and I think that many other people feel the same way.  Magical!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I feel sorry for those who didn't get this wonderful film! You missed out on an exhilirating and intellectually stimulating ride! I don't think many \\"got\\" the purpose of the movie's unorthodox presentation and that's a problem for them. You see the reason the events are show in reverse chronological order is that we need to see things from the protagonist's (Leonard Shelby-fantastically portrayed by the able Guy Pearce in a role that should have garnered an Oscar nom IMO)  point of view. We need to experience the same confusion he's having as he desperately looks for clues on who ..murdered his wife. Why is that necessary?? Because the full impact of the truth that's revealed about his quest WON'T hit you as hard. Therefore the emotional connection to Leonard that you could have had will have been lost. It's a shame some don't get it. This movie is so much fun to dissect and discuss and reflect on the relationship of memory to our personalities. I have never found myself so immersed in a character or a film as I was with Leonard Shelby and \\"Memento\\" Congratulations to all involved in the making of this fabulous film-noir thriller-it is the masterpiece it's been so rightfully called!
B000001ESP|5.0|A very strong album throughout.  One of Rush's best.<br />The best drum recording of any album every made (and i'm not even a big drum fan).<br />Some good FM songs as well as some excellent longer material that reminds you of their earlier material.
B00003CXAR|5.0|Steven Spielberg's breakthrough hit gave audiences a glimpse at the future of one of the best directors in Hollywood history. A man who almost single-handidly made movies what they are today. <BR>Jaws is still considered his best movie by some fans and critics, it's acting, pacing and suspense are something movie fans should never forget, it's too bad films like Deep Blue Sea couldn't capture the magic quite as much as Spielberg did on this movie. Perhaps it was because Spielberg hid the creature so well and the fact the creature was a classic movie monster, a fake reality, whearas today's CGI is becoming too cartoony. Back in 1975, Jaws utilized a mechanical shark, which was often noticable, but still a reality, and far more realistic than the sharks in Deep Blue Sea. I don't think some filmmakers today are really making great movies like they use to, I think the movie scene is kind of falling apart, where people are interested in seeing Drama movies with boring resolves, instead of great entertainment. Spielberg is one of those who knows how to give movie fans a good time at the movies, and Jaws will forever hold a candle up for blockbuster-filmmaking.
B000050XEI|5.0|A wonderful blend of relaxing, soul inspiring music.  With the exception of Tempus Vernum (a bit on the 'dark' side), I loved all the numbers. Enya's crystal clear angelic voice can't help but take one to another dimension...another time...another place. &quot;Fallen Embers&quot; is my favorite.  As I listen to the poignant lyrics, I never fail to get tears in my eyes and feel chills running through my body. Anyway, this is a perfect CD to pop in the stereo after a long stressful day.  Open the windows, put on some candles, pour a glass of wine, AND....listen to &quot;A Day Without Rain.&quot;
0316776963|5.0|I have read books, the way some people devour bags of potato chips, all of my life.   In my younger, more pretentious days, I thought a book had to be depressing to be smart:  Sartre's No Exit, Camus' The Stranger, Kafka's Metamorphosis, stepping stones to the masochism of reading  feminist tracts,  spiraling ever downward to  the study of law and theology.  Then a friend lent me a copy of Me Talk Pretty One Day.,<br />I've paid my dues in France and laughed like a madwoman at Mr. Sedaris' take on the language conundrum.  I personally like myself and everyone else better when I'm in France for the reason he so brilliantly illustrates:  I don't know enough  French to understand when they're being nasty and I lack the vocabularly to wallow in my own customary cynicisms.<br />In the chapter &quot;Remembering My CHildhood on the Continent of Africa&quot;, the bit about the field trip to the Ethiopian slaughterhouse had me punching my fists into the couch pillows in a futile effort to stop laughing.   Ditto, for his rant about eco-capitalism.   I marked a half-dozen pages in a twenty-minute read so I could call friends and give them a laugh.  Hot damn!
0446677450|5.0|I've read a number of reviews here that comment on Kiyosaki's poor writing style, his obsession with money, his 'risky' investment schemes, etc.  If you focus on that stuff you'll loose the priceless concepts that actually are contained in this book.  If you focus on his underlying principles of how to wisely conduct your financial life, you'll get a lot out of his writings.<br />This book's goal is to help the reader get into the head of someone who is, or has the capacity of becoming very wealthy.  If you're open to changing the way you view money, at a very fundamental level, then this book is for you.  It doesn't list very many how-to's, and it doesn't recommend a specific investment strategy, rather, it introduces you to the thoughts that underly those specific strategies.  After reading this book, you'll begin to be able to create your own investment strategies.  If not, at the very least, you'll be able to recognize which strategy fits with the way a rich person thinks.  <br />Kiyosaki would say that taking two people side by side...a person who thinks in a 'poor' way and a person who thinks in a 'rich' way, take away everything they have, all their contacts, etc.  The rich person would very quickly build up a wealth base, while the poor person would stay at 0.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad explains what the difference between these two people is, and how you can become a person who thinks 'richly'
0440217563|4.0|I love her books and I've been particularly fascinated with this saga.  I've read the first four in this series and this is the only one I felt she took just a little too far with all the life changing experiences Claire and Jamie have to deal with.  But overall it is a great read and as always she writes some of the best books I've ever read in the genre.
B00005S8FC|5.0|I first heard this album on Radio Nova at of Paris and I was just amazed by this new sound. When hearing Latin music with a house background we have been accustomed to hearing Bossa Nova. Well this album takes it to a completely different level. Tango! The style of the tango ranges from very classical to very modern (voices) and the beats in the back are great. Although it has house beats, it manages to portray Argentina and the tango beautifully. I really liked &quot;Santa Maria del Buen Aire&quot; and &quot;Triptico&quot;. <BR>To enjoy without moderation. It is indeed the revenge of the Tango!
B000002UAC|4.0|This album may not be as great as Please Please Me, it's nowhere near bad. True, compared to &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot;, the rocking songs, like &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; are weak, but they're still good. However, in terms of great guitar playing, this is a keeper. Please Please Me had more vocal line hooks, but the guitar playing is incredible. I'm not a great fan of covers, but &quot;Til There Was You&quot; is amazing. It's an old Broadway song. This is done on acoustic guitar, and it sounds like George has been studying classical guitar for 10 years! Also, &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; is a good rocker. I don't really like &quot;Little Child&quot; and &quot;Hold Me Tight.&quot; They're ok. This is still pretty good, but I reccomend &quot;Please Please Me&quot; more.
0451527712|3.0|Overall, I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed reading the novel.  I was a little skeptic at first since it was written so long ago, and also because I already had an idea in my head of what the book should be like. Although the book started off slow and some parts tended to be very drawn out, it began to pick up towards the middle and it became much easier to read.  I liked how the author allowed us to see from the creature's perspective and were able to sympathize with him.  This was my favorite part of novel because it makes you want to find out what happens in the end.  The novel can definitely be related to society in the way that people that are not considered the &quot;norm&quot; are treated. I felt the novel was a good learning tool to different ways a book can be interpreted.
6301007360|3.0|Now - Before the the stones start flying,  &quot;Divorce, Ancient Greek Style&quot;.  What a concept!<br />For those in the dark:-  Our Myth, err gal [Medea] &quot;ups&quot; from her native country, [helps to chop up her brother - serious stuff here - along the route to make this 'look like a brutal kidnapping'], shacks up with this semi-Grecian godlike being - Jason of the Golden fleece ilk, bears him a few kids.  THEN the so-and-so starts fooling around with a local King's daughter [younger and hmmm... prettier], so our Lady, Madame Medea, plots a rather shall we say spectacular &quot;revenge&quot;  ..... the kids are snuffed out, the other woman gets this rather beautiful wedding dress [Odd, no return address on the box], just a little problem, don't try this one on &quot;for size&quot;, oh dear - she does, and the result is not fuzzy, but slightly, err - warm.......<br />There's more to this!<br />However, forgive the flippant tone, but that's basically the blue collar version of this saga of spectacular &quot;revenge&quot;?  AND No, Callas, does not sing in this one!<br />It's quite a magnificent portrait of ancient times, seen as only Pasolini could, in very &quot;accurate&quot; and raw terms.  Great Art direction [as usual] and Costumes [as usual]<br />CALLAS is superb!  As is Guiseppe Gentile as JASON [the two-timing husband].  Superb visuals - the bedroom scene between Jason and Medea as he posesses her physically and we get that great close-up ......just what is he thinking?  Also hints at her primitive and very different culture - wanting to &quot;pin&quot; the four corners of earth down so to speak.<br />Companions?  Melina Mercouri's rather interesting slant on this  - Jules Dassin's &quot;Dream of Passion&quot; with Burstyn - a  &quot;modern&quot; interpretation.<br />We do need this movie restored and on DVD!  [Along with the other missing Pasolinis]
0553106635|5.0|I have been reading fantasy for almost 10 years and rarely pick up a book outside of the genre.  This book has taken all my previous conceptions of what good fantasy is and thrown them [away].  <br />I have been an avid fan of both Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind's series for some time.  They had best clear way for this series.  The books talk about characters that feel real and that I have developed true feelings for.  I commend him for evoking that type of feeling in me.  Also, my perceptions of who is \\"good\\" and who is \\"bad\\" changes from book to book and even chapter to chapter.  The reason is because you get to see many characters individual perceptions of their own place in the world and how other people perceive that same person.  Very unique.<br />One word of warning, do not read this if you offended by coarse language, explicit descriptions of intimate encounters, or bloody (Braveheart style) warfare.  I do not think any of the above are excessive but I realize that some people are offended by this and thus, should not read.<br />Other than that, I feel the story moves along at a good pace.  Sometimes, it drags but overall, I feel it could actually go slower at times.  This is in contrast to Mr. Jordan who I feel has slowed down to divulge too much minutiae.  The adventure and risks of reading are real.  This is not a feel good hero with magical weapons and spoon-fed information conquers everyone and everything evil in the realm story.  <br />Magic is in fact downplayed.  This is another aspect I love.  Most of the story is about politcal maneuverings and how the characters are dealing with the dangers and forces that they have been set against.  Even minor characters have their part to play in the world and this is not missed nor dwelled on as some other authors tend to do.  <br />Anyway, lest I ramble more, let me sum up by saying, keep going Mr Martin.  Your books are wonderful and adventurous.  I will never hesitate to pick up the next in this series ifyour current style continues.
B000002X0Z|5.0|..hell on earth is one of the most hardcore albums of the nineties, second only to maybe the infamous. best tracks: g.o.d pt. 3, drop a gem on em, hell on earth, extortion.
B0000520Q2|2.0|Don't compare this so-so comedy with \\"American Pie,\\" which incidentally included unmemorable Seann William Scott.  For all those gross-out gags, \\"American Pie\\" is a good-natured film whose value is based on very classic, even conservative outlook of life.<br />\\"Road Trip\\" is not.  B-list actor Fred Ward is no hilarious Eugene Levy, whose well-intentioned advice all caused great laughter in \\"American Pie,\\" but it is no surprise.  For \\"Road Trip\\" is rude, crude, mean, and made by the people who don't believe in such words as love and friendship.  You may laugh or resent seeing four stupid college students doing politically uncorrect things, but it is all intentional.  You may laugh a lot, depending on state of mind or intelligence, but one thing is clear: none of the cast is going to get noticed to have a bigger chance, like Jason Biggs or Chris Klein from \\"American Pie,\\" because the film itself is like junk food or chewing gum.  It is easily digested and disposed.  Buy it, taste it, enjoy its flavor, and throw it away.  And as for Tom  Green, I have nothing to say except that his weird mannerism is getting unfunny. <br />If you wanna see lots of nudity including that of Amy Smart, go for it.  And you can see Tom Green lick a live mouse in his mouth.  But within ten minutes after watching it, you will forget anything about \\"Road Trip\\" except for those two scenes. And within five years, you'll forget everyting about the film and the cast.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I've always loved Phil's music, so I'm more than happy to own &quot;Hits&quot;.  My favorite song is &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, which has to be one of the most beautiful songs ever.  &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; is another favorite - that song is so haunting and beautiful.  I only own a few greatest hits albums and this is one of them, so that's saying a lot about this album.  An amazing album!
B00005AXEL|5.0|I have had this CD for a while, but had never written a review for it until now...A few years ago, I thought Stevie Nicks had lost her songwriting ability and was skeptical of how this album would sound even after the success of Fleetwood Mac's 1997 release \\"The Dance.\\" Well, the results COULD NOT be more pleasing. The haunting title track is classic Nicks. It is one of the best songs she has EVER written. \\"Fall from Grace\\" proves she can still ROCK as this is one of the hardest rocking Stevie tunes I have ever heard. \\"Love Changes,\\" which SHOULD have been the first single from this album in my opinion has a kind of Funk feel to it with it's slightly offbeat drumming and fantastic bass line and shows that Stevie still has a feel for perfectly crafted \\"pop\\" music(Reprise Records missed the boat by realeasing \\"Everyday\\" as the first single instead of this.) Planets of the Universe just smolders with it's chugging \\"working in a coal mine\\" like percussion (she quit doing this song in concert after 9/11/01 possibly due to the earily autobiographical lyrics \\"Looking up at skies on fire leaving nothing left\\") Sorcerer is perfect. Bombay Sapphires has a tropical \\"I want to sit on the beach with a marguarita\\" feel to it. A great summer song. \\"Love is\\" with Sarah Mclachlan is as haunting as it is heartbreaking.    <BR>It is easy to see why this album debuted at #1 on Billboard's Internet album chart and #5 on the Billboard top 200 making it one of Stevie's most successful efforts. Do yourself a favor and buy this album now...You will NOT be sorry
B00005T30L|5.0|I had few expectations going into this movie. I'm a long time Buscemi fan and that was the main reason I wanted to see it. I didn't know what it was about or anything. A friend of mine saw it before me and almost demanded I see it because, &quot;the lead girl is SO you!&quot; I've never been able to relate to any teen-driven movie so I figured my friend was exaggerating.<br />Let me say.. oh-my-god!! This movie spoke to me on such a personal level. I'm finding it funny, reading these reviews, the people who found Enid annoying or unlikeable..*grin* Seeing as, as I watched this film my jaw couldn't leave the floor. From the almost identical &quot;screw the world&quot; relationship with her more grounded friend Rebecca, to getting fired on the first day at a movie theater (for the same reasons), to her views on men, to her unique relationship with an out-of-sorts older guy... to well, everything. Its nuts. It's quite sad as well, but I'm just so thrilled that I've finally seen a movie I can relate to (how sick am I of the American Pie themed movies for those with no IQ? ugh). The comic was in print it seemed when I was in high school. I wish my friend and I had known about it then. It would've been nice to know we weren't alone in bleak ol suburbia...<br />Even aside from my overly biased opinions on this movie.. It was still great. All of the supporting roles were classic. From Enid's dad, to the art teacher, to the store owner, to weird al, to the infamous nun-chuck toting variety store dude (priceless!).. Everything seemed covered. Everyone was great. Steve Buscemi was gold and Thora Birch was fantastic! It's been a while since I got excited over a movie enough to come online and write some super long review on it. <br />I think many people can enjoy this movie on many different levels. Whether you spent your teen years rotting away in suburbia or not. It's an all around good, funny, quirky movie and I hope many more get to see it now that its available to rent.
B00000DGUG|1.0|Outside of &quot;Thank you&quot; the lyrics to this album sound like they were written AND sang as the music played in the background.  What happened?
0385335482|3.0|Definitely a page-turner from mid-book on, towards the end I suppose I really wanted to find out what was going to happen. The only problem I had was with Becky's &quot;compulsive lying&quot; behaviour, it got way ridiculous and totally unrealistic and she got very annoying. <BR>All in all, I recommend the book...<BR>Also, I do like Sophie Kinsella's writing style, it is clever and funny.
0767802659|5.0|While some say the storyline is cheesy and the acting bland, what remains is that Starship Troopers is one hell of an action thrill ride.  Based on the controversial book, Starship Troopers tells the story of a young man named Johnny Rico who joins the military so he can become a \\"citizen\\".  In fact, all of the new recruits are all real young men and women, but what they don't know is the horrors that await them.  Director Paul Verhoeven's patented penchant for graphic violence (see his other films Robocop and Total Recall if you wanna see what I mean) is in full effect here, human soldiers are dismembered in full gorey glory here, and the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a movie (and this was made in 1997).  But behind the excellent special effects and gut churning gore, there is an underlying theme leftover from the novel, the horrors of war and the loss of innocence when youngsters must endure it.  The ensemble cast includes Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey, Michael Ironside, Clancy Brown, Neal Patrick Harris, and Patrick Muldoon.  Highly recommended to any fan of sci-fi or action in general.
B00003CY5J|2.0|everyone i have spoken to who has seen this movie found it mediocre at best. i paid 2 full price admissions (me and my wife) to see it in the theatre, and came out thoroughly disappointed. with the director and cast involved, i expected greatness, or at the very least, entertainment. what i walked out with was a profound sense of disappointment and regret for shelling out hard-earned money for a lackluster (and really quite predictable) heist movie that got average performances from great actors (deniro, norton), and a laughably poor performance from a once-great actor (brando). what peeved me the most was the fact that edward norton seemed to have been typecast with an almost exact replica of the character he played in primal fear, which led to a subconscious as well as conscious premonition that blew the so-called surprise ending... four stars my heinie.
B000002GBK|5.0|Yes you can have it all! Classical music, Choral voices sounding as if the Angels came down from heaven. This CD represents the reason why you spent thousands of dollars on your audiophile equipment. Take an audio journey back to the middle ages with the London Symphony &amp; Choral.
B00005RIKD|2.0|when i learned Sting was releasing a cd from the Tuscany show,i was thrilled since his live renditions are usually better than the studio versions.my happiness soon faded to disappointment when i learned of the 3 different versions.of course,the U.S. version has the least songs.just 15.europe version 17,japanese 18.so i ended up getting the japanese import....it just so happened that one of my favorite Sting songs\\"Seven Days\\"wasn't on the U.S.version.why do the record companies do that?5 Stars for the japanese version.
1556589433|5.0|This film proved to be excellently suited for a course I teach on an existential/phenomenological perspective on \\"human pain,\\" (i.e., the anguish that accompanies merely being human.)The human condition is illuminated in all its aspects, from death to absurdity to responsibility and freedom and beyond, and the dramatic portrayals are outstanding, as is the film script derived from Styron's novel.
B00005QIPH|4.0|This CD is good overall. ok so if you heard &quot;Last Nite&quot; you'll completely love this cd.That in itself is the problem. The entire album sounds like one continuous song...i mean there are no great changes, the voice is always muffled, there is always the buzzing. I like this album very much but cant decide whether they are saviours, inventive, or just playin on the old nostalgia...&quot;just cant figure out&quot;
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I am not big on musicals but this one was INCREDIBLE! A rollercoaster of emotions - from amusing to romantic to tragic. The songs and performances were great! Ewan McGregor has an incredible voice and adds incredible emotion to his character, Christian, which I think is Oscarworthy. Nicole Kidman shows her diversity yet again in an outstanding performance. Who knew she had such a great voice. She has my vote for Oscar! To top it off, Director Baz Luhrman provides a feast for the eyes with a movie that was very well put together and directed. A gutsy movie for all performed in it! Hats off to all! A wonderful movie to own and rent!
B00005N83M|5.0|i really enjoy Jennifer's music. It's a good mix of R'n'B and latin music and every song will make you move til the end of the night. My favorites, &quot;Dance with me&quot; and &quot;dame&quot;.
0783225970|5.0|First of all I would like to start by saying that this is my favorite movie. When Palma and Pacino team up they are spectacular like in there other performance Carlito's Way (excellent film). As a matter of fact this movie is so good that this is the only place on the net where i can find it. This movie is an excellent drama about the rise and downfall of drug-dealing underboss Tony Montana (played by Pacino)not only is the movie good but the acting is also excellent. This movie definately deserves 5 stars, who ever gives it anything less dosn't know what they're talking about
B000003S16|5.0|Exposure is an excellent record.  It shows R Fripp's capablilities, and w/ the wide variety of guests, which appear on this album, you get a very pleasing record.<BR>I believe that in individual efforts, Robert Fripp really shines.  He shines w/ King Crimson, but in these individual releases, he too does a really good job.  Robert Fripp is the kind of person who would do allright in almost any musical setting.  He is a very disciplined and productive musician.<br />So if youre a KC fan or a music listener with an ear for good production and good songwriting I reccomend you this album.<br />(Also recommended, King Crimson's `Larks Tongues in aspic')
B00005JKQX|5.0|By the time you read this, the Oscar nominations will have been announced. <br />Certainly I'm no fan of Russell Crowe, especially with all the hoopla that he's so handsome (I find that very debatable, in my opinion) and talented (which is more likely). Hot off of last year's win as Best Actor for GLADIATOR (he only because of the oversight from THE INSIDER), Crowe has come again for a third consecutive nomination, starting in 1999 for THE INSIDER. Honestly, this has to be Crowe's most sincere performance that I've seen from him that's even worth mention (I only saw bits of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Crowe plays real-life Princeton teacher John Forbes Nash, who is suffering from schizophrenia. Along with Crowe is Best Supporting Actress nominee Jennifer Connelly, as his faithfully devoted wife Alicia Nash; Ed Harris as FBI agent Parcher; and Christopher Plummer as John's doctor, Dr. Rosen.<br />Based on the book by Sylvia Nasar, this film was directed by Ron Howard, who is nominated for Best Director, a correction for the snub in 1995 for APOLLO 13, and produced by his partner, Brian Grazer, from Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, their production company. <br />I figured that A BEAUTIFUL MIND would be a pretty good film, not just from good word-of-mouth, but from the story of a man suffering from a disease and his rise and fall and rise again. It sometimes goes into RAIN MAN territory by showing that Nash is somewhat of a genius, yet flawed. We see his early years in Princeton in the 1940s to when he won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994, his marriage to Alicia and the pitfalls they face during the terrible stages of his disorder. He soon suspects that Russian agents are out to get him, which is where Ed Harris comes in. Later, after he is institutionalized, we realize that Agent Parcher (Harris) and Nash's roommate Charles, played by Paul Bettany, and his niece are figments of Nash's imagination. We see that down period in his life. Then, his rise back up! He continueshis life with Alicia, they have a child, and Nash returns to Princeton to continue teaching. In the end, he gets the recognition he deserves as students give him their pens as a sign of their deepest respect of him, something he wanted since his student years.<br />The screenplay, written by Akiva Goldsman, has many great moments of poignancy, zing, suspense, and tenderness. While playing a game (whatever it was!) of putting white and black chips on a board, Nash is challenged by a fellow colleague. His response after being asked if he was afraid to play: \\"Terrified, mortified, stupified... by you!\\" It had a good comedic moment and timing there. Or when the \\"Reds\\" are chasing Nash and Parcher, there is some gunfire and car chases. And when Alicia begs Nash to realize what is real - that SHE is real - added dramatic punch.<br />In the end, I left the theater very impressed by what I saw. And even though I'm not a fan of my rival Russell Crowe, he has earned my sincere respects. Good luck at the Oscars, guys! <br />In the words of Russell Crowe at the recent Critics Circle Awards: \\"Opie done good!\\"
B00000JGEH|5.0|This classic piece of science fiction is one of James Cameron's best works, and better than its sequel, excellent though that is.  It begins in the future, with machines ruling the Earth, before backtracking to present day.  It turns out that the machines have sent back a cyborg in the shape of Arnie to kill the mother (Hamilton) of what will be the leader of a human war against the machines.  Yet the humans send back a human protector for the unaware Sarah O'Connor called Kyle.  Thus ensues one of the most compelling chase movies for a long time, with a dark plot that adds to a sense of despair and panic.<br />The acting is all spot on, with Hamilton being especially impressive as the ditzy waitress who suddenly has to come to terms with the fact that she holds the key to humanity's existence.  Surprisingly Arnie is also incredibly well suited to the menacing role of the terminator - the role that launched him into super stardom.  The action sets are all superb too, with some great special effects even by today's standards.  All this and there are some fantastic one-liners, some of which have deservedly gone down in movie history.  However, it is the dark nature of the story that really gives it the nudge above countless other such movies.  The city streets that the heroine runs through look wasted enough for the audience to consider if it's worth saving or not.  That the movie manages to tackle a romantic subplot successfully should also be noted.  This is one of those rare movies where looking back, it is still the genre classic now as it was then.
B00005YU1O|5.0|So it didn't get nominated for best picture, or even best animated film.  So it recieved a grand total of zero oscar nominations.  So what.  Here me now and listen later, take a chance and at least rent this film and I will personally guarantee that this movie will be on your top ten list for the year.  I may be toughest movie critic you'll ever read and this movie is #1 on my list for the year 2001.  See it once and you WILL WANT TO OWN THIS MOVIE.  You have no reason to trust me, but please, just take a chance on this one.  I don't have sympathy for hollywood studios when they don't make money, but this film actually deserves your dollar.
B00003CXS4|5.0|An interesting story full of unpredictable twists and surprises (you'll never know who's dead after a gun shot), and its dark humor is oh, so hilarious!  The multiple stories developing at the same time keep you in suspense of how they will merge together.  <br />The brothers trying to survive in the underground, the pawnshop owner and his friends who are such a clumsy criminal, \\"pikey\\"s with incomprehensible accent...its unique, dark, quirky, yet likable characters make the movie memorable.
B00005JKQX|4.0|Many argue this is the best picture of the year, and it very well may be.  Unfortunately, it's hard for anyone but a real critic to make such a claim, since it requires the viewing of every film produced in a year.  If A Beautiful Mind is indeed the best film of the year, then I might argue that perhaps it was a bad year for films.  I say this not because I was displeased by A Beautiful Mind, but simply because it did not live up to the expectations I hold for any picture that is attributed with the title \\"Best Film of the Year.\\"<br />And, indeed, there is much to like about this film.  It is a sensitive subject matter, and challenges the viewer to be jealous and frightened of the vivid life portrayed by actor Russell Crowe--and portrayed superbly at that.  It certainly must have presented a far greater challenge for the screenwriter and filmmakers to humanize the disease of schizophrenia and portray it in a manner that the audience would recognize and sympathize with.  It would be easy to show a man have delusions, but subtle touches where the audience observes Nash's calculations and his visualization of certain problems helps to convey the inner gift of the disease that a lesser film would have ignored.<br />Perhaps most admirable is the way the film manages to cover the delusions and schizophrenic episodes without ever causing the audience to chuckle or divest themselves from the character's problems and reassert them to the seemingly absurd situations on screen.  It is indeed easy to laugh when one does not experience such problems, but the filmmakers successfully erase any shred of jollity from the more somber moments.  Ron Howard's direction is apt to say the least, and truly does succeed at the moments when Nash's abstract psychology is in full swing for the viewing audience.  Prone to intense revolutions around our protagonist and appropriately showy montages of abstract thought, the direction conveys the intimacies of the mind as perhaps never illustratedbefore on the big screen.<br />However, not all aspects of the film will please--or rather some aspects that are missing from the film might detract.  In my own opinion, it was easy to start the film at Nash's induction into the Princeton doctoral program, however I was curious about what events lead to his malady.  It's easy to say that he came to college as an introvert, but what events caused that?  His parents were dead, the film tells us, but what bearing did this have on his personality?  So many questions about the young Nash and his association with people come to my mind that the film actually playing seems to be the second act of a longer work.  Moreover, the pacing comes across instantly as rapid and takes some coercion to get used to.  In the first few minutes of the film, Nash has apparently gone through years of college with little to know inflected transfer of time.  Obviously, much must be covered and the search for a film of tolerable length no doubt influenced both the neglected childhood years and the fast pace, but I certainly could have sat through an extended film to assuage my desires for the greater good of the film.<br />But, ultimately, this film is beyond well done.  Again, I cannot say that this ISN?' the best film of the year--it very well might be the best film in a bad year.  Regardless, something left me still inquisitive about Nash's malady, feeling that its depiction wasn't fully explained.  As a film that goes into the character's mind, however, perhaps nothing has ever captured and injected the audience as wholly and fluidly.  Indeed, special effects have never before seemed more apt than to represent the inherent and private visualizations of the human imagination.  And that is really what makes this film a success: the depth of character and the attention to the imagination that was never so much a factor in a film before.  This is a film about the mind, as the title appropriately decrees; see it for that and be prepared to experience another man's life in another man's mind.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The movie was trying so hard to stir our emotions-without any success-it was like encountering a high-pressure salesman (the more they push, the more appalling it gets).  Most scenes looked like it was borrowed from somewhere else, like a messy patchwork of all the past movies (especially Titanic and Saving Private Ryan).<br />The heroine is very beautiful, but the way she conveniently transfers her love from one man to another in a matter of months stirs no sympathy.<br />Also, the movie is strangely full of Caucasian casts while hundreds of native Hawaiians and Japanese-Americans also fell victim to the attack.  The existence of Cuba Gooding Jr. was almost like an after-thought with no effect to the plot and no memorable dialogue.  It is a dishonest depiction of history.<br />1 star for the spectacular special effect.
B00005T30L|5.0|I read Dan Clowes' &quot;Ghost World&quot; a few years ago, and fell in love at once. In a world of flashy, violent comics that all-too-often appeal to the lowest common denominator, a story that was just funny and human and real (in a slightly surreal way) was -- and remains -- a breath of fresh air. So it was with a mixture of excitement and dread that I anticipated the movie...I never doubted that it would be great if Zwigoff and Clowes were allowed to make it right, but I DID doubt that would ever come to pass.<br />It did, and if anything, the film exceeds my hopes for it. The film is much warmer than the comic, much funnier, but makes no concessions. It is a crowd-pleaser, but not because Clowes and Zwigoff have dumbed the original story down or made it more Hollywood -- they haven't. (There's actually a few very sharp jabs at chain video stores and movie houses that make it clear that Zwigoff holds the film industry in as much contempt as Clowes does the fanboyish world of comics.) Right from the start, Zwigoff allows himself and us to care for the characters in a way Clowes was never entirely comfortable with, even if his grudging love for them becomes undeniable as the comic progresses (&quot;Ghost World&quot; is the most accessible of his comics; his other work, while quite good, is so detached that reader identification is virtually impossible, and the characters are people you wouldn't much want to identify with anyway), and so the film actually takes the original story a step further. The characters are less grotesque, less alienated, which actually makes the world they inhabit seem that much bleaker -- you really feel they should be happy, and want them to be.<br />The story is much expanded for the film, and if it fails in any way in contrast to the source material, I did miss the presence of Rebecca throughout much of the second half of the film (her friendship with Enid is central to the entire comic). Even so, the introduction of Steve Buscemi's character takes the film in a similar but different direction than the original story, so not only can this be forgiven, and not only is it unavoidable for the new story to work, but it's actually a treat for fans of the comic, because it's essentially all-new material that's the comic's equal. And the performances...I've already gone on all day. You must buy this.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Looking and sounding better than ever is Hitch's masterpiece REAR WINDOW in this stunning collector's edition.  And the EXTRAS on this one make it a must for any collection.  The hour long documentary features interviews with Herbert Coleman, Pat Hitchcock, Peter Bogdanovich and Curtis Hanson; there's a photo gallery; trailers; the complete screenplay; and a stand-alone interview with the screenwriter John Michael Hayes.  <br />The Hayes interview was all too brief and it would have been great to have him on a commentary track throughout the feature, like Ernest Lehman did on the NORTH BY NORTHWEST dvd, but the recent book on the Hitchcock/Hayes films, WRITING WITH HITCHCOCK, more than makes up for that.  <br />It's Hitchcock at his very best.
B000003CMB|5.0|Duane Allman was quite simply the best slide guitar player that ever lived. This is his best work (with the possible exception of about a 3 minute section in Mountain Jam and the other live cuts from Eat a Peach which were recorded at the same time as this). This band set the standard for live performances and it shows on this album as it sets the standard for live recordings. I wore out at least 3 vinyl copies of this before it came out on CD. If you've gotten as far as reading these reviews go ahead and buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is the best movie on earth.The first time I saw it I couldn't sleep.I kept seeing the movie in my head over and over.The only thing I didn't like is that Rafe got the girl and Danny died.I think all actors/actresses played their parts very well.I give it two thumbs way up.
0345451325|4.0|I recently finished this book while away on vacation, and was very pleasently surprised by how well-written and indeed intriguing and satisfying this book was.  I picked it up just before we left, thinking that a little junk pulp fiction would be appropriate by the beach, but let me tell you the book is not mere pulp.  It is a prequel to the game, knowledge of or access to the game is not required in order to understand and benefit from the experience.  Certainly the book essentially ends where the game begins, but who knows ... the book may lead to a fulfilling experience in front of your tv/xbox combination.
0385040253|5.0|If I were to have to chose a book to be the Bible of knot tying this one is it. It covers many of the aspects of Marlinspike Seamanship and just about anything knot tying you might ever be interested in. <br />   There may be books with easier to follow directions for different knots, but this one is relatively concise and once you puzzle out how his nomenclature works you are well on your way to tying just about any knot in the book.<br />   This book is expensive but is well worth the price. It is a main stay of my personal reference library.
B00005UEAR|1.0|I was really looking forward to listening to this CD. I saw DT on the Scenes from a Memory tour and they were amazing and have liked all of their stuff, some less some more, up until now. But this has to rank as a disappointment big-time. Not only does the sound of the recording leave something to be desired, but the songs meander meaninglessly nowhere. To be fair, the 42 minute track on CD2 is the best thing on this, but I have listened to the first CD about four times now and it has done nothing for me. This is the general opinion of everyone I know who is a DT fan - even the diehards!!! These guys are excellent musicians, great songwriters - this is just a subjective view as I know that many people will love this, but it has done nothing for me and song-wise doesnt stand up to most of the stuff they have done in the past. I have recently bought albums by Threshold, Enchant, Flower Kings which are light-years better than this offering from DT. Shame. Too much time spent trying to be clever methinks.

0790734400|1.0|I really hated this movie. It was intended to be a spoof of 1950's horror films. But as other reviewers have pointed out, these movies are funny on their own-spoofing is redundant. This movie fails on so many levels its hard to know where to begin. Yes, Jack Nicholson's line about &quot;still having two branches of government working for you&quot; is funny. It is featured in the trailer and is the only thing funny in the movie. The rest of the film is a mean-spirited, humorless, ugly mess. Comedy high points include: 1) a group of children who run screaming as the aliens wield the Washington monument over their heads, eventually crushing them with it (Ha! Ha!). 2)The president's Golden Retriever barks at the foot of his bed and is then graphically incinerated by the aliens (hilarious!), and 3) a family watches their son burned alive on television and then the father says &quot;ah, that didn't just happen.&quot; (Following the film-maker's Hollywood logic, we know we can laugh at this family, because they have Southern accents and a conservative, pro-military viewpoint, and are therefore stupid and not worthy of our sympathy.) These are just a few of the many things I hated about this film. There are those who will say it was a spoof or satire and therefore &quot;it was supposed to be dumb.&quot; I would suggest that it is a dismal failure as either. If you want a good satire, watch &quot;Dr. Strangelove.&quot; If you want a good spoof/farce, watch &quot;Airplane&quot; or &quot;The Naked Gun.&quot; I can't think of any reason why you would want to watch this film. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth long after you've viewed it.
B000000H4V|4.0|Instead of speed and thrash Chaos A.D. is more polished and is a must for those who like hard progressive metal, but the lyrics will alawys stay angery. Good metal album, but I would not suggest this to anyone really into Thrash/Death metal who loved their earler works(Morbid Visions, Beneth the Remains) for that reson.
B00005QK3W|1.0|Oh I know. It's terrible. C'mon Paul! I am one of your biggest and long time fan. I've been waiting 4 years for a new studio album with all original material. What I got was a major disappointment. After Flaming Pie I was eagerly awaiting this new release. In my opinion you can write and produce songs like these in your sleep! It amazes me that many of the reviews on the Internet have been positive. One of the reviewers even went so far as to compare Your Loving Flame with Maybe I'm Amazed.I wish you would write something as powerful and poignant as Maybe I'm Amazed. I am waiting. The world is waiting. I don't think From a Lover to a Friend is it either. Where are the melodies and hooks in your songs? My feeling is that you are involved in too many projects and are creatively spread out too thin! Your bass playing is still top notch and it is the only reason I give this effort 1 star.The band unfortunately does nothing for you. And what's up with your voice? That screaming high register is rather irritating and it's got to go (as well as that hair color). In your desire to reach a younger audience you alienate many who know what you are truly capable of doing. I read advanced reports that you did many of these tracks in two weeks time. I suggest that next time around you spend more time perfecting them. The sad part is that these days we probably won't get another opportunity for a new studio album for quite some time. Oh well. Sorry Paul but I'm going to play Beatles 1 now and pack this misfire away forever!
B000000H5K|5.0|After creating some great metal CDs with Sepultura and after creating some explosive work with his side project Nailbomb, if he was ever going to leave Sepultura Roots was an awsome final albem. Roots is probably Sepultura's best work scence their releases in the late 80's.
0380788624|5.0|What I really liked about Cryptonomicon was that it felt well researched and gave a good glimpse (i hope) of encryption during WW2. Also, the intertwined stories are very good and keep you turning the pages. The characters are likeable and you keep wanting to know what will happen to them.
B00005R87Q|4.0|The Fast and The Furious DVD is defenetly a must have if you liked the movie.  It has a lot of extras that will keep you busy after you watch the movie.  The movie is an excellent action movie that delivers what it promises.  Do not expect a flawless story or intracate plot, but it does have some excellent acting and direction.  Good sountrack, nice looking cars (lots of imports and an awesome Charger).  Add it to your DVD collection.
B00005OM4N|5.0|THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME CD EVER FROM ANYONE, ITS SONGS ARE GREAT AND THE SINGER (BRITNEY) IS EVER BETTER, AND EVERYONE DESERVES THIS CD! AND FOR ALL THE RUDE COMMENTS ABOUT IT, ARE FROM JEALOUS PEOPLE WHO ONLY WISH THEY COULD BE COOL OR TALENTED LIKE BRITNEY. SO MY ADVISE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DONT LIKE HER IS GET OVER YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE NOTHING AND WILL AMOUNT TO NOTHING AND YOU ARE TRYING TO TAKE YOUR HOSTILITY OUT ON SOMEONE WHO IS BETTER THEN YOU. LOVE THE CD!
0375507507|1.0|It's very difficult for someone to say of a book with little to no vision or perspective, that it is good. You sit and read this book and are frustrated by the complete lack of focus. Why was Fuller writing this and for whom? DLGTTDT is considered a memoir but it fails even there as all you get is a continuous loop of alcoholic mom (but boy is she funny or what?), racial epithets, pictures of the &quot;natives&quot; (there're other less nice names for them)and other pastiche from the well-worn world of colonial english literature. About those natives. We have pictures of them in their &quot;native environment,&quot; quiet and meekly smiling for Ms. Fuller's camera and yet no recording of their voice. Well why stick their photographs in without a mention of who they are? One can only speculate and again that brings us back to that shop worn world of romantic Africa in the English tradition. It's bewildering. Obviously Alexandra Fuller realizes how empty in fact her account was and how incomplete, superficial and wanting. She neither succeeds in telling her own story and certainly not the story of Zimbabwe during the period in which her family lived as settlers. This is very unfortunate. No doubt she has something to say but for some reason is unable to say it.

B00003CXI1|4.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have read each of the books four times...so when I went to see the movie it was with a lot of expectations...and yes I do agree with a lot of the reviewers that the movie did not capture all the magic of the book and the axing of characters like Peeves the Poltergeist was dissapointing. But that being said, the sheer thrill of walking a while in Diagon Alley and seeing Hogwarts loom large and clapping and screaming through the Quidditch match was something that made every minute in that dark hall worth it.<BR>Most people go to the movies expecting the film to live up to the book in every way. But that is rarely if ever going to happen. Harry Potter has excited the imagination of a generation and the images we conjur up in our mind's eye are ours alone...just because Chris Columbus could not translate a million fantasies exactly the way we want it does not make this a bad movie...we must remeber that JK Rowling was with him on this film every step of the way...and however much you find fault with it you are touched by the magic of Harry Potter and his motley band of friends...I would definitely reccomend the DVD...and let a little of the magic touch you too.
0140072187|5.0|This is the first book any of we Army aviators ever saw written about our flying experiences in Vietnam.  It is our bible.

B00000DC10|5.0|From start to finish this album is great. When I first heard this album I actually thought it was a new release and actually had hope for the future of Rock and Roll, but later found out that this was released in 1998, and have since broken up. where was Mtv or radio on this one, this is why Rock music is in such sad shape.This album has so many different textures to it,from hardcore punk to blips of techno to emotional. The production is raw and yet, has a warmth to it.The performances from each band member of the material is first rate and genuine,the guitar work is incredible,and rocks as hard as anything out there.This album is a milestone in hard aggressive music,in my opinion it stands there with Nevermind and Pretty hate machine.This album should be considered in the top ten greatest Rock albums of all time and definately of the past 10 years,and one of the finest punk albums ever made period.I am definately going to buy the first album which I have never heard before, but judging from this album I am sure it will come through.I am now a Refused fan.If you are a fan of Heavy metal, Punk,Alternative, industrial or play an instrument this album will deliver.The title of this album is so aptly titled and if this is the case and this is the shape of Punk to come,then Punk will save Rock and Roll without a doubt, what a shame that this band is no more.

0800103661|3.0|Gattaca explores one of the neglected dangers of cloning. While eugenics would actually populate the world with largely benign and perfectly healthy and intelligent people, society would have to become more sophisticated to match those who populate its upper levels.  Those who don't meet the standards of the society in \\"Gattaca\\" would fall through its cracks, creating a sort of techno-apartheid, bigotry right down to a science.  Ethan Hawke is one of those unlucky 'godchildren' ' born into a sterile future from natural and not in-vitro fertilization. Talk about being born under a bad sign, a post-natal DNA check confirms that Hawke's character will have cardiac, neurological and vision problems and will be unlikely to live past his 30's. (Hawke's father, in an understated but heartbreaking moment, stops the doctors from letting the poor boy become his namesake). Fruitlessly dreaming of becoming an astronaut for the vaunted Gattaca, Vincent ('Hawke's character's eventual name) is confronted with a cruel reality of being 'invalid' ' one of the lower castes reserved for those of bad genes. (To maintain the genetic-ghetto, the police routinely test DNA make-up based on hair, fingernails, dandruff, blood and urine analyses of suspects.) The only spaceships Vincent has any hope of seeing the inside of are the ones he cleans as a janitor. Desperate, Vincent enters the identity black-market, an underworld where Valids on hard times sell their DNA perfect ID's to upwardly mobile invalids. To counter the police, these 'identity-smugglers' provide the tools that will allow Vincent to match up with Jerome Eugene Morrow, a valid crippled in an accident and reduced to wheelchair-bound and alcohol-fueled self-pity. Vincent has an ambitious plan ' using Jerome's identity, he will re-enter Gattaca (he had once mopped floors there) and become an astronaut. Despite his humble beginnings, Vincent has his fraud well-mapped: he excels as a navigator-trainee and is chosen for an eagerly awaited mission to the moons of Saturn. He takes his fraud very seriously ' careful to leave bits of Jerome's stubble and nail clippings at his work station. At first, everything works out ' not even the coldly analytical director of Gattaca (Gore Vidal) nor an even colder fellow-trainee (Uma Thurman) with whom Vincent falls in love suspect that he is really an invalid. With less than three weeks to the mission, disaster strikes ' one of Gattaca's directors is found dead, murdered and somebody is not only responsible, but has inadvertently left some physical debris behind. The only clue the police have are bits of skin fragments traced to Vincent ' but as far as anybody knows, Vincent hasn't worked in Gattaca in years, and nobody can immediately connect him and Jerome. However, a persistent detective with his own interest in the case throws a tight cordon around Gattaca, convinced that Vincent is hiding among the Valids, hoping to ferret Vincent out. Determined to go into space, Vincent uses every trick he can to stay ahead of the police.<br />This was a great idea for a movie, which is why it loses something in the translation ' Hawke is excellent as the genetically imperfect 'invalid' who uses his desperation to surpasses expectations, but once he becomes Jerome, his story boils down to the tricks he uses to elude detection. The script does little with possibility that Vincent, though it's unfair, really has no place in the advanced society. Uma Thurman is too cold to match Hawke as his love interest. Instead, the script pairs up Jude Law as the 'Valid' who rents DNA to Hawke. At first it's a business proposition ' Vincent's wages can help the drunken Jerome maintain a semblance of his standard of living. Further down, Jerome finds a more symbiotic basis for their relationship.  With the crippled Eugene officially holding a position with the vaunted Gattaca, he can face down anybody who would have dismissed him. Unfortunately, Jerome becomes more self absorbed, undermining what should be a climactic moment in which the wheelchair-bound Jerome must pose as his physically-whole self. What really kills this flick is its vision of a future as if conceived by the guys who do the artwork for Esquire ' with this new age looking like a sedate version of the swinging '60's, complete with electric-versions of period cars, steel and wood architecure, and a cooly non-techno version of just about everything. (Alan Arkin's character, a detective, looks as if he's walked off an episode of 'Naked City'; astronauts fly into space while wearing Armani suits) It's stylish, but the style overwhelms the substance. A botch, but not one you should resist.
B00003CWL6|4.0|I loved this movie when it came out.  But when I saw it again on cable, I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes.  It was just boring the second time around, and already seemed, as one reviewer wrote, too obvious.<br />I think that one test of a movie should be whether you would enjoy seeing it again (maybe I'm wrong?).  For example, I've watched Magnolia over and over, and each time I'm stunned by the performances.<br />So, five stars on first watch, three on second, and four overall.
B00005UKKF|5.0|All Brit Fans should get this DVD, it's hot!! ohhh.... I just hate her Non Fans coming her and dissing her.  They are just jealous of her beauty.  Who cares she lips snync??  It's hard work to be up there dancing half naked and singing.  If you don't care for her, then why watch and complain???<br />The only problem with this DVD is that It don't have extras, like the other Britney DVD's.  Yeah, it's HBO that's why.  I was excited thinking that we get a long preview into her New Movie or the making of... NO!!!!!!!!<br />That's because it's not by BRITNEY It's by HBO.  All it had was the Concert.. Oh well....  That's HBO for yous.......  <br />Good concert!~!!!!  lot's of fancy stuff.... yummy!!  just wished that put some extras in the DVD for us fans!!!! btw  I was waiting for Brit to come out in that Evis uniform.. drool!!!!<br />The waterfall scene was smoking!!!

B000005ALP|5.0|I survived the 80s and the Liverpool scene, man that was wild (evil grin).<BR>This band ROCKS! Nothing I personally have listened to in the past 5 years has come close apart from the Cosmic Rough Riders. In shear quality of the lyrics and guitar riffs, man I love the guitar and harmonica, what a combination.<BR>I first listened to Novocaine on compilation CD (bah CD still albums at my age,) all I can say is buy it; you're a fool if you pass anything by this band.
0451527712|4.0|If you are expecting the novel Frankenstein to be like horror scenes depicted in the movies, you better think again. Instead, Mary Shelly allows the reader to create more images in his or her own mind. Today, we are so brainwashed to violence and gory images on television, that we sometimes forget what \\"real\\" horror used to be like.  When you read Frankenstein don't forget that Mary Shelly wrote the book in the 1880's in a time of social unrest. The writing style is different, and the pace of the novel is not as up to date as modern books.  Her descriptive words allow the reader to create the monster in his or her own mind, without actually seeing it.  When Shelly writes, her words give such detailed images of what is going to happen next. For example, when something \\"bad\\" is going to happen, Shelly generates a spooky and mysterious setting.<br />  One of the major themes throughout the book is science technology. When Victor creates the monster, he is challenging science, and therefore challenging God. When the creature awakes, Victor realizes that he has just done a \\"horrible\\" thing. He is disgusted with the thing he created, which led him to feel extreme guilt and compete rejection of the monster. Is it science that led him to self destruction? Shelly wonders how far will technological advances go before a man becomes too dependent on technology? Science destroys his life because the monster dominates him, and Victor winds up being a slave to his own creation.<br />  What was also interesting about the novel was how Shelly made the reader feel sympathetic for the monster. After all aren't we supposed to hate this thing? She portrayed the creature as a \\"normal human\\", showing love and affection. The creature's ugliness deterred anyone from coming close to him, and made him feel like an outsider. This rejection from society made the monster sad and helpless. His only revenge was to engage in destruction. This is when the \\"real\\" monster is created.  After reading parts of the novel I felt bad for the monster, in a way I never thought I would.<br />  Although slow paced, Mary Shelly's style of writing will allow you to take on different dimensions and force you to develop your own profound ideas about the topics discussed in the novel. I think Frankenstein is a great Romantic classic for anyone who has a  imagination.ding parts of the novel I felt bad for the monster, in a way I never thought I would. <BR>   Although slow paced, Mary Shelly's style of writing will allow you to take on different dimensions and force you to develop your own profound ideas about the topics discussed in the novel.

B00005JKYS|5.0|I was priveledged enough to view the movie at a premeire at West Point last night.  It was awesome, and it was so moving because most of the real people were in attendance as well as many of the stars to include Mel. While there is comic relief used well at times, the movie will keep all on the edge of their seats. I am glad to know that these men's story will finally be told to America. As a future officer in the United States Army, I am proud to be following in the footsteps of these heroes.
B00004U8P9|5.0|First of all, TRHPS is not your every-day musicial like annie or the king and I, it is a musical for more adult audiences.  The first time i saw it i was shocked at what i saw, transvestites, gays, and domestics.  Over time i became hooked.  all i've got to say is the DVD is a must own for any rocky fan.  the sound is remastered, for the maximum rocky experience, and it is loaded with extras, like commentary by Richard O'brian and Pat quinn, interviews with cast members, outtakes, deleated scenes productions photos and oh so much more. In short if you're not a rocky fan this DVD will convert you.... AT THE LATE DOUBLE FEATURE PICTURE SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Im just going to write a short comment now.<BR>These cd's are both great, the first has some great songs, especialy Misunderstood one of my favorites, but im not realy gonna comment on each song, because it's not nececcery because everysong on it is good, the playing is awesome like you can espect and this is the kind of music your usual band can't make bacause DT have the talent to do it, that's why i have to disagree with some of the people here who say they should write more song less showoff but this is no showoff it's just that they are using what they can do, they could make these Creed songs and nickelback songs evertyone seems tobe making now, but it's to easy everone could do that, and they're not in it to do that and make some hits, but most of their songs should be hits but they requare attention, you have to realy LISTEN to them, but the music market is controlled my idiots and young people who(most of them :( ) dont realy listen to the music just buy what is on the radio and so on. i resently read that only 5% of western people where realy music fans, who who realy listened to music and buy's it and i think this 5% is for exemple listening to DT and more challenging bands like them and also bands like STP, AIC, Soundgarden and so on but just buy this cd and you wont be dissapointed because it's realy kicks [butt], it's both heavy and light, and good lyrics and the songs are long so you have to pay attentantion and listen to them ok thanx guys, keep up the good work :)
0345440900|5.0|I loved this book because it has helped me to understand my baby and know the best way to care for her, especially when it comes to sleeping/napping and feeding. Tracy does an excellent job of explaining her &quot;E.A.S.Y&quot; and other philosophies which help parents to establish a loose routine for their children to help them become happy and healthy babies and to help parents to know how to read their babies' cues. I love the section where she explains the different cries that babies make and what they mean. I never before thought about how my baby's hunger cry was different from her tired cry. It also helped to read the chart of what the nonverbal signs are that baby gives when he/she is tired, hungry, overstimulated etc.If I hadn't read this book, I would have been so much more confused about figuring out what my baby needed. Tracy's ideas make sense, and they work! I have worn out the pages of her book because I used it so often as a resource during the first 8 months of my baby's life. She gave many examples and scenarios that explained exactly what I was experiencing with my baby. I highly recommend this book. I just got her second book for Toddlers, and I can't wait to read that one as well.

031219126X|4.0|There is a certain image that is attached with the name Frankenstien that just makes people all over think of a mad scientists creation that is 10 feet tall with bolts on his neck, green skin, and viens popping out all over. In reality, Mary Shelley had a much different picture painted for readers in her book Frankenstein. Shelley does an amazing job of depicting her story of the creator whose name is Frankenstein, not the creatures, journey through his own psychological difficulties. Her use of imagrey and detail makes it and easy read for high school, college students, old and young alike. It is a classic tale of what goes around, comes around and in the end, you pay for your decisions 10 fold.  There is continuious adventure and mystery learking with each turn of a page, and this keeps the reader on the edge. This novel is one of adventure and drama, and I give it a 10!
B00003CXDZ|4.0|As the camera pans out on Ewan McGregor's bearded, haggard face as he sits at his typewriter, typing a classic story of love, betrayal and woe, you know this movie's gonna be comething special. And that's what it is. Something special.<br /> The plot is essentialy this: A British poet moves to France and finds himself in a position to write a play for the Moulin Rouge. Soon thereafter, he falls in love with one of its stars, Satine. But the play and the Moulin Rouge will not go on unless a certain Duke invests his money into it. The catch? The Duke is also in love with Satine and doesn't know about the secret love affair between the poet and Satine. Mayhem, chaos, tears and betrayal ensue.<br />A surprisingly potent love story is placed inside a red-hot bottle of music, dance, colors and vibrancy, and splashed across your movie screen with love as its foundation. Will everyone like it? Certainly not, the film has a certain over-stylized energy about it which may not sit well with everyone (I personally enjoyed most of the film's unique camera trickery, but did get lost in its frenzy from time to time), but anyone who loves musicals is sure to at least appreciate Mr. Luhrmann's bold approach to reviving this lost genre of films. The first half an hour of the movie is especially strange, and many may think \\"What the Hell am I doing here?\\"? But the movie soon reveals itself to be beautiful, powerful and intoxicating in its own way.<br />If Nicole Kidman is not at least nominated for an Oscar for her stunning performance in this movie, there is no justice in thsi world. She invests in all emotions, making the audience really empathise with her character, devliering catchy, upbeat and sometimes moving remakes of pop songs with apparent ease. However, Ewan McGregor's moving performance as the infatuated lover is not to be forgotten, and his voice is surprisingly strong. Perhaps we'll be seeing him in the charts sometime soon?<br />Make magic. Give your senses candy. Go see this movie.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I'm new to Incubus and this is the first album I have bought from them. I had previously heard Fungus Amongus and scarcely S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself. I must say though they had some cool things I wasn't particularly interested. They seemed to me just an aggro band with cool licks, something funkily inspired (Primus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More style) and evolved into something from the family values tour. And I don't dig aggro too much. In fact, I don't dig aggro at all. Then I heard they were mellower and I thought perhaps they were more digestible. And they were. This cd blew me (Typical term, used yet again, Ha!). And made me understand the increidble band Incubus is. This may sound like crap to older fans, because I have noticed the whole change and growth Incubus has experienced throughout it's years as a band, and I know that there are always people that stick to the same type of music for ever and ever, and feel this like treason. But this is not so, it is only maturity. Morning View sounds much mellower than it's predecessors (there are of course harder songs: Circles, Blood On The Ground, Have You Ever, Under My Umbrella and perhaps Nice To Know You) and the use of strings and acoustic guitars in various of the songs does contribute to that fact. I find the whole cd beautiful. And Brandon BOyd's lyrics and vocal range surprises me.  The band itself has so many attractive ingredients. Grunge, Funk, Metal and Rock, Progressiveness, Groovyness, etc. It's a cool band. And great musicians too. It's perhaps true that Dirk Lance (or Katunich or whatever his real name is) does not do pyrotechnics he used to do with the bass, but he serves a greater purpose now, in a greater band. Dj Lyfe or Kilmore rules, he is great in melding his groove into all the music absolutely well, complementig the sound rather than making it chaotic. Pasillas II is a great drummer in his own right and knows the moves alright. and last but definately not least Mike Einziger(that's how it's spelt?) completes the core of the unique sound that Incubus is. He's a bit mad, just as my favourite guitar player Steve Vai is (and, wow! Mike likes him too! and Steve even gave him the instrument and the inspiration for Aqueous Transmission, the last song in the cd and a real experiment and cool song to hear indeed! experimenting with eastern orchestrations and in such an accomplished ways). All songs are increidbly great, my favourites being Circles, Wish You Were Here, Echo, Are You In and Under My Umbrella and the whole cd is a morning view just as the onde depicted on the cover. it makes you feel that way. Just as Make Yourself reminds you of that interstellar spacey feeling. I love this album and definately recommend it for lovers of any genre really. It's cool and relaxed and tender and passionate and aggressive and poetic. Whole 5 stars. And be sure to check EVERY other ingubus cd's and dvd's, they rule.
0790729628|5.0|After Antonioni's Blow-Up, Blade Runner is my favorite film. The special effects are dated (no CGI) and the film editing is staid (compared to, say, \\"Matrix\\").  But compared to the Star War prequels, it does illustrate how to integrate the special effects into the movie instead of the movie into the special effects.  I mean the actors actually seem to know where they are standing.<br />While Blade Runner, like Blow-Up, can be appreciated as a genre film, consider Blade Runner as a meditation on what it means to be fully human (first recognize that, if we are not born human, then we must become human through experience and/or empathy). Art conceals art here.<br />Film as an art form fascinates me because it alone marries the visual image moving through time with musical notes moving through time (if you mention opera here I'm going to mention all the options provided by film editing and music editing and not even bother to mention the fat lady). Few directors have understood this as thoroughly or exploited this as effectively as Ridley Scott. Films are, for me, a sensory and therefore sensual medium. If a film does not please my eyes and ears, intellectual gimmicks remain just gimmicks (think Memento here). A film, like a painting, must have a presence (forget Heidegger and just think of presence as charisma) that attracts and holds my attention by its appeal to my senses. Possibly because Scott started out in commercials, he is an expert at attracting and holding attention, at creating a film with presence. (Hey, if it looks good and sounds good and transcends itself with story and theme, maybe it is good. Lose the critical theory like Dogme 95.  Do I care if it is a hot or cold camera?  No, I only care that it works as a film.)<br />It surprises me that few reviewers here have mentioned the innovative Vangelis score and the years it took before it was released as a CD.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I suffered through this disjointed story the day it came out. Save your time and money.
B00005R87Q|3.0|\\"The Fast and Furious\\" is another typical look on deep-cover cops that investigate speed demons.  The film is pretty much \\"Point Break\\" on wheels.  And then and there is when I become confused and Disaipointed with the silly plot.<br />Paul Walker plays Brian, a hunky and adventurous speedster, who is also, a undercover cop.  He seem mysterious about a cute girl, Mia (Jordana Brewster) and her shady, order-giving brother, Dom (Vin Diesel).  It turns out to be that Dom is a leader of a street racing gang, bent on money and their half-ass obbession with \\"Nos\\". Brian already has a bone to pick with the gang's thug, Vince, and the ability to be \\"accepted\\" into this gang, by street racing Dom and his hot, red, suited up Mustang 3-4X.  He loses, of course. Brian ended up beting on the race with his car's pink slip instead of money.  After a shoot out between a rival motorcycle gang, lead by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune), Brian's car is ruined...but he gains respect from Dom, after he rescued him from the cops.  It is then we find out that Brian is really a cop, working undercover to solve a case, involing Road Warriors whom steal contriband from semi-wheeled trucks.  The rest of the film is about tust, loyalty and of course, action.<br />\\"Fast and Furious\\" Never ceases to slow down.  The plot moves too fast (no pun intended) and the characters never seem to develop, besides Diesel's character, in a suposively dramatic sequence when he talks to Brian about his father's doom and his violent past.  Most music fans (including me) will be disaipointed by how rapper Ja Rule is only in the film for less than 10-minutes and not even his character (who seems not too far from what he may be like in Real Life) is fully developed; heck, his character isn't even apart of the story, by far.  The only thing that will get people to see this movie is (of course) the fast cars.  Why don't you just watch NASCAR???
B00003CXI1|2.0|I'm sure you have seen how many stars I put down and said \\"What? How can anyone give this movie 2 stars?\\" Well that's the thing about movies, some people will like them and some people won't. But since this is a review I feel I need to explain my opion and how it is based on more than simple opinion. Also let me point out that I loved the books, I'm not just a Harry basher who wants to rain on other's parades. The books were so full of emotion and urgency and consequence, I would find myself cringing or gasping out loud when the characters were in danger or laughing and grinning like a fool when something great happened. That emotion and passion that I felt in the books is what drew me into them and made me feel like I was a part of it, it is why I love to read and why I love movies, the emotion grabs you and drags you into the story making you feel like you are really there. But when I came out of this movie I felt like I had watched a story, not like I had been part of one like I usually feel after coming out of a good film or reading a good book. I actually felt dissappointed and so I explored why that would be and this is what I found. The Movie was incredibly detailed and to the letter of the book, but I think this may have been it's downfall. Because of all the time necessary to show all of the information there was precious little time left for character development, or for showing off the more emotional parts of the story. It was kind of like someone was sitting there saying \\"Ok we have 2.2 minutes for the scene where Harry looks at the Mirror...Go!\\" In the books I felt that Voldemort was this epic, evil villain who could enslave the world if he were to return, I felt he was dangerous and at all costs he had to be stopped. In the books I felt that Dumbledore was this Mysterious and benevolent pillar of good and right, a pillar of strength for the heroes in their times of need. And in the books I felt like it was a race against time to stop whatever evil wastrying to break into the school. But in the movie there was so little time to show the emotions the characters were feeling or to extrapolate on the strengths and natures of the characters and events that I think they missed out on all of that passion and depth. In the movie I felt like Voldemort was just another bad guy who did bad things, I didn't even get the impression that most people would know who he was. I did not get the impression that Dumbledore was anything more than a doddering school master. And I never felt like anything was at stake, I never felt like there was something serious going on. Overall a very cool movie with some great visuals and stayed very true to the book. But it did not have depth or emotion, nothing to draw me back again and again. I think that a little creative liscense by the director and the screenwriters may have been necessary, taking out a bit of straight information and filling the space instead with some character or story development would have added to the depth and made it feel more like a world and less like a picture show. Just my two cents.
0446525537|5.0|I saw a preview for this movie on TV, and it looked really good. So I got the book, and I was never the same. The book was great. I stayed up every night reading it, wondering what will happen next. Some parts make you laugh, some make you smile, and some make you cry. It is about a boy named Landon Carter who is pretty popular. There is a girl in his school, Jamie Sullivan who is the minister's daughter and is not popular and spends all of her time doing things for others. One day, Landon is calling up people to go to the dance with, and no one will take him, until he calls Jamie. Jamie and him go to the dance and then they start spending more time together, only to fall in love. And then something unexpectedly happens, and Landon tries to search for a miracle. I would reccomend this book to anyone. I can't describe how much this book changed me on my view of life. Read it! Trust me... it will be a walk the library that you will remember!

1878424319|3.0|This book was less than I expected. There is good practical advice - like cultivating distance from your own thoughts and other people's words and replacing old ideas with new beliefs. However, there's really nothing new here, it's more of a common-sense book, and I see little, if anything, that hasn't been taught many times over by other popular authors and most major religions. I prefer the book of wisdom by Taro Gold called &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life.&quot;
0553266306|4.0|through out this book from the very beginning your sucked into the aftermath of world war II in France. After a long fought struggle for Algeria the current president of France wishes to sighn Algeria over to the Arabs. In the novel you follow an assassin code named the Jackal. Through out the book you follow the Jackal as he sets up a near fool proof hit on president De Gaulle's life. This is the first book, or story for that matter were you can be either for, or againts the protagonist. The day of the Jackal is good book.The only thing I absolutely loathed about this novel was the use of French phrases, that made no sense to me. This is most likely the only one I'll ever legitimately read.<br />I most definately suggest this book ;)
B00005O5JV|5.0|This is funny and fresh. New and exciting! It's number one in my book!
B000000W6F|5.0|This album was the Pumpkins second best.  I seriously think that Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is a bit better and so is Siamese Dream.  This song has many heavy rock songs such as I Am One, Siva and Rinocerous.  Tristessa (stated on this page as Fristessa) is a very slow rock song.  This is the best.  Buy it and try to persuade another person into buying it!  Worth it's money.<br />P.S. Gish was re-released and the re-released version off Virgin Records has much better quality that the Caroline version (the original one)
B00003CXTG|5.0|This film is awsome, I totally recommend it. Its so inspirational and somewhat sad but a good ending. Its about Love, Friendship, Faith and most of all Honor. It's a wonderful movie for those who know how to appretiate a film for its value and meaning not only what happens with the relationships.<BR>It's a wonderful film, great value and worth every penny.
B0000560X3|4.0|I LOVE DVD-Audio.  But I am noticing an unusual trend.  Some of the songs are either different takes or are remastered so differently that they begin to lose similarity to the originals.  MACHINE HEAD is a case in point.  The famous SMOKE ON THE WATER has a totally different lead vocal than the original had.  Simply A/B the DVD-Audio with the CD and you will hear the difference.  Yet I cannot slight the sound on the DVD-Audio release.  It is absolute dynamite.  Warner took a 30 year old recording and made magic.  The sound is very realistic and not gimmicky.  A++ (5 stars) for sound quality.  I only wish that the original version of Deep Purple's super hit was here...'cause it's MIA.
B000056K04|1.0|I understand Dave Matthews was attempting to try something new with this album, and I respect that.  He had a pair of balls on him for going in this direction, but it didn't work.  Millions of DMB fans are throwing their hands up in rage at the pop-oriented sound Dave has tried to swing on this new CD.<br />It was an experiment.. it didn't work.. and the new DMB album will be fantastic, as his old stuff always was.  Nothing to worry about.
0380796090|2.0|Watermelon was a fun book to read -- I finished it in a day.  But after reading Keyes's Lucy Sullivan, I was disappointed in Watermelon.  Although both books had many of the same elements, I had a hard time relating to Watermelon's Claire.  Claire's husband tells her that he is leaving her while she is in the hospital, having just delivered their first child.  Claire flies home to her parents and sisters with her new baby and begins to heal.  Only Marian Keyes can make a plot like this with laugh out loud humor.  This is a book about heartbreak, survival and the importance of loving and supportive family.

0441008356|5.0|Anyone that likes high technology, science fiction, a good story that is extremely well written - buy this book at once. Also buy the sequel Chasm City which is set slightly further into the future. What is most amazing is how the story makes you believe that the amazing technologies - both casually mentioned and explained subtly, but in great detail - actually should exist. Why dont they? I ended up feeling that I wanted all those toys - lots of nano-tech stuff in there.
B000002UAO|5.0|All but maybe a few song titles [What Goes On, I'm Looking Through You, Wait] are definitively staple Beatles content more or less recorded at their prime. This album I believe ranks easily among their top quarter of studio releases. If compilations are nice additions to your CD collection (which to me they are to a certain extent), multiple tracks included on Rubber Soul are ones not to be found on any of their Greatest Hit discs. These being `The Word`, `You Won't See Me` (an exception on 1992 Box Set but very expensive), `Think For Yourself``, `If I Needed Someone` and `Run For Your Life`. They are songs that keep respect for this album and help retain its prominent position along Rock's timeline. So lay back and listen to the CD, appreciate the talent of a band that never will be forgotten and apart from your better half and other favorites, reflect how/why All You Need Is... The Beatles.

I definate must for all rock fans in any format.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I've never traditionally been drawn to science fiction and \\"techno-thriller\\" films. One notable exception to my lukewarm attitude toward science fiction films is a 1984 James Cameron film that I consider to be one of the very best of its genre. \\"The Terminator,\\" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn, is a very, VERY good film indeed!<br /><br />Before this week, I had pretty much forgotten just how good \\"The Terminator\\" is. I had seen it in the theater in 1984, and perhaps two other times on VHS in the years that followed. I was re-introduced to the film recently when I received in the mail my latest order from Amazon.com: a \\"Special Edition\\" copy of \\"The Terminator\\" on DVD.<br /><br />This film is just as good now as it was seventeen years ago! It has lost none of its intensity, none of its non-stop, heart-pounding excitement, none of its originality. Recently, as I watched \\"The Terminator\\" for the first time in perhaps ten years, I found myself once again transported to the dark world created by director/screen writer James Cameron, and brought to life by Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, and Biehn.<br /><br />Five minutes into \\"The Terminator\\" (counting the opening credits), and the screen literally explodes with action and excitement as the Terminator relentlessly hunts his prey, catches up with her, and finds himself coming face to face with her protector. Watch the spine-tingling, non-stop action as our protagonists constantly try to elude their predatory robotic nemesis, and the Los Angeles Police Department gamely tries to figure out just whatintheheck is going on here anyway?!?<br /><br /> The acting in \\"The Terminator\\" is actually pretty good. Certainly not Oscar-contending material, but definitely of a lot higher caliber than I expected the first time I saw the movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his first role of real substance (and the role that made him a box-office star) proves that, yes indeed, he really can act.<br /><br />Linda Hamilton is excellent as Sarah Connor. Her evolution from a cute, all-American girl, to a victim of a seemingly random crime, to a disbelieving participant in a battle through time, to a woman of substance with a tortured soul and highly developed sense of responsibility, is gradual but quite noticeable, and an excellent acting achievement.<br /><br />Michael Biehn is also very good in his role as Kyle Reese. He delivers his lines powerfully and demonstrates a wide spectrum of on-screen emotions. Like Schwarzenegger, he possesses tremendous physical acting ability.<br /><br />\\"The Terminator\\" conveys a certain \\"film noir-ish\\" feel that greatly adds to the film's overall suspensefulness, tension, and excitement. By design, most of \\"The Terminator\\" was filmed at night. The result: a dark, almost sinister atmosphere prevails.<br /><br />Although it's seventeen years old now (as of this writing),  \\"The Terminator\\" remains an  intense, exciting film, imbued with a highly original story line, excellent special effects (at least for its day), and pretty darn good acting to boot.  A \\"must own\\" DVD for \\"sci-fi\\" and Schwarzenegger fans alike!ilton is excellent as Sarah Connor.

B000000993|5.0|To start this review on a high note, i believe tool is the best band in existense, so this review could quite possibly be very biased. And if you are a tool fan and have not purchased their 3rd album, \\"Undertow\\", you are missing out on some of their greatest work. When i first purchased this cd, i merely listened to the title tracks (Sober, Prison Sex, and Intolerance) and pretty much neglected listening to any others. Yet, when i finally ventured out and listened to the whole album, i was stunned. Every song is an experience within itself, and shouldn't be missed. In conclusion, if you think this is good stuff, take a listen at \\"Aenima\\" and \\"Lateralaus\\", if you haven't already.
0743216458|5.0|In the late summer of 2001, before the terrorist attacks of September 11th turned every American's world upside-down (gosh, that seems like an eternity ago now!!) a ten-week mini-series began on the Home Box Office (HBO) cable network.  That mini-series, entitled \\"Band of Brothers,\\" told with exquisite eloquence the story of one of the most famous U.S. Army units to fight during World War II.<br /><br />The book that forms the basis of this particular HBO mini-series is \\"Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest.\\" Written by noted historian and biographer Stephen E. Ambrose, it is, in every way, an extraordinary book!  Imbued with Ambrose's trademark simple eloquence, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is an uncommonly powerful narrative of one of the most storied units in U.S. Army history: Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.<br /><br />That unit had  its beginnings on the hot, swampy training grounds of south Georgia; fought its way with uncommon courage on some of the bloodiest battlegrounds of Europe during World War II; suffered over 150 percent casualties during its illustrious wartime career; and disbanded in the summer of 1945, only a few weeks after the defeat of Germany.  By the end of the war, Easy Company was one of the most decorated units to have fought in any theater of operations.<br /><br />My review here cannot even begin to do justice to Stephen Ambrose's magnificent narrative in \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  This book  is a real departure from the kinds of books previously written by Ambrose.  In his other works of history, books like \\"Undaunted Courage,\\" \\"D-Day,\\" and \\"Nothing Like It in the World,\\" Ambrose casts a historian's dispassionate, unbiased eye on his subject and relates his story with complete neutrality.  Not so in \\"Band of Brothers!\\"  This is a personal story... one written to cast a spotlight on the brave men who served their country so bravely and nobly on the battlefields of Europe in World War II.<br /><br />Ambrose introduces us to men like Herb Sobel, the incompetent martinet who was Easy Company's first Commander; Dick Winters, the complete antithesis of Sobel (and Sobel's nemesis as well) who became so beloved by the men of Easy that they followed him anywhere; Lewis Nixon, another brilliant officer who, despite being plagued by alcoholism, proved a tremendously capable and courageous leader; Carwood Lipton, the company first sergeant, another extraordinary leader whose courage and example eventually earned him a battlefield commission; and other noncoms, like Bill Guanere, John Martin, and Shifty Powers, whose courage under fire held the company together during its darkest hours.  In every case, Ambrose helps us get to know, and I mean really KNOW,  the patriotic men who were the heart and soul of Easy Company.<br /><br />Ambrose's descriptions of battle are second to none in this book.  Relying on first-hand accounts of Easy Company veterans (Winters, Lipton, Guanere, and Powers among them), Ambrose has constructed a narrative that brings the reader right into the heart of battle.  I found myself completely captivated by the accounts of Winters leading his patrol against the German 88's; and the heartbreaking losses in Holland and the incredible suffering during the siege at Bastogne.<br /><br />\\"Band of Brothers\\" is a relatively short book, running to just over 300 pages.  Each and every one of those pages comes alive with Ambrose's brilliantly constructed narrative, written in his simple yet eloquent writing style.  Fair, judicious, and yet warmly sympathetic to its subject, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is as good a book about war and the courageous men who fought it as one is likely to find anywhere.

B000000H3W|4.0|ARISE by SEPULTURA is a great disc full of thrash and speed. SEPULTRUA are one of the biggest and baddest of all the metal bands to come out of the 80's and ARISE shows us how much they rock. This is the first SEPULTURA CD that I have bought and I just think it rocks!!! Just listening to the first 6 songs: ARISE, DEAD EMBRYONIC CELLS,DESPERATE CRY, MURDER, SUBTRACTION and ALTERED STATE the listener gets his moneys worth.  This is the perfect disc for people that love their music loud,fast, and in your face. No weak spots here. After listening to this, I am getting ready to go and get some more of Max-era SEPULTRUA albums. Rock on
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I definitely recommend this CD.  If you're a fan of Sade's, you know top-quality music; expect that on this live album.  Her tour was much more than a promotion for her latest CD, &quot;Lovers Rock.&quot;  This live album includes some songs from her latest (not to mention great) effort and many of her classics (although I do regret to inform you &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; is NOT included in this collection).  Her voice sounds great live; as a matter of fact, it's superior to her studio sound.  The soothing instruments and acoustics add to her mellow voice and create a perfect CD.  Every song is well worth your time (in particular, I strongly recommend: &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart,&quot; &quot;Smooth Operator,&quot; &quot;Jezebel,&quot; &quot;Kiss of Life,&quot; &quot;The Sweetest Taboo,&quot; &quot;No Ordinary Love&quot; and &quot;By Your Side&quot;).  &quot;Lovers Live&quot; will also be released on DVD.  That DVD will include *all* the songs on her tour.  If that interests you more, go for that.
0446677450|5.0|I am a 35 y/o computer person. As I grew up, my parents told me to go to school and become an engineer, or an accountant, so that I could have lots of money. I grew up thinking it would happen, and my belief got stronger when I chose a profitable computer carreer. However, I spent 15 years working on computers, with many over-time hours, and lots of time away from friends and family because I was learning newer technologies to try to make more money. <br />However, I never got rich, I made good money but I was never able to accumulate more than $5,000 on my bank account. I never understood why after working so hard, money was still a big concern! I figured out that there's gotta be another way to become wealthy. I gave it my best shot at studying and working hard, and years went by and things didn't get better. <br />I started looking for information on wealth accumulation books, and a friend of mind recommended this book. This book has been very enlighting, I wish I had learned the principles shown in here  15 years ago. If I had, I know for a fact that money would not be a big concern for me today. I feel much better now because, even though I don't have lots of money (not yet), this book pointed me in the right direction.<br />I also recommend \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" by Napoleon Hill. It goes deep into detail about what to put in your mind if you want to become wealthy.<br />I hope my review helps.
0060930187|4.0|This special novel passively sat on the bookshelf in my study for sometime. Over the months, occasionally, it would wink at me... I would pick it up, thumb through its pages, read the odd line or two, and place it back on the shelf. On a Sunday morning last week, I read the beginning line for the first time:<br />\\"It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York. I'm stupid about executions.\\"<br />Needless to say, I read ~The Bell Jar~ from start to finish, and have had a suspicious and disturbing dark cloud hanging around me ever since. This dark cloud mingles with intermittent light, but the shadow of the novel's themes moves into my vicinity like a suspected stalker, waiting in the corner, seemingly ready to pounce without warning. This may well sound a tad too dramatic, but their are novels out there that have the power to influence your state of mind in profound ways. This novel, for me at any rate, turned out to be one such book.<br />The story is a realistic account of a young American girl's descent into madness.<br />Similar to many great American writers, her prose style is deceptively simple. Plath's writing is extraordinarily translucent, enabling the reader to vicerally connect with her inner most thoughts and feelings. This aspect of the novel was highly enjoyable rather than the actual story itself. Sometimes reality is difficult to look at...<br />As a poet, Plath is acutely sensitive to the world, and as sensitive people are forced to do, they create social masks as a defence mechanism against the vulgarities of existence. This reminded me of the Aestheticism of the Irish writer and poet, Oscar Wilde: the poet's task in life is to be a seeker of beauty - the art of life, or the life of art, the aesthete or poet equates with a form of purified ecstasy that can flourish only when removed from the vulgarities and sterotyped world of actuality. In the case of the novel's protagonist, Esther Greenwood, it was a confrontation and eventual withdrawl from the vulgarities of 'male culture'. The mask she created revealed itself as an unkind, almost flippant attitude to the people around her. Because she must be true to herself, (as poets must be) her actions or inactions with the people around her caused tremendous guilt, thus the vicious circle begins: an acute sensitivity to the world and self; the creation of a false mask as defence; the inevitable guilt for not being true to oneself, leading to eventual self destruction.<br />There are no knights in shining armour in this tale. Sir Galahad riding over the hill on his trusty stead to save poor Esther Greenwood from herself and others. On the contrary, most of the major male characters in ~The Bell Jar~ (apart from her father who is dead) are pathetic losers: coarse, insensitive and self absorbed.<br />~The Bell Jar~ Plath's only novel before her tragic suicide, thrust her directly into the feminist arena, making her a feminist 'icon' in American culture. This accolade is well deserved as this book is a major contribution to the cause, exposing male dominance and oppression, (more so then, fortunately, than now) and illustrating that women are not simply baby machines, cooks, house cleaners, and mere objects for male sexual gratification.<br />After finishing this book, I couldn't help making a comparison to Viginia Woolf's modernist masterpiece, ~Mrs Dalloway~. In this novel, similar themes are explored: male vulgarity, the arrogance of the medical profession, and madness.<br />This is an important book for many reasons, least of which is its literary contribution to American letters.<br />Highly recommended.st, Esther Greenwood, it was a confrontation and eventual withdrawl from the vulgarities of 'male culture'.

B00005B36H|4.0|Let's make it known now that I am a big Tool fan. I have been ever since I heard 'Part Of Me'. I have anticipated this release with near 'star wars' phenomenon fervor since the day 'Aenima' was released. Suffice it to say, I am a little disappointed with this cd. It would have been excellant if released a year or two after 'Aenima' but waiting 6 years for a near carbon copy of said cd was a bit too much. After repeated listenings though, you get into the mix of it and really appreciate it for what it is. And what is it you ask? A grand jesture of heavy metal meltdowns. Take all of the 'new' metal and forget about it. No rapping, posturing, nookie nor cross culturization. What you get is meat and potato(e)s heavy music. If you love them, you already have the cd and know it well by now, if not I suggest you buy it now and treat yourself.
B000002GF8|4.0|Amid the schlock and synth-pop that polluted the airwaves and record stores in 1983, this was one of the better albums out there at the time. Quite good stuff. Everyone';s talked about how good &quot;Every breath You take,&quot; Wrapped Around Your Finger,&quot; and &quot;King of Pain&quot; are, so I'll leave them alone. But I loved the title cut, it was something different, as well as &quot;Tea in The Sahara.&quot; Nice atmosphere. <br />Now for the much-maligned &quot;Mother.&quot; To tell the truth I LOVED this song. My college roomate had me rolling on the floor with laughter whenvever he played this! It's in the &quot;so bad it's good&quot; category.<br />But overall, this is a worhtwhile purchase. Enjoy.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie held true to the book, which I thought was impressive.  Although a lot of the smaller details were left out, I can understand due to the over all length of the movie.  But there were enough major events included, that someone who hasn't read the books, could follow the events.  The movie and all the special effects presented were amazing.  The time went by so fast and really kept you involved with the story line.  I do wish more of the childrens inter play and conversations were seen.  As this reconfirms and helps define each character.  In some ways, the special effects over shadowed the characters at times.  But I wouldn't miss any of the future movies. Each of the characters are beautifully played and come to life before your eyes.  Just as you picture them while reading the book. The costumes, sets and special effects really helped you connect with the story line.

0688078958|4.0|English is a tough language to master.  There are so many exceptions to the rules that it is a wonder so many people can ever become fluent in it.  But the complexities of the language almost make it so wonderful:  it is a language of incredible diversity that is able to evolve and adapt to changing situations.  It is great for wordplay and it is great for literature.<br />Bryson's book illustrates the wonders of this language and discusses English's history and the quirks it developed along the way.  Why do we pronounce colonel with an &quot;r&quot;?  Or use a &quot;w&quot; in one?  Such items are discussed within?<br />This is a language appreciation book.  It is filled with fun facts.  If I rate it at four stars, it is not because of the material, but because of how it is presented.  There is some redunancy in the book, almost as if each chapter was written independently and then tied together later; there are also times when he refers to an upcoming chapter when really he means a previous one.  Finally, although this is a matter of personal taste, I prefer my citations in footnotes, not in the text itself.<br />Despite these problems, I do recommend this book to almost anyone who can read English.  It is a great way to make any English reader appreciate his or her language.
0395177111|5.0|I chose to read this book because many peaple told me that it was interesting.  When I started to read the book I learned that this was true.  I also started reading this book because I heard the name Hobbit in a movie commercial for the lord of the rings.  I also started to read the book, because when I read the summary at the back of the book, it seemed pretty interesting.<br />   The main character is Bilbo Baggins.  This creature is a Hobbit.  They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality.  And Bilbo was no exception.  At first, he did'nt even think about adventures.  But when the story nears the end,he wants more to go on more adventures.He is a very funny and intresting charater, with many good qualities.<br />   I like this book very much. This is because it is in a whole different world, where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. I like science fiction books because I like learning about different creatures and places. The Hobbit is probably one of the best books I've ever read.

6300214826|5.0|I thought this film to be the finest work from Coppolla ever. From the very beginning with Sheen's husky intro and the Doors playing in with the napalm horizon to his whacked out dance and fantastic fan edit, to the very end, I loved this film. <BR>I can understand people's problems with historical inaccuraces  but didn't care; so what, it's a work of fiction. Embracing the horror, saying that one has to be insane to do such as everything we learn in normal society is completely truned around...self pretentious? So what. I thought that everything about this film was damned close to flawless. As for those that were dissappointed with the end, I MUST disagree. To see the whites of Sheen's eyes come through in the amazing sunset, to Brando's dying words, the doors again playing in the background, down to when Sheen sticks his head out of the water, it's perfect. I think that many find parts of the film difficult to interpret and therefore it often gets a bad rap. If you're looking for a great war moive get De Palma's 'Casualties Of War'. If you want a truely original, astounding cinematic experience, get Apocalypse Now. It's a traversty that it didn't win more awards, maybe on the second time round.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Really, truly amazing music here.  I LOVE this lady's beautiful sound.  I could listen to it over and over (oh yeah, I do).  If you haven't already listened to this, don't make the same mistake that i did!  RUN, don't walk, to get this CD!!
0786880708|5.0|Jon Kabat-Zinn has produced a wonderful book with Wherever You Go, There You Are.  Compiled from his years of work in the field of mind/body medicine, Kabat-Zinn offers an easy to read format for using mindfulness meditation for health care issues.<br />This books format allows for easy, and quick, readings with short blurb like sections.  Simple, everyday language conveys the deep and profound message of applying mindfulness meditation to your life.<br />Most importantly, this book is presented in a way that encourages you to try the technique.  All too often we read a book as fast as we can, so we can get the knowledge and go on to the next book.  Kabat-Zinn interjects sections where we can apply what we have just read into our life.  In this way we are able to begin new habits, this time healthy and good-for-us.  I highly recommend this book and hope you enjoy it, and the resulting benefits, as much as I have.
1559408898|4.0|This is a very well done, ultra violent, sci-fi movie.  The scary thing about it is some plot elements that were considered outragous during its release (mid 80's) is now more realistic:  privately run prisons, corporate police forces, artifical organs with competitive prices, totally automated real estate shopping and domestic terrorism.<br />However, some of the most hard core fans of this movie have never realized that the basic storyline is based on the old Lone Ranger serials and television series.  Both have the basic plot of a law enforcement agent being killed by his own to hide a crime.  Then, the left for dead agent coming back to avenge his death and bring his assilants to justice.  Here are the parallels if you can't spot them out.<br />Texas Rangers -- OCP<BR>Lone Ranger -- Murphy<BR>Indian Magic saving lives -- High Tech/Cybernetics imitating life<BR>Tonto -- Officer Anne Lewis<br />Also there were several very blunt parallels.  The visor Murphy wears is made to look like a mask.  His gun draw is identical in style to that of the old Lone Ranger series.  I don't know if Vanderhoffen have admitted to this parallel but anyone that I have pointed it out to has agreed with this observation.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When Moulin Rouge came out in the theaters, I had absolutely no interest in it, just from the previews.  Even when it came out on DVD, I had no interest.  Then, I started hearing reviews on it.  Almost every review was the same:  You either love it or you hate it.  Ok, well, after hearing this a few times, it really peaked my interest.  Why not give it a shot?  What the hell, I had nothing better to do with my time.  Even though I am a fan of musicals, I expected a lame, sappy, feel good movie with actors that couldn't sing.<br />Was I ever wrong!<br />This is definitely one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  It's visually STUNNING.  But even more than that, the story is GREAT!  I found myself laughing and crying, all at the same time, throughout the movie.  I wasn't prepared to hear just how vocally talented Nicole and Ewan are.  WHO KNEW???!!!  <br />I DEFINITELY recommend this movie to ANYONE, especially if you are a fan of musicals.  I expected to hate it, but now I can't wait to see it again.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Perhaps Billy Wilder's best. Combines humor and pathos, with great acting -- particularly Fred MacMurray as the creep. Billy and I.A.L. Diamond (Billy's co-writer) made one of the best movies of the 20th century. It's right up there with Citizen Kane, High Noon, Casablanca, and -- surprise! -- The Stuntman and The Wild Bunch, among others.
B00003CX5P|2.0|This movie was a mockery to all true hardcore starwars fans.  It's not that it is that bad of a movie but i think we were all a little disappointed in this one.  Maybe it's just me but i would have a higher standard coming from George Lucas himself.  Jar-Jar Binks is what sealed the fate of this movie for me.  I don't know about you but after waiting so long since the first series i think ol' George might have lost his touch.
B000002BQK|5.0|Butterfly has more of an r&amp;b-ish/urban edge to it but the songs still remain as soulful and as enjoyable as we have come to expect from this diva extraordinaire. The ballads on this album such as the title track are very stirring as Mariah showcases her vocal prowess with such amazing intensity... but yet she maintains the integrity of each song with the right amount of gentle restraint. She also demonstrates quite skillfully her ability to tackle various styles of music in songs such as &quot;Breakdown&quot; in which she effortlessly glides through a tongue-twister of a song with Bone-Thug-esque beats. This will surely be an r&amp;b classic album
B00005NKK8|5.0|This Collection Is A Wonderful Set For ANY Music Library.
B000002AVF|5.0|Mariah at her finest. Perfect mix of radio pop and soulful r&amp;b. Sure to satisfy fans of both genres. A definite must-have in every cd collection.
B000051XX6|5.0|Before I received the normal CD version of Lovers Rock, I had to admit that I was not a Sade fan. In fact, I kind of hated her music. But one listen changed all of that!<br />Lovers Rock is so haunting and beautiful. Sade is in my opinion the best female vocalist in popular music. Her voice is amazing smooth and sensual, it's as if she embodies the many faces of love itself. And the music is just as powerfully soft as her voice.<br />It's hard to select tracks that are better than others, but if I had to, I would rank \\"King of Sorrow,\\" \\"Every Word,\\" and \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart,\\" as the very best. Truely every song is great.<br />The entire album is great, weither you're sitting alone in a dark room with headphones, or if you're lying in bed with the one you love. And SACD makes this album even better. I had purchased a DVD player that had SACD and DVD-Audio capiblities, and I wanted to test them, so I bought the SACD version of Lovers Rock. Let me tell you, if you want to try out what these two superior audio formats can do, test it with this album. It really allows you to appreachate who well produced and enginered this is. In fact, I liked a few tracks better once I heard them in SACD, especially All About Our Love.<br />If you have SACD equiptment, get this version, if you don't, the normal version is still fine to listen to. But you'll definately want to invest in buying this album again for SACD. Either version, Lovers Rock, well, Rocks!
B00005B36H|5.0|This CD is not for the usaul pop culture listener.  This CD can open up your mind and let you fully relax.  TOOL are artists!  The only other artist I can relate this to would be Pink Floyd.  In a way its the &quot;Modern&quot; Pink Floyd, as the aspects of their music are mostly the same.<br />Its worth the money!
B000056N8X|4.0|NOW i KNOW SOME PEOPLE(ACTUALLY A LOT !0 HAVE SLATED THIS MOVIE.<BR>I have come to a conclusion about how Connor can still have the prize,this movie was set mainly 10 years ago so perhaps Connor already has the prize because the first Highlander was set in the mid-eighties was it not?And if Kell kills Connor he would inherit the prize from  Connor in a quickening!Thats my way of justifying the story but I agree it is a confusing storyline to fit in with the others.This was another point about the film,old chistopher lambert could of done with dying his hair losing a few pounds to make him look the same as the other movies if he is immortal why does he look so old.The film despite the shoestring effects also and the lack of bigger sets etc I still like just for the action ,swordfights and seeing both mclouds together at last.It does seem a shame to kill off connor though(sorry to ruin it for anyone who has not seen it)The dvd itself is also hard to fault for fun,great 5.1 audio,great widescreen  transfer very clear and also good extras even a second rough cut of the film for real fanatics!Also good musical exciting menus and lots of trailers etc.Just forget the crazy storyline,turn up the volume and enjoy the swords clash and explode through your surround system!Very excited about forthcoming Highlander immortal edition dvd,and hope to see another action packed(bigger budget!)sequel featuring Duncan Mcloud soon.
B00005BCOL|5.0|I got interested in seeing this movie after reading about the authoress of the original play,Clare Booth-Luce I think.  I knew I was in for a good time when in the opening credits before they show the actress they would show a different cat.  This was the cattiest movie I have EVER seen.  It is fairly suprising when you take into account when the movie was made.  You really could not make this now, it would not come across right.  Buy this movie!  Rent this movie!  Just watch this movie,it is great!
0060278234|3.0|Nearly every work of Nix's I've laid eyes upon have never ceased to amaze; from Shades Children, to Sabriel.  Expectant, I read Lireal for the 'stunning' sequel to Sabirel...as I began reading, I was dissapointed with the unconventional and reluctant characters.  Of course, this is purely stylistic, and possibly the wiser decision.  Sam really bothered me, though...he never stood up to do what he had to do! Lirael is 'disturbed' by the Paper Wings, and always skipped the Fighting Arts classes.<br />Despite that, I forced myself to enjoy the book and fresh characters, even as I wished they would be as daring-do as the bold Sabriel.  Eventually I acknowledged that this was the author's way of mixing things up a bit, and Lireal could even be considered more realistic.  But then there is the case of the Direputable Dog - I didn't think she was nearly as interesting as the evil-yet-not-evil Moggett and his duel personalities.  The Disreputable Dog was a wonderfully drawn character, but didn't have the same sort of mysterious danger looming about Moggett that I enjoyed so much.<br />At last, there is the ending.  Ah, the ending.  I understand there is to be a sequel, which I will undoubtably read.  The cliffhanger ending was terribly distasteful, and I believe all books should stand on their own, regardless of what's to come next.  At least if the author wanted to tie everything together, rather than a 'monster-of-the-week' feel as many series tend to accomplish, than Nix might have at least answered the majority of questions.  After nearly 500 pages, I was dissapointed at how little was accomplished.<br />Don't get me wrong, it was alright and very well written.  But it just wasn't what I expected, and cliffhanger endings get on my nerves.  There were a few other snags and annoyances, and I think you should wait until Abhorsen is released.  Then you can read both in succession, and each, I trust, will flow nicely into the next.  I think you'll get a lot more out of it.
6303212379|5.0|I think that the Goonies is the best movie ever.  I can watch this movie a 100 times and never get tired of it.  I cant wait for the sequel to come out.  Treasure this movie, because there will never be another one like it- i promise you that
B00005LOUS|5.0|This is a good movie. I saw the cartoon original on television and I think that one was truer to the book. Jim Carrey has never been better cast since &quot;The Mask&quot;. It's long but it's good. I wouldn't mind moving to Whoville, is there really was such a place. Go see it! Don't wait 'til Christmas, just go!
B000002UAR|5.0|I love the Beatles. They are my all-time favorite band.<br />The thing about Revolver is, although most of the songs are great, some of them sound a little out of tune. This is what Paul McCartney said at first, after hearing the recording.<br />Also, some of the instrument sounds are somewhat harsh compared to some of their other albums.<br />I'm saying this partly because Revolver showed up as the #1 rock album of all time on an MTV program. I would say that it is a great album, but I believe that Sgt. Pepper is their best album.<br />So buy Revolver, but check out Sgt. Pepper too!
B000002A3T|2.0|This album is not worse than \\"Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" but it still isn't good.<BR>It's a really overproduced album with way too much synthesizer-atmospheric sounds and not the greatness of playing you know from the other Pink Floyd albums.<BR>Though there are some nice melodies, most of the songs have parts that remind me on older Pink Floyd songs.<BR>For example \\"Cluster One\\" sounds like an early 90's version of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and beginning of \\"What do you want from me\\" sounds like \\"Take A Cigar\\"<BR>When \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\" wouldn't sound that artificial, I would really like it, cause it has a really great melody.<BR>\\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" is a radio-song with long saxophone solo, that isn't played by one of the Floyd members, not worth listening to it.<BR>The only song that adds something to the Pink Floyd repertoire here is \\"High Hopes\\", that doesn't sound like any other Floyd song and is somehow dramatic and desparing.<br />But when you look at the whole CD, it's just a try to wake the old Pink Floyd times again, and also a try to make some more money ! SO, WELCOME TO THE MACHINE, PINK FLOYD !!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|After reading many of the reviews here, I wasn't sure how I would feel about this movie. Some people absolutely adored this production, and others were very critical of the casting and directing (and defended their points of view eloquently).<BR>I do agree that Anne in the novel was probably more assertive, among other things- but I thought Ms. Root's Anne was something very special. This is a wonderful adaptation, for it is subtle. You see, Anne had experienced true love, but because she was once young, and persuaded by a family friend to not lower herself socially, she lets love pass her by. Quite innocent and inexperienced, you can imagine Anne's inner struggle to chose between  her own impulses, which were considered improper, anyway, and her station in society. Wentworth, thus scorned, takes off and Anne is left to find a better match. She has had other suitors (Charles), but does not accept any proposals. Years have passed, and Anne is older, what was deemed a &quot;spinster&quot;. Ms. Root appears sad, sallow- her face appears to have been set in a frown for a very long time. One wonders how she was able to capture the hearts of men at all, but it is her kindness, her sensitivity and her intelligence that make her so precious. <BR>When she is sent to stay with her sister, there is some humor in how she is confided in by all the members of the Muskgrove family... When she meets Capt. Wentworth after so many years, you can see the emotion in her eyes, despite her demeanor. You can see her heartbreak when her sister Mary reports later on that Capt. Wentworth had found her so altered after all those years that he barely recognized her (ouch!). He is so perfectly indifferent at first that you just know he is punishing her for her past rejection (his rare, stolen glances are fabulous!). And she does not have the guile to see this- I remember almost crying when they all go off on their long walk, and she is ignored, bossed around, and forced to watch the Muskgrove girls cavort with the man she desperately still loved.<BR>I thought Ms. Root was exquisite- as her love is rekindled, the sallowness in her expression fades and is replaced by radiance and her eyes become luminous. Mr. Hinds is very dashing as Capt. Wentworth, with a face that is not necessarily &quot;good-looking&quot; in the traditional Hollywood leading man sort of way, but handsome in a masculine way.<BR>I was pleased with all the actors, and with how the story was portrayed. Austen wrote to a niece that Anne was almost &quot;too good&quot; for her, and this production allows you to see why- there is not the (wonderful and necessary!) outpour of emotion or the impatience of younger heroines such as Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice, or Marianne in Sense and Sensibility; Anne is older, more cautious. This is not the love affair of two first-time lovers. I appreciate the fact that, despite the improvement of her countenance toward the end, it is not Anne's beauty that wins hearts, but rather her mind and spirit.<BR>Perhaps I enjoyed this because I did not expect much, and was therefore pleasantly surprised. As already mentioned by fellow reviewers, this is not the BBC's P&amp;P or Lee's S&amp;S- but what it is, is something very rewarding in its own right.
B00005QDW1|1.0|well, it figures...the first song released off this album is that completely annoying anthem to moronic lyrics, \\"hey baby.\\"  i've been watching (listening at times) as a band that had such great messages like \\"just a girl\\" has just gone completely downhill.  i find it amusing to see members of this band drape themselves in t-shirts of bands like \\"madness\\" and \\"the specials (i think...)\\" as if this should immediately translate into some type of street cred and should minimalize the fact that their music just plain sucks.  ...
B00001NFCY|5.0|Here's to you who say Creed cashed in on the &quot;post-grunge nostalgia&quot;: when they released My Own Prison, grunge was as bankable as a wooden nickel.  That was who they were and how they wanted to be; how they put their emotions and their lives to music.<br />Here's to you who say their lyrics and music are formulaic: Stapp and Tremonti are constantly writing and making new music, Tremonti more than Stapp, but the music is constantly evolving.  You can't take Higher (albeit over-played on the radio in '99 and '00) and say it could fit anywhere with the My Own Prison album.  Creed moved on and it's faster-riffed, and completely uplifting.  You could compare Wash Away Those Years or Inside Us All with What's This Life For or One, but they are completely different if you look at the melodies or even the way the song is lyrically.<br />For those of you who say Creed ripped of Pearl Jam: where are you coming from?  Their voices are similar?!  The music sounds similar?!  Can you tell me bands that doesn't occur with?  Matchbox Twenty sounds a heck of a lot like the Goo Goo Dolls (the newer Dolls and the older MB20), and Hoobastank is exactly like their close friends, Incubus.  The only reason this is even an issue is because of the PJ/Creed debates and because Pearl Jam is slowly fading out of the limelight, while Creed continues to shine.<br />And for those of you who don't care, and just want to enjoy good, melodic rock: Pick this CD up.  Ignore the hype, or the rest of the media attention, even the fact this record sold over 10 million copies, and, as I said of Weathered, JUST LISTEN.
0783225725|5.0|Clint Eastwood revisits the genre that made him a star in High Plains Drifter, and as in most of his previous westerns he plays a mysterious, nameless stranger.<br />What's immediately interesting about this particular take on the character is his apparent amorality. Before the first act closes he kills three men and rapes a woman - all done with a disturbingly casual intensity. Not exactly the kind of guy you want to find yourself rooting for.<br />The film unfolds wonderfully, moving effortlessly between dark drama and self-conscious satire of western film conventions. The action is periodically interspersed with some very creepy fever dreams...

B00005QIPH|4.0|Don't let their failure to match the hype scare you away...  If you listen to this album to enjoy some light rock with a catchy beat you will be pleasantly surprised.  Tunes like Modern Age, Someday and Last Night, complete with Tom Petty's American Girl riffs, are songs you'll have a tough time getting out of your head.  Don't set the bar too high and you'll be glad you bought this CD.  I nevered listened to the Velvet Underground and I think that has helped me accept this band and their music for what they are.
B00005JKT8|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to watch 'Kate and Leopold' but once I started it was really enjoyable and I couldn't stop!  My reluctance stemmed of course, from the plot ie time travel, which is certainly not new to movies.  <br />The movie is extremely refeshing (no bad language, nudity, sex) and Hugh Jackman is a very talented actor.  It was clever of Mangold not to focus on the time travel aspect but on Kate's developing relationship with Leopold.  My favourite part is definately when Leopold stands up as Kate is leaving the table, and she says almost angrily, 'what's with the standing??\\"<br />This really shows us how much things have changed!!
B00003CXE7|4.0|I wanted to see Russell Crowe in his other movies after seeing him doing such an AMAZING job in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".  Joaquin Phoenix did a AWESOME job as a manipulative, deceiving, sickening jerk. The special effects and the sets was pretty amazing too.<br />Russell Crowe did a good job too. The scene where he found his son and wife crucified and burnt just broke my heart. It seemed to me that the character of \\"Maximus\\" was stoic(sp?) most of the time. The only thing that disappointed me was the ending. I could've lived without the ending. It was also difficult to find a plot. I'm NOT bashing the movie at all!!! Like I said, I think I need to watch it more than once. The more I watch it, the more I like it.<br />The DVD features are cool. I like to watch the montage of unused scenes with the beautiful music playing in the background and the \\"Making of\\" featurette.<br />Speaking of the music, the music in this movie is so beautiful and haunting.<br />Overall, it's entertaining. I DO recommend it!!
0618077367|5.0|This book is fantastic, this book is one of my only favorites.Its a very good gift for children around christmas. I feel in love with this book when i first read it in kindergarden. My homeboy Chris thinks im childish and shouldnt be interested about this book at all. Nobody is never too old to be reading The Polar Express...
B00005TT77|3.0|What makes a good cover song? The song has to give a version of an old song with the new artists influences into it yet it cant wander to far away from the original artists main purposes. On the soundtrack \\"I Am Sam\\" the listener hears examples of both mistakes but they also hear a group of good songs.<BR>   While none of the songs on the cd are better than the original there are quite a few good songs on the disc. The cd starts Aimee Mann's and Micheal Penn's beautiful version of \\"Two of Us.\\" Ben Harper adds his unique voice to \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and newcomer Howie Day gives a great version of \\"Help.\\" Other highlights of this cd are Wainwright's \\"Across the Universe,\\" Wallflowers \\"Im Looking Through You,\\" Vedders \\"Hide Your Love Away,\\" Crow's \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" and Folds' \\"Golden Slumbers.\\"<BR>   McClachlan's \\"Blackbird\\" sounds just like McCartny's song if the Beatle sang high pitched. My biggest disappointment was with Chocalate Genius' \\"Julia\\" which sounded nothing like Lennon's original. Another disappointment was the Black Crowes version of \\"Lucy in the Sky\\"<BR>   Like most soundtracks, I Am Sam suffers from  a problem. The good songs are really good but the bad songs bring them down. While some of these problems might have been erased by having an album full of covers all it did was higher expectations of Beatles fans. Nonetheless, if you are a Beatle fan you will enjoy some songs on this album despite some dissapointments.
0553573403|2.0|[....]I enjoy fantasy and sci-fi writing a lot.  Usually I can force my way through a fantasy/sci-fi book even if it's pretty bad.  Heck, I finished Crichton's Airframe.  However, there was just a certain impenetrable thickness to this book that only let me get about 100 pages in, both times I tried.  I think a book should leave you wondering what happens next when you have to put it down to go to class or something like that.  However, this book was so confusing that I found myself avoiding it whenever I had time to read.  Don't get me wrong, I love stories of intrigue and mystery, and stuff that messes with your head, but this was different.  It was just plain confusing; I think part of that is due to the fact that so many of the names Martin uses sound extremely similar so I never knew who's who.  Not as in I never knew who was on whose side in a mysterious intriguing sort of way, but that I never could get the name with the right person.  Maybe he should have gone more in-depth with each character, and maybe stretched it out to a five-book series.  The story did not seem to be in any way lacking; it just wasn't written as well as it could have been.  Oh, and what's with the graphic sexual stuff?  seriously, I think we're all mature enough to know that it goes on and don't need to be reading about \\"the wetness between her thighs.\\"<br />Anyway, try this book out for yourself; you may be able to get into it better than I did, and it may have some good things to offer as well.
0380796090|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book which was my first introduction to Marian Keyes writing.  I was reading it in a small book club but could not stop and wait for the others before finishing it.  She has a refreshing style and I could not put Watermelon down!  I can't wait to dive into the next Marian Keyes book!
B00001U0DP|5.0|I noticed that some people were confused with events that occured during the film.  After living in Naples, Italy for 2 years, all of these events were perfectly normal to me.  Of course, most American's will not understand every part of this film.  But on the other hand, this movie was not made for an American audience.  So before you criticize this film, think about the differences between the Italian culture and our own.

B00005RFVL|5.0|I'm pretty selective about the reviews I write - so you can be sure that when I do write one, it's worth it.  Swing while you're winning is a musical dream come true.  Not only do you have the styling of Robbie William's fantastic voice, but the hot sounds of the London Session Orchestra that takes us back to the era of Frank, Dean, and Sammy (to whom this album is dedicated).  And there are some imaginative and near perfect duets on this album too.  Nicole Kidman, Jane Horrocks (of Ab Fab's &quot;Bubbles&quot; and &quot;Little Voice&quot; fame), Rupert Everett, Jon Lovitz, and even the late Mr. Sinatra.  But the &quot;winning&quot; doesn't end there.  The tempos, the styles, and the overall sound with which each song is performed allows you to see the versatility of this music and sound, not to mention the versatility of music as a whole.  Can a Brit meet, step up to the bar, sing along, and sip dry martini's with the Rat Pack?  Bartender, another round!!
0451527712|4.0|A Flash of lightning strikes, thunder crashes rumbling the whole house and suddenly...  Wait a minute!  This is not the book I read.  The image that our society has of Frankenstein is extremely twisted from Mary Shelley's original.  I am not exactly sure if the ugly, horror image was the one that Shelley was attempting to achieve.  However, she ended up creating a novel that dealt more with an individual struggle rather than a horror story.  Victor Frankenstein, who is not the creature, but the creator, provides readers with many interesting perspectives about his thinking and motives.  Mary Shelley has written an excellent novel for readers who want to analyze her work using various critical methods.<br />  I believe she has also written an excellent novel for readers who can stand an extremely slow pace.  The story began and I felt like I was never going to reach the heart of the novel.  However, once the reader moves through the introduction, Shelley does not stop giving you creative images and adventure.  Overall, I believe the novel was a descent story for the basic, surface reader.  In addition, I think that the psychoanalytic critics could have a field day with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
B00005JKQX|4.0|It's difficult to separate the fact from the fiction in watching this film; however, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, as directed by Ron Howard, is a compelling study of a brilliant mind gone somewhat astray. I agree that the movie is presented in a slick fashion, but I do think that it did its job in presenting us with the Cliff's Notes version of the fascinating story of John Forbes Nash, Jr.--enough to make me want to learn more about the life of this remarkable but troubled man.<br />A BEAUTIFUL MIND opens at Princeton University in 1947, as John Nash (in a subtle and layered performance by the brilliant Australian actor Russell Crowe) and several of his contemporaries enter the doctoral program there. There is a great whiff of rivalry that permeates the air; although he is admired by his fellow students, John Nash feels threatened by them. This causes him to be quite off-putting at times. Unlike the others, he never goes to classes, which he feels are \\"a great waste\\" of his time. We see him writing formulas on his dormitory windows in search of a grand unified theory of...something. Even at this early stage, we can definitely see that there is something amiss about his personality. But there is more, much more, in store for this beautiful mind, as it descends slowly over the years into the realm of schizophrenia.<br />Russell Crowe plays this role with as much love for Nash's flaws as well as his brilliance. His is the best portrayal of mental illness since that of Geoffrey Rush in SHINE (1997). Rush deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance; Crowe stands a good chance of doing the same this year. The vastly underrated Jennifer Connelly plays the role of John's paramour and wife Alicia, wo gradually uncovers John's web of delusion and decides to not be a passive bystander to it all. She is being deservedly nominated for Best Supporting Actress.<br />All in all, A BEAUTIFUL MIND is compelling, well-written, somewhat entertaining, and extremely well-acted. However, it must be noted that this is but a surface character study of a complex and troubled individual. There is much more to learn about John Forbes Nash, Jr. Taken on its own, this is a film that is well-worth watching. I, for one, cannot wait for it to be released on DVD, where hopefully there will be a lot of extra scenes that were deleted from the initial release--this may help us grasp the character better. Then again, a trip to the local public library may be the better option.  You decide for yourself.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|This movie does what movies are more or less made to do, entertain.  It has fairly good acting, and is decently written.  The special effects are excellent, as is the sound(which won an oscar).  It's pretty fun to watch, and is worth renting from your local blockbuster, and the extras on the DVD are interesting and there are lots of them.  <br />If your looking for any history though, this isn't the movie for you.  After reading some of the one and two star reviews, I realized that the limeys get upset when they don't get there due credit for what they did in WWII.  And in this case I agree.  There was no mention of what the British had done earlier in the war to get the enigma machine.  Not even a mention of them early in the movie when the officers are getting briefed on the situation.  (That would have been enough to silence the British resentment and then the movie would only have to get bad reviews from Americans who think that movies need to be historically accurate 100% of the time)<br />In all, this movie is a visual feast, and lots of fun on a slow weeknight.  But it's forgettable and doesn't have the affect of Saving Private Ryan.
078324228X|5.0|i watch the hurricane last night thinking that it was going to be another boring prison film, but it was like the film touched me in a way. it was a story about a man who believe in things so much that nothing was going to change it and for that i think Rubin deserves some repect. Denzel Washington played the part perfectly and they even looked alike which makes it more believable. after watching the film and never even hearing of Rubin Carter i am now purchasing the book it see how it must of really felt for him. i guess after hearing such a powerfull story like that u wonder how messed up the world really is and that law isnt always right.
B00005QIPH|1.0|This album is a collection of mediocre songs played poorly. But then I saw the video, and aside from his super-hip hyper-cool attitude, what got me was the singer's plastic over-18 bar bracelets. That's dripping with cool, to be sure.

B000002G0P|5.0|Truly, III Sides To Every Story, by Extreme, is musically unique in it's own right. <BR>--<BR>This Concept CD, is divided into three fascinating worlds of music. YOURS, which is all rock 'n' roll, the YOURS side is highly intelligent musically with it's direction. It deals with issues of war, as \\"Warheads\\" states -- \\"this world ain't big enough for two, and I've got my sights on you\\". \\"Warheads\\" is a tone setter for the next five tracks to come. Instantly noticeable on \\"Warheads\\" is Nuno Bettencourt's highly skilled guitar playing and smooth backround vocals. <BR>--<BR>Gary Cherone instantly lets us know that he is the vocal narrator here on III Sides, as he sings with mesmerizing passion, strength and fire. The next issue addressed here on III Sides is peace and if we really mean it from our hearts. <BR>--<BR>\\"Rest In Peace\\" is one powerhouse of a song, from the opening violin segment, to Nuno's nuclear fall out guitar sound, to Gary Cherone's powerful and whimsical vocals. \\"Rest In Peace\\" is an intellectually stimulating song, and serves as a notice to us all to be serious about peace or don't say anything at all. I could see why \\"Rest In Peace\\" was a big hit, killer grooves, excellent musicianship, just downright brilliant. Political disaster is the next issue addressed in \\"Politicalamity\\", which features the funky metal horns featured on Extreme's Pornograffitti. This highly crafted song features the trademark Extreme style, only elevated to the next level. Funk metal at it's artfully skilled best. Racisim is the subject of \\"Color Me Blind\\" which makes us realize that if the world had no color we wouldn't be any different, just a people more or less, how true since it's only skin pigment. From the opening with Extreme's excellent vocals, to the thought provoking lyrics and Gary Cherone's showmanship, this song serves us another amazing track on III Sides. The guitar work by Nuno displayed here is funky and downright full of life. The whole track features a hardin your face rock feel. Murder and the news media I'd say is the subject of \\"Cupids Dead\\", and this song just downright rocks our world. Funky and groove laden, \\"Cupids Dead\\" with Gary Cherone's rap/pop singing style remains a true rock 'n' roll masterpiece. We are served up with intelligent rock and rap, and a bonus long solo with Nuno and Pat Badger throwing fire with their guitar and bass duet. Amazing. It get's even better with \\"Peacemaker Die\\" where Gary Cherone plays devils advocate, playing all evil in attempt to kill anybody who believes in peace between all people. Martin Luther King is the peacemaker here, and while it may seem offensive the song sympathizes with how wrong all the evil is. There is no point to it. Nuno's guitar playing is complex and unbelievable on \\"Peacemaker Die\\". His guitar solo, the bands musicianship, and Gary's vocal chops, which takes the track into the famous Martin Luther King speech, clearly places this song into supremacy. The next two sides, MINE, and THE TRUTH, with some of the highlights being, \\"Am I Ever Gonna Change\\", \\"Rise 'n' Shine\\", \\"Who Cares\\", \\"Stop The World\\", \\"God Isn't Dead\\", \\"Our Father\\" take the rest of the CD into another world and establish without question a progressive rock kind of feel. This is one of the best CD's ever made and is an essential CD to have in your own personal collection. It's also proof that the music industry sometimes lies on deaf ears as this is one of the most underrated, highly skilled, album or CD to ever have been released.<BR>--<BR>The Cherone/Bettencourt relationship is a very interesting one, as they totally are musical masterminds when they work together. You must own this CD!
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger Water's opens \\"Amused To Death\\" by the spoken words of Alf Razzell, recorded during a recent telecision interview about his unenviable assignment of obtaining identification from the battlefield dead during WWII:<br />[Alf Razzell:] \\"Two things that have haunted me most are the days when I had to collect the paybooks; and when I left Bill Hubbard in no-man's-land. I was picked up and taken into their trench. And I'd no sooner taken two or three steps down the trench when I heard, \\"Ho Hello Razz, I'm glad to see you! This is my second night here,\\", he said \\"I'm feeling bad.\\" And it was Bill Hubbard, one of the men we'd trained in England, one of the original battalion. I had a look at his wound; rolled him over and I could see it was probably a fatal wound. You could imagine what pain he was in, he was dripping with sweat; and after I'd gone about three shellholes, traversed that, had it been...had there been a path or a road I could have done better. He pummelled me, 'Put me down, put me down, I'd rather die, I'd rather die, put me down.' I was hoping he would faint. He said 'I can't go any further, let me die.' I said 'If I leave you here Bill you won't be found, let's have another go.' He said 'All right then.' And the same thing happened. he couldn't stand it any more, and I had to leave him there, in no-man's-land.\\"<br />and this is how Roger Waters closes the CD:<br />[Alf Razzell:] \\"Years later, I saw Bill Hubbard's name on the memorial to the missing at Aras. And I...when I saw his name I was absolutely transfixed; it was as though he...he was now a human being instead of some sort of nightmarish memory of how I had to leave him, all those years ago. And I felt relieved, and ever since then I've felt happier about it, because always before, whenever I thought of him, I said to myself, 'Was there something else that I could have done?' [background: \\"I'd rather die, I'd rather die...\\"] And that always sort of worried me. And having seen him, and his namein the register - as you know in the memorials there's a little safe, there's a register in there with every name - and seeing his name and his name on the memorial; it sort of lightened my...heart, if you like.\\"<BR>[woman:] \\"When was it that you saw his name on the memorial?\\"<BR>[Alf:] \\"Ah, when I was eighty-seven, that would be the year, ninete...eighty-four, nineteen eighty-four.\\" <br />Not cheerful, not happy but incredibly powerful the same way that \\"The Final Cut\\" is.  If you want a nice mindless romp, look under 'Brittney Spears'.  If you desire a powerful, intelligent statement from a man who lost his father to the trenches of WWII, you have found it.

B00004YA0T|5.0|This set is a wonderful bargain, preserving the second of Jochum's integral recordings of the Bruckner symphonies. On Lp these performances, recorded in Dresden's Lukaskirche in the 1970s, sounded a little diffuse when compared with the Bruckner Jochum recorded for DGG in the '50s and '60s. Digital remastering has brought admirable focus to the EMI analog masters and these recordings now sound as good or better than their DGG counterparts. The performances are quite similar, except that the Dresden Staatskapelle plays with a warmth and tonal lustre that is superior to the Berlin and Munich orchestras featured in the DGG set.<br /><br />In all cases, Jochum is the conductor for those people who enjoy the Schubert in Bruckner: melody is highlighted throughout and melodic lines are flexibly projected with an inerrant sense of how they should relate to the structural argument. Some might find that Jochum's lyrical approach scants the rigors of Bruckner's architecture, that it's too \\"soft.\\" They should seek out Klemperer and others. But for most people, Jochum is one of the three or four greatest Bruckner conductors ever and his recordings are, if not the last word on Bruckner interpretation, \\"must buys.\\"<br /><br />Three things to note. First, throughout his career, Jochum only played the canonical Bruckner symphonies, 1 thru 9; you won't find symphonies \\"0\\" and \\"00\\" in this set. Second, Bruckner exists in different peforming editions, the most famous being those prepared by scholars Robert Haas (in the 1930s and '40s) and Leopold Nowak (in the 1950s). I should point out that Jochum consistently favored the Nowak editions. (Except in the case of the Eighth Symphony, the differences between Haas and Nowak aren't really important except to scholars. But Amazon's description of this set claims that Jochum used the now-discredited Schalk editions. Not true!) Third, setting aside whose edition you play, Bruckner himself prepared various versions of many of his symphonies and these differences matter. Mostly, Jochum plays the Bruckner versions that have come to be regarded as standard. But, in the case of the Third Symphony, Jochum, like most conductors of the old school, plays Bruckner's 1889 (third and final) version. Most conductors today favor Bruckner's second version from 1876-1877. (On Naxos, Bruckner maverick Georg Tintner prefers Bruckner's even more expansive first version from 1873. See my review of the Naxos 'White Box' collection of all Tintner's Bruckner performances here [[ASIN:B000S57E3I Bruckner: The Complete Symphonies]]). The 1889 version is the one I grew up with and Jochum's performance is superb; but, like many people, I have come to prefer the more expansively argued 1876/1877 version.<br /><br />OK, back to the set. Sound quality is fine throughout, and the price is fantastic. And about the packaging. Bravo, EMI, for ending the lunacy of gigantic boxes of jewel trays that look ugly and take up half a foot or more on your shelf! This soft box format is slim and elegant. The individual CDs are held safe and snug in rigid cardboard envelopes, and the box itself is nice to look at and plenty sturdy. In other words, unless you use your CD boxes as hockey pucks, I don't see any reason to believe that the packaging won't last longer than you do.

6303589103|3.0|The 1980's were an era that mass produced more... screwball comedies than ever before. It was also the era that movies filled with mega-violence were made and cloned more quickly than mulitpling mosquitoes.[I thought] one of these such films was BLUE THUNDER.<br /><br />BLUE THUNDER has all the elements of many of those violent 1980s films. The lead character is a Vietnam vet struggling with vivid flashbacks. He has a comical sidekick (in this case played by Daniel Sterns) who is murdered about halfway through the picture. The lead character ends up getting caught up in a plot that runs deeper than he originally imagined that ends up leading all the way to some secret government sector or plot. In the end the hero takes things into his own hands and goes on a rampage to get the bad guys and set things right and is cleared of all wrong doing, accused or actual.<br /><br />Roy Scheider stars in the film as L.A.P.D. aero-division pilot Frank Murphy. Schneider does a decent job considered the material he was given. Besides one feels an immediate kinship to anything Scheider acts in; this is the guy that killed Jaws. His sidekick in the film is a young Daniel Sterns (before he gained fame with \\"The Wonder Years\\" and HOME ALONE) and he does a good job playing the greenhorn.<br /><br />However, neither Scheider or Sterns is the star of this movie. They are both second billing to a super-duper armed police helicopter called (you guessed it), BLUE THUNDER. You see Blue Thunder was created by the government to keep us rebellious citizens in line and to protect people at the 1984 Olympic Games in L.A. However, some really evil guys planned to use the machine for alternative purposes to help \\"keep order\\" (hint, hint). This chopter has armor, can sense heat, shoots a lot of bullets really fast, and can hear and see through walls. She's the star.<br /><br />Overall, the movie's not all that good or bad. The movie starts off slow but picks up after the first half hour racing steam until the exploding, yet let down of a conclusion.until the exploding, yet let down of a conclusion.
0790749998|5.0|This refers to the VHS version. I first rented this movie to see what kind of an actress Aaliyah was. My comments... she pretty much nailed her part, so effortlessly you'd think she didn't even need to memorize a script. That's how great she was. We all still miss her... <BR>I had seen Jet Li in Lethal Weapon 4 and was very impressed with his martial art techniques. I thought I'd rent \\"Romeo Must Die\\" to see how well of an actor he is, because in LW4 he doesn't really talk much. Turns out he's an excellent actor as well. The movie has a tinge of Shakespeare's famous play \\"Romeo & Juliet\\", two families fighting over property and higher status with Li and Aaliyah trying to bring peace to the out of control families. Thankfully, and unlike the tragedy itself, the heroes (Li and Aaliyah) DO NOT kill themselves at the end! There are some really intense fight sequences, especially the one at the end with Han (Li) versus Kai (Russell Wong). Some great effects going on in this movie, but like all my reviews, I'm not giving away all of the movie. This is a must see for anyone, but I don't recommend it for children under 13 because of lots of violence and language. Happy viewing everyone!

B00003CXXS|4.0|After being somewhat disappointed with the \\"The Lost World\\" I was a bit weary of a second sequel to the mega hit, \\"Jurassic Park\\".  However, I was pleasantly surprised and liked this one a great deal.  The new director, Joe Johnston, makes the movie an enjoyable thrill ride, much like the first in the series, with action from start to finish.  And, because they are the REAL stars of the movie, we are introduced to a new dinosaur, even more terrifying than the towering T-Rex.  The Spinosaurus is an incredible new edition to the menagerie of dinosaurs that we've come to expect in these movies.  This is a good dvd and a nice companion to the other two.  I recommend it as a really good adventure film.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I feel compelled to give my 2 cents.  Years ago when it came out many of my friends and co-workers were listening to it, and invariably were saying to me &quot;Isn't it exciting what these guys are doing?&quot; and the like.  So for some reason I avoided it, figuring I was too late to the party.  If you're reading this plethora of reviews you may think you're late to the party as well.  WHO CARES!<br />This entire CD has been in my head since I got it 2 weeks ago, and I think I've only digested about 30% of it.  I look forward to getting in the car in the morning so I can digest more.  Best album ever?  That's a strong statement but I'm atleast starting to see where these people are coming from.  Though I haven't done it yet, I can tell this is one of those rare albums best enjoyed when you can play it, sit down and relax, and LISTEN.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005QZWI|5.0|All the compositions on this soundtrack have obviously been thought over very carefully, and the moods of the pieces are easily identified. The elements of the songs are reflected in the film, escpecially The Council Of Elrond and The Breaking Of The Fellowship. The pieces are very sentimental and really make the listener stop and hear the music.
0345440900|5.0|As first time parents, my wife and I were both frustrated and overwhelmed by the conflicting advice that we received even before our daughter was released from the hospital.  <br />In between the feedings and diaper changes during the first few days at home, I read Secrets of the Baby Whisperer, which was given to us by a family friend.  Finally, there was a sane voice of experience that helped us to find our own way.<br />Some of the important points of this book:<br />1.  It is normal to feel overwhelmed.  <BR> <BR>2.  Every baby has a unique personality.  While Tracy Hogg's categories may be somewhat oversimplified, she does offer a means of identifying your baby's personality so that you may better handle certain situations.  No single approach will work with every baby, because they are all different.<br />3.  You are not evil if you choose not to breast feed.  This seems to be the subject of most of the negative reviews on this site, which is unfortunate.  However, the author does not advocate either breast or formula feeding, she merely presents the pros and cons of each in a balanced manner, and provides reassurance that whatever method you choose, it is your choice to make, and there is no wrong decision.  <br />4.  One of the best pieces of advice:  follow a structured routine.  \\"EASY\\":  Eat, Activity, Sleep, time for Yourself.  This is another area that seems to have drawn criticism from fellow ... reviewers.    \\"EASY\\" is presented as an alternative to feeding on demand and scheduled feeding.  Actually, it is not as much an alternative as it is a combination of the two.  <BR>--> Following a set schedule is often impractical, as we found out ourselves while our daughter was still in the hospital.  There, feeding took place every three hours, and at the same times.  Most of the feedings went well, but at times, it seemed as though we were were force-feeding the poor kid, and it was implied that we were somehow bad parents if she did not finish the prescribed amount.  Once we got home, we were able to be more flexible with the feeding times, which is exactly what EASY suggests.<BR>-->  What EASY suggests is following a prescribed routine.  Eating is followed by activity, and the activity is followed by sleep.  And while the baby sleeps, you have time for yourself.  The structure is etched in stone, but the times are not.  Who will not agree that flexibility is good?  And having the structure will help you interpret your baby's cries and decrease the miscues (for example, trying to feed the baby when the baby is actually overstimulated, or over-tired).<br />5.  The author provides guidelines for interpreting your baby's crying.<br />6.  The author also explains how bad habits start and suggests methods for undoing bad habits.  For example:  allowing the baby to fall asleep on your chest may lead to the baby needing your chest to fall asleep.... <br />7.  Babies need to become independent.  This means not rushing to the crib everytime they start to fuss.  Babies need to learn to self-soothe and often will go back to sleep.<br />As with any book of this type, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer is not perfect, and there is some content that I do not necessarily agree with.  But that's okay.  The author is writing from personal experience, of which she has a lot.  You will not find a whole lot of her advice to be in the vein of \\"studies have shown...\\" but rather \\"what I have learned....\\"  <br />The style in which the book is written is also refreshingly down-to-earth.  She speaks to the reader in a friendly voice that is neither condescending nor inaccessible.  <br />Is this book worthy of addition to your bookshelf?  Absolutely.  I highly recommend it.  Read it once, and you'll refer to it again and again. <br />The best advice that I can personally give anyone who is a new parent is this:  TRUST YOUR OWN INSTINCTS.  You will hear and read a lot of conflicting advice, none of which is perfect.  You will have to find out what works best for you and your baby.  No book can do that for you.  Where Secrets of the Baby Whisperer succeeded the most for me was giving me the level of confidence to trust my own instincts, while providing some useful guidelines and advice.
1573225517|4.0|We're a group of twelve ESL students who read &quot;HiFi&quot; as a class assignment. Although the novel is a light read, it deals with serious problems facing many young (and not so young) people: finding their way of life concerning relationships and career decisions. What we liked best about the novel were Rob's interesting though often bizarre observations about life in general, the witty dialogues interspersed with slang and profanities, and the surprising turning points and sub-plots. Still, we found that Laura's and Rob's  relationship was depicted quite superficially. Also, due to lack of cultural background, many jokes on pop music and movies were wasted on us. All in all, quite refreshing for a book read at school.
1587990717|3.0|Upon seeing an ad for this book in The Economist, I immediately bought this book.  Unfortunately, while the book is highly readable and interesting, I felt that Taleb only touched on half of the equation.  He spends the entire book highlighting the fact that most people cannot accurately understand probabilities and randomness.  However, he does not get shift into prescriptive mode at all aside from highlighting the fact that he has built his living on buying options in anticipation of unforeseen events.  I read the whole book hoping for a punch line, but it never comes.  Three stars for making me think, but I believe he did not cover this topic sufficiently to satisfy my initial enthusiasm for the book's topic.
031219126X|4.0|Frankenstein is a book for all ages.  Frankenstein has shown versatility throughout its life.  This book has been adapted by its readers to represent all eras.  It offers the reader a look not only into the past but also to the near future.  With such things as the Human Gnome project in mid-flourish Frankenstein has yet again opened the eyes of its readers.  The horror is not in the story but is in the representation it presents to us today.  Technology, science, love, and when you throw in the ambition of \\"Victor\\" you can closely relate to this tale.  Mary Schelley may have never intended for Frankenstein to be a book into the subconscious, or a representation of Marxist ideologies and various other criticism, but it has lend itself to be a perfect subject for study.  Frankenstein is truly a book worthy of reading by the most critical of readers.
B00003CY6M|5.0|This movie is very touchy. It is funny, romantic and perfect to watch if you have a date.<BR>Although everyone who is watching this movie ubderstands that what's happening over there is impossible, still it is very nice. It's a movie after all and it is created to let the person who is watching it forget about the normal world in which we live and to experience the whole new life where everyone lives a happy ever after.<BR>This movie is about Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) which meets a guy called Johnathan (John Cusack) while they are doind their Christmas shopping. They spend some time together but the lady believes in destiny and accidents and everything, so she decides to leave and if they ever meet again, that means they are meant to be together. The same day, they meet each other in the cafe because both of them forgot their stuff there. They spend a wonderful time together, when she writed her name and her # on the paper, it flies away, so she thinks they are not meant to be together.He writes his name and # on the 5 dollar with which she buys some stuff and she writes her name and # in the book which she's gonna sell the next day.<BR>After a few years, Sara moves to San Francisco, she's planning to get married but before the marriage she wants to take a short vacation to New York.<BR>Johnathan is planning to get married as well, although they never stop thinking about each other.<BR>After some troubles, they finally meet each other. Yipee!!!!!!!
0671721720|1.0|This book, like the first, is a gross display of self-indulgence by the author.  His desire for a dominatrix does not make good reading for the rest of us.  His untouchable perfect beauty fixation is quite disturbing.  This book is certainly science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction.  The author watched much too much Star Trek; page after page is dedicated tolaborious descriptions of the spaceship's mechanical workings.  The problem is that these descriptions are merely techno-babble with no science whatsoever.  I regret Amazon's grading system does not allow a zero star score.
B000002L9O|3.0|This is a decent enough Ramones album. There are stand-out tracks like Somebody Put Something In My Drink, Bonzo Goes To Bitburg, and the extra punky Animal Boy, but the consistency just isn't there. If you don't have the recently remastered Ramones, Leave Home, and Rocket To Russia with the bonus tracks, get them. The early It's Alive is also great, and Loco Live is a very good set which includes some of the better later tracks.
B000021Y7X|4.0|you don't have to be a fan of the talking heads to be captivated by this video. I first saw this because I couldn't find anything else interesting to rent at the video store and didn't know much about the group, and I was glued to my seat. If you are a fan you'd probably give it 5 stars.
B00003CXN4|2.0|Please people, get over this movie.  Just because the director uses a &quot;neat&quot; tint to the film and runs around with a hand cam does NOT a great picture make.  Think of Godfather III, looked like a Godfather film, smelled like a Godfather film, but it was terrible.  Don't be tricked into this ridiculously average film.  I'll give you the fact that Benicio does his best to save this picuture (he is always great), but it's more than even he could overcome.  First of all, some spoiled rich kid would not go to the &quot;hood&quot; to buy dope.  They'd have some guy like James Spader's character in Less Than Zero to buy from.  Also please explain how Ms Zeta-Jones goes from a naive tennis club wife to Don Corleone in a span of 2 minutes? Lastly, the speech between Michael Douglas and his daughters friend in the car almost tossed my red vines.  Possibly the most overrated film of the last 10 years.
B00005A1PR|5.0|no joke! India Arie is a rarity in this music world!  Im really feelin her positive and inspirational vibes.  My favorite and obviously in my opinion the heart and soul of the cd is &quot;Strength, Courage, &amp; Wisdom.&quot;  That doesnt mean the rest of the tracks arent as good, every single one believe it or not is REALLY GOOD! I love this cd because its a nice alternative to the self degrading lyrics in today's music.  I cant wait to see whats coming next from this talented artist.
B00001ODHF|5.0|Army of darkness is an intentionally  funny horror movie. The movie is part of the great evil dead trillogy about our hero bruce campell is sent back to miedevil europe. I saw it recentely because one of my friends owns the movie and I have to say that I became a big fun of hte trilogy because of this movie.
B000002KIE|5.0|How can you possibly give this influential punk classic anything less than 5 stars?  Here's another one of my top ten albums of the last 25 years.  Steve Jones' monster wall of guitars and Johnny Rotten's snarling, distinctive vocals and lyrics capture the unique musical and cultural climate of the late 70's.  Listen to this and then add to the experience by reading Jon Savage's England's Dreaming, a detailed account of The Sex Pistol's and the rest of British Punk's early glory.  Then check out the recent documentary The Filth and The Fury, and while you're at it, try to view the flawed, but captivating Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle on VHS.  That's rock and roll!
B00003CXXP|1.0|If this movie would have ended after just hours, it would have only been awful. However it kept going (and going) and turned into a complete piece of cinematic dung. I forget at exactly what point in the movie I ceased to just be upset and turned suicidal.
6305165912|1.0|Let me start by saying,this is by far the greatest movie ever made! I could relate to the story with it's gripping performances by the lead characters,mainly Scooter Numnum and Foothole Bingoneck! And let's not forget Buttmunch the 2nd!!!!!!!! What a character,going around pretending to be so intelligent,insulting people far more wise than himself just because they like something to deep for his feeble mind to fathom. He was trueeoollyyy pathetic!(Proper spelling \\"truly\\") He was like,if you like something I don't,you are dumb. And if you dislike something I \\"love\\",you are dumb. I guess that 3rd grade education really paid off. Hopefully those 101 working braincells will get behind a type WRITER(one T only please) and write us a brilliant screenplay one day.Yeah right! But enough about him,his part in the movie didn't really add up to anything other than a few laughs at his own expense. Scooter and Foothole are the real stars of this little gem. The way they shared the screen together was wonderful. If only all acting were this good. I laughed until my side hurt! Then I laughed some more. That's how funny this movie is. The only part I didn't get was when that kid wrote in crayon on the wall \\"TBWP\\". What was up with that? Oh well,it was funny to me all the same. I hope there is a sequel!
B000003TA4|5.0|Although it is considered the most mainstream of nirvana albums it is still very good.  As much as many people think Smells Like Teen Spirit is the best Nirvana song on the album there are other excelt songs on it too.  In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, Polly, Lounge Act, On A Plain; these are all excelent songs.  I would reccomend this album to people who mostly know the songs on the radio that Nirvana wrote.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Nicks weaves words with surreal sounds and when she sings, the result is seductive witchy tones with a touch of enchantment. I adore the way Stevie tells stories through her songs and half the pleasure is trying to decipher the poetic nature of the lyrics.<br /><br />The first song is intoxicating. Shangri-La is another word for an imaginary paradise on earth or an exotic utopia, perhaps a hideaway of idyllic beauty and tranquility. The fact that there is \\"trouble\\" in \\"paradise\\" seems significant especially when you consider what \\"dawn of separation\\" means. Some of the songs seem to be about romantic relationships and what you can learn from conflict or emotional pain.<br /><br />Candle bright seems to speak of a light that guides your soul back to a person who is provides stability in your life, even though you might be a dreamer. \\"You're my candlebright in the window.\\"<br /><br />Planets of the Universe<br /><br />The earth and the sea and the sky<br />Is at rest with the ocean<br />And the days go by<br />They go into the seas that have no shores<br />Haunted by that same closed door<br />Looking up at skies on fire<br />Leaving nothing left of us<br />To discover<br /><br />I also loved \\"I Miss You, Bombay Sapphires, Fall from Grace and Love is.\\" If you love Stevie's sultry voice, you are going to just adore these hypnotic songs. Each song has a unique twist, but all speak to the heart.<br /><br />\\"Do I know that you love me now?<br />Yes, I do.\\" -Love Is<br /><br />Audible Paradise.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B00002DESX|5.0|This is one of the top ten rock albums of the last 25 years.  It's a raw, influential masterpiece.  This is the punk rock that started it all.  Make sure you get the recently remastered version with the bonus tracks.  Then do the same with Ramones Leave Home, and Rocket To Russia.  After that, you're on your own.
B000007492|5.0|ONE of my favorite musical groups during the mid 70's through<br />the early 80's and (pickering finally tore this talented band<br />apart). With the likes of Steely Dan, Joni Mithell, Bonnie Raitt,<br />Boz Scaggs, the Eagles and so many more. These Supertramp tracks<br />featured on this collection will endure for years to come and<br />the quality and care set them apart from all the rest. Good to<br />see them remaster the previous best of collection, the 70's had<br />many many excellent musicans, many still out there going strong.
0471381985|5.0|I have read numerous books on the topic of investing, including Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, One Up on Wall Street, Beat the Street, The Warren Buffett Way, and more.  But this book is the most detailed and usefully instructive that I have found - at least since The Intelligent Investor.  If you have an interest in accurately modeling the investment philosophies of the most successful investors, you will find this book to be invaluable.
B00005RZV4|5.0|All I can say is wow.  This is most likely the best live album ever.  Starts out strong with Terrible Lie, Sin, &amp; March Of The Pigs.  Throws in some nice classic songs in the middle.  And finishes of with mostly the mainstream stuff.  After listening to this album I must experience Nine Inch Nails live in person.
B00003CXXI|4.0|To say this movie is a laugh a minute is almost an understatement. I have never been so intrigued by any animation to date.<br /><br />The fact that characters from various fairy tales kept appearing was highly amusing to both my husband and I. We could not stop laughing! Finally, we found another movie we could both enjoy. We loved the three blind mice!<br /><br />Basically, the fairy-tale characters are driven from their land/homes and they are sent to the swamp inhabited by Shrek the ogre. In his attempt to get Lord Farquaad to allow the characters to return to their homes, he finds a new purpose and mission. He is sent to rescue the fair Princess Fiona who is quite the character.<br /><br />The fact that this animation also included a dragon and a princess in a castle tower was just so perfect. Everything was spectacular as far as the animation went and I was especially impressed with the castles and molten lava.<br /><br />Without Eddie Murphy's voice, the donkey would not have been half as funny. Shrek also has a wonderful Scottish accent. The friendship between Shrek and the donkey kept reminding me of the movie: \\"What about Bob?\\" for some reason and was equally comical.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the Karaoke scenes, but those are after the movie. Most kids won't get the adult humor, but the crudeness here and there was definitely not necessary and was just too \\"adolescent male\\" for my \\"over 30 female\\" tastes.<br /><br />Not for younger kids because of the adult humor in places. Pity, this could have been a really good family film and it brings out various aspects I thought could be great lessons for kids. Like accepting people for who they are, not for how they look, etc.<br /><br />Romantic in places and ROFLOL funny. In a way, it is a reality check for everyone who likes to live in fantasy land.<br /><br />@-->-->---<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B000003BEV|5.0|This album, made in 1967 at the peek of \\"Flower Power\\" has been hacked down so many times over the years that I  believe it needs some could coverage in it's defence! <br />Firstly, Santanics is one of the boldest titles to come out of England at that time and the cover is histerical! The music was an attempt to reach the sounds of the times and when I first heard the whole album on CD back in 1987 I thought it was quite lame, especially if your listening to King Crimson and the like.<br />What I realized after repeated listenings was that it is one of The Stones most interesting and expierimental albums! If you also consider their lame attempt on Aftermath to do an uninspired blues (\\"I'm going home\\") that stetched at more than 11 minutes oviously copying quite unimaginativly The Doors epic \\"The End\\" and failing so hard that in comparison, Satanics is truly an unintentional Masterpiece!<br />The record flows with The Beatles (John and Paul) actuwaly singing in \\"Why dont we sing this all together?\\" and \\"Shes a Rainbow.\\" The songs are stranger than usuwal and we here a punk element for the first time as well as \\"Tape editing\\" , something we would never get again from the boys!<br />This is one of my favorite Stones albums and over the years it has really grown on me. It is not typical Stones fair and that is what makes it special. Do not expect great creative original music in the Psycedelic vain (like King Crimson!) and instead sit back, roll a joint and dig a Rolling Stones Pyscedelic wonder of the 1960s....this album ROCKS!!! - Hope this helps!<br />
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater just gets better, and better, and better.  Thinking that SFAM couldn't be topped, I was mistaken.  Not one second of the first disc is mediocre, and the second disc commands full attention throughout.  I love this band, and their consistent style.  If it wasn't for Zep, I'd vote for them as the greatest band, ever.  Simply amazing.
0441172717|5.0|The mother of all modern sci-fi, this book is a testiment to contemperary literature.
6302914191|5.0|While I love watching the video's, not having seen any since the original airing, the video quality reminds me of the Seinfeld episode when Brody was making bootleg movies with his camcorder. The films are grainy, out of focus, blurry. The only saving grace is the surround soundtrack which is crisp and clear. Worldvision Home Video should invest in some modern equipment or find a new supplier to produce these video's.
B00005T33W|1.0|What a constipated movie.  Nobody accomplishes anything except for the best friend who actually gets a job and an apartment, while our hero whines, mopes and ruins every opportunity she gets.<br />These characters were supposed to be cynical and witty, but they were simply self-absorbed losers.  With the exception of Seymour, I didn't see any sign of intelligence in this whole movie.  Many people like to think that misanthropy equals intelligence.  That sort of attitude is repugnant, not to mention transparent (to everyone but the ones who hold that attitude).  Feeling superior to others does not make one superior.<br />Watching Enid manipulate Rebecca's feelings made me cringe.  Whenever a man showed interest in Blondie, Enid chased him away.  Whenever Rebecca showed an opinion differing from her own, Enid would ridicule her.  With friends like her...<br />Enid is so lonely, yet when people try to reach out to her, she treats them like dirt.  A giggly classmate tries to be friendly, and Enid responds with phony politeness and then ridicules the girl after she leaves.  Dad's girlfriend tries to forge a bond, and is met with unexplained hostility. Maybe if we could see a reason for Enid's dislike for the woman, we would empathize more. Instead, it seems like Enid is simply spiteful.  Which, judging from her idea of fun (setting up people for pain and humiliation), is most likely the case.<br />Also, Enid's utter laziness and immaturity were irritating.  I've known plenty of people who supposedly had great talent, just like Enid was supposed to have (although her sketchbook drawings looked like webtoons drawn by eighth graders).  But her lack of drive showed her to be just another talented waste, which is not endearing.  <br />Are we supposed to identify with her?  We all have periods where we have lack of direction.  But for crying out loud, her teacher offers her a scholarship, her friend offers to share an apartment, her father's girlfriend offers her a job, and this loser does NOTHING.  That's not lack of direction and confusion, that's just plain pathetic.<br />Comparing this movie to 'Rushmore' is an insult to a great movie.  'Rushmore' showed characters with heart and real intelligence, not this dull 'Reality Bites'-wannabe crap.  Max Fischer felt alienated because he was quirky and unique.  Enid's alienation is caused by her hatefulness and childishness.  <br />A character who feels superior to the people around her while she herself is a not-too-bright slacker might have been a good satire.  But the writers seemed to be unaware of the irony of their bratty hero.  Instead, we are left with a dull movie about a person who deserves her alienated angst.
B000002BFL|2.0|I hesistate to give this album less than three stars because of who this is. Springsteen is an important artist who justly demands respect, and I applaud him for doing whatever he feels like regardless of whether it's commercial. However, listening objectively, I find this album just doesn't work. An entire album's worth of barely audible guitar picking and intense muttering (and occasionally offkey singing) has tremendous potential to put you to sleep, except for the occasional Dylan-esque harmonica solo which may jar you unpleasantly awake. Springsteen already did a pared-down album before with &quot;Nebraska,&quot; and this odd attempt to be Woody Guthrie doesn't really hold up all that well in its general lack of melodies and overunderstatement (to coin a word.) The title song improves with listening, and the lyrics are competent.
0393314804|5.0|After watching the contraversial film, \\"Trainspotting\\" I decided that i might as well give the book a shot too The intense Scottish dialect will be offputting for those who are not used to it! However as a native Scot, the dialect only acts to convey a more vivid image of the characters portrayed. While some people will be offended by the strong language and chilling imagery depicted by Welsh, those willing to open their mind to the fact that the novel portrays a very realistic picture of Edinburgh's gritty underworld will realse that the book says a lot about life.<br />Written with skill, Trainspotting is a poignant story. It made me laugh, it made me cry, read it with an open mind and accept Welsh's direct approach.
B0000024IE|1.0|Never excuse racism in the name of art.  Many have heaped praise on these creative but racist rappers.  I won't.  Needless to say, if this had been recorded vice versa by &quot;crakas&quot;, it would be universally condemned.  That is a double standard I will not endorse.  &quot;Elvis was simple... racist&quot; shows ignorance of the facts and a kind of twisted, racist/artistic jealousy.  Chuck D., you can be obsessed with race and continue spewing hate, or move past it as Malcolm eventually did.  Life is short.  Do some good.  Malcolm &amp; Martin did.  So did Elvis.
B00005R2BG|1.0|I had high expectations when I went to see this film.  But I was so disappointed I left sometime past the first hour.  For one, I somehow had the impression it was going to be about turn of the (20th) century Paris.  It was not. Instead of a Parisian set, the viewer is given computer animation--as one might see in a video game.  The dialogue and the characters, likewise, have little to do with that era.  <br />After the opening, swooping, computer-created visuals of Paris, the viewer sees a typewriter working while the unseen narrator talks. This scene seems to go on forever; however, I should have appreciated it more for most everything that follows is like a high-speed roller coaster.  Viewers eventually see the lead character, Ewan McGregor, as he inexplicably falls through the floor of his apartment into another where several characters (or should I say caricatures) are rehearsing a play.  McGregor offers a cliched line or two to the group and they are impressed by his apparent talent.  Later, McGregor and crew go to a dance show where he sees Nicole Kidman performing.  He falls in love with her at first site.  She passes out during the performance and, well, one can see without too much imagination how the plot might develop.  One other twist: she is apparently already spoken for--by the Duke.<br />Maybe it's because I'm over 40 but the non-stop, jerky, in-your-face camera movements were simply exhausting, not exhilirating.  Indeed, their manic, aggressive pace made me wonder if the  director wasn't under some kind of chemical inducement.  <br />Moulin Rouge is a musical.  But there is no original music.  Instead, it is filled with 70s pop songs.  So much for Paris.  McGregor sings &quot;Your Song,&quot; a nice song, to Kidman many, many times.  Otherwise, bits of various songs, e.g., &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot; are awkwardly pushed into the dialogue.  It really stuck me as amateurish--something anyone could put together.<br />The romance between McGregor andKidman is surely a highlight to many.  Of course their features: his blue eyes, her smooth skin, are computer-enhanced to achieve the maximum effect. <br />There are other memorable moments, such as when she is flopping about on the floor trying to fool the Duke, like a child trying to fool a parent. But the Duke, unlike the parent, doesn't seem to have a clue.  <br />Viewers should not assume this is a great movie because it is nominated for Oscars.  Evidently it is popular but I for one find little to recommend.
B00005A1PR|5.0|with so many sound-alike pop groups, rappers,etc.  its nice to see artists with unique qualities like India Arie.  Her strong writting and solid musical skills gives her music an alluring and passionate character.  Very few artists display musical maturity on their first debut album, and I have to say that India Arie is one of the few that do show this maturity.  &quot;Strength, Courage, and Wisdom&quot; is my favorite track off of Acoustic soul.  Its passionate, emotional, and definately the most inspiring for me.  The cd is a must in everyone's R&amp;B collection..so if you dont have it by now...you dont know what your missing!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Never did a soundtrack truly played the movie's theme right. The composer responsible for the music should have understood the movie outright to capture its essence. This was done in a few that I can recall at th4e moment, but the greatest achievement of this union between sound and vision could best be seen in the Godfather.<br />Now though the Godfather's sound was sad, even though we were introduced to the theme while in a wedding, the sound created by Mansell in Requiem for a Dream is best and only described as haunting. It captures you both in the movie and once you pop it in your CD player. From the beginning of the theme to its end, you're just captured into a world other than the one we live in, but incredibly similar. While the movie used a great amount of shock techniques, the music retained its haunting fervor throughout. The use of violens and the mix of synthesizers' beats just proved that opposite do attract at times.<br />If you watch the movie, you would definitely want to buy the soundtrack to remember teh scenes over and over again. If you just buy the soundtrack, you can appreciate true music genius at its best. You just can pinpoint a classification for the sound. It's not new age, and certainly not classic. It's that limbo in between where the best of two worlds can merge and create a soothing rhythm to the soul.
0345440803|1.0|I never read her first book on infants but Hogg's \\"insights\\" into toddlers rates no greater than those of the average parent.  This book is all over the place and attempts to cover nearly every aspect of a toddler's life, from developmental milestones to switching to solid foods to stopping temper tantrums.  Unfortunately, none of the topics are covered completely or affectively.  Her tip to help with dressing a toddler (\\"buy loose clothes with elasticized waists, big buttons and Velcro closures\\") is an example of the elementary tactics offered.<br />I was looking for a book to help me understand my toddlers (I have twins) and how to best work with them, especially during the challenging times of disciplining.  But even during the rare times that the book delves into helpful topics, such as determining your toddler's temperament/type, the following chapters do not build on the information.  So now I know that one of my toddlers is \\"spirited\\" and one is an \\"angel\\"; so what?<br />An even greater concern for me is the judgmental and condescending tone of this book.  Other books have offered me far better lessons and motivated me to change my behavior without making me feel like a completely incompetent parent.<br />The few insights that I gleaned from this book are available in much more comprehensive and less patronizing texts, including Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline by Becky A. Baily; and Your Two-Year-Old, Terrible or Tender and Your Three-Year-Old, Friend or Enemy by Louse Bates Ames.  I'm sure may more sources are out there but these have really helped me be a much more understanding, patient and loving parent.

B00005QZ7U|3.0|Baz Luhrmann brings back the musical to the movie scene with Moulin Rogue.  Mr. Luhrmann succeeds with the visual aspect of the movie.  The imagery is striking with stunning sets and beautiful cinematography.  Nicole Kidman is absolute breath taking as the doomed Satine.  She shines every moment she graces the screen.  The problem with Moulin Rogue is that the storyline is weak and there are basically no original songs.  The movie is based in 1899, but the songs are mostly from the rock era.  In one scene a young writer played by Ewen MacGregor sings Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; to Ms. Kidman and in another the Moulin Rogue's owner Jim Broadbent sings &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; to a Duke (Played snarkly by Richard Roxborough) who is in love Satine and wants her in return for financing a play.  It is a weird juxtaposition of time periods that works to a degree because the songs have a built in popularity, but it lacks the creativity of the original scores for musicals of old.  Overall, Moulin Rogue is worth watching for the look and Ms. Kidman.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Despite many hints throughout the movie pointing to classical philosophy, no one seems to have picked up on that.  Its not surprising, given the fact no one knows what satire is anymore, let alone finds it funny.  The most amazing thing about this movie is the seamless blending of classical humor with pop culture buffoonery.  <br />The best part of this movie however is the obviously funny scenes that are either raved about or ripped on are obviously poking fun at mainstream culture.  The movie ends with the main character having to pass a test on the Republic and Phaedo.  As these were the two works where Plato outlined his conception of the forms, it comes as no surprise that this movie is entirely basing its humor on the absurdity of the close minded masses.  Just as the cave dwellers were incapable of perceiving reality, only shadows, most of the humor as well as the point of this movie is entirely missed by those who have never laughed at anything but buffoonery and insults.  It is unfortunate, because for those who laugh at the absurdity of life, we have little mass media art available to us.  This is a movie you can really laugh at with your friends, instead of shaking your head with dismay at the repulsive humor of most movies.  Of course, you won't be laughing at the same things as them really, but they won't know the difference.<br />Everyone raves that Green is the only funny character...  This movie very very closely follows the Greek theatrical form.  All the main characters are archetypes of a particular personality type you would find in a top 500 university.  Green plays the role of the chorus, mirroring what the average audience is likely to be thinking.  Of course, he is the one with whom most identify.  They don't realize he is really making fun of HIM.  For those who critique the sexual content of the movie, most of it is presented in an egregarious fashion to point out how absurd sexual obsession is.  When the movie ends, you will find the refrain of the song is something to the effect of \\"Now I know love and happiness are not the same\\".  Even though philosophers have for ages proven time and again that our relationship-love-sex oriented lives are hollow, 98% of Americans focus their entire life on one of those things virtually all the time.  This movie ultimately tries to shatter that irrational view.<br />This movie will make you laugh about the absurdity of sexual monogamy, love and religious obsessions, rule based ethics in general, racial cliques (ie the black frat scene), asexual old people, aggressive meatheads, drug laws, you name it...  This movie covers so much ground.  But sadly, you have to be an atheist to enjoy this movie.  Otherwise, you will be deeply offended.  Theists, be warned.
B0000041Q3|5.0|L. Pavarotti really does it this time. His sweet tenor melts all hearts in this world class &quot;Turandot&quot;. He is supported by two of the most splendid divas of the 70's, Caballe and Sutherland. Pavarotti's singing of &quot;Nessum Dorma&quot; is triumphant. And all of Calaf's difficult high tessituras are easily and beautifully executed. He is in a class of his own among the contemporary tenors of our time. Certainly far superior to you know who(wink..)<BR>The two divas are obviously Pavarotti's match, and they set the standard for the roles of Turandot and Liu. Sutherland is both powerful in sound yet ever so convincing as a cold princess who fell in love with a stranger.<BR>Caballe's Liu is a lesson in phrasing. Really, I don't think her portrait of the slave girl can be beat. Yet she does not upstage Sutherland, she supports her. It is a pleasure that all three principles work together beautifully, rather than trying to outsing each other. And that's the reason that this Turandot is one of the most satisfying opera recording that I own. And the singing by Sutherland, Pavarotti, and Caballe can only be describe as sublime...
6305508550|5.0|I bought this movie based solely on the recommendations of friends.  And I was not dissapointed.  Office life is drawn with a fine and satirical hand.  God, I spent half my time laughing and half my time shaking my head at my own life as a techie.  Definitely worth the price of the movie.
630349255X|5.0|The English language has one of the largest vocabularies of any language on Earth.  No combination of those words can accurately portray the feeling many people get while watching this film.  There are those out there who would not appreciate this quality, as there is nearly no action, plot, or words in it.  But for those of you that can sit still and simply watch for a couple hours will never forget this film.  <br />From Monkies relaxing in Japan's hot springs to the iguanas on the shores of Galapagos to a Buddhist monk walking through Shinjuku station in Japan, there is powerful emotion brought into one's mind about the idea of life and one's concept of the world.  I feel one of the themes of Baraka is the conflict of human technology and nature.  But even with the the conflict and destruction that the human technology brings, you can witness its clockwork-like beauty in dense cities like New York or Hong Kong.  There are other parallels between the densely populated South American cities and gravesites.  The same parallel flows with Shinjuku station and the egg factory.  It is a great metaphorical representation that you couldn't quite put into words.  You would have to be Blake to capture Baraka's beauty and you would have to be Vonnegut to reach the level of irony and cynisism it provides the viewers with.<br />Baraka is a fine representation of 70mm film.<br />I cannot reccomend it strongly enough.
B000002H2H|5.0|Well, I'm sure everyone who reads this agrees that this one deserves 5 stars, except for maybe \\"James Hendrix\\". Lightning has many melodies and is pretty technical. Call of Ktulu is a very cool intrumental and sounds like it would be good to cast spells with, or something! And, you guessed it, Creeping Death is featured here. What?, you don't think I chose that name for nothing, do you? It's albums like this one, that blows Megadeth out of the water.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|when i bought the DVD i was amazed when i watched it. i've never seen a film as funny, brilliant and sad as this one. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor are amazing as Satine and Christian and they act out the best love story i've ever seen which left me in tears. they're performances are incredible and it is obvious that they are great singers and actors.i would recomend this DVD to anyone because it doesn't matter who you are there is no way that anyone could not love this movie. its made me laugh at parts and cry (alot!) in others.Kidman and Mcgregor make this film what it is...totally amazing.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Well, here you go! Possibly Sabbath's best. But I'm not sure, I tend to say that about every one of them. This one include the mammoth song Megalomania. If you haven't heard this song, man!, do I feel sorry for you!! One of my favorite songs Symptom of the Universe is included and alone is worth the [PRICE]. Sabotage has some of the evilest sounding laughs in between Am I Going Insane and The Writ. BAD! It's records like this that make me wish I grew up in the 70s.
B00005OAIE|4.0|John Mayer is rather young (early 20's) but his songs are full of introspection and intelligence. As someone at the same point in life, I find he is saying exactly what I am feeling at times. \\"83\\" is a great song for those of us who wish we could go back to simpler, happier days. \\"No Such Thing\\" is a great coming-of-age song. <br />Another great song is \\"My Stupid Mouth.\\" I have to disagree with the Amazon review that says it would have been better if he told us what he said. No! It's the mystery that helps make it catchy. And \\"St. Patrick's Day\\" is a great song for anyone who has ever been in a relationship because they were too scared to be alone.<br />Altogether, Mayer has some brilliant lyrics, heartfelt singing, and smooth style. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it was a little uneven: there are several fantastic songs, but some are just flat.<br />PS I saw him in concert with Glen Phillips (formerly of Toad the Wet Sprocket) and they were both awesome. Mayer held his own opening for the legendary Toad frontman.
B000002KE2|5.0|Although quite different from their first three releses, Vol. 4 contains some of the bands best song writing. From the piano in Changes, to the raw righteousness of Snowblind, Sabbath delivers! I think this is a very well rounded album; it has something for everyone. The guitar intro in Under The Sun kind of sounds like a death metal riff. It is a very dark, heavy riff that contrasts well with the previously mentioned Changes. FX is rather odd, and isn't a song, but it's interesting. How could I not give a Sabbath record with Ozzy 5 stars? This is another classic!
0800177177|5.0|It it just me, or does it seem like the guy below me work for Columbia Pictures???? Way to blow some sunshine, pal.
B000002KDO|5.0|Very cool disc. One of my personal favorites, and I just happen to be listening to it as I type this. Well, what can I say?...it's a classic and one of Black Sabbath's best. I'm sure other reviews have covered all the bases on this one so I'll just encourage you to obtain a copy as soon as possible.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|an enlighted meditative piece of art. it takes you away from everything and leaves your mind with bliss and beauty.
B000002KB8|5.0|This record was recorded very inexpensively, but that's the way it should be. Some might say the production sucks, but I love it. It's one of those classic records that you can keep turning up and it's sounds better and better. You know how some albums are over produced and are hard to get loud? well think aint one! Actually, this remains one of the best records EVER, 32 years later. You know Korn won't be like that in 32 years!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Yes, a dozen of songs are not on original &quot;MONO&quot; version! I got all the previous release CD of &quot;MONO&quot; version. The record company would need more money for issue this CD album.  This is a record for young lovers !<br />I hope the record company should re-issue the CD version of &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; and &quot;Love Songs&quot;.
068817776X|5.0|This is an excellent book. I couldn't put it down and I felt like I was living right along with the author. I was just as charmed by Werner as she was and I was horrified to see how he treated her when he came home. Even though their marrige ended badly, I think that they really grew to love each other. It's an amazing amazing story...
B000002UCN|3.0|Although I have full collection of &quot;The Beatles's CD&quot;, I still want to own this CD.  Because I love George Harrison's song, such as &quot;Here comes the Sun&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; , &quot;You&quot; and What is Life&quot;. But I also like &quot;Ding Dong, Ding Dong&quot; which was a song in the chart.<br />I hope the record company would issue the real &quot; George Harrsion solo best album&quot; in the near furture. Do not try to include any Beatles in the album. I would like to include some songs from &quot;Somewhere in England&quot;, Cloud Nine&quot;. There are a lot of George's solo hits!
B00005214X|5.0|I'm one of those few oddballs that enjoys the post-Beatles solo work more than the Beatles proper. That said, I firmly believe that &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is the greatest thing to every emerge from any of the Fab Four.<br />Just about everything on this record is AAA material. From the slow to the rocking, just about every song on the album works. I could easily do without the half-CD-worth of jams, but it's far from the worst 70's self-indulgence you'll hear, so its presence hardly bothers me. The testament to the greatness of this album is how well these songs, many of whoch have become familiar over the years, have held up. Despite Harrison's lambasting of Phil Spector's dense production, I think the record is one of the most tasteful things Spector ever did. With the new remastering, instead of a wall of &quot;mush&quot; heard on the old CD issue, you get the patented Wall of Sound... and, with the right stereo, you can hear each invidual track that comprises said wall. In that respect, it's even better than the LP-- more resolution. Harrion's voice also sounds warmer, even if it is still buried in the mix. This is one of the most obviously improved &quot;Remasters&quot; available and worth your money if you love the album. If you don't have the album yet, go buy it. I can't imagine anyone not liking this album. It has a warm, big-hearted sound--- alternately sad and silly, sometimes both. There is a countryish blusey feel to a lot fo the tracks, Harrison sings better than he ever did, and of course writes the best songs of his career. The wonderful thing about this album is that it never for a moment sounds &quot;dated&quot;, like so much music from the 60's-70's (Beatles included) does to me. This album could have Come out on Sub Pop or Bloodshot last year--- or 30 years ago--- it's timeless, and there are only a handful of records you could say that about.<br />There is a lush, honesty, almost pastoral feel to this album--- you'll sit down to hear one track, and listen to the whole thing. Even a song like &quot;My sweet lord&quot; which is both overplayed and about a subject which I'm not interested in, remains absolutely irresistable, with it's huge multi-tracked choruses at the end. Harrison's singing is nuanced, understated and quietly powerful... And he plays some of the best lead guitar ever layed down on tape!<br />The package is nicely done with a colorized cover (weird looking but nice), seperate sleeves for each of the discs, great liner notes... all in all a great reissue of a true masterpiece.
B000002MJ0|5.0|This classic record is a must for everyone who enjoys indierock, because its much more than dreamy shoegazing, the term that my bloody valentine always is refered to. The record is jangly, melodic, garage-rocky, experimental, dreamy, druggy, lo-fi etc etc etc. And all of it combined makes this a really special record to enjoy because all of the musical cornerstones fits and makes a perfect union. Very few bands can do that.<BR>When I bought the record I hated it at first because I wanted another Loveless. I sure didnt enjoy the lo-fi sound on this but after a few listenings I started to enjoy it. I started to discover how great the songwriting was. A year later when I had listened to it more and more I realized what a masterpiece I had got my hands on. Buy this one and give it some listening before you judge it to hard. If you give Isnt Anything a little time it will give you a great experience.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This thing is just an awesome listening experience, rammstein i guess just will keep getting better with time, i mean this album without a doubt is better than disturbed or system, much cleaner than iowa, and better than what metallica used 2 be.  U have 2 listen 2 this thing more than once to get the emotion and anger of the music and lyrics, and u get a sound that is different for the band, but still has THEIR original sound to it, they seemingly expereminted with new stuff and aced it on the first try.  Every track on this album could be a single if not for the lyrics on a few of the tracks, but i havnent heard an album with 11 singles ever, write if u can find one.  The bands lyrics r quite impressive and give u something 2 think about, especially mutter, especially zwitter, and they make a statement with Links 2 3 4.  i dont know, i am just another rammstein fan, but they r quickly becoming the only band i listen 2, i just hate the mtvs and radiostations of the world, if they would just play their music....but theyll have their day....
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen.  I ran across it while channel surfing the cable movie channels, and was pulled in immediately.  Conceptually, a movie that moves backward in time sounds contrived and very difficult to pull off.  Memento pulls it off beautifully with strong performances from the three key actors, Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano.  <br />Memento is my favorite movie from 2001!!!
6305428557|5.0|This is a GREAT little movie that is set in and was filmed in Wales, about a group of townspeople whose pride was challenged by the vageries of bureaucracy, where their local &quot;mountain&quot; turned out to be a &quot;hill&quot; under British definitions.  The challenge united the town under the leadership of &quot;Morgan the Goat&quot; (Colm Meaney)and his nemesis, the town vicar, to overcome their mountain's classification by the British Geographical Survey, Hugh Grant, who sees what's going on and comes around to the town's side.<br />This is supposedly based on a true story which makes it even more interesting.  The soundtrack fits perfectly and reminds me of the &quot;Chocolat&quot; soundtrack.  There aren't many extras but for the price, you can't lose.
B00005JKQX|1.0|A very boring movie.  Yes, it might get the facts about schizophrenia correct, and Russell Crowe's peformance might be an accurate depiction of the surface symptoms of schizophrenia, but that doesn't make it a good movie.<br />The script is one gimmick after another.  The direction is completely pedestrian.  The entire enterprise is dull and predictable.  <br />To be fair, Crowe does his best, but he can't transcend the essential dullness of Ron Howard's TV Movie Of The Week direction.
B000002HHB|5.0|Starting out, let me say I am a huge heavy/hardcore music fan.  My list of favorite bands include Tool, Nothingface (Violence; best album no one has heard of), Skipknot, etc.  But when I first heard Tigerlily at my former girlfriend's house, I was hooked.  Incredibly deep and touching lyrical base, coupled with first rate musicians and topped of with Ms. Merchant's smoldering vocals, this album is fantastic.  A great CD to toss on while entertaining....
B00005T30L|5.0|I rented this movie based on the fact that it was praised by critics everywhere, but I really didn't know what to expect.  To my surprise, \\"Ghost World\\" was hilarious, touching and sad all at the same time.  I could totally relate to Thora Birch's character!  It's pretty rare that I can watch a movie and identify with a character that much!  Enid and Rebecca were \\"real\\" characters and not like your typical characters in silly movies like \\"American Pie\\", which make teens out to be only sex obsessed, lazy fools (alright, many teens are, but they're also so much more than that).  I was pleasently surprised by \\"Ghost World\\"!  So much, in fact, that I think I'll buy it!
0790744759|5.0|This movie traces every season, combining romance, tribulation, humor and wonderful music, including Judy Garland singing,&quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot;. It's best feel good movie ever made. Can't go a single Christmas without watching it again. It's a great movie for young and old. The little girl, Tudy, does a wonderful job of winning the audience, adding a capricious touch of mischievious innocense to the already lovely story.
B000002KCI|5.0|I didn't even know this CD existed until I saw it on a few of those &quot;Top 10 CDs from an artist&quot; type things you see at this site.  Every song is solid.  My only gripe is that the CD is only 36 mins long.  Neil, where is the rest of this CD?!?!?!?
0783240236|5.0|I have been quietly afraid to see this movie as I was certain that Hitchcock's movie would scare the... out of me and have me fearing birds forever...This movie is a great show of Hitch's ability to deliver fear on a silver platter and keep it so stylish that I couldn't wait for the continuing scenes. It wasn't scary like I thought it would be, but suspenseful beyond my imagination! <BR>An excellent movie and a perfect example of suspense and classic Hitchcock!
B000002GYI|5.0|from a Beat&Sample Perspective this is Very Original all the way.alot of the material here influenced alot of 80's pop.very simple but on point.not to be overlooked at all.
B00004VW35|3.0|One of Neil Young's strong suits (among many) is that he is unpredictable. At no time was this more apparent than during that phase in the mid-80s when he went from techno to rockabilly to country to blues-- a period in his career that I call \\"genre hell.\\" Eventually, Neil pretty much went back to being Neil, and all was well again. <BR>Unsurprisingly, Neil's music during this time was wildly uneven. Case in point: his \\"country\\" album, Old Ways. Some cuts are essential: \\"My Boy\\" and \\"Bound For Glory\\" channel the genre in a way that doesn't submerge Neil's genius for melody and heartfelt lyrics. Other tracks, however, seem (in the words of another reviewer) like a country-music \\"caricature.\\" For example, the Jew's harp solos in \\"Get Back To The Country\\" are flat-out silly. A couple of tracks, in fact are downright unlistenable (\\"The Wayward Wind,\\" \\"Misfits\\")-- quite a statement from a hardcore Neil-ist such as myself. <BR>Also of interest are the appearances by a variety of country/bluegrass luminaries, such as Willie Nelson, Bela Fleck and the late, great Waylon Jennings.<BR>While this album is still a worthwhile chapter (and, a mercifully brief one) in the Neil Young lexicon, don't expect something as stellar as \\"Harvest,\\" \\"Comes A Time\\" or \\"Harvest Moon.\\"
B00005V9QJ|3.0|I have followed Sade's Career for a long time.She was a Neo-Soul Artist before it had that Name.Her tempo&groove then as now hasn't changed nor Her Band.Live is just like the Record Essentially.you don't get any changes in the Arrangements here.very much on Script.Sade has a Aura about Herself but too bad She doesn't take more Challenges? She might shock some folks.nothing here overall is far from what you already know&have.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|What are the folks out in tinsel land thinking?  Moulin Rouge was awful--yes, just awful, not even worthy of the one star I have given it.  Yes, it may be an extravaganza, but what does this word really mean?  Is it meant to portray this garish concoction of fin-du-ciecle cabaret pierced with groteseque 21st century sexuality and voiced with the modern songs of Elton John etc. ?  The skewed camera angles peeking up the voluminous skirts revealing fish-netted thunder-thighs (Ugh) gave me the frantic, queasy feeling that I was participating in a stale rendition of a neverending Mardi Gras gone awry after four or five days guzzling of cheap beer.<br />The star goes to poor Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--I have to wonder why people of this acting caliber would ever want to be in such a film unless it was done solely for charity.<br />Relieved that I did not see this one on the big screen as there would have been absolutely no escape other than leaving the theatre before the film's end.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Ok check it out, I'm gonna give you the real deal on this one. This is by far the most impressive performance I have seen, not only by Britney... by anybody. Live In Las Vegas is Brit's first live show and a must see for any fan. She performes all of the multi-platinum hits, as well as many off of her new album Britney. This Woman is quite an amazing site that I promise will keep you glued to the screen up until the unbelievable grand finale! Everyone go out and buy this DVD it is a purchase you will not regret.
0553801481|4.0|I recently acquired this title, and sat down to read it.  I found it just as captivating as the previous \\"Assassin\\" series of which this is a follow up.  It took a time for the story to get off the floor, but once everyone was established you didn't want to put it down.  <br />Our fatilistic hero is in top form as ever.  With grudging and guilt ridden inevitability resuming the duties to the Farseer family and world fate.  He searches for peace for himself and strives to be left alone, while saving everyone else <br />New twists have been added to the tale, and new factions have joined in to curl the coil so to speak.  <br />I await the continuation of this series with baited breath.
0684859106|3.0|I have tried making the recipe for yellow cupcakes (what I assumed they made in their shop here in NYC) and everytime I make them they are tasty but come out like dense little poundcakes, not as fluffy as they could be. Anyone else have this problem?
6303014100|5.0|Three miles from my house here in Bedford, PA are ancient scars in the side of a mountain.  They were entrenchments dug during the Gettysburg Campaign -- in case General Lee's forces headed north to cut off railroad lines at Altoona.  Those trenches were dug by locals but never used.  They are still clearly discernible.<BR> My great grandfather was Bedford County, PA's last living Civil War veteran (he died in 1942 at age 96).  He was in a PA Regiment that MISSED Gettysburg: his unit was at Vicksburg which fell the same day the battle in PA ended.<BR> I have viewed this movie many times.  Its careful attention to tactical details seems perfect.  The actors are well-cast despite somewhat ersatz-looking beards and moustaches.  However, considering July in PA and wool uniforms the real soldiers wore, I doubt they were much &quot;handsomer&quot; than our actors.  <BR> A comment on General Lee.  Some have objected to Martin Sheen's portrayal.  Lee, at the time, was suffering from an increasingly harsh heart condition that, in time, would take him.  I believe that was factored into the movie, although subtly.  Sheen shows his understanding of this generally little-known fact.<BR> Chamberlain and Longstreet were excellently played, as was CSA General Armitage.  In fact, considering the complex nature of this work (not a 'film' but a 'work') Mr. Maxwell rates high praise.<BR> I visit the National Military Park at Gettysburg when my spirits flag.  Every time I reclaim my honor and love for being a U.S. citizen.  No matter which side, the men for whom Gettysburg is portrayed, all were heroes.<BR> The real difference? Today we are callused of spirit.  The men of Gettysburg's time had a refreshing naievete' and sentimentality.  We might be better people if we laughed and cried easier -- and for real reasons and not artifice.<BR> CAPT Steve Myers, USN (Ret.)
B00005U1YO|2.0|I've enjoyed the Chemical brothers older work, but this CD is OK, not great. It doesn't sound fresh, and some of the tracks are somewhat annoying.  I would recommend &quot;Surrender&quot; if you want a solid collection of their style/work, but this album misses.
B00005JKED|4.0|There is an armchair casting director in all of us and we all imagine certain actors as naturals for certain roles. Alonzo Harris, the central character in \\"Training Day\\" is a corrupt, brutal cop who shakes down drug dealers, roughs up citizens, samples confiscated crack and has few slams of Jack Daniels in the morning to take the edge off. It's a role that seems beg the casting of Robert DeNiro or Sean Penn. The fact that good guy, African American actor Denzel Washington is cast as Alonzo Harris runs counter to casting stereotypes. Washington is amoral, predatory and \\"one screwdriver short of a toolbox\\", as he gleefully shows drug unit trainee Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) how to plunder and pillage the community he's sworn to protect. Washington clearly relishes the chance to play a throughly disreputable character and Ethan Hawke's decent cop becomes the reluctant straight man as Washington spins further and further out of control. The movie is laced with so much adrenaline that I felt exhaused at the end as if I had spent the day in training with Denzel's looney bird \\"supervisor\\".<br />The direction by Antoine Fuqua is suitably cartoonish and he shows off his MTV video chops with; fast cut and double-take editing, loopy stoner camera angles and tight shots, jarring blasts of sound and hyperactive pacing. The script is contrived and the plot has enough holes in it to drive a paddy wagon through, but, hey man, this ain't \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" we're talking about here. \\"Training Day\\" is Denzel's showcase and I am hoping that Denzel will get a well deserved Best Actor Oscar at last.
6305949980|5.0|I saw &quot;...Nightmare...&quot; in the theater when it came out, and I know I blurted, with the first notes of the music,&quot;This is great!&quot; Though I already expected to like a Tim Burton project, it was better than  I could have imagined. There is nothing about this film I don't love. Your other reviewers have expressed it much more eloquently. My best friend cannot imagine why my wife and I are so crazy about it, but we are. &quot;...Nightmare...&quot; is the first film we watch after Thanksgiving each year to usher in the Christmas season at our house. I treasure my laserdisc boxed set,and we have a vhs &quot;traveling&quot; copy, but the dvd is much better. Get this film!
6304806442|4.0|Though this film can be extremely violent and grotesque at times, it certainly gives the viewer an inside look into the ravaging world of heroin in Scotland.  It is incredibly well-acted, featuring powerhouse performances from Ewan McGregor (Moulin Rouge!) and Johnny Lee Miller (Dracula 2000).  Some of the characters are rather hard to understand at times, due to the thick Scotish accents, but for the most part, the cast does a great job.  The plot revolves around a close-knit group of friends who dabble in heroin, among other things.  We follow them on their downward spiral, seeing what the power of addiction can lead to.  The only problem with the film is how shockingly brutal it is.  Some of the images brought forth will haunt the viewer for days, and this is no exaggeration.  If you can handle the violence, Trainspotting is certainly worth your time.
B00005R24G|5.0|Most of the reviews here refer to the OLD DVD edition (notice they are all from 2000 or before). The edition offered here is NEW, and a vast improvement. Don't let the old reviews prevent you from buying this new DVD.
B00003CXXP|1.0|What's the difference between A.I. and a bucket of shit?  The bucket. The only thing worse than a bad movie is a long bad movie.<BR>Don't waste your time or money.  <BR>Huge disappointment!  <BR>5 stars?  <BR>I didn't know so many people smoked crack.
B00005B36H|5.0|An absolute masterpiece.  Tool is on a higher plateau and simply cannot be touched by anyone.  Best vocalist, guitarist, bassist, and drummer(oh yea!!) Tool is a band that keeps reinventing the music. There albums are not better than any of there other albums just simply equal, fresh, and unique.  I really have to keep myself from falling over when I read a review that is less than stellar.  How anyone could even compare a band of 4 intellectual geniuses to e.g. (korn?, limp bizkit?, linkin park?, sepultura?, slipknot!!??) is simply outrageous and makes me and the rest of the world want to puke!! All of these bands all want to sound like TOOL but I hate to tell you they all fail miserably. All you people with these negative reviews are just upset because you all know deep down that TOOL is the best and will put your band to shame musically and any other way they can!! You just can't mess with the masters of rock.  It's ok we all understand. Let's take a moment and look at this website and some stats.  Not to many albums get almost 1,000 reviews with an average review of 4 1/2 stars. Peace!! It's time again to listen to some MUSIC not CRAP!!
6302860253|5.0|My wife (born a few blocks from Carmen's tobacco factory in Sevilla, Spain) and I agree with most of the 4+ star reviews about this movie-opera.  Leonard Maltin's review is a disappointing non-filmization of the Bizet opera. He is overbaked and unbelievably full of himself.
0446608955|5.0|I saw the movie first, I loved it so much that I had to see it again (I loved it even more the second time)!  I went out and bought the book and finished it the same day.  I read reviews from other readers that they cried while reading this book... I thought, nah, I won't cry.  But in the last few chapters I started to cry... I couldn't help myself.  The funny thing is... after reading the book and seeing the movie, it really made me think.  I actually sat back and re-evaluated my life, and not only spiritually but how we treat people (I think I treat others pretty well, but it's nothing compared to Jamie Sullivan).  <br />This book and movie touched me in many ways.  I highly recommend this book... and the movie! =)
B00005JKES|4.0|A terrific DVD, such as it is, but with the glaring omission of the Pilot episode. Be forewarned: DVD starts with first episode of the &quot;regular&quot; season, AFTER the pilot. This will be a shock and a disappointment for those not expecting it!  Would be 5-stars otherwise.
B000000WFZ|5.0|It's been over 15 years since I first heard the music from The Mission, and I'm still waiting for another soundtrack to come even close to its beauty. The music reflects every emotion of the movie:  from rage, fear, and revenge, to redemption and relaxation.  (But even if you haven't seen the film, you can enjoy every song on the soundtrack.)  Songs such as &quot;Falls&quot; and &quot;Gabriel's Oboe&quot; will astound you.  You've heard some of this music before:  in trailers to other movies, and in commericals.  I think it's a travesty that Ennio Morricone's score did NOT win the Academy Award.
0671027344|5.0|A very unique reading experience.<br />Charlie, the protagonist in this novel, is a very intelligent, very naive high school freshman.  Intelligent and naïve is not a combination that matches a lot of high school cliques and Charlie is in fact severely limited in the popularity department-even thinking of himself as a `wallflower\\".<br />Charlie's story is told via a series of rather long letters to an unidentified friend-it's not clear if these are actually letters ever sent to anyone-that are open, honest, angst filled tales of what life in high school and home is like for Charlie.<br />This is a truly unique story told in a truly unique manner. Usually I loath the \\"letter\\" format of fiction, but in this case the letter format works-mainly because the letters essentially are chapter in fact.  Charlie comes through as a real person-the letters are the sort of philosophical rambling juxtaposed with mundane detail that so characterize teen thinking patterns.  Moreover, the story seems realistic-normal teen experiences with nothing overly dramatic or outlandish-till the very end, anyway.<br />A lot of people apparently don't like the twist at the end-I thought it fit in well.  It's clear almost from the onset something's up-Charlie is obviously trying to deal with something, it's just never clear what it is.  Finding out is a revelation that I think provides a quite fitting ending.<br />An exceptional effort-I'm really looking forward to more from Chbosky.
0780020685|5.0|This epic adventure is the back bone of many modern themes (Magificent Seven and others). A long movie that really don't seem to mind, this movie is one of the best foriegn films ever produced. Hats off to the Toho Corporation for this masterpiece. This is a must have title for any collection and having it on DVD ensures that it will won't wear out before many more generations can enjoy this movie. It seems a little hard to believe that the company that produced Godzilla started out with this movie.
0330289764|5.0|This may be the most unusual book I've ever read.<br />Sort of a philosophical treatise on art, writing, Flaubert, the French, compulsion and love presented under the guise of a very arcane literary detective story.<br />Barnes is a very quixotic and imaginative writer with a definitely skewed view of the world and an engaging and witty writing voice.  The musings of the narrator are well formed and allow the reader move along at a brisk pace. It helps that Flaubert himself was a wacky and iconoclastic figure-one of those people we've all heard of but don't really know anything about unless you are some sort of 19th century French literature freak.<br />This was the first Barnes novel I read and it was so good I have been slowly working my way through his other books, which has proven to be an altogether delightful experience.  All of his novels are good-this one stands out from the pack.
078324228X|1.0|This movie was boring, disheartening, spineless and basically just all around insipid. In fact, it is the first DVD that I will be returning. It was that unbelievably godawful. Bone Collector was pretentious, Remember the Titans was very clich, marginally interesting. But The Hurricane was way below average in terms of the story line, the message it attempted to impart, the cross-section of humanity it tried to portray, and basic overall movie-going satisfaction. The movie was poorly written and the characters seemed like they were something out of a children's book, because they had about the same level of complexity and interest. The acting was OK, but certainly nothing Oscar-worthy. Denzel's movie roles of late have been much ado about nothing, and his performance in The Hurricane is highly overrated. He gets one more try.
B00005R24G|5.0|For those of you who have been disappointed by the version of Sleuth in the white box, take heart and trade up to the black one.  The film is widescreen, entirely presented on one side, and the sound is excellent.  In addition, the DVD includes an interview with playwright Andrew Shaffer about the conception, original staging and film adaptation of \\"Sleuth.\\"  If you haven't already seen this most brilliant of screen thrillers, please kill yourself now.
B00003CXXO|3.0|Essentially, A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE is a short film stretched out into a feature. The first segment which introduces the artificially created boy would have made an excellent episode for the \\"Twilight Zone\\" or \\"The Outer Limits.\\" Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not leave well enough alone. Instead, they drag the film out into a series of seemingly endless subplots and twists.<br />In the last reel or so, the film rolls off a series of endings which mostly fail to generate the emotional impact that is Spielberg's trademark. Some semblance of a theme survives, but its impact is weakened by the film's lack of urgency. The theme is also not brought out in the most compelling way. If you have any interest in seeing this film, watch only the first thirty or forty minutes. It goes steadily downhill from that point on. A major disappointment.

B00005M08C|5.0|I was honestly surprised at how many people don't like Gorillaz (It's just Gorillaz, not THE Gorillaz, get it right...) They obvoously can't appreciate the utter originality of this WHOLE album. Every song is different and more and more brilliant. Great beats and lyrics. I'm not even a rap or &quot;hip hop&quot; fan. I bought this CD because i heard one song on it and it's the best purchase I could have made. Worth every penny!
B0000025T6|5.0|Until the release of his album \\"Nebraska\\" in 1982, virtually all of Bruce Springsteen's material had comprised of big rock band arrangements, rebellious yet poetic anthems which you could carelessly blare from the car stereo. This is shown in The Boss's previous three hit albums \\"Born to Run\\" (1975), \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" (1978), and \\"The River\\" (1980). All of which were soaring rock and roll testaments, that still maintained brilliant meanings, lyrics, and purposes.<br />But in 1982, Springsteen's rock and roll poet image was peeled away with the release of \\"Nebraska,\\" a harrowing set which depicted real life, not always at its most careless state.<br />Recorded at The Boss's home onto a four-track cassette recorder, \\"Nebraska\\" is undoubtedly his most bare and gloomy work, yet even more, his most awe-inspiring, captivating, and poetic. No E Street Band, just Springsteen, his acoustic guitar, a harmonica, and ten hard-hitting stories to share.<br />Fans and critics alike were literally stunned at its separation from his previous electrically charged material. While \\"Nebraska\\" has never been as popular as Springsteen's next album, the phenomenally succesful \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", it is nonetheless deeply recognized for its raw atmosphere and a heartfelt performance from The Boss.<br />The characters in \\"Nebraska\\" are wanderers, all trying to find some light at the end of their tunnels. They all carry some burden on their shoulders, of loss, despair, or of the regret for some sin which has stained their souls. For instance the song 'State Trooper,' the narrative of a man driving along an empty highway at night, something to hide, plagued by the constant fear of being pulled over by a state trooper. 'Atlantic City' (the album's only recognizable single) captures the despair and willpower of a man caught in the dangerous excitement of the early 80's gambling craze in New Jersey. The title cut narrates the late fifties' murder spree of Charles Starkweather and Caril Fugate, depicting the \\"meanness in this world.\\" But perhaps the album's most powerful, touching piece is 'Highway Patrolman', the story of a police officer in a high-speed pursuit with a fleeing criminal...his brother.<br />The climax of \\"Nebraska\\" comes with 'Reason to Believe,' which has several characters of its own, all bruised by some devastating event in their lives, but still they all find some reason to live on.<br />If one looks closely, \\"Nebraska\\" is not that different from its predecessors (in a lyrical sense); the stories it tells all depict life as a battle amongst ourselves, yet there is always some light to find. \\"Nebraska\\" is yet another masterpiece in Springsteen's anthology.Fugate, depicting the \\"meanness in this world.\\" But perhaps the album's most powerful, touching piece is 'Highway Patrolman', the story of a police officer in a high-speed pursuit with a fleeing criminal...his brother. <BR>The climax of \\"Nebraska\\" comes with 'Reason to Believe,' which has several characters of its own, all bruised by some devastating event in their lives, but still they all find some reason to live on.<BR>If one looks closely, \\"Nebraska\\" is not that different from its predecessors (in a lyrical sense); the stories it tells all depict life as a battle amongst ourselves, yet there is always some light to find. \\"Nebraska\\" is yet another masterpiece in Springsteen's anthology.
B000001DTM|5.0|This album is U2's first of the 1990's and one of their best. Joshua Tree being the other best.<br />They enter into the new decade with a different sound that makes their fans and many nonfans just starting to appeal to them, want even more.<br />I love every song on this album.  While &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; are the major hits from this album that got the most airplay, I think &quot;Trying..&quot; and &quot;SO Cruel&quot; are my personal faves.<br />I listened to this album for two weeks straight when I got it..I was covering night shift at my work..this kept me awake..as I loved listening to it so much..<br />HIGHLY recommend for all fans of music because this is just sheer brilliance.
B000002KZ6|5.0|From their formation among New York's punk/new wave/alternative scene in 1976, until the time of their breakup in 1992, the Talking Heads were one of the most brilliant, critically acclaimed &quot;intellectual bands&quot; of all time. Among their eight highly praised studio albums, and their various singles, the Talking Heads were regarded as &quot;art rock,&quot; a term which came from their powerful, exhilirating artistic imagery...and the fact that three of the members (Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, and David Byrne) were graduates from a Rhode Island art school. Though some of the band members have since disregarded the term, it has stuck, and deservedly so. The Talking Heads' music can be described as one thing only: art in its most beautiful forms.<br />It remains a difficult task to select any one album from the Talking Heads' catologue to signify their musical and artistic zenith. But when a choice must be made, 1983's &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; is a stand out contestant.<br />&quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; was recorded after all four members had ventured with some sort of solo project, one of the reasons for the album's excellency; it allowed all four personalities to better shine without a weakening hesitancy...yet still keeping a group feel of equality, no long solos for a particular instrument.<br />Next, this was the first Talking Heads album in about five years without famous producer/collaborator Brian Eno. According to vocalist and guitarist David Byrne, &quot;...the others and I sensed him wanting us to be his backup band...&quot; Without the so-called 'meddling' of Eno, the group vented their ideas more freely, a key element in making great music, as shown in this album.<br />Experimentation also played a role in the poignancy of &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;...if it can be called experimentation; by 1983, the band was following standards of mainstream pop music. With this, a sound escaped from the band that had never been heard before...previously, almost all of their material had sounded extremely different from anything else on the radio at that time. But now, with this newfound blend of pop, the music of the Talking Heads was allowed to 'go new places.' Only here, experimentation actually works.<br />Each song on &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; incites a different feeling; 'Burning Down the House' (named for the chant of &quot;Burn down the house&quot; at Parliament-Funkadelic concerts) ignites a spark in everyone who hears it. Of energy, of excitement, of joy.<br />'Girlfriend is Better' stirs up a sense of wonder, with a hint of sorrow, while leading the listener to believe there is something to be discovered. And one of the most striking pieces on the album, 'This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)', possesses a gravitational force all its own, made up of the naively melodic beat of the music and Byrne's desperate and beautiful vocals. Irony works.<br />Though the Talking Heads cannot be praised for one sole accomplishment, as with all bands there is a zenith somewhere. And though it remains true that this band's lexicon is one of mystery, &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; is a great place to start looking for that climax of talent.almost all of their material had sounded extremely different from anything else on the radio at that time.

B00000064G|5.0|Hearing Nick Drake for the first time was quite a revelation.  The guitar playing was so intriguing and...different.  And his voice really caught my attention.  This disc is awesome-I would say as perfect as an acoustic folk album can be.  &quot;Place to be&quot; and &quot;Which will&quot; are especially powerful.  No frills on this disc, just a man and a guitar.  There is an atmosphere of sadness that pervades this disc, it's great to put on when you have a lot on your mind.  It helps me slow down.  Essential.
0375507507|3.0|This very well written book appears to have been issued by a publisher who doesn't understand publishing. This book could have become a classic, but it will sink from view because of its unmemorable, difficult to pronounce title. The poor cover also suggests that this publisher doesn't know how to market books. Writers getting published for the first time seem to have no idea how important it is to choose a publisher who knows what it's doing.
0440178002|5.0|I read Shogun in ninth grade...in a week - through classes, church, etc. I grew up without a TV and I had a voracious appetite for books and I remember (it was fifteen years ago) that this was the best book that I had ever read. I just finished it again, and it still is. It's one of those pageburner books where you finish the last page and want to start over... on to Tai-Pan.
B00000BKDX|5.0|To me, this album has special meaning, as it was the first metal album I ever bought - it was back in 1986, the month that \\"Master of Puppets\\" was released, and I was [drawn] into several years of heavy metal addiction when I was only 13...!<br />Sound, performance and songwriting on this album are really awesome - Iron Maiden until 1986 (including \\"Somewhere in Time\\", excluding \\"7th Son of a 7th Son\\") are probably the most CLASSICAL act in Heavy Metal, the one that can't be missed. Since then, the band has continued to expire their creative energy, relying heavily on recycling ideas from ten years ago although the ones from twenty years ago were far superior. Sometimes I think they should listen to their old albums from time to time just to see how imaginative they were then and how many brilliant songwriting tricks they never used again...!<br />And here is a suggestion to EMI: It is a great idea to include the beautiful Hammersmith Odeon tracks, which were always missing on the CD version. However, the climax of their concerts on the \\"World Slavery Tour\\" (and the last of several sets of encores) was \\"Sanctuary\\". A live version from this tour was published on the B-side of the \\"Running Free\\" single and is probably the band's most powerful and frenetic live recording EVER (possibly, of ANY other band as well). So, wouldn't it be great to include this amazing piece as a final song?
B00003CXDZ|1.0|This vile piece of schlock brings new meaning to the phrase \\"Please, make it stop!\\" Its vapid, mundane, cliched plot makes me want to retch. The acting was inferior to that of Mrs. Johnson's kindergarten class' production of \\"Gary the Bravest Tooth\\". There are plot holes you could ride a big glowing elephant through, and the only entertaining moment occurs when Nicole Kidman's two-dimensional, unholy character dies to the relief of the audience who by that point is embarrassed to have paid perfectly good money to watch that wretched drivel.
B00005Y23E|5.0|Legend~Deluxe is the last in a serie of 3 Deluxe editions Island has issued. So  this also would be a 2CD set compilation, after  Catch a fire and Exodus...<BR>The package is nice but I still do think they didn't choose the right size of Marley's most famous picture! Too big, which results that you don't see the whole picture compared with the original CD/LP cover! <BR>CD 1 includes all those tracks which has been originally issued on the tape/casette version of the legend in 1984... this casette was released including the tracks EASY SKANKING and PUNKY REGGAE PARTY. <BR>So in fact not really bonus tracks on this LEGEND DELUXE.. just complete (Punky Reggae Party - Long Version)<BR>For the real Marley fans, like I am :o) CD2 is much more interesting! If I am honest, I was waiting for this copilation!<BR>The first time I heard a song of Bob was around the 80's...<BR>So when they originally released the album Legend in 1984.., I also bought all the 12\\" Maxi-Singles they released at that time!<br />Totally 5 issues >> One Love (#1)(remixed by Julian Mendelsohn),<BR>One Love (#2) (Remixed by Godwin Logie), Waiting In Vain, Three Little Birds, Could You Be Loved (Or in several other countries Jamming)<BR>I have great memories to all of the remixes which were included on these great 12\\" singles released in '84! I don't understand why Island records didn't show pictures of all the covers of these! The covers are so beautifull, great photos! Each of them!<BR>To leave the original 12\\" B-side of Wating In vain is a shame!<BR>It is the famous MARLEY MIX UP mixed by CHAD JACKSON, a medley of 4 Marley tracks... kicking of by a part of the radio advert. they included on Exodus Deluxe. I am sure the Marley Maniacs would miss it as well like I do! <BR>But thank God I do own the original Maxi-Singles :o) !!!!!<BR>Including Lively Up Yourself wouldn't be my choise at all! <BR>Only because of Eric ET Thorngren remixed it also around 1984?<BR>OK, never been released before... but it would find a better place on the Remaster version of Natty Dread!<BR>Buffalo Soldier (A kind of KING SPORTY MIX? ....), Jamming, and Waiting In Vain were released before.. on the original US version. But why did they mixed the Legend on this way???<BR>Again remixed by Eric ET Thorngren, but 2 of these tracks lost Marley's message totally I think! Too much drumbox effects which were really not necessarily! <BR>But I still think Finally all these great '84 remixes on CD! <BR>Just Enjoy It!<br />Niels Koopman >>> The Netherlands <<<

B00005UEAR|3.0|The eternal question: &quot;if a tree fell in the forest and there was no one present, would it make a sound?&quot; The same could be asked of all you rabid Dream Theater fanatics; &quot;if Dream Theater released a mediocre CD, would fans realize it?&quot; I propose this question at the risk of sounding anti Dream Theater or anti prog rock. I love Dream Theater and I love prog rock even more. I guess music fans reaction to a new album really has not changed since Yes' &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans.&quot; When that weak double album was first released, I'm sure hardcore Yes fans went orgasmic over it (though it did cause Rick Wakeman to announce &quot;enough's enough!&quot; and quit the band). <br />This CD is okay. It does have some nice moments and soon as they began to develop (as the previous reviewer pointed out), they abandon it. Though I do applaud them for putting their lower extremities out on the line instead of playing it safe living in retched MTV/VH1 land. <br />But I guess it's all worth it. After all, we Zappa fans had to tolerate Zappa's sometimes-silly lyrics before we got a Hot Rats or a Grand Wazoo.
B00005QW4K|5.0|First of all, I think it's really stupid that Anchor Bay made Sam Raimi change the name from MediEvil Dead to Army of Darkness. Why they didn't want to link this movie with the Evil Dead series is beyond me. I understand that they wanted it to be more of a comedy-fantasy but the name-change was a mistake. Also, I think the original ending was MUCH more characteristic for Ash because well - he IS a screw-up. Anyway I'm glad the movie became popular enough for them to be able to release this bootleg of the original. The commentary is even different and better than the other DVD commentary.
0452270073|5.0|I have just finished &quot;Regeneration&quot; found the experience shattering. While Pat Barker misses some of the aspects/issues involved in masculinity or &quot;being a man,&quot; her insights on the ambiguities and ambivalences are sensitive and valuable. Her understanding of the demands and effects of combat contribute to the themes and plot of this novel.<br />The First World War was the seminal catastrophe of the 20th century [not my phrase].  Pat Barker has tried to explore some of reasons why the previous sentence is true.  Class differences and conflicts, the emerging important roles of women in society, the rise of psychological therapy, the incredible ambiguities regarding wartime male relationships and homosexuality are all part of her narrative and the world within the book covers. In no way can these matters be handled broadly or in depth in a tale of 250+ pages but that she can weave them all in with superb writing is testament to an excellent novelist.
B00005QATY|5.0|The movie was GREAT!!!  I loved it and not just because it was filmed in my town.  All the Bluegrass music and especially, \\"Man of constant sorrow\\" was terrific.  I loved the true life reference of Tommy Johnsons selling his soul to the Devil, fantastic.
B00005JKJA|4.0|First of all, please dont see this film and expect to find a plot,lovable characters and a Hollywood ending. This is David Lynch territory and most of the viewers will be extremly confused [I sure was!] yet what you SHOULD expect is nasty characters, plot twists by the barrel-full...<br />The movie begins with our heroine [Laura Harring] complaining to her limo driver about stopping on a deserted road called Mulholland Dr. He threatens to shoot her yet the car is tossed from the road by joy riders and our heroine stumbles out of the crash, un-hurt yet confused...SHE HAS AMNESIA! She sleeps in a house belonging to the Aunt of perky stardome hopeful Betty [Naomi Watts]. Betty and \\"Rita\\" go on a search to find out her real identity and become mixed up in the shenanigans of a Hollywood film director Adam Kesher [Justin Theroux] and the hot shot producers urging him to find a replacement lead actress after his lead actress mysteriously disappears...<br />Where this movie lacks in plot, it makes up for in great performances. The REAL star of the show is Naomi Watts who perfectly captures Betty's innocence and ambition. Laura Harring and Justin Theroux also do great work yet they are acted off the screen by Naomi. I have never before seen a David Lynch film yet after seeing this, I have a sudden urge to rent Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks. This showcases all the weird delights of Hollywood film making!<BR>4 out of 5

B00005QW5X|5.0|Many people have compared this movie to Rocky Horror Pciture Show, and there is already evidence that it's on its way to achieving similar cult status. (For example, when it was a stage show there was one woman who had gone to see it 400 times.) At any rate, I don't think we have to compare Hedwig to anything to appreciate it. Normally I can't stand musicals, but this one has some awesome tunes by Stephen Trask, one of the most gifted songwriters to come along in ages, It's a shame Hedwig and the Angry Inch aren't a real band because any one tune on the soundtrack is better than any given handful of songs on modern rock radio. Trask takes us back to the good old glam rock of David Bowie; it's amazing how faithfully he recreates that style of music. Aside from the rock you have some good old stand up comic-type humor, not to mention the betrayed love of Hedwig and Tommy....This is one of those movies that will always seem new no matter how many times you watch it. You'll be humming the tunes in no time. This is what ALL musicals should be like...powerful, funny, and rockin'!!!

080013558X|5.0|I LOVE this version of Annie! It's AWESOME! I don't know why so many people hate it when this movie is clearly better than the one Disney put out in 1999. The cast is better, the songs are better, and the sets are more realistic. <BR>I really don't see the comparison between the two movies. The sets, like the mansion and the orphanage, are much more realistic in this version than the other one. The orphanage is a dump in this one, which is what it's supposed to look like. The mansion is gorgeous, which it is supposed to look like. The cast is so much better in this one, too. Albert Finney plays a much more realistic Daddy Warbuckst than Victor Garber. I love Aileen Quinn as Annie. She fits the description perfectly: 20% tough, 80% charm. Aileen Quinn looks more like Annie than Alicia Morton,too. Where are Alicia's curly locks? They don't appear until the end. Carol Burnett is a much better Ms. Hannigan than Kathy Bates. She does a much better job in the song \\"Little Girls.\\" Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Geoffrey Holder as Punjab, Edward Herrman as FDR, Tim Curry as Rooster, and Bernadette Peters as Lily are awesome, too.

0385491026|3.0|&quot;Cat's Eye&quot; was a good example of the cruelties that little girls face during their childhood. Elaine, the main character, goes through the first eight years of her life acting like a boy, because she has a brother, and that is the only way she knows how to act. When her parents move to Toronto, she is faced with having to make friends that are girls. Elaine finds some cruel friends that criticize her every move. She is punished in obscene ways like being put down in a hole in the ground and covered with dirt for hours. Her &quot;friends&quot; make Elaine feel that they are &quot;helping&quot; her, and that it is a little girl's game that adults don't know about. When Elaine finds out that the adults were ok with it, she learns to hate. While playing a game of marble's, Elaine wins a cat's eye marble and she honestly believes that it will keep her safe from the girls. As you read the book, you will see how the girls in her childhood affected how she lived the rest of her life. The book was a little confusing, and hard to follow, since Atwood goes back and forth between the past and the present. Overall I would say that &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; isn't a GREAT book, but it isn't bad either.

0061040967|5.0|This is an awesome novel from the creator of the strange-yet-familar world of Discworld. This series includes over 20 novels, and each book can pretty much stand alone. This book is special because it's wonderfully illustrated by Paul Kirby. His illustrations glorifies the story, rather than distract or attempt to replace the story.<br />Discworld is a flat, round world flying through the cosmos on the back of four elephants standing on the back of a space turtle. It's lands and countries are as rich and varied as it's people and, uh, other beings. And, yet, familiar. Using satire, realism, parody, humor, and the right touch of wisdom and thoughtfulness, Prachett delightfully entertains. Some novels focus on the Anhk-Morpork City Watch, trying to solve crimes<br />in a city-state where crime is organized into legally recognized guilds. Some novels focus on Death (the most known anthropomorphic representation, and everybody gets to meet him... eventually) and his granddaughter Susan. Some novels focus on the Ramtops, a high mountain region watched over by a trio of witches, the head of which, Granny Weatherwax, is the most powerful witch of all because she rarely needs to<br />use magic. And many focus on the \\"wizzard\\" Rincewind, a wizard with such little power it goes into the negative, who is always running for his life.<br />\\"The Last Hero\\" is about the last(?) adventure of Cohen the Barbarian, one of the oldest heroes in the disc. He has survived to be very old in the most dangerous profession. With the Silver Horde, a group of similarly aged and skilled warriors, they seek to give fire back to the gods. Fire, that is, in the form of a huge explosion to destroy them. Lord Ventari, leader of Anhk-Morpork, finds out about his plans and also that this explosion would mean not only the end of the gods but the end of the whole Discworld. He sends to stop them Leonard de Quirm, an insanely intelligent inventor and painter with a habit of writing backwards; Carrot Ironfounderson, a six-foot tall adopted dwarf, a captain in the city watch, who may be the heir to the long unused throne of post-regal Anhk-Morpork; and Rincewind, now unpaid Chair of Cruel and Unusual Geography at Unseen University.<br />Very cool, very funny, very good read, with the extra plus of beautifully rendered illustrations that make the tale even more vibrant!ounderson, a six-foot tall adopted dwarf, a captain in the city watch, who may be the heir to the long unused throne of post-regal Anhk-Morpork; and Rincewind, now unpaid Chair of Cruel and Unusual Geography at Unseen University.<br />Very cool, very funny, very good read, with the extra plus of beautifully rendered illustrations that make the tale even more vibrant!
B0000004V2|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can play from beginning to end and it all flows and sounds great.  Staring with the melodic and somber I Wanna be Adored and ending with the epic Fools Gold - the listener becomes enraptured in these beautiful melodies and lyrics.  <br />You simply can't go wrong with this album.  Buy it.
B000003BEV|3.0|Not just a collection of tunes (whether good or bad), TSMR is an &quot;album&quot;.   A forgotten gem amid the high quality Stones catalog.  <br />There is more to this album than &quot;2000 Light Years...&quot; and &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot;.  What about &quot;The Lantern&quot; and &quot;2000 Man&quot;!?  You can actually hear on Beggar's Banquet some influences from &quot;2000 Man&quot;.  It's got a classic tempo (beat? rhythm?), and Kiss also did a remake of the song to boot.<br />&quot;The Lantern&quot;, like &quot;In Another Land&quot; is dreamy, druggy and a subtly catchy tune with repeated listens.  And &quot;Citadel&quot; is a classic Stones Riff-horse in a flower-power disguise.<br />Overall, is it &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot;?  No.  But it's not as disappointing as &quot;Dirty Work&quot; either.  It is a great album to put on and play at home as it all seems to tie together in a weird sort of cacaphonic way.  Better than most &quot;psychedelia-flavored&quot; corporate pop of the '67-'68 season.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Growing up in the 80's - The Goonies was one of the most incredible movies for me. It captures all of the childhood joy and want of adventure and excitement that a normal day just doesn't bring. This movie, while it is clearly an \\"80's\\" flick, does not appear dated in any way. It still has that spark that gave it life nearly 20 years ago.<br />That said, here's what you get with this DVD and here's why you should buy it today:<br />The movie itself is enough however...<br />The deleted scenes are a lot of fun. We finally get to see the ever-fabled \\"Octopus\\" scene. For years, I would scratch my head when Data said \\"The Octopus was really scary!\\" Huh? What Octopus? Well, he's in this DVD. You also realize why the scene was cut out. Let's just say the animatronics weren't all that great.<br />Those old music videos starring Cyndi Lauper and various classic WWF wrestlers are here too. Remember Rock \\"n\\" Wrestling? I found myself saying \\"oh yeah....I remember that!\\" Watch for a cameo of Susanna Hoffs from the Bangles in the video! <br />The DVD commentary is a lot of fun! While almost every new DVD has a commentary in place, it almost always bores one to tears with the director or a star just kind of droning their way through the movie. Often, the major stars don't even do the commentary (great example is Rocky - where the commentary features everyone but Stallone himself!) This commentary has all of the original Goonie stars plus Richard Donner. There's a lot of joking around and the stories they tell are funny and don't go off the subject. Note: Sean Astin disappears about halfway through the flick. Also, beware Corey Feldman who talk over everyone to further perpetuate that he is the biggest glory hog in show business.<br />Enough already. This is such a great movie and the special features are ones that you'll actually watch more than once! Buy the DVD already!
B00005R87Q|5.0|must be the type of people that find soap's fun...Duh! This is the best movie about racing EVER!! If you dont like cars,speed and girls then dont watch....if you do then this is the best movie you will ever see.
B00005RYKV|4.0|Takeshi knows his crime drama and this film, while not as thoughtful as Fireworks, is stunning.  If you enjoy a different style of pacing and characters with character then his movies are up your alley.  Violent and then peaceful, Brother is more a work of art than just a yakuza film.
B000000H5K|5.0|Damn, this album kicks you in the teeth from the beginning and only pauses twice briefly before it's over.  <br />I had reservations about buying this album at first. I'm not a huge metal fan and I knew Sepultura was an 80's death metal band.  I just read so many reviews sayig how great it was I really couldn't resist. WOW<br />I normally enjoy more mellodic or clean vocals but Max has got a set of lungs on him.  I don't think I've ever heard a roar as deep as his especially right out of the gate(\\"Roots, Bloody Roots\\").<br />This album follows no formula whatsoever and each song takes on a life of its own.  There a two lighter tracks, a really great acoustic guitar solo and a song with the band playing acoustic and a tribe chanting and singing.  That one is pretty impressive.<br />Others favorites include the crazy \\"Ratamahatta\\".  This song jumped out at me and has remained my favorite song on the album since I got it.  <br />Masterful percussion throuhgout the entire album.  The guitar playing is cool because some of the songs take on a traditional death metal grind but others have the downtuned sound of early nu-metal(let's say Korn but incredibly heavier).  This counts alot to the originality and diversity of the album.<br />Anyway, go out and buy it if you like good music.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed Pearl Harbor.  It was a true story of two friends that fought in World War II and the girl they both loved.  It not only demonstrated how America was &quot;sleeping&quot; when we were attacked, but how many of our soldiers lost their lives needlessly.  We highly recommend the movie to those who have compassion for our servicemen who fought for America's freedom.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album whisks me away to somewhere I don't know but love, especially &quot;Airbag&quot;.  Don't know why that song's my fav but it is.  This is one of those albums that comes along rarely and refuses to ever go away.  If you enjoy intelligent music and don't have this album you should be ashamed of yourself.  In the top ten of the 90's.
6305949980|5.0|This DVD was phenominal! Great bonus features(deleted scenes, behind the scenes, image gallery, audio commentary, trailers and posters; THE WHOLE ENCHALADA!) It also has two of Burton's short films, Frankenweenie(the uncut version) and vincent(Burton's directorial debut) both previously unreleased! And the main course, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is so inventive and unique, it has yet to be upstaged! IT ROCKS!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|chunks is my dog. this movie was soo awful. if you can believe it, it was barely worth seeing a glimpse of Jolie naked from the back! I like awesome special effects, choreographed action scenes, slo-mos, and cool babes. but this is really not worth it. before i saw, i thought that there was no way it could be horrible- not good maybe, but not horrible. It was.
B00005UEAR|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  This album is great, and lives up to many of the expectations one would have about DT.  However, there are some moments in this album that are classic, and some that just... really really stink.  A few cheesy moments during great songs that just make them practically unlistenable.  However, I think it's great to see a band branch out to new territory and experiment with new influences.  Some of these experiments succeed magnificently, some divebomb to six degrees of shame.  Here's a little overview:<BR>The Glass Prison:  Excellent opening, leading in with the same record static from their previous album, Scenes.  This song is great for the first 5 minutes... makes you want to mosh right there.  The second part is excruciatingly cheesy at points; their quasi-death-metal sound is good for a little while, but then John and Mike trade off with James in vocals that compel me to skip to the next track.  If you can survive that part, the rest of the song is great.<BR>Blind Faith:  I heard a 5/6 minute edit of this that was wonderful.  Simple sounding, almost reminiscent of \\"Innocence Faded,\\" and some FII. Radio friendly, but still very DT.  However, 10 minutes of this song is... well, excessive.  We get the point by minute 4.  The opening sounds like they'd been listening to Radiohead's Amnesiac beforehand.<BR>Misunderstood:  Perhaps the only song on the album I wouldn't change in any way.  It kicks into high-gear at the perfect time.  The outtro is great, where it just sorta fades into noise and out again, then it cuts off.  The guitar noise made me think \\"Mr Self Destruct!\\" right off.<BR>Great Debate:  Wonderful song except one thing... ditch the news reports!  They completely date the song, and now it's old before it even starts.  The lyrics themselves are dated, but it wouldn't be nearly as bad if you didn't have those recordings.  Other than that, good job.<BR>Disappear:  Great ballad in 5.  I like Jordan's vibrato piano work.  Good way to wrap updisc one.<BR>CD2 gets the same response from me as Scenes did.  I didn't like Scenes till I saw it live, now I love it.  I think 6 Degrees is going to need the same treatment before I can really listen to it.  All in all, I think it's great that the band is taking in outside influences and utilizing them.  It's not always cohesive and only hits the mark about half the time, but with a little refinement, DT will definitely get places in their evolution as a band.  Keep on dabbling!
6303942830|5.0|Visionary direction, wonderful performances from a skilled cast, lush musical score, and spectacular location filming all combine for a visually stunning, and emotionally moving film.  One of the best of any genre.  Highest possible recommendation.
B00004XONN|5.0|I realize not all of this stuff is original in concept or a big display of talent.  But Radiohead has never been one to show off how talented they are.  This is an album that requires an emotional or spiritual connection in order to really like it.  Some people don't get that connection, and the album stinks... justifiably so.  It's definitely not something you'd play at a party (unless everyone was on acid), and if you don't really get on a personal level, it just drags on and on and on and on... However, I am one of those who connects very deeply with the emotions on this album.  To the point where I don't even listen to it for music or for the band, but to just feel the sounds.  It's meditative, and some parts will just move you to tears (the strings on How to Disappear).  Treefingers, of which I see a lot of bad reviews for here, even connects with me.  The fact that it comes after How to Disappear makes me think that this is the music that'd play when you actually HAVE disappeared.<BR>All in all, this is an album that just has to click with you, or else it's just a waste of industry.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I think Shrek is a very comic history. I own the DVD ZONE 4, and the games and the DVD-ROM sector was incredible.
B000000OUE|5.0|I like this CD ALOT. It is a kind of a techno-ish heavy metal. The lyrics are indeed explicit as are some of the pics in the little pamphlet thing whatever its called. I like most all of the songs on this CD, so much that I have to listen to it my car when I'm driving. I think the best songs are: Electrichead part 2, More Human than Human, Blood, Milk and Sky, Super-Charger Heaven, Blur the Technicolor, not in that order, but those are my favorite. I don't know if I've forgotten any. Most of them are pretty good if you like this type of music.
B000021Y77|3.0|Run Lola run is a good movie.<BR>Franka Potente looks very good with all that red hair.<BR>She is the best of the film, you can also see it in BLOW and in ANATOMY.<BR>The movie in very interesting and enterteining, it diserves a SEVEN +.
B0000024W3|5.0|I don't know what all the controversy is about - this is a beautiful continuation of the Nashville Skyline direction - I can't figure out what is supposed to be so &quot;bad&quot; about it - a pleasure to listen to.
6305428425|4.0|Lisa Kudrow is my idol.Shes such a great actress.And when she makes her role of Phoebe(from F.R.I.E.N.D.S), i could laugh for hours.<BR>If you listen very carrefully to what they said, you realise that is a very clever movie.<BR>Like:<BR>-You look so grat with blond hair and that black roots, that is not even funny.<BR>-I hope your babies look like monkeys.<BR>-Who lost the virginity first?<BR>Oh big wow! with your cousin Barry, i wouldnt brag about it.<BR>-Excuse me, i cut my foot before, and my shoe is felling up with blood.<BR>-Im the Mary, you are the Rhoda.<BR>And many more.<BR>This is a movie worth to see.<BR>And Mira Sorvino is so beautiful!(But not as Lisa).
B00005RYKU|3.0|There was a missing element in this supposed thriller.  The mystery was all but completely obvious, and even then our heroine, Ruby, goes mainly on suspicion and eavesdropping.  Her sleuthing skills are minimal and I felt the process of discovery was forced, random, and left much to be desired.  A thriller slowly and steadily reveals the predicament the victim is in rather than have it, literally, walk right through the front door.  You basically dislike and suspect the antagonists from the beginning so it's no shock when things start to go downhill.<br />Much of the story is predictable, but the suspense is still exciting.  I wish the back story of the Glass' was developed better.  The culmination of multiple threads at the end is satisfying and creative.<br />My criticism out of the way, the acting was actually very good and the suspense had me on the edge of my seat.  So for pure entertainment value, this was acceptable.   And Leelee is excellent as the moody teenage heroine playing Ruby with the right amount of suspicion, arrogance, and ignorance.
B00005JKHP|5.0|STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE/THE DIRECTOR'S EDITION delivers upon its promise: to make the film look, sound, and feel better than the original version. Robert Wise's Director's Cut delivers. The new and enhanced visual effects and new editing give it a more &quot;exciting&quot; feel, and seeing it in 65mm Widescreen is incredible! And fans will be able to enjoy more than just the movie, with hours of special features that never cease to entertain. Paramount should get on the ball and rerelease STAR TREK II with a two-disc 2OTH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EDITION as soon as possible! Bravos on this one, Paramount! Grade: A+
0380002930|5.0|It took some coaxing, but I finally convinced my 13 year old, a huge Harry Potter fan, that there was greater literature out there for her to explore. We listened to a fine reading of Watership Down over the past month in the car -- and she was transfixed. Indeed, she went from reluctance, to enthusiasm, to downright hostility if I listened to any part of it while she was not in the car. The book is simply beautiful -- filled with religious and political allegory, but also filled with characters you admire and whose company you actually enjoy: Hazel, the courageous leader, Bigwig, the warrior, Fiver, the prophet, Blackberry, the intellectual, Bluebell, the jokester, and Dandelion, the story-teller, to name a few. The adventures detailed are gripping, from escaping from a doomed warren, to fighting for their lives against the totalitarian regime from Efrafa. In between, our rabbit friends encounter cats, dogs, foxes, and man himself, the most destructive creature of all. As all the accolades here attest, this is a book rich not only in excitement and entertainment but also in wisdom and insight. No knock against J.K. Rowling, but Richard Adams fable of courage and survival far surpasses the much touted Harry Potter. Even my 13 year old seems on the verge of conceding this.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I dj for a side job, it is not very often that i come upon an album that I know I can put in and just kick back.  This cd has everything in it and at times is most surprising.  I looked for it for awhile and it was always sold out, finally got it and would be listening to it now if I wasn't typing this.  I have to admit that it is pleasing to all ages, it makes you either want to sing along or jump up and start dancing.  As an entertainer I am constantly buying cd's and using just a track or two off of each one, if everyone out there put out cd's like this..my job would be a lot easier and expenses alot less.
B000002LE6|5.0|This is it: Prince's statement on it all, circa 1986. Perfect, especially 'Glam Slam'. One of his best, completely overlooked or is it? Put it in your player and enjoy. May U live 2 see the dawn, eh?
B000007ODL|5.0|I must confess embarrassingly that although I have known for a long time OF J.J. Cale, I had never gotten around to obtaining any albums.  Well, that's what birthdays are for, to ask for things you normally wouldn't go out and buy.  Since I received this CD, I'm having difficulty listening to anything else. I deeply regret having cheated myself for so many years before becoming educated on this wonderful singer/songwriter.  If you are a fan of Clapton's mid to late-70's albums, and you, like me up until this point, have failed MISERABLY to expose yourself to Cale's music, please, please, please get this album.  It's hard to imagine anything I'm going to enjoy tapping my feet to more than his music, with the added bonus of being able to listen to his great lyrics.  I now understand why he has been called by many as one of the most influential musicians of the last 30 years.  To put it plainly--these songs are just absolute fun to listen to.  Beautiful, laid-back guitar, a dusty voice that fits perfectly with the album cover, subtle and appropriate harmonica licks.  J.J. Cale's music has shot to the front of my favorites of all time in about one week time.<BR>Oh, by the way---DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THERE IS A CURE TO BEING ADDICTED TO AN ALBUM?  I'm not saying I want it at this time, but maybe in a few weeks when this has been the only CD that's been playing in my house and car the whole time, I might want to check into it.  Thanks.
0345451325|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time (if not the best) and I usually dont like to read. The Fall of Reach has a great storyline leading up to the game and it couldnt have been done any better. This book is a must for everyone who owns the game to learn how everything came into place, or is great for anyone that likes science fiction/action. Halo's story is definitly the best I've ever seen in a game and this book makes it allot clearer and better.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This is one of the best new CD's that I have purhased recently. I can't stop listening to it. Pink is a diverse performer and songwriter. She can sing the hell out of the dance tracks, 'Get the Party Started' and 'Respect,' but she can reveal a more personal side, 'Family Portrait' and 'Lonely Girl.' <br />If you haven't had the chance to experience Pink--do. She offers much more substance than her peers Britany Spears, Mandy Moore and the like. Britany has marketed herself. Pink is a talented multi-faceted performer.<br />Remember--THINK PINK.
B000059Z8M|5.0|When I bought the Toy Story 2 DVD for my 2 year old son, I never thought I would actually like it, but now I think I like it more than he does, even though he asks to see it constantly. My favorite part is the Jesse story, with the Sarah McLachlan song in the background, I actually got misty eyed the first time I saw it. This is the best animated movie I have ever seen, period.
078062999X|5.0|How Kenneth Branagh missed an Oscar nod for best actor is beyond the scope of rational intelligence to contemplate.  His performance is stupendous, with a greater range in one movie than most modern &quot;actors&quot; display in an on-screen lifetime.  He is by turns lucid and manic;  subtle and boistrous;  and more than all, sublime.  When the ghost appears in Gertrude's chamber and and Hamlet tries to get her to see it is just one fine example of a perfectly-polished performance:  Branagh is at once comic and tragic, and you can see where his Hamlet, playing mad for the last several hours, questions his own sanity at this moment.  As a director, Branagh tries hard, but they might've thrown him a nomination as a bone.  The film looks great, down to the last detail.  Only a few quibbles:  though many of the star turns are very good (Heston's is a standout, and one of the few stars in the movie to absorb his role effectively so you can look beyond the iconic Heston and see him as part of the movie), others are blatantly grafted on.  When Jack Lemmon, woefully miscast and sounding like he'd never heard of Shakespeare before, says there's something rotten in the state of Denmark, we want to cry, &quot;Yes, your acting!&quot;  But once you get past the first act, which is a bit high-strung (for the groundlings), the film settles into a nicely strolling pace, and you'll believe Shakespeare actually wrote &quot;Hamlet&quot; to be set in a Ruritanian kingdom.  &quot;Hamlet&quot; is an obsession of mine and of all the available Hamlets I've seen -- Olivier, Kline, Burton, even the fiasco with Gibson -- this is the best, probably because Branagh took the time and effort to do the play whole, and in a way that is explicable to even the densest groundlings (Olivier's Hamlet may have had fine performances, but it took such liberties as the removal of Rosencrantz and Gildenstern).  If you loved &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, try the tragic romance of Hamlet and Ophelia on forsize.  The best word for this film is &quot;magestic&quot;.  You don't just watch &quot;Hamlet&quot;, you live it.  And you'll leave it knowing what it was about.
B00003CX5P|5.0|George Lucas is a punk.  He kept saying how he had this movie written and ready to go for years.  Fifteen years after Return of the Jedi he gives us an average Sci-fi flick.  But despite the weak plot, annoying characters, and complete absence of testosterone, this DVD is a must buy...  <br />There are several extended scenes completed just for the DVD, a plethora of promotional material, and reference quality sound, but the crown jewel of this package is the behind the scenes documentary.  Not the typical talking head featurette, the hourlong program features some \\"colorful\\" reactions of the actors and producers to weather and casting.  It also reveals exactly how adamant Lucas was about a creature named Jar Jar.  Hopefully he didn't finish the script for episode 2 over a weekend.
B000000WFF|5.0|No matter what anyone else says, I think that the Spice Girls were a vital part of the music scene in the 1990's.  This album is proof of that.<br />Spice Up Your Life - This song is fun.  It's just fun...you can dance around to it, goof off, etc.  It's just a good, fun song with very lively sounds.<br />Stop - This one has a jazz feel by the horns, but the vocal part is definitely very poplike with the harmonies and lyrics.  Kind of the happy 60's pop vibe.  This one is fun, but not as fun as <br />Spice Up Your Life.  It's more like how a middle school kid might feel about their crush, which was appropriate when I got the cd.<br />Too Much - Softer, more romantic sound.  Very sultry sounds in it, too.<br />Saturday Night - Wonderful harmonies...fun, yet somewhat sultry song.<br />Never Give Up on the Good Times - A silly song with a good message.  Lots of fun, with a frog sound in it.  It kind of has a disco-era type theme to the background part.<br />Move Over - The former Pepsi song!  Hehe...remember when this used to be played on the Pepsi commercials.  LOL!  If you do, then you know part of the gist of the song.  It's fun like that, but that part *from the commercial* is at the very beginning before the song really 'starts'.  Just another fun SG song.<br />Do It - Their harmonies are great in this one.  There is definitely a bit of sassiness in this song...very cool.<br />Denying - This song is really cute and has a good message.<br />Viva Forever - This is my favorite Spice Girls song!  Very mature for them.  It has a beautiful and romantic sound.  The guitar and strings just add the perfect elegance to the song.  The voices are perfect on this song, too.<br />The Lady is a Vamp - Starts off with a flapper/blues type jazz thing.  Very fun.  It continues with the jazz theme and it makes it sound really cool.  Definitely not your everyday pop sound.<br />I think this is quite diverse for an album that some think is 'pure bubblegum pop'.  Sure, some of it is sugary stuff, but there are other non-sugary songs.  Most of the songs, however, are fun.  I think most people would enjoy this, even if they didn't realize that they could enjoy Spice Girls' music.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry was a fairly simply, straightforward book about a boy named Jonas living in a community where sameness is everything.  In fact, it is desired.  He's content with this sameness until he is chosen to become the communities new Reciever in training.  There, the Giver awakens Jonas to the possibility that everything does not have to be the same.  Colors, music, emotions, and pain do in fact exist and are very real.  I liked this book, simply because it was a quick read (Only about 180 pages)and presented the theme that sameness is not ideal.  There is no such thing as the perfect society.  You cannot feel satisfied as a human being by living without love or pain or anger or truth.  The Giver was an excellent novel about trust, awakening, and love.  This book reminded me quite a bit of Aldus Huxley's \\"A Brave New World\\" much in the way that everything in Jonas's community is regulated and controlled with a fear of difference.  A good read for a book report when you don't have much free time.
B00005UM42|5.0|Now this is the copy to purchase, it's from Leisure Entertainment, not to say it couldn't use more digital improvement for an independent but, it's Dolby mixed and in letterbox (1.85:1), not mentioned on the cover. To date, no other copies have these options. What a treat. Brando portrays the same type of brooding character that he portrays in many of his other movies, except this is a western. I love westerns. Malden, in his early career bad guy movie rolls. Did you see Nevada Smith? Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens are scum. Great cast. Get this copy before it goes out of print. It's the best copy you'll find. The cinematography is just beautiful. It takes place in Monterey, CA.
B0000508U6|5.0|This cd is one of those I can listen to over &amp; over. Coldplay has captured the feeling of unrequited love in their song &quot;Shiver&quot; which is my current favorite on this album.  After listening to the entire cd a few times, I find all the songs pleasing -- these guys are quite the artistic musicians as well as poets. They're the kind of band I would love to see in a cozy little pub on a rainy day.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I orignally rated this album low, because it didn't catch me at the time I was listening to it. Well, turns out it's my most played album now. As long as the mood is mellow and not high strung, and you're not trying to entertain friends, this is fantastic music to have playing. Now to me it's as good as Pink Floyd or any 'listening experience' masterpiece.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is not really a review. It's just to tell Americans that Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone (which was changed to Sorcerers Stone for Americans to understand)is coming out 2 weeks before the US in the UK because JK Rowling wants it to and that Harry is British!
B000002H33|5.0|But don't worry. Gem is gem! This is the greatest metal album ever recorded. Since metallica sold out with Black album, this has been their peak. &quot;The thing that should not be&quot; and &quot;Leper messiah&quot; are unsatisfactory songs. But who cares? <BR>You should get this cd. Now!
B00005RYL9|5.0|Allthough I am one of the 'oddly loyal ' fans as described by the editorial above, I am not sure if I will buy this yet, but it does look like a damn fine edition of a film I will allways love.But AS I am in Great Britain,i have made one mistake with importing Highlander movies allready.I got the 'Director cut' imported a year or so ago,only to find It was only the same as what had been released over here allready,and the footage restored was only new to you chaps over here in the US.Still,the commentary track has still not appeared in Great Britain yet.So that was something.But the Immortal edition says uncensored directors cut,so I  am sure it will be worth looking into at least.
0440416027|4.0|This book is VERY interesting and original. Skellig (the character) is an amazing creation, and unlike most fictional creatures you'd be hard pressed to find anything like him in another book. The story itself revolves around finding and learning about the character Skellig, and on the side there is a problem with Michael's (the main character's) baby sister. Even though that doesn't sound like much of a storyline, it actually moves very quickly and holds interest.<br />My only complaint would be the writing style. It has very little description, so little that at times it is easy to lose track of where characters are and what's around them, and it can be difficult to tell who is talking when dialogue appears.<br />But all in all, I would definitely recommend this book.
B000002OX7|5.0|Composed of songs from Pete Townsend's aborted master work Lifehouse, Who's Next is truly one of classic rock's essential albums. The group never sounded better (although Tommy comes awful close), with each member in top form. Roger Daltrey is at his emotional, vocal best, Pete Townsend's guitar and songwriting are top notch, John Entwhitle's bass is as precise as ever, and Keith Moon is flawless on drums as usual. Many of The Who's best and most well known songs are found on this release, which is bookended with two of rock's finest songs. The album begins with the fantastic Baba O' Riley, an FM radio staple and my personal favorite Who track. Ending the album is arguably the greatest rock anthem of all time in Won't Get Fooled Again. Falling in between are hidden gems and well known jingles that showcase the group at their best. Already a great album, the remastered edition with bonus tracks is on another level by itself. This is truly an album for all rock fans and should find a place on everyone's top 10 list.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Bravo!! Bravo!! Finally a CD that I can't stop listening to, it is just so great!!<br />Fiona Appla is a amazing talent. Her two albums are chop full of delcious melodies and haunting lryics. I even like this cd better that her other one Tidal. Because it had some good songs on it but this one sound like she has matured as a singer and songwritter. Even my uncle curtis like this cd and has me make a tape so we could play it in his trans am!! This girl name Rhapsodie sit next to me at school and she look just like Fiona Apples. I asked her once if she like Fiona Apple and she just stare at me like I was asking her out or something. I guess she figure I know that she know that she look like Fiona apple. Mostly in that video for criminal. I want to have a girlfriend but they scare me when they behave in that manner. I am sure Fiona Apple is a nice girl but I dont understand why she behave in the video like that. If I ask out Rhapsodie and she come over to my house will she be sitting on the kitchen counter pulling off her socks and squeezing the dawn bottle making soap bubbles? I would be scared if my uncle came in and saw her there.He wouldnt know what to do. He already yell at my sister for sending love letter to her boyfirends on her pager.  <br />So I think the best songin the world is&quot; Paper Bag.&quot; And this cd is super in every way i love you Fiona!! If i was stuck on an island for a year a would hope I had this cd to listen to!! It is great.
0783226063|5.0|I am a fan of the original books written by Frank Herbert.<br />A 2 hour movie could never hope to capture the detail present in those novels.<br />David Lynch does not attempt it. His Dune looks like a slice of religious instructional propaganda from the year 10 000 A.D. You can't watch this as a version of the book, it almost isn't. It's a peek into the Dune universe and enjoyable in its resulting inscrutability.<br />If you can learn to enjoy movies for something other than straight narrative and character development, then you might enjoy this. leave that stuff to other movies.<br />I still think it sets the pace for visual interpretations of science fiction novels. When I read Dune, I think of the David Lynch movie. The mini-series looked like a campy stage production.

B000059XY3|3.0|The thing that bugs me the most about Batman Forever is that it had the potential to top the two films that came before it, but due to drastic cuts and revisions, the finished product feels woefully incomplete.<br />While Batman Returns is my favorite of all the films, I don't mind the fact that Warner Bros decided to lighten the franchise *slightly* in order to draw in a bigger crowd (then they took this *slightly* and changed it to *drastically* for 'Batman and Robin'). A lot of the changes are rather cool from a visual effects point of view: Gotham might have gone neon and colorful, but it's still the same dangerous urban jungle it always was, complete with gothic statues. I have no problems with Val Kilmer; those who watch the animated series (especially Batman Beyond) know that Wayne was very obsessed and distracted. His portrayal was different from Keaton's, but not necessarily worse. (At least he didn't smile while wearing the bat-suit, like Clooney did.) Carrey as the Riddler was a stroke of casting genius. Yes, it feels like Superman III (where a popular comedian ate up screen-time and was used to draw in more moviegoers) but here, Carrey *works*. His antics take the Riddler to a whole new level, and he adds a lot to the film. Kidman was underused as the love interest, but she does a credible job with her material. O'Donnell establishes his Dick Grayson rather nicely. Unlike the later addition of Batgirl, Robin is actually crucial to the plot, because the death of his parents re-trigger's Wayne's dreams and painful memories.<br />Now for where the film failed. Tommy Lee Jones was good as Two-Face, but after awhile he was sidelined to the status of common thug. In the comics and animated series, Two-Face had a serious personality disorder, none of which is explored here. Two-Face could have carried the entire movie by himself.<br />But more importantly, the film lost a lot of the fine plot details that could have elevated it greatly. Most of these were trimmed out to keep the film to a 2hr running time. The original function of the red diary was that it contained words from Bruce's father that made it seem like Bruce forced them to go to the movies that night (and therefore, was responsible for their deaths.) When a young Bruce reads this, he runs out into the storm, falls into the cave, and meets the giant bat. Later, after the attack on Wayne Manor, Bruce loses his memory. He finds the diary and realizes he read his father's words wrong, therefore erasing his guilt. Bruce then confronts the giant bat again. Later scenes show a hidden level to the batcave where the Batwing, Batboat, and sonar suit are kept, which explains how they escaped the Riddler's rampage. Sounds cool, doesn't it? Well like I said, all this was cut out. Having Batman make peace with his past was a good idea. Instead of hunting criminals out of guilt, he would now do it for justice. Too bad that by cutting out these crucial scenes, the heart, as well as the meaning of 'Batman Forever' was ruined completely.<br />So 'Batman Forever' gets three stars. It's a fun enough romp, but it could have been sooo much more. In fact, I hope WB revisits this title and gives it a special edition treatment complete with all the deleted scenes. Until then, this VHS copy will have to suffice.mmed out to keep the film to a 2hr running time.

0060987464|4.0|Anyone who enjoys something interesting should read this book. I chose it because I wanted to read something completely out of the ordinary in comparison to my own thoughts and beliefs. It's a book that makes the reader think, and helps a person feel a certain appreciation for the things we have in life. It helps us realize how lucky some of us really are growing up as children even though we complain about our parents being so \\"mean\\" and \\"cruel\\". I wouldn't recommend this book to the extremely weak of heart, or stomach for that matter. Nor would I suggest this to someone who is highly religious in their beliefs. I also might throw out the extremely depressed, since I'm not quite sure how they would interpret this reading. I make it sound as if a lot of people should not partake in this autobiography, but those are really just a small part of the population. I think if a person wants a well written, extremely in-depth, and ultimately entertaining novel, then they should consider The Long Hard Road out of Hell. <br />They way the book is set up is rather complex. The story's order is simple, starting with Brian Warner (Marilyn Manson) as a young boy and following his life as grows and experiences. The book follows that pattern nicely, so the reader is never confused as to what time in Warner's life we are in. There are also quotes placed throughout the text. Mainly they are seen before the start of a new chapter. Within the chapters, Warner has inserted what he calls \\"circles\\" which divide up the text. For example a chapter could be broken into three; circle one, circle two and circle three. As we enter Brian's teenage years, he then begins including examples of writings he composed at the time, letters he sent to magazine's along with paper's he had submitted, things like that. He uses them to give the reader more insight into his thoughts, letting us enjoy, or be repulsed by, his works. Approximately halfway through the book, Brian Warner (now calling himself Marilyn Manson) briefly loses the autobiographical format letting us enjoy an interview between him and a magazine reporter. Once this has finished, he then cuts back to the telling of his autobiography. Overall it's really an engaging format, changing the text up periodically and keeping the reader interested, and most importantly, reading. <br />As far as faults or problems this book has, there aren't too many. The language could be a problem for some, along with graphic sexual and violent encounters. Mansons also discusses Satanism a few times, but none of these are really problems with the book, but ultimately with the reader. If you can chew it, then I recommend you swallow it and not miss out on a great literary experience.<br />I picked up this book expecting exactly what I saw on the cover, Marilyn Manson. It made me think and it made me cringe, but it also made me laugh. A very in-depth, well written book, perfect for a man such as Manson. The Long Hard Road out of Hell shouldn't be ignored.
B00003CXCK|5.0|No words can describe now incredible this movie is!  The best Speilberg movie i've ever seen.  It has sensational performances bye Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson.  This movie shows how cruel and brave the human spirit can be.  Get this movie!!!  Some turn their heads and try to forget the holocaust, but this movie proves that we can never forget.
0780021150|5.0|Ok... in my book, you can't miss any film that has the great Peter Lorre in a key role. While this film was most likely intended to make a statement about society, it translates nicely as a finely crafted story of a manhunt for a despicable murderer of children. <br />The Criterion dvd features a very nice print, and considering this is in the early day of sound film, maintains a clean soundtrack. <br />Like the best of post WWI German films, M makes people look at themselves and question the power that leads, or misleads. The gray area is surprisingly broad when presented in such a skilled way. This film merits re-watching as the arguement proposed in M leaves further questions, rather than answers.<br />The sharp editing and stark imagery make the technical execution of this film a classic and paints society itself as ugly as its own nightmares.
B00003CY0V|1.0|This is a truly impressive, brain damaged actioner made all the more unpalatable by John Travolta (who's become a second rate parody of himself) and Halle Berry (who makes Machiavelli seem like a bleeding heart liberal).  The film's only real claim to distinction is the boob deal Berry made with the producers.  Now to be worth even one hundredth of what she allegedly got paid, her 2 greatest assets would have to be the size and symmetry of basketballs---and they aren't.  On the other hand it's not a bad trade for their six seconds of screen time.  I'm sure she needed the extra cash for her highway legal fund.  The rest of the movie is a ludicrous mishmash of bad techno-babble, macho revenge fantasies and relentless random mayhem.  Those elements might make \\"Swordfish\\" seem more interesting that it really is, but there's not much unintentional humor to leaven things out (or intentional humor, for that matter).  What's truly amazing about the mephitic mushroom cloud of bad karma this movie has generated is that it has managed to up the ante in Hollywood's relentless pursuit of the depths of smarm and cynicism.  This is one fish that desperately needs to be wrapped in newspaper and buried by the family cat.
6305078491|1.0|NOTE: The following comments from 2002 pertain to the Image Entertainment DVD.    Carl Dreyer's classic horror film _Vampyr_ is desecrated on a substandard DVD.  The image transfer is nearly unwatchable (as is true of the VHS cassette), with extensive grain and artifacts.  The sound is muffled and garbled, with persistent loud hissing; most of the underscoring and some of the dialogue are lost under the noise.  The English subtitles -- which cannot be turned off -- are large and intrusive.  The only bonus feature on the disc is _The Mascot_, an unrelated short subject by the stop-motion master Starewicz.  (Imagine what would happen if the Brothers Quay were dropped into the 1930s, and you'll have a good idea of Starewicz.)  It's a great short.  Unfortunately, its DVD transfer is even worse than the main feature's.  Dreyer and Starewicz deserve better.  Criterion, where are you?    UPDATE (April 2008): Criterion is releasing a deluxe 2-DVD edition of VAMPYR in July 2008.
B00005U122|3.0|I bought the CD because a very good friend said that if I was such a big PF fan I should see Roger Live to get the whole picture, then I got the DVD as a Gift, and very recently I went to the live show in Mexico City. The DVD is very good, the songs of course are well known by every PF fan (some people have told me that they havent heard before the post  PF era of Waters). It was good watching old Roger singing and playing songs from his PF era, specially since he was the creative force of most songs.<BR>The problem was that something was missing, it was really funny, specially in the concert, it was a very good show, but the songs sounded funny,like something was missing (PF was what was missing)for example snowy white did his best(he is a very good guitar player) but he is no David Gilmoure. What Im trying to get at is that the present PF sound more like the &quot;complete&quot; PF that Roger Waters alone.<BR>Im sory Roger but as much as PF needs you, you need more of them.
0805066691|5.0|I became interested in Native Americans when I was about ten years old, that was fifty years ago, my interest is as strong now as it was then.<br />Thanks to Dee Browns book over the last few years more and more people are becoming aware of the plight of the native american during the period from 1850 to 1890, forty short years that saw the extermination of a whole way of life.<br />Dee Brown has a way of making you feel part of the events that took place in the \\"Civilising\\" of the American west by the white european, the great tragedy is that today it would not be allowed to happen.<br />Treaty after treaty signed by the US Government allowing the native americans land that shall be theirs for as long as the grass shall grow and the rivers run, and broken more often than not by the whites before the ink was dry, and when the red man rebelled he was labeled a savage, where does that remark put Col John Milton Chivington after the slaughter at Sand Creek.<br />I possess a large library of books associated with the native americans and I can honestly say that \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" is, in my opinion, the bible on the subject of  native americans, and I thank the powers that be that Dee Brown had the courage to write this book and bring home to the world the terrible slaughter that took place in 19th century america.
0684823454|5.0|Winston Churchill does a terrific job detailing his life as a young man in his autobiography, &quot;My Early Life&quot;.  What make this such a great book is the way Churchill writes: it is rather informal, as if he is talking directly to you.  Churchill describes certain experiences in his past so vividly it is like they were fresh in his mind from having just happened.  An important feature to this book is that it includes certain incites that cannot be found in any history book.  You can learn much from this book.  It comes from the mind of an experienced British cavalry officer, journalist, and politician.  It is full of stories and special accounts that are never uninteresting.  To read and enjoy this book it is not required to know anything about the man, Winston Churchill.  Anyone from a high school student to a renowned historian will enjoy reading this book.
B000002AZ8|5.0|This CD is a good example of why Pearl Jam is so great. Ten is a great CD, one of the best of the 90's, but if Pearl Jam didn't break away from the \\"Seattle Sound\\" and experiment with new sounds, they would get old and repetitive after a while. All of the greatest musical artists throughout history sound very different towards the end of their carears than at the beginning, Pearl Jam is no different. Listen to Yield, ... and then listen to Ten. Both are great albums, but both sound completely different. Yield sounds like more of an alternative release than grunge, but I think it's excellent. The reason Vitalogy is such a key album for Pearl Jam is because it's when they started sounding truley different. V.S. was not a refabricaiton of Ten in anyway, but I think that about half of it's songs could be put on Ten and make sense. Vitalogy is completely different. Also, up until Binaural, which is really not very good at all, Pearl Jam seems to get steadily more musically creative, experimental, and complex on each of their albums. If you play guitar, I think you'll find that Vitalogy's songs are much harder to play and use a greater variety of riffs and chords than V.S. and certainly Ten. I think that Vitalogy is probably the most important album for Pearl jam because it puts them on the next level. It shows that they can play all kinds of different sounds with their music, and do them well. Lyrically and Vocally this album is very good as well, with many dark, crackling vocals from Vedder, and very deep lyrics that really talk about important things. Also, I think Betterman and Nothingman are 2 of the greatest songs of Pearl Jam's, the 90's, or even ever. They are both so beautiful and melodic, that they are truely songs for the ages. If you're going to buy just one Pearl Jam album, I would not suggest this one. I would suggest V.S. as it gives you a good idea of what the band sounds like, and is an awsome album all the way through. However, I think if you're going toreally get into Pearl Jam like me, this is a definate must-have. I think Pearl Jam is arguabley the best band of the 90's that sounds like a 90's band (U2 is more of an 80's band, and Widespread Panic sounds like a 70's Classic Rock band).<br />Other Bands I suggest: Nirvana, Widespread Panic, U2, Dave Mathws Band, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Blood Sugar Sex Magik and Californication, Barenaked Ladies, Grateful Dead, The Who, Led Zepplin, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, Blues Traveler, The Doors, Pete Yorn, Dashboard Confessions, Weezer's Blue Album, The Beatles (though they're a little overated), R.E.M. Automatic for the People and previous albums, Sublime, Los Lobos, Neil Young, Crosby Stills and Nash, and if you're going to listen to Punk, Green Day or Alkaline Trio, the only punk bands I know of with any talent.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I have read some bad reviews of this movie.  It is easy not to like if you pick it apart.  I found the movie very fun to watch.  It had a good simple monster movie feeling behind it.  Of course it has been done before, what hasn't?  If you like a good monster movie to set back eat some popcorn on a Friday night this is your movie.  If you want something serious watch something else.
B00004TH83|3.0|3 stars in this CD only because it is not her best American debut. Her prior works are much more impressive.<br />I am tired of people comparing Lara to Celine. Lara is much more ballad oriented. Lara is much more poignant, heart felt, passionate and international. Lara sings in Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, English and French. The Barbra and Celine don't. Oh, Lara writes her all of her own songs. Celine and Barbra don't.<br />Once again, accusing Lara of oversinging is like saying that Opera is too much screaming, that boats float too much, that caviar is too salty, that ice cream is too cold and sweet, that Chinese people look too Chinese, that birds fly too high... You get the idea. Everything has its place. If you don't like caviar or French Cuisine, it doesn't mean that the former two are no good, it just mean that you don't like them.  It is just a matter of PERSONAL taste / sensibility / preference / perspective / frame of mind.  I mean you wouldn't get a country western music critic to analyze rhymth and blues music!!  How about getting a Chinese guy, trained in Chinese Peking High Opera, reviewing Hip Hop or Hardcore Rap.  How about a Hard Rock Head Banger rating a Barry Manilow concert? <br />Lastly, Good Music, Perspective, Good Taste are just so Subjective!! <br />But Lara... Lara sings with the level of honesty, sincerity, raw emotions that go beyond the limits of any language, not withstanding the powerful and dynamic delivery.  My first Lara CD was \\"PURE\\" after a recommendation from my Parisien Chinese cousin from France. The CD is now beyond over used. It looks like it was run over by a mack truck.  The other all time favorite is \\"CARPE DIEM\\".  I tell you, when I do her songs in Karaoke bars, people pay attention.  The head turners for me are \\"To Love Again\\" sung in French \\"Si Tu m'aimes\\", \\"Pour Que tu M'aimes Encore\\", \\"Perdere L'Amore\\", \\"Ici\\", \\"Je Vivrai\\", \\"Je Suis Malade\\", \\"Tout\\" and \\"J'ai Zappe\\" and of course \\"Adagio\\".  I usually don't want to sing too many foreign songs for fear of alienating folks.<br />I just wish that they would have CARUSO, Lara Fabian's version, for karaoke.<br />I look forward to her next album next year after her massive concert schedule in Europe and Quebec, Canada to promote her \\"NUE\\" album. I look forward to the day when she does a duet with my other all time idol, Latin Singer Luis Miguel.<br />I bid you Peace and Good Living.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall is such a treat to listen to!  She calls to mind the days when music was about sensuality, beauty and joy.  The only thing you will not like about this CD is that it dosen't have more songs on it!  It's well worth the price.  I just wish she could record and release faster!<br />I saw here perform in Chicago in 2000.  I just sat there as her voice drifted over the audience... it was like a warm soft breeze flowing through my soul.<br />Krall has quickly become one of my all-time favorites.
B0000541AM|5.0|A great DVD that everyone should own. I've watched it 20,000 times. The quotes I use everyday. &quot;Stay against the crowd&quot; and &quot;We aint got one.&quot; The DVD is astonishingly crisp and clear and the music that's one when they're being chased through the park is sweet. The only complaint, however, is the daytime scene before the journey to the Bronx. I was seriously hoping it was on the DVD. Please join me in writing a letter to the studio to produce the full,uncut version in the future. And the cover on the VHS would look nice on the DVD. Anyways, still a must buy and a great watch.
0679437223|3.0|This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. I gave up early on and came back to it after reading one good review after another. The first few hundred pages can be confusing and even dull. Heller's disjointed out-of order story telling technique is very hard to come to grips with. There are some entertaining passages even at the beginning but you have to slog through many dimwitted puns. There are some scenes that are quite funny. The best, in my mind, is a scene near the end, where Yossarian is offered the chance to go home by the Colonels that have been tormenting him. There's only one catch, he has to agree to like them, to be their pal, and say good things about them. This is unacceptable and he chooses instead to run away. Skip the puerile chapter titled \\"Major Major Major Major.\\" The one joke of this insult to the reader's intelligence is the character's name: Major Major Major and the rank he is automatically promoted to on joining the army.<br />It gets better after the slow start and story begins to come together once you get halfway through. Yossarian, or Yo-Yo to his friends, is the unhappy and psychotic bombardier who is the central character of this non-story. He's afraid of dying and is upset that his superiors have repeatedly raised the number of combat missions he must fly before he can go home. His friends are killed while incompetent, evil people are promoted and prosper. The black-marketeers Ex-PFC Wintergreen and especially Milo Minderbinder get rich. He's haunted by the memory of a fellow flyer (Snowden) dying in his arms over Avignon. <br />Whether you think this novel is a good or not, it exists and many people who have never read the book are familiar with the title phrase. Heller uses Yossarian's situation to makes some points about the absurdity of war and, perhaps, of modern life in a Capitalist society. He points out that you are \\"free\\" just as long as you never actually want to use any of your freedom. It's interesting to see a depiction of American soldiers during WWII who have absolutely no patriotic or heroic feelings but are only concerned with saving their skin or perhaps profiting from the situation they are in. Mailer, in The Naked and the Dead, and other authors have expressed these sentiments better. This take on war and American society came to be the norm in the aftermath of the Vietnam War but it probably seemed very subversive when this book came out in 1961.
B0000026NC|5.0|Only 3.5 stars over all is surprising. I would give it 4.5 as it is an excellent live album that you don't have to listen to endless amounts of applause. We don't have to beat an album up because of who is in the band and who isn't, truth is the music is nothing short of awesome. I would recommend this cd to anyone without hesitation and I own all floyd discs. A very enjoyable listen IMHO although, I don't hold a doctorate in Floydology as some reviewers feel they have.
B00004Y2FT|5.0|The Cocteau Twins are one of the most underappreciated acts of all time. They succeeded in creating a very distinctive and innovative sound that makes much of what is labeled &quot;alternative&quot; music seem like Top 40. What I find most fascinating about this band is that while on the surface their work is very avant-garde, after closer investigation one finds that it has very strong Scottish national roots to it, just as much as a band like U2 (who are considered &quot;alternative&quot;) has a very distinctive &quot;Irish&quot; sound. Though I do not currently have any other of the band's albums, I am certain that this compilation is a superb introduction. There is quite a bit of material here, and while it is not all equally superb, none of it is bad. &quot;Aikea Guinea&quot; has to be the most beautiful tune ever composed in the alternative music genre. Other great tracks are &quot;Pearly Dewdrops-drops,&quot; &quot;Lazy Calm,&quot; &quot;Carolyn's Fingers,&quot; &quot;Iceblink Luck&quot;, and plenty more! This is music that is to be EXPERIENCED, not something you sing along to. Yet how memorable it all is...
B00000AFWZ|4.0|Too many great songs to mention here. Generaly the remastering on the four cds is good, however, there are a few warts.There are a few a few songs in my opinion that are just outright stinkers but only a few. This set is excellent value.You would have to spend a ton of cash to avail yourself to these artist, if you could find them. I couldn't agree with&quot;mikeonthemike&quot; more that one should burn all the songs you like and then you would have a 5+ rating. This box set is highly recommended and I believe better han Nuggets 2 as it has more variety.
B000002A3T|5.0|As a follow-up effort to the extremely lackluster Momentary Lapse of Reason, I really didn't expect much from the Division Bell.  However, the remaining members of the band returned from thier 7+ year hiatus with a pretty good album.  The music is typical Floyd, spacey and intricate with plenty of great melodic ideas that would have fit in perfect somewhere between Meddle and Dark Side of the Moon.  The area where this album really misses the mark is in the lyrics (Read: Please come back Roger).  There is an overall theme throughout the album, but it seems extremely forced and a little fake.  It is almost like David Gilmour is trying to be as much like Waters as a lyricist, and the shoe just doesn't fit.  Lyrics have never been Dave's strong suit, and even with the help of outside collaborators (including Gilmour's wife) the bitterness and overall feeling in the lyrics fails to even come close to the worst stuff that Roger has ever done.<BR>Musically though, The Division Bell shows that the band hasn't lost the ability to write a great song.  Gilmour's guitar work is as good as it has ever been, especially on the instrumental \\"Marooned\\".  In fact, I think this album better serves as a vehicle for Gilmour's playing and probably would have worked better if they just had Dave solo over the entire thing.  Despite all of the negatives, this is still a great album.  It just pales in comparison to anything that Roger has been involved in (both as Pink Floyd and as a solo artist.)
B000053VAF|5.0|A quick primer -- Kevin Smith is the tiny indie director/comic book fan who managed to land deals with Miramax and Universal and has made five of the best, funniest movies of the past decade.<br />Dogma is the fourth of these five films, and is every bit as good as anything Smith has ever done. The story focuses on a pair of fallen angels (Affleck and Damon) who find a loophole to allow them to get back into Heaven -- which, of course, will unmake all existance. (It makes sense in context, trust me) It's up to Linda Fiorentino to stop them -- with the help of a muse (Salma Hayek), the 13th Apostle (Chris Rock) and a pair of unlikely prophets in the form of Smith's constant goofball heroes, Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Smith himself, respectively). Alan Rickman also does a great turn as Metatron, the voice of God.<br />A lot of people griped about this movie, saying it was anti-Church, anti-Catholic... but as a practicing Catholic myself, let me tell you, this is perhaps the most faith-AFFIRMING movie I've ever seen. While this movie certainly isn't for everyone, anyone who appreciates Smith's sense of humor will love a movie that leaves you feeling that God exists, God is good, and if we'd all just lighten up things would be a heck of a lot better in this world.<br />This special edition makes the movie even better, letting you see the stuff Smith (wisely) left on the cutting room floor. A lot of it is great stuff, but it simply would have disrupted the flow of the movie. Still, the &quot;Fat Albert&quot; deleted scene alone is worth the price of the set.<br />Oh -- and good luck finding the two hysterical Easter Eggs -- &quot;How Mewes thinks Kevin directs&quot; and &quot;How Kevin actually directs.&quot;
B000002MP2|5.0|5 stars all the way!!! every song is great(although some r greater then others) ....from Burnout to Having a Blast to Basketcase and FOD every song is cathcy fun and 100% Green Day if someone doesnt know or who has never heard of Green Day this is the one i would tell them to buy first!! also \\"International Superhits\\" to hear everything that Green Day has done ...but this is the one that started it all! whatever Green Day does next im pretty sure they wil not get better then this...DONT HAVE IT? GET IT!!!
B00005V9QJ|2.0|Let me first preface this by saying that I adore Sade's music. When I purchased the live CD, I certainly expected there to be some crowd noise, but this CD is ruined by an audience that will not shut up. Rather than a respectful, appreciative audience these morons scream, hoot and holler through entire songs...often right over the quietest parts of songs. Sade cannot take a breath without some idiot screaming.  While listening, you literally cannot count to 10 without loud hoots, and screams. To make matters worse, these sounds were intentionally mixed in through the house microphones. That's why they are so loud and intrusive. Beautiful performances ruined by Rednecks who thought they were at the tractor pull.  Save your money,  The label should remix and re-release this CD.
B0000039PW|5.0|Yo, this is truly the best rap album ever made. How could you go wrong with \\"Gimme The Loot\\", \\"Juicy\\", \\"Unbelievable\\", and \\"Respect\\". It's 2 times as good as Life After Death and a million times better than Born Again. Biggie definitely saved the flows for this one. The one thing that doesn't make it a perfect album is all of it's samples. I noticed that he sampled \\"Between The Sheets\\" by the Isley Brothers on \\"Big Poppa\\". And \\"Juicy\\" and \\"Respect\\" were sampled by some songs in the 80's. Other than that, he made a brilliant album. Yeah, people say Pac is the best rapper. He's aiiiight, but he can never touch Ready To Die. If you don't have it, you obviously don't like rap music. Listening to it is better than sex, OK. Cool, I'm out. Peace
B00003BDXG|5.0|its in my favoraite disks folder. i'm usually  not to crazy about dvd extras but the alternate ending is very good i thought.<br />i've had no problems playing this dvd. <br />i'm even thinking to buy the directors cut dvd for fun. maybe anyway .<br />this disk is a good buy.
0060987464|5.0|Marilyn Manson is one of the best authors I have read anything by recently.  His autobiograpy (with Neil Straus assisting)is hands down an amazing look into the life of a televangelist's worst enemy.  The book basically flows in chronological order, with a few unpublished magazine articles strewn about in the middle to tell that part of the story, which took place during the recording process for &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;.  Otherwise, the stories from his childhood, to the days of trying to get a record deal, to the backstage antics on tour, the story definitely keeps your attention.  From some of the more twisted to the tame, I'm not sure if anything has been imbellished by Manson, but even if it has that should not turn anyone away from reading this incredible work.  Everybody should read this book.  While fans on Manson, Nietzsche, and Anton Szandor LaVey would enjoy the book the most, even people who don't especially like Marilyn Manson will get a better understanding of where he's coming from and what his real message is, not what they take it to be from the shock-rock antics on stage and on television.  But if you don't want to be enlightened on the brilliant mind behind the man, at least find the book in the library, and read over his &quot;rules&quot;, which show his cynical and tell-all humor.
0767002652|5.0|If you have never seen this exceptional British television series, or if it has been many years since you have, you must take a look and I guarantee you will be captivated.  This is possibly the highest quality television soap opera ever produced, detailing the lives of those living both upstairs and downstairs in one of London's most aristocratic houses at the beginning of the 20th century.  The characters are diverse, the storylines beautifully written and the detailed attention to costuming and set design are impeccable.  I was absolutely enthralled and have now purchased all seasons of this magnificant series and will watch them again and again.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson stars as \\" William Wallace\\" in this Popular and award winning epic that is incredibly amazing and brutal at the same time. It's where is a Scottish leader with troops to defend Scotland against the english, no words can describe this movie.<br />Go See it!!!
B00005RDRO|4.0|The humor and the movie have both held up very well given its age, and Thank God they finally released it on DVD.  It's a classic sendup to all of the early detectives from both Books and Movies.  To those familiar with all of the characters, it will provide hoots of laughter.  To those who simply don't know who Charlie Chan or Truman Capote are (or the other characters), well, it may seem over the top.<br />My one main complaint is WHY did the DVD (and the VHS) cut one of the funniest scenes at the end of the movie when Sherlock Holmes &amp; Dr. Watson show up late for the party/murder???  It would be interesting to know the reason for the deletion as the scene was certainly worth keeping intact within the ending of the movie.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This movie was unbearable to watch!  Two other people attempted to watch this movie with me and not one of us could stand it.  We turned it off halfway through and regretted wasting money on this mess of a movie.  We tried to give the movie a chance, but it was too horrible to keep watching.  There were too many scenes with characters screaming and yelling their lines.  Most actors were overacting, trying too hard to &quot;project.&quot;  It seems like the director wanted to attempt to resurrect the movie musical by updating a classic by applying pop music and MTV video styling.  I do not recommend this mess.
0451191153|5.0|This is about a very young friend who means the whole world to me, but whom I shall not name.<br />There was a time - not very long ago - when he had lost all hope. He felt an immense guilt for what he was. He reached a point of depression where he was convinced that not only was he incapable of realizing his dreams and attaining happiness in life, but a greater monstrosity-that he did not deserve to be happy. Every night he went to bed with a blade in his hand thinking that he wouldn't see the next day's sunrise. Once he walked down to the chemist for sleeping pills. He punished himself in many other ways. I needn't mention the cause- he wasn't always like that- this state of mind had its own reasons -arising from his view of life, of mankind, of man, of himself.<br />Then he picked up and read \\"The Fountainhead\\". <BR>Since then his motto has been-\\"I can, I will, I shall triumph.\\"<BR>He has never looked back; he told me that he was sure that that phase will never return-because the image of Howard Roark is always in his mind.<BR>Later I learnt that this had happened to more people than just him. <BR>Then I realized that this novel has a power which hardly any other has - a power to make a man fall in love with this world, with life, with himself.<BR>(Another novel which achieves, in terms of the broadest abstractions, the same effect is Henryk Sienkiewicz's \\"Quo Vadis?\\")<br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" gives man the courage to dream and to fight to realize his dream, the courage to live your life on your own terms, the courage to say \\"Yes\\" when everything around you is screaming \\"No\\".<BR>It tells you that this world is a place where every man, provided he has a vision and is passionate about it, will achieve his values- however hard the struggle- the pain of the struggle does not matter, only the joy of its fruit; where good shall triumph over evil.<BR>It glorifies-above all- independence and integrity.<BR>It salutes the man of intelligence, of competence, of genius.<BR>Itis a hymn to the treasure house that is this world, the beautiful experience that is life and the hero that is man.<br />Ayn Rand has said, in this novel: \\"Whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives,  men seek a NOBLE vision of MAN'S NATURE and of LIFE'S POTENTIAL.\\"<BR>(The caps are by me). <BR>This is precisely what \\"The Fountainhead\\" accomplishes-in the character and story of Howard Roark.<BR>This is greatest gift that a thinker and a visionary can give to the youth who shall shape the world tomorrow-and to a human being at the threshold of life.
0060987464|4.0|The book is: Marilyn Manson, A Long Hard Road out of Hell, and can be defined as anything but sweet, wholesome and pure.  I would consider it, dark, disturbed and hella interesting. If you know anything about Marilyn Manson, you know that he is more abnormal than most. This book shows just how \\"out there\\" he really is.  The book starts by describing his childhood and moves through out his life in chronological order.  He talks about the people he grew up with and family (or lack there of) he had.  He talks about his religious background, first being Christian (in a catholic school) and then becoming a Satanist. There are tons of sick and twisted stories in here.  There are things involving his perverted grandfather's obsessions, his cocaine use, the sex he has had, the relationships that took him for a ride and a collection of his own writings, such as stories and poems he attempted to get published.  He goes in depth talking about the times he spent with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and the wacked-out things he did with Twiggy Rameraz.  I found A Long Hard Road out of Hell to be very well written and definitely an interest keeper.   There were many times I couldn't put it down as I kept thinking to myself, \\"what's going to pop out of this guy's thoughts next,\\" and, trust me, something always did.
6305144176|3.0|The real strength of this movie is that it lets Robin Williams be Robin Williams in a way that few of his other films do.  Fans of the stand-up comedian will find him in top form, as he adlibs his way through his numerous bits as a manic DJ on US Services radio.  (OK, so in this movie, he's more of a sit-down comedian.)  He does the black voice, the gay voice, the cracker voice...you know the routine.  And it's as rapid-fire as his own performances, so even if one gag's a dud, you're laughing hysterically 15 seconds later.<br />The plot itself is creaky, and as sentimental,in it's wiseacre way, as some of his more recent schlocky efforts.  Beneath the mania of a Robin Williams (or a Jim Carrey, as we've seen of late) beats a heart of pure mush.  Luckily, in this film, the mania predominates.
B00005214X|5.0|I got this album for Christmas, although I used to listen to it with my brother back when it was released.  I had forgotten just how good an effort it was.  I agree to a point with one of the commentators that Phil Spector's production is a bit much.  But on the other hand, that is part of what makes this album so distinctive.  His wall of sound is unique.  The jams with what is basically Derek and the Dominoes plus Harrison and Dave Mason are good to listen to.  Bottom line is you have one of the Beatles,with Spector, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason,and some of the most polished studio musicians around at that time; it really is a good album.
B00004SAAY|5.0|Pinnock and the English Concert give limber &amp; exciting readings of these works; the Triple Concerto especially. I would recommend this set highly for both those familiar with this music, and those just discovering it.
B00000IO4J|5.0|The Faculty has an excellent cast. Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett are two of the insanely talented young actors. The movie brings together six kids from different high school cliques: Casey the geek, Zeek the drug dealer (rebel), Stockly the goth, Stan the jock, Delilah the cheerleader, and Marybeth the new girl. The movie's plot is kinda bad but it pokes fun at itself, which, in a way, makes up for it. There's kinda a \\"breakfast club\\" theme in the end when they all become friends and all that. I loved this movie. Again, Wood and Hartnett really stand out as excellent young actors. Definatly a movie worth checkin out.
B00000I2PG|5.0|This album is, quite simply, the best album of the '80s.  The blend of all of Martin Fry's influences: Smokey Robinson's lyrical jaunts, mellow strings of pre-orchestral rock, and the pure bad-ass funk of '70s Motown are brought together in sheer perfection.<br />\\"The Look of Love,\\" \\"Valentine's Day,\\" and \\"Date Stamp\\" are Martin Fry at his ascerbic, romantic best.  And the music.  When Fry takes interludes, nothing falls flat.  Bass lines stay complex, drums keep time, synthesizers...synthesize?  Hey, it was the '80s.<br />Get this album.  Buy this album.  Love this album.  If you ever meet Martin Fry, thank him for making this album.
B000060MY6|4.0|David Lynch's world in all of his creations always seems to have these lively, colorful, postmodern, eerie, surreal settings-- especially where evil and the underworld seem to be a manipulative force within the at first seemingly \\"innocent setting\\" we encounter.  Since we already may see Hollywood as sinister (especially 90's Hollywood), one may wonder why Lynch would make a movie about Hollywood.  But this is a Lynchesque version, and seeing Hollywood with the same take as Twin Peaks and the 50's suburbs of \\"Blue Velvet,\\" is actually very novel.<br />The main story (though actually all \\"stories\\" are interconnected) is about a dark-haired woman actress who we first see is going to be murdered on Muholland Drive, but due to car accident, escapes alive, but loses her memory-- and a blonde-haired woman named Betty, who travels from Canada to stay at her aunt's apartment and to prepare for her big acting audition in Hollywood.  She finds the dark-haired woman in the apartment and she becomes the protector for the dark-haired woman as they both try to figure out who the dark-haired woman is, and why someone wants her dead.  <br />The other characters in the film seem to be familiar Hollywood types, that as expected in a Lynch film can serve as archetypes: the \\"artiste,\\" big-shot independent director all dressed in black, the mysterious man with the big telephone seeming to control everything, a cowboy (I won't say anything more, you have to see him to believe!), the junkie waitress (or prostitute?), the totally inept hitman.  Oh, and then there's Coco, the apartment manager, whose look and name seems to be a throwback of the 30's and 40's movie diva!  There are some very hilarious moments in the movie as the audience captively watches still trying to figure out what exactly is going on, and what type of \\"conspiracy\\" is at foot.<br />The tricky part of this movie is that just when you think you are grounded, you are not, and disoriented you will totally be.  If you're looking for a movie that mimics the literary principle of deconstruction-- this is it!  <br />The imagery of the movie and its impact on the viewer's mind-- this is Lynch at his directing best.  You leave the movie theatre (or video or DVD) putting the disjointed images together in your mind, finding the symbolic patterns, the cohesive thread of this picture.  Perhaps the most vivid scence is the one in an odd old Hollywood theatre that shows a puzzling performance piece called the \\"Silencio.\\"  The painted Hispanic woman, a woman \\"lipsynching\\" to a woman singing Roy Orbinson's \\"Crying\\" in Spanish, the \\"gothic\\" look of the Depression-era theatre . . .<br />The only drawback to this movie is that it was originally written to be a pilot of a TV series.  Some characters' identities and their place in this Lynch vision of Hollywood are never developed, unfortunately, probably because they were supposed to be \\"regulars\\" in the series.  Still, as a film it holds up.  The only warning I may give is that you may want to watch this film a second time to better appreciate it, let alone put the puzzle pieces together!  What I will advise you, dear movie watchter, that if you notice one of the minor characters  doing something very odd, remember it!
0060987464|5.0|The Long Hard Road Out of Hell written by Marilyn Manson with Neil Strauss is the autobiography of singer Marilyn Manson (a.k.a. Brian Warner).  Every Manson fan should read this book, as well as everyone that hates what Manson does and stands for. I think both extreems or anyone that is indifferent can learn something interesting from reading this book. This way everyone can understand and not just assume what Manson is about. The book describes Manson's childhood, his transformation into Marilyn Manson, and his decent into the Anti-Christ Superstar, which was the album Manson finshed at the end of the book. In the book he describes what went on backstage, on the tours before Anti-Christ Superstar, these things were more then demented. The way it is described, however, is facinating, which makes it even more apalling, but hard to put down. His story is a one of abuse- mental and psyical, drugs, sex, and rock music. It is funny and frightening all at once. Simply a good book to read for everyone no matter what opinion they have about Manson. It reminds us that Manson is a person, he's had a tough life, and the book explains how he has dealt with it.
B0000025D0|5.0|For Springsteen fans there isn't much I can add to this.  They have all listened to it.  For those of you just discovering Bruce Springsteen's enormous works of art this is a key album.  He becomes a man in this album and doesn't hold back one feeling.  Stark, angry, hopeful, emotional...awesome.  He believes in The Promised Land!!!
0871137380|5.0|I have read many military books and none captured the truth the way Bowden does in Black Hawk Down. It gives the reader insight into a military operation that went chaotic fast. It revealed the miscommunications, the conflict between CPT Steele and the Delta Commander, and the zeal of soldiers under fire. I found this book intriguing, enticing and a MUST read for every soldier, from PVT to General. I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This entire album seemed like it should have been the bridge between the last two albums (Ok computer and Stuido Kid A). Radiohead seems to always try something new. While it seemed to alienate many other than felxible listeners with the radically electronic Kid A, Amnesiac moves back to a Rock feel (Amnesiac-Morning Bell). I think that their return to rock is appreciated... but their continued experimentation is also looked at in a high light.
B00004U8JU|5.0|If you love science fiction moives, you'll love this DVD. It has plenty of action, suspense, hair-raising adventure, and the most real live dinosaur special effects, that I've ever seen. Just like the movie, the story plot played very well into the action part of the movie and the actors were well casted. This DVD has a great menu that consist of a chapter list, bonus materail including, The Making of Jurassk Park, and a section for Caption and Subtitle offering English, Spanish and Franch.This is definitely a collector's edition. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B0000025T6|5.0|Sandwiched right into The River and Born in the USA this shows how Springsteen's work covers all areas.  He tells you how he feels about growing up and human nature at its worst sometimes.  &quot;But when it's your brother, sometimes you look the other way&quot;  Buy it!!
0618002227|4.0|I thought that this was a pretty good book.  The characters are well described and played out throught the book.  Their journey starts in the Shire where we meet Frodo and Bilbo Baggins.  Gandalf the Grey comes to Bilbo's 111th birthday party and Bilbo shares plans to leave the Shire to adventure again after his party is near over. Gandalf sees a change in his life long friend from the last time that he saw him.  Bilbo mentions of a ring that he found on his last adventure that he took and also mentions that when he has the ring with him he doesnt feel a year older.  When Gandalf trys to convince Bilbo to leave the ring behind when he leaves, Bilbo goes crazy.  Gandalf finally convinces Bilbo that it is best to leave the ring to Frodo when he leaves.  Frodo doesnt know how powerful the ring is until he is instructed to leave the Shire because it is not safe with him there.  He travels with 3 other friends (who are all hobbits like him) to Bree to find the Prancing Pony Inn. There they meet Strider who is a trusted friend of Gandalf and protects the boys through the night from the Ring Wraiths.  The Next day the party of five now leaves for Rivendell to reunite with Gandalf.  On the way during one night the group is attacked by the Ring Wraiths and Frodo is injured by one.  Arwen (the daughter of Elrond) is trusted by Strider to take Frodo ahead of the group to Rivendell because Frodo needs Elrond's treatment to stop his transformation into a Ring Wraith.  Frodo arrives savely and recieves treatment, then soon learns of why he was attacked specifically.  The Council of Elrond, which consists of a representitive of the nine areas of Middle Earth(with the exception of Mordor).  Together they decide to have Frodo take the ring to Mordor to destroy it in the place where it was created.  Now the Fellowship consisting of nine members, four hobbits, two warriors, an elf, a dwarf and a wizard, set out on their incredible journey across Middle Earth to take back the one ringof power.  Through The Misty Mountains and the underlying caves, the Fellowship embarks on a journey that faces them against such foes as: Orcs, A Giant Octupuss, Ring Wraiths and a Balrog.  Though the party loses Gandalf to the Balrog, the Fellowship pushes on toward their goal of Mordor. Facing many other challenges and triumphs.

B00005QDW1|1.0|I was given this CD for my birthday, and I can tell you I'm sorry someone thought this was a nice gift! This was a total waste of money.  The music has been done, the sounds are nothing but regurgitated 80's synthesizers and wanna-be reggae.  Hey guys, remember when Blondie made it big and then tried the reggae thing?  Didn't work for them, and NoDoubt didn't make it work either.  The only song worth listening to - Hey Baby - has been played so much I'm sick of hearing it. Save your money. Go buy one of the &quot;best of the 80's&quot; compilations.  The sounds are about the same. If you want the CD, write me and I'd be happy to send you mine!
B00005QDW1|3.0|Let's not go overboard here. Its not bad enough to deserve a 1-star review, but not worthy of these 5-star reviews either. No Doubt should have written the sound track for &quot;That 80'S Show&quot;. Rock Steady is a giant leap backwards for the band. I personally, being a big No Doubt fan, am disappointed with this album, because I dont like hip-hop. If you do, than you may love this album. The guitar has been replaced by keyboards sporting sounds we haven't heard since MC Hammer. At the same time, I am glad they did new stuff as far as lyrics. I was getting kinda tired of hearing all about Gwen's love life, but she's looking better than ever!
B000007T1M|5.0|&quot;I had an out of body experience, the other day, her name was jesus, and for her everyone cried, everyone cried, everyone cried&quot; shouts Serj Tankian on the opening track &quot;Suite-Pee&quot;.  You may have heard System Of A Down's first release was an angry, politically fueled call to arms, well in that case you have heard right.  Though it does not match up to it's predecessor &quot;Toxicity&quot;, this self titled album is by no means a weak showing.  In many ways it might not be completly fair to compare the two albums, due to the fact each one stands alone in it's own existence.  Their self titled release confronted many more issues concerning (but not limited to) anarchy, war, poverty, all of which is showcased in a beautiful lyrical presentation courtesy of Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian.  Intense guitar rifts, shredding basslines and fast beating drums rip through your speakers while Serj preaches to the masses.  System fan's should not be without this one, nor should most music listeners as well.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I am only writing this review in order to bring down the average rating for this movie.  One star is not low enough, yet they do not allow negative values.<BR>Let me assure you that I am not a mindless movie buff, and I despise ranting as much as the next person.  With that in mind, I have to say that A.I. was a steaming pile.  This movie ranges from totally predictable (\\"real\\" boy comes out of coma...who didn't see that coming?) to utterly stupid and contrived (robot boy frozen for years, only to be thawed out by aliens...Spielberg, what were you thinking?)  I hoped beyond hope that this movie would just end.  Granted, the beginning has its merits, but these are quickly shot down by scenes such as the rounding up and extermination of robots, or the friendship between a (supposedly) unfeeling sexbot and a boy programmed only to \\"love\\" one person.<BR>Oh, if I only had more than 1000 words, I could get into serious detail about how much I could not stand this movie.  Let me just warn you and say it isn't worth the time it takes to watch, unless you really like to rag on cruddy movies.  In that case, this movie is a festival of potentially good ideas turned bad.
B00003BDXG|3.0|Be forewarned: this movie contains copious scenarios of gratuitous violence.  For responsible adults only.<br />This film uses a compelling blend of surreal cinematography and animation to convey the drugged-out world perceived by its protagonists, Mickey and Mallory.  When I first saw it, I was appalled.  However, I found it increasingly compelling and entertaining after repeated viewings.<br />Don't expect a moving love story, or the tale of two rebels unjustly persecuted by society.  Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play two BAD people out to kill anyone and everyone just for the thrill of it.  If you enjoy well produced films and visual spectacles, and can park your morals at the door for a couple of hours, I would recommend this film.  If not, it would be best to pass on this one.
B000001DYA|5.0|I have several versions of SUMMERTIME BLUES including Eddie Cochran's (Jerry Capehart/Eddie Cochran-Liberty #55144), and I consider Blue Cheer's version to be far and away the best.  This group defines the heavy metal genre circa 1970.  I bought the LP when it was originally issued (Philips PHS 600-264) and I am listening to it right now.  Although SUMMERTIME BLUES is the main reason I put the album on my record player, I usually end up playing the entire album, frequently more than once.  It just seems to be right.  In general, LP's seem to have a more mellow sound that CD's.  I don't have the CD version of this album, so I cannot rate the CD.  However, I give the LP five stars.
B00005QZWI|5.0|First, let me just say that &quot;May It Be&quot; by Enya is INCREDIBLE!  LOTR was an incredible movie and the music from this soundtrack portrays the movie exactly.  Hearing the soundtrack brought me back to the images from the movie.  This soundtrack is absolutely stunning, in the way it conveys a lot of emotions.  The music is really powerful and inspiring, oscillates from dark and light... and it's really hard to describe it in words.  One thing that I could say is that this soundtrack will not disappoint all fans of Middle Earth.  I'd have to say this is one of the best soundtracks I've bought.
0679777547|4.0|'The Club Dumas' is essentially a detective story, although the hard-boiled, gin-drinking, chain-smoking private eye in this novel is also a highly educated and well-paid book detective named Lucas Corso.  The plot revolves around Corso who, like many other fictional P.I.'s, takes on two apparently unrelated cases but soon discovers hints that there may be a link between the works he is investigating: a 17th century Satanic text and a 19th century Dumas manuscript.  What makes 'The Club Dumas' truly unique is the fact that Corso, as a literary expert, recognizes that he is wrapped up in a standard mystery plot and surrounded by people who behave just like stock fictional characters.  Even though the mercenary, almost nihilistic Corso is not a very appealing character, he manages to elicit some sympathy as he is a \\"second level reader\\" who looks between the lines of the story being written around him in just the same fashion as any intelligent person reading the novel would.   The only difference is that Corso  (much to his chagrin) is actively involved in the story, and cannot view the developing action from a more comfortable detached position.<br />The author deluges the reader with references to other popular books and films, creating a melange of culture which he uses to define Corso as an individual.  Reverte also references many obscure works and makes use of the literary tool of creating \\"forbidden\\" occult texts, in this case 'The Book of The Nine Doors' that Corso researches, as well as its lost predecessor, the dread 'Delamelonicon'.  This technique was pioneered by H.P. Lovecraft, who would use such references as part of a systematic attack on the reader's skepticism, forcing him or her to believe in the unthinkable terror that the characters in the story find themselves in.  Reverte cleverly recognizes that this concept of forbidden texts has become another stock feature of modern fiction, and incorporates it in 'The Club Dumas' as a tool to (mis?)lead both Corso and the reader down a dark path, which he alternates with the seemingly harmless Dumas manuscript of 'The Three Musketeers'.  By this juxtaposition of the lighthearted 19th century adventure novel and the venerable 17th century demonic text Reverte manages to keep both Corso and the reader guessing at where the plot is headed.<br />In short, 'The Club Dumas' is not only highly entertaining but also very interactive, thanks to a series of cryptic illustrations that form part of the puzzle that the reader tries to solve before Corso and his mysterious opponents.<br />My personal experience was that the book was enjoyable, but borrowed a few too many plot elements from Dumas, Agatha Christie, etc. for my taste. I also found Reverte to be somewhat pedantic in his name dropping of authors and titles.  Still, it is a fun read and I recommend it highly.
B00003CXI1|5.0|HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER's STONE was just an incredible movie! I have NEVER (I repeat: NEVER) had my jaw on the floor throughout an entire movie... until now. I've never seen anything like it and I can't wait to get it on DVD!
B000003CVX|5.0|I'll agree with the reviewer below that this may not be the most passionate version of the Alpine Symphony available. However, this disc is my favorite of the four Strauss discs recorded by Andre Previn on Telarc. The Symphony speaks for itself. It is a cliffhanger packed full of beautiful, energetic themes. Telarc captures the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra sound as vast as all outdoors. The glassine woodwinds and sumptuous strings descend down the mountain like the cascades of an avalanche. The near presence and dynamic range of the orchestra help promote the travelogue nature of the piece. I feel that Previn's carefully calculated reading allows the listener to absorb Strauss' stunning orchestral effects with the appropriate cold chills.
0060277246|5.0|A long time ago, four children found a magical world beyond (what they thought was) an ordinary wardrobe. This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia. I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than 1 week and that was the fastest i read a book because it was so interesting and captivating. This is now 1 of my favorite books. I recommend that others read this book and like it as i did to. I enjoyed reading this because it was so captivating. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is very courageous, and caring to others. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named something very special. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She was my least favrite because she is evil. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were given a special position in Narnia  My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he lied and said he had never been there. I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination. I liked it because it had vivid details and it was imaginative.  It was also full of great characters kids can relate to.  Since the characters were kids our age and the setting was an imaginary place it made it more fun to read.  Since the book is so good i would like to read the other series that connect to this book by C. S. Lewis. So be sure to read The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book. I have a penchant for British authors and heroines esp. after reading Bridget Jones Diary. This book, however, is simple, and more intuitive than BJD. We all can relate to the heroine's shopping mishaps, and the fact that she maxes our her credit card too! We women don't feel so alone anymore! It's a cute book, not annoying at all (unlike some parts of BJD and the sequel to it.) And the Shopaholc Takes Manhattan is even BETTER!!!! Way to go Kinsella!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is by far the most promising new artist since Dave Matthews. There are definate similarities between John Mayer and Dave Matthews, but I personally think John Mayer's songs are catchier and he has more potential for growth at this point than DMB does. You MUST buy this CD. They lyrics are raw, amazing, and beautiful.There is no other CD to spend your money on right now
B000002AGN|5.0|When I was about 7 or 8 years old, my older sister purchased  the &quot;12 Free Records&quot; from the Columbia Record Club, and one of the albums she ordered was Time Out.

B0000027RL|4.0|What was the Seattle sound?  My guess is that it fell somewhere between punk rock and the 70's hard rock that punk tried to kill.  <BR>Though Pearl Jam lean decidedly further towards the 70's hard rock sound on this album, they do so sincerely and honestly (they would explore punk much more later on, and still do).  Rather than fall into the hard rock pretentions that mock the genre, Pearl Jam inject their sound with something rare: substance.  <BR>And what a dramatic ingredient Pearl Jam's substance is to their sound.  Stone Gossards riffs are unabashedly turned-up-to-11 rock and roll, Jeff Ament's basslines are groovy and innovative (he uses 6-string, 12-string, and fretless basses with maximum effect throughout the album), Mike McCready launches some of the best rock solo's this side of Jimmy Page (transcendently furious), and of course Eddie Vedder saves it all with his over the top emotional vocals that tear out of his soul with passion and energy.  <BR>This is of course the album that made Pearl Jam famous, and it includes their most well-known material.  \\"Alive\\", \\"Black\\", \\"Even Flow\\", and of course \\"Jeremy\\" are all featured on this album that is practically a greatest hits collection in terms of popularity.  <BR>Despite the fact, this album is only their first album, and while they may have sold less records for it, they made much better records afterward by not following the formula.  Consequently, they have never been stale and have always been fresh and exciting.  This is what puts Pearl Jam in line with classic rock artists such as Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and the Clash.  They continue to challenge themselves, and I thank them for it.

B0000026NC|2.0|This live album leaves much to be desired. A great set list only to be marred by lazy Gilmour vocals and terrible Scott Page sax. You can actually hear Gilmour just saying the lyrics to Us and Them. Gilmour takes control of Floyd and does exactly what Roger said they would do &quot;Milk the name for all it is worth.&quot;. I can not say much more about the video either. It is clear that Gilomour's heart is no longer into it. The really sad part is the choice of songs for this tour. They are great songs but with a lackluster performance it is heartbreaking to hear them. Gilmour has gotten so lazy not only does he not want to sing he also turns some of the lead over to Tim Renwick. So, I give this album 2 stars and that is because of Gilmour's lead on Comfortably Numb and a great choice of songs.
B000002WPI|5.0|Everyone knows that this is the best rap album of all time, I'm just laying it out for you. Wu-Tang gave to us what was needed to signify Hip-Hop as a force to be reckoned with.Never before has the lyrical world and rap world collided in such an amazing fashion.When this album came out everyone was trying to make it big as a rapstar, but soon after they realized that it would be a lot hareder to compete with true masters such as the Clan.The Wu gave us amazing lyrics with steady beats to complete a track justly.The intro told us that they will Bring Da Rukus so you better be prepared to battle.In Shame on a Nigga they tell you whats what.In Wu-Tang Ain't Nuthing Ta F' Wit they ensure that the Clan is here and there's noplace to hide so if your gonna try to compete you better be ready to fight.Protect Ya Neck they're styles is wild and they're a threat. But the most powerful tracks are definitly Can't It Be All So Simple Then and Tearz. The tracks describe the beauty and tragedy of life, going into a time were life was different. Tearz provides us with two tales as real of life with real life conciquences.Method Man probably got the best out of this album with his own song, launching him to be the most popular member.What some fans wonder is were's Masta Killah, well if you listen closely you can hear Masta on Da Mystery of Chessboxin' with just one verse. The reason he wasn't on more was because he was locked up. If I could have given this album more than 5 stars I probably given it 10 because it's not he just the quality of the music but it's significance as a statment to the world.
6303168507|5.0|This movie is beyond 5 stars. After seeing this in 1995 i was truley facinated by Speildbergs telling of the life of Oskar Schindler. The way the film is in black and white totally sets the theme and telling of the time period. Being Jewish myself, i had read much about the horror of time. After seeing this film, it gave me a deeper look into what some of my distant relatives in Hungary had to expirience... the ghettos, the camps, the aftermath... The way Speildberg filmed it was just remarkable, it seemed as if it were actually in the time. This true story tells of how a man named Oskar Schindler, a man who saved thousands of Jews from their fate at the death camps, by placing them in his factories, providing a safe haven. But i must warn you...after seeing this film you will never be the same..this film gave me a deeper pride of my religon. And whether if you are Jewish or not, i guarantee that you this film will really make you think...and change the way you look things. This powerfull film has very graphic images and i warn you with caution, but it is worth seeing. This film is a once in a lifetime film, i reccomend it to all those who want to feel more of the great human spirit...and how one mans decision changed the life of thousands.
0451527712|2.0|It is amazing that Mary Shelley was a teenager when she wrote this novel.  Unfortunately, the amazement ends there.  This book was based on a wonderful concept.  An intelligent man creates a human-like being to compensate for his lost loves, only to watch his creature destroy more of his loved ones.  Sounds catchy, ironic, and scary!!  Sadly enough, each of these exciting points in the novel are only brushed upon.  No detail is given to the audience regarding the actual creation of the monster.  A plethora of pages are even donated to Frankensteins reaction to his creation.  At this point, I checked to make sure I hadn't accidentally stuck ten pages together from the gum I was twirling in my fingers!<br />  As in all critism, good points should be expressed.  I thoroughly enjoyed the monster's account of his adventures.  These chapters were described wonderfully, allowing readers to feel the monster's pain.  That's right, I felt badly for this destructive creature.  It did not even matter that the monster's learned speech that was so fluent and intelligent was learned in the timespan of only a year or so.  Dr. Frankenstein created quite an intelligent monster aparently.<br />  Perhaps if I hadn't anticipated a horrific story about a briliant scientist with messy hair chanting &quot;He's alive!  He's alive!&quot; over a gigantic creature, I would have enjoyed this book more.  Instead, I read a novel that would be appropriate for a segment on Saturday morning cartoons.

0451527712|3.0|Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is obviously a classic.  This book was one that I never thought I would find myself reading but the more I got into it, the more I enjoyed.  The classic story of the man who creates his own monster out of anger and aggression, is portrayed somewhat differently than what most think.  Unlike the movies, the monster is an intelligent man who knows what he wants, and the man who created him is just as smart.  The book follows the main character through his life, past, and present and somewhat into the future.  With exciting twists and turns and climatic events, Frankenstein will keep any reader interessted.  This book will make you think, use your imagination and have sympathy for the main character.  I would reccomend this book to everyone, especially those who are big fans of all the Frankenstein movies.
B00005M91K|5.0|With the anti-environment president in office and the Kyoto treaty being thrown out by the administration, one can only look upon films like this to get inspiration for change.

0425173895|5.0|I agree with the reviewer from Florida.  I have probably read about 30 Agatha Christie books and there are about 5 or so which stand out as among her best, but it's a debatable point to say which among them is THE best.  It really depends on your personal preference.  But that is excluding The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.  It is her only book which stands head and shoulders above the others.  If you have not read Agatha Christie do not make this your first choice...read a couple of her classics first (ABC Murders, Mirror Crack'd, And Then There Were None, Murder in Retrospect,...) and then read this one.  By far the best plot and great character development.  Enjoy
0060987464|5.0|of a typical Marilyn Manson love him or hate him frame of mind is through this book.  Marilyn Manson was quite the controversial person back when his autobiography, \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" published by ReganBooks, came out.  He is most commonly known for his musical works, which helped to spawn the controversy over him.  Obviously I recommend this book to any of Manson's fans that have not already read it.  I also recommend this book to anyone who is the least bit curious about Manson, and to the people who slandered him before and after the book was released.  Manson uses an interesting writing technique for this book, which is based on the idea of lumping together like ideas rather than to just portray everything in chronological order.  Now that is not to say that the book does not progress in order, because it does to a degree.  This actually is a good style because it does not leave the reader bored since he uses attention getters at the beginning of each chapter to keep the reader interested.  The plot of this autobiography develops as Manson grows older.  The book begins during his childhood, then progresses to the early stages of his band, and finally finishes with a personal growing experience at the end.  The biggest problem with this book in my opinion is that Manson goes into a little to much detail on some grotesque issues.  His description of his grandfather's pornography and masturbation in the basement is a prime example.  Another small problem is that Manson goes into detail about experiences on drugs, which to some people might promote drug use.  I would have to say this book is the best autobiography I have read to date. It is hard to put down because Manson always leaves you wanting to know what happens next. I personally got a better understanding of what stemmed Manson's hatred of religion. He made me understand whatmade him the person he is today by explaining what made him become this way by giving his reactions to events, rather than just telling the reader about events that happened.  He always put a personal spin on issues he discusses, making it easier to understand his point of view. He is very detailed on what he says, and is careful to leave nothing out, making it so that the reader has a full understanding of what he means.  As the famous quote says, \\"The only way out is through.\\"  Manson does indeed travel through Hell throughout this autobiography.

B00000JCOV|1.0|How could anyone call this death metal?  Better yet how could anyone call it even metal? Well since its on the metal stations,magazines, and mtv then I guess people tell themselves its metal.  I have nothing against slipknot being considered hard rock because that is all they are.  First these are the rules you must oblige by be called metal.<br />1. You must be able to play lead guitar, people can say lead isnt important or whatever, but I got news for you it is and it is the true key to metal.  They dont play it because they are not able to play it, if you dont believe me then why do they not use it and still call themseleves metal?<br />2. You have to be able to play real guitar licks, if you cant your screwed, just watch their guitarists fingers.  They are playing a few frets off one string repeatidely on each song, and having the distortion that backs them up. That means they cant play real guitar. Sorry you have to know that.<br />3. You sure as hell cannot mix rap with rock, it is very unmetal.<br />Slipknot have no talent, their drummer is good, but that is all.  Im sorry, im not saying fans cannot love them or anything, that is ok.  But please try to understand they are not metal, there is no such thing as nu-metal if you think about it. (The closest thing to metal today whether it is good or bad would be creed) It is just a distorted guitar with a heavy beat.  That doesnt make it metal, it is just hard rock. I used to think this nu-metal bs was great until I got into real music like Maiden,Dio,Megadeth,Type O Negative ect. Just because I may be referring to alot of older bands doesnt mean they suck. They could out play and outright all these bands today whether you like it or not. And it is sad when someone compares this band with Ozzy and Slayer. Ozzy has the true metal sound I am talking about, I dont like ozzy because he supports slipknot as a metal band, if you dont believe me then read metal edge for the ozzfests. But there is true metal, and it sureas hell isnt slipknot or any other one of these rap/core bands or whatever. As soon as slipknot fans read my review, if you truly think slipknot has talent and is metal, then learn how to play a guitar properly with proper riffs, and you will see what im saying is true. Dont just like it because its commercialized. I pity all of you who consider this metal, just understand it is hard rock and is just fun to listen to at that much for you.

I especially like the songs &quot;Hotel California,&quot; &quot;The Last Resort,&quot; and &quot;In a New York Minute.&quot; You can't go wrong with this album
B0000028W9|5.0|When a young girl in Canada, I became a fan of Leonard Cohen after buying his first record, Songs of Leonard Cohen, released in 1968.  He was in his early 30's then.  He has released a series of recordings since and published novels and books of poetry.  Themes he initiated in his writing in those early days have evolved throughout the years, still apparent in his recent work but with a more overt gentleness and cautious hope.  Take, for instance, Suzanne, from 1968, in which he wrote \\"And Jesus was a sailor/when he walked upon the water/...and when he knew for certain/only drowning men could see him/he said All men will be sailors then/until the sea shall free them.\\"  Compare this to the powerful lines in Anthem, a song on The Future.   \\"There is a crack in everything./That's how the light gets in.\\"  Both express the belief that life's afflictions (another of his themes (!)) teach and ultimately free us.<br />The caution that the lyrics on The Future are explicit surprised me.  I had not noticed.  He was almost 60 when The Future was released in 1992, but he remains, in my estimation, one of the sexiest men around.  I'm Your Man, on the CD of the same name, is the most romantic, erotic song I have ever heard.  On The Future, the song Closing Time has a different take on desire.  It describes the yearning within a Saturday night bar crawl (\\"And the moon is swimming naked/and the summer night is fragrant/with a mighty expectation of relief\\") as well as the fun (\\"So we're drinking and we're dancing/and the band is really happening/and the Johnny Walker wisdom running high\\").  But the disheartening side of quick romance and love affairs in general is woven throughout (\\"and I swear it happened just like this:/a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss/the Gates of Love they budged an inch/I can't say much has happened since\\").  The mixture of laughter and loss is ultimately sad but the song is such tightly written, vivid poetry, its beauty and insight are stunning.<br />I don't havea Leonard Cohen favorite CD-they all include songs I love, but The Future is surely a terrific addition to the collection.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|Me and my girlfriend watched this cause we had seen the trailers months before and had an inkling to see the movie. It started off just fine and might have lived up to its hype if it hadnt gotten horribly predictable and the jokes hadnt gotten horribly flat. A quarter into the film the makers drop some of the better satire and concentrate on overdone spoofs of the matrix and other things. All together we both found it to be if anything a quite boring and unfunny film, certainly not deserving of all the grandeur thrown at it since its release.
0790743523|5.0|This, one of the funniest lines in cinema, certainly one of the most famous, is actually (as afficionados know) a misquote.  What Alfonso Bedoya, who plays \\"Gold Hat,\\" actually says, when he and his bandito friends are asked for their badges, is \\"Badges?  We ain't got no badges.  We don't need no badges.  I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!\\"  I wonder if anybody at the time had any idea how funny this would hit audiences.<br /><br />John Huston wrote the screenplay (adapting B. Traven's novel) and directed his father, Walter Huston along with Humphrey Bogart, Tim Holt, and Bruce Bennett in this classic from my favorite age of cinema (the late forties/early fifties).  Walter Huston won an academy award as Best Supporting Actor in 1948 and John Huston garnered Oscars for his direction and his screenplay.  Bogart won nothing, but I have to say he did a great job.<br /><br />It's easy to think of Humphrey Bogart as always playing Humphrey Bogart as he has done in so many movies, particularly in mysteries and especially as a private eye.  But here we see a different Bogart, one who is not entirely sympathetic; indeed as the down and out Fred C. Dobbs he is a bit of a scoundrel and more than a little paranoid.  In watching this one realizes that Bogart had a much greater range than he is sometimes given credit for.  I also recall him alongside Katharine Hepburn in The African Queen (1951) also directed by John Huston, and in The Caine Mutiny (1954).  In the former he did win an Oscar, and in the latter, as Captain Queeg, he gave perhaps his most unforgettable performance.<br /><br />This is a tale of greed and the fever that arises when one hunts for gold.  Walter Huston plays a crusty old miner named Howard who tries one more time to strike it rich.  Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are seduced by the wily old miner's romantic tales and the three of them go off into the Sierra Madre mountains near Tampico, Mexico to prospect.  Naturally they hit pay dirt, but in-between the growing madness of Dobbs and the Mexican bandits, theirs is an uneasy existence.  What happens to the gold and to the three men is fascinating to watch, and we sense a timeless human psychology at work.  Bob Curtin expresses part of it this way: \\"You know, the worst ain't so bad when it finally happens.  Not half as bad as you figure it'll be before it's happened.\\"<br /><br />This movie is as good as its reputation, which is considerable, but it's not perfect.  Some of it plays a little too simplistically, as when Howard saves the Mexican boy amid the worshipful natives, and some of it is a little silly, as when the bandits mistake gold for sand--not likely!  But the almost epic quality of the tale and the felicitous direction as well as many interesting and humorous touches, make this one of the best ever made, and something no true film buff should miss.

0553062182|4.0|This book relieved me. It relieved me because I realized that I've spent years trying to define success in terms that don't apply to me. After just a few chapters I was able to find the courage and the freedom to redefine who I am, what I want to accomplish in my life, and how I want to accomplish it. I guess I always knew that I was different from others - more affected by things that seemed banal to others, but saw it as a character flaw rather than just accepting it as me. The only slightly negative comment I'd have is that the writing style is somewhat dry. But this is more than made up for by the content. My blessings and thanks to Elaine Aron. I think I'm taking the first steps to changing my life so I can live it on MY terms, and not according to what I always thought I was supposed to be or do. Freedom. This book has given me freedom!

Crazy ... happens and so on and so on.<BR>The best book I have ever read, if you like comedic books with a tinge of sanity, then you will love this book.
0452282152|3.0|Cmon guys - get serious. This book reads pretty much like what it is: an acceptable attempt of someone just out of writing class. The idea is good, Ill grant that, but then the execution doesnt convince, and the language is sometimes outright pathetic. The ridiculous similes in the first part (\\"His eyes came to rest on me like a butterfly on a flower\\", p. 42) made me want to dump the book right away. Glad I didnt do it though - had some nice moments later on, even though it only adds up to three stars.

0446678430|1.0|This book is filled with cliches, platitutes and vague concepts, but very little specific useful information.  Actually, the best thing that I inferred from the book is the best way to retire young and rich is to write a mediocre book about planning for retirement.<br />I don't intend to be overly mean, but the book has the tone of a late night television huckster peddling real estate investment scams.
B00005RDSM|3.0|\\"PETER PAN\\" a Disney favorite from 1953 has been resurrected, remastered and restored for its premier digital transfer.  The Technicolor animation is once again pristine and the sound is crystal clear.<br />Although the animation style is far-removed from the detailed, classic, illustrator style of \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Pinnochio,\\" it is still fluid, with nicely framed compositions that have a rougher, more spontaneous, almost sketchy look that ushered in a modernistic wave of Disney animation.<br />The bonus material is significant, especially the fabulous commentary track hosted by Roy Disney (Walt's nephew) and the making-of documentary with always affable and informed Leonard Maltin and old time animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson and the voice of Wendy, Kathryn Beaumont.  There's a preview of the new big screen feature \\"Return to Neverland\\" among other extras.<br />There's a notorious element to this movie in the haunting presence of the late, brilliant and beautiful child star Bobby Driscoll (the voice of Peter Pan). He was discovered dead of a drug overdose in a condemned New York tenement in 1968 and buried in a pauper's grave.  More than a year later he was finally identified through fingerprints.  \\"Peter Pan\\" is a fitting tribute to Driscoll's remarkable, natural, talents.  And the genius of Walt Disney in visualizing the darker elements barely, if even, hinted at in the original fantasy.
6304938241|2.0|The most star worthy thing I suppose is that the film started out enigmatically - for about a minute or two no one spoke a word. But the rest is forgettable as soon as they begin to speak!<br />Maybe it's because I'd read such wonderful reviews about the film - just maybe that's why it left me relatively flat - I must admit I do have somewhat of a reputation for having high expectations - it wasn't a total letdown though, it was more like I'd expected better acting, stronger feelings n emotions, better love scenes, and more importantly better storytelling. It seems to me that I don't understand a lot about this film: the flashy costume especially when the occasion does not call for one, the incessant rain in London and Venice, the attraction between Kate and Merton - how it got started and why it did. Furthermore, I don't understand the friendship between Milly and Kate. Nor do I understand the emotional connection between Merton and Milly after her death - since he had claimed he didn't love her, but was somehow in love with her memories? The money he gained from her death he didn't want, the love/marriage between him and Kate fizzled afterwards. And it just seems to me so sad, a loose-loose-loose situation....<BR>Is this supposed to be a love story? a tragedy? or what? So muchmore's missing!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|My girlfriend and I watched this movie on a whim, neither of us really expected it to be that good.  We were wrong.  I was laughing so hard my eyes were wattering, it was a very entertaing movie.  If you are a Ben Stiller or an Owen Wilson fan don't hesitate to watch this, its one of Stiller's best movies yet.
B00005QFE5|5.0|&quot;The Road Home&quot; is a moving story of innocent love between Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi) and the new local teacher from the city.  Zhao Di falls deeply in love with the teacher at first sight.  She does everything she could, in a shy way, to catch his attention.  When he notices her , he also develops a crush, but their romance is cut short when he is sent back to the city to settle some problems with the government.  Zhao Di gets incredibly depressed to the point of her hallucinating, hearing his voice at the local school reciting with his students.  When the day he was to come back, Zhao Di stands on the road side, in freezing weather to wait for him.  He doesn't show and she becomes very ill.  Even the illness didn't stop her determination, when she tries to go the city in the middle of a snow storm to find him, but faints at the side of the road where she is found and brought back home.  The story doesn't end here, so I urge you to see the movie to find out the outcome.  This is Zhang Ziyi's first movie, and it really shows her acting ability and how much she can get into a role.  The story is affective and it's not complicating.  This is a simple, sweet, and yet powerful love story, where you really feel for the characters involved.  This is a movie for all ages.  If you like Chinese dramas, this is a good one to see.
0425170349|5.0|This book is one of the best ever created.  Starts out fast and doesn't stop till the very last page.  It takes you to the minds of both terriost and the counter ops.  It has made me become very intrested in all of clancy's work and if you really like this book i would recommend Tom Clancys and Gen Carl Stiner Shadow Warriors which was just published and is about going inside special forces.  Tom Clancy imagination is amazing and you will fall in love with all of his material whether you like the armed forces or not.

0780020901|4.0|How soon we forget!  Whilst movies like 'Moulin Rouge' [the current version - NOT to be confused with the Houston masterpiece] stimulate \\"oohs\\" and \\"aahs\\" today, we tend to forget that dear old Kennie R. patented all of this way, way back!!!<br />This is not the most spectacular of the Composer bios, but quite, quite effective.  Kinda 'rapes' the senses over and over and over - that's the only way to describe it!  Magnificently costumed [Alma Mahler's train ensemble is Perfection!] Edited,<br />Scripted and Cast - give Russell his due!  Pity though that we are not treated to a widescreen, sound enhanced vision of the work - same goes for all of the rest, [especially \\"The Music Lovers\\"].<br />A great deal of ground is covered in this work - seen in flashback by Mahler [Robert Powell who also starred in 'Tommy'] who is currently on a journey with wife Alma [alumni Georgina Hale].  Miss Hale as Alma Mahler is both fire and ice, cold and sensual, deprived and depraved as Alma, and who wouldn't be?  Husband - Gustav - kep her firmly in tow, or did he?  [Forced her to abandon a most promising career - ah men!].<br />The visuals as usual are stunning - watch for Ken's cameo as a shepherd, Mahler's funeral - with the nude Alma atop the casket, gyrating.....and what's with all of the Quazi-Nazi images?  The conversion sequence - Mahler from Judiasm to Catholicism is positively sado-masochistic;  complete with a domanatrix whip weilding Cosima Wagner! Not forgetting the chrysalis opening sequence.  The early 'family' flashbacks  - the dinner sequence is mildly startling - those East End London accents!<br /><br />BUT Mr. Russell does not disappoint with this one - there's even a sly dig at Visconti's \\"Death in Venice\\", a reprise of the 'obsession' sequence - delightful.
0345440900|5.0|I was very disturbed at some reviews by \\"theorticians\\" who seemed to rail against the author and her advice.  I have a newborn son, so let my personal experience with the book be your guide.  I struggled with crying jags, poor sleep, and a relatively unhappy boy for 7 weeks.  I was given the book prior to my son's birth but did not read it then because I was inundated by pregnancy books.  <br />However, at week 7, I picked it up and read it in the middle of the night, hoping to get sleep-sleep-through the night suggestions.   I finished the book that night, and began applying the authors advice.  Literally overnight, my son was happier, and as a result, so was I.  We are at week 9 and he sleeps through the night easily.<br />Additionally, this is the ONLY book I read with practical advice for bottle-feeding mothers.  I despise the breastfeeding-nazis, who seem to feel their way is the only way.  Not true -- both my husband and myself were formula fed and turned out just fine.  I could not nurse my son, as a literally produced no milk (not uncommon in older mothers, despite the myth any woman can produce enough milk).  The author did not negate the benefits of breast feeding, but offered the alternative in a factual way.  Very refreshing.<br />This book will be the gift I give to any friend who is expecting. And I urge anyone who gets this book to read it BEFORE giving birth.

B00005R87Q|1.0|When visiting the Czech Republic, a Czech friend suggested that we see a movie together, and due to problems translating American movie titles, she took me to see \\"The Fast & the Furious\\" on accident. After a couple of hours, we - the entire audience - rolled out of the theatre laughing hysterically. (This is saying a lot - Czech theatre-goers tend to lap-up American action-adventure films.)<br />Though the special effects were impressive, the boys and girls were pretty, and the music was thumping, this was the single worst movie I've ever had the misfortune of seeing!<br />Don't get me wrong - I enjoy silly movies as much as the next guy - I recently saw the Austrian robot, Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his new movie, \\"Collateral Damage,\\" and I had a great time.<br />But please, give me a break: the FBI orders the LAPD to infiltrate a high-tech street-racing gang accused of freeway hijacking 18 wheelers using suped-up Honda Civics - the FBI's rationale is that they don't want the truckers \\"to take things into their own hands.\\" This is the REAL plot!<br />This movie gets a three groan rating!
0446608955|5.0|I read &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; twice--once before seeing the movie and once after, when I bought it.  I absolutely adore it.  It's such a beautiful, lasting story, and a fairly easy read.  After I read it, I handed it to my little sister and, with tears in my eyes, said, &quot;Read this.  It will change the way you look at life.&quot;  And that's exactly what it did to both of us.<br />Mr. Sparks, congratulations on your spectacular book.  I know I'll be reading it again.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I was anxious to see this movie, because Luhrman's Romeo & Juliet was simply stunning, but I was a bit skeptical at the casting of Ewan McGregor as Christian.  I suspected that Nicole Kidman would be fantastic, but did not have such high hopes for Ewan.  Surprisingly, I thought they were both fantastic.  They both demonstrate unbelievable range as actors.  The first 15 minutes of the movie are a bit jarring.  You really need to see the movie more than once to appreciate/assimilate it all.  But once the \\"story\\" begins, the movie flows like silk.  The only exception is one scene where Nicole Kidman is faking sexual attraction for Christian (who she believes is the Duke) while he reads poetry to her -- STINKY!  But otherwise, the movie is absolutely fantastic. One of the best scenes is where the song \\"Roxanne\\" is performed -- really cool and visually stunning.  A definite must-own.

0553277472|5.0|For those of you who have just joined us, this is a review of the book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;. It was written by Robert M. Pirsig. The book was published by HarperCollins Publishers. Mr. Pirsig also wrote &quot;Lila : an inquiry into morals&quot;. Anyways, now to the point.<br />If you are going to read this book, make sure you want to do some serious thinking. If it is big actions sequences that you are looking for; this is a direct hit.  However, the action doesn't play out on the pages, instead it is in your head.  <br />The book takes place on a trip Mr. Pirsig takes with his child and his friends (His son stays with him the entire time; however, his friends are only around for part of the book). During the trip he thinks of both his past, present, and future. Mr. Pirsig has had a very interesting life to say the least.  Pirsig spends much of the book using the motorcycle maintance analogy to relate to your life and how you take on certain tasks.  I guarentee this book will change the way you think.  I didn't say whether or not that was a good or a bad thing, but it will change the way you think.<br />Many people will find this book to be to dry. The book doesn't have much action as I said before. However, if you go into the book with an open mind you may get a lot out of it. The focal point of this book is your thinking about what is said, and really that would be the only problem.  If you don't feel like thinking there are a million other books out there.  But if you want to re-access the world around you, sort of put things into perspective, this is your book.<br />I think this book is well worth a look.  I was given a list of books to read by my professor and I chose this one (some of my friends had read it).  Basically, I know I made the right decision.  At first I was a bit weary.  I had only a couple days to go and I had barely gotten to the 100th page.  I started to turn on the book.  Then, in the middle of all my cramming,my view of &quot;when is this damn thing going to end&quot; suddenly changed to &quot;wow...this guy is right..&quot; and when the book ended suddenly seemed to be an imminent downer.  <br />When it did finally end I was very happy with my decision to read it and I highly recommend it.  I have already suggested it to a few of my friends and I plan to re-read it again shortly.
0761536434|4.0|An exhaustive account of the business of games, with plenty of inside information.  Not much theory or analysis about why any of it happened, but that's not important for the probable audience of this book.<br />If you want to know about how the various genres developed, this is not the book.  If you want to review the history of companies and remember some good old games, this one is great.

0345440803|5.0|Finally a sleep method that is working! After just one week of following the advice my 13 month old 'non-stop' nurser is FINALLY out of my bed and no longer fighting me all night to nurse. He still wakes, but now needs no more than a pat on the back to go back to sleep. We have a ways to go, but this book has given me the help I needed and in an easy to read, easy to follow format (very important when you are sleep deprived!!) ALSO, I feel as if Tracy Hogg knows my 2 1/2 year old inside out! I can't say enough about how her insight has helped me in the day to day dealings with a very high energy boy. I will recommend this book to everyone I know who has a toddler!
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I am getting sick and tired of movie critics and ignorant people. I did not see anywhere where it said &quot;based on a true story&quot;. Tis is a work of fiction. Fiction being the key word here. Meaning not based on actual facts. Yes parts of the movie were set to be authentic to the time period but not the premise, which was to capture the enigma machine. Yes there was one, and at the end of the movie right before the credits it gives credit to the actual boats that found it! This movie is meant to be entertaining, you want history watch discovery you morons. People go to the movies and rent movies to be entertained. They want to feel something, and for two hours they are not faced with the hardships of life. Their minds are no longer so focused on reality and for those brief two hours even we can be heroes. Movies are made to convey an emotion, a feeling. Not your mind to start wondering well, they were off about a few hundred years. Who cares. Next time, sit down, shut up and enjoy that time, don't get so wrapped up in whether they were accurate or not. This movie was great, it has everything a good movie requires. The story is great, the intense awesome and the photography state of the art. Cast was perfect for their roles.
B00005NKKV|4.0|What's it been now...35 years?  Well, something like that.  Yet this music still stirs and still intrigues new generations.  Of particular interest is the fact that the majority  of these songs are not considered to be among their &quot;greatest&quot; works.  But look what happens: we hear those great songs on the radio and listen to our CDs so much that we're tired of them.  That's when it's time to seek out the other songs, the lesser-known, but still  great, ones.  Songs like &quot;A Most Peculiar Man,&quot; &quot;Richard Cory,&quot; &quot;Roving Gambler,&quot; and &quot;Barbriallen.&quot;<BR>P.S. Check out the classic poem &quot;Richard Cory&quot; by Edward Arlington Robinson and other versions of the &quot;Barbriallen&quot; story, such as &quot;Jimmy Grove and Barbara Allen&quot; by the New Christy Minstrels.
6303168507|5.0|Having seen \\"Schindler's List\\" on PBS a couple of months ago, I was stunned at how Spielburg demonstrated how historically accurate this motion picture is. Filmed in gritty b/w, it is nevertheless the stunning, stark adaptation of how Oskar Schindler (superb job by Liam Neeson) has a change of heart and decides to save 1,000 Jews in ww2 Poland.<br />Fully deserving the Oscars and Oscar nominations it received, of which Liam Neeson rightfully deserved a Best Actor nomination, while the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars went to this outstanding motion picture and to Steven Spielburg.<br />This movie ranks at the top of the must-see Spielburg films, along with E.T. But avoid his latest films, such as A.I. Sure, A.I. has a good cast, but the superficial script and cheap-looking cinematography pales in comparison to this 1993 masterpiece and Spielburg's 1982 triumph, E.T.<br />Rated R for violence, nudity and for language.
B00001U0DP|1.0|Life is Beautiful is one of the biggest shams to hit the art houses in recent memory.  It poises itself to be a testament to the triumph of the human spirit and fails miserably.<br />First of all - I realize this film is not a documentary and it's intent is not to portray the holocaust in an accurate way.  However, there are certain things that should not be made light of.  The movie might as well have made cancer or slavery out to be on par with a day at the amusement park.  I don't care about accuracy here, but when Robert Benigni runs around pulling any hyjink he likes to make his son laugh, he denies the danger of the setting.  And we're not just talking about any setting.  This is something that is absolutely sacred and if people don't have a problem with that, I think they need to think a little harder about it.  I think using the holocaust as a setting was a cheap trick, an easy way to move people.  All these offenses aside, the movie plays like \\"Mr. Beene Goes to Auschwitz\\" with parent/child sentiment on par with a cough syrup commercial.
630575067X|2.0|\\"The Phantom Menace\\" is one of the possibly worst blockbusters of all time. First of all, it's cheap looking, without having a '70s to '80s feel, which would have given the \\"Phantom Menace\\" more authenticity to the credit of being a Star Wars prequel.<br />Second, the script and direction are shoddy. Sure, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are good in this, but the crass, overblown special effects bring the film down. Jar-Jar Binks seems to rule the film with his massive stupidity and his annoying Jamaican frog accent.<br />Third, the storyline is promising, but it's bogged down with the miscasting of Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker and the overrunning of special effects on the unnecessary pod race. <br />The movie and the actors are promising, but Lucas's inflated ego seems to be bogging down this film and the film seems more like a insult, rather than a tribute, to the great Star Wars films. Stick with the orginal trilogy instead and let's hope \\"Attack of the Clones\\" is significantly better than this shoddy piece of celluloid.
B0000509C4|5.0|I've seen both of the Creepshow movies, and they are both 2 of my favorite horror movies of all time. All stories were originated from the comic of the 50's and they were put into movie form just as great as &quot;Tales From The Crypt's Demon Knight&quot;, and many more. Creepshow 2 doesn't live up to the original, but they have some pretty cool stories, and my personal fave on this one was &quot;Old Chief Wood'nhead&quot;, but the other two were great stories, and fairly orignal. Don't expect  what you saw from the first film, but this is still a great movie.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead, the single most mysterious band in our world, have released in less then a year, their follow-up to the revolutionary Kid A. Many complain Amnesiac is boring and is their worst work to date. Others might regard this album as being better than Kid A or OK Computer. My opinion falls somewhere in between those other two I just have mentioned. I feel like this is a great album, however there are many bugs to work out on here. For example, the worst song on here has to be the reworked version of Morning Bell. Radiohead tried to make an already perfect song, an even more spiritual and uplifting song. They, in fact, have failed at that. The music on Amnesiacs Morning Bell, is extremely horrid and it makes Thom Yorkes great vocals seem as if he is blabbering. I often skip this track upon the times I listen to this release. I also find Hunting Bears to be very boring as well. Its an instrumental with basically one instrument, a guitar. The guitar solo is exceedingly borish and the only other piece of instrument we hear is the wind. However, with the many bugs I have mentioned, there are of course Amnesiacs fair share of spectacular songs. Of course, nobody on this earth can argue that Pyramid Song is one of the most beautiful songs on the earth. Its piano really intrigues any true music listener. Another great song I found enjoyable is Spinning Plates. The music on that song is very odd and considerably eerie. We also get treated to distorted vocals from Mr.Yorke, himself. Amnesiac is a good album. Its just I really cant say that they are going in a new direction. Amnesiac is just a mixture of their two best albums, OK Computer and Kid A. Im hoping that on their next effort they stay away from the stuff they did on Amnesiac and go on and make an album even more revolutionary than Kid A or OK Computer. If you are a fan of Radioheads work, than you should definetly buy Amnesiac. You might be dissapointed but not that bad. If you are interested in Radioheads music, get Amnesiac or Pablo Honey before you buy Kid A. Or if you could care less about Radiohead, Amnesiac is not a good way to make you turn around.
6305252521|2.0|This film has features akin to many mediocre science fiction films, in that it establishes an inherently interesting premiss, but fails to portray its protagonist as a credible, fully realised character.  Whatever 'journey' or development this character then undertakes seems obvious and almost inevitable, to the point of being unsatisfying.  The plot becomes similarly devoid of surprises.  Watching this might also be compared with viewing an 'escape' movie (i.e from a prison, or prisoner-of-war camp),  where very quickly you know where everything is headed - the pleasure then becomes that of the details, the mood, and unexpected insights into people's behaviour under stress (see 'Le Trou' for a classic example) - unfortunately, 'The Truman Show' is not strong on any of these counts.<BR>*<BR>Jim Carrey has a very limited talent.  He seems like a caricature of himself, every facial expression, every bodily gesture, being exaggerated.  This is fine for generating a certain kind of humour (Jerry Lewis did something similar), but it seems less than ideal as a technique for evincing audience empathy.  His casting here is regrettable.  I can imagine people leaping to his defence, but just imagine if this film starred an actor capable of rendering a complex personality, a personality riven with conflicting emotions and desires, rather than the 'one-emotion-at-a-time' style of Carrey - think Jeff Bridges (who appeared in Weir's 'Fearless'), or if you want go for broke, a young Marlon Brando.<BR>*<BR>What is more (or less), every other character is limited in depth and humanity.  Ed Harris, blank-faced veteran of such unreflective films as 'The Firm' and 'Apollo 13', gives a one, or possibly two, dimensional performance as producer turned god (perhaps this is forgivable as humanity has never been a notable quality of producers or gods).<BR>*<BR>Weir is at his best being suggestive.  'The Last Wave' is brilliant in this regard.  He's great at certain brooding atmospheres - seealso 'Witness', or 'Picnic at Hanging Rock'.  Here, however, he is being didactic (tediously so) and the atmosphere is cheesy grins and half-baked sentimentalism - not his, or anyone else's,  forte.<BR>*<BR>So, be careful with this film.  It seems to have scored high marks with the critics, and technicians such as 'script doctors', because it is 'more intelligent' than the average Hollywood product - well, yes, but when you're talking 'Hollywood' and 'intelligence' then you're talking about a very low average.  <BR>*<BR>My vote for a truly great contemporary American film goes to David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive'.
B00005BL2A|2.0|I read once that Martin Gore had a serious case of writer's block when creating songs for Exciter, and you know what? It shows. This album is full of lyrical retreads Sweetest Condition= Sweetest Perfection, Shine= One Caress, and Breathe= Things You've Said.  In addition, the lyrics are trite as shown with  When the Body Speaks. Musically, Exciter lacks edge. The musical arrangements are flat and bland. There are no dynamics, texture to the songs. In a word, boring.
0316926345|4.0|It's surprising to see a relatively serious novel like \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" from Evelyn Waugh, whose reputation as a writer was built on humor.  It confronts a difficult theme -- the disintegration of a once-noble British family by two world wars and changes in the social and moral fabric of the first half of the twentieth century.  But Waugh handles the material with the aplomb of a natural storyteller and the objectivity of an observer who is wise enough never to become too symphathetic with his characters.<br />\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is narrated in flashback through the voice of a British Army captain named Charles Ryder, who one day in 1943 inadvertently finds himself near an estate called Brideshead which he recognizes as a place he'd first seen twenty years before.  His memories take us directly back to 1923 when he was a freshman at Oxford and befriended a fellow student named Lord Sebastian Flyte.  Sebastian is pampered, effeminate, and abnormally juvenile; he spends more time drinking than studying and owns a teddy bear.  Now, I realize that it's not absurd for a grown man to own a teddy bear, but it is when he frequently refers to the bear by its christened name, treats it as a confidant, and brings it with him on outings.  With Sebastian, Charles finds himself moving in a new social circle, illuminated by the even more flamboyantly effeminate and sexually ambiguous Anthony Blanche.   <br />Sebastian is secretive about his family but nevertheless takes Charles to visit the family house at Brideshead.  Eventually Charles does get to meet Sebastian's sisters Julia and Cordelia, his older brother the Earl of Brideshead, and his (separated) parents, Lord and Lady Marchmain.  It's apparent that Sebastian dislikes his family, especially his pious Catholic mother; his excessive drinking is a means to escape his unhappiness.  Charles, meanwhile, sort of adopts this family as his own and becomes intimately involved in their affairs; his own father -- his only close living relative -- is somewhat of a doddering old fool and not much good company.<br />Over the following years, the characters grow and develop as all good characters should.  Julia marries a budding politician named Rex Mottram, who makes a comically clumsy attempt at conversion to Catholicism before the wedding; Charles becomes an artist and starts an affair with Julia during a stormy Atlantic crossing; the Earl collects matchboxes; Cordelia, the most conscientious of the Flytes, becomes a humanitarian aid worker.  Sebastian, who is so central early in the novel, gradually falls out of the picture; years of idleness, apathy, irresponsibility, and debauchery lead him to a miserable existence in northern Africa.<br />There is significance in Charles's chosen profession -- that of an artist who paints architectural portraits of ancient English manors -- because it parallels his role as historian and chronicler of the decadent Flyte family; he gives the impression of a curator proudly showing a portrait of a stately old house or family and saying, \\"This was once a great monument of England.\\"  \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is not an outright funny novel like \\"Scoop\\" (although there is an amusing cross-reference to the Beast, the newspaper from \\"Scoop\\"), but it is still filled with Waugh's wry charm and his effortlessly mellifluous prose.

B00004Z4WR|2.0|The Sticky doesn't really understand this movie.  I mean what's the point in stealing all those bags of rice? You can just get them at your local supermarket.
0385505833|3.0|O-kay, let's be honest.  This book is not going to win any literary awards, but that doesn't mean it lacks charm.  Take the book for what it's worth....a very short, semi-charming, little Christmas tale.  I laughed at cranky Luther, could associate the goody-goody neighbors with people I know, and although the book lacks character depth, in the end you get a little lesson of the &quot;meaning&quot; of the holidays.  I wouldn't pay 20 bucks for the book, but wouldn't mind a trip to the library for it.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Originally a comic book strip, Akira was transferred to the big screen and the results are frightening but beautiful.  It tells the tale of addiction of the Sticky Rice and the consequences of eating too much of it.  You either end up like Tetsuo, deforming yourself into a big disgusting Sticky Rice or end up like those three little kids and get the crap beaten out of you all the time.<br />A tale of for the ages and should be shown to all hawker food owners and yum cha restaurateurs.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Scary movie! The gushing reviews should be your warning...<BR>I thought it was going to be my kind of movie, but the only high-point was reached when the Fox intro was accompanied by a conductor with flailing arms in the first few seconds.  It went steadily downhill from there. Good for a cinematography Oscar perhaps, but the movie was all-dressed-up with nowhere to go and nothing to say.  God help us if this is the new musical style for the 21st Century.
B00000G3PA|2.0|The Sticky actually liked the premise of this story.  A huge ball of Sticky Rice is hurling towards the earth and a bunch of misfit hawker food operators are forced in the task of saving earth from this impending disaster.  But unfortunately it kind of goes downhill from there.  As everyone knows, the way to stop a ball of Sticky Rice from smashing earth to bits is to actually dress up the earth as a big trolley tray fill with all sorts of yum cha snacks.  Then the ball will just scurry away in fright.  But the americans do it in their typical way, blow the thing up and ask questions later.  Ho hum.<br />The most devilish thing about this movie though is Ben Affleck's sick laugh - the showing of the gums and teeth - truly frightening.  It's right up there with Arnold Schwarzenegger's sick laugh.
0553277472|5.0|What begins as a fairly harmless seeming story becomes more and more of an intellectual adventure as the protagonist rides through America on his motorcycle and shares current thoughts and fragments of his former life. A classic!
B00003CXE7|4.0|Being a champion of the Sticky Rice, Ridley Scott (who made the seminal RiceRunner and the haunting Black Rice) embarked on the true history of the Rice in Europe.  And he didn't disappoint.<br />It tells of a head chef, played with great aplomb by Russell Crowe, who is part of the Roman empire's quest to spread pasta throughout Europe. After banishing the upstart Germans and their sausages, Russell wants to return home to and start up a hawker store and introduce the Sticky Rice to his local community (and Laksa as well - he loves his chilli).<br />However the young upstart emperor, played with a maniacal hongkie zeal by Joaquin Phoenix has other ideas.  He wants to open up a new chain of restaurants where waiters are put into a ring and have to cook up a plate of pasta while dodging drunk lions, belligerent Zulus and other restaurant competitors who want to steal their recipe.  And so Russell is thrust into it!<br />There are great waitering action sequences here.  Witness Russell and his band of waiters cook up a plate of Fettuccine Bosialoa while dodging fish and chips from the English and tacos from the Mexicans.  However the supreme moment is when Russell is near death and what it looks like,to be maggots festering in his wound.  For all aficionado's of the Rice, we know that it was actually sticky rice pouring out of his body to heal the wound.  Full marks must go to Ridley for daring to reveal the secrets of the Sticky Rice sect and exposing the trials and tribulations of the first hawker food owners in Europe.<br />Just a side note, while filming in Morocco, Ridley Scott actually<br />introduced the Sticky Rice to the local cuisine.  The community devoured it.  They now have developed their own Sticky Rice - has a dash of sand in it.  Believe me, might sound a bit funky but it gives it a nice<br />crunchy flavour.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters. I thought it'd be okay and a fun movie to see as the other two were. I was wrong. This movie was awesome! The effects were pretty good and the movie was more funny than the other two. It has it's serious moments, but what I enjoyed was actually laughing quite a bit in a Jurassic Park movie. I also loved the fact they brought back Ellie and Grant. Ellie should've had a bigger part, but Grant pretty much covered it okay. I hope this is the last JP movie, because one more might ruin this great trilogy. A funny, exciting movie that you'll enjoy over and over again.
B00000JGHM|4.0|&quot;eat nothing that you cannot drop in 5 minutes when you spot the<br />sticky rice on the yum cha trolley&quot;<br />The Sticky would whole heartedly agree with this statement as he watched in absolute fascination as Bob and his chopstick welding crew prepared to rob the biggest cache of rice grains.  On their tail is Al, a hard nose cop with a heart of rice.<br />It's a fine line these actors tread in showing what the Sticky Rice really means.  Watch out for unforgettable shootout scene when Bob and crew fight their way out of a horde of hawker food owners scrambling to recover the precious rice.  And witness the tragic suicide attempt by Natalie Portman as she tries to stuff herself with Swei Mai.  It's all delicately directed by the main man himself, Michael Mann, who created such classics as RiceHunter, The Last of the Stick Rice and the Noodle.
B00004U8JV|3.0|Sorry to say, but this is my least favorite out of the 3 JP movies. I like that they brough Malcom back, and the effects were alright, but the movie itself was...not as good as it could've been. But on the good-side my favorite scene out of all the JP's were in it. The one where the raptors stalk them in the fields. Sure the T-Rex in the first one was cool and the Spino AND raptors were awesome in the third, but nothing beats the Raptor Chase in The Lost World:Jurassic Park. You should watch it but don't be too excited. I'd rent it first.
0060930187|5.0|Sticky can't help but view poor Esther Greenwood as merely a product of that particular cultural milieu of New England in the 1950's. Asian influences were hardly prevalent and frankly a warm sticky rice as a comfort food was an anachronism and anathema to most WASPish tastes. Sticky believes that in this modern age Esther's problems could be easily solved with a few brisk slaps to the cheek and a steamer full of rice on the stove...
B00004U8JU|5.0|Who'd ever thought that bringing dinosaurs back to life could be so cool? A must see for anyone. It'll scare you, make you laugh, and make you actually think. Yes, this is a great movie!!
B00005UEAR|2.0|First of all, I'd like to explain that the 2 star rating is not a general rating. As far as a general album, Six Degrees is better than a lot of music that we're forced to listen to on the radio. However, as a Dream Theater album, this was a real let down. I've been a Dream Theater fan since 1992 when Images and Words came out. Awake was an awesome album, Seasons and Infinity were not as good but enjoyable albums all the same, but Metropolis 2 didn't quite meet my expectations. Six Degrees just took a big dive into musical indifference, and I can't help but feel a little insulted at the same time thinking that the band would give an album like this to their fans. No song on this album really stuck out, nothing as memorable as The Mirror, Scarred, Metropolis 1, or even A Change of Seasons. Nothing even comes close.<br />Many of the songs are too lengthy, which used to be a good thing and unnoticable on previous albums, but with Six Degrees I find myself getting agitated waiting for the song to end. A lot of the keybords solos sound a little cheesy at times, and none of the guitar parts have any soul. I just can't help but wonder what happened to the band I once thought could change the face of music. Stick to all albums up until Falling into Infinity. Maybe someday Dream Theater will come back around.
B000002HIK|5.0|This album is truly amazing. I am usually VERY critical about albums, I spend hours in the CD shop deciding which one to get. When I heard this, I was lost for words.<br />I discovered Aphex Twin a couple of years ago, but only bought one of his albums a little while ago. That was the Richard D. James album. After many listens (it's hard to digest at first) it became a huge favourite.<br />\\"Which other album of his shall I buy now?\\" I asked myself. I read the reviews and listened to the samples of I Care Because You Do and I wanted it immediately. When I heard the music on this album, it grabbed me like no other music had before. Does anyone else get the feeling when the music \\"pulls a string\\" inside you? Well, almost all of the ones on here did for me. It refreshes your soul and uplifts you and puts your ears in heaven, all at the same time. Music doesn't get finer than this.<br />From when the album starts right through till it finishes, it will captivate you. I'll describe the album to give you an idea of its contents...<br />It is definitely IDM and it has a lot of happy, dark but beautiful orchestrated stuff (violins and stuff) put to sometimes laid-back and sometimes very fast and rhythmical beats. It's a lot more mature in comparison to the RDJ album and the songs are much more emotional. As some reviewers have said, certain songs could make you cry with happiness and sadness and other emotions you won't have felt before.<br />However, watch out for track 5. At first you will hate it because it is SO painful on the ears, but after a few attempts you will ignore the screeching sound and listen to the music behind. <br />The album as a whole will take you on an incredible journey that will leave you feeling completely blown away. It is a truly wonderful experience.<br />I hope this review has helped you, because I think everyone in the world should have a copy of this CD it is so amazing. Thank you everyone and thank you Richard D James!
B00005JKED|5.0|it was pretty good movie, though...showed not all policeman are honest and the consequences of being bad cop...
6304935811|5.0|My dad and I saw this when it was first released. Dad said &quot; G.C.Scott didn't just play Patton; he was Patton&quot;. We have worn out two copies because we watch it all the time. Thank God for DVDs the extras are fanatastic. If you've never seen it, you should. My only regret is that it can only get five stars-this deserves more.
B00005QDW5|2.0|It would take most of us more than a thousand words to sum up the mystique and brilliancy of Pink Floyd's music, much less cram it into two CD's. If in fact their 1994 album \\"The Division Bell\\" (Pink Floyd's only studio release in eight years) was their last offering, then the compilation \\"Echoes\\" was released at relatively the right time in their history. But if in fact the band plans to release another studio album, then this rather uninspired best-of package has disoriented the band's lexicon a bit.<br />Though it is full of thirty years' worth of great music, \\"Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd\\" is no different from most other compilation albums. It's full of material we already own, but...gasp!...there's one previously unreleased song, in this case, 'When the Tigers Broke Free,' from the 1982 film adaption of \\"The Wall.\\" Another thing that makes \\"Echoes\\" similar to other compilations is that the track selection is very predictable, using what the critics say are the most memorable of their repertoire. Almost a third of the tracks on \\"Echoes\\" have already been included on previous compilations. Though in some cases, some tracks are merely album fillers, such as the unlisted excerpt from 'Bring the Boys Back Home,' (before 'Comfortably Numb') and especially 'The Happiest Days of Our Lives,' which was obviously included because it provided a clear segue for 'Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)' (though the radio mix available on the 1981 compilation \\"A Collection of Great Dance Songs\\" would have worked). Add one star for producer James Guthrie's craft of using marvelous sound techniques to segue each song to the next, and for Storm Thorgeson's unique artwork.<br />It's rather sad to see such a wonderful band as Pink Floyd give in to the obligatory and uninspired notion of a best-of release.
0767802659|4.0|This film pushes the style of Robocop, one of the director's earlier movies, into the realm of full-blown black comedy and satire.  If you've ever wondered whether Americans are brainwashed by propaganda, this film offers a chilling answer.  I'm not sure why humans are so susceptable to patriotic blather, and why they can be so easily convinced that someone is their enemy, but this film does a good job of letting you recognize such tendencies in yourself.  It doesn't matter who started the war, why the war was started, or how it will end.  Once we're in a war, we are extraordinarily susceptable to the suggestion that we are right and just--and that the ends justify the means.  And as you watch the \\"brain\\" creature get prepared for experimental surgery, a number of chilling analogies come to mind.  No doubt, we as a species are more than capable of horrific brutality portrayed in this film.  It is \\"The Will to Power\\" for the Twentieth (and now Twenty-First) Century.  Entertaining.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever.  Vin and Paul are great and the car races rock!!!  A must see!!!
B00005KHJR|5.0|This is a movie that triggers rather firm reactions--you either love it or you think its corny.  I think its one of coolest and most engrossing movies ever made.  I did not see the ending coming, and found it to be among the most disturbing films I had ever seen.  Now, there are parts that I suppose seem a little silly to some--Christopher Lee singing a ballad to a snail comes to mind--but I frankly enjoyed those moments.  You just need to listen to the words.  There happens to be a lot there.  The movie, at its heart, portrays well how people can be absolutely certain about very different religious \\"truths,\\" and that religion and the impulse to worship can be treacherous stuff.  For the lead character, it poses the question, \\"Do you really have the courage of your convictions?\\"  For the rest--we'll they'll just have to wait and see whether the gods will be good to them.  After all, there's always another year and another ...  Anyway, you ought to watch it, if for no other reason than to see a young Britt Eklund prance naked in a primitive erotic dance.
B00005JKQX|5.0|The most compelling movie I have ever seen.  Ron Howard at his best.  Eight acadamy award nominations is not enough.  I have seen it twice and plan to go again.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Maybe. But this is a somewhat pleasant and unimaginatively flat movie--not the enthralling adventure that some reviewers would have you believe. First, it lacks the dark humor which gave the book life--the Roald Dahl-style sensibility that made you actually indentify with Harry. This movie has little sense of humor at all--and what it has is canned, pure and simple. Second, this film evinces an attitude that all that you really need to be an actor is to be very British. I guess. To be sure, Robbie Coltrane is fine in his role as a feeble-minded giant with a heart of gold, but a better script could have catapolted his role even higher. The kid who plays Harry is entirely unengaging. He brings none of the sly vulnerability to the role that would have made him interesting. Instead, he is this rather bland kid with glasses who effortlessly glides through a plot which cannot produce a single moment of convincing danger. Harry, in other words, is coated in teflon and a bullet-proof suit in this movie--never once do we think any harm is even remotely on the horizon. And if there is no danger, can there be effective drama in a picture like this? No. Halfway through, I found myself looking at my watch. If you think I'm wrong, then you probably haven't seen the Lord of the Rings, which does everything right that Harry does wrong.
B00003IPFK|5.0|My all time favorite movie.  This is the best western ever made.  A great love story with lots of horses and adventure.  I have watched this movie at least 20 times and I never get tired of it.  I always cry when Gus dies.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Perhaps giving this movie two stars was a bit harsh.  But, I couldn't bring myself to give it three.  No way.  It's just too boring.  This is a movie that is truly sleep-inducing.  The plot is a muddle--trade federations, knights fighting on behalf of commerce, a race here, a race there, muddle, muddle, seven large, indisinguishable underwater monsters, etc.  Even my 11-year old couldn't stay up through it when we saw for the second time (the pain, the pain) on pay-per-view.  I truly love the original Star Wars trilogy.  But those films were good in all the ways this film isn't.  A true fairy tale story form, great acting turns by the entire cast, energy and enthusiasm, and a great set of villains.  The worst thing about this film?  The AWFUL kid who plays the young Darth Vader.  You'd think after an hour of filming they'd have dumped him.  Hmmm.  He must be related to George Lucas.  Rent it if you must, but no need to buy the darn thing.
B00005AFVR|4.0|Having seen the shows in Paris and Cologne this is a fine document of the exciting shows Springsteen gave together with the E Street Band. Together with live 1975-1985 you will have the best music of The Boss in your collection.<BR>Please skip the live album without the E Street Band. It's the combination of Springsteen and the E Street Band that makes it all this special.
B000051VWW|5.0|I can't imagine a better gift for a spouse or lover.  I waited too long for this CD.  I overplayed &quot;It's No Ordinary Love&quot; and it now haunts me. As soon as this CD was released I bought it, and it is better than I ever imagined. A perfect mood for bathing, making love, driving in the rain, or telling someone, &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot;.  Women (and men) can somtimes be a pain to shop for, trying to find that perfect gift. Look no further. I walked into my candle-lit house and heard this playing on my CD player. It remains in my mind as one of the most romantic surprises I ever received.  If you have never heard Sade's voice...it will sooth, calm, and seduce you.  She has a jazzy quality that is classic and so pleasing to the senses you can easily fall asleep to her music.  I feel relaxed just thinking about it.

0792101448|5.0|It's rare that you find a motion picture film where characters are given their own themes.  This is one of those rare treats.  With an opera score, Leone achieves a pinnacle of cinematographical architecture.  Even the scenes complained about as being tedious and long have achieved their purpose - to make the viewer experience the tedium the characters experience!  Leone is truly a master of utilizing the camera as a character of the story, a technique which so many in Hollywood seem to not understand.<br />This is not a film to be watched as the exposition of an interesting plot with entertaining dialog and catchy one-line retorts.  One would not view a Monet exhibit and comment on being able to see the brushstrokes, nor would one listen to Beethoven and complain that there are too few instruments.  This film should be treated similarly.
0767002652|5.0|When television was reaching for the stars this series which lasted 5 years was like a rocketship in the anals of entertainment. Thirty years later it is still totally absorbing, sophisticated, and fun to watch. It is a classic that my husband and I re-visited recently over a period of several months. If you missed Upstairs Downstairs in the '70's don't miss it now if you can help it. A combination of a British soap opera, classical drama and comedy, we got totally involved in the family upstairs, and the second family of servants, downstairs. It's a hoot.
B000002ADT|5.0|You've read 340 glowingly positive reviews of this and you're STILL not convinced?  Go out right now and buy a copy of this.  Who am I to review one of the most influential jazz recordings of all time?  I'm nobody!  You just have to go get it immediately and see why everyone likes it so much.<br />The 1997 CD re-release is quite extraordinary.  Great pains were taken to restore the clarity and fullness of the sound, even correcting the pitch from the original release, which was off due to a tape machine running at the wrong speed.  This recording is an improvement on the original.<br />What, are you still reading?
B000002HMH|2.0|I bought this album \\"on faith\\"- been a fan from the early 80's and enjoyed their albums as they progressed.  As I began listening to it I kept thinking ( and hoping ) that the best stuff is either:  Later in the album - or - of the classic Metallica \\"start off slow and build to a fury\\" variety.  Such was not to be...It's all slow, plodding and listless.  Hetfieled's profuse, angst-ridden \\"toughman\\" growls are no substitute for the meaty and precise riffs that made Metallica...well...Metallica- a well as a kick to listen to.  -  The old 'cognative dissonance' began to haunt me:  It's not \\"bad\\" on its own merits or as a genric 90's hard-ish rock CD ... and that's just what I told myself to keep me from thinking I was a sucker for buying it without hearing it first.  I wonder if the same feeling occured to others-  you know; \\"Did I buy it because I like it...Or...Do I \\"like\\" it because I already bought it?  --  I guess the simple explanation is that the 80's and the 90's just don't mix.  Metallica should've let 'Creed', 'Pearl Jam' or Nickcleback' carry the torch for plodding, generic, \\"alternative\\" music...as at least those bands are what they are, and do it well.
6305546789|5.0|This movie is the classic horror film that even today sends chills down some people's spine! You would think it is just another slasher film but it's not because without this film the slasher genre would not have became as big as it is today. John Carpenter is a genius for making this film! It is his best! It also has better acting than other slasher films. Friday the 13th or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or A Nightmare on Elm Street don't even compare to this masterpiece! It even has a really good score! This and The Believers are my two favorite horror films and I think they always will be, at least this one anyway. If you havn't seen this film yet see it and see what you think. This masterpiece deserves 5 stars!
B000005JFG|5.0|FORE! was one of the first rock tapes I ever owned, and I played it so much that after 7 years it was worn out, and even today on CD, it ranks among my favorites. It's very rare that I can let an album play start to finish without finding a song I'm not crazy about, but FORE! is an honest-to-goodness pop-in, crank-up, and sing-along collection of songs.<br />\\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is a deserving kick-off song with its even blend of drums, keys, and guitar, followed by the mellow, engaging love song \\"Stuck With You\\". \\"Whole Lotta Lovin'\\" speeds up the pace by Huey's funny lyrics punctuated in the middle by his reminder \\"I'm the one with the harmonica!\\" One of Huey's most unforgettable ballads is presented in signature style with \\"Doin'It All For My Baby\\", though it's made even more appealing by its hysterical video. The same must be said of \\"Hip To Be Square\\", another simple rock tune (a la \\"Workin' For A Livin') driven by lyrics, particularly the catchy title.<br />The second side, while lesser known, has more than its share of musical gems. \\"I Know What I Like\\" is another up-tempo number that isn't easy not to sing with, while \\"I Never Walk Alone\\", is driven by danceable guitar and piano work. \\"Forest For The Trees\\" is almost an undiscovered single (along the lines of \\"If This Is It\\") the lyrics and music equally memorable. \\"Naturally\\" is a fun, doo-wopping acapella number, and the album closes out on the heavy horn-sectioned \\"Simple As That\\", which the listener won't want to end.<br />All in all, There isn't a bad song to be found on FORE!, which is hard to say about any album released back then, and next to impossible with the albums coming out today. This is truly Huey & the News's best album, and any fan who doesn't have it in their collection is missing out. Seriously, all those who love straight-ahead, just-for-fun Rock N'Roll, this one is FORE you!

0060930187|5.0|I've read several books concerning young women who have fallen into mental depression or instability. Plath's book rose high above the rest, offering such an uninhibited insight a young woman's unsure world that I was blown away. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
0060931671|2.0|Though I admire Pynchon as a monumental writer in postmodern American literature, I must say that reading The Crying of Lot 49 was anything but relaxing. I truly admire Pynchon's clever wit and humor, but the symbolism and references hidden behind every other word made me feel absolutely exhausted. I would still recommend this book, but only to someone who is up for a deep, mind-twisting read - not for a soothing novel for the tub.
0553106635|5.0|This being the third book in the series really superised me. I was not expecting things to happen the way they do. You get to know the characters so well by the descriptions of the events as they unfold, it is very easy to get lost in the realm that has been created. I am looking forward to the next two books to see how this whole story continues to grow and will be sad when there is no more to read. Congratulations to George R R Martin for a grand and timeless story.
B000000I0H|5.0|I bought and nearly wore out the original Tubular Bells album.  Much as I love Tubular Bells, Incantations took my breath away.  It's pushing 25 years, and thousands of playings for me, but Incantations is still wonderful.  As far as I'm concerned, this music is as close to perfection as a human can get.
B000002H72|5.0|Every time I listen to this album, I am newly amazed. It's not just that the songs are so simply constructed but clever beyond words. It's not that there's nothing I'd want on a road trip more. The thing that gets me the most is its *presence*. Listening to it now, I can only imagine if I had been old enough to really appreciate it when it came out. This was 1989! Where did this come from? Out of absolutely nowhere came songs like the perfectly-poppy &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; and the perfectly-punky &quot;Gouge Away.&quot; But if I may digress for a moment, I have to mention &quot;Hey,&quot; a terribly unrrated song on this album. Simply put, there is no song sung by a man that turns me on... save for this one. The raw emotion with which Frank Black (or his alter ego Black Francis) wails &quot;Ugh... is.... the... SOOOOOOOOOOOOUND&quot; makes me get in accidents... quite literally, actually. And then his sensitive, raw, pain-filled lilting of &quot;We're chained...&quot;<br />Get this album.<br />NOW!
0375507507|4.0|I was also struck by the mixed reaction to this wonderful book.  I am also amused at how easily we use the words rascist and racism - almost like food labels, salt or pepper?<br />The one star folks are made uncomfortable by the book.   They see it as presenting a piece of the African story they had rather not imagine.  They miss the point.<br />Ms. Fuller's book, a sort of Angela's Ashes mixed with Out of Africa, is enjoyable because it is not judgemental or romanticized.  It is the story of a family's life with all the warts and blemishes.  It is funny, sad, shocking, heroic, amazing, eccentric, and at time unsettling.  Hurray for her.

0385505833|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from Grisham, with this work being very different than his usual writing. But I couldn't put it down as I found it to be very exciting and funny. It flows very well from one paragraph to the next, and from one chapter to the next. I was really curious to find out how one family would try to avoid the Christmas celebrations. A great and light read, if you just want to get away from the everyday hubbub.
B000002L9Y|5.0|This was the last Mac album from the \\"Rumours\\" lineup. It is a tightly cohesive album, and when I first listened to it, I was not a fan of Fleetwood Mac (yet), but a few of the songs sounded familiar to me. So, in other words, this is the album that brought me to like Fleetwood Mac. It is my personal favorite. Just like one of the other reviewers said, \\"this is a dreamy record\\". And it is. The title track is absolutely awesome and is breathtaking and it transports you to a quiet jungle of your own, and that guitar solo at the end is great! \\"Seven Wonders\\" is a fantasy like song, and is unforgettable, and it was co-written by Stevie Nicks' friend Sandy Stewart. Stevie made up some of the lyrics while she was recording along with the song. It is most likely my all-time favorite Mac song. \\"Welcome To The Room...Sara\\" is a diary of her experience to the Betty Ford Center the year before, and \\"When I See You Again\\" is touching but her voice is very shaky. Christine McVie is absolutly great on this album. Her stellar voice soars over her beautiful songs like \\"Everywhere\\" and the highly catchy \\"Little Lies\\". \\"Mystified\\" is a soothing and relaxing song, and \\"Isn't It Midnight\\" is one of the harder rocking songs on this album. \\"Big Love\\" is a good showcase for Lindsey Buckingham to show off his guitar playing, and it has one of the best videos of the 80's to accompany it. \\"Caroline\\" is a simple song, and Christine's little indian chant is probably the best part of the song. \\"Family Man\\" is just a weird song, but Lindsey has always written some of the groups more odd songs. \\"You & I, Pt. II\\" is a catchy little number, and it seems to be about the end of a relationship, and it's counterpart \\"You & I, Pt. 1\\" seems to be about the beginning of a relationship. It would be great if the record company re released this album with some of the great b-sides to the singles from this album were mixed in with the rest of the songs that were originally on here, because even some of thoseare better than some of the songs on the album, like \\"You & I, Pt. 1\\", \\"Book Of Miracles\\", \\"Ricky\\", and the Roy Orbison sound alike, \\"Down Endless Street\\". It would make the album (even though it is already great) even greater, and it would expand the album from 12 songs to about 16 songs. But I really do love this album, it is just great. It is good Fleetwood Mac, and you can't deny it.
0553106635|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy/sci-fi as an adolescent but gave up on the genre due to all the cornball dialogue and inane plotting.  Books that struck my fancy were few and far between and can be boiled down to The Lord of the Rings, Dune, and The White Gold Wielder stories.  However, on those aforementioned rare occasions when I was lifted away, I remember feeling such gratitude toward the author for taking me there.  And now I feel that same feeling for Mr. Martin.  There was actually a scene in Storm of Swords where I screamed bloody hell and was almost ready to give up on the book because I CARED SO MUCH for the characters, I couldn't bear to see them wronged.  I was upset at Mr. Martin for he'd succeeded in hypnotizing me, but I forgave him after I read the next chapter and remembered what a treat it all was.  I even began speaking in much the old english dialect of the book (in my mind, mind you) and thinking of things like portcullises, nasty puddings, and jousting tournaments (will I actually bring myself to go to a renaissance festival now, I wonder).<br />I am somewhat loathe to analyze this book too much, for it is just pure fun, but a couple of the manifold things Mr. Martin does right are:<br />A)  Captures the vernacular.  The characters snipe at each other using not only the correct lingo, they use the correct concepts.  Fast food culture is melted away.<br />B)  Deep knowledge of history.  Everything from siegecraft to court jesters are brought to life in the way only someone who knows his subject intimately can do.<br />C)  Great characters.  People ring true.  Little things like the boy king whose favorite part of his job is to stamp his seal on the letters written for him.  Or much, much bigger things such as the probing of Tyrion's mind.  At first I was thinking, great, a lame dwarf character, but Tyrion's shrewdness soon wins you over and you forget, am I rooting for the noble, sullen Starks, or am I pulling for the their incestual, cruel foes?  Tyrion, along with Jaime's (oh,so surprising)development (where's this character going, you wonder...), gives the brutal Lannisters terrific depth.  This is not just good characterization for a fantasy story, it's characterization worthy of any NOVEL.<br />D)  Intricate plotting.  From the relations of a hundred high bred families whose names you'll amazingly come to know (burn in hell, Freys), to rivers and hills that make up Westeros, it's all there to be thrown together in a wonderful stew.<br />As for faults, yes, there are a few, but it doesn't matter because everything is working so well.  It's much like the old Cosby show.  Once Bill Cosby started to make you laugh, he could say something non-amusing, but you were still rolling somehow because you wanted to.  Mr. Martin makes you want to.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is overall a better album than Make Yourself, and IMO Incubus' best so far. Make Yourself had some better songs on it than this one. You won't hear &quot;The Warmth&quot; or &quot;Pardon Me&quot; or anything rivaling those classics on here; however is this is a more solid consistent piece of work overall, full of absolutely great songs. <br />The whole album is quite good, but these are the absolutely PERFECT highlights:<BR>&quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;11AM&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Are You In&quot;. These also show the softer side of Incubus, but if you're looking for heavy fun loud rock energy, &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; is the best example.<BR>These just have such complicated impressive musicianship on it.<br />One thing i don't understand is why everyone loves &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; so much. It's a good song, but probably my least favorite on here. <br />All in all, if you are looking for good modern music with a heavy edge, that mixes rock and funky dj-work, then pick up Morning View. It's damn good music.
B00004TLMC|3.0|The title of this movie is adequate,you have to watch it with your eyes wide shut to appreciate it.I can't beleive that CRUISE and KIDMAN got involved in this mess.Slow moving,pretentious and boring to say the least.Who really cares about those dreams and the way the couples try to cope with their potential infidelities?The ending if you are patient enough to get there tops it;they must make love to redeem themselves.Oh yeah!One gets the feeling that with the death of the director during the filming,they simply could not find a way to find a coherence with the project.One of the sexless sex movie ever made.Think of it,maybe i missed the point.Forget it.If you get through this,you should receive a medal of tolerance.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Thom York likes to push random keys on a keyboard while wailing like a cat who is being strangled. \\"Pyramid ...ahem...'song'\\" proves this. (Man, i hate that one.) There's other pointless stuff on here too. Hell this whole album comes off as \\"Outtakes from Kid A\\".<br />Some of the songs on here are OK, but nothing special unique or original. And then there's \\"Knives Out\\" which is really nice, but basically a ripoff of Paranoid Android. <br />However, this is over all an experimental album, with a lot of attempts at a sound that is out of the ordinary. And there are some examples where it actually succeeds! <br />For example \\"Revolving Doors\\", \\"You and Whose Army\\", \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" and \\"Living in a Glass House\\" i think are AMAZING.<BR>But as expected, this album is mostly just a bunch of weirdness.
6305313687|5.0|I always enjoy Edward Norton movies, and I think he is one of the best actors of today.  This movie proves it.  He basically plays two different characters, because it is one person at two very different times in his life.  Each one he portrays brilliantly.  At times of his past life he scares and shocks you, while when he is older you feel compasion for him.  This movie was also a eye opening look into racism and ganglife in America, and had an excelent story with a suprising ending.  It is definitley one of my favorites, and if you haven't had a chance to see it, go now!
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is one of the best comedies, ever.<br />Its hilarity is often surpassed by its proximity to realism, which makes this movie ten times funnier.<br />I can't really say anything that hasn't been said before, but I would just like to add that if you somehow don't like Office Space, you probably drive a Porsche, have your own parking space, and wear suspenders. Fudgepacker.
B0000029GA|5.0|Oh god this is some real good hip-hop right here. I got this Hot album today at my local best buy and I am so happy about buying this it kicks serious ass. My favorite songs on this record are One love and Halftime I saw the video for one love a couple of weeks ago on Bet and i was like damn this album must be in my collection. Note to parents if you have a young nas fan don't buy him this it doesn't have a clean version and it is extremly dirty. Other than that buy this now if you don't have it.
B00003CXXP|3.0|AI is a good movie, and it deserves some credit for that. Spielberg deserves some credit for making a movie that seems to follow Kubrick's vision. <BR>However, AI is too long. The plot gets ridiculous after the boy gets frozen in the ice - story basically becomes that of a totally different movie - I felt like I had woken up after having slept through 30 minutes of the plot. This movie could have been made much better, had the last 3rd been removed. <BR>As for DVD ownership - it's not worth it. Rent it and see it - the movie is done rather well. But it will leave you scrambling for the fridge way before it's over.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I was shocked to hear these 17 songs because they were so different and at first I didn't know how I felt about it. I loved THANK U, but I didn't think I'd end up liking it but I bought it. She is so unique and I love her style of writing like her brain is pulling the emotions and words at the moment. It's simply amazing. Yes Jagged Little Pill was a huge success but diddn't even touch the surface of the real Alanis who is shown on this one. I love her rock and roll psychedelic sounds on this album and how she uses synthesizers to her definite advantage giving the songs a breathtaking &quot;enviroment&quot;. This is some really deep stuff but I definitely recommend it to any music fan. Buy this album and prepare to be awestruck! (You may have to give it a few spins!)
B00005QZ7U|4.0|With my somewhat... shall we say... conservative... tastes in movies and books, it came as somewhat of a surprise to me the other day that I would even consider sitting down and watching \\"Moulin Rouge\\", that 2001 Baz Luhrmann film about 1899 Paris,  starring Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, and a cast of lesser known but very talented actors, singers, and dancers.<br /><br />What came as even a bigger surprise to me is that I liked it.  I liked it a lot.<br /><br />That's not to say that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" didn't take a bit of getting used to.  Five minutes into the film and I felt my senses being bombarded with frenetic, over-the-top, somewhat hard to follow (and swallow) scenes.  But somehow, through it all, I was able to follow what turns out to be a very simple story line:  two men (one a decent, hard-working, poverty stricken writer, and the other a rich, evil, domineering duke) compete for the affections of the most beautiful woman (a courtesan at the Moulin Rouge, Paris' most decadent and popular show club.)  Poor, good man wins girl's heart; evil rich guy becomes insanely jealous and threatens to close down club if girl doesn't become his; girl is forced to become rich man's lover; Poor, good man becomes despondent... et cetera... et cetera...<br /><br />The story may be familiar to most of us, but the way it's told is certainly the most original I've ever seen.  Every seen is garishly colorful, set at a dizzyingly fast pace, and filled with delightful cartoon-like characters and contrivances.  The acting is above average in most cases, and, in the case of Kidman and McGregor, much more than that.<br /><br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" is filled with wonderfully produced music.  Most of the score is comprised of pop tunes from the 1970s through the 1990s, so there's not much originality there.  But the song selection is nearly perfect for the story.  Each song is specifically designed to enhance a particular scene, and does so with precision and beauty.  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are very good indeed at singing their own songs.<br /><br />THE DVD:  is excellent, and gives viewers plenty of \\"bang for the buck!\\"  This is a two disc package, the first containing the film and a few \\"extras,\\" and the second containing several hours of bonus material.  An audio CD sampler is also included.  Video and audio quality for all features are first rate all the way.<br /><br />MY VERDICT:  Much to my surprise and delight I found \\"Moulin Rouge\\" a wonderful two hours of entertainment.  The story line isn't much, but the acting, the energy, the fast pace, and the wildly colorful sets and costumes, and the music make this a film well worth seeing.Ewan McGregor are very good indeed at singing their own songs.<br /><br />THE DVD:  is excellent, and gives viewers plenty of \\"bang for the buck!\\"  This is a two disc package, the first containing the film and a few \\"extras,\\" and the second containing several hours of bonus material.

B00005QDW1|1.0|I knew it!<br />So I listened to the no doubt record good thing I did not buy it. My friend played it for me in her car to show me how bad it was. Woah boy this is hillarious hahaha!<br />So the music is just awful for me. I am a drummer. Any musician listening to an album will be upset with the guy playing their instrument. Ok so the guitarists play keyboards now. Oh well we needed a new wave in 2001! hahahahaha!<br />So pop fans will eat this up. Mmmm yummy. Me personally I like pop but this is pathetic even by pop standards. Yucky yucky. leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Grrrrrrrrross!<br />Hey baby Hey baby Hey! Girls Say aaaaaaahahaha. Give me a break. Oh my God. Actually this cd did give me a good laugh. Remember when Gwen did a duet with Bradly Nowell of Sublime oh yea man and now its with EVE hahahaha!<br />If you like so called original bands that No DOubt tries to mix try these talented musical bands.<BR>The Urge<BR>Incubus (Preferably older material)<BR>REAL REGGAE (not this mess)<BR>311<br />and if you want keyboard new wave junk go back to the eigthies and get those cd you order of the tv. no doubt tries to mix all these styles and they fail. they write bad songs, write bad lyrics, and have lost their soul, energy, and roots completly. this is a waste of your time and money. :)
6305508550|5.0|This movie is VERY funny! For those of you who work in cubicles, or work for a large corporate office, buy this movie! You'll be laughing your head off! Sip your cola carefully while watching... you are likely to spray it across the room with the next joke :)
B0000029LG|5.0|This album summarizes his career well. On the first disc, there are his greatest hits, which include classics like &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Beat It.&quot;  On the second disc, fans get to hear 15 new tracks, including the duet &quot;Scream&quot; with his sister Janet.  Even though &quot;Earth Song&quot; drags on a bit, I felt that it had some great guitars and a worthwhile message.  Overall, I can't think of any significant weaknesses to the album, except that &quot;Earth Song&quot; dragged on a bit. This is an essential part of any fan's collection.
B00005V0X5|5.0|First off, this album was already a masterpiece besides it's original poor production. Every song is full of interesting riffs and fast thrash. Megadeth have never been just a power chord metal band, they have complex riffs, and they show it on this cd. This remastered version is really different and better sounding than the orignal. All the instruments have their own voice where before they seemed to not stand out. You can hear new notes that you couldn't hear on the original. If you like metal, GET THIS ALBUM!!!! Also the extra liner notes are cool and plentiful. It also includes the lyrics whih the older copy didn't, at least mine didn't. The added demos are cool too as you can see how the songs first started. RIGHT NOW< THIS IS MY FAVORITE ALBUM!!! GET IT!!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|From the moment I heard Maynard start singing in the song \\"the grudge\\" i was hooked. This is one of my favorite cds. It's hard to explain what this cd is like because of the intense hatrid and just pure emotion that is in this cd. Parabola is just awesome. I've never been let down by a tool cd. I gave this cd five stars because lets face it, it blows everything else away. i'd recammend you get this cd if you consider yourself a fan of tool. If you already have it keep rocking out because you know i will.
B00000JZIK|5.0|Wow! Not only does this film have some excellent casual moments of hilarity, some cooly executed violence, some great characters, but it has the finest twist I have EVER seen.<br />The basic story comes from a cripple, Spacey, as he recounts his story to cop Palminteri. It shows how a number of crooks were pulled together by a mysterious crime lord whose very existence is in dispute. The crew do a couple of jobs before getting taken out on a boat during a drugs money intervention.<br />Writer Chris Mcquarie spins the twist perfectly and I don't know of anyone that guessed it.<br />it would have been easy to steer the whole film toward the final revelation, in which case the finale would have, maybe, been expected. Mcquarie manages to wrap the whole film up, conclude with one twist, before pulling the carpet out from under us just as we thought it had finished.<br />this film is a true calssic and among my top ten. Definitely worth buying. I've seen it nearly ten times and the end still makes me smile. Excellent.<br />Shame about Mcquarie's attempt at direction with the dubious way of the gun. Usual suspects is his finest hour.

6302732875|5.0|Mamet is a truely great writer and this film would be little more than an overwrough insight into the extreme pressures forced upon salesmen that make for their desperately, unrelentless sales pitches, if it weren't for the fact that every time someone speaks we are blessed with a genius' voice.<BR>The film shows real estate sales men, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris and Johnathon Pryce being told that unless their sales pick up they're fired. The only problem is that boss Kevin Spacey will only give new, Glengarly Glen Ross leads to sellers.<BR>Jack Lemmon is magnificent as the washed up leader of sales and Pacino is even better as the current leader. Well, to cut a long story short, every one in this movie is great. Each character is given such abrasive dialogue, spiked with humour and malice and self-pittying desperatioin. <BR>My favourite scene is when Harris talks to Johnathon Pryce about steeling the leads. It's the best moment in a great film. Although the characters are profane in their speech, the screenplay is of such quality that it comes of damned close to poetic. I like occasionally to find a film that is completely dialogue driven and this one is probably among, if not the, best.<BR>i would definitely recommend buying as it can be seen over and over before evrything is absorbed.

0451527712|3.0|This was the first time that I actually read Frankenstein only to find out the movies of Frankenstein were all fake.  If you think the book is like the movie forget about it, it's a completely different story.  I did not think that I would enjoy this book the way that I did.<br />The book starts out very boring and I did not really get into it until I was half way. I really liked the way Frankenstein was so human and at the same time such a horrible monster.  The science behind it was a little too unrealistic for me at the beginning but the purpose of Frankenstein himself made that change. Science did not just give him life but also features that are scary to look at, this is the part where if you like horror, you will appreciate Frankenstein's features and appearance.<br />Fiction is definitely a big part of this book and I personally don't like fiction but still enjoyed it.  The book was nothing like I expected from the understanding that I had of what was Frankenstein.  This not only introduced me to the real meanings behind the book and about the time that it was written but also about how much it explains about our societies today in one way or another.<br />I recommend this book for those who think Frankenstein is just another fictional monster because they will have a better if not a completely different story and understanding of Frankenstein and how and why he was introduced in this world.
0812550706|3.0|A friend of mine pushed this book on me telling me I had to read it. He already convinced me once to read When Gravity Fails by Effinger, and I almost didn't finish it because, well, I don't like Sci-Fi.<br />Ender's Game was a decent book, it wasn't monumental or anything, but it kept me entertained for a couple of hours. Card is a decent writer and he puts together a good story.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It's good we all like different things, or the world would be really boring, but can't we at least recognize a great talent when we see it? I'm amazed, it seems people either love or hate Moulin Rouge. I'm glad I'm not an actor, because I don't think I could handle the constant criticism and rejection. I think if you've only seen MR once you need to watch the entire 2 disc DVD, it is wonderful and eye-opening. To one of the reviewers, the movie opens with Ewan McGregor(Christian)typing his and Nicole Kidman's(Satine) story.( the typewriter does not type by itself).It isn't Christian that falls through the floor, it is the unconscious Argentinian, who has Narcolepspy. The movie is frenetic, especially the beginning. Baz is trying to give you a feel for the time and place, which if you knew anything about the real Monmarte and the Moulin Rouge,you would know it was filled with prostitutes,artists,musicians,pantiless can-can dancers, and opium dens.There were also few choices for women unless they were from high-class and, or wealth. We are also spoiled by acsess to the many medicines and available medical treatments of our era. In 1899 there was no treatment for TB, with the exception of morphine for pain, and although the movie is partly fantasy,the symptoms Satine experienced were very realistic. The director only has approx. 2 hrs. to tell a story. You have to watch the entire DVD to see the incredible amt.of work and talent that culminated into a feast for the eyes and ears. It is amazing to see all that was involved in the making of MR, Baz Luhrman is a true visionary!The attention to detail of the sets and costumes was extraordinary! There were many award worthy performances this past year, but none so bold as Ewan's Christian and Nicole'Satine.They both demonstrated a natural talent for comedy and drama.They have beautiful voices and an intense emotional depth that bring me to tears each time I watch it.It is a dazzling mix of comedic and tragic character, brought to life with a tribute to carefully picked, familiar songs, we all know and love, that are a part of the dialogue. Come What May is an original song. Nature Boy was written in the 30's. It dosen't matter when a song was written, but what the words say to us. If you love old Hollywood musicals, you'll love the huge productions in MR.Watch the DVD for the first time or give it another try.It is bold, romantic, tragic, remarkably imaginative, in other words,magical!Many exceptional movies were made last year, with many fine performamces, but MR is the only movie that has it all, great comedy, drama, and beautiful singing and dancing. The entire cast and crew did an incredible 4 yrs. of work! You've never heard Like A Virgin sound so good!
0812567110|5.0|This story is positively a masterpiece.  Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian.  Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way!  If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!  For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"<br />From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray.  The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I couldn't believe it -- 80% of the versions on Morpheus/Kazaa are truly crap.  Somebody just looped a 30 second sample for 4 minutes, then faded it out.  Very lame.<br />On the CD, *NONE* of the songs fade in -- they all have intros.  If you download a version that fades in -- it's a bogus rip.<br />Anyway, I bought the CD, and it's pretty good.  (I had to know!)<BR>Also, the morpheus/kazaa fakes sound like 64/96 kbps -- the CD is much more crisp.<br />So I learned my lesson -- don't trust everything you download from Morpheus/KaZaA!

B00001NFCY|3.0|I think I must have liked this album more when I bought it, but now I see that it just isn't so good.  It ocurred to me recently that I never really listened to this album too much, and that everytime another single was released off it, my appreciation dropped a little more.  But despite how popular or not popular this is, the simple fact of the matter is that it just isn't so good.<br />I need to vent for a moment.  It seems in this day in age that many bands, such as Creed, Nickelback, Lifehouse, etc., are all befalling the same fate.  They're talented bands that get swallowed whole and torn asunder by the mainstream, causing Backstreet Boy fans who couldn't name a single Pearl Jam song to decide they love them, and grunge/metal purists to dismiss them as worthless hacks.  This is not fair, as all these bands are decent musicians who write decent music, and no amount of TRL requests can change that.  But, I digress...<br />My point is that I don't want to come off as another \\"Creed is a worthless, soulless Pearl Jam ripoff who just wants to make money\\" type person because I don't like this album.  I can honestly say that I'm a fan of this band (and the aforementioned bands) for the music, and I got into them way before MTV ever picked them up.  I first heard Creed way back in the summer of '98.  I thought they had a great sound that was not especially original, I must say, but still good.  \\"My Own Prison\\" is a solid and excellent album, good enough to stand up to any of their Seattle precursors.  So, I couldn't wait to get this album when it came out.  However, this is far more mainstream than the debut, and not half as good.  The emotion seems forced, rather than effortless, such as on the debut.  I mean, compare \\"Pity for a Dime\\" to any ballad on here.  It's way more beautiful and meaninful, and Scott's vocals have way more power.  These guys have tons of talent, but I just don't feel that it was well-exhibited here.  The only songs  I care to listen to these days are \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Inside Us All\\", and \\"Wrong Way\\". The rest is just lackluster.  I know \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" was a dedication to Scott's son, but it really just comes off as an obligatory radio hit.  I think \\"Lullaby\\" (from \\"Weathered\\") was a much more successful attempt at what this song was meant to be.<br />I don't mean to make it sound like I hate this album, just because it's so popular.  For one thing, I don't hate it (I did give it 3 stars, after all), and second, even if it wasn't as popular as it is, the fact remains that it's just a very average album.  \\"My Own Prison\\" is a far better album, and \\"Weathered\\" (although more or less the same thing) is much better as well.  I just can't figure out why this was their best selling album.  Buy this only if you are a huge fan of the band, or if you just feel like you have to do everything MTV tells you to.

B000000WA4|5.0|For a while I harbored doubts that this album could've been cut down to a single disc.  Then one day I was bored and I attempted to do said cutting.  These good songs cannot be fit onto one CD!  After trying for a little while I concluded that Billy Corgan made the right call on this one.  The randomness of Mellon Collie, while it at the same time encompasses a whole vision of rock, is it's earmark.  There's just too much variety, especially when you pick out the very best songs, to ever make a single-disc album as cohesive as Siamese Dream. Yes, the tracklisting could've been tweaked (replace Take me down with Lily is one idea); maybe some Aeroplane Flies High songs swapped in, but this CD really is great.  Billy Corgan was on a hot-streak with his songwriting in this period, an inroduction to the equally-enjoyable Aeroplane should convince you of that.  There are so many wonderful B sides to Mellon Collie that it's really unfeasable that it could've been much shortened-think of all the Aeroplane songs wouldn't have surfaced.

B000002UA9|4.0|This is an album you have to listen to with &quot;1963 ears&quot;.  Perhaps it doesn't always mesh with our 21st century musical values, but on that scene this album of 14 up-beat tunes was like a blast of fresh air.  The format of 6 covers and 8 originals would be a template for their next few albums.<br />  &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; is surely the best of the bunch, and still ranks as one of the greatest rock and roll songs ever recorded, while &quot;Please Please Me&quot; rocketed them to the top of the charts in Britain.  But there are other treasures here.  John's passionate singing on &quot;Anna&quot; is wonderful, and who could forget the definite performance of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;?  At a few points they lay the cheese on too thick (especially &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;... yecch) but after all, this was just 1963 and better things lay ahead.  What you have here is infectious, toe-tapping rock and roll.  Please Please Me is a must for any fan of 60s rock and good music in general.
B000000993|5.0|For the most part, most older(not in age) Tool fans began listening to this all important band through this album.  Tool's sound has certainly come a long way from this record but this is definately not a bad thing.  It's interesting to hear some of the seeds that were planted on this album and how they've come to fruitation on the later albums.  <br />In regards to the sound, this is by far the grittiest of their albums.  Most of the bass playing, which like any Tool album is a main part of the song, is thicker in tone.  Paul didn't use as many effect pedals as Justin now does sometimes.  The guitar playing is, well, tighter.  The broad circling strokes and riffs of later albums is wound down on Undertow.  The result are a few shorter and intensely catchy riffs.  This makes the album a far better introduction for new fans than the later ones.  The only complaint I've heard when people discover Tool is that some of the guitar playing is rather piercing at times(Aenima, Lateralus) while it isn't as on this record.  This is an aspect of Tool that you grow into and learn to love but for people having trouble with that, Undertow can usually ease out any problems of that nature.<br />All in all, this is one of rock's most important albums and should not get looked over by anyone.  Get it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you are moved by music, then this movie will move you! It is gorgeous, visually stimulating from every direction, and the acting is superb.  I was completely floored by the amazing voice coming out of Ewan McGregor, and pleasantly surprised by Nicole Kidman singing ability. The chemistry between them is incredible.  The story is stage worthy.  This could be the next CATS on stage! I purchased this dvd, and downloaded the soundtrack.  It's a beautiful picture for the intelligent and romantic at heart.  One of my favorite movies of all time!
B00005Q4CS|3.0|Requiem For A Dream is one of those movies that claims it's twisted, anti-wholesome movie, tactics convert to a work of art. While most movies that fall into this category, do this with ease, Requiem will leave you with such a bleek and depressing outlook, that you will soon forget the redeeming qualities it posseses. This movie follows 4 connected people as they build fantasies in their minds of a happily ever after world, and how drugs destroy these fantasies. By the time these characters realize that these fantasies are exactly that: fantasies, it is too late. Each one has drifted away from the others, and fallen into a whole new world of horror. The movies ends there, and leaves you shocked, tongue out, and grim. This movie plays like a long tunnel that in which these characters see light, but at the end, after pain, suffering, and turmoil, there is nothing but a dead end.<BR> This movie gave me the closest thing to nightmares, that I've had in years, feeling grim and self-possesed to never let what happened to these characters happen to you. In this way, the way that this movie plays with your deepest darkest emotions, it shows signs of a masterpiece, yet I am too numb to see the beauty in it.<BR> If anything, this movie is an excellent way to keep kids away from drugs. One viewing of this movie, is guranteed to be the equivalent of a million anti-drug campaigns. This is not to be shown to anyone under 13-14 though. Teenagers who see this movie must be mature, and learn from the themes presented.<BR> In the end, if I haven't intrigued you enough, see this movie because it is different. I watched this movie alone, after my girlfriend had brought over Legally Bonde a couple hours earlier. As you can imagine the transition is stifling.<BR> Proceed with caution-this is one of those \\"outlook on life distorting\\" movies similar to The Matrix and Fight Club. ENJOY!
B000000H5K|4.0|ROOTS is just a killer album. The riffs are awesome the songs are heavy and powerful. SEPULTURA has matured as a band and on this album, they arent afraid to experiment with new sounds.  ROOTS BLOODY ROOTS, ENDANGERED SPECIES, ATTITUDE, CUT THOAT, SPIT, STRAIGHT HATE are heavy songs that the listener will enjoy and I think really stand out here. RATAMAHATTA is a great song that the band uses third world sounds and Portugeuese lyrics mixed with thier own heavy music that they pull off quite well. The two instrumentals JASCO with only Andreas playing an accoustic guitar and ITSARI which is in the same style as RATAMAHATTA with an indiginous chant are also killer. This was the last album to have MAX CAVALERA as the singer, and with this album he went out with a ban. The only song I didnt care for was LOOKAWAY. I would rate this more as a 4 1/2 stars
B00005JL5S|5.0|Kung Fu Soccer is of the best movies I've seen in a while, don't miss out on a very good movie.  I recommend it to everyone, all ages.  Tons of \\"top notch\\" special effects.
B000000H3Z|5.0|BENEATH THE REMAINS is a metal classic that every fan of metal music should own. It is full of fast riffs, raw power and energy that is missing from todays music. There isnt one single weak spot on the album that I can find. All the tracks are awesome, but I think that the listeners need to really listen to BENEATH THE REAMAINS, SLAVES OF PAIN, LOBOTOMY, MASS HYPNOSIS, and INNER SELF. This is music from a time when SEPULTURA was starting to find their niche and start to become known outside of Brazil. This albums puts them up there with all the other metal heavyweights of the time METALLICA MEGADETH SLAYER ANTHRAX. If you are lucky enough to find the version with these bonus tracks buy it while u can. A HORA E A VEZ DO is an awesome song that rocks. If I could give this album more than 5 stars I would
B00003CXTG|5.0|I watched this movie with every intention of it being as bad as I had heard.  ..., but still I watched.  I am glad I did.  This was a great movie.  This is truly a movie that men and women will like.  Unlike Titanic, which some claim to be a man and woman's movie (it really isn't, its just a romance movie with special effects) Pearl Harbour really does offer something for both sexes.  The love triangle between the three characters is believable and the attack scenes are spectacular.  The only minor quibbles I have is that some parts are a bit melodramatic and despite great acting Ben Affleck, his southern accent sounds a bit off while his co-star Josh Harnett's seems authentic.  But all in all a great movie and a must have for any serious DVD collection.
0815411839|5.0|I became fascinated with the life of Marilyn Monroe like many other Americans of my generation. To finally find a book that deals with her life in a fair and balanced way was an unexpected joy to say the least.  Through this book by Donald Spoto we learn what was really going on in Marilyn's life near the time of her death. But the real surprise was that she was anything but a dumb blonde joke..... very possibly the real front runner of women's rights. She showed women by example what really hard work and dedication to one's beliefs can do for them. If she had hit her stride even 10 yrs. later who knows what she would have accomplished in the entertainment arena. She was on the cutting edge of what was to come.
B000002L9J|5.0|I know this album can mean many different things to many different people, as Smiths albums do. But nothing more encapsulates the affluent suburban gay male teenager sitting in his room alone wondering if there is anyone out there who understands.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|Zoolander is a great movie.But i must say, i expected something else.<BR>But it stills very funny and original.<BR>You have to see this blockbuster.Ben Stiller also directed this film, hes doing great jobs, like \\"Meet the parents\\", \\"Theres something about Mary\\".Listen to me, and go now to see it.<BR>One thing I didnt like was that its a little stupid, but its OK.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Any movie which stirs up as much thought and reflection as seen in these reviews is doing something right.  Too violent for my tastes, but you'll be chewing on the plot long after viewing the movie.  The DVD special features are superb though they will give your DVD player and television a workout.  I've got a \\"smart\\" television and it had a hard time with some of the frame splicing.
B00005RHGK|3.0|I have tried two different copies of this DVD, in 2 different DVD players (Apex & Pioneer) one of which is brand new with all the latest features and this DVD will NOT work in them. The \\"bonus material\\" side works fine. The movie itself will start up fine and display the main menu, let you choose widescreen/pan-and-scan, or languages etc. But once you get to where the movie itself should start playing it will lock up (ie: the counter stops going up and just sits there).  You can go back to the menu and that will work the same as before, but trying again to play the movie has the same results. Tricks like hitting \\"next track\\" over and over again when loading the DVD don't work, putting any of my other DVDs in and then swapping this one doesn't work.<br />Both of my players are Region 1, not Region 0 or \\"region free\\". Since I had the same result with 2 different copies I assume there is a problem with the way the DVD is made or some other kind of overly paranoid region/copy protection.<br />I really want this movie (I like bad movies) so this has been a real disappointment.<br />So beware! If you have an Apex or Pioneer DVD player this may not work for you!
B00000IAU3|5.0|The Guardian (a major UK newspaper) recently published an article branding owners of this album as clich&eacute;d 'trendy' people.. middle class, mid thirties, trying to stay hip, etc. Why? Probably because this was the biggest selling UK album last year. But even though it's clich&eacute;d, it's still a stunning debut.<br />The songs are fully developed and elegantly penned. From the straight-forward &quot;I'm No Angel&quot; and trip-hoppy &quot;Here With Me&quot; to the dizzyingly beautiful &quot;Hunter,&quot; the songs give a 'serious music' impression, but remain easy to get in to. This album is extremely accessible.<br />A lot of people hype up Dido's vocals. Truth is, she's nothing amazing, it's her songwriting and production values that really shine. She has a pleasant voice, but it doesn't stand out from the crowd.. but who cares? The songs do.<br />For the guys out there, Dido is also an extremely good looking young woman, so she covers the eye-candy bases too meaning it's not too embarassing to admit you have her album.<br />Musically, she covers the bases set by Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette and Sade, without sounding much like any of them. In conclusion, this isn't an innovative album, nor is it exciting, but the songs are excellent, the vocals are sound, and the instrumentation is interesting. What more can you ask for?
B000002UJQ|5.0|Kurt Cobain's suicide left the grunge throne suddenly empty throughout the mid-90s, and many grunge warriors were seen scrambling to claim dominance over the angst-ridden 90's MTV kids.  Some were well-qualified, like Pearl Jam or Soundgarden;  some, less than adequate (maybe Silverchair and Everclear).  Throughout this war for grungy superiority was a band off in the distance completely failing to acknowledge some of the ridiculous antics and desparation for attention these &quot;I'm angry and depressed just like Kurt&quot; people were up to.  Radiohead had made itself known by utilizing some of the earlier grunge sound in its first hit &quot;Creep,&quot; but since then had wandered away from the scene to do its own thing.  Then, out of the blue, after nearly 3 years of ceaseless fighting by numerous no-names for the grunge crown, Radiohead puts out &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  I don't even think they knew what had happened, but suddenly, all the grunge fighters stood back and listened.  Now it had become apparent that grunge was a thing of the past, a crumbled country no longer in need of a ruler.  OK Computer not only stands as one of the landmark albums of its decade, but also signifies the turning point in the late 90s that brought it to its eventual close.  By completely disregarding the trend of its time, it had instead paved a new path for music.  Unfortunately, people decided to take directions other than this one and pop culture has instead gotten more and more cotton-candied.  This is a great introduction to Radiohead's intellectual and pseudo-intellectual music; a bombarding of the senses that one doesn't get from the top 40.  It gives you insights, emotions, melodies, ambience, and most of all:  goosebumps.
B00003CXTG|3.0|The special effects in Pearl Harbor are one of it's strong points. True, the movie itself drew less than favorable reviews, but you still should add it to your collection just for the sheer scale of the production. The attack sequences are impressive to say the least.
B00005B36H|5.0|A lot of my friends in high school would rave to me about how Tool kicked ....  Listening to some of their older stuff... Opiate, even Aenima... it just never really clicked with me.  Maybe it's just that they played almost every song in drop D and only used maybe 3 power chords at most, but everything seemed to drone on.  So, for the next 6 years or so, I didn't really care much for Tool.  I also didn't really like the radio either, but one day both the radio and Tool put out something that caught my ear.  Schism (yes, Schism, the one that you heard every hour on the hour over Summer 2001) fascinated me for the longest time.  Eventually I got sick of it after hearing it 20 million times, but the bass riff would always manage to get stuck in my head.  Then later on came Lateralis, with this pounding drumming that kept the beat as ambiguous as possible.  The Tool I was hearing on the radio at work was actually playing with my head.  So, a few weeks ago, I went out and bought the album with skepticism but curiosity.<BR>It's been in one of my CD players ever since.  This album rocks, it pummels you with energy and intensity more than it does with lighting guitar riffs.  There's really only 8 or 9 songs, the others are more like interludes or introductions that set the mood for the upcoming song.  This is an album that you can listen to from beginning to end and derive an emotional climax from the album as a whole.  It's an album that you can pick any track and rock out to it while you're getting ready for work.  It's even an album you can meditate with (especially Disposition/Reflection).  While I feel most of their music just repeats and drones, this can repeat same chord and idea over and over and over (like the first 3 minutes of Triad) and still not get boring.  I don't understand why that is yet, but I'm more than pleased to see that I've found a way to like Tool.
B00005RYL2|5.0|This movie is a real gem. I don't really understand why critics were so hard on it, much less do I understand why a few people here are insulting the movie itself (I know the DVD transfer was bad, so I relate to those people) or why the movie was so cheap, then again, the quality of the transfer of this movie would explain it. But this movie is excellent in all aspects. It's unique, and it unfortunately has had its glory destroyed by lousy sequels and TERRIBLE TV shows.<br />In terms of the acting, contrary to what other people claim here, Christopher Lambert's performance is first rate, and I think it a shame that he has subsequently appeared mostly in bad 1 1/2 star flicks and hasn't since had a real breakthrough in movies. Sean Connery adds real style to the movie with his acting, but it's a shame that he's in there for such a short time. Clancy Brown is as sinister as ever as Kurgan.<br />The visuals and effects are great by any standard and the swordfighting scenes are excellent<br />And WHO could possibly diss the rocking musical score by Queen? With such a strong opening theme (\\"Princes of the Universe\\") a truly emotional ballad (\\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\") and their smash hit single (\\"A Kind of Magic\\") just to name a few, you can't go wrong. If you learned about this movie just by being a Queen fan, and first watched the movie out of interest in their score (my situation), you're in for a real treat.<br />To fans of this movie who were disappointed by the latest transfer, My only suggestion is to wait a while for the Highlander Immortal Edition which will be released April 16, 2002. It promises better sound and picture quality, the uncensored Director's Cut, Commentary, and plenty of Queen material including music videos to their songs from this movie which are musical and visual masterpieces (I've seen them). Plus it's in anamorphic widescreen format, and anamorphic seems like a good way to go especially for a movie like this.<br />In any case, this movieis a winner and magic in it's strongest form. There can be only one.
B00000IONU|2.0|It is not good. It does have a couple good tunes....thats about the only positive thing I can say about it. For all the hype they are getting, I expected to be blown away. It was not to be. Oh well, it will make a good coaster.
B000003S2O|5.0|I SQUIRM WHEN A CUSTOMER ASKS ME TO SUGGEST AN AMBIENT RECORDING AND THEN THEY SEE TIM JANIS, YANNI OR JOHN TESH. ENO'S 'ON LAND' IS ONE OF THE MOST SOOTHING, LONELY, SPARSE, REVERIE INDUCING, ATMOSPHERIC AND HAUNTING SOUNDSCAPES I'VE HEARD. I SUGGEST IT NOW TO ONLY MY BEST FRIENDS...ISN'T THAT ELITIST?
