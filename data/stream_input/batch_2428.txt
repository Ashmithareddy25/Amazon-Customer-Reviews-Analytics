B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I like this game and keep going back to try to get it without using the hint button  Some day I will get it.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I liked the app.  I thought it was great.  One thing though, I tried and tried to get to the full site for so long.  Finally, I seen at the bottom somewhere it said full site.
B004EWEX9Y|4.0|Works as advertised, just plug into your iPad & TV and you can watch movies on the big screen.  I was a little disappointed that it only works with certain features and not all apps (ex. Abc, NBC, etc apps donor work with this).
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the Kindle format, let alone reading Dracula, but I must say I am very pleased with both. I like the journalistic style, including the letters, and so forth, which keeps this verocious reader intrigued. I highly recommend this classic piece of literature! Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game.  It keeps me entertained. It is challenging and fun for any age (50±).<br />I would recommend it to anyone of any age.
B001LF347E|4.0|This first season was well done.  Enjoyed most every show from 1st to last.  Our disks are bad though had two episodes freeze - couldn't finish.  We'll be sending back for exchange.  Bad language and blood is kept to near zero, so not too bad for youngsters.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I received product when was expected and in good condition. This is a must if you want to keep your Voyager Legend Bluetooth in a safe place so it won't get damaged. I like that it gives me extra hours of talk time. I feel you won't be disappointed.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Excellent update on corporate food industry's move toward manipulating our eating habits.  I was shocked and dismayed.  I am recommending this to my organizations, book clubs, and anyone with whom the subject gets discussed.
B00BI745AA|5.0|I was moved by the characters because even though they carried so much anger and bitterness and doubt, they were able to rise above<br />their petty differences and show compassion and mercy...their humanity.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game you can: swipe or tilt to turn, shoot things, use the unibeam, dodge missiles, dodge aircraft, etc.
0307744434|5.0|A book like nothing I've ever read. There was mystery and romance and suspense.......this book had it all! The story was amazing and the writing was excellent. A must read!!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I've never read anything by mr Gaiman before, having only experienced his wonderful brain through visual media, but I am so excited to have discovered this iconic story. Truly a weird and wonderful ride, the opening preface in his own words sums it up nicely. I encourage anyone interested in fantasy or just oddity to dive in.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing and feels like a roller coaster.<br />With a twist of an ending that will make you finish the book fast
0345803485|5.0|One of those books you will not be able to put down!  A new plot and setting for a change, a sexy Cinderella story.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I need to be able to relate to at least one character on some level to find a book worthwhile but this book . . .
B002GEQC32|5.0|I love this album I remember when Micheal first made Dangerous<br />in the early 1990's a special time for me
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Anka has put out a good cd that has many familiar duet partners. I doubt you will be disappointed.Bravo !
B001ZRYQSO|5.0|... you are likely to like him now.  His persona really comes through on this album.  His classics are here, sung with new interpretations at times.  I am impressed with the use of the backup singers. They might be utilized as much as they are because Leonard's voice would likely not hold up through a long concert - but they do add to rather than subtract from the value of the performance.  I am very pleased that I bought it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It does everthing it is supposed to do. Great price. I love that it rotates. Makes reading easier or playing games.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Was excellent !!!<br />Yes will recommend to my friends<br />Because it was a good product and enjoyed it a lot<br />Yes
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I found someone far gutsier than myself. I was drawn into it fully until the last few chapters, when it seemed to just hurry us along to get us through, but at the same time I took it as, it just became &#34;old hat&#34; to her. Very interesting story. I recommend it for anyone looking for a great real-life adventure.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am not even an American and I fell patriotic watching this amazing drama.  This is beautifully casted and acted. A must for any history lover!
B0012E2HRC|5.0|Wonderful acting, beautiful love story.<br />15 more words required, well let's see...I love almost everything Meryl Streep does and Clint Eastwood is just as good . Great actor and producer
6305127646|5.0|A great romantic, action - comedy even guys will love.  The bad guy is classic. Love the music too. It is a bit dated but worth a watch.
B006NF6I16|5.0|By the time this highly publicized album first came out in 1972, David Bowie had          become part of Glam-Rock, a subgenre that showcase flashy costumes and stylish          improvisational rock which swayed with exhilarating hard-driving rock and roll.  The          Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars caused quite a media          stir when it electrified the music world and told the story about a liberating rock star          from Outer Space who lands on Earth as the album became a extravagant success          and a blockbuster hit.   Beginning with the opening arrival Five Years, the track set          blasts off and conclude with Soul Love, Moonage Daydream, the majestic Starman,          Hang On To Yourself, Ziggy Stardust, the electrifying Suffocate City, and Rock And          Roll Suicide, as it chronicles the androgynous alien rock star's rise to notoriety, just          to later fall from grace.  Plus, what you get on the expanded edition alternate takes          on Moonage Daydream and Hang On To Yourself, extra tracks like the Top Ten hit          John, I'm Only Dancing; Velvet Goldmine; Round And Round, and delightful demos          of Lady Stardust (piano solo) and Ziggy Stardust (acoustic guitar).  By successfully          borrowing from Marc Bolan's glam-rock merit and the `future shock' of A Clockwork          Orange (no violence allowed!), Bowie would reach back to the heavy rock heralded          by an off-kilter metallic mix of fatter guitar solos, genuine pop music, string sections          and cinematic-style flourishes.  Officially described as the manifestation of an alien          being attempting to bring a message of love and hope during it's five year stay, but          to be accidentally destroyed by his consumptions and the fans he represented, this          landmark masterwork is backed by Mark Ronson's solid guitar attacks and its boss          saxophone section that helped make The Rise And FallOf Ziggy Stardust And The          Spiders From Mars is such a glitzy keyboard and guitar wielding spectacle that will          always shine as bright as ever for the ages--and beyond.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I installed this on an MP3 and have quick easy access to my mail when I am travelling. This is easier than I thought and I am very pleased with it.
B000TETC6A|4.0|After scoring an instant hit album with The Man Who Sold The World that have          proved to be a compelling and startling success, David Bowie had scored another          equally great hit on a lighter note and upbeat tone in 1971 with this highly praised          album.  Heralded with timeless hits, an uplifting melody, music hall-style virtuosity          and first rate pop-rock artistry, Hunky Dory is a tour de force performed with style,          timeless songwriting, a jolly serendipity vibe and superb musicianship.  Beginning          with the Top Ten hit Changes, the track set conclude nicely with other memorable          songs like Oh You Pretty Things, Eight Line Poem, the alluring Life On Mars?, the          quirky Kooks (whom he dedicated to his son, known to the public as Zowie Bowie,          but legally named `Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones'), his odes to both Andy Warhol          and Bob Dylan, as well as The Belway Brothers.  What is even ironic about Hunky          Dory is that it again define his groundbreaking artistry that retained himself on the          top of the charts when he again impressed listeners and critics with another round          of classic hits (notably with Changes, Life On Mars, Andy Warhol and The Belway          Brothers) that helped emphasized his position on the singles charts. Described as          a sweeping, cinematic mélange of high and low art done with class, Mark Ronson          and keyboardist Rick Wakeman provides the cutting edge solos that helped make          Hunky Dory a definitive touchstone in his career that will remain as challenging as          Ever. Oh yes Virgin may want to check out an out-of-date expanded edition which          came out in 1990 as it features four bonus tracks that needs to be included.
B005LAII80|5.0|Here I thought this was a crappy remake of the original movie not even knowing its a well know comic outside the US. So as this being a reboot, it was an awesome one. I have a 50&#34; Panasonic Plasma with 3D and this movie hands down is the best 3D movie in my collection. The way they used 3D as layers instead of just things pooping out your screen was cool and the super slow mo moments are magical with you see the smoke hovering on top of your screen. Get it and thank me later! Also love that the 2D and 3D disc are the same disc. No need to choose from one or the other.
B000TEMQNG|4.0|By the time David Bowie successfully entered the 1970’s as confident as ever,<br />  he had already established himself as a singer-songwriter known for his folk-rock<br />  stylings, stylish artistry, mystical storytelling, preppie musicianship, and relentless<br />  personality.  Though it did never contain any chart-topping singles, The Man Who<br />  Sold The World, released in 1970, did serve as the beginning of his classic period<br />  where he started working with fellow session guitarist Mark Ronson and producer<br />  Tony Visconti, as he developed a tightly twisted heavy form of guitar rock done to<br />  a radical tone that gnarled upon each listen.  Beginning with the crackling opener<br />  The Width Of A Circle, the poetic action concludes with its rapid pace with All The<br />  Madmen, Black Country Rock, Savior Machine, The Supermen and the title track.<br />  What could be best described as a stark denunciation of tyranny and the far-right,<br />  The Man Who Sold The World is a fascinating view of mankind’s dark side, which<br />  ranks as one of his best and most challenging masterworks as it still rings out just<br />  as clear and relevant as ever, which the fuzzy base razor-thin guitars and Bowie’s<br />  voice meld with his band’s relentless attack. (Oh yes, Virgin Records may want to<br />  check on the unreleased track Lightning Frightening that first appeared on a 1990<br />  CD re-issue, which gave it the finishing touch the first time around).
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Got it for the kids, didn't hear much about this movie and thought it was one of those quicker animated straight to DVD movies but it wasn't. Great story and the animation is good too. We've watched it serval times and its a great movie for any holiday.
B002U1D400|5.0|Now that David Bowie have become a world class rock star in his own right, the          aspiring rock star scored an atmospheric and lyrical blockbuster album in 1969 that          not only showcases his mystical poetic artistry and creative versatility, but it bought          his groundbreaking career a step further.  Space Oddity is a hallucinating, towering          piece de resistance that's highlighted by electrifying songwriting, exhilarating music          background, superb richly-textured excellence, spellbinding acoustic- electric guitar          solos and first rate storytelling, which made it such an astounding blockbuster from          The Psychadelic Era (1966-69). Starting on the haunting Top Ten hit Space Oddity          (the album's title), the pulsating track set then proceed extremely well at the speed          of light with other compelling tracks such as Unwashed And Somewhere, Letter To          Hermione, the soaring Cygnet Committee, Janine, Wild-Eyed Boy From Freecloud,          An Occasional Dream and his swift accordion-heralded Memory Of A Free Festival          (based on an arts festival he organized himself).  Combining its solid mixture of folk          music, ballads and Prog-Rock, what is even ironic about Space Oddity is the way it          some wonderful experimentations which gave this masterpiece it's stunning cutting          edge, as it's demonstrated on Unwashed And Slightly Dazed, a song that reflects a          strong Bob Dylan influence and Wide-Eyed Boy From Freecloud, a Buddhism-style          song featuring a orchestra set up by Mark Ronson, who became his main guitarist.           What you get on the 2-CD edition are beautifully-crafted acoustic guitar versions of          Space Oddity and An Occasional Dream, a brief BBC Radio session, the vitriolic B-         -side classic London, Bye, Ta-Ta and his Italian-language version of the title track.          So if you want to hear Space Oddity in it's own deluxeformat, here is your chance          to hear this complete edition, which make it one an absolute out of this world must,          one that will always maintain it's top within the heavens for countless of ages.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Unless your a narrow minded, dedicated Arthurian and like to pick out the way the series changes or rearranged some of the more established Arthur lore, you will have to realize they did an excellent job of taking a story that has changed so many times over the centuries and putting in to a entertaining format that lasted 5 seasons.  The fact is, no two Camelot or Arthur movies/stories are the same.  Even the &#34;historians&#34; that first tried to write King Arthur in as a real person got many of the facts wrong.<br /><br />The entire series however, and season five in particular kept the spirit of the stories alive and did so in a way that was not painful to watch.<br /><br />The DVD however, do not have a whole lot in terms of any special features or such, and since it is the last season of the show, you would think there would be some more substance put into this part.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The lives of the teens illustrated in the book certainly make you stand up and take notice of how blessed we are.  Very interesting, especially since I am in the medical field.  They really give you and indepth view of their most personal thoughts.  Sometimes, we don't like to think about it,  but there are many more children facing the challenges of life and death. God Bless them.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Well written, kept me guessing. I like the way it all tied up in the end.  Interesting character changes and twists
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|Perfect for some one with large arms and frame like my son. Would say more but do not have words
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I did not see the play or anything, but being a Beatles lover, I needed this album.  I can assure you, you will not be disapointed!  The mixes and transitions are beautifully done.  The more you know the Beatles, and the more you know the lesser known songs, the more you will discover in each song.  You can listen to it over and over and find something new each time.  It is a blast to listen to all the way through and a MUST BUY for any fan.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really like this app. It looks great on my Kindle. I am glad that I purchased it. Great find!

B007HACDLK|4.0|I can only hope that Mitch Rapp is NOT a figment of Vince Flynn's imagination!  But a real person fighting terrorism for the American people.<br />The Last Man is really a story about numerous men whose lives intertwine due to greed,  power,  terrorism, and love of country.  A fast enjoyable read where terrorism is fought by \\"one shot\\" men to keep America safe.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|My bag five, non stop action.<br /><br />One of the best action movies if seen thus far<br />Ever better than hard boiled

1419705849|5.0|My son asked for this book as soon as it came out. So got it for him as a surprise. He loved it. Read it all with in 2 days!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|In Australia parts 1 & 2 were screened on the MTV channel a week ago but I only caught part of it. As the DVD was also released a week ago I bought it yesterday. Disappointed that it came without the third \\"concert\\" disc I have ordered another through Amazon.<br /><br />The Eagles have always been my favourite band and their music along with Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac, America and a number of others through that era did paint the pictures and memories that Glen Frey describes in the documentary. But probably none more so than the Eagles with the harmonies that are such an integral part of their songs they linger longest.<br /><br />Their songbook is filled with so many masterpieces that many don't get mentioned. Notably the \\"Last Resort\\" that in my opinion could be the theme song for all environment campaigns. Written when young men and before the issue became.... let's say trendy.<br /><br />As Don Henley once said they wrote above their age and the lyrics in most of their songs show it even in the lesser played \\"Best of my love\\" \\"Thrill is gone\\" and those others off the Long Run Album \\"The sad cafe\\" and \\"King of Hollywood\\"<br /><br />The harmonies in two of the more mellow Joe Walsh leads \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" , \\"Help Me Through The Night\\" along with  \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", \\"Desperado\\", \\"Lyin Eyes\\" and so many others is the ingredient that lifts their great song writing even higher.<br /><br />If we ask ourselves how many bands can boast as many lead singers and songwriters as the Eagles have and with each able to play more than just one instrument including acoustic how many come close?<br />The most successful incarnation of that other great super group Fleetwood Mac had three and Stevie didn't play.<br /><br />The older visual appearance of the original members Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon comes as quite a shock. Age has not been kind to the once good looking Randy and to see a bulked up shaven headed Bernie you would not recognise either without forewarning.<br /><br />Not to be critical of Timothy B Schmit but to me Randy was the biggest loss of all the former Eagles. It's a pity his \\"Hearts on Fire\\" wasn't in their songbook it would have been a great fit.<br />Poached from Poco before Timothy I'm sure if they had a spot for Paul Cotton they would have grabbed him too.<br /><br />\\"Take it to the Limit\\" was their first number one hit single and relating to Randy we get some other visual with \\"Certain Kind of Fool\\" and some sound snippets in the background of \\"Try to Love Again\\".<br /><br />Don Felder? It appears he now has a lot of regrets.<br />Many people I think feel that Glen Frey particularly was dictatorial but as Joe Walsh confirms it was always about what was good for the Eagles. Glen Frey was/is undeniably the main driving force in the band and conceded himself to singing less in favour of Don Henley.<br />Felder for all his talent as a guitar player was not a great singer and his biggest contribution came in Hotel California. As for the \\"Victim of Love\\" song he felt was his?  To me that was one of their weakest with no flow.<br /><br />Their reunion work and the later solo inclusions by Henley, Frey and Walsh were still first class although now the creative collaboration has almost disappeared.  \\"How Long\\" being dragged out of an old closet is an example the newer material doesn't have the same magic.<br /><br />Listening to the new stuff as you drive down the open highway won't evoke memories like their old songs of the past.<br /><br />At this stage of their careers for the sake of all that appreciated their older stuff perhaps they could do covers of other Eagles like material such as \\"Ventura Highway\\".
B000641D2Y|5.0|Our family loves Home Alone! Our favorite has always been Home Alone 2 and we bought this along with part 1. Kids watch this even when it's not Christmas season :)
B000V86OKG|5.0|My husband and I got sucked into this show and now we can't get enough. We had bought the other seasons at a second hand DVD store but they didn't have the second season. I knew right where I could get it and was so happy with the price and the speed that we got it in the mail. Will buy again soon for sure!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I fell in love with the characters and writing.  The Victorian history lesson in flowers was really well woven into the story
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really did like this book. The plot was good and the writing was great. My only warning to other would be beware of the issues that you may run into with understanding the language and references to places or things that as an American I was just not able to keep up with as easily as I would like. Also, the graphic nature of this book needs to be known to the readers. I would recommend it to friends and family.
142312166X|3.0|So if you've read all the books and can't wait to pick up the next, but maybe you have to wait for the next one from the library you'll probably go ahead and pick this one up.<br /><br />Not part of the series proper, but a supplement to it, it's worth a read for any fan, but don't expect to get into a whole lot more detail than in the books.<br /><br />It includes interviews and some new stories, which were enjoyable reads, with one helping to make the last book make more sense but you can read all five of the Percy Jackson books and not pick this one up.<br /><br />It's a very simple read. No real thought required. It's not horrible, but it's not great either.
0061122416|5.0|What a Journey! An adventure that you will not be able to put down! A small book full of knowledge and wondrous times!
1423101502|5.0|Ok, so it is the last book of the Percy Jackson series, but it's not the last time you'll want to read the book. It's really good and action packed.<br /><br />The battle must join eventually and the campers at Camp Half-Blood are doing their best to infiltrate and destroy Kronos' army as much as possible. But they encounter a problem. A spy in their midst. Who would dare to do this?<br /><br />But Percy, Annabeth and everyone else doesn't have time to worry about who is trying to kill them from within because they have to worry about who's trying to kill them upfront.<br /><br />The battle takes place in good old New York City. Riordan mentions many places that New Yorkers would know, and an outsider would recognize from the TV. He continues to introduce monsters and animals that you've never heard of, and reintroduces some of your old favourites.<br /><br />Percy and the campers have to hold Olympus on their own. How are they, just demi-gods going to do this? The gods are seriously occupied with the monster Typhon, who is waging a path of destruction all over the US! They can't help!<br /><br />He must go with a wildly desperate plan that may or may not kill him. He's betrayed by a friend more than once, and you have no idea who is working for whom in this whole book until you read on. And you will read on because the chapters flow seamlessly into one another once you get started as the book does start off a little choppy at first.<br /><br />Definitely worth the time.
0060527986|5.0|A must read that compliments &#34;The Alchemist&#34;. This Author brings it home in every book and every way! Short excerpts to read daily if you can, although it is hard to put down!

B0087ITBPC|3.0|Even though many mainstream critics didn't care for this film, it actually turns out to be a better than expected light modern comedy. In fact, it's very easy to watch, with a number of attractive and appealing characters. Barbra Streisand, in particular, comes across as natural, sympathetic and likeable.
0385738781|5.0|The Death Cure is a fantastic book about a dystopian society which some could argue is symbolic for our lives now. James Dashner does a great job painting such vivid images in the readers mind. He puts us in the withering city of Denver with Thomas and never lets us leave till the last page. James Dashner also reaches out to the humanity we all have and share. He makes us think about what should be held close when there is nothing left. This is the connection all readers can make, everyone wants to see Thomas overcome WICKED, and James Dashner does an excellent job making us root for the underdog. He addresses many significant issues in this book, which he did an extremely good job at making them key themes in the book. Friendship has been a major theme from the day Thomas entered The Glade in The Maze Runner. The bonds that the kids formed in The Glade helped them survive the scorch and escape the grasp of wicked. (Spoiler Alert) If Thomas and Minho would of had it their way Newt would have turned into a crank right in front of them instead of in the \\"Crank Sanctuary\\". This hit extremely hard with Thomas after he read the note that Newt had given him. He only knew Newt for a short time but the bond that they were able to make was a bond that was unbreakable, even by a deadly disease. I feel that James Dashner was trying to show that friendship should never be taken for granted, it should be cherished. Its one of the only intangible things that we can hold, and keep close to our hearts. Another thing that James Dashner loves to do is leave the reader hanging, and also kill people off in his story. As I was reading this entire trilogy I kept having to fall in love and root for another character, who would inevitably end up dying. Either by grievers, cranks, WICKED, The Flair, and even ceilings. While sometimes I disliked this, overall it was nice because it kept me guessing. This book kept me on the edge of my chair the whole time I was reading which only took about3 days. Whenever I had free time this book was in my hands, and my eyes were glued to the pages. I am not a avid reader but this entire trilogy has made me a fan of this \\"Dystopian Future\\" genre that has been growing in popularity ever since the release of The Hunger Games. James Dashner did a fantastic job at portraying a world destroyed by disease and sun flares. I suggest this book for all readers, young and old. This is a must read trilogy, and will give the reader a new outlook of life, and whats really important.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love it. The kindle fits tightly, which is nice. I feel like it helps protect it, plus I love the look of it.

B004SUWR2C|5.0|If you grew up enjoying UNO then you'll enjoy the time it takes to play the game. It's sort of like Monopoly; it's not over very quickly! But, like I said, stick to it and have some good times. When you get tired of all the copy-cat games, fall back to UNO and have some good memories.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like the Oxford dictionary so much because it's very unique. I would recommend it to everyone who loves to read and every intelligent person. All my friends ask me ,\\" Where do you get all your knowledge from? \\", so I tell them that I got my knowledge from the best dictionary in the world, the Oxford Dictionary of English-language. So, in conclusion, the best dictionary that I have read is the Oxford Dictionary. THE BRAND NEW OXFORD DICTIONARY IS THE BEST OF THE BEST DICTIONARIES I'VE READ. I like it so much!!! Oh, and I forgot to say that the Oxford Dictionary of English-language is my favorite installed app in the world. THANKS WHOEVER WROTE THE OXFORD ACADEMY DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Albeit a completely unbelievable storyline. A little like the TV show LOST but by book 3 you are totally eager to see how it all ends. It was a good ending. Knowing important characters were going to die but as always guessing which ones
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I got this book on my kindle fire because it was only $2, it was a historical novel, and was written by a woman. It starts off great and I was recommending it to other readers. The author has a wonderful sense of humor and I enjoyed the humor very much. This book also has a dark side that put off some other reviewers. I know the dark instances were based on real happenings in Ireland as I have read about or heard about them before. These scenes just made me mad. I have no use for religion as too often, it teaches ideas that are destructive to other humans. Anyway, I became slightly disappointed about halfway or 2/3 of the way through the book. Somehow, it lost its juice for me. The ending seemed a bit predictable and sort of like the author didn't quite know how to end it. I got the impression that the author is new to novel-writing and will improve with age and experience. She has the potential.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I recommend this to any One Direction fan. The songs are just amaZAYN! Wonderful job from them. My best friend keeps borrowing this from me. XD
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Surprisingly funny and smart. I enjoyed this series very much.  Just a great comedy of misunderstandings and good intentions gone wrong.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers this game is so awesome. I play it all day everyday. I recommend that you should get this game.
0307454894|5.0|Wonderful book full of surprises. Not a really happy, feel-good read, but the premise was so new, and the characters well-drawn and interesting, that I couldn't put it down and now finished, am very glad I read it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love that while I am driving down the road I can have the bible read to me!!!  Love that I can look things up in different versions.
B0095P33IW|4.0|If you like the comic book movies this is a good one to watch. Capt America was never one of my favorites but this was done fairly well.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|it gets your blood pumped up.  Easy game for any age.  my husband even joins in.  a lot of my friends play this game
B005CKPQ7A|4.0|This season definitely shows how the main character is changing. He is having an easier time deciding to do bad things, although they are for good reasons. I wish they would go back to the light heartedness that the first season had. Although I know this show is not intended to be a comedy it helped you relate better to the characters when they were fumbling around trying to figure out what to do.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|The plot fooled me, which a good suspense novel should do.  I got interested in the characters, invested with their welfare, expectant of dangers that would be upcoming, and surprised at the finish.  A very pleasant experience.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this for every aspect of my life. Most recently I used it to help study and pass my Internal Medicine Boards.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|They set out to make a sequel and ended up making a remake, and an uninspired one at that. What made \\"The Hangover\\" - a 2009 surprise hit (and a Golden Globe winner) - so refreshing and fun is pretty much gone in \\"The Hangover Part II.\\" The actors give all they got, and the exotic locations are nice to look at, but let's face it. The \\"sequel\\" is a virtual rehash of the original, if not poorly done, still mediocre.<br /><br />So the Wolfpack is back. Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) return, but this time Stu is going to be married in Thailand, not in Las Vegas. And this time, not Doug, but the bride's brother Teddy (Mason Lee, Oscar winning film director Ang Lee's son) is missing.<br /><br />Helmed by Todd Phillips, director of the original, \\"The Hangover Part II\\" tells almost the same story as its predecessor, with some minor differences. We are left with a feeling of \\"we have seen it all already.\\" Or maybe we haven't, as the film's jokes are raunchier and even darker (with Ken Jeong returning as Mr. Chow), as if to cover up the fact that the film is running out of ideas.<br /><br />This is not to say \\"The Hangover Part II\\" is a totally unfunny sequel, or remake, but for anyone who has enjoyed the original, this is simply an unnecessary entry. But they are making \\"The Hangover Part III\\" anyway, which I hope will be at least better than \\"Part II.\\"
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|The movie itself needs no further comment, however the packaging may confuse some. While the Amazon product description (the 70th Anniversary Blu-ray book) currently says nothing about the content of the second disk in this set, it is titled \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\", and it is the same disk as \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\" sold separately. Had I known the \\"Battle Over\\" disk was included in this set I would not have purchased it separately.
B001B7CNXI|5.0|I think this movie was good, but hard to follow. But 5 stars is what I'm rating this because I love the plot, like the actors, and am proud to add this to my collection.
B00985E3UG|5.0|If you ever wanted know what the world of marketing is like, and how marketers distort reality to attain their goals, then this is the book to read.  Mr. Moss has written an extremely well-researched book with a wealth of detail about the ins and outs of the packaged food industry.  The science behind the manipulation of packaged food taste is explained very clearly and in an interesting way, focusing on key executives and scientists who spent their lives searching for the perfect combination of salt, sugar and fat to enhance the taste of otherwise tasteless, textureless products and in doing so, created a health-care crisis in the United States of epic proportions.  The food industry, coupled with our fast-paced life style where almost no-one has time to cook, has produced in two generations, an epidemic of obesity and type II diabetes that threatens to topple our health-care system and our economy.  I highly recommend this book along with Robert Lustig's &#34;Fat Chance&#34; as a companion work.
B0063GORYU|4.0|fun and fast<br />This app is fun and fast to play. It is also easy to learn without rules. It also works great on my Kindle Fire.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Easy and lite to read!!!! Enjoyed her book so much and her TV show.  she is clear and concise.  Thank you
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Leaves us with quite a cliffhanger. Sets up for the next season. Great show! My goodness, it certainly is a great show! Especially for lawyers!
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I really enjoy watching these with the kids.  They have been asking for this for a long time and we finally got it for them.  It is an animated star wars, but it has a great story line  that picks up where the movies left off (between the new and old ones).  It was worth getting the DVD's so that the kids could take them to grandma's or watch them in the car.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I like it. I'm occasionally compelled to write when out and about with my Kindle, and this does the trick nicely.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love that I can stay in touch with Facebook on my devices.  I can't imagine life without social media now.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Too bad this artists was \\"lost\\" for so long.  The words are better than Bob Dylan's songs.....a real poet.  We just missed him in concert in Mesa, Arizona.  I would love to see him live.
034580404X|5.0|It's been quite some time since I needed to keep a glass of ice water next to me while reading. This trilogy kept my interest from the very first page, however, I did tire a bit from Anastasia continuously asking Christian the same questions over and over.  I think he more than proved his love for and dedication to her early on.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I haven't heard a bad piece of music from Buble yet.  This is another collection of songs that should be in your collection.  I wish I had more CD's.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great graphics, worth the money.  Some objects very well hidden!  Definitely should be rated  10/10. Anxious to see the sequel.
B009R659L8|4.0|I always enjoy her books because of the twists and turns that keep me from figuring out who the real villain is until the end of the book.<br />I also enjoy the inevitable romance that plays a secondary role to the mystery.<br />please keep them coming!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|What can I say.  Addicted to StarGate.  My 18 year old daughter giggles and is gaga at His Hotness Col. John Shepherd.  Of course it's predictable in all the usual sci fi ways but our whole family loves it.  Kids have grown up with it.  The Star Trek of their lives.  Wish that it would move into theatrical films.
B00BP4X3W2|3.0|I had so many emotions going on watching this movie. I can't imagine how it really was and the sadness all around and fear for their lives. Very well done.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I absolutely love the game. I found it very easy to learn the basics. But the game is hard to master. I would reccomend this for high school and older. Good graphics. The game explains various things as you play. Very clear on the goal of the game. Good way to pass time. Bad way to spend a night when homework needs to be done.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Very good story and kept my interest. Really would watch many like this that has a wonderful ending. Recomend more to me please.
B0015DWJX2|2.0|This book was recommended by friends.  I found it a little boring at times.  It is an OK  read for entertainment.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|These kinds of movies are my favorite movies to watch. I enjoyed the story line and lokk forward to Season two. Please recomend any that I haven't watched.
0312330537|5.0|Of the couple of thousand books that I have read during my lifetime, few have given me more pleasure than Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts.  Roberts, who was sentenced to a long prison sentence in his native Australia as a young man, escaped and fled to Bombay, India, where he lived a colorful life in exile - running a free medical clinic in a large slum, and later conducting criminal activities for the local mafia.  He was eventually recaptured after a decade on the run and served out the remainder of his sentence.<br /><br />Shantaram, while fiction, is obviously based on the author's life-on-the-run while living in Bombay.  The central character, whose life closely mirrors that of the author, has enough adventures in the nine-hundred-plus pages of the novel to easily fill two or three seasons of a tightly-packed television show or a couple of very good action movies.<br /><br />The novel makes the city of Bombay come alive in a way that no tourist brochure or slick travelogue possibly could.  As a reader, I roamed the alleys and pathways of the slums where I fought fires, cholera, rats, and wild dogs. I walked the meanest streets and the most opulent avenues of the city with a cast of characters real enough to reach out and hold.  I spent time in the bowels of a prison whose stench and  awfulness were almost beyond description.  I strolled the lonely beaches of Goa at sunset and climbed treacherous snow-covered mountain trails in Afghanistan with mujaheddin fighters.  I experienced unrequited love, heroin addiction and withdrawal, crime, violence, pleasure, the death of friends, the promise of birth, and the joy of a dancing bear.<br /><br />The prose of this book is beautiful, delicious even, and every page is bejeweled with phrases and insights on life that beg to be lifted and incorporated into a religion.<br /><br />Shantaram is a wonderful novel, and Gregory David Roberts is a wonder.  I hope that he is well - and writing.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This book provided insight into the means to improve your exposures and your artistic creativity.  I highly recommend this book to beginners and those with intermediate skill level. It is a reference that you will review frequently.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's books...and this one is at the top of her all time best reads...a real page turner from the get go...the ending was thrilling!!!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Clint Eastwood delivers as you would expect.  The story was touching and inspiring.  I was glad I made this purchase.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Just like the pc version you can read pdf's and can with some work fill out forms. Good for reading and get information on data formated for reader.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I must have played Silk Degrees about 2,000+ times in the mid 70's, and saw him perform that whole album live in 1976 when it first came out. Haven't kept up with Boz much in the intervening years, but I saw good reviews for \\"Memphis\\" and wanted to check it out. I love this album. His voice is as wonderful and as distinctly soulful as ever. I put it in my car's CD player weeks ago and haven't taken it out yet!<br /><br />There are many different moods on this CD- upbeat, slow and soulful, blues-y (nice slide guitar). I was looking forward to hearing him do \\"Rainy Night in Georgia\\", but for some reason, the low notes sound a bit out of his range to me. His voice sounds great on all of the other songs, and he's always shown a very good vocal range.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Memphis\\" to anyone who ever liked a Boz Scaggs song. And you can't go wrong with a producer like Steve Jordan!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Use it all the time because is easy and you can have the weather for your area in minutes. Easy to make plans and understand what's going on specially when working inside an office with no windows.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|This movie is great for all ages. The characters are all lovable. Always a movie to put me in a great mood!
0786955570|5.0|This game is great, fairly easy to follow directions, all the pieces are easy to use and work great. If you are looking for a game to try and understand the basics of D&D this is the one for you. The campaigns are set up in an easy to follow format, with cheat sheet cards that make it even easier.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thhis is probably the BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! This game is fun for all ages and all ages will love it!!!!
B008KW43TE|4.0|Great artist! Enjoyed song after song. His style can be appreciated. The song Lost & Pyramid are the ones on repeat for me.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|This show was so good. I don't know why they cancelled it. Great story line. The DVD season pack came quick and with no scratches or loose discs. It was warped in packaging and made a good impression.
0385349831|5.0|Manuscript Found in Accra is the first book I have read by Paulo Coelho not knowing that he has somewhat of a cult-like following. I opened this book without any expectations but soon hated for it to end. Manuscript Found in Accra  is one of those books you want to keep on your nightstand and have a copy in your desk drawer at work.<br /><br />A Greek man known as The Copt is answering questions about life in the same town square where Pilate handed Jesus over to Roman soliders.  There are questions about solitude, anxiety, loyalty, beauty, and many more conditions we face as humans. The Copt answers them all beautifully and direct. Those that are asking the questions are just as diverse as the subjects they are inquiring about. There are a mix of Muslims, Jews, and Christians who are comforted by the words of The Copt. They sit and listen while the enemy is at the gate. Jerusalem is surrounded and by morning will be invaded by the Crusaders. The wisdom of The Copt seems to soothe their souls.<br /><br />This book was inspirational and in a sense spiritual. There were religious references but The Copt was not a member of any religious sect.  The thoughts shared in this book were like a healing salve. Manuscript Found in Accra is one of those books that will stand the test of time. The wisdom in this book will always be useful as long as there are humans on Earth.<br /><br />Disclaimer: A copy of this book was provided by the publisher. The views and opinions shared are my own.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love the characters in this series. If you like historical fiction mixed with romance and and social class struggles<br />That have taken place throughout time.....you'll enjoy this series. Has humor and some serious and sad circumstances.<br />They have beautiful costumes and settings.
0486408434|5.0|Phenomenal book for the basics! It provides the foundation for the student conjurer upon which all other cards tricks stand upon.  Book arrived on time, or better, and was well protected for shipment.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|One of the best movies ever. My Mom went through this when she was young so I bought this for my niece to see it was for her growing up during the dust bowl.
B004QBWU02|4.0|One of our favorites.  We decided to buy it so we could watch it whenever we wanted to instead of waiting for some channel to show it!  :o)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Loads of fun.  Lots of variety and options in the game.  Highly addictive.  The whole family enjoys playing this game.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|A great series, very smart and enthralling but an incomplete ending. Thank god they are making the movie this summer.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|i really like but sometimes it wont refresh or anything so it gets annoying :// but i still love twitter :) follow me? @ziaaaam lol x :D
B003VVAE4W|5.0|Just a great show. Can't wait for the movie. Very addictive and smart and fun. Highly recommend this to anyone who grew up during the 90s and 2000s.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is a lot of fun. Definitely will recommend to all my friends<br />Exciting gameplay especially when the pace picks up.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I couldn't wait to see this season and it was the best so far!  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but diehard SoA fans will love it.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|Happy to see you have the products I need for my Tablet.  I am brand new to this, so I am still learning.
1451695195|4.0|I bought two copies, and gave one as a gift. Its an amazing and surreal experience. I would recommend this book .
B0060MYM7O|5.0|man, i love the quality of the package, the cases, the goodies... everything of this BD, i'm from México and the national edition is not half as good, love the show, love the product!
3836532441|5.0|I knew I would love this book, it is a great price for size and content. It looks great on my coffee table and though I knew it would be a hit with my pin up loving girlfriends even their husbands and my own couldn't put it down. It's a hit for young adults and the old, male or female. If you are looking for a conversation piece that will also be a good read curled up in front of the fire on a rainy day, this is your book.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|An enjoyable game. Not too hard. not too easy. Ends a little too soon. I wouldn't like one more chapter.  I recommend for anybody wanting to spend a few hours having some fun. I don't play a lot of games. but this one is very good in my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have found this game very fun to play and it is addictive to the max and I will<br />Play it more a often
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I don't know why this movie isn't available at every store. It's so convicting. If you haven't seen this movie, please do.<br /><br />Prior to seeing this movie in the theaters I like the song &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; ok. But after seeing this movie the song has a whole new meaning to me and it moves me every time I hear it.<br /><br />(when I went to this movie in the theater I took my 12 year old son because he had gotten into some trouble and I was torturing him by making him spend the day with me. I &#34;thought&#34; this movie would be boring and of no interest to him. On the contrary. He loved it!)
0345803485|5.0|I have read all 3 books in the trilogy and only had copies of books 2 and 3.  I wanted to re-read book 1, so I ordered from Amazon.  Great price and super fast shipping.  I could read this book over and over and never get tired of it.
B0011Z51T8|3.0|There are some interesting ideas, and the album starts out strong. Later in the album, however, White's voice becomes more nasal and the music loses touch with the melodies a bit. Overall, still a pretty good album in a style that is mostly dead today.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|I watch this movie all year long, not just during the holidays.  The cast is superior and surprisingly captivating.  Jack Black is totally out of character in this movie...and pulls it off perfectly.  Best chick flick around!
0743297334|5.0|This novel was enlightening and brilliant. Hemingway does an excellent job depicting the \\"lost generation\\" and the challenges they faced. I found myself intrigued by the tragic love story of Lady Ashley and Jake, and the realistic portrayal of their complicated lives was educational. I would highly reccomend this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love the hidden object point mystery games, but have not enjoyed many of the ones like myst. So when I saw people's reviews mentioning that one about this game I almost didn't buy it. What a mistake that would have been! It was beautiful, intricate, and detailed. Short, but one I plan to play again.
1613821654|4.0|The story of Frankenstein is a horror classic that will always be haunting and yet it seems to have holes in the story. The monster watches the De Lacey family for almost a whole year, he witnesses the changes of winter and spring, but he kills William Frankenstein when spring begins. Also, the multiple amount of narrators, the monster to Victor Frankenstein, Victor to Robert Wlaton, and Robert Walton to his sister and finally the reader, make the chances that all of them could have perfectly recited the letters of the Turk and or Alphonse Frankenstein high unlikely. Also, these large amount of narrators means that they could have been biased in their retellings or descriptions. However, I believe this adds to the whole suspense and intrigue of the book and it is one of the most entertaining literary classics that is full of character development, plot twists, and symbols.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|After all these years I think the original is great to watch again. Very clean picture with improved sound too!
0061122416|4.0|This novel is not only a great story about a young shepherd attempting to fulfill his goals and achieve perfection, but also inspires readers to do the same. The constant struggle that Santiago endures through the desert, with love, and with others trying to hold him back can resonate with anyone who wants to achieve their personal best in life. Paul Coelho immerses the reader in a great story as well as many life lessons to remember.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Like all of the lord of the rings movies it was awesome. I can't wait to see the next 2 films.
B002JJ9XO4|4.0|The novel, Frankenstein, is not the same story that one might have heard when one was younger. Because of this, though, the story was even more exciting to read. Unlike some classical novels, Frankenstein is easy to read with modern language. Mary Shelley develops the story through spoken stories of what happened and letters written back and forth between characters. I would recommend reading this book because people need to know the real story of Frankenstein.
B008220D7S|3.0|ok movie but was not very impressed. I was looking forward to it and was let down by a depressing story.
076790592X|5.0|This novel is excellent. The author captures the interest of the reader through the two main characters' unique relationship. The discussions that Mitch and Morrie have about the meaning of life are extremely interesting and also provide guidelines that everyone should live by. Tuesdays with Morrie is a read that is hard to put down and I highly recommend it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I strongly believe that this is a fake lifeproof case. it does not fit the phone and does not look anything like the other cases i have seen in the retail stores.... soooooo DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE PEOPLE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SCAM!!!!!!!!!!!  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br />^^^^^^
1455523550|4.0|Although I intended for this to be a typical Nicholas Sparks novel, it was far from it. Reading from page to page, I was unable to sit the book down as I kept finding myself wanting to finish. This novel is full of surprises, ones which no one could expect, unless you are in fact a detective, like Kevin. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a little mystery as well as the typical love stories Sparks has become acquainted with.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I have all the books and have read them multiple times the books are great and I can't wate for more!
1563898586|2.0|I had high hopes for this graphic novel, but it just simply does not take off.  The story is slow and lacks action.  The characters are underdeveloped and weak.  They grumble and moan and stutter for no reason.  What the hell?  I am actually thinking the movie is much better than the source material!  Which is rarely true.<br /><br />Quartermain is a skeletal drug addict with absolutely no skills.<br /><br />Miss Murray does NOTHING but wear a scarf and get irritated by the others.<br /><br />Nemo does nothing but stand around and look exotic.  Oh yeah, he has a submarine that does--you guessed it!--nothing.<br /><br />Hyde is the on the verge of interesting.  He is monstrous and tears people apart.  So, I'd say he saves the story from becoming a complete waste of time.<br /><br />The Invisible Man is also interesting.  He is a sneaky rapist with a sarcastic wit.  He has a few cool moments, using his nakedness to sneak about and slice a throat.<br /><br />Oddly, the characters focused on the least are the most compelling: Hyde and Griffin.  They are also the most evil characters, yet they drive the only interesting and/or action-filled parts.<br /><br />Not recommended.  Do NOT waste money on this.  Try to borrow it from a friend or get it at a library.  This is MUCH too expensive for such a lackluster read.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Too short no real help available if you get stuck. Puzzles were ok, but storyline was limited to small area and somewhat boring.
B00004X07N|1.0|Ordered for my daughter for her birthday because we love old movies!  First of all, wasn't sealed! Then we tried to play the movie, but would not play!  Tried several times!  Not sure what to do now!  Other one I ordered was great!
B003AKLFAG|3.0|The acting, camera work, color choices, and all the rest of the building blocks of the story were great, but the story itself was pretty lame.<br /><br />I like a film where even if you don't actually figure out what the plot is, you can see how all the pieces naturally fit together when things are finally revealed. Things are implied or make you think you should have figured it out on your own. Every twist in this film had to be completely spelled out to the audience because there is no way you could piece it together because they were simply ridiculous. No foreshadowing. No aha moments. Not even a decent moral. Just a great presentation of shallow content.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Family dynamics were  interesting but too much time spent on trial and legal aspects.<br />I found parents reactions not entirely believable.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|I think the album is great but the download from Amazon delivered a poor quality sound and I can seem to find where to let Amazon know to see if there is anything I can do about it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really love this show and can't wait for another season to start.  There is just something so nice about a show that doesn't center around sex and violence.  It's just a really good clean and entertaining show.
0312944926|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. Best price for a new book. Fast shipping. He really liked the book. No complaints. Can not say more because I did not read it.
B004HYDL1K|1.0|Okay. I didn't really expect too much and only watched it because it was my husbands pick.  But come on.  This was some of the corniest acting I've seen.  Very cheesy and very very graphic.  Wouldn't recommend to my enemy.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love how quick and easy it is to order a book from amazon and have it delivered to my kindle.  However, I feel if you watch her TV, you've basically read the book. Not a big fan
0452295548|5.0|My Stroke of Insight gives hope to all those who have a loved one who experienced a stroke and couldn't communicate. Now we understand what they felt and realize that they are at peace, even nirvana. Thank you Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game it's awesome so much fun nd it's super addicting. Collects coins right away nd can buy lots of upgrades it's super awesome
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Page turner!  Great book. The only thing I was left wanting was (spoiler) all answers!  As a parent, it made me think how I would react if I was one of Jacob's parents.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|But worth it once you get the hang of it. They should make it less stars to get to the next world.
B00BAVCD8A|3.0|I must say I expected more from Fall Out Boy regarding this album but it's not terrible.<br /><br />To keep it short and simple: Average [Sample it before you buy]<br /><br />(Personal Opinion) The cover is...bad and doesn't fit the album at all
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fantastic game. Its even so easy for my five year old. Even I really enjoy this wonderful game in my free time.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Well written without bias and overly theatrics, well researched, I thought maybe the beginning was a bit slow but overall I liked the book.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Seems like an  excellent story. Still have half the book to read. Would recommend it to anyone for their reading pleasure.
B000VK6MNI|1.0|i was sent a movie that does not play in my xbox 360 or any of my dvd players, thanks.      EDIT 10-17-14 doesn't play on ps4 either.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|Amazing a wonderful story of the alex rider series. Trully lovely story of the alex rider series. Cool rock awesomeness.
0812982622|5.0|I was apprehensive about this book because of how little we know about North Korea, but the fact that I couldn't always tell what was fiction and fact just heightened the tension of the book for me.<br />I found the book lyrical and beautiful. I was really impressed by how he was able to pick up threads from earlier in the novel without them seeming forced. I stayed up all night reading it and read it in less than 48 hours. (I don't recommend that because I was very depressed after!)
B001DM1VXE|1.0|If I could give it no stars, I would. I don't want to spend much time attempting to enumerate all the things I disliked about it; it's taken enough of my time as it is. I would have turned it off after the first couple of frames if I hadn't been watching it with someone who wanted to slog all the way through it (but who also ended up hating it). I can't remember when a movie has bored me so much or seemed so ridiculous. It's artistically pretentious but, at least in my opinion, disastrous. The plot wouldn't have stood up even in a movie that was much better made. If I'd paid a penny for it I would have asked for my money back.
0955153077|4.0|Now im not very far into the book, but I must  say its quite thoughful. It is wrtitten by somone that is actually a digital artist and that alone makes the book worthwile. I would highly recomened the book if you have the money for it.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|THE GUILT TRIP is essentially a movie you might find on the Hallmark Channel or Lifetime minus the F-bomb scene.  The script is basic doting mother/nerdy son dilemma with occasional laughs and manipulative tears.  The one thing that elevates the film is the performances of Barbra Streisand (her first starring role in 16 years) and Seth Rogen.  The stars generate a marvelous chemistry.  Rogen plays Andy with a contained emotion just waiting to erupt.  Streisand gives perhaps her most honest and restrained performance ever.  Gone are the long fingernails and the glamour found in other roles.  This is not a diva performance---she shares rather than dominates the film.  I have always admired Barbra---a talented and incomparable performer.  Whether you like or dislike her personally, one cannot diminish the magnitude of her abilities.  She makes THE GUILT TRIP worth taking.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was to me probably one of his most emotional yet drastic books next to the notebook I loved it!!!
B00C1BTWV4|2.0|Unfortunately, I am beyond 12 years old. Michael Crichton's imaginative and fascinating novel brought to vivid life by Steven Spielberg.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great read, I could hardly put it down. I can picture every scene in my head. I can't wait for the movie:)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The graphics are very nice. The game is addictive. I like building the reef but wish I could build faster. I will not pay for items to play faster.
B005NK69ZC|4.0|This wasn't quite what I expected form this book but hey I love Ellen And enjoyed laughing along the way.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Narrative style was great, a series of vignettes recounting specific experiences during a zombie pandemic. Not sure how it will be translated to the screen (poorly by early reports), so judge the source material independently.<br /><br />Probably not a great read if you don't love the genre at all, but a must read if you do.
145162607X|5.0|I'm looking for two things when I read historical fiction: a reasonably close adherence to real history, and a presentation of historical characters who come to life through the author's ability to make them fully rendered personalities. Philippa Gregory does that and more in her novel, The Kingmaker's Daughter. The War of the Roses period in English history is rife with excitement, and Gregory has written other novels focused on specific characters of the period. In the current book, the focus is primarily on Anne Neville, daughter of Richard, Earl of Warwick, and her sister, Isabel. Richard chooses mates for his daughters hoping that one or the other Neville girl will become Queen of England. Gregory's 400+ pages of politics, battles, setbacks and advances will entertain any reader who enjoys finely written historical fiction. Most of all, readers will feel that we know many of these characters as individuals and care deeply about what happens to them.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|This had lots of promise and a great cast, but the editing/directing felt really ham-fisted. Scenes were overly short and cuts were choppy, lots of &#34;tell me&#34; instead of &#34;show me&#34;, and real hollow motivations for the characters. Total let down and a waste of the time spent watching it.
1439165645|5.0|This book is a sort of food porn - it describes the smells, tastes, and preparation of Indian and French cooking so well that I just want to go to Michelin starred French restaurant (I've never been anywhere even close in my entire life) and likewise to a loud, gaudy Indian place like *Bollywood Nights.\\"<br /><br />Hassan Haji is to cooking what Howard Roark was to architecture, well maybe that isn't the best analogy - let's just say he's the Lance Armstrong of cooking, genuinely gifted - well wait a minute. At any rate he is a naturally gifted and superior chef and the hundred foot journey of the title describes his walking across the road from his dad's raucous Indian place to train at a haughty French inn ran by the supercilious Mme. Mallory.<br /><br />The story and the characters are good but face it - this book is great because of the food. Highly recommended.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and was really pleased with this DVD and what it portrayed.  Everything was in excellent condition and I'm happy!
0061339202|5.0|Great book on the psychology of happiness. Very readable.Fascinating research and background material. A must read if you want to understand the joy of life
0060920084|4.0|This was the first of Bryson's books that I read and having lived in Iowa, I can appreciate where he came from.  This book had a certain romance to it.  It's a road book, and he did his best to describe the small communities through which he passed.  It's not the best book he's written, but it's certainly better than some of his later offerings.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun to play I play it every day and night to win lots of new this and I rate this a 4.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I can't imagine a world without this app! Thanks to Adobe all my files are at my fingertips! Thank you!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is very well written. You really feel like you know the characters. I highly recommend it for a good read.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the movie, but in particular, this was a great buy, as you also get the Ulraviolet download as well. I can watch the DVD on the TV, the ultraviolet on my tablet, computer, or phone if I wanted to watch such an epic film on such a small screen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  Play it everyday! My kids play it too!  I really like the challenges and finding the power ups and extras. Makes the game interesting.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is one of the best Match 3 genre of games, as long as you don't mind being timed for every screen. You actually have one minute to score as many points as possible and there are three or more point amounts per treasure chest to open it. The farther you get into the game, the harder it is, but you can buy idols that can help you immensely in your game play. I usually don't like being timed while playing a game, but it fits this one perfectly. It actually took me nearly an hour and a half to open just one treasure chest! Was I mad? No, I wasn't, because it was a challenge. And who doesn't love a challenge. You really get a feeling of accomplishment when you do achieve your goal. Love the graphics and the gameplay, especially the minigames (which are not timed) that pop-up sporadically to give you more money (stars) to buy more idols. These mini-games are just as challenging (if not moreso) than the game proper. Bravo to everyone involved in creating this game!
B0063IH60K|3.0|If one finds solitaire challenging, then this is the game for you !  I don't play it often due to the many other games that are now available on the web.  Many of those are more addictive and challenging.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I remember when I first read this book, back over 30 years ago. A friend loaned me the book, so I wanted to like it. But I found the &#34;rhythm&#34; of the writing hard to bear. To me there seemed to be such a predictable beat to the first chapter that I barely made it through. Then Faber interacted with his landlady, and I was hooked!<br /><br />This is a gem of a spy novel, based on actual events (and the further these events recede into history, the more this should be appreciated), and pitch-perfect in character development. The reader becomes engrossed in Faber's story, then is introduced to Lucy's. It won't be a surprise to many that these two are going to run across each other, but the tale of how they get there, and what transpires along the way, set against the backdrop of WWII England, is simply engrossing. I couldn't even guess how many times I've re-read this, but each time I do, Follett just drags me right in. This is a book I will NEVER be without (so glad I scooped it up for my Kindle!).
B003XD7ECI|5.0|I first heard both Michael Kiske and Amanda Sommerville as guest artists for the group Avantasia. I liked them so much I searched for other albums for both and found this gem. Amazing vocals set to hard rock music, no way to go wrong there! Love the entire album. My favorite songs are 'Don't Walk Away', 'Arise' and 'If I Had a Wish.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I had not read this for many many years.  I was wonderful to come back to an old classic!  Makes you think,
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Been a fan of Depeche Mode since they hit the scene in the early 80's. And 30 years later, they still have it! My favorite tracks are 'Angel', 'Heaven', 'Broken' and 'Soft Touch/Raw Nerve'.
6303187064|5.0|I don't know why I am reviewing this now? I bought this movie before DVDs were out...all I can say is great movie.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This is a quality film with some great actors in it.  Thoroughly enjoyed this and a great watch. Top Notch
B004SIIBGU|5.0|There plenty of things I can think of that could be done to make this app better, but it's just an app. I'd use the full site for serious shopping though.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I liked this even better an &#34;19&#34;.  I will definitely purchase more CD by her in the future for my listening pleasure.  Some songs definitely bring back wonderful and sometimes painful memories.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I have iTunes....need I say more? It's ok if your tablet or phone is android base. The player is ok
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I had heard Adele many times in the past but had never thought about purchasing a CD until I saw the latest James Bond movie where she sings the title son.  Wish I had been on this CD but will have to purchase another one in the future.
6303109950|5.0|I don't know why I am reviewing this now? I bought this movie before DVDs were out...all I can say is great movie.
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|This is a wonderful story (as the producers framed it as a circle) of life on earth. Breathtaking and in the same type inviting toward pondering on the human condition and our impact on the world. The end leaves one contradicted, as both beauty and creation as well as pain and suffering are mixed throughout the footage. No words are spoken, but so much is being said.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play it on the flight, hotel room, job site, while taking a shower, wash the dog, on romantic dates, while teaching my class, eating, sleeping and having surgery
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Amazing book, this should be a must read for all. I read it when already a father... My vision on life is changed.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this app all the time, it's perfect for the on the go business type that looks at PDF files.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large buttons make it easy to use.  I did not get to use it a lot, but it is fun when I use it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I really like this app! I love how you can wake up gently to your favorite songs or snooze for another five minutes....definately like that you can chan
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I would have gone 5 stars, except that immediately following he initial download from the store there was an additional download of 579mb that meant I had to sit at a static screen and wait. additionally once in game,if you start an upgrade there is no graceful way to exit to wait for the upgrade to finish while doing somehing else. Beside that, great work guys!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Pretty neat little puzzle app. The only issue is getting it to load properly on my Kindle Fire, get a black screen a lot and have to reload.
0140120416|4.0|Good learning tool for someone with absolutely no knowledge of this language. I've completed 2 lessons, and can already read and remember some words and all the characters in the alphabet. I give it 4 stars out of 5, because I'm not finished with it yet, so I have no way of knowing how effective the course will really be. Maybe at a later date I can come back and re-review it.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Wife likes Denzel Washington and he is an excellent actor. The language is a little over the edge and really related to the story line itself.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|A good alternative when on the run, but there are many limitations. For basic functions, however, it does the job well.
B001QJUX24|5.0|One of the best from the Duke and Director Ford. Best scene is with Ward Bond drinking that cup of coffee.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I did not like the 'cliff hanger' structure at first but now can't wait to see the ending/beginning and am very curious how they would turn this into a movie.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|It asn't fast as in quickly, it's fasting (500 calories, for women, 600 for mrn)  two days a week. Fasting becomes quite easy the longer you do it.  The book describes how Mosley arrived at the fast idea and offers scientific evidence to back up his claims.  He includes ten days of fast-day menus as well.  On the five non-fast days each week there are no restriction, but I found that I didn't eat as much as I had before I started.  One chooses the days in the week that one fasts, leaving at least a day between fast days.  This is  very effective,  In a month, I have lost 6 pounds and a friend has lost 8. This is the only diet I've been able to stick with over the long haul.  I highly recommend this book.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Rock of Ages is an excellent movie! Tom Cruise is really awesome, he really rocks! the soundtrack is really great and Is sung by the cast members. I found myself singing along with the songs. I did not know that Tom Cruise could Sing! He also looks really hot in this movie!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I have always loved terminator since I was small, I especially loved this one, I would recommend this to anyone.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I'm giving it three stars, although a very good written memoir. There were parts in the book were the type was running over each letter. I had to keep shutting the book down and reopening it. I don't know if it typos or an error with the kindle fire. I do have problems with kindle fire with games but never with a book. It was justified st very frustrating to try and read. The ending could have let the reader know what happened to his family. Otherwise  a good read.
0321127420|5.0|Cover is hard and protective, pages are floppy and easily turned, doesn't require too much muscle power to get to the next page.  Could use more pictures of kittens.  All in all, it does everything I expect a book to do.
0307454568|5.0|Love the series.  Hard time tring to find something else to read.<br />I would recomend this book to others.  Enjoyed
B002FRNCG0|4.0|Great CD. Like the songs. Have no problem putting the CD in and just letting it replay over and over. Great work Paramore!
B00CEF014E|5.0|Read this entire book in about two hours -- was a bit skeptical of the murder-mystery genre element but the pagan element and incredibly compelling main character completely drew me in. This story is the definition of a page-turner; you never know what's going to happen next as you become progressively more deeply involved in the bizarre world of the rainbow cult.
B0009W5K0Y|4.0|I really enjoy Paramore. Always have. I knew a couple songs off of here from the radio and movies, but never bought the CD until now. I'm glad I did. It was good.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|A must for the Avatar Fan.  Contains all 3 versions of the movies plus deleted scenes and a making of documentary.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I had bought tickets to see Paramore and thought I should brush up on their albums including pre-ordering their newest one. I finally popped the CD in my car and I am so glad I did. I was instantly in love with every song that played. By the end of the album, I thought wow. There wasn't one song I didn't really like. I love their album riot which is what made me fall in love with this band and this CD really reminds me of how amazing Paramore really is! Must have for Paramore fans.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|If you have a Monster High fan in your home, this movie double feature is for them.  Quality of DVD is adequate.  Good price.
140591243X|5.0|The sequel to Gabriel's Inferno...not a Christian Grey kind of book but the intensity is there throughout the book.  Definately a great read!
0385349947|4.0|I wish I could say I loved this book as I started off really enjoying it and feeling its power. Unfortunately, half way through it unraveled or lost the momentum for me.  The first half is full of a mix of stories and lessons - which I enjoyed and resonated with.  The second half lacks the stories that I thought were powerful and tends to focus too much on women and kids.  I would borrow a friends copy...you can read through it quickly (only 172 pages) or flip through the parts that are interesting to you.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a fun, quirky movie that will keep you entertained.  It's a funny, tongue-in-cheek spy thriller with wonderful performances by the cast.
B007FXLWKW|1.0|There's a scene in the movie where the rabbit shows up at the playboy mansion and asks if he can stay there. He then mentions something about \\"sexy playboy bunnies\\". I found this inappropriate for a movie targeted at kids. My kids wanted us to explain what it meant. I would return it but returning digital content is not allowed.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really liked this book, until the end. There didn't feel like a conclusion. I hope there is a second book.
B00A757EFW|2.0|this game was a good idea, but it is really hard to controlled and no fun. the things that chase you (the ghousts) go super fast and you go super slow. You pretty much just die right at the begaining. blah, irritating definatly not my favorite game
1463707606|4.0|This book contains beautiful projects that are really challenging! The directions were not very clear. The designers really need to try these out on regular people so they can know what we are looking for.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Hey -it got this fat girl running!<br />Don't read this if you don't want to be inspired, motivated or just don't like a good story.
B00280LYHS|5.0|as exspected, Rick Riordan completed the series on a great note! good over evil, but he did leave it open for the what if's!!!!
B00B5AIB14|1.0|We know the music is terrific but calling this shoddily packaged edition \\"deluxe\\" is surely a stretch and a misnomer. As mentioned before, the early 2000s Marley releases were indeed deluxe. For this edition it doesn't look like they took the time to check and proofread the final product before having it manufactured... they can't even make up their minds if the song listing on the back should be written in lower or uppercase... when people whine about the music industry it's usually because of products like this, i.e. no care or thought taken in ensuring the product/packaging is up to the standard of the music contained within.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is really fun.  I love drawing and making people guess. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to draw or to play quessing games.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I love this CD, is...Intimate & deep, the social essence, what we think, we should be and discard, consider this cd a conversation with our self-esteem, spiritual ... far beyond what it means that shallowness &#34;In GOD WE TRUST&#34;(Slogan), better Christian, a better human being, is a reflection as a society, union, hope...especially in a relativistic world .. does not work. The song Amen ... ***** the true face of marital intimacy fullest to be really happy,-Not Running Anymore song ... amazing personal story, our internal leon that does not lead anywhere and returning to what really It must have been, the prodigal son returns to his home...Each song as Because We can, I`m with you, That`s what the water made me & the others...wow, This CD is a mystery to decipher ... a metaphor very interesting, I consider this CD a confession of who we are, we think, we want but we can not be alone, what is your sin, that limp ... and let you know that not alone but depends on you. I recomended it 5 Stars, one of the best works by John & Richie. vision of life, their experiences and even yours...
B005ES0YKO|4.0|It is great.<br />I bought Crocs before,and it fits me well,<br />I will wear it all the summer and autumm

B009AMANBA|5.0|I have 5 children ages 18 to 4 and every one of them loved this movie! No one was board! They have asked several times to re-watch the movie.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|The rat tail file for sharpening serrated blades is awesome but the carbide and ceramic sharpener sucks I guess it's worth the cash.
B007JMW46U|3.0|An avid lover of Sherlock Holmes in most media, but had not read all of the novels, and a few of the short stories, thank you Amazon.
0440237688|4.0|I had not read The Giver before starting it with my 9 y.o. son.  It quickly became clear to me that this book was going to bring up lots of topics for discussion.  As a parent, you should decide if your child is ready for some of those topics, including conformity, free will, behavior modification and infanticide.  If they are ready, you will thoroughly enjoy what this exceptional story has to offer.  I only gave pause in one short section when Jonas describes a dream he had involving his friend Fiona (\\"Stirrings\\"), primarily because I wasn't prepared for it.  After that, I actually finished the book in one sitting after my son had gone to bed, just to make sure the rest was appropriate for him.  We then finished the book together.  What I found most profound about this book is that the society described and those governing it are not blatantly evil. There is a subtlety to what is happening that makes it both scary and very realistic.  Another person who commented said the inhabitants are happy and satisfied with their society - I disagree. The inhabitants act that way because they are drugged.  It's true they willingly take those drugs, at least most do. But they really don't have the capacity to be happy or satisfied, do they?  Old people in this society are treated with great respect and care, but they are also then \\"released\\" instead of being permitted to die of natural causes. Good? Evil? The discussion can easily go both ways. That's true for almost every topic that the author addresses.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading the other 3 books of the quartet, and yes, I plan to read them before reading them together with my son this time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like it i go on it  every day to complete daily chalenges and it it is fun to go on
B008QE9XD2|4.0|The re-imagined Tim Burton film version of the classic daytime gothic soap opera is stylish, dark with some laughs thrown in.  This is not like the soap opera nor the 1971 film based on the soap opera.  This version works because Johnny Depp brings his own dark and comical style to the role.  The result is a very entertaining film that establishes its own style.  The fact that it is set in the 1970s also adds to the camp and fun.  The film is well-shot, acted with gusto and features some new twists.  This could turn into a series but lets see what happens.  Overall, this is a hip horror film from Tim Burton.  While not his best, it deserves the moniker - Burtonesque.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|wow this game is fun and addicting cant put it down until you upgrade your weapons then depending on what it is it can take forever
B00008J2PG|4.0|Know story, this DVD will not play, It seems to be blank. How do I get another? Without having to pay for it.? Do I send this one back?
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I would recommend this to any family who needs a great laugh. If any of you have played games from the 80's to today you will find references to classic titles to hits that the kids now play. The strong story of being proud of who you are also rings true. Watch it today.
B003MC5N28|2.0|I like this book but i did not like the ending it was confusing to me it didn't really fit the story but through out the book it's very good!
0788859544|5.0|The Little Mermaid is the most beautiful movie I've seen in my life. The music is memberable, the colors is beautiful and every minutes you watch it, it beyond breathtaking. 9.5/10
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The teens and the complications and pain in their lives felt real.  They became people I care about and think about even a month after finishing the book.  There were a few improbable plot twists that felt manufactured to move the story along, but at its heart this is a story of people who let me share a bit of their pain.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I've always been a fan, this disc is great! Only thing, I would've loved to hear more of Chuck Billys deathmeath vocals.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun,appropriate for all ages. Can play for hours.very addictive<br />compete with friends for the highest score. I love this game
B008YZXYY2|4.0|Part one is not as heavy as part two' all in all both discs are great, if you like concept records.
0316067601|4.0|if you like action adventure, this is the one. A real american hero. What he went through was amazing. smile
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This is not really a book so much as an invitation to a transformed experience and way of life. Don't read it; become it. Don't just think about its simple premises for change; change. Not someday. Now.
B007TML4EI|3.0|Game is fun but the higher levels are rediculously hard.  If you have a LOT of time to waste it's OK but it gets so hard it's not fun.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Must read all three books.  Ready to read again.  Wish there were more books to read.  Highly recommend.
B0001HAISG|5.0|My 4 year old loves this adaptation of Peter Pan.  So glad we bought it.  She watches it so much that is has gotten scratched and we may buy it again, that's how much she likes it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  Have to read all three books.  Ready to read again.  Too bad there were only three books in series.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|The story began well, but the plot did not seem to develop to any great extent and began to be somewhat repetitive as one read on.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A great movie from Hollywood.  Not overly predictable and not like 8 other movies you just saw.  Great acting and story.  I will rent it again.
B001BKVWYG|3.0|A couple of the songs are very good and the rest are just okay or not good at all. Disappointing overall
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|GREAT GAME. I did have one time when the screen did not respond on my KFHD, but a quick restart of th game was all I needed to do. I still gave the game 5 stars because it is so clever and the 3D graphics are super.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|This album is almost as good as Amigos, an older album by Anka. The Sinatra song is good, but, I believe the same song duet with<br />Julio I. is a little bit better. TOM
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game. I really enjoy playing it.But some improvements to this game will be more quality in the Tokyo edition of this game. It seems really under my standards. Also I think there should be different music for each city the game takes place in. This is only a suggestion. I am an game creator myself. I create games with my Barbie dolls. Hahaha lol I am only an eleven year old.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Love the app I have had this for sometime on my Mac and i pad and was glad I could now down load it to my kindle fire.
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|Prepare to wait if you would like to watch anything off amazon prime. I tried it off my iPad and it was a no go....
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love this series.  The television show has been wonderful but the books have been even better.  The characters are very interesting and keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what is going to unfold next.
B005T87QCI|5.0|so so so so awsome best game on my tablet.  you should really get this awsome game if you like the movie.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|This was a great book!  Scott Kelby has a great sense of humor in talking about today's digital photography.  He takes the technical jargon out of it and breaks it down in a easy way to understand way.
1400032717|4.0|Very different from many books I've read, and while I wasn't entirely riveted with the story, I was swept away by the narration, which I suspect was the author's goal. To read how an autistic teenager navigates the world, especially when that world becomes painful and darkened by betrayal from loved ones, was enlightening and heart-breaking at the same time. Though Christopher cannot empathize with those around him, readers will most certainly empathize with him. But we also empathize with his father, a man who's made mistakes but has done the best he can in very difficult circumstances. I recommend this book for a different literary experience.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|This is a very attractive case for my Kindle. Positives are that it is made from a material that's not liable to slip out of your hands, it has a nice sturdy zipper, and it's pretty well-padded to keep the Kindle safe if dropped.  Negatives are that it could be padded a little more so I would feel even safe if I dropped it, that there could be a little more room inside so that I don't have to stuff it in in order to zip it up, and there is no pocket of any type inside or outside to carry cords, a stylus, or whatever.  I would suggest that these changes to be made and then I would up it to 5 stars.  But at the present, it is a nice case and I'm using it daily.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great book that documents history from the men who lived it. The book reveals that a lot of good men from both sides have their lives for their country.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I love horror movies, but always hate the Scooby Doo endings. This one has a Scooby ending, BUT I stil give it 4 stars for effective creepy scenes. It's hard to creep me out, but this movie did. Especially the first half. I also normally can't stand one-note Ethan Hawke, but he was good in this one. Give it a try. True horror fans will say &#34;it sucks!&#34; &#34;It's not scary at all!&#34; blah, blah, blah. If you're that person, go watch the news and be scared. If you're looking for fun, creepy entertainment, then turn off all the lights and watch it by yourself at midnight like I did.
0143038419|4.0|This was a beautiful movie to watch. I love to travel so thought I'd try the book for more insight. Elizabeth Gilbert seems to be somewhat self absorbed and a tad bit whiney. If she compared her life to about 90% of the rest of the world, she wouldn't feel the need to find this inner peace and balance she thinks she was missing in her life. She would just be thankful for everything she has. That being said, it has made me put a little thought into the condition of my own life. I enjoyed the travelogue-like descriptions of the places she visited and learned a little too. She's a good writer. It's easy to read and funny in parts.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Great job producing this dvd. Works great, fun to watch. Great american film making. Love to watch these old movies from my childhood.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I enjoyed the movie so much and loved the soundtrack. I wanted to have this peaceful and inspiring music to play at home. It's the music from the movie and completely met my expectations. Such beautiful music.
B000OLROWC|5.0|Watched this film when it was in theatres back in 1984. led me to take 5 years of karate. Loved it then. Love it now.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have so enjoyed being able to use my Android and Kindle in conjunction with each other. I really enjoy that the Android I can read at night as lit up. I have the original Kindle and did not want to buy the new one that had this ability.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|The trailers, I think, completely misdirect you on what Iron Man 3 is going to be about.  The trailers make you think that there's going to be the big Iron Man-Mandarin fight that's been teased since the Ten Rings were introduced in the first Iron Man movie.  You're made to believe that Tony Stark needs to make all of those new armors to take down the Mandarin.<br /><br />Guess what?!?  Shane Black has decided to give a big middle finger to the comic book fans, and then try to make some movie that means something to him; creates tons of new product to license; and appeals to little kids.  If you have seen the movie, you know what I mean.  Shane Black has, I think, completely ruined the Iron Man movie franchise.  The only great thing about Iron Man 3, I think, was the post-credits scene.  The post-credits scene was the only thing that stopped me from asking for a full refund.<br /><br />Disney and Marvel, if you are reading this, DO NOT ever, ever let Shane Black work on any Marvel movie in the future!  If I was Disney and Marvel right now, I would grovel and ask for forgiveness from comic book fans.  I would give whatever money Robert Downey Jr. wanted, while assuring Downey Jr. that Iron Man 4 will not have a little kid steal the spotlight and have a showdown between Iron Man and a major comic book villain.  Disney and Marvel should let the door kick Shane Black and then tell this guy never to come back!<br /><br />Yes, I was so disgusted and disappointed with Iron Man 3 that I'm not going to buy any disc release or digital download release.<br /><br />If you thinking about seeing Iron Man 3, cancel your movie tickets and get a full refund!  Turn back now!<br /><br />Thank God that Shane Black has nothing to do with Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: Winter Soldier, or Avengers 2.
0307950654|1.0|Too many characters, not a compelling story line, and I thought quite boring, but had to read it for my book club.  .
B00CEF014E|5.0|I was asked to read and review this story by its author and was delighted to do so.  Solstice is a fast-paced, full of action tale, which draws in the reader at once.  It's full of mystery and well-written so that the characters are believable, so much so that it enhances the plot, where the reader is embroiled in how the story is going to end.<br /><br />I don't give spoilers, but will say that this is a tale full of twists, turns and not altogether predicable.<br /><br />Certainly worth reading.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The alarm clock application is one of the more useful apps I have downloaded onto my kindle fire.  So easy even a 50 year old can use it without the aid of a teenager.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I did not care much for it. I have lost my intrest in moves that feature so much killing and violence.
1452110581|4.0|Writer could have done a better job on some of the &#34;poems&#34; and given some more thought to what the content was. It's a nice little (and I mean little as the book is about 5 inches tall) book to have on the coffee table and cat lovers will laugh.
B000IZ9UEY|5.0|As always Tommy Lee plays a good part. The plot holds your intrest up to the end. Some violence but not much.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It was one of those movies I thought I would have to sit through to even up for the action movies I make my wife watch and I I was spell bound. I would rate it in my top half dozen movies of all time.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|It is a very nice book I wish the author would have said more about the hearing ad's after he lost them
B00932A4XE|5.0|With the reviews and the quickness this movie seemed to go from Theater to DVD to nothing, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it, but it was free due to my Prime account, and I finally gave in.  Now, this has to be one of my favorites. I did not realize Dennis Quaid was in the movie - so that was nice to see and I loved his character. Cameron Diaz was a spaz, but she always is. But Jennifer Lopez is becoming one of my all time favorite movie actresses.  Good movie.
B009HOU672|5.0|I love Vivaldi's Four Seasons. I have several versions, from I Musici to Perlman or Mutter. I know it by heart... but it's a pleasure to hear this new recreation. I recommended it
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game is pretty easy to get the hang of, but does get boring if you are really trying to play. If you are just passing time, like in a hospital room, it's a great little game.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|i saw this movie in blue-ray & thought this would be great in 3d. well, i was right. this is GREAT in 3d. everyone should see it, it will blow you away.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you like Angry birds or Star Wars, Buy this game!! It has the best of both worlds! Gameplay is unchanged.
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|This is quite frankly one of the most beautiful albums I have EVER listened to.<br /><br />The melodies are very beautiful and they flow together so well.<br /><br />I gave this album a 9.6 out of 10 because it just pieces together into beautiful textures.<br /><br />BUY IT
B001S86J0I|4.0|My kids, ages 16 and 12, really liked this movie. I thought it was different and pretty funny myself. We have watched it a couple of times.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love to be able to access my eBay account through my Kindle. While I don't use it for everything, i do use it to keep tabs on what I am selling. So far it works great!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Daniel Day was exceptional as Lincoln .A view of the what it takes to get a &#34;Bill&#34; thru  congress!<br />Mary Todd Lincoln was  very well portrayed by Sally Field
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Problems with teenagers ? Goes way back, as we will see. But, families sticking toghether will come thru in the end. with a few problems, pirates, etc.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids love monsters, ghosts, etc.... this was a very cute movie that I felt comfortable letting everyone watch. My kids are 3 & 5. They also like Paranorman... but- I prefer this one. I feel it is more age appropriate.
B001FB55YE|5.0|It's a guy richie flick and in my mind runner up for his all time best. Must have in any collection.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|Good movie.  Again, not the Notebook.  :)  My husband loved it, looking forward to getting him Ip Man 3.  Even my daughter liked it, sends a message.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|Crashes and doesn't even run on my Note II. Glad I didn't pay for it! I found quite a few free ones that do the same thing.
B00825921I|4.0|The story of Mary Yelland who journeys to the isolated, desolate moors to live with her Aunt Patience and her Uncle Joss Merlyn, the wonderfully sinister landlord of Jamaica Inn. Isolated and remote, Jamaica Inn has a well deserving nefarious reputation, a haven where no honest traveller will stop.<br /><br />It's a gothic, atmospheric tale involving smugglers, murder and windswept moors. Unfortunately for Mary she is unable to turn a blind eye to the shady goings on at the Inn under the cover of darkness. The strength of this novel lies with the author's descriptions of the desolate, lonely Cornish coast. It's a suspenseful period piece of a bygone era.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Trashy. So much hype about it but nothing new.  Don' t we have enough violence in our world today?  Stop publishing this stuff
0425252868|5.0|As a retired Air Force fighter pilot, I loved this book. It’s a profound account of one of World War Two’s most unique aerial combat episodes. The author has done a magnificent job in portraying the life and times of an American bomber pilot and a German fighter pilot. It’s a must read for both aviation and history enthusiasts.
B003XJDT1W|5.0|Very good music. This CD is a mix of upbeat and slower tempo songs. Emotional and fun all in one!
B000Z27HLS|5.0|It is entertaining.  It had a plot.....<br />I dislike a movie that is violent.  Today's movies are a total mess.  nik *.*
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son and I are addicted to this game!  It's fun but also makes you use your mind to solve the puzzles.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Getting into the intrigue, good cop, bad cop, politics, gangs.  A little for everyone.  Hope the good guys win out in the end.  Not there yet.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|As a newbie to full frame photographing, this book give me many  aha experience.<br />Thanks for this book Bryan.<br /><br />Roger.<br />from Norway
B00821OX98|5.0|Loved the series, good action packed drama, and good acting, kept me coming back for more. Good story line as well.
B00C1C0WCQ|4.0|My son enjoyed it and we watched it with him.  It was more interesting than I thought it would be.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Wow! I waited a long time in great anticipation for this movie. then I sadly realize that it is average at best. The dwarves that invade Bilbo's home to start the adventure stay and stay and set and set and eat and eat and talk and talk and I wanted to go to sleep. This movie took forever to get going. Has way to many lulls where absolutely nothing is happening. Unlike Frodo and brave Sam, Bilbo Baggins is wimpy and afraid of his shadow through most of the movie. He does finaly draw his sword in defense od his comrades toward the end. I am glad I only rented this for $3.99. I willnot be so anxious for the next one. This movie is ok but nowhere near Lord of The Rings.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Really excellent album, really dynamic. I'm personally not a big FOB fan my wife is so she had me not only purchase it but I was also forced to listen to it on a very consistent basis. It's riddled with catchy &#34;poppyness&#34; that leaves you humming FOB tunes hours after listening to the album. But unlike other FOB albums I found that I rally enjoyed this album,
B001NLKT60|5.0|Thos book is incredible! Just as good s tge first one if not better! Can't wait to read the third one! Wish he was still with us writing these masterpieces!!
B00881PTRC|4.0|The cartoon graphics are fun to watch.  I have found myself losing just to see what happens. The hangman game is well worth what you pay for the fun you have.
B00B2QG3K2|3.0|I've been a big fan of Paramore for several years, but this album may be the end of that. The songs on this album meander aimlessly, and don't seem to flow very well from one to the next as you're listening. In addition, not a single song was memorable. None of them have the same catchiness that Paramore was so wonderful at. I really wanted to like this, it just didn't do anything for me.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I liked it,but it lacked a little detail.Read it anyways,because it is a good Bible-based series and it is very magical.Go Narnia!:)  (P.S.-is even good for ages 3-6!)
0805092447|5.0|It is a favorite in our family. Eric Carle books always have superiour book binding, beautiful illustration and written at the appropriate level for a child.  Children relate to them and like to hear them over and over again.
0385394233|5.0|A must read for someone who is in the corporate world. Very important for women but men can also receive excellent pearls from this book on working and promoting women.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Stephen E. Ambrose is an excellent writer, and he put together a really compelling story about the guys in E Co. The movie is good, but not as good as the book!
1446303314|4.0|I love Tone's books.  I have almost all of them.  Fun to look at even if you don't make the projects.  Sometimes the directions are a bit hard to follow if you are not an experienced sewer but worth the effort.  I've made many of her projects over the years.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|fell asleep three times not enouph action not what I thout it was going to be about how about the war
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is awesome because of all the cool towers this is my favorite app and is a very good thing to play in the car on the way home so buy the game and have fun
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I am not sure about this movie because I have not watched it yet. However, from what I have heard about it I am sure I will love it.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|This show is very well written.  I have not given it 5 stars due to being less than impressed with some of the acting.  The story flows well and the action is compelling.<br /><br />I am enjoying the story immensely.  The dark hero rather than the typical expectations.  The character strives to find balance between expectations and promises he made.  Overall a very good show.  I plan to continue watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome I love subway surfers it is the  best game ever<br />Gdsgddhdhgxvffh goal horns y net goal horn brguimond@hotmail no
B000002HJR|5.0|I got this album when I was a Junior in High School, an impossibly long time ago. I listened to this record OVER and OVER again. It was just amazing. The only song that I was not entirely fond of was 'Swan Song'. The biggest problem with this record is that I do not know what to call my favorite song. Lifer? Rehab? Stone the Crow? Underneath Everything? Losing All? And the crowd-favorite, Bury Me in Smoke? It is honestly a record that contains 8 or 9 songs that are good enough to be singles. I have many friends who I have got to become fans of this album (with no effort) who do not even like metal. Even after years of owning it, it is still the album that I go back to when I have no new music.<br /><br />This is, perhaps, a bold claim, but I think that this is the crowning achievement of all respective band members. I love Pantera, Corrosion, and Eyehategod (not a fan of Crowbar) but I still feel confident in saying this.<br /><br />I think that if this album were released under the Pantera name then there would be absolutely no debate that Pantera was the best band of the era. NOLA is that good.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|grat clasic movie l nielson great robbie the robot wish i had one grat spc affects not to scary for kids
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It helps me stay in touch while I am on my tablet or phone.  Which is great since I keep up with a lot of family on it.  And it makes up loading pics for everyone to see quick and easy.
030758836X|2.0|A book club selection I wish I'd skipped, based entirely on the story line. It was well written and did hold my attention - kind of like the car chase on TV that you don't want to watch, but can't make yourself turn off. I found myself alternating my sympathy between both characters, depending on whose POV the story was being told. In the end, I just felt chumped and sucked into sympathizing with such sick people. As I said it was well written, but I really want to feel some sense of hope when I finish a book. This book left me dark.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|This works great!  I love how they've provided a decent user experience by mapping touch gestures to remote mouse functions.  This is definitely one of the rare apps that'll be on my list of must-haves.<br /><br />The RDP functionality is great.<br /><br />It did die on me once during my 10 minute test, hence the 4 starts instead of 5.
B0072OFM28|5.0|The price was much better than in stores and it was brand new. It was a gift from my wife and a great surprise.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|She's a great actress and a wonderful singer....I wish her a long and happy career and life: she deserves it!
B003TH2LYY|5.0|If you like buddy cop shows, this one is the best. Castle and Beckett play off better against one another than Bones, the Mentalist, Psych or Life. There is sexual tension but they don't give in to it, nor make it dominate the story. There is backstory but they are not obsessed with it. And it is genuinely funny.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I gave this book four stars for a brilliant imagination, approach to story telling, and sheer madness. Read with the lights on.
0374214913|5.0|I am a library reader and reserved this book last year based on a review I'd read somewhere.  I must say that I almost returned it unread but, shortly before it was due to be returned, I picked it up and was enthralled.  The book is beautifully crafted and edited and is a great read.  It combines a love story with a coming-of-age tale and has shades of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings along with hints of Futureworld .  The author is a young techie (I had to learn more about him!) who has a marvelous touch with a pen- or keyboard.  The book is clever (a young woman's attempt to read a newspaper was one of my favorite sections) and lets the reader decide about how much we are losing with all the e-technology as compared to OK (old knowledge).  I am an &#34;old knowledge&#34; person myself but I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book.  It is now in my permanent collection and I will reread it many times!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|To be fair, I haven't yet read this book.  I've been very disappointed in the last few Cornwell books I've spent hard earned cash on, so I am checking out the comments.  I get the impression a trip to the free library may be in order...
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|nice app, but it is not comfortable to use on tablet as it has only front cam there are difficulties in operating such cam
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|Having been stuck in &#34;historical romance&#34; for some time, I have no idea how I came across this series, but I am very pleased that I did.  Still set in century past, it's witty, whimsical and provocative.  Strong female characters balanced by interesting male counterparts.  Sci-fi mixed with adventure, vampires, and werewolves.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfers is a very fun temple run style game. Because of its quick pace and fun gadgets I actually prefer this to temple run. But it loses a lot of points for one main thing. IN GAME PURCHASES. This game bombards you trying to make you buy ridiculously priced dlc packs. I saw one coin pack for $99.99. The new key system is just another way to make you spend real money. I used two keys in one game and it cost me three. Turns out that using a key doubles the cost of another respawn which means hardcore players will be FORCED to spend on it. So its a very fun and addictice game but please don't fall for its insane micro transactions. Because one million virtual coins is defientley not worth one hundred real dollars
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is a great time killer. it keeps my brain busy for hours at a time when the rest of the house is asleep and I need to be quiet. this game is not just a quick day and the game is beat. well worth the time and keeps adding new and fun twists so its not the same boring thing time and time again.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Complex characters with strengths and flaws continually learning about each other.  No one dementional characters or plots.  :)  I highly recomend this series of books.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We had purchased a different mobile first, and had to exchange it because when the animals turned, they got stuck against the back of the mobile. We didn't have that problem at all with this one. The animals turn just fine, the music sounds great and our daughter loves it. There are settings so you can have just the mobile, just the music, or both. At night, we just use the music for her to soothe her to sleep. For naptime and other times, we'll use the mobile. It is a nice feature. The music plays for a good amount of time and the four different options are good.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Wonderful movie, it felt like re-watching the actual footage of the tsunami..very intense..the visuals were stunning, if not a bit disturbing..overall, a very good movie.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The business book of the decade, if not decades! An absolute must read for any working woman, and working man!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|CDs---this is simply fine rock, very strong \\"head\\" music for my circle of friends back in the day. Also must've been one of Stevie Ray Vaughn's favorites also---try it, believe you'll love it!!
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|this movie totally ruled.  I held back watching it for a couple years after being horrified by what they did to Clash of the Titans, but was pleasantly surprised by how awesome this movie was
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|They may have been written over 100 years ago but the stories of Louisa May Alcott are timeless and as readable today as they were when they were fresh off the press. If you have never read her stories, I urge you to do so.
B0086700CM|3.0|You'd better be ready for a test of your reflexes for this game. It takes a little getting used to.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series, it takes you back in time where things were so beautiful and proper. The costumes, the cars<br />the scenery.  I think I would loved to live in those days.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|If you play Bingo Blitz on Facebook, there will be a couple things different on the Kindle edition. First, the website upgrades a lot faster than the Kindle. Second, the Kindle is a little harder, even with a pen, to play. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun.
B0076DELIG|5.0|What can you say about 30 year career with Dectective Bosch in LAPD. Connelly books are factual but fun to read.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has done it again!!  This was yet another beautiful and amazing story by Kate!  I really enjoyed the story line.  This book keeps you guessing and is a beautiful and interesting picture of love, secrets and perceptions.  An amazing story.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|But I don't know! They don't have word restrictions so people can say what every they won't, and people don't care. And they can post what they won't to so I do recommend it for kids!!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|While it is true that the singing is not what it is on the stage.  Still this was very well done.  It felt much more personal, real and emotional.  It was heartbreaking and beautiful.  This was a wonderfully done take on an amazing story.  Anne Hathaway is heartbreaking.  The entire cast is well selected and very &#34;real&#34;  If you haven't seen this yet it is worth a watch.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|kept my interest almost as well as Lost, but character developement and continuity of episodes not as good as Lost.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I really enjoyed &#34;The Maze Runner&#34; it was a faced paced book and the other two books in the series were entertaining too although I enjoyed the fist book the most.  This book however was just not as good.  It is still an interesting story and well written but it just didn't grab me quite like &#34;The Maze Runner&#34; did.  It is a somewhat sad story with an unexpected ending.  It was still a good read just not as good as the others.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|hunger games began slow and wierd like science fiction, but soon the main characters developed to the point of caring about them somewhat.  seemed an allegory of recent wars, begun by old rich guys, but fought by young people in search of false heroism.  saddest part was the vicarious voyeristic involvement by the audience through media exploitation.
B004J64QR4|5.0|This is Les Mis in concert.  There are costumes and some scenery to help you to get a feel for things.  This is a beautiful production.  I was not aware that Marius was played by one of the Jonus (sp) brothers until much later since I really don't even know who the Jonus brothers are. The funny thing is that I really liked Marius.  I thought he seemed like a kid in love and in war and he did a great job.  He could have been better on &#34;Rain will make the flowers grow&#34; duet but he was amazing on &#34;empty chairs at empty tables&#34;  I could imagine him as this heartbroken young guy that Marius is.  I loved the inn keeper and his wife.  There were funny and entertaining but not too over the top.<br />All in all I really enjoyed this!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have never read this, but it was recommended to me all the time.  Finally I broke down and bought it, and I was not let down!  It is a great story that really pulls you in.  Now I guess I have to read the entire series!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is one of our new favorites!  This is a fun story and all the modern little &#34;gamers&#34; will be able to appreciate the video game aspect of the story.  This is a funny and clever movie.  The message is an important and clear one.  The music is fun and the characters are relatable and loveable.  Give this one a try!
B001DM1VXE|5.0|Movie is at best, odd.  BUT...it's worth the watch.  Just allow yourself two bags of popcorn - buttered would be best for this flick.
B003QSMC18|4.0|This is a beautiful movie with a nice moral and interesting story but it is a little scary in some parts.  There is a lot of voodoo references and there are dark spirits at the end of the movie that may be scary for some kids.  We didn't care for the voodoo aspect at all.  It was a bit darker then many of the other princess movies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this book after hearing much of the hype and therefore had high expectations. It's a good story and definitely an above average read but I wouldn't say amazing. Worth reading? Yes.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was a story I can imagine being very relatable for most high school aged kids.  There are some sexual aspects to the book but they are also things that are very real in the age group the book deals with.<br />What sort of difference do our choices make in other people's lives?  How harmless are the &#34;harmless&#34; things that we do and say?<br />This book deals with the heavy topic of suicide from the point of view of the person that has given up all hope.  It is a well told story and it keeps you interested while giving you a lot to think about.  I really recommend this book for not just the subject matter but for the changes you may want to make after reading it.
076790592X|5.0|I read this book for an outside read in my English class and to my surprise, I absolutely love it. The philosophical ideas that Morrie presents in this work are unprecedented. He puts human life into perspective for a culture that does not handle dying well. Morrie is an aspirational figure from the first page of the book, where you learn about that his philosophy is one of a kind. The meaning of life to Morrie is more than just living and dying. It is living in the \\"now\\" and not fixating the mind on the past. Tuesdays with Morrie really does make one think about the bigger picture of life and the world as a whole. After reading a few chapters, I became detached, as Morrie might say, from my problems in life. This is an outstanding book for anyone to read to see the bigger picture of life. I would recommend this novel to anyone that is interested in philosophy, looking for a storyline in their works. It is also an easy read so the book will breeze by.
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|This is a classic.  I loved it as a little girl and my children love it too.  It is fun and funny and magical.  A Disney classic at it's best.
B009JZVT70|5.0|The story lines and character development are very well written.  The way all of the different fairy tales are tied together is very imaginative.  This is a very entertaining series.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Lois Lowry does an amazing job of pulling you into a world that is actually difficult to relate to.  It really makes you think and consider how it would be to be a part of this world.<br />How do you explain the color Red to someone that has never seen a color?  What about warm to someone that has never been cold?  Or high to someone that has never been low?<br />Where do you think Jonas ends up?<br />Such a good book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Creative mode is awesome according to a boy under ten.  He just keeps building and building, using his imagination and building.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Young boy under ten said he had a hard time getting through the last level which he called Stone Age.
B000T433CO|5.0|To remind me to enjoy life and that when we don't get what we want it is probably because there is something even better for us!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love it -- it's fun and sometimes I even break my own time record.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|I've watched just about the whole series on Netflix. It's interesting only for its nostalgic value (because I hail from that period and have worked on Madison Avenue) but oddly it doesn't cause nostalgia in me because there's a modern, contemporary element in the series, in all the characters and in the various episodes (and it has a billion and a half directors for each episode), that sours it. I've reached Season 4, episode 13, and was not surprised to see the anti-cigarette ploy. I don't particularly like the character of Don Draper aka Dick Whitman; he doesn't seem to have a self because of his dishonesty in stealing Whitman's identity in Korea. He's too angst-ridden and has a continuing series of problems that seem pretty banal. You really don't know why he has all the sex he does (and he has almost as many women as he has cigarettes and bourbons and whiskeys, practically nonstop) and it's never explained why he needs sex so much.<br /><br />Jon Hamm would be a great Hank Rearden, the industrialist, in a remake of Atlas Shrugged, if the people in charge of casting for that disaster had any marbles. But as Don Draper, he's just literally a selfless entity in search of a self. As a slice of lavishly produced Naturalism, the series is marvelously cast and otherwise well done. It doesn't hold a candle, however, to movies that deal with internal conflicts such as \\"Leave Her to Heaven.\\" One thing I do miss and which the series recreates is the women's clothing styles, which were sexier.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|As a grandmother, I would not want the young ones reading this. It would be to graphic. They need to be innocent for as long as they they can in &#34;this&#34; real life.  Suzanne captured and described each scene very well. It was easy to keep reading to the end.  I truly enjoy reading how one over comes....using their wits to get by, taking advantage of the resources available to them. Yes, I will have to find the next book and see how it plays out. Thank you for a good read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a five star rated game that really brings out your inner child. It has so many thrills and exciting features like in Tokyo you have to get types of tokens( twenty-five each week for five weeks in a row) to get a prize at the end of each week that you participate in.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I really enjoy the &#34;bones&#34; series of books.  They are well written and realistic.  I like all the characters in the series.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|As a father of five daughters, i'll have each of my girls read this one so they understand why I've pushed them as hard as I have over the years. The first few chapters had me. I highlighted a number of comments and observations. I barely made it through the rest of the book because it seemed to focus heavily on the same topic. As a 43 year old mid-level leader in a historically male driven industry, I felt the need to better understand.  I have a better understanding. Thank you.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A beautiful, emotionally charged cd. Well worth the price. Instrumental music at its best! The Piano Guys are amazingly talented! Recommend wholeheartedly!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Took a few episodes to get into it. Thought the pilot was good but didn't totally make me feel like the 3 main characters were headed towards being a team. Knocked a star off because every episode has some really gross scene to the point of gratuitous ness.  Abrams could have toned those scenes down a degree or not subjected us to that every single episode.  Otherwise good characters and plot. Walter is my favorite of the 3.
B008NMT684|5.0|My toddler really loves this Game. He will play it all day. The sound effects are soo cute. Worth the download
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book really makes you think about never eating anything with wheat in it again! I personally experienced a smaller tummy when I stopped eating wheat.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever i love it its so fun the horses are adorible! Its deffinetely something id reccomand to all of my friends
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|Interesting and intriguing<br />Very interesting, is a film to reflect. Robert Pattinson's performance is great, he is such a good actor.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun and entertaining although there are a few quirks like the screen not always responding to touch commands. Overall, the designers did a great job with the graphics and the &#34;stories&#34; that go along with each quest. Seems like there is always something new to discover. If it weren't for the few bugs, this would have received 5 stars.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I recently watched this movie twice...great both times.  I love the high emotional drama and dynamics between the characters...the disfunction was real and the characters were like every day life. I found myself relating to the family and the ups and downs. Jacki Weaver tugs at your heart as a mother who is only trying to help her son but gets caught in the middle of a lot of conflict.  Bradley Cooper was believable in his role (I was impressed)...and Robert DeNiro doesn't disappoint.  Jennifer Lawrence definitely deserved her Academy award for this one.  (watch her in Winter's Bone) This young lady can act.
0307950689|1.0|Why did everyone have to go through all that crap and all those people have to die if the book the entire time WAS THE FREAKING BIBLE?!?!? I've got like 6 of them in my house. I would have given the bad guy one no problem.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can do any thing on it there are no limits and super addicting! U would be stupid not 2 get it!FYI SUPER FUN 2 play with friends. U can blow stuff up and do not even get me started on Horobrine!
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Good movie. Predictable but still fun to watch. Of course Sam Jackson is great as Coach! If your a fan you'll enjoy it!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I don't always buy products on Amazon. But, when I do... I make it on Amazon Mobile. Not the most interesting app in the world. But, very convenient.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is awesome because u can mostly do what u want to do and its free. You also get to buy what u want when u want it.
0312370849|5.0|The book was a gift for a dear friend. After she read and raved about this book I had to borrow it and read it too. Couldn't put it down although I must say there were times the tears fell and I had to put it down before I could continue. Worth reading, worth the tears.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great for planning what to build on regular version of Minecraft. But you can only do so much. You can't build portals and livestock doesn't respawn. You also seem to be unable to change your skin in this version of Minecraft. But it's not all that bad.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I was absolutely loving the first half of this audio book, the first few hours I was just as enthusiastic about it as the many reviewers that have given it such high ratings. The story revolves around a massive underground silo with over 140 floors (can't remember exactly how many). The air is poisoned outside and the silo is a giant self-contained world, there are so many floors that people take several days to get from one end to the next. Hugh Howey sets this world very well and I instantly became entranced with the world he described.<br /><br />I won't go into too much detail as it would be easy to spoil the plot but the story seriously bogs down in the second half. The story tends to take turns concentrating on individual characters and a substantial part of the second half of the book revolves around Juliette and quite frankly I found her story a little on the tedious side. I would find myself zoning out and not paying attention for several minutes as the author took way too much time describing, for instance, the character swimming around water. The tone also changed from an action packed sci-fi thriller to more of a melodramatic teen novel. It was like I started reading Robert Heinlein and ended up with Stephanie Meyer.<br /><br />That said, the world he envisioned is truly original and the narrator does a great job with the voices of the different characters.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this was  A very great book and I loved  it and it helped me realize a lot of things I recommend this to people who want to read a fantastic book or who are going through a tough time and need  to remember we are all infinite :)
B00BBQXQFI|3.0|A decent movie, but the plot is not especially engaging. Fine for kids though.<br /><br />Nothing too intense for young ones, although a strong theme of nightmares / dreams throughout might make bedtime a little more of a hassle for some.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love it is like the best game ever I would recommend it to anybody it is so fun and addicting
0887431453|5.0|I ordered these for my daughter is 3 to supplement what she is learing in pre school and loves doing these workbook pages. The pages are super colorful which I think is a nice feature.

B009R659L8|5.0|Another wonderful story from Mary Higgins Clark.  True to form...full of suspense and excellent character development.  It's a real &#34;page-turner&#34; !
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A book about zombies from Mel Brooks' son should be like Blazing Saddles with the undread right?  Wrong.  This novel is less about zombies and more about how people and societies react to unthinkable disaster.  As it turns out, mankind and its institutions may not be very well prepared for the next catastrophe - the thing that destroys humanity may not be global warming, nuclear war or avian flu, but something we can't imagine and aren't prepared to deal with.  This is an intelligent, thought provoking work of fiction.  (Diclaimer: I think Blazing Saddles is by far the funniest movie ever made).
B0007Q6QVO|5.0|I am a big fan of melanie c , I'm glad I bought it because my favorite songs from the album are better alone and the next best super star. Fast shipping. I would recommend this to a friend.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game my 4 yr old son enjoys. It is challenging as the character goes faster it is harder to control which makes the game more interesting. I love it
1451627297|5.0|I'm losing sleep as I read this book, because i can't put it down! An excellent, suspenseful read! The descriptions of 1958 are amazing!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does all that I need and is a good calculator. Needed a calculator that did the necessities and this does it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy working a puzzle when I am waiting.  Since I can choose the number of pieces for each puzzle, I can choose a size that fits the time I have.  There is a big selection of free puzzles and other sets are very low cost.  The only problem I have is that sometimes the pieces do not want to scroll.  The photos are like postcards.  These are for older children or adults.  They are not for young children.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Never thought it would be like a temple run its like a how far u can go with story missions kinda like that
B005LAJ16I|2.0|Let me say this, the first 8 episodes are captivating and worth the purchase.  Then, things rapidly deteriorate.  The story becomes convoluted, the episodes filled with fluff and it appears that the writers are leaning away from pro-America, more towards the Israeli point of view. While we were initially looking forward to season 2, now, we wont bother with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|support didn't did find details do differently free stuff here from free get game<br /><br />good day Norway Jesus McDonald's burger king
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a very good game and kept you on your toes to figure out the next puzzle. Solved it in one day but it's because you can't put it down! Worth every penny and plan on buying the next one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very spellbinding..I couldn't put it down. Christian and Ana have a love that can't be touched..l can't wait to read book two.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think that Hugh Howey is the best sci-fi author of this generation.  I read this book as an e-book, and then drove to another county for a book signing of the hard copy of this book because I just had to have it on my sparcely filled book shelf.  Be warned, you will be addicted.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Awesome game.my every morning starts with a stick tennis daily challenge. Wish there could be some more free games. Thinking of buying it actually.
143353083X|5.0|dont understand why the paperback is so much cheaper than the hardback. the commentary definitely helps with my daily devotions.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|When I heard about the line up for Ringo's 2012 All Starr band I was very excited that some of my most favorite musicians were in the band...  Namely Todd, Luke, and Joe.  Unfortunately the tour did not venture anyplace close enough for us to get to the show, so I was absolutely thrilled when I found my way to this DVD.  I've only watched it once so far, but I enjoyed it so much that I really can't wait to watch it again.  The entire band was made up of front men, all heavyweights.  You could tell that they all loved the experience of playing together very much, and that they all loved and respected each other as artists.  I can only imagine what a thrill it must have been to be a member of the band.  A thrill that was definitely shared by all in attendance and even those who were not in attendance who could only watch it on DVD...  I love a good concert video, and this one is a new favorite for me.  The song selections were excellent, most of which are very likely to be the best &#34;live&#34; renditions that you will ever see or hear.  I sure hope that Ringo keeps doing this every summer.
0375869026|5.0|My 11 year old loved it! It was required reading at her school . It was an excellent story with a great message.

B001NXDSLQ|5.0|this is a good dvd concert from woodstock . my only observation is that this dvd has different songs then the original woodstock concert film .
B00C0NFMKI|1.0|Not sure what went wrong here, sounds like some guys left the band? i'm not a country music fan...I'm not a folk music fan...and this album is a mix of both...I'm sure they're still very talented, they just put out one terrible album...
B000IFQLSW|5.0|another new gun in the blues . this is a great story , cd and dvd . lots of blues by kws and some old blues masters . not to be missed
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This has more levels, more characters, more candy, and more fun. It is definitely t he best Cut The Rope game so far. Totally worth your 99 cents!

B008Y73940|4.0|I read the book and it was pretty gripping.  This stayed pretty close to the book, and is well worth watching
B003R5C5JE|5.0|Bought this for my brother for his birthday, he's planning on putting it on his desk at work. Its got all the features you'd hope for in a replica; flux capacitor, Mr. Fusion, etc. My only problem is that it was hard to give away because I liked it so much.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|ALWAYS wanted to watch this movie wen young , and I'm was not defrauded ...still one of the favorites. love it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers was a very FUN game. When you play it in the car it may be a little nauseating but.....
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I never thought that business related topics usually found in some management books or how-to guides could be written in an action packed novel. Great job!<br />From my point of view it surely is refreshing to rewrite plentiful of guides as action packed novels. This way I can surely better relate my situations to a set-up in a novel and easier remember lessons  that should be learned and adopted.<br /><br />I really appreciate this novel approach to teaching.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it is an awesome game when people find out its free the money would prob. go up to like 6.99
006079383X|5.0|A Classic!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book overall was absolutely stunning. It was just the right amount of mystery, cunning personalities, and psychotic outbreaks. But, I'm still contemplating whether I like the ending or not. That's the only reason I give it four stars instead of five.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I expected a more complete end to a saga that was drawn out way too long. Too many story lines not completely & characters left in complete.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think wonder is a great book. The charters really pay a good part, and lots of coming back and not for getting. I hope this author series more books on wonder. It's really just like my school.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|the only thing is. It takes long to build up gold should get more for level completion. other then that great game 5 stars really!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is amazing! I would highly recommend it to fans of Temple Run. It is a super fun game!

0812993845|5.0|I like every book that Sophie Kinsella has written, but her latest book, \\"Wedding Night\\" is my favorite, so far! The older sister, Fliss, loves her younger sister very much, but she's always needed to be a mother substitute to her, and in this book Fliss carries out her need to protect her sister waaay too far!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent story line delving into the sick mind of an individual and how well the wife was coping with it.  First book read by Nicholas Sparks but will seek out more.

B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I randomly chose an album based on some friends' recommending the band. I totally love Wretched & Divine. I've been listening to it for two weeks now. :) Once payday rolls around I'll pick up another album or two.
B000FP2OPY|2.0|Disk one freezes and skips. it plays episode one fine, then episode two freezes and locks up. theres a issue with the disk i guess. all the other disks play fine. i should have bought strait from amazon. if i want a refund i have to jump through hoops with the vendor that fulfilled the order. ill just deal with not having season one, episode 2.
B0060AY85C|5.0|This was a book chosen for our book club.  It really was a great read and gave some incite on human siturations back in the day and surprise and gasping momets as well. EET
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Excellent entertainment. Well made movie. Amazed to find out tiger is mostly animated.<br />Everyone who watched this at our house liked it.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I watched August Rush for the first time on a Sunday late-afternoon while flicking through TV channels. Of course, I didn't caught it from the beginning, and that happened every time since, whenever I found it on TV. I decided to purchase the DVD, not only because I wanted to watch it in its entirety for once and for all but also because it had always touched me from the middle onwards, which was always the part caught by me.<br /><br />Evan's life-journey, with the music inside him leading the way, had kind of a sad and beautiful impact on me. Another thing that allowed watching the movie from the beginning is that I was finally able to understand all the musical connections between Lyla, Louis and August. You could say that not being able to caught a movie right from the start takes some of its magic away. But in this case it was the opposite, because every time I became aware of a harmonic blending between two different performances or theme that eventually becomes part of August's Rhapsody, I couldn't help but cheering those special moments.<br /><br />August Rush is a great movie all by itself. But being a musician and music lover too I felt the experience to be much greater than watching any other movie that has a complete different topic. So I recommend this DVD to anybody who'd like to witness a fairy-tale story and be soared by touching melodies.
B0002DB52M|3.0|This movie was recommended by a friend. I didn't like the way it was made. There weren't any real sets. It looked more like an amateur play in a school auditorium. The plot was just okay but it took several times viewing because it didn't hold my attention.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is addicting. I just wish it didnt take to long to fill up the engery. Other than that its good.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|What a cute little game.  I am a saltwater fanatic so I thought I would give this a try.  Great way to teach my granddaughter about the ocean!!!!
0762434279|1.0|At the end of the description it says \\"miniature edition\\". It's really tiny. It is 120 pages. 120 tiny, tiny pages. It's also tiny.
B009R659L8|5.0|Typical MHClark book. Kept me guessing.  Loved it. Would recommend to anyone.  Another book under your belt.  Keep them coming
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Story is still redundant, but picks up a little more than the 1st one which adds some interest. More storyline drama helped.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I grew up watching this on reruns after school and still love it today. Is it campy? Yes, but that is part of the fun!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Well written, loved the characters, based on true historial events. Very enjoyable read. I would try more of Klines books after this one.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Not much of a challenge and the clues are very grammer school. I would only buy this if you are going to let a 1st or 2nd grader play it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this episode was especially good! the quality was great and no commercials!!! can't beat that! nothing else to say about it.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|It is okay....I wish there were an easier way to get clues.  It would be better if there was a &#34;cheat&#34; app, like a few other games.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I enjoyed reading this true account. The perspective of a &#34;regular&#34;(non-Nazi, spiritual) German pilot was interesting. My book club gave it a high rating.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This was a great, awesome book, what I liked most about the book was how they mixed some Spanish with English, and of course the story of a gang member (Alex) who falls in love with a rich girl who doesn't want nothing to do with them, and she ends falling in love with Alex. I would recommend this book to anyone. :)
B004SOR4H6|5.0|yeah this app is great! fast download,  updated everyday but. some times it may have some flaws but its still an awesome app! Plus it's free! Buy it today!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My daughter loves all the bright colors!! She can play this game for hrs building the reef and all the different type of fish and plants.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I didn't think I was going to like this book, but ended up thoroughly enjoying it.  I would definitely recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|All I can say its an ok ending no wow.<br />book 2 is the best of the three. The end
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a fabulous book whether you are an introvert or an extrovert who wants to understand introverts better.<br /><br />The depth of knowledge that Cain has, and the references included in this book are all outstanding. (The book officially ends at 74%, according to my Kindle. There's another 26% of notes and references!)<br /><br />I've recommended this book to many friends and clients for two main reasons: 1) It will help you understand yourself better; and 2) It will help you understand others better.<br /><br />And really, what's better than that? =)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book was awesome but I thought that I could of at least ended with them showing up at the hospital to see their mom
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for Season 4.  Not too happy about losing Matthew but I don't think the show will lose any of it's appeal- the story line now has more opportunities to move in some very interesting directions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Definitely a winner. Keeps you coming back; whether it be to collect coins for a new item, to see the changes in scenery, or to kick your friends score in the berries.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love it I wake up gently to a praise song praising our awesome God. Love knowing what the weather is too now
B003V5CFV8|5.0|&#34;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&#34;  is a great way to teach Homer's &#34;The Odyssey&#34; to high school students.  After reading excerpts from &#34;The Odyssey,&#34;  students are able to pick out elements of the classic epic poem.  If you are going to use this movie for the classroom, I advise that you skip through the KKK portion of the film as a few of my students took offense to the scene.
B00CHILW64|3.0|They linger a little too long in each scene in this one, and the music makes it really schmaltzy.  However, the performances are strong, the portrayal of the tsunami is riveting, there is a lot to see here that makes it worth it.  I felt a little exhausted after the movie was done though.  Worth a shot, you might like it more than I did.
B00881VLCE|2.0|The app works but it stops after a day and then you have to download it again and then it will stop again!!:(:(
B000002VMH|5.0|Great CD, Little Bird is very uplifting and fun to sing along with.  Several well know songs in this CD
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Amazing I could read it again..but this time,backwards..words cannot describe the plot twists and  humour involved creating this epic novel
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie is much closer to a dram-edy than a comedy. There are a few parts that are meant to satisfy the teenage audience that usually attends Judd Apatow movies (e.g., fart jokes, breast humor, etc.), but most of it is awkward and uncomfortably real moments between a husband and wife whose troubles with their own families and finances further exacerbates tensions between the two of them. My wife and I bought this movie intending to be a funny throw away for a lighthearted night on the couch, and we ended up needing to find something else to watch afterward to bring our spirits back up.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game but one thing I dislike I couldn't expand my Restaurant because I didn't have neighbors. I invite some but they're not responding on my request. It sucks..<br /><br />Can someone please add me.. Here is my storm ID: jheanna<br />Thank you.. ^_^
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's free!  Fun, good graphics &amp; music, pretty good controls.  Repair times are meant to induce you to purchase more 'Starks' or whatever but also add meaning to game by making failure more punitive.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|If you love DH's, then you'll love this season! This series is very addicting and I love all of these ladies. Worth every penny. : )
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It made me write a review so here i am... but this is an excellent app and gives all the info you may need about your battery... totally worth purchasing
B003F3NDP8|5.0|If you love DH's, then you'll love this season! This series is very addicting and I love all of these ladies. Worth every penny. : )
B0039O8AQK|1.0|This is a remake, and it shows way more than necessary, as far as private stuff that goes on between Winston and Julia, while neglecting content that is in the book and even in the original. I would recommend the original, not this one. Too bad the original is not on Amazon Instant Video.
B00AMOOGJ0|5.0|Great book. My five year old loves it. And, it Looks great on the iPad. Mor convenient than paper book.
B009S33I68|5.0|Down in the dirt action.  It brings you into the field with them.  The book covers the build up to their arrival in country.  And then a few days of their year in country.  It left you to imagine what the rest of their tour of duty could of been like.  I really like the section in the back of the book which gives an update on what they did with their lives after Ia Drang.  I served two tours to Vietnam, and I did nothing like these guys.  We three men in four days during the first deployment.  The lost changed me for the rest of my life and the next 29 years of active duty.  A good read.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, I have not read the books so I am not comparing but I did enjoy it, I'm 28 with 2 babies so watching something with a light hearted attitude is good as well as necessary, I enjoyed the story I am sappy so it was perfect for me, it's cute!  I enjoyed watching it I liked the ending especially watch it but take it as something to watch but not an Oscar winning movie and you'll enjoy it &#60;3
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|I bought this CD for my granddaughter and she loved it and has watched several times since she received it.<br /><br />Thanks
B004FOPFFW|5.0|Bob Dylan is not only a great musician but a great poet.  He is one of the most influential cultural figures and his success as a recognized songwriter is well known.  Dylan has been nominated for a Nobel Prize in Literature every year since 1996. He deserves the prize.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|It is hard to believe in the 'not so distance' past things like that went on.  What a pathetic life that family lead.  Amazing story!
B00CA9Y6Q8|4.0|I picked this up for the single &#34;Green Garden&#34;, but the whole thing is beautiful. The rich production sounds like a perfect sunrise. Her voice sounds like someone who has really lived. A lot of good songs here.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|If you are bored AF and cant find a good game, get this and be amazed. p9 id if Icbm whys
B000V63C4Y|5.0|Really, how could you go wrong? &#34;Jazz Samba&#34; remains my favorite, but this album is pure bliss.<br /><br />There's some repetition for those who already have Astrud Gilberto's greatest hits, but these tunes are worth every penny. Makes me want a martini and a smoking jacket.
B000N7KTBU|5.0|I've set up two of these now, with 320 and 500GB SATA hard drives.  Installation is ridiculously easy and the completed devices run relatively cool and quietly.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Star Trek is quality viewing. Now I can watch any time,any where. Nothing on TV?  I don't care any more.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Does exactly what is says. Only you can't download the same video more than once for the different possible formats.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|I have given 4 Stars because at 4 or 5 Critical Junctures The Sound Level Suddenly goes haywire or gets muffled and Audio-Video Sync is lost.<br />Overall it is a nice movie and pretty fast paced.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is my first trilogy read ever, an the best read in over 30 years, E L James knows just what shes doing  when it comes to women's  books...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have a kindle fire and I love subway surfers! The world tour is so fun. I try to collect the runner from each place. Each month you get to experience a new place, like Tokyo, New York City, or Sydney. It's lots of fun. Because you don't have to tilt the device, I personally like it better than temple run.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Spectacular music.  Love their sounds and play it constantly day and night.  Will advise others of the service and reasonable cost.  Thanks
1616614609|5.0|SYNOPSIS<br />Netrunner is a card game that pits players against each other in the quintessential cyberpunk struggle: the savvy Runner (or hacker) vs a faceless, schemeing mega-Corporation. At its core, the game won or lost by earning points during its course. However, every game has its own narrative that the players experience, which is what I find to be the most appealing aspect of Netrunner.<br /><br />A great deal of emphasis is placed on the fact that this is an asymmetrical card game, and I would be remise to not bring that to the forefront of this review. Each game has players opposite each other in the aforementioned roles of Runner and Corp. Each side of this game plays remarkably different from the other, as the win conditions necessitate. As the Corp, your goal is to advance your schemes and conspiracies under the protection of your computer network and infrastructure. However, in strict opposition, the Runner seeks to liberate those agendas from the clutches of the Corp for whatever gains they might earn from them.<br /><br />Each side has numerous resources at its disposal. The Corp will look to harden their defenses against Runner attacks on their servers by installing ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics). Some of this ICE serves to stop the Runner dead in his tracks. Other ICE might only slow the Runner down while burdening him with resource expenditures, wasted time, or tags so that the Corp can keep close tabs on their future actions and exploit them. Still other, more sinister, ICE is deployed in an effort to cause real damage to the Runner, forcing them to forfeit resources, or potentially lose altogether. The Runner often plays as the aggressor, targetting the Corp's servers in attempts to access the agendas or resources that have been installed. To do so, the Runner utilizes ICE breakers, programs specifically designed to aid in circumventing the defenses that the Corp has put in place. Numerous other programs exist which provide added flexibility to the Runner, whether they be used for misdirection, resource generation, or sheer destruction.<br /><br />After a few games, the dynamic is easy to see. Traditional games or sports could label the sides as offense and defense. However, just as these paradigms start to seem clear, each side can turn them on their heads. Players will begin to recognize that there is no inherent inevitability for one side to win over the other. Just as the Runner might play very aggressivlely, so too can the Corp by laying devious traps for the Runner and exploiting their impulses. In a similar vein, the Runner may not always attack the Corp in a blitzkrieg throughout the game. There are many opportunities for the Runner to carefully build up their rig of programs and execute less, more puposeful runs that are reinforced by mechanics such as accessing additional cards unexpectedly, reducing the strength of defending ICE, or by outright denying the Corp many of it's cherished resources.<br /><br />My absolute favorite aspect of this game is that not only are the playstyles varied by which side of the conflict you're fighting on, but each side has its own factions which add their own special flair and flavor to the game.<br /><br />The Runners are able to personify one of three fascinating personalities: Noise, the Anarch Runner that utilizes viruses and other programs to wreak havoc on the defenses of the Corp; Gabriel Santiago, the Criminal Runner who is in it all for the money, using programs to creep into servers by bypassing key ICE defenses or by forcing the Corp to let him in by deactivating those same defenses; and finally Kate, the Shaper Runner who runs for delight of running and solving problems, with great deals of hardware and programs available at her fingertips to access the secrets of the Corps.<br /><br />The Corps are certainly just as varied. Haas-Bioroid is one of the most influential Corps in this metaverse, installing huge ICE towers with scary defensesthat will punish the Runner at every turn and exercising assets that can give them enourmous advantages later in the game. Weyland, the biggest competitor to HB, utilizes defenses that typically look to slow the Runner down, while also being able to generate vast sums of money to defend itself. Jinteki is a bit more... overt in the way that they handle Runners; rather than misdirect or stop the Runners, Jinteki looks to wipe them off the face of the planet by administering ample damage as the consequences for prying into their work. Finally, NBN (my favorite) is the Corp that controls what the public sees in the Netrunner universe; their focus on tracking and manipulating the news of the world is echoed in the way that they keep tabs on the Runner by applying tags and punishing them for their runs later.<br /><br />THINGS I FEEL I AM OBLIGATED TO SHARE<br />This product is often referred to by players as the \\"Core Set\\". It contains all of the cards necessary to play both Corp and Runner in the original incarnation of the game, which makes it perfect for those who would like to learn the game and share the fun with others. Netrunner is classified as a Living Card Game (LCG) by Fantasy Flight Games, which means there's no need to go out and purchase boxes of booster packs in the same way that you might be forced to do in Collectible Card Games (CCG; Magic: The Gathering, for example); all of the cards that have been created for this set are in this box (sort of... more on that in a sec).<br /><br />As an LCG, additional cards are added to the game once every month or so in groups of 20 and multiples of 3 (the maximum number that you can have in your deck for each card). These are called Data Packs and serve to expand on the total card pool and give new opportunities to each side to broaden or focus their strategies for their particular decks. As an avid fan of this game, I find this to be an exceedingly appealing way to handle card games. There is no need to hunt forrare cards or to go out of your way to trade with others to find the cards you're looking for. That being said, the Core Set does not contain multiples of 3 for each card. This is frustrating because there are several cards in the Core Set that you very much want to have \\"3 of\\" in your decks because the synergies are so great. If you end up playing this competetively like I do, you're almost certainly going to want to buy a second Core Set, there is virtually no way around this and that is a total bummer.<br /><br />VERDICT<br />I think you should buy and play this game. Fans of the cyberpunk genre will love the dynamic conflict in every game between the powers-that-be and the small cadre of those that want to stop them. Those that are into competetive card games are going to love the numerous strategies that each player can implement throughout a game and the planning and finesse required to execute them. I'm going to be honest: the rules will be complicated the first few times you play. Not to worry, keep a copy of the rulebook around to answer any questions and things will start to fall into place.<br /><br />I think there might be one reason, fundamental to the game and its mechanics, as to why some might not enjoy this game as much as I do: this game takes the me-vs-you elemnt of games and enhances it greatly. In other games, I feel like you are simply a proxy for the imaginary players of the game, trying to win before the other player does. In Netrunner, you do not simply earn points faster, you either steal them or take them and deny the same to the other player. For the player ahead, it can be rewarding; but for the other, it somestimes feels as though you go into desparation mode, as if the winner is taking something away from you (and they are, technically). I find this invigorating as a competetive player, but I can see how others might be turned off by that element. That said, it still doesn't change my recommendation to anyone reading this review:<br /><br />BUY AND PLAY THIS GAME.

B002RI9MWA|3.0|I liked the way it was written...but the abruptness of the ending was a little difficult to digest...I can understand the intent of the author to leave the ending up to the imagination of the reader..but it was difficult to think of how it would end as there was hardly any indication of what the other person was like..only some mention of some expressions and offences that he might wave taken as the story was narrated..<br />But I will also say that this is entirely my opinion and is no indication of how the book may unfold to other readers
B00CL0J99K|5.0|It has been eight long years since Shane Black unleashed his hilarious little crime comedy known as \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" into theaters. Black was a surprising replacement for Jon Favreau as director of \\"Iron Man 3.\\" Not because Black wasn't up to the task, but a big blockbuster film like \\"Iron Man 3\\" was just a fascinating way to follow up Black's directorial debut. There's a lot for \\"Iron Man 3\\" to cover; how the events in The Avengers have affected Tony Stark (the returning Robert Downey Jr), the new terrorist villain The Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley), Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) dropping the War Machine for Iron Patriot, and witnessing what Tony's new Mark XLII armor can really do. Then there's the undying question on whether or not a third film in a franchise is any good or not. Will it be better than the last sequel? Can it live up to the first film? Shane Black throws even more sharp wit, laugh out loud humor, ingenious ideas, and even a few unexpected twists and turns into an already well established and beloved superhero franchise.<br /><br />The events of Los Angeles have been affecting Tony Stark more than he lets on. He's been up for three days straight and spends night and day expanding his armory. In 1999, Tony snubbed a nerdy and somewhat handicapped scientist named Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who wants Tony's assistance and support for Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM). In the present day, Aldrich is a brand new man and AIM has developed the Extremis program, which allows users to heal from extreme injuries. But if the host rejects Extremis, their body gets massively hot and they detonate like an unstable explosive. At the same time, a terrorist mastermind known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has taken over the airwaves and claims that he will kill the President of the United States. As Tony struggles with unpredictable anxiety attacks and keeping Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) safe, he realizes he can no longer stand by and do nothing when security chief Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is caught in the blast of a terrorist attack.<br /><br />If you're a fan of \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,\\" then the opening narration will immediately bring you back to that film. Shane Black has also written the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" films, \\"The Monster Squad,\\" and \\"Last Action Hero.\\" That buddy cop dynamic really has a chance to shine in \\"Iron Man 3\\" during the last half hour or so. So not only is it full of action, but the humor and amusing conversation is amplified.<br /><br />The film doesn't shy away from using the advanced technology you've come to expect from these films. Tony rebuilds Happy's crime scene with the technology at Stark Industries, but Aldrich utilizes three small ball bearings that project things like the inside of his brain which is seemingly accessible anywhere and anytime. There are several references to \\"The Avengers\\" and even one to \\"Thor.\\" Stick around for the after-credits scene for another little gem.<br /><br />The really big action sequences seem to be even bigger this time around. Tony's mansion being demolished is extraordinary, especially when the film switches to a first person perspective and you see something like Tony Stark in the Mark XLII suit being trapped underwater by falling debris. It's intense. The Air Force One sequence is also just incredible. How Tony saves that many people is pretty creative. There was news floating around that Joss Whedon was so impressed with the ending to \\"Iron Man 3\\" that he has no idea how to top it for \\"The Avengers 2.\\" The finale features some of the most visually impressive and structurally satisfying action sequences to be featured in any superhero film to date.<br /><br />It would feel criminal not to mention Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce in this review. Kingsley is fantastic. The Mandarin role is a complex one, but Kingsley puts this fantastic spin on the character that comic book fans will either find extremely gratifying or completely blasphemous. Pearce isn't quite as despicable or scene demanding as he was in \\"Lawless,\\" but he proves once again that he knows how to portray a memorable antagonist.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man 3\\" is nearly as good if not completely on par with the original \\"Iron Man.\\" It's innovative, hilarious, and crafted in the same vein of the first film. The closing act is so ridiculously good and gratifying that it'll give you goosebumps. Robert Downey Jr electrifies in the Tony Stark role yet again. Now that Shane Black has proven that he's more than capable of delivering yet another funny, witty, and extremely enjoyable film, can somebody please get this guy to direct more than one film every eight years?uite as despicable or scene demanding as he was in \\"Lawless,\\" but he proves once again that he knows how to portray a memorable antagonist.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man 3\\" is nearly as good if not completely on par with the original \\"Iron Man.\\" It's innovative, hilarious, and crafted in the same vein of the first film.

B005AKFXZW|4.0|Fantasy is not a favourite genre, yet the story bridges the circus world of the 19th and 20th century with the world of &#34;magic&#34;. Lovely descriptive writing of the experience of the night circus and a story of a challenge within.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|this is a good book. It kept my interest until the very end! Kate Morton's style of writing is very comforatable
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is awesome.<br /><br />I can't wait for season 4.  I'll be looking for where to watch it in the fall when it comes out because I don't have television service.<br />I'll buy it from another vendor like Amazon, or whoever has it.  It's worth it.<br />better than most movies
B00574Q7PQ|5.0|The story plot of this movie is romantic and action packed. The twist in the end of the movie caught me off guard. It's definitely a movei worth seeing.
B003DNN0L2|3.0|It's an interesting story, and done in a very interesting way--it's really going to be an individual decision. I liked, it, but wasn't stunned. My wife loved it. It's based on a Roald Dahl story, so it has that going for it, if nothing else. (If you haven't read Dahl, his work includes Willy Wonka, James and the Giant Peach, to give you some idea).
B005SAYRA6|5.0|This movies is awesome. I would highly recommend this movie who loves action and cars. I can't wait for their next movie to come out in May.
1439199388|5.0|I've struggled with allergies and migraines for years and have done all sorts of nutritional research.  I came across this book and was absolutely amazed at some of the theories discussed.  This book is a fantastic compilation of science discoveries regarding how our immune systems interacts with infection, or lack of.  It certainly destroys many standard theories about cleanliness and good hygiene!<br /><br />It is a slower read with lots of medical knowledge, but absolutely worth the time. Each chapter covered amazing new unconventional ways to combat MS, autism, arthritis, allergies, asthma, lupus, you name it. If I was diagnosed with a serious autoimmune disease, I would certainly try some of the treatments in this book.<br /><br />For anyone also looking at this book vs a similar book called The Autoimmune Epidemic, the other book is good but focuses mostly on pollution and chemicals impacting our health and is a good argument that has been around for a while.  This book focuses mostly on new discoveries about human interaction with parasites, viruses and bacteria.  Each have their place and have good points.  This book just seems to introduce more solutions, not just problems.
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|I am a fan of Russell Crowe and find his work very believable. The only thing I find wrong with this film is he isn't in it long enough.
0307346617|5.0|Amazing book and looking forward to the movie. Hopefully the upcoming movie will be as great as the book is.
B000W745CU|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Harry Potter movies. Daniel Radcliffe was the best pick for the hero and the two who played his friends.
0345529057|5.0|Sadly I'm not hipster enough to say I read the books before the show became a hit but if you have seen the show you will also greatly enjoy the books. They go into way more detail than the show and give you a better insight of the world and its rich history.
B000W799NU|5.0|I find this film quite interesting. What a place to find under Hogwarts. I don't know if I could have stayed at school if there had been a place like that under mine! Scary!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Why doesn't this come pre-installed on the Kindle Fire (1st generation)? As a basic essential app I think it should. Anyway, it's Google, with all the pros & cons we've all come to expect from it. I use it constantly so I consider it a necessity.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is so cute and fun. You do not have to be a kid to enjoy this game. Who doesn't like Nemo anyway.  Right?
B007N8RULO|2.0|I am legally blind & have a hard time with the size of the cards & symbols on the ones displayed in this game. I'm sure it's a fine app but you'll have to take the word of other reviewers that are better equipped for the job. It should have a resizing capability like so many other games & apps do.
B002UAJ0BS|5.0|This is a must own for any music fan. Truly one of the most important and influential albums of all time. Sounds even better on vinyl.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I consider this one of the basic essentials for all devices, at least for someone like me who has weird musings throughout the day & then just HAS to look them up lol! A necessity that I think should be pre-installed on the Kindle Fire.
0800141628|5.0|This is truly a great movie and I would recommend this to anyone who collects movies to add it to their collection.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I really enjoyed it.  It was different but not.  Looking forward to the next book in the series.  Can't wait!
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Squirted this stuff on the fan heat sink per laptop service manual. It's been a few weeks and the new cooling fan still works... and the CPU hasn't self-combusted.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|a very good movie the bluray is excellent all the actors in this movie are very good the special afects are excellent you will enjoy this movie.
B007ZYABW6|5.0|Reading the book on the suggestion from my older cousin.  I am 66.<br />Incredible story, true life experience of a Polish soldier who was captured by the Russian army and put in their gulag system.  It is the story of his escape with a group of prisoners who gave it their all to get away from the Soviet Union prisoner of war camps during WWII.  What is so ironic is the escapees were also fighting the Nazis.  The Russian's were so suspicious that they imprisoned anyone who was not Russian.<br /><br />Worth the cost to read.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This is a MUST hear cd. Its GREAT!! The lyrics are what most all people can relate to. Has all the Joe guitar, it's GREAT.!  The DVD is a BIG bonus.!  All cd's should come out with a short DVD like this ! It's makes the listener feel like he's part of the project.  GREAT JOB, JOE !  ROCK ON ........ David C.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this show. Sometimes we have to watch it on Amazon when we miss it on TV, but it works great! Super easy and loads just fine.
B008SVS3FC|3.0|This cd is a good cd, its just a little slower. The lyrics are typical great John Hiatt . This is a &#34;sit back & listen&#34; cd
B008BRC6NS|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's of her's.  All the songs make you want to dance and they are awesome!

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Stronger is a good name for this CD because it is one of her Strongest CD's yet!  Everyone that likes Kelly Clarkson will LOVE this CD.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The book starts with good writing and develops the characters well but at the end becomes a little predictable and slow paced. Overall a good read.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|the New Battery does NOT hold a charge!!!!! Runs good for about 5 minutes then just dies.  I have owned one of these for about 4 years and I have just worn it out, so I purchased this one and it runs down very quickly.  The old one was awesome !!!!!! Contacted Amazon cust. service, they solved the problem.  Company sending out a whole new unit with no return!!!!  That's service !!  Do not be afraid to purchase from this Company
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Firstly, as a Paramore fan since the beginning, every album has been slightly better than the last. In this case, I would say not only is it Paramore's best album by a long shot, it's a darn fine album for ANY artist to be proud of. The adult woman in me REALLY appreciates Haley's matured voice in these tracks, while the angsty teen leftovers of me still enjoy the more old school feel Paramore songs like \\"Be Alone\\", \\"Anklebiters\\" and \\"Still Into You\\".<br /><br />I'm always wary of albums with interludes, but actually I LOVE all three on this album, and wish they were full songs! They remind me a bit of Ingrid Michaelson, and I'm glad she was able to open up lyrically and not be afraid of sounding anti-Christian. Maybe it was best for the Farro brothers to go.<br /><br />The album closer, \\"Future\\" is very lovely and progressive, like a rock lullaby. If I were to just hear the guitar/drum work at the end of it randomly, I would never know this was Paramore. It reminds me of Deftones, Tool, etc, and it's very cool.<br /><br />One of the best tracks for me was \\"(One Of Those) Crazy Girls\\", because it's a great example of a creepy but upbeat song. It actually reminds me a lot of Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill album closer/hidden track \\"Your House\\" & has a dreamy sound towards the end. \\"Part II\\" is like a mix of Sia's style, and Freur's \\"Doot Doot\\". I think it might be Haley's best vocal moment ever at the songs ending. \\"Last Hope\\" is more of a background song, and is similar to something the band Fun would do. While I didn't much care for \\"Daydreaming\\", \\"Last Hope\\" & \\"Proof\\", I don't mind sitting through them as they flow through the album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks I think stand out the most (and are the most fun/singable) are \\"Fast In My Car\\", \\"Now\\", \\"Grow Up\\", and the best ballad they've ever done, \\"Hate To See Your Heartbreak\\". I can just picture this song in a movie or tv show scene, or a music video with slowed-down tour moments. For someone who can't stand country, I think it uses the proper elements of it, and makes it better. It actually reminds me a little of the band Eisley.<br /><br />All in all, this is my new favorite album to listen to, Haley sounds the best she ever has, and  everything the band has done up to this point was meant to make an album like this. I'm glad they ventured out and proved they could keep getting better.tand country, I think it uses the proper elements of it, and makes it better.

0316056898|4.0|Following the life of the highly-recognized Tina Fey, who started as an awkward teen and grew into a juggling parent, is not only entertaining, but will leave you laughing out loud. Her memoir revisited components of her life from playing Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live to her chaotic honeymoon. She didn't venture far from her quirky self, even when surrounded in her workplace, which created endless laughter and engaging conversation. There were several references to famous people that may be foreign to some, however adds the extra spark to all of her jokes. Some may argue Fey's memoir lacked a significant conflict, but each chapter unraveled a captivating story, embedded with noteworthy advice. Tina Fey composed a well-written memoir, rich of both relatable situations and striking accomplishments.

0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day by Mark Owen is a heart wrenching story. Starting with his first deployment in Afghanistan and culminating with the killing Osama Bin Laden. I would highly recommend anyone to read this book who is interested in our government. It uses  first hand experiences of a Navy Seal and strong diction to make you feel like you're fighting in the battles as well. He was first deployed to Afghanistan with Seal Team Five where he learned the necessary traits, discipline and commitment required to be an elite Navy Officer. He was based out of Virginia with his Seal team Five. But through Mark's over achieving and hard work he was asked to try out for the \\"Green Team\\". Only the Green Team gets the opportunity to try out for Seal Team Six, \\"the most prestigious SEAL team\\". I won't spoil any details but for his whole training experience and missions, this is a must read book. He pulls you in with his honesty and his determination. It was a book i couldn't set down. Mark keeps you on edge at all times making you wonder what will happen next or is everyone okay? Although i would highly recommend this book the only downfall is his assumption that everyone knows military slang terms. This made the story hard to follow at times. Otherwise, it is very successful because of his use of first hand experiences.  Mark proved to be very intelligent and gave a real sense of reality by giving both the positives and the negatives that occurred during his experience.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Love the music and the length of the songs. Not normally into buying JT music but this was worth it. Good Job JT
B002V091IO|5.0|Emma irritated me badly as I wanted to shake her so many times and say get a life and stop being a doormat, he's never going to be interested in you long term.<br />Dex's bad behaviour towards Emma and the fact he took their friendship and her good nature so much for granted was written in a way that it was to be expected of him and of course be excused.<br />In saying that, i'm giving this book five stars as it made me feel  anger, annoyance, teary, and sad.  It had laugh out loud moments as Emma is written so real.. Not many women I know can say they never felt stupid or inadequate around the coolest, handsomest guy they knew and did something silly.<br />One way to tell if a book has really captured you is if you are thinking about the characters or the plot whilst you are in between reading sittings.  If you are, then its affected you and you just HAVE to finish it to know what's going to happen next.  This book did that to me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|A good basic game, easy to play.<br />Don't like the &#34;Ads&#34; each time I start a game but they are the price of admission!

B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|DS9 Has been overshadowed by it's more popular Star Trek siblings. But, with its arcing plot-lines and deep introspective stories, it is easily the best of all the Star Trek shows, if not the best sci-fi show ever created. If you have never watched it, without a doubt, you should.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|This was a novel that I found hard to put down while I was reading it, but when I finished I somehow felt rather empty, rather than my usual energetic self.  The writing is engrossing, but in many ways it is like watching an episode of the Bachelor - a sort of guilty pleasure while you're reading it, but it doesn't have a lot of staying power in the end.<br /><br />If you enjoy young adult literature and dystopias at that, you might think about this.  If you love watching the Bachelor and like the other two things I mentioned, then this book is for you.  Beware that it does end on a sort of cliffhanger, so you'll want to watch out for the next novel.

0767821769|4.0|It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now: it is as fresh  and refreshing as the year it was made. Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.<br /><br />Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.<br /><br />The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show.  But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family.  It remains a very fine movie. Grady Harp, May 13
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is TV drama at its best. The writing and acting are superb and gives wonderful insights into the households of early 20th Century English gentry.
0670026557|5.0|I heard Professor Grant speak and also read his book. Instantly changed how I think. I catch myself thinking: how could I ask for a match? instead of always giving. It's a simple but crucial insight for me and a lot of givers.

B009ZQC7MY|2.0|I subscribe to a video streaming service which lost out to Amazon for the rights to stream Downton Abbey. I love the show, so if it was possible to review only the content, I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />As background, I did not enjoy watching Season Two of Downton Abbey on Amazon even though as a Prime customer the streaming was free. The Amazon streaming experience is terrible, starting with how difficult it is to even find the video stream. Of course, some of you may be smarter than I am, but I find it appalling that Amazon doesn't/can't keep track of where we were in the series, and that I have to remember the episode which is always NOT the episode Amazon suggests we are watching.<br /><br />Then, we came back for the third season, and I had to pay $2.99 per episode to watch it after just having watched, for free -- well, not free, for the cost of Prime -- the final episode of Season Two. This was rather a shock. Amazon got their money from me as I had promised the next episode to my children and I didn't feel it would be fair to withhold it just because Amazon figured out how to snooker me.<br /><br />I am generally a very happy Prime customer, and have been part of the Prime program since the very beginning. This is my first negative review of Amazon and its service. I think they made a very bad choice regarding how to make money off of Downton Abbey.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I heard about Alt-J through All Music Considered and I was hooked right away. So many bands and solo acts attempt the blend of sound and genre that Alt-J achieves here so nicely on An Awesome Wave.  The two standout songs in my opinion are Tessellate and Fitzpleasure but frankly calling out a few tunes might do some disservice to the overall experience.  I highly recommend listening to this album in a setting where you can enjoy the rich sound.  My first listen was in the car and I missed out on a lot of the quieter pieces.  Find a quiet place, relax, and enjoy.
1576875776|5.0|Bought it as inspiration and also because I used to shoot with Rolleiflex cameras. Great book and look into a bygone era. Chicago looks cool.
B000286RKW|5.0|great gift! The recipient of this gift and I were able to view this film and enjoy the special features....
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I often VPN into work and have several network interfaces. Jump Desktop had no issues connecting locally or remotely to this win7 machine which gave Splashtop2 some trouble. Used it for several days now and works flawlessly with great performance.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Really fun, great graphics and an interesting story line. This is my fifth or sixth game for g5 and they never disappoint.
B0070DOHQS|2.0|Great concept didn't work for me.  Too many errors. I tried all the tech support and all the steps to verify I had all the correct data ...yet it still fails.
1781164150|3.0|I bought this book along with the other \\"art of\\" books of HTTYD, Finding Nemo, The Croods and Kung Fu panda 2, and this book was easily my least favourite. A couple of the concept art of Mavis by Annette Marnat were pixelated on the edges, something I didn't expect from an \\"art of\\" book.<br /><br />It's not a bad book, I just didn't find it that impressive. For a chunk of the book being dedicated to character design, I would have liked to see more concept art leading to each of the characters final designs. The only ones that had that were the pages of Mavis and Eunice.  At least the cover is nice.
B00CAJDUX8|5.0|There are fan wars raging all over the blogosphere. Musicians, cell phone companies, box stores, automobile manufactures, political action committees, sneaker brands, etc, all have legions of fans whose sole purpose, it seems, is to ruin their competition and vice versa. It appears childish in nature, but because companies, musicians, and politicians have taken such a laisser faire approach to curtailing it, these people have become more and more embolden.<br /><br />Amazon, just a humble warning, you are ignoring this trend to your own peril.<br /><br />Having said all that, I am aware anonymous speech is protected by the 1st Amendment and therefore a legal conundrum.
B0054XOMX4|4.0|Seems to be a great beyblade my only complaint is that it didn't come put together.  That wouldn't be an issue except the directions aren't in english and once we finally got it together (through a lot of trial and error), it keeps falling apart.  Clearly we are doing something wrong or not getting it tight enough.  It works for several spins then falls apart.  Now after only a few days of use we are missing a piece that went flying when it fell apart.  If we are lucky we will find it before the vacuum (or dog) does.  Otherwise, this was a huge waste of money.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I enjoyed the CD, but his duet singing with Willie Nelson, CRAZY stinks.  Willie Nelson is basically off key the entire time he sings.  Paul Anka should reconsider ever doing another song with him.  I think it's time for Mr. Nelson to hang up his singing voice which seems to be off key and wobbles.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The book was a long time in coming, but was worth the wait. The ending was a little unpredictable, which was good. I recommend this series of books to anyone.
0385349831|4.0|Manuscript Found in Accra is the perfect book for anyone looking for direction in their life. If you've read the summary you know that this book is about a man, Copt, who is addressing townspeople who are under the threat of invasion looking for wisdom for their problems. He addresses issues such as defeat, solitude, fear, beauty, and so much more. This book reads much like a parable from the Bible. Coelho has written a book that will appeal to all ages, from young to old, you can take away a message  from this book. Although I can't help but think this would be a great gift for kids graduating from high school or college. I think fans of Coelho's others books such as, The Alchemist will enjoy his latest book.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I wanted to read book prior to seeing the movie and im glad i did . great read  and short chapters so greet to read prior to bed!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Another Jack Reacher thriller.  Grasps you right up front and keeps you wondering about what is coming up next.  Great read.
B000002KDO|5.0|With this release Black Sabbath seemed to take a darker approach, than the previous album.  Not that Paranoid was all sunshine and lollypops either.  This album just sounds gloomier than most if not all their other releases, and amongst the Ozzy era Sabbath albums, 13 still to be released, this is my favorite sounding album of theirs.  Everything seemed to just fit perfectly on here.<br /><br />Sweet Leaf 9/10 everybody's favorite ode to the sweet leaf, was a Black Sabbath staple, and I'd suppose is again since they've reunited.  In case you haven't heard it, it's an upper mid tempo ricker with a catchy riff.<br /><br />After Forever 8/10 is a more up tempo song with some more mid tempo parts.  Ozzy singing what sounds like almost Christian lyrics is pretty interesting.  Overall I like this one a lot.<br /><br />Children Of The Grave 10/10 is one of my favorite Black Sabbath songs of all time.  This one has a really catchy riff, and is fairly fast paced, for them.  I love the beat, and everyone is in top form on this track.  Love the melody as well.  Another Sabbath classic.<br /><br />Lord Of This World 7/10 is a slow and doomy song, but it's fairly solid.  I'm normally not a fan of super slow songs but the ones on here are pretty good.<br /><br />Solitude 8/10 wow.  Black Sabbath doing a ballad, I think their first.  I'm assuming that's Ozzy on vocals and if so wow I didn't know he could sound like that.  Thisis a very quiet song with clean guitars and soft vocals.  It never does anything fancy and really doesn't need to.  It definitely adds some variety to the Black Sabbath catalog.<br /><br />Into The Void 7/10 ranges from mid tempo to slow and doomy, very sabbath like, which makes sense because this is after all Black Sabbath.  There's also a faster part to change things up, which is nice.<br /><br />I could probably have gone into greater detail, but i'm sure that's been done on other reviews.  If you're looking for one of the truly inspirational albums in hard rock and heavy metal music this is definitely one of them, and for good reason.
B004IJEVYU|2.0|The format wasn't usable for this area, but I got credit for it without hassle, so that was good. I do like the music and that was really what I was looking for, rather than the movie. Again, the seller was great about it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is fantastically written. It's kind of setup interestingly. But, I'll let you find that out. I found the religion dynamic of Pi to be fascinating and clever. I still need to see the movie, I hope it lives up to this book. :D
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We are 4 episodes in and love it so far.  I'm not too into the genre, but the suspense, action, makeup, sets, and actors are awesome.
B009IRS756|5.0|This reminds you that just because it's old it's not always a 'classic'.  These are mostly 'one hit wonders' but what a great mix of bands trying out 'new' guitar effects and covering the sounds and style of famous people like the Beatles and Dylan but with their own songs.  I was in high school during the First Psychedelic Era and this is pretty upbeat, happy, stoned music that was more 'alternative' or 'underground' style and not the Boss Sound mix of so many AM pop stations - you heard these from college radio stations a lot.  Yeah there's some duds, but a whole lot more 'hits'.  Get it and enjoy.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Headset is great. Feels like I'm actually inside the game with the surround sound. The extra G buttons makes it easy to listen to music and changing songs without having to minimize my game.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Great show, great season! I didn't watch Castle from the beginning so when I saw the preview for Monday's show with scenes clips from past shows I thought I would check them out. It was great! The quality was fantastic. It was easy to figure out. It could have cost a little less but it was still good.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence absolutely deserves the Oscar for her performance. I can't believe that a 22 year old woman has this kind of power and depth. Bradley Cooper was totally captivating with his portrayal of a bipolar man lost in his own reality. De Niro came alive with his best performance in years. The rest of the cast was magnificent. Every once in while a movie is made that can be considered a truly delightful piece of art. This film was one of those few where that can be said. A must see experience that was much better than I expected. It is worth seeing multiple times.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Night Circus was just what I needed after a long, cold winter of reading murder mysteries. It had elements of good and evil, magic, and true love.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|As usual I'm waiting for the next episode with anticipation. The cast is still interesting and story lines... I will be getting the next season (6th).
B009YU62H2|4.0|In a world of great and not so great bands....one group of guys stand alone....the true alpha males of the pack  who create music for other true alpha males in a world of wanna be's fake tough guy image-ness,, whatever...Soundgarden have the grit and drive  ...but they also are highly intelligent species..very... Kim once called them \\"thinking man's metal\\".. And this sets the stage and tone throughout King Animal... I have only had the disc a short while, so a play by play hasnt formed yet, but i can tell you this is Soundgarden!!  It is not, Down On The Upside, no one, not even these guys will ever record something as great as that record again,  King Animal is great in its own right..What is really obvious here is how much the guys have learned the past decade+ while going different routes...and once they come back together is where the real magic takes place...Don't think twice, if you're reading this , you should buy it and form your own review.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love it!!! I like Mario Brothers and this is just as great. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys Mario Brothers..:)

B00A1OZBSQ|5.0|I have always thought my eating habits were, if not great, not really terrible either. I don't drink pop, I rarely eat red meat, and I don't add much salt to my food. Turns out I've been wrong. The yogurt I eat has just as much sugar as the ice cream it was meant to replace; I replaced red meat with cheese, one of the worst offenders in the junk food catalogue, according to author, Michael Moss; and not adding salt to my food, in many cases, only means I'm not adding insult to the injury of the already salt-laden processed foods I eat. Turns out what I thought was a relatively good diet was a lie, much of it fostered by the processed food industry, a kind of smoke-and-mirrors magic show but the amazing illusions it has created can kill us. Stephen King couldn't have written a better horror story.<br /><br />In Salt, Sugar, Fat, Moss talks about his three year journey through the processed food industry and what he found was truly frightening. The three ingredients in the title are the pillars of the industry and to say the industry uses them liberally is like saying hockey can be a little violent at times. The amount of these ingredients used is shocking and has led to the epidemic of obesity, Type-2 diabetes, and other health concerns which are taxing our health and the health care industry.<br /><br />Nor is the industry unaware of the problems it is creating. Moss spent a great deal of time talking to the scientists who are responsible for the creation of many of the worst offenders, many of whom have at least tried to make healthier changes. But, as Moss points out, this is an industry more beholden to its shareholders than its consumers. If they can't show profits, Wall Street will want to know why and it won't take 'health crisis' for an answer.<br /><br />And the industry does its best to comply. Children's shows are inundated with commercials pushing cereals with enough sugar to take down an elephant; guilt-ridden working moms are told that fat-laden lunchables are a healthy and fun way to make the kids happy; and who doesn't like cheese on their easily prepared frozen pizza, lots and lots of cheese, something the whole family can enjoy. And the industry keeps the price low so that these processed foods are cheaper than healthy foods and they make sure they are placed at eye-level in supermarkets while real healthy choices like fruits and vegetables are pushed to the side. Poor neighbourhoods, where there are no supermarkets, are an especial target. And even reading labels isn't always the answer since sugar, salt, and fat can come in different varieties, with different names. Unless you recognize all these names among the dozens of ingredients listed, you are not likely to realize the real amount of each within, say, that granola bar the commercials tell you is a great healthy substitute for fruit at breakfast.<br /><br />So what can the consumer do? As Moss points out, very little. The FDA tends to be more of an aid to the industry rather than a watchdog for the consumer and we all saw what happened when Michael Bloomberg tried to outlaw huge soda cups in New York. The backlash was heard throughout the nation - how dare he curtail our freedom to kill ourselves with sugar - and his well-intentioned law was quickly struck down. The consumer, according to Moss, has only one choice - take responsibility for what you put into your body and that of your children. Changing your eating habits won't be easy. Processed foods is one of the hardest addictions to break (and it is an addiction) but it can be done. Reading this book is a great place to start.
B001LM1456|3.0|The more CGI in a movie, the more I tend to disdain it.  This movie is no exception.  Let's face it, you're watching a cartoon when you watch CGI.  And the CGI in TIH is hit-and-miss.  The premise is fairly straightforward -- Bruce Banner strives to elude authorities while searching for a cure to his condition.  It's the same theme used in the TV series of the same name starring Bill Bixby.  I didn't think Norton and Tyler were as good in roles of Banner and Betty Ross as Bana and Connelly -- and Sam Elliot was definitely superior to William Hurt as General Ross.  And then there's Tim Roth.  I enjoyed him as Thade in Tim Burton's revisioning of Planet of the Apes, but his performance and appearance in this movie really annoyed me.  As a former member of the military, it grates on me when the military is portrayed in an unrealistic manner.  Roth walking around in a military dress uniform, him unshaven and his hair hanging over his ears?  I don't think so -- not to mention his constant swagger when he walked leading me to wonder if he wasn't a bit drunk.  His performance crosses the line between tough-guy and buffoon (or at least camp).<br /><br />The action was enjoyable, if a bit over the top.  The aforementioned storyline was only adequately conveyed.  It's likely we won't be seeing any more Hulk movies for a while.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|While it was nice seeing how some things came about as far as how they related to the first LotR movie (coming from someone who didnt read the books) it was hard to fall in love with the characters like the other movies. Did any of you notice during combat there was like NO orc blood on weapons when they were in battle? That really bothered me I know the series was not a slaughter fest with waves of green blood but come on I felt like I was watching a PG movie. The small little snip-its that tied into the LotR movies were the most enjoyable thing about this movie to me.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|Front row at Cynthia Woods Pavilion regarding the above date. My fifth time to see em and very impressed with set list and of course guitars rocked and drumming was incredible. My kids went with me and said it was the best show they had ever seen, I agree! Front row helped, lol! Will order this BluRay to relive this concert as it kicked ars! Halford hit the notes but seeing them a few times in the 80's, he has lost a few breaths but still rox!
0399224459|5.0|I love this kids book<br />I buy it as a gift for new parents who are friends because the book can grow with the child<br />There may not be a lot of words but that is the beauty and genius of it. As your child gets older the parent can add more and more embelishments to the story to keep the child (and parent) entertained for years
B008JFUO4U|5.0|At this point, I've seen this movie three times (twice in a \\"normal\\" theater and once in IMAX). That might give you a hint as to where I'm going with this.<br /><br />First a quick disclaimer: I loved Tron Legacy (also directed by Joseph Kosinksi who directs this film), partially because of nostalgia but more because I absolutely loved two aspects of the film which are present here as well: the beautiful visuals of the production's design and the epic soundtrack from Daft Punk. I wasn't too sure I'd love Oblivion but it looked cool (big Sci-Fi fan) and had a nice bit of mystery about what's really going on in the trailers.<br /><br />I will keep this spoiler-free as I think the events of the movie and where it goes are part of the fun.<br /><br />The basic plot summary is Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are part of a team that's left on Earth to help with \\"clean-up\\" after the Earth was devastated by an alien invasion. The world is barely recognizable and most of the survivors (save for Jack and Victoria) are either on Titan or on the space station orbiting the planet called the Tet. The pair work on watching over the drones that are guarding huge water collectors that are pulling Earth's oceans to take with the remaining humans to Titan. Jack is the technician who flies in a dragonfly-shaped ship running patrols and rescuing downed drones. The drones are there and are being downed by a remaining contingent of the alien invasion that are scattered about the planet. As the commercials said, we won the war but lost the planet. Victoria acts as Jack's controller, using telemetry to help Jack while relaying orders coming from the Tet's mission controller.<br /><br />The rest you'll have to find out by watching.<br /><br />The film itself, as I said, was beautiful. Everything from the landscapes to the architecture of the tower the duo reside in are just visually stunning. They filmed much of the outdoor scenes in Iceland with its large expansesof desolate arctic tundra and volcanic soil. The director, Joseph Kosinksi, has a background in architecture and it shows in the designs of the tower and vehicles.<br /><br />The story is based on a graphic novel that the director had written and was talking about after Tron Legacy's release. Another reason I love the film is tied to my love for William Gibson's novels. I'm a big fan of concise dialog. There isn't a lot of hand-holding here. And while the story makes sense if you're open to it the first time through, watching it a second time helps as you'll realize why a certain character was a bit distant and laughed awkwardly at a specific moment. Ignore people going on about the reality of the environment and such...it's a movie people. I won't go into those sorts of things here (though I'm happy to discuss in the comments where people can't see...just no rants please). Just know that there are a couple of twists on the way to the conclusion that turn things on its head.<br /><br />The music was composed by M85 with the help of Joseph Trapanese and it's a great electronic ride. I've got the album (off iTunes) and personally I like to remove the \\"incidental\\" pieces that were obviously specific to a scene (I guess they all are but some are just better off in a movie and not blaring from your speakers). Even so, there are a lot of good pieces (I love Waking Up and a couple others I won't mention since the names could give away something...) and even though I'm not typically a fan of vocals over some of these great pieces, the one track with vocals has been winning me over each time I hear it.<br /><br />As the director himself put it, he wanted to create an environment that was \\"desolate but beautiful\\" as a sort of 180 from Tron Legacy where everything was dark but colorful. I think he did a great job. I love the fact that he used giant screens projecting video his crew filmed at the top of Haleakala (volcano) in Maui surrounding the tower set so the clouds you see are real, not CGI. That plus the tower set was lit with the light from those projections so you really feel like they're living in a tower above the clouds.<br /><br />On the acting front, honestly, don't expect Oscar-winning performances. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying this isn't Schindler's List. Tom Cruise does a great job playing his character but I think it's more because the character fits him than because he's pulling a Daniel Day Lewis and transforming himself. The other characters play their roles well (hello Morgan Freeman) and Game of Thrones fans will get a small treat from a Lannister.<br /><br />That all said, please ignore the critics' reviews. I read through a bunch and they were all saying the same thing...that the movie wasn't original. That it didn't break new ground in anything and blah blah. It annoys me to no end when I read reviews by these people who do nothing but review movies (nice job!) and somehow expect every movie that comes out needs to be never-before-seen and every performance needs to be some sort of incredible experience that goes into history annals and gets taught at film school. The movie tells a story that's original even if elements are going to be similar to other stories (c'mon, science fiction has been around for generations we've covered most of it). The director does a great job of putting it all together and explaining the parts that need explaining.<br /><br />Unless you absolutely hate any of the actors (especially Tom Cruise since he's central to much of the story) or aren't really a fan of sci-fi (though I'd argue the science fiction aspects really don't matter beyond being tools to tell a fictional story), this should be an enjoyable watch. If you're unsure, feel free to rent it first because as with all things, there are many opinions and what I like may be what you hate.<br /><br />If you liked the style of Tron Legacy, are a fan of Tom Cruise in general, like sci-fi, or all of the above, definitely go for this movie. If not, rent it and decide. I think the marketing of the movie might have hurt it a bit (along with those critic reviews) since this is not that much of an action film. It's more thoughtful. Hopefully you'll enjoy it.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Great movie! Friendship, honesty and adventure. Life changing. It is amazing to see how these two characters who think their life's are finish found each other and build a strong friendship.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first played this game I was not in too it but three days later I was addicted to it. I think this game is totes fab, I would totally recommend this to anyone
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This last book was like a part 2 of the second book. I cannot wait for Hollywood to film the last two movies. In the meantime, I will have to watch Swedish version with captions. If you have not read the series, I would highly recommend it.
B000031EGV|5.0|Great Movie! Robin Williams is a favorate for my family. He is funny and this is a movie for the whole family.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Brandon Sanderson packed a LOT of action into this last book, it felt a bit rushed, but I'm sure Jordan would have made it into two or three books based off of his track record.<br /><br />If you're already at book eight or nine, you might as well finish the series, right?  The last three books by Sanderson really tie together a lot of details that Jordan seemed to just keep spinning out.  Although not as descriptive as Jordan's writing, it stays true to the material and has some of the best action sequences of the series.
B000W4WF02|4.0|Admittedly, Tarantino hit a bump in the perfect record with Death Proof. But even his weakest film is sheer cinematic brilliance.

B007SGM084|1.0|I do not understand the hype about this series. The writing is terrible, the relationship is emotionally abusive, and the main character is quite frustrating.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|Stories Don't End is a great followup to the first Dawes CD. Can't get enough of these songs. Looking forward to seeing them live.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Still addicted to the show. Season three does not disappoint! New characters, new reasons to love old characters, and all the drama avid fans crave.

B003EVFHYG|5.0|This is worth the money because of how cool it sounds. My husband loves soundtrack music and so this was perfect for him.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Peter Jackson's obsession with this fast frame rate makes The Hobbit DVD what it is today... a movie with 2012 effects, but a look and feel of a 1980s TV movie. The graphics are excellent but the people look like Avatars and the movie is nauseating and hard to watch. People said that Avatar gave them seizures. This movie will just make you motion sick. While the story is good and obviously there are many LOTR fans who would want to see this movie, you should watch it with caution.<br />You'll laugh, you'll love, you'll cry.
B004EPZ084|5.0|Very good! Enjoyed it verry much, hilarious! Could not stop laughing. One of my favorite comedies, and with a lot of well known, good actors.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Here's the story behind the scene When they were painting the bus the guys from India was painted by people from India and Tommy Ching was smoking hash with some of those people and the chick who wasn't' t in the movie much, she dated Cjeech while he was still married.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The author has a real problem.  How could she allow her character to be so dependent on a very sick male?  There is nothing more in this world that I respect more is that I respect myself, and she obviously doesn't respect herself.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|After the filler book #4 that simply updated lesser characters, Martin returns to the fast paced intrigue of book 3.<br />Plot twists and unexpected events make for an easy enjoyable read. Waiting for Book 6 later this year (?)
B0091VTISO|1.0|This was a terrible movie.  If you are a fan of the books, or of the Arnie films, just don't do it.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|Fast passed and entertaining. This film is a lithe dark for some younger viewers but for the most part a like able film.

B009EAALII|5.0|This video and music was great and enyoyable to listen to.  Chris Isaak represents all the artists for Sun Records in the best way with his versions of their music. I would recomment this music to anyone, great entertainment.
0440246024|5.0|John Grisham is at the top of his game. I just sit and wait for him to write his next novel.<br />In this one, you get to follow the storyline of Willie Traynor, newspaper editor, from his unfortunate beginnings to his final great success. The legal twists and turns we find him encounter along the way are mesmerizing. (I have two lawyers in my family.)  I love the way Grisham likes to throw in his real feelings about the law as it's too often practiced, as with David Zinc, an attorney who's just had enough, in The Litigators.  And finally, Grisham's being from Mississippi allows him to include in the novel his knowledge of the plight of the African-American people, as in my favorite, A Time To Kill.  In fact, I think these three points that we see in so many of his novels, are what draws me to him.  But in all of Grisham's novels, it's the constant suspense, the &#34;watch the sun come up&#34; mark of a superior story-teller.  (I always read in bed.)  There have been only two or three authors in my adult lifetime who have affected me this way.  Jeanette

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett's historical fiction works are marvelous and also educational in that so much of it is based upon true events and actual people, with his characters so skillfully woven into the tapestry.  There are lessons of history to be learned here for those who listen and pay attention to the underlying themes.<br /><br />I look forward to the third book to see what happens with the next group of descendents from the original Fall of Giants families.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Bought this game for my grandson, he loves playing it. I seem to enjoy it to. Easy and hard levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Granddaughter got me hooked on this so I had to get my husband hooked on it.

B003XRELGQ|2.0|Not offensively bad, just didn't work for me personally. I know Vonnegut is an icon, great writer etc etc. I just didn't care in the slightest about the characters; Infact, they annoyed me.<br />I guess I can see why some people love this book- I think it would even be quite good as a subject for study in school. Perhaps if you're new to the genre it could spark some interest. But I'm not and it didn't
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to this app!! Have found this to use, to try, to not try. Like looking at what other people like or pin.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|Two people who know each other a long time are unable to communicate their feelings.  As a result another woman steps in gets the man but everyone of their friends knows it isn't right. It really drags on and on and makes you want to shake the main characters and tell them what to do.  It ends as it must, but felt like it took too long to get there.

1878424319|5.0|There is much to digest here, but for those who like Meditation, and De-Stressing your Life, these four Lessons are clues to use in our lifetime to bring us peace within, and hopefully, to those around us.  What others say and do should not determine our Fate.  There are other ways to remove the hurt, mistrust, and bitterness within ourselves, and ways to fill us with happiness.  It takes practice, but this is definitely a Life-Changer!

B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I haven't been sufficiently impressed, or alternatively, disgusted, enough to write a movie review since submitting a commentary on the original \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\" movie to my elementary school literary magazine as a kindergartner in 1990.  Twenty-three years later, \\"Ted\\" changed all of that.  The movie sucked.  I now look at friends of mine who admit to \\"liking\\" the movie on social media, or had the balls to say as much to my face, and respect them less.  Their judgement, as far as I'm concerned, is irredeemable.
0064431789|5.0|This book is a classic and my students loved it. Max's adventures captivated the children as we read the book.

B007SUW24W|5.0|I love every song on this album. Start to finish, there are no fillers. I am seeing Ed in concert twice this year and bought the CD to hear all of his songs. It was worth every penny. Plus I got the free digital download.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Characters: Kvothe is our first person narrator (although in interludes the book moves to third person). He is a brilliant young man (child for much of the first third of the novel) who is trying to survive terrible circumstances. Despite his brilliance, his arrogance and youth often contrive to put him in peril. We know he survives; the story is in how he manages it. A wonderful cast of well-developed supporting characters surrounds him.<br /><br />World building: A rich, well thought out world. It is a fantasy world, but you will not find hordes of goblins or tall, fair elves with bows. The world has a late Medieval/early Renaissance European feel to it. The otherworldly creatures that do exist do not steal the story, but do add flavor to it. The author has created a balanced system of magic with solid mechanics that do not feel overpowered.<br /><br />Writing/Mechanics: Professional in every way. Beautifully written.<br /><br />Engagement/Willing suspension of disbelief: Not once was I pulled out of the story with thoughts of \\"no way, that couldn't happen\\". Instead, I was pulled in and thoroughly engrossed the entire way through. I freely admit to moments where I laughed out loud and others where I teared up.<br /><br />Impact: A wonderful fantasy novel. I immediately purchased The Wide Man's Fear, the second book in the series. I give The Name of the Wind my highest recommendation.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Other than that its very easy to use,works well and is a pretty standard Facebook app.Nothing impressive,For free its okay.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|It was better then I expected.  Very entertaining.  I would watch it over and over cause you might miss a few important things.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I really like this game. A lot of fun, especially with the older crowd but we had fun even with our 5 year old. Definitely an educational game on par with Monopoly and Rat Race/Cashflow.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I thought this series was delightful.  It gives you a look at what life was probably like in the past as only the British can do it.  It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you smile......all without nudity or profanity.  What more can you ask?  I hope they continue the series.

B003B02O3C|3.0|I am not a routine book critic by any means but I could not give John Grisham's The Rainmaker 4 or 5 stars. It is a solid read, from the beginning you want to root for Rudy Baylor, an average law student who is trying to make it without the comfort of a rich family and cushy job offers. I felt for Rudy from page 1 until 70% of the book. I mean jeez, he had a job before graduation, the firm screwed him over, and he's out of luck and decides to take responsibility for his future by doing the right thing. His character was believable as a young man who is just trying to make it. Your pulse beats faster when Rudy gives a wow performance in court, you feel sad for the Blacks, esp. Donny Ray; you laugh at the elderly characters, and shake your head at Ms. Birdie and her money greedy family.<br /><br />Now where does Grisham lose me? It is so annoying how he starts off with character developments and then drops them (similar to Roland in The Chamber). What happens to Ms. Birdie? What the in the world does Rudy have in common with Kelly? On one hand, looking at Rudy's character, he is a save the world, stick it to the bad guy character. The Blacks bad guy was the insurance company, Kelly's bad guy was her husband. But just like how Rudy, as a lawyer, can find other bad faith insurance cases, I believe he could find the damsel in distress Kelly anywhere. I felt like if she was just another girl in a solid relationship, he would not have chosen her, instead he would have found another Kelly. There was no real connection other than 'You're beautiful' and 'I'm handsome'. I can't help to think a few years down the road, after the children are older, Rudy would just cheat on her, or they would separate (okay thinking too far).<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the book, I read it during my lunch breaks and it is entertaining. Not Grisham's best but certainly not his worst.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Not much to say other than it is Angry Birds and it was free. I had the ad supported version. When this became free I grabbed it too.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I think it's not as good as 61 Hours or Gone Tomorrow. In fact I had some difficulty concentrating on it. The plot just didn't seem as intriguing  as the other two.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|I just use this for something to doodle with on my tablet. It fits the purpose good. Plenty of features.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Haven't read it yet but I've watched the movie twice so I know that this is a really good book
B005DOKM9M|3.0|I think this does an adequate job in protecting the Kindle Fire when it is not in use. I prefer a cover where the Kindle stays &#34;attached.&#34; I purchased one of those and like using it better.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|A 900 page battle scene! Sanderson brought his style into play in a satisfying completion to Jordans masterpiece. Worth the purchase price and the wait for the kindle port. Im sad it over though...
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Super quality for the money. Recommended for all ages. We can pick out Each instrument and EQ instruments easily with these headphones
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I have gotten really involved in this show; I think the characters are really well cast; glad I didn't live back then
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I like a lot of Seth Macfarlane stuff so I thought I'd give it a try.  I assumed that it was kind of a gimmick story line and that I would lose interest halfway through the movie which is exactly what happened.<br /><br />It was good for a few laughs and Mila Kunis is always a cuite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! This book was fantastic! I knew there was going to be a twist, but I didn't see this one coming! Very well put together.  This book made me cry that is for sure!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved it! The music was great and the acting was supurb! Everybody of all ages should watch it as they will enjoy it.
B00CL66FEQ|3.0|I'm not gonna waste much time giving a review, I watch a lot of movies, and I couldn't make myself sit all the way through this movie, most anything funny was in the trailer/preview for this movie, so watch the preview and save yourself some money.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|If you like this type of reading - you cannot put the book down!!  Great book again!!  If you like waiting to see what is going to happen at the final time David has done it again!!
B001BWQVSG|5.0|Brilliant performances.  Excellent recording quality.  I couldn't be more satisfied.<br /><br />Wow.  She has so much energy and strength and at the same time can gracefully convey nuance.<br /><br />Some of the pieces, I had heard many times before, but listening to her rendition, I felt<br />like I was hearing them for the first time.<br /><br />I'll be looking for the \\"Collection II\\".
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I cannot say enough about the books I have read by David Baldacci!!  He just knows how to maintain you interest and keeps mine from the beginning to the end of every book.  Soon you get to know the people in the stories, and you start liking them and rooting for the good guys to win.  Another Great Book!!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I buy lots of DVD box sets.  Some of them I watch just a couple episodes before I move on to something else.  But every once in a while, I'll come upon a set which is so massively entertaining that I end up setting aside all other watchables so as to concentrate all my watching on just that one.<br /><br />With Community, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  It had good reviews so I expected it would be somewhat watchable.<br /><br />In the end, I watched all of the episodes within a weeks time.  (i.e. I couldn't put it down.)  Gearing up every night after work to absorb another 3 or 4 segments.  It was addictive.  And memorably funny.  I especially love the Senior Chang character.  LOL.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|This is the start of a club devoted to justice in government.  And it is not hard to relate to what is going on today in a country that seems to have lost its way.  Our fore fathers based this country on Life, Liberty and pursuit of happiness.  They believed with hard work that anything was possible.  It gives a taste of what a corrupt government can hurt the country.  Very well written!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it!  Can't wait for the next season to start. Another box of tissues, will watch all 3 seasons before the start of season 4
B0010SEMP0|5.0|More twists and turns than a back country mountain road. Couldn't put it down. Cat is well drawn and makes you believe that there could be such creatures that are half vampire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I simply love this game. It challenges me to better by reflex and react quicker. By far  one of my favorite games!!!!
B005CAATXG|5.0|Fantastic album. Highs and lows of tempo, songs all sound different, but are very good. I would buy another of their albums off the strngth of this one.
B001AGNRYO|4.0|This review is for the vinyl LP.  The package and pressing are excellent.  Vinyl is pristinely quiet.<br /><br />BUT for the premium price, one would expect the lossless and mp3 download files that came with the box set.  Album has no inserts, posters, or extras of any kind.  However, if you want this album on vinyl, this is a lot easier to obtain than an original version.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|My first loves have done it again...  While at first I missed the heavily sexual lyrics that The Block offered, this new album has depth and layers that true Block Heads will appreciate. Everyone has their own ritual that they go through to savor anything new that the guys release,most by pressing play and  repeat for the next week until memorized. And every time you hear each song, you uncover something different. Whether its realizing Jon is singing a certain lyric or catching a word you missed before... The Remix is AWESOME. Fun and daring you to NOT dance. There are ballads to slow things down, but then they hit you with Crash, a song you'd almost certainly hear at a night out at the club. Bringing you back in close to swoon at a more mature harmonizing then they've ever captured before in Fighting Gravity, and back to more dance songs.... This album is a fun night out, a trip on a roller coaster ride, a stroll down memory lane for old school fans, but also a GREAT introduction to those who have never heard the guys before.
0385344228|5.0|Really find this book absorbing and edifying about attitudes, adolescents, relationships and the law.  Also, about changing attitudes and ways of adjusting (good and bad) about on-going and difficult situations.  Very effecting.  I like books written in the first person and this is told in the voice of Jacob's father, who is a lawyer who has been ostracised because of his adolescent son's accusal in a murder.
B005DOKL3E|2.0|I like this cover while my Kindle is inside of it...but was disappointed that I had to take the Kindle entirely out of the cover in order to use the device. The sleeve is stitched closed at the bottom, rather than opening like a book, and there is nothing holding the device in the cover once you open the zipper. So, you unzip, reach in (be sure you have a good grip on your Kindle) and remove the device. If you need to step away from your Kindle for a moment, you either set it down with no protection, carry it with you with no protection, or zip it back into the case.<br /><br />I'm sensitive to this, as I have seven dogs and a cat, and an unprotected electronic device is always in danger! Also, I got my Kindle primarily for traveling with, and don't like having it completely out of the case when I'm using it in an airport or other crowded place. While the Kindle is in the sleeve, it is very nicely protected; the case is nice looking and well padded.<br /><br />I also had a problem with the zipper; possibly because I used it so often, the zipper stopped working after about four months.<br />So, overall, only two stars.
1442359315|5.0|If I'm taking a long car trip alone, I always make sure I have a book on cd to listen to.  I thought this was wonderful.  Like the author, I had no real view of what happens after death but I loved this and formulated a very joyful view of after life.  I never had a fear of death before like many people do but now I think it will be very lovely and fascinating.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I have owned an SB 800 for a number of years and was tempted to go up to a 900 but decided to try the 700 first and I really like it so far... simple and easy to use especially as a 2nd remote flash (much simpler controls than the 800)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I do not give very many 5 star ratings, but this was one game I felt was worth getting such a high review!  I really enjoyed it.  It was challenging and complex, but yet fun and addictive.  The 3D images and graphics are quite well done.  The hint button is helpful as you try to navigate your way through this complex puzzle.  Definitely worth the $2.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It makes you \\"see\\" what is going on by the way it is written.  If you like adventure stories, this is the book for you.
B005D4YGXK|5.0|The shoe is great, however,it was too small. This is not uncommon for my husband foot size when only whole sizes are available. You have the 1/2 sizes in the smaller shoe size but not in the 12&13. He thinks the 13 will be too big.😞.<br />But as you can see we rated it highly on your questionnaire.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this and the daily missions are fun takes to long to unlock armies but meh it's a good distraction
B004G600A4|3.0|The movie plays but the middle of the disc has a few cracks on it. it didn't say that in the description.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|The Grandchildren all love it, from age 11 to 2 years old!!  It works great, I can't believe its free.
B008H6GHL0|4.0|It is a good movie,  product is in great condition, I recommended to all the resident evil fans out there.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|it was an intense movie. I would definitely recommend it to people who like to watch intense actions thrillers. Leo was great.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Pretty much held to the book, but I agree with some of the others that three movies might be over-kill and done just to line some people's pockets.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|This was a great book probably one of the best I have read in a long time! I think this is a BUTIFUL book.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|What a treat....the first!  I enjoyed having Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer,  and detective Bosch in the same story.  Two of<br />my favorite characters!  Connelly really knows his stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. U get to compete against ur friends and it is way easier than the temple runs
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|We had 4 generations in the living room from 4 to 81. Everyone giggled and enjoyed this movie. I highly recommend it.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|The 13th studio album from our guys from Basildon does not disappoint. There are nay-sayers out there who have not given the melodies, harmonies and throw back grooves a fair listen and likely judged too quickly.  Start  with Broken, then move to Welcome to My World and Sothe My Soul, before revisiting Heaven. This album matches the greatness of SGR, BC, & Violator. If only Playing the Angel had more songs and less instrumentals...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed it. Just enough challenge and required thinking to keep you hooked. Yes, like all the others, you have to pay to continue playing but this one is worth it.
1400067820|2.0|I watch a tv interview of the author, Taleb, on the Colbert Show discussing antifragility which is the subject of his new book. It was fascinating idea and could be translated to many aspects of our life. I bought the book to learn more. In spite of the very good thoughts he has in the book, it was a great disappointment.<br /><br />The author's writing is most convoluted expression of a good concept. He tends to be a humorous writer but fails miserably with his dry wit. He is a namedropper even when it absolutely adds nothing to the argument. Every page has several unnecessary and witless parenthetical statements. He tries to elaborate on some statements but only to make less comprehendible and confusing. Most of the time he discusses issues that people love to hate. Many of the words he uses are not even in the dictionary, which is a must-have in order to read the book.<br /><br />His contempt for academics is over whelming, like smallpox, I wonder why he therefore claims to be a professor. He believes that government should not fund researchers but tinkerers. But research is tinkering.  To him, theoretical research is meaningless. Bunk !! Consider for example, James Maxwell who only theoretically (on paper) showed that the basic electromagnetic equations were missing a simple term. He did not prove the point experimentally. Years later, Hertz did. This gave us the very huge field of communication. From radar, radio, television, garage remote controller, to cell phones and many others all depend on that theoretical term.<br /><br />If one plans to read this book, it would be sufficient to read the second half of every other chapter.  The last chapter can be all skipped. His glossary is much less  helpful than the book.<br /><br />Mr. Taleb purpose for writing the book is not to help us learn new concepts but to impress us with whom he had lunch, what kind of red wine he had and what kind of tea he sipped.<br /><br />He thinks most other people are dumb, and otherwritings are worthless. He is an over educated conceited pompous ass.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It reminds me of other games like temple run and it is quite amusing to fly around in a suit of armor and shooting up A.I.M. members and beating the crap out of a few of the most notorious Iron Man villains
B005LAIIJY|2.0|I so wanted to love it, and initially, it did not disappoint. The genius of Quentin Tarantino is a given for me, but I think he frequently gets lazy, and it seems that's what happened here. He starts off with a gripping story, which then slows down while the tension supposedly ramps up over extremely long talking/dinner scenes, only to erupt in a mind-numbing marathon of volcanic gore that goes on and on until there's no shock value, no interest, no concern...just boredom. And he tops it all off with a ridiculously cheesy ending. It's a shame Tarantino can't make a movie that's a little more concise, and that maintains the pace throughout...oh yeah, he did, in PULP FICTION. His best work ever, IMO. I wish this had been a BIT more like that.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I wanted to finish the trilogy and I did. An easy read that left me satisfied. If you start the trilogy, I recommend you finish it.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|My favorite is Home.  Gave this CD to my grand daughter.  She goes to sleep every night listening.  She won't let me try a different CD.  This one is perfect.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|its s so so so.so so.so so so so so so so so so so wonderful and it can talk to you and it will tell you when you need to charge your kindle
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Finally a compatible version for my G tablet I can't play from Facebook on my tablet but downloaded from app store & am good to go
B008133MDK|5.0|Great actors, great writing, great movie. Reminds of the Robert Downey Jr. films, just in current day and they are very intelligently fun movies.
0525478817|5.0|This book is nothing short of amazing! I love John Green and the way he uses words. The Fault In Our stars immediately became my favorite book. I've read it twice now and plan to read it so many more times. Your heart aches for the characters. You fall in love with them. I never ever wanted the book to end.
B00BT0ZS52|1.0|If you like boring Doomsday, Animal Killing, Cannibal eating High Impact Garbage with no  meaning other than some half baked circus psychic's view of life (who then takes your $20) Oh... what a waste of 3 hrs. Don't waste your time on this pathetic attempt of a poor writer's view of parallel reality, past lives and a sad version of Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and The Agent from The Matrix. If you liked the matrix, you will hate this. This movie amounts to nothing more than some novice rip off of Land of The Lost meets Forrest Gump meets Hannibal Lector on The draft set the Island. REALLY don't waste your time. OH! and shooting the poodle in the head just topped it for me. Nice touch! Moronic.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun. Entertaining. Graphics good. The challenges/quests are easy. Not only will kids enjoy this game, some adults will also enjoy it.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|Not a bad song on this cd, every one is a hit. Love me some soulful John Hiatt. must hear
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It was Awesome how they intertwined the footage together. I had to chuckle at the special effects but the transporter scenes are still a wonder.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Great cast and story. Some violence and a very good plot. Reminds me of home, West Virgina. Surprising ending. watch
B005MJ8CL8|5.0|Great deluxe edition of Dirt McGirts classic. If you have the extra money to spend, do so. Rest in Peace ODB.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the only real downside is that unless you connect to facebook, there is no way to create an account to save your progress. I had to get a new kindle fire last month after previously having this game for a good amount of time, and it kind if stressed me out that all of my progress was gone.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Of course I am biased as I am a huge fan of Groban, but this cd is excellent.  A great relaxing listen.
B009R659L8|4.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark's stories but this one, although a good read, didn't keep me guessing until the end like so many others.
B0068AWO00|3.0|Fright Night is an okay vampire move.  Truthfully, I never found vampires the least bit frightening- walking around in the dark and sneakily biting people on the neck isn't really scary to me.  It's basically about a teenage boy and his girlfriend constantly running from a much bigger relentless vampire.<br /><br />The good news is that there's a couple segments in Fright Night that are actually really good- the one where the victim, his girlfriend and mother attempt to drive away from the vicious pursuit of the vampire but constantly find themselves struggling to do so due to a sudden speed increase of the vampire who's able to catch up to the vehicle in time to wreak havoc.  I never realized vampires possessed such speed.  Anyway I loved this scene a lot.  I also like the one near the end when the girlfriend opens her mouth abnormally wide preparing to bite down on her boyfriend's face.  This scene is going to give me nightmares!  And I suppose the scene with the teenage boy catching himself on fire and being slammed around by the vampire inside a dark room is pretty suspenseful.<br /><br />I was unaware that vampires need an invitation to enter homes- this is a new piece of information I wasn't aware of.  Unless this aspect is just an exclusive pertaining to *this* particular vampire film.  Also, the amount of blood from all the neck bites is relatively frequent.  I admire it.<br /><br />Much of the storytelling is unforgivably bland and boring, especially the entire first half.  Talking, talking, talking.  It closely resembles a teenage drama.  I was contemplating switching it over but ultimately decided to stick with it.  I'm sort of glad I did, however.  The second half is an improvement.  I guess if you're a fan of vampire movies, well, you'll watch this remake of Fright Night regardless what I or anyone else says, but for those of you not sure if vampires will satisfy a quick horror fix?  I say skip it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This was my first Kate Morton book, and I enjoyed it a lot.  Coming to terms with the shortcomings of our parents is difficult enough without witnessing your mother stabbing a guy to death, and getting away with it, no less!  A great hook to say the least.  There were times during my reading that I felt as if I were there at the farmhouse, it was so charmingly described, and I fell in love with their family as well.  Very nice work.  Still, I did not love this book.  The characters did not feel like real people to me, especially the villains.  Otherwise, the plot, the setting, the traveling back and forth between &#34;now&#34; and &#34;then&#34; made for an enjoyable read.  Other readers mentioned that they guessed the ending; I did not.
B004WR125O|5.0|Love it!!!  Plugged the adapter to my Onkyo TX-NR414 5.1-Channel Network A/V Receiver(Black)  and worked automatically. My receiver already had all the firmware updates so it was a smooth install.

B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I bought this movie because I enjoyed watching it in theaters. It is an unconventional love story that did not relieve as much spotlight as it deserved.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome book, loved it. Great read to sit and enjoy, very suspenseful in the end. Now can't wait to see the movie!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really enjoyed Slammed from the very first moment I started reading it. I loved that Will and Layken found this immediate connection with one another. I was so heartbroken for both of them when they realized that there were obstacles that wouldn't allow them to be together. I did not expect the circumstances they would be under that would keep them apart. It was so hard to see them fight their connection while they were falling deeper in love. Every character in this book was fabulous and there wasn't a single one that I had ill feelings towards. I loved how sweet and caring Will was and how strong and mature he was. I loved that Layken was so headstrong and passionate. She knows what she wants and she is always willing to go for it but at the same time she is so respectful of the situation and does the best she can to not be selfish.<br /><br />I loved the Avett Brothers quotes in the beginning of the chapters and the special meaning they had for Will and Layken. I absolutely adored the theme of this book and the the slam poetry that was incorporated in it. The idea that two people can fight their way to each other through every obstacle thrown there way is such a compelling love story.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not just another ick-fest, World WarZ is a work of intelligent writing of the highest order you find in Genre fiction.<br /><br />Max Brooks writes beautifully and compellingly as he imitates style after style to create characters who witnessed a non-existent event with telling, compelling detail and feeling.<br /><br />That is all you need to say about it except that anyone who can list Studs Turkel and General Sir John Hackett as influences has got to be doing something right.<br /><br />I love this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
055380684X|5.0|Great coaching stories for parents, teenagers or anyone looking to improve their life. Not your average self help book. Especially new parents would enjoy this book as you plan your child's life. Good sound advice and scientific reports. References are worth looking at too. As I home school my child it gives me a lot to think about as I coach my little genius.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I love this movie. Great action, visuals, acting, and humor. As a fan of all of the Star Trek series, I can say this does the universe justice.

B000W1T1JI|4.0|My favorite of the 3 Dio fronted Rainbow albums. I believe LLRR shows a level of maturity not found on the first 2 disc. I dont think theres a bad song on this. The vocals are amazing,Blackmore&#34;s playing is phenominal and the rhythm section is top notch!!!
B00006LFGD|5.0|I love Barbra but wasn't sure I would enjoy her singing with so many different vocalists.  I have to say that Barbara can make even a less than stellar vocalist sound good. Just imagine her singing with the likes of Celine Dion and Judy Garland!
B00BKBJ80G|5.0|I wasnt crazy about the 1987 album, but this cover caught my attention as a horny 17 yr old kid growing up in the deep south. Yes, i bought for the cover. I didnt care for it back then, it wasnt intense enought to serve my needs. As i grew older and also as i grew as a musician i stumbled upon it one day and figured &#34;what the hell?&#34; so i put it in and i think its safe to say i listened to it solid for a week.Since then (10 yrs ago) its been in regular rotation in my stereo. We even do and have done a few covers off of it. Its a great disc and unfortunately is hard to find because Whitesnake was lumped into &#34;that&#34; categorie in the mid-eighties

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson does it again.  By creating a unique magic system all to its own Sanderson quickly pulls us into the world he has created for us.  This short little book packs everything a bigger novel may have to offer into its smaller form.  I paid 8$ for the book but after reading it I would have paid the 15$ the publisher lists the book at.  Get it!  It's worth it!
0316069434|5.0|I have read all the Harry Bosch novels to date. I have to say that The Black Box is one of my favorites. The story is not what it seems!
0060825456|2.0|Quite frankly, I found this rendition of the tale a bit boring. I haven't read the original Coraline, but I assume this graphic novel, adapted and illustrated by P. Craig  Russell, follows it pretty closely.  All the colors are pretty muted in the artwork and it definitely lacks the intensity of other Gaiman graphic novels (I'm thinking the early Sandman Chronicles). Now I love Gaiman's work, so it is a little hard for me to say this: Coraline lacks magic. Yep. There it is. Perhaps I am, in part, saying this because I have seen the animated movie Coraline with all it's colors and odd beauty. So, I went into this graphic novel expecting something similar. Still, with that honesty, I still say it lacks. I almost did not finish it.
B00BEJOMIW|3.0|One of the major cinematic disappointments of its day, the 1974 adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is likely to be reassessed by viewers in lieu of the release of Baz Luhrmann's upcoming, and obviously more flamboyant, version starring Leonardo DiCaprio that opens May 10th. The perfect way to do so is through Warner Home Video's gorgeous new Blu-Ray presentation that, if nothing else, plays to the film's visual strengths.<br /><br />Directed in an apathetic manner by Jack Clayton - whose career ranged from highlights like \\"The Innocents\\" to several disappointments including \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" - \\"The Great Gatsby\\" boasts a script by Francis Ford Coppola, who came into save the expensive Paramount/David Merrick production after Truman Capote's prior adaptation was vetoed by the studio. The film cast Robert Redford as the enigmatic title character, Mia Farrow as Gatsby's eternal flame - Daisy Buchanan, Bruce Dern as her husband Tom, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway, Daisy's second cousin and a new arrival on the Long Island social scene circa 1925.<br /><br />Carraway, who narrates the film and serves as the story's social conscience, watches from a distance as the upper-crust of \\"West Egg\\" commits innumerable acts of selfishness, with Tom cheating on Daisy with the wife (Karen Black) of a local mechanic (Scott Wilson), and Daisy herself rekindling her lost love for the withdrawn Gatsby. As embodied by Redford, Gatsby is a tortured soul whose lavish parties are merely a facade for his emotional longing for Daisy's love. His desire to recapture the past dooms his future, with writer Coppola occasionally foreshadowing the tragedy that eventually befalls the vapid characters of Fitzgerald's novel.<br /><br />Coppola has written that Clayton paid scant attention to his screenplay, but while there's no question the film would've likely fared better with Coppola - at the time coming off the smash success of \\"The Godfather\\" - behind the lens, Clayton does capture enough of Coppola's adaptation that the movie isn't the total loss its reputation would lead you to believe. It's true that the movie's emotional aspect is detached from one end of the film to the other, and that the needed chemistry between Redford and Farrow never sparks (Farrow reportedly wrote that Redford's constant interest in the Watergate scandal kept him glued to the TV set whenever the cameras weren't rolling - something that may explain their lack of chemistry and Redford's disinterested performance). Scenes linger that should've been tightened up while Clayton keeps too much of the film on an even-keeled, dramatic flatline, and familiar faces from Edward Herrmann to Howard Da Silva (who also appeared in \\"Gatsby\\"'s 1949 film version) appear in parts retained from the novel that don't offer any payoff on-screen.<br /><br />Yet \\"The Great Gatsby\\" still functions as an exquisitely good looking period film - a superficial romance that, despite its lack of emotional power, nevertheless manages to captivate for its sense of time and place. Making great use of  Newport, Rhode Island mansions like Rosecliff, Marble House and The Breakers (subbing for Long Island), Clayton and cinematographer Douglas Slocombe capture the gaudy heyday of the `20s in all its beauty and excess. And what more needs to be said about Nelson Riddle's Oscar-winning soundtrack? Beautifully adapted from numerous standards as well as offering an effective, low-key dramatic underscore, Riddle's work on \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is some of his finest. His use of George Gershwin's \\"What I'll Do,\\" weaving in and out of the score from the movie's first frames, is heartbreakingly poignant, and gives the film a soul that its otherwise overly-placid tone lacks. (Here's hoping someone releases Riddle's score on CD at some point soon).<br /><br />The movie's visual appearance, as well as its soundtrack, are both greatly enhanced by Warner's Blu-Ray presentation, which looks pleasingly natural with fine grain and detail present throughout (the details are so distinct you can easily see the old Jamestown [RI] Bridge in the movie's opening minutes). This is a beautiful 1080p AVC encoded presentation and another home run for Warner, releasing their first new title from the Paramount Pictures vaults as part of a recent catalog distribution agreement between the two studios. On the audio end, the 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack is surprisingly robust with a pleasing stereophonic presence.<br /><br />While those expecting \\"The Great Gatsby\\" to become the `70s equivalent of \\"Gone With Wind\\" were severely disappointed, the film is worthy of another look, and Warner's Blu-Ray gives \\"Gatsby\\" a stellar presentation that adds to its visual and aural appeal.

B00CL0J99K|5.0|I thought that Iron Man 3 was one of the best movies of 2013. When Tony Star faces his greatest foe ever, it puts his friends in danger. When Tony is unable to use the suit, he must use his smarts to get his Iron Man suit up and running again to help save the world.<br /><br />I love this one as Tony puts aside his image when his friends are in danger and has to fight without his suit at times.. He is dealing with nightmares and the fact that one of his co workers is nearly killed when an attack happened at a theater... The moral of the story is being a hero is more then the suit.. It comes from Inside you....<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr gives a great performance as Tony Stark and I consider this installment THE best of the series...

B000002S4V|5.0|I first encountered the pianist Solomon performing the Beethoven Sonata 8 in c minor.  Always thought highly of his passionate, yet classically contained interpretations.  The clarity of his voicing was beyond reproach and his tone was solid as well as poetic. I never bought another recording of him until this EMI issue was released.  The magic is back. What I liked then, I like now.  Such gorgeous  playing featuring lyric, romantic phrasing works well along with the propelling motion he can sustain.  One of the finest late Beethoven sets around. Grab it while it's here!

B004PVKFR8|4.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a few weak tracks such as a spoken snippet and a bunch of dead air at the end of Knights of Shame that are jarring when listening to the album on repeat.  Without those I would have given it five stars. Very enjoyable listen and I don't think that Sail is the only good song on here by any means, although it *is* still my favorite.  I have listened to the album for a couple days on repeat while working (as I tend to do to really test out how I like an album) and this one is a solid winner.

I've never written a review for an album, but I am just so in love with this one - I hope I never tire of it and I hope the next effort the band puts out is every bit this good.  The way the growls blend in \\"In Due Time\\" is crazy.  The live version of My Curse is just fantastic.  Man, I love this band.
B00BEJOMIW|3.0|With a new Baz Luhrmann Gatzby film upon us, I thought it would be interesting to take a look and this 1974 version.  By my count this is the 4th adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel including a \\"lost\\" silent version.  Francis Ford Coppola handled the screenplay and stays pretty true to the book.  Maybe too much so.  It's not the dialog so much that is wrong, it's the long silences between exchanges.  At times I felt like I was watching a daytime soap opera.<br /><br />Mia Farrow is miscast in the critical role of Daisy Buchanan, the waifish heiress who marries the brutish Tom (Bruce Dern), himself of old money.  Jay Gatsby (Robert Redford) is the mysterious millionaire on the other side of Long Island, living \\"across the yard\\" from Nick Carraway, the film's narrator and Daisy's second cousin \\"once removed.\\"  Nicely played by Sam Waterson, Nick seems to love Daisy as much as Jay or certainly Tom.<br /><br />The source of Gatsby's fortune is never clear but the implication is that it came from a series of illegal activities, likely to include bootlegging.  Set in the post WW I early twenties, Gatsby's not very sociable but does spring for daily parties at his opulent house.  Jay and Nick strike up a friendship which allows a reunion between Jay and Daisy who were romantically involved for a short period, prior to Jay shipping off to war.<br /><br />Other characters become critical to the story.  Scott Wilson from TV's \\"The Walking Dead\\" is very good as George Wilson a garage owner whose wife, Myrtle (Karen Black) is having a not-so-secret affair with Tom.  Daisy's best friend, golfer Jordan Baker is played by yummy Lois Chiles.  She's in many of the scenes but the filmmakers give her little to do but just look good.<br /><br />The production values of the film are excellent and produced a couple Oscars (costume design, music scoring).  Everyone dresses \\"to the nines\\" throughout the film.  Often dressing in white and even Redford in a pink 3-piece suit, the film looks great, especially in this Blu ray offering.  The Blu ray brings out some great detail but also shows some flaws.  Set during a summer heat wave, the characters are often dripping with facial sweat, but there is not a hint of perspiration around the collars.  In one scene Redford is wearing a white cable knit sweater.  Yikes!  The film is great to look at, but director Jack Clayton's glacial pacing is hard to take.  It might have been different had there been any chemistry between Redford and Farrow.  Had Gatsby gone after Chiles' character, now that would have been a better match.<br /><br />The new Blu Ray edition is a significant step up from the dull DVD.  The transfer has an AVC encoded 1080p resolution with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The movie looks very film-like with goodly amounts of grain and with sharp detail.  There are many close-ups used in the film and the skin coloring looked perfect to me.  I can't fault the video transfer.  Likewise the audio has been upgraded to a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The surrounds kick in when the music starts, which is often. There are several lengthy party scenes and this is where you'll get the full 5.1 experience.  Otherwise the dialog is properly focused up front.  There are no special features or extras.  None, zero, nada, zip.he film looks great, especially in this Blu ray offering.

B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've been a Jump Desktop user for over a year, and it has consistently been one of my top five apps. No intrusive permissions, no complex setup, and it JUST WORKS. It uses an *optional* program installed on your desktop which avoids the need for static IPs or dynamic DNS.  Or, if you already have your IP, no client is necessary - it uses plain-jane RDP.  For advanced users, it will let you setup an SSH tunnel from within the app, giving you an extra layer of security without the need of proprietary add-ons. Plus, if you're not using a pro version of Windows, or you're a Mac or Linux user, it also supports VNC.  On top of all this, it's super fast, very responsive, and the controls are great. If you add a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse (completely optional!), it makes for a nearly perfect solution to portable mobile computing.

B000V4UFZK|4.0|Coming to this after it's been around for a quarter of a century makes me wonder what else I have been missing in life. It's not a classic, by any means, but it is a very good one without the off-putting horror shots (gore, heads being squished, bloody body parts being tossed around, etc.) which are accepted today. Both the leads do well individually and as a couple, while the two younger kids are guided to be quite satisfactory. The oldest child is pretty much left out of the action. Of the \\"specialists in the supernatural\\", Zelda Rubinstein, as the expert at house cleaning (of poltergeist), does quite well in her first film. She is gone now.<br />From the discussion of the guiding spirits for the film (see the editorial reviews and some of the others) clearly it must have been Spielberg who kept the lid on the horrors and the emphasis on the family and the familiar. If so, it was providential for the film since it is the difference between an audience of devotees and younger people and an audience of everybody.<br />At any rate, I commend the film to those who have not yet seen it. It has not aged at all, although lacking in the technological advances that people have come to expect. It is still a good people movie, the essence of longevity of appeal for an audience.

1433537427|5.0|I was looking for a Bible that had a newer translation than my NIV...and I heard a lot of the pastors say that this is a really great version. I'm really satisfied with the Bible so far and it has many color notes inside each page that makes it very informative, but a bit more bulky than a personal Bible. However, I would still recommend this to anyone who wants a nice ESV Study Bible. The cover  is imitation leather like it was stated above...feels a little cheaper than my other leather Bible, but still like the feeling of this one. Would recommend this to any one who is looking for a great translation. I bought it from amazon because it was any where from $30-40 in local Christian bookstores.

The only way to hear a mix in stereo is by inserting the cable only about 1/3rd of the way in. It's annoying and I'll have to bring it to my tech for repair costing me more than the actual product.<br /><br />Expected more out of the company.

I have carried one for many months now in my pocket and it is pretty scratched up, but works perfectly.  I bought this one for my fiance for her keychain and she has loved it as well.  Plus with battery junction selling 123a batteries for under a dollar a piece it is also quite economical!

0307474259|5.0|I found Gary Taubes' book after being 30 pounds into a diet and frustrated.  A doctor had suggested a ketogenic diet and I had decided the doctor was nuts, and was trying desperately to prove that he was a quack.  That is when I started reading this book and did not find what I was expecting.  Instead of finding proof that my doctor needed to be reported for malpractice, I was introduced to a wealth of information that explained my unending hunger and insulin resistance.  I've since lost an additional 25 pounds in 2 months and cutting my carbohydrates from a former probably 200 grams/day to now 20-30/day has gotten rid of my insulin resistance, lethargy, and the neverending hunger that would gnaw at my stomach.  I was so used to trying to ignore my hunger because I didn't want to gain anymore weight, and I've learned to trust my internal dinner bell again.  If you want your body to function as it should, you need to break your carb ADDICTION.  Read this book.  Try getting rid of sugar and grains and rooted vegetables for a month.  If you don't like it, you can always go back to eating a bunch of carbs and continue gaining weight.

006224454X|4.0|Before I Go To Sleep is a very engaging thriller about a woman named Christine, who awakes every morning having no idea what happened on the day before, or some whole years before that. The writing was sharp and pragmatic, and I loved how it wasn't overly flourished and yet somehow poetic, the words kind of flowed from the first sentence to the last in one one delicious stream of chills. I liked the atmosphere S.J. Watson set for the book, the murky, rainy skies of London, cobblestone streets and old cafes, and even psychiatric wards. I wouldn't say the book got properly creepy up until the end, but when the chills arrived, dear lord, they were good.<br /><br />I could picture everything perfectly, and actually took the time to do so, which I usually don't bother with when authors think it appropriate to use similes and/or metaphors every two sentences, and that just made the experience more real and enthralling to me, because I took my time with the twists and turns and even the parts where not much was going on. I didn't see the ending coming from kilometers away, it didn't even occur to me, really, which was very refreshing.<br /><br />Overall, Before I Go To Sleep is a thriller with a very original concept that can surprise you at every turn and make you feel for and with this amnesiac woman fighting for the most basic of things, to remember her own life. I'll be sure to buy S.J. Watson's next books, whenever they're released.
B003QSMC18|5.0|I love disney movies. They play to the kid at heart and in general I really like them. This movie, however, was not what I was expecting and I loved it so much more for that. This is the best &#34;princess&#34; movie they have ever made and is a positive thing for girls to aspire to (unlike the other princess movies where their only hope is to find a rich prince) This is a great movie!
B00632HWOG|2.0|This was one of the first apps I got on my kindle fire about a year and a half ago. It was good. It always worked, and I never had any issues. THEN they had to go and &quot;update&quot; it, and essentially ruined it. I know they were trying to add to it to make it better, but instead they ruined it. Its very buggy. I can never get my messages to update. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it several times hooping that will be it, but it is just a quick fix. it is annoying. they need to either go back to the way it was or figure something else out because this just isn't. working!
B00BESM14U|3.0|I watched this movie because I like the actors who are in it. It wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't one of those ones that I would want to watch again. If you're a fan of the book then you may like this movie more. I thought it was just very slow with random bursts of almost unbearably embarrassing moments thrown in. It's not bad. It's not good. It's just eh.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Excellent movie. would watch it over and over again and I still do.<br />They main characters were great. this movie shows the ups and downs  of the strip life.<br />shows how strong the drugs take part...jo
B0098VXE50|5.0|First of, if you don't like Kristen Stewart, you are not magically going to decide she is an amazing actress just by watching this movie. You either love her or you hate her, that's your problem. As for the movie itself, it is my favorite version of snow white. The artistry with which this movie is done and the primal state they put snow white into is just brilliant. I recommend it.

B000MRA5EM|4.0|If you are looking for a fun documentary about ocean life, this is a great buy for the price. with narration by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, Looks real good if you have a big t.v. over 50&#34;.

B005NKGEP2|3.0|This book is both timely and fun: the plot involves an electronic currency heist, marital tension, and many concerns of a wife whose past life is not all it seems. Is her husband as duplicitous as she is? And who is investigating whom?
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is a great little game.  The graphics are cute and it has many word categories, even different languages.  Great for the plane, waiting for an appointment or if you just want to play with words.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I REALY LIKE the game, but Mojang is a week late for the 0.7.0 update!<br />Mojang needs to be more precise on their release dates! :-)

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie. Great story line and great acting.Jamie Foxx was excellent. Casting was good and overall this movie was the best one I have seen this year.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|I enjoyed the book very &#34;boys own&#34;&#34;  but not as good as some of his earlier work, how much of this did he write?
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Perhaps it's my age or perhaps it's the times but Bugg has come up with something that's been missing for 30 years in a package that others just might get.  Simply put, he writes his own music in a way that is both poetic and accessible.  There are flaws here and there in the production of the album but one comes to accept and even enjoy them with repeated listening.  It all seems to make sense.  Considering his age, Bugg has an uncanny sense of his world and is able to convey that through lyric and music.  At times, one has to chuckle at the, sometimes, jaded life he presents when we know he's only 19 years old - but, once again, he manages to pull it off.  On the other hand, there are 19 year olds who have \\"seen it all\\".<br /><br />As for musicianship, he's truly fine.  If you listen to earlier recordings, he sometimes (rarely) has timing issues and pitch problems but those have evaporated in the short time (a year and a half) he's catapulted from total unknown to shooting star.  He is one of the most musical people recording today.  His melodic sense is enchanting.  People like to say he has a gravely voice and that both his voice and songs are reminiscent of a young Bob Dylan.  Quite a compliment but I think I actually like him better than Dylan and his songs make more sense.  His voice isn't gravely either - it's just different.  At times it's nasally but he's really studied it and his voice is unmistakable, a very unique signature without any pretense.<br /><br />He's pure and simple, extremely melodic as well as an adept player. Most of all, he sings from the heart where we discover his tenderness, vulnerability and honesty.  Our world has become jaded and too complicated a place where savoring a song that might touch your heart has seemingly gone by the wayside.  There is nothing shallow about Jake Bugg.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved all the books and characters I wish a 4th book would come out GO minho, newt Thomas,Brenda,Jorge and the others
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is a great musical!  Very enjoyable,  good  for the whole family, a wonderful love story, filmed to make the audience feel like you are in the theater.  I  would recommend film to anyone who likes Opera.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app/game is the best app I have ever purchased there are so many things that you can do on this game with an imagination. I thought it would be no match for the pc but it is really good.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The story line is interesting.  It took a little longer to get into the book, and then I was hooked
B0046ECJBY|5.0|I thought Mr. Kissinger's book The History of Diplomacy was a very good and informative book.On China however is a must read for any one who wants to understand the history of why the Chinese Government reacts the way they do to world events.

1476733953|3.0|I have always enjoyed SciFi especially post-apocalyptic stories and after seeing so many 5 star reviews I thought this would be something special.  Well, it never did really grab me.  It was certainly a good read, good story, good characters, etc.  But.............I would have liked to have known more about what caused the need for the survivors to bury themselves in these silos, and more about the relationship between the silos.  Who was running them and why they behaved the way they did.  But the thing that really seem to keep me from enjoying the book more and this may be nit picking is that after so many generations and years that the silos are able to sustain themselves.  With thousands of people in each silo the requirements for every conceivable item would be enormous, especially food, power, water, medicine, technology,  Somehow it just didn't seem realistic that they could continue to provide for all the needs of that many people for that long a period without factories, refineries, large scale farming etc. etc.  How do you replace anything that is the least bit high tech.  They have all those computers which we know in reality are relatively fragile and wear out fairly quickly amd require hard to get materials.  Mining from the bottom of the silo?...........oil drilling?  All not at all realistic.  Frankly I think the whole premise is so unrealistic that a silo could not continue for generation after generation.  So that pretty much made me not buy into the whole premise
B00999DFP0|5.0|If you enjoy the Big Bang, then this is a must buy.  Good buy if you want to catch up on any missed several episodes.
B00881PTRC|4.0|This is easy to learn and fun to play.  A great way to work on vocabulary/spelling.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that when you miss a word, the AI fills in the missing letters with this neon yellow that is almost impossible to read unless you are in a dark room or shade.  Every time I want to see what I missed I have to cup my hands around the screen to I can see the missing letters and even then sometimes it's impossible to read.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Just saw it, as usual, STAY UNTIL THE END END END of the film.<br /><br />I want just the DVD. I don't want the blu-ray. Why are they combined?
0399162097|5.0|The most absorbing books I read have a vital lesson at their core: they teach me what it means to be human.  Karen Joy Fowler's latest book tackles this crucial theme and by doing so, captured my heart and reduced me to tears.<br /><br />There is no getting around that this is an agenda book.  Ms. Fowler's purpose is to show us--through fiction--that the most complicated animal - the human animal can be disastrous to the rest of the animal kingdom through sheer arrogance.<br /><br />Typically, I avoid authorial intrusion like the plague.  But this book was so compulsively readable, so original, and so psychologically nuanced that I couldn't help but turn the pages compulsively.<br /><br />Rosemary Cooke, our narrator, is the daughter of a family of scientists.  It takes her 77 pages to reveal a central truism of her life (which, inexplicably, is revealed by the publisher on every book blurb about this novel):  she spent the first eighteen years of her life defined by the fact that she was raised as \\"twins\\" with a chimpanzee named Fern.<br /><br />\\"I tell you Fern is a chimp and already, you aren't thinking of her as my sister,\\" Ms. Fowler writes.  \\"You're thinking instead that we loved her as if she were some kind of pet.\\"  But that just wasn't so.  Rosemary astutely realized that her father was not really studying whether chimps could communicate as humans.  Rather, he is asking, \\"can Rosemary learn to speak to chimpanzees.\\"<br /><br />Fern is sent away when Rosemary turns five, for reasons that remain obscure through most of the book.  But her absence affects Rosemary the way the sudden disappearance of a sister would.  By the time she goes to kindergarten, her mother must work with her to stand up straight, not put her fingers into anyone's mouth or hair, not jump on tables and desks when she is playing, not bite anyone.<br /><br />Her whole life is impacted by the \\"experiment\\" of being raised with her sister Fern.  \\"What a scam I pulled off!\\" Rosemary reflects. \\"What a triumph.  Apparently, I'd finally erased all those little cues, those maters of personal space, focal distance, facial expression, vocabulary.  Apparently all you needed to be considered normal was no evidence to the contrary.\\"<br /><br />I believed in the connection between Rosemary and Fern.  This emotionally devastating book - which folds back on itself to reveal more and more of the story through false and real memories - confirms what I have long believed: that the rest of the animal kingdom has much to teach us in being human.\\"What a triumph.

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Loved this film, especially the twist at the end. I like most of Depps work as I find him to be professional and full of depth. Nice to see him get away from being (far too frequently) so quirky all of the time. I like most of his films, but he plays so many quirky roles that people don't get to see his more serous side that often. This is one of those that shows his true talent as an actor
1423140591|5.0|Great book! The book starts with Percy running from the to Gorgan sisters. Percy then decides it would be a fabulous idea to plummet down a very steep hill on a snack tray. After that, he arrives at the Roman camp and meets Hazel, daughter of Pluto and Frank, son of Mars. Then they go on a quest and a lot of very unfortunate things happen to them. Then they find the object of their quest, and ride home on Arion, a horse who can go faster then the speed of light and swears all the time. Once they get back to camp, the is mysterious news that a magical Greek tirme is hovering over camp....The End.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I can see why this book appeals to readers in teens and 20s who have yet to explore top notch romance.  For me, not so much.  I love me a good romance, but so often the characters become  cliche (look at me, I'm a bad boy with tattoos, a motorcycle and I punch people because I have issues) and trite (gosh, he's just such a jerk, but I can't help what my heart wants, tra la) in modern romance and that is when it is hard to get invested in them for me.  To be fair, I am only a little over half finished and I've set this one down to be forgotten.  (And I am usually dogged in my determination to finish a difficult or tricky book, just not....blah.). I felt like I was watching an episode of MTVs Real World, with no commercial breaks to at least temper the narcissistic meandering of college kids that have waaaay too much time on their hands.  When I started to feel as hung over as the characters without even one jello-o shot, I had to call it quits.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|The characters and situations described were cartoonish and stereotyped.  The voices and vocabularies of the characters were roughly identical.  But I'd wager it wasn't really meant to be great fiction.  I read it to understand the challenges IT faces and the importance of rational processes instead of heroics in addressing those challenges.  I'm giving it 4 stars (5-1 because it's not great fiction).  It helped me to viscerally understand these challenges and frustrations, and gain a better understanding of how I might change my approaches to things at work.  To me, it was a great alternative to reading a bunch of schollarly articles (that I would never have gotten though) on DevOps and process improvements.  The fact that it was fictionalized (even if not exceptionally well) made it infinitely more consumable.  I appreciate that and it benefited me.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|There were many gaps and inconsistancies, things left unexplained and the story  did not seem to hang together. Additionally, the story was grim. Not my kind of movie.
B00002N9ER|5.0|My Maglites keep on rolling and bouncing around in various transport vehicles, so they experience more wear and tear from this action than from actual use.  The solution was to secure them, and these clamps work just fine.  It even came with mounting screws appropriate for mounting on wood.  It is an elegant solution to a commonplace issue.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|Good performances from all the actors. I bought this to replace my VHS copy as I am still updating my older movies while trying to keep up with the new stuff.
1423140605|5.0|Great book! At the beginning of the book, Annabeth, Piper, Leo, Coach Hedge, and Jason, are about to land in Camp Jupiter. Unfortunately, Leo gets possessed by a eidolon and bombs the Roman camp. The crew of the Argo II leve in haste. Then they must find Nico, and (hopefully) stop two twin giants who plan to destroy Rome. Annabeth also has to go on her own quest to follow the Mark of Athena, which ultimately leads to Percy Annabeth falling into Tartarous. Then, DUN DUN DUN.......the end of the book.<br /><br />You know, a movie for this book would be interesting....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have three apps on there different devices.  This app is the best.  Easy to use.  The view fills the Kindle Fire screen making it so easy to see.  Also only app I've seen with the percentage calculator saving steps and time when you are shopping etc...  Love it!
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I've read ALL Mr. Coelho's books, and this is one of greatest...heartwarming, wake up call, full of hope. I recommend this book to anyone...
B00633PFQC|4.0|As a die hard capitalist this book was certainly not exactly my cup of tea but the author does make some good points and makes you think about our society as a whole. I specifically liked some of his ideas on letting the market decide prices but he has a point about over commercializing of public and sports stadium areas. His point.. Is everything for sale?? This book will upset the strictest of capitalist and pacify some socialist but it will also make you think a bit and see things from a different perspective.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|Good animation, and an interesting twist to the story, but somehow after all of the hype and an investment of several hours, it left me with a vague feeling of dis-satisfaction.  The inherent sense of reality/unreality was intentional to keep the viewer off balance, but being off balance can be disorienting.  It would have been a much better flick had I not heard all of the hype beforehand, and hand lower expectations.
B000FC2NGM|5.0|This is the best book ever made.<br />it is a mystery and a huge adventure. You have to read . AWESOME.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|I finally bought a good Marantz CD player with a good DAC (did I say I was &#34;old school&#34; yet?), and have really enjoyed this set.  It's hard to believe the sound could be much better even not remastered.  One of the classic bands, and this set is well worth the price.  Unlike some of the reviews, my vinyl isn't in that good of shape any more.  This is a worthy replacement set.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This book is great for when you want something fun and mysterious to read. A little too Twilight for me at times, however that is not going to keep me from reading the second book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sometimes it's light but it's really fun it gives u something to go for like trying to get a million. Also the game is like temple run but way better I mean the prizes are better and j get unlock more characters.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I may not have gotten every single reference, but knew enough about the ones used that I kept up. An extremely creative book, surprising, laugh-out-loud fun! I've recommended it to everyone in my age group. :)
B007REV4T8|4.0|Aging issues and the demise of Judi Dench as &#34;M&#34; weave a not so fine thread through this one.  This is understandable, in view of this fifty year old film franchise recognizing the aging demographics of its audience.  It is a nice variation from the usual Bond motif, and unfortunately, one that likely strikes home for most of the audience.  The manic irrational antagonist with his single minded obsession oft reminds me of certain seller ratings obsessed vendors.  Nuff said.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game is terrible! I wish I would have read the reviews more thoroughly, I would have avoided wasting my money! There is no hint or help,to get you through the game,makes no sense. This game is very frustrating not fun or relaxing. Save your money and purchase a game that is helpful and you enjoy  playing. I will never purchase a game from this company. My money needs to be refunded. If I could I would have rated no stars it is that bad!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I can only imagine how Robert Jordan would have ended it.  It was a good read but there was just that little something missing.  Brandon did a good job but I just miss Robert Jordan's touch and soul that he gave the series.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Well written,  tied all the pieces together and answered any questions from the previous books. Would love a book about Rand's children or even more about what happens to everyone now.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I loved the Saxon Chronicles, I wish there were a dozen more books in the series! Well written and hard to put down.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Iron Man 3 is an improvement over the last installment, so it is a bummer that it ultimately lacks a clear and memorable villain. Ben Kingsley is a great actor of course and his acting is fine here, but without giving too much away, I feel cheated by the advertisements. I will leave it at that. Robert Downey Jr. turns in his best Tony Stark performance yet. I don't like his ego in reality, but he sure was made to play this character.<br /><br />The CGI is of the highest quality as expected and while most of the movie lacks action, the final act easily makes up for it. In Iron Man 3 you get more Tony Stark the man than you get Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit.<br /><br />The writing is pretty good and there are some very funny lines, but it can almost get too silly at times. They also felt the need to throw out references to what happened in The Avengers film every so often. We get it.<br /><br />IMAX 3-D was not really worth it. The 3-D was done after the fact and it only added so minor depth.<br /><br />For the first BIG movie of 2013 it is a good start. Here is hoping that Star Trek: Into Darkness and Man of Steel bring a little more to the table.
B00991TCOG|5.0|When I first heard of Lindsey Stirling about 3 months ago, I fell in love with the sound of her music, it is energetic, relaxing, and the combination of violin and the beat are phenomenal. I would recommend this album and artist to anyone tired of mainstream music, and wants to listen to something entirely different or just looking for some new music to add to their library, either way I believe you will be satisfied with what you hear and feel.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The whole family enjoyed the movie very much. They did a wonderful job on all the especial effects.  Totally recommend it.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant as Lincoln. I loved Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens. The movie made the last weeks of the Civil War and the Lincoln administration very human and personal.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|It was just like watching an episode of castle ....I could feel the sexual tension between them! A must read
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like minecraft because you get to create your own personal things and you can make your own bed- you can also trap a chicken in your house if you have a personal pen- so I rate this app a 20
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|From the first page I was drawn in to this beautifully written, compassionately told story.  Filled with humor and the joys and woes of real life, I was reminded of stories from our beloved Maeve Binchy.  Hated to finish it and I would hope that Christina McKenna continues to regale us with more wonderful tales!

B00C5ZORES|4.0|The following is a verbatim copy from my review at: [...]<br /><br />The new Fall Out Boy album, Save rock and Roll, came out a few weeks ago after five long years.  Having listened to it about a half dozen times now, I figured I had a good enough handle on it for a review.  For context, I enjoyed the last three albums. I enjoyed Folie &agrave; Deux the most – I felt it was the peak of their maturity both musically and lyrically. (According to a recent Rolling Stone article, I’m in the minority)<br /><br />This album overall has a dance anthem feel to it. There were danceable elements to previous albums, but this one really seems to go for a dance rhythm.<br /><br />The Phoenix – The album starts off extremely strong, setting the tone. I really enjoy this song.<br /><br />My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up) – Lyrically, this song is the first to sound more like the older albums, although the music continues to be more of a dance vibe than previous songs. It’s a great first single since it is pretty representative of the rest of the album.<br /><br />Alone Together – I’ve long been a sucker for call and response songs. So I love the chorus with: Say Yeah (Yeah)/Let’s Be Alone Together (Yeah). While still maintaining the energy of the album as a whole, this is the first song that sounds musically like the previous albums.<br /><br />Where Did the Party Go – But right after that similar sounding song, we jump right back into the dance anthems. It makes sense considering it’s called Where Did the Party Go. Interestingly, I find the song to lyrically be similar to the old Panic! At the Disco songs, while seeming like a song you’d throw on at a party.<br /><br />Just One Yesterday (featuring Foxes) – I like the use of the corny pickup line as the root of this song. “Anything you say can and will be held against you/Say my name and it will be held against you”. While, they have had some collaborations like Jay-Z in the past, this album seems to have the most use of guest singers. Foxes makes a GREAT contribution here, similar to Kina Grannis on I Fight Dragon’s With You. She contributes both background vocals and a verse.<br /><br />The Mighty Fall (featuring Big Sean) – This is a great. bombastic song that I could see a lot of people playing as an FU song to others. I’m not a huge fan of Big Sean’s part, but it’s not horrible.<br /><br />Miss Missing You – Another huge song, this time a carrying-the-torch song. The biggest theme of this album is HUGE sound. This is not a subtle albm.<br /><br />Death Valley – The pace picks up a bit from the song and then drops everything but acoustic guitar for a quarter of a verse. The music is in top form on this album.  They’re not afraid to go from an all out musical assault to as sparse as possible if that’s what the song needs at the moment including guitar distortion at the end.<br /><br />Young Volcanoes – A milder anthem that could almost be an easy listening track. It’s the mildest track on here and I swing back and forth between enjoying it (especially for the lyrics) and hating it for sounding so bubble-gum.  But the one song I truly dislike is the next one.<br /><br />Rat a Tat (featuring Courtney Love) – Maybe I’m a bit poisoned by Danielle’s almost vitriolic hatred of Courtney Love, but I really don’t like this song. I don’t like the disorganized and almost discordant sound of the song. Which sucks because, as with the previous song, I actually like the Fall Out Boy-sung lyrics. But the song just does nothing for my ears.<br /><br />Save Rock and Roll (featuring Elton John() – This is the final track and I think it ends perfectly. While there an always be a case made for ending an album on an exciting note, I think it’s always nice to end an album on an introspective note. Not only that, but Elton John’s contribution is the best collaboration on the album.<br /><br />I think with this album, Fall Out Boy has both reinvented themselves while remaining true enough to transition those of us who are older fans over to this new sound.  I recommend it whether you’re a fan of their old stuff or stayed away (as I did for too long) because you didn’t identify with “emo” or thought they were a band for teen and pre-teen girls to listen to. If we can keep getting strong albums like this, 2013 is going to be a great year for music.both reinvented themselves while remaining true enough to transition those of us who are older fans over to this new sound.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|There was a lot of action in this movie.  The acting was superb.  I watched it several times and could alway find something new in it to see.  I wish there was more movies like this.  Action with no nudity or foul language.

B005OKTPKC|4.0|Grisham is such a page-turner and this book while not the most gripping of his repertoire, is still a good read.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I have loved Diana Ross since the beginning.  She has such a lovely voice and stage performance.  Saw here in concert and she was awesome.  Her outfit were also dazzling, which she only changed five (5) times.  She gave the Durham DPAC about a 2 hour show.  I would love to see her come back.  Therefore, this DVD was just a nice and made you feel apart of the crowd in New York.
B008602KQI|5.0|i got to watch this for no charge with my prime account and loved it.  I can not wait for the sequel.  My prime account has payed for itself many times over with all the unlimited streaming and 2 day shipping.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|When I first saw this book it truly intrigued me but I was unsure, till I got into its exquisite pages with many sorrows and happiness intertwined together. I recommend it to readers who want to expand their understanding of the wonders in earth and the thought of beyond. I had a very difficult time putting this journey to a man's soul, and even my own down because it was a great read that I really enjoyed.
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|I've been a lifelong Deep Purple fan. I own EVERY studio album they have made. This ranks up there with the best. Very well crafted songs. Ian Gillan is at the top of his game. I really think this is the best he has sounded since the early 70's! It's great to hear what Don Airey brings to the band. He has a style very similar to Jon Lord, but I hear hints of Keith Emerson in there too. Steve Morse is brilliant, as always. Roger Glover and Ian Paice are rock solid and probably the most underrated rhythm section in hard rock! Do yourself a favor and grab this. It's a real treat.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Views on the presidency that I had not even thought of or realized.  Good setting, after one has been the President does one have friends?  Interesting to hear the stories and to know the other half of the history.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|You have to read the conclusion to the trilogy!<br />A bit forgetable but that's because it ties up the loose ends created in the first two books.<br />I wasn't disappointed.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Overall this movie wasn't very good, from the trailer it looked like not only did it contain some pretty cool action scenes but also a very well written and acted out script, unfortunately this wasn't the case. This film was overall very disappointing for what looked like at first glance another great modern crime drama.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|As an adult--an older adult at that--reading a book written for teenagers, I found COB interesting but not riveting. The writing, the plot development, just about everything was not that great, but the story did hold together long enough for me to finish reading this this morning, though it took me more than a week. (I think I read all three &#34;Hunger Game&#34; books in a single weekend, by comparison. I will probably give the next book in the series a try once the price comes down, but it is not on my &#34;must read&#34; list.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Works great, no problems.  Allows me access to any information that I may need.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|NEGATIVE -100 STARS. If you are into Cannabalism and 3 Hours of Non-Stop Random-ness filled with GORY VIOLENT DEATH SCENES such as: splattered brain suicides, knife-in-throat gutting, animal abuse, human-to-human flesh eating, and other such delights...then this is the movie for you!<br /><br />Aside from the senseless violence....you will find that although made from the creators of The Matrix, this movie was about the WORST movie you will EVER watch!<br /><br />There was NO cohesive plot other than the same old rehashed Apocalyptic Sci-Fi junk done decades ago.<br />I seriously tried with ALL my might to sit through this movie and find ANY substance or meaning that would keep my interest.<br />I could not find a single thing about this movie that was noteworthy, other than....I liked that it was over in just 3 SHORT hours.<br /><br />Towards the end of the movie when ole' Tom Hanks starts gutting some guy's throat with a blade, I almost RALPHED ALL OVER MY BOYFRIEND!!<br />But I found it even more DISGUSTINGLY DISTURBING when The Agent aka Hugo Weaving from the Matrix shoots a poor little puppy in the head.<br />-<br /><br />Not really sure what the Wachowski Brothers were going for with this one....but it sounds like they wanted to subject the viewer and their<br />families to CRUEL ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND INHUMANE-NESS in order to make them feel some kind of emotion. But all I felt like was GETTING UP AND<br />TURNING THE TV OFF.<br /><br />15 minutes into the movie I realized that the plot was NOT going to get better and the \\"parallel lives\\" concept they were shooting for was filled<br />with nothing but SHALLOW-NESS and an excuse to bring back a knock-off version of NEO (from the Matrix) with a bad face lift.<br /><br />As they said it best in Adam Sandler's Billy Madison flik, what they've just done with this movie here is: \\"one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever seen.<br />At no point in their rambling, incoherent scenes was there ANYTHING that couldeven be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this theater is now DUMBER for having watched it. I award them NEGATIVE STARS, and may God have NO MERCY on their soul!\\"
B000QCUB8I|5.0|The CD is really nice, not a single scratch and everything else looked good. Also, it did not take that long for it to arrive.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|While this movie doesn't follow the written story of the Hobbit to the letter, I think what they've done is very good and I look forward to seeing the next part.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book.  Amazing insight into the lives of people on this small island during WW II.  I felt like I knew these people and want to go there to live.  Will this author be writing more books like this???  I hope so!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|First, be aware that even though this appears to be \\"free\\", when you get about halfway through, you will need to pay $4.99 to finish the game. The good part about that is you can try it out and not have to pay if you don't want to finish it. However, it would be nice if they clearly stated the fee in the description. It says there are in-app purchases available, but to me, that doesn't make it clear that you must make a purchase if you want to complete the game.<br /><br />The game itself is decent, but not up to par with some others, like the Fire Maple games (The Lost City, The Secret of Grisly Manor) which cost only a buck each. The Lost City, in particular, is a robust adventure which gives your mind a really good workout. Dark Arcana: the Carnival has its moments of challenge, but the designers seemed to have gotten lazy in the last 25% or so of the game. For instance, in Lost City, you'll arrive at some locations which have puzzles you don't know how to solve yet and you'll need to be on the lookout for clues for them as you continue, but there are lots of other locations to explore in the meantime. Also in Lost City, you find objects and clues along the way which you might not need until much further along in the program. In contrast, in Dark Arcana: the Carnival, especially toward the end, you reach a stumbling block and need to back track to find a way to get through. Then reach another stumbling block and back track to find a way to get through again. In other words, instead of building a collection of loose ends to keep your mind working, you just tackle each problem as you come to it.<br /><br />On the plus side, the graphics are really high quality. I also liked the fact that hidden object searches are downplayed. There are some hidden object scenes, but they aren't the main activity of the game and you have the option to play a matching game instead of doing the hidden object searches if you like. You also can skip the puzzles and get hints, so the likelihood of getting stuck and not being able to move on is slim.<br /><br />All in all, it's better than most adventure game apps, but there are even better ones for a lot less money.
B008A5H70S|5.0|is a product of very good quality, brand and price. I recommend it to all people who are in search of something. Besides, it is very nice, I loved it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I like this series but I have one complaint.it is too repetitious. Jason is like Percy, Leo is like Grover , and Piper is kind of like Annabeth. I enjoy Rick Riordan, but other than Frank and Hazel, it is practically the same characters with different features and different names.  However, my love of this author's books, and his overall writing and plot sucked me in and I loved it. THEREFORE,IT TOTALLY DESERVES FIVE STARS!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|If you have only seen the movie, then this book will surprise you. It is very different from the movie. Of course, the movie is an American classic, but the book is an almost unknown treasure. I highly recommend this book. It would be good for young and old alike.
B005FNJL7K|5.0|Great music.  Could only be better in DVD or Blu-Ray.  Hopefully one of these days they will do that--then we'll have what we want.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I'm addicted!!!  I go to this game all the time to try to increase my levels.  It keeps my interest too long because I don't want to stop playing.
0446547573|5.0|I missed the movie but will purchase it as soon as I can on DVD.  I'm glad I read the book first.
B006ROGU84|5.0|Great book by my favorite author! The book was a little damaged but no torn pages. Fun book and gets you into the spriti of Christmas
B000BVXC7Q|5.0|This is a finely orchestrated and performed set of R. Strauss' orchestral music. You may find individual pieces performed by other great conductors such as von Karajan (Ein Heldenleben and Also sprach Zarathustra, or the Alpine Symphony). Both R. Kempe and Staatskapel orchestra in Dresden are brilliant in bringing up some of the finest - yet unknown - musical works of R. Strauss. This is the same set as the one with EMI label (this one is less expensive).
0385344228|5.0|This well written thriller is so much better than the ordinary, run of the mill variety.<br />It is intelligent, thoughtful, and filled with great characters who know how to express<br />great depth of feeling.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This is one of the few superhero flicks I'm keeping on my shelf.  The story is good and Rogers transition from weakling to super soldier is great.
034553154X|5.0|As some of the other reviewers commented, some of it is pretty morbid, like Cersei's walk of shame, but I totally signed up for that when I bought this gorgeous thing, so. Fantastic art. A little caption at the bottom of each calendar month over what the subject is and it's book. When open, top half is the month's picture and bottom is the calendar; gorgeous centerfold (basically of the scene on the cover) that takes up both halves right in the middle.
