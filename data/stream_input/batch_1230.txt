055380684X|5.0|I've been a long time student of both the performing arts and how the human mind works.  This book combines both, with the latest science explaining the neurobiology of developing skills, and what sets the top echelon apart from the rest.  Fascinating.  I'd recommend it for all performers who aspire to excellence.
B000058983|5.0|I was turned on to this group about three years ago and have been a fan ever since.  Why they are not more well known is a mystery to me.  This CD is the type of CD where every song is great. It can be listened to from beginning to end!! I love this Band and this CD. I would also recommend their greatest hits. I have a few more but can not name them all here, all I can say is give them a listen you will not be disappointed.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Really check this out and try to get by all the images of hot topic types that may listen to this artist. This is a great creative piece of ART. This, Holywood and Mechanical Animals are three very overlooked masterpieces by many people who like great creative music but may get tuned off by the Goth posers who may also listen to it and probably have already jumped off the Manson bandwagon.
1594481717|4.0|Daniel H.Pink has done a great job explaining how being a right brainier can help you become successful in this era. The book is well-written and easy to understand. You should definitely buy this book if you're looking to capitalize on your brain creative side. I have to say my money was well spent!
B000RZGFYS|4.0|This was a bigger step for Slayer in defining their sound. This album has many themes related to death, war, horror, and the shadow side of man. And all done with a bit of tongue and cheek.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|Beautifully filmed! Talented cast, for the most part and perhaps the most self aggrandizing, pretentious, and painfully exhausted \\"father dynamic\\" story ever put on film.  A long three acts that never resolve satisfactorily and leaves the audience not bewildered by the convoluted moral message but by the affected exposition.   This is best viewed as a master's class in cinematography and a how to film on what not to do when trying to convey a story.    WJH
B003L77GHE|5.0|The interviews with the cast and producers give extra insight to the series. It's also a good thing to watch withou the digital logos in the corner.  I couldn't be more satisfied.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is about a teenage girl named Katniss Everdeen that tries to overthrow a cruel government and free her nation from the capital city's cruel grip. At the beginning, she is saved from the arena during the 75th Hunger Games and is asked by the rebel stronghold, District 13, to become the face of the rebellion against the main city also known as the Capitol. Eventually, she agrees to become the \\"Mockingjay\\" and inspire the rebels in order for them to achieve victory. She is then rushed to one of the many war fronts where she sees the Capitol destroy a rebel hospital. This unleashes her anger and allows a camera crew near her to tape an inspiring speech that helps to motivate the rebels. This helps turn the tide of the war, and gives the rebels hope that they might actually win.   Mockingjay is set in a war torn world. I myself have never been in any situation where guns or arrows have ever been used to harm other people and I hope I never am. I have also never been in a situation as large as rebelling with violence, but I can understand the feeling the rebels have of how authority can be unfair. This happens in Mockingjay when the Capitol mistreats the people in the districts by ruling over them with an iron fist. I can understand this cruelty because the Capitol is being unfair toward the people that it rules over.  I loved Mockingjay because of the suspense and action that follows Katniss through every step of her journey. Throughout the book, there were times where the suspense was so immense, that my heart started to beat faster and faster, like when she was being chased by killer, mutant lizards in a sewer. I could almost smell the stench of the sewer water, or hear the hisses of the mutants. Scenes like those just make the book wonderful and are probably one of the main reasons that I loved it and recommend it to anyone who wants a remarkable book with a bit of violence in it.  Mockingjay relates in some ways to the Eragon series. In Eragon, the characters are all trying to overthrow a dictator that is cruel to his people and has been in power for too long. Eventually, a full scale war breaks out and forces the main character, Eragon, to take a motivating role to help inspire the other soldiers. This plot shows up in Mockingjay when Katniss has to inspire rebel troops to take the Capitol and overthrow President Snow, who rules over his people with an iron fist, and has been in power since Katniss was a little kid. Both of these plots are wonderful because they have a long goal that the characters are trying to achieve throughout the book and always made me want to know how the goal is eventually reached.
0307454541|3.0|First of all, Larson is a good writer. His prose is well-done, does not get too showy, and does not interfere with his story. The plot too is good, holds your attention, and is not done at breakneck speed a la Dan Brown. I won't summarize the plot since that has been done here already.<br />Overall the book is a B+/A-.<br />What surprised me was that @ 2/3 of the way thru the story, the author introduces a Steven King-like horror chamber, which seems very out of place with the rest of his largely plausible story. I don't know why he added it, but to me it made the book a wee bit too hokey. He also leaves a few story lines unfinished...for example, what happened to Martin's wife once the \\"discovery\\" happened?  We don't know.<br />Again, overall this is a fun mystery to read, and well written.
B0055EDBIE|5.0|Not that there haven't been some great moments on Lenny's more recent albums (even Baptism, which I think most fans could agree was his least consistent work), but Black and White America is almost nothing but. It's as though all the styles and themes he's tried out finally gelled - so much so that I actually prefer Black and White America to his Greatest Hits album.<br /><br />The influences are fairly easy to pick out here - Curtis Mayfield, Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown, The Beatles, U2, etc. - but there's no doubt they're just that - influences on a work that's pure Lenny.<br /><br />I can make a case for just about any track as a favorite here, so it's simpler to say that my personal least favorite (\\"Stand\\") is a fun pop/rock tune that can hold up to the best on Baptism or It Is Time For a Love Revolution. There's a perfect balance of guitars, strings and horns on here - and a funk lean that takes what he started on 5 and pushes it up a couple levels.
B002W5GPVE|2.0|It seems a shame to rate a book based on its presentation and not its content, but in this case, the presentation was very much an obstacle to getting to the content. Yin's work on case study research is invaluable. Unfortunately, I found it very difficult to read. In the Kindle edition, errors are nearly constant. They are abysmal in the example boxes and exercises. There are words missing, sentences and phrases duplicated or cut off, and easy-to-fix typing errors everywhere. I found my reading experience halted and entirely too frustrating. I really enjoy using my Kindle, but not under such conditions. I don't know if it's Amazon or Sage, but it needs to be fixed.
0812973992|5.0|Loved,loved,loved this book. Perhaps because of the author's Irish background, the prose glides effortlessly and beautifully. This snapshot of New York on a day that is both prosaic and memorable provides many moments of grace and thoughtful reflection that will long stay with me. Like the Ghost of the Future in A Christmas Carol, we the reader know the fate that awaits the Twin Towers and the city. Yet we also see the roots of human love and interconnection that will allow New Yorkers to rise to the occasion. This book may be a lite version of Ulysses, but is well worth the read.
B000002H6Q|5.0|Dr. Feelgood is the pinnicle of Motley Crue's professional career. After several near death experiences, Nikki Sixx(herion overdose), Vince Neil(car accident), Tommy Lee(excessive drinking), and Mick Mars managed to remain sober, the band decided to lose their collective addictions(except sex,haha) and make their most profound musical statement. Thanks mostly to the help of producer Bob Rock, the band went to Little Mountain Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia and made the proverbial \\"barn burner\\" album. TNT kicks off the mayhem followed by Dr. Feelgood which features a memorable riff and solo from the greatly underrated Mick Mars. Slice Of Your Pie is about the male desire to permantly F... Up a young and impressionable female brain. Kickstart My Heart is a gem off the CD. A song about Vince Neil's love of Indy racing. Without You is the love song of the album, Motely's highest chart topper to date, clocking in at #6 on the Billboard Charts. In addition, it has some very tasteful slide guitar by Mars. Same Ol' Situation is an adventure into threesomes and lesbian romance. She Goes Down is, well ya know, haha. Don't Go Away Mad(Just Go Away) is the most fun track on the album, and has a great bridge and solo section. Time For Change was the band reflecting on where they were and where they've been. The sound of the record is also a stand out, this album is a must have!
B004JMY312|5.0|Does this movie have silly moments of Disney cheese, layered on with a trowel?  Absolutely.  It's part of the charm.  Bette has said she considers this one of her best on-screen performances, and it's hard to disagree.  She plays the head witch character perfect, with a great supporting cast providing the ideal canvas to play off of.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite completly changed the metal/hard rock landscape in late 87'. The album represented a change from the usual million note lead playing of Eddie wannabes to the austere styles of late 60's early 70's Jimmy Page and Joe Walsh. W. Axl Rose was the puppetmaster of this juggernaut. He had a brillant lead guitar player in Slash, Izzy Stradlin handeled the chords, and Duff McKagan(bass) and Steven Adler(drums) provided the foundation. The CD starts out with Welcome to the Jungle, a rollicking track where Rose points out the debauchery and hypocrisy of the Sunset Strip. Mr. Brownstone is a song about Herion addiction and the havoc it causes people. Paradise City is probably the most memorable and successful track of the album. The song slowly builds in intensity to climax with a flurry of kick-ass guitar riffs. My Michelle comments on the problems of having F...Up parents, who are addicted to drugs and alcohol and the nightmare this causes their children. I Think About You is a song about love in the fast lane which frequently comes up short. Sweet Child O'Mine has an instantly recognizable intro and some refined and emotional guitar work by Slash. You're Crazy is Axl's stiff and erect middle finger to his critics, he continued this theme on Get In The Ring from Use Your Illusion II. Rockett Queen is probably my favorite track on the CD. I have vivid memories of driving my friends car into the middle of his woods, cranking up his radio and drinking till we all passed out. This album is arguably the best record of the 1980's and without question one of the top 5 metal albums of all time. If you don't own a copy get one!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This would be on my list of top five favorite books.  They way the author writes this book and ties it all together takes it to another level.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|A highly addicting game! This is a cute little game to pass the time. It has small achievements that you can go to unlock more features like different swards and backgrounds.
0810989956|5.0|This is the book that my grandson asked for his 9th birthday present. It was the only thing he wanted. This is a boy who in into building and taking apart things, but when he saw this book it was what he had to have. Now my 15year old grandson wants one too. What a great book.
1416550550|5.0|Kate Morton is a wonderful storyteller. This book was a great read! Though a storyline or two were predictable, this book was quite enjoyable, full of mystery, with well-developed characters.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I missed the series when they were on originally, so started watching reruns and decided that because they touched on every possible subject that it was a great way to find out about a lot of sexual ideas and their take on them....it was like going to \\"sex school\\"....funny, interesting, and just plain entertaining...I also bought the 2 movies.....
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Everything is great, typing speed has never been better, however gets a little boring with only 3 themes. Please add more themes!
0756655307|5.0|I had my eyes on this book after a visit to a Books-a-Million, which listed a price tag of $40.  After discovering it on Amazon at just $22, I'd say this is a great buy for any Marvel fan.  Great resource for anyone looking to brush up on their knowledge of Marvel's vast character list.  Especially helpful for relatively newcomers to the comic book scene.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Basic summary: Clary finds out she can see demon-hunting people called Shadowhunters and discovers she's more tangled in their world than she thought. she likes a Shadowhunter, JAce, who is perfect. He was also abused and is 'broken' and can't love. Commence clicheness. But it is a good story.    So. Good or bad first? I guess bad. I do realy love this book. But It happens to be similar to the Harry Potter series which might turn people off. Clary's pretty normal and then finds out she's special. Really, people like to read that stuff because everyone wants to believe that one day they'll find out that they're a wizard or (spoiler)that their mother has magical powers that you inherited. Including me. There's also latin in it like Harry potter. The beginning moves a little slow, but pull through! I think it's worth a read. Some things that annoyed me: (spoiler) love triangle, predictable turns and characters sounding twice their age.     The love triangle. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy reading them too. Vampire Academy is my favorite series in the world and Bloodlines is sitting on my shelf waiting for me to read it. The love triangle in that book is fantastic but thats all I'll say about that, I don't want to turn this into a review for that. The love triangle in MI (Mortal Instruments) is...cliched. The girl has a boy best friend (which, by the way, hardly ever happens in real life) and has no idea he's falling for her. SPOILER:::::She explores both relationships and the best friend loses in the race for her love. I had no idea that would happen. :P     Predictable turns? Lots of them. She couldn't just have been a plain old teenager forever, she had to be 'special'. Of course Valentine was her father, and the big surprise at the end wasn't very surprising. Also, Clary sometimes reflects the author's...adultness. She has thoughts that are more fitting for a thirty year old. Also, actions that most teens wouldn't think to do. But she's still lovable :)    For the good part! I know I made it sound so bad, but all in all it is a good book. I love the idea of Shadowhunters, and that Clary isn't just a sit back and let the boy rescue you heroine. She fights, and strives to be just as good as the other shadowhunters who have way more experience. The characters are well developed, and you feel like you're right there with them. You can get sucked into this book for hours and finish it in a sitting. After you finish it, you will dream about it. You better have City of Ashes on hand because you will be dyinggg to read it. And the drama and love...all that stuff makes you feel good. How sweet Jace can be, even though the last thing he wants to do is fall in love.  He's broken, and of course, everyone wants to fix him.     Even though it's not my favorite book, I still give it four stars because of the good story and characters. For an even better read, go check out Cassandra Clare's Clockwork Angel.
B0048LPRD2|5.0|This is my original review upon first seeing this film:<br /><br />I saw this movie 1 time and I'm not sure I want to see it again. Just when you think a director's a genius, bam. Enter the Void proves that Noe is definitely human. This movie, if you want to call it that, is dull, has flat characters, too long, too slow, and just too much of everything bad. Everyone here who likes the film talk about its cinematography but I thought I was buying a film with a plot, a narrative, and not just an excuse to show off a bunch of silly camera tricks. Every shot lingers as if to say \\"look at me. Don't I look cool?\\" Nothing wrong with being artistic but in film art should augment and not replace the story.<br /><br />This is a shame because I expected so much from Noe after Irreversible. The talent's definitely there in this film but it seems so conscious of itself, so narcissistic, and ultimately, so gaudy that it's actually a turn off. If you're looking for a visual narrative check out Koyaanisquatsi or Antonio Gaudi. Pass on this one.<br /><br />And this is my 2nd review after seeing it again recently:<br /><br />Some films are simply so far ahead of their time that they simply can't be completely appreciated on 1 viewing. I am going to say this without equivocating and with all humility: this film has replaced 2001: A Space Odyssey as my all time favorite trip-out film. That's right, I take back everything I said against this film in my former review. I guess after seeing Irreversible and being blown away by it, I was expecting something similarly shocking. This film is an entirely different animal than the previous films in that it's trippier and, in its own ugly perverse way, more beautiful than his previous films.<br /><br />Basically, the film's an odyssey of reincarnation and the afterlife told through the eyes of the main character who's a drug dealer who happens to get caught at the wrong place (Tokyo) at the wrong time with dope, a psychedelic drug called DMT. This is one of those movies you have to see twice, once to be be introduced to it, and a second time after it's taken root in your subconscious. It is something about the whole experience of this film that sets it apart from other films, much the same as what separates 2001 from other sci fi films. There's a plot but it's buried in the experience, the beauty, the horror of the images in this film, unconscious, you can't see it but you know it's there, like air, all around you. This is definitely a love or hate film. Noe outdid himself. This film will be talked about for years to come. Like I said, it's not about the story as much as it's about what you see, hear, and feel on the screen. Incredible film! Not for the squeamish.nce to be be introduced to it, and a second time after it's taken root in your subconscious.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|I'll cut right to the chase and tell you what I think of all 16 songs:    1) What You Want  When I first heard the \\"Do what you what you want\\" part I admit my initial reaction was 'WTF'? After hearing it a few times it didn't phase me as much, especially since the rest of the song made up for it. I like that it's different from what they normally do. It's catchy, fun to jump to, and it has an awesome message: Don't be afraid to do what you want. My favorite part is the bridge, particularly the last part (Down, down, down, down).    2) Made of Stone  Dark, heavy, and beautiful; just the way an Evanescence song should be. Amy's voice is strong in this one. Once again the bridge is my favorite part; starts with a beautiful piano melody along with Amy singing and continues with the heaviness. Awesome.    3) The Change  Blown away by the chorus. The bass during the verses is pretty catchy as well. Good song.    4) My Heart is Broken  My jaw literally dropped within the first 30 seconds of this song. The piano, the vocals, the drums, EVERYTHING about this song is pure awesomeness. Amy herself said that she hopes this one becomes a single. I strongly agree.    5) The Other Side  Catchy melody for the verses. I love the end of the bridge where it's just the piano and vocals. The last chorus is awesome.    6) Erase This  Again, the verses have a catchy melody. Not the worst song on the album but nothing really memorable about it to me.    7) Lost in Paradise  BEAUTIFUL song. You can hear pain in Amy's voice which can almost bring a tear to your eye. Love it. Almost has the same feel as 'Lithium', my favorite Evanescence song.    8) Sick  The first verse has an awesome guitar riff which the second verse sadly lacks. It could've done without the first part of the third chorus being distorted; would've been better if she just sang softly at that part. Not a bad song, though.    9) End of the Dream  Love the chorus. The lyrics for the bridge are good: \\"Why must we fall apart tolearn how to fly? I will find a way, even without wings\\". However, it could've been done better.    10) Oceans  The guitars are awesome in this one. Other than that this one didn't stick out to me as much.    11) Never Go Back  This song was inspired by the tsunami in Japan. It's awesome that Amy put herself in that situation with this song. The bass during the verses is sick. Actually you know what? This whole song is sick. Most definitely iPod worthy.    12) Swimming Home  Sounds like something from the 1999-2000 era. Once again, Amy's voice is soft and gorgeous. This is the first song during which I noticed some harp in the background. I admit I hated this song at first but after listening to it a couple of times it began to grow on me a little. Not something I'd put on repeat but it's a good song to listen to if you just wanna relax.    13) New Way to Bleed  Pretty catchy I suppose. Other than the bridge which has some nice harp, nothing really memorable about this one IMO.    14) Say You Will  Love this one! This song speaks for everyone who's ever had a crush/lover who's giving mixed signals. And it's fun to jump to!    15) Disappear  Really catchy chorus. Lyrics are good and guitars are nice and heavy just how I like it.    16) Secret Door  Another beauty! Wanna drift off to sleep? Put this song on and let the harp, orchestra, and Amy's voice do the job. It helps that this song is about dreaming. I LOVE it.    IMO, none of these songs top 'Lithium' off The Open Door. However, 'My Heart Is Broken', 'Never Go Back', 'The Change', 'Lost In Paradise', and 'Secret Door' are close seconds.    As for the DVD...take a look at the behind the scenes footage of the video for 'What You Want'. When they show the fans, look for a skinny black girl with glasses wearing black arm warmers. THAT'S ME!!!! I swear on my life. Don't believe me? Watch this: [...]    In conclusion, this album should be in the hands of every human being of every country. That is all. Thanks for reading!
B0034G4P80|1.0|This film was lousy from the get go, by the numbers, formulaic, big, dumb, loud, Shakespearean, big budget, blond, big muscles, big hammer, duh!<br /><br />I'm getting tired of superhero films. When i was a kid I always wanted to see my favorite comic books on screen. Now, I wish they would all just go away. They're all the same.When I saw the ice creatures and Anthony Hopkins with his throw in \\"Lord of the Ringish\\" accent as Odin, combined with the \\"thees\\", \\"thous\\", and \\"nays\\" I knew this would be no more than an excuse to show how something this juvenile and superficial would look in 3d.<br /><br />Thor, himself, is about as hulking and juvenile as Dom in Fast and the Furious, i.e. he exists only to show his big muscles and to fight and to look cool doing it. The first hour of the film is supposed to set up the romance between the Asgardian Thor--whose father emasculated him and banished to Earth--and Natalie Portman who's supposed to be a storm chaser or something, I don't remember. After an hour of getting to know Thor as a human being, he recovers his lost hammer and becomes the god of thunder again and defeats the enemy. Would like to say more about the movie but that's it, sorry. A complete waste of money. Rent only if there's nothing else in the store.
B00151G08Y|3.0|It was the swizzy sounds, fast and energetic breakbeats, mariachi trumpets and Rob Swire's distinct voice that created the infectious tune \\"Propane Nightmares\\" that attracted me to Pendulum. I had only been into one DnB group before- the Canadian indie/rock/DnB duo USS (Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker), whose album [[ASIN:B001V5SBOU Questamation]] has my vote as one of the greatest debuts of the past decade, and one of the most promising. I would definitely recommend the download, as it is very different then most DnB and music in general.<br /><br />I remember when I bought Immersion. I went to the store looking for this album, and they didn't have any copies... Thankfully. I do remember having found Immersion, and willing to give any of their stuff a try, I picked it up- probably the best blind buy I ever made. Having heard no tracks and no expectations for a Propane Nightmares 2 (even the cover art was an indication it would be different sounding), and I loved every single track on it.<br /><br />This album, which I got a couple months later, is an album I'm glad I didn't start listening to Pendulum with. While it isn't a bad album, it's not as accessible as the aforementioned Immersion or their sizzling hot debut Hold Your Colour. In fact, I'd recommend starting with either of the two, preferably Immersion. Both albums are amazing, Ansolutely pine chillingly awesome exercises in DnB.<br /><br />SHOWDOWN: 5/10: I'm a bit indifferent about this track, to be perfectly honest. I think it's an awesome opener, but weak as a standalone track. When it started, something seemed quite different, even to me, who got into them through Immersion. However once it's smoking hot bassline kicked in, that's when I started grooving. However, in the middle of the track it does lose the middle ground and the rather cringe worthy \\"Heere we goooo agaaaaaiiinnn\\" just ruins the tune, and the track overall succumbs to being repetitive. Just so much more could have been done. If anything, maybe it would be improved if the dreamy \\"Star Wipe\\" intro that was apparently dropped for no reason preceded. I've heard it and it's an excellent intro!<br /><br />DIFFERENT: 9/10: Wow, one of the few Pendulum tracks which uses the title in its lyrics.that said, excellent tune. It has a bit of an Origin of Symmetry era Muse sound to it, Swire even uses a Bellamy-esque falsetto in two parts. However, it gets a point docked off for starting to lose energy near the end, but it's a fun track all around.<br /><br />PROPANE NIGHTMARES: 10/10: like I mentioned, this track is why I got into Pendulum. It's Mexican feel and catchy beat just have \\"instant hit\\" written all over it. \\"Bring it all home\\" is exactly what this track does [/lame pun]. Definitely a track I'd recommend downloading if you are hoping to listen to one song to get into them.<br /><br />VISIONS: 4/10: This songs intro is instant \\"on repeat\\" bait for me. \\"Change your visions, give us a sign, tune your your ears to the grind, lost your mind and out of control, I'm gonna be a f---ing superstar,\\" excellent bang-ish opening lyrics. I also love the synth craziness that follows. However, the song doesn't seem to grow past that, when the beat kicks in, it stays on the same boring note and 98% of the song is sung through a damned vocoder, to the point where all the lyrics are practically incomprehensible. And the music does have a few hints that things are about to get better... Unfortunately those hints are all we get.<br /><br />MIDNIGHT RUNNER: 7/10: Here's a song that could have been a meandering, bore. The first 2:36 of this song are a soft, boring intro with Swire whining inaudibly and incomprehensibly through a vocoder (I haven't bothered to look up the lyrics, but I kinda don't want to). However, after 2:36 minutes, suddenly an AWESOME and energetic part kicks in and shows promise of an awesome tune, and thankfully lives up to it. There's a false ending near the end, but then it fades in, and an awesome synth riff fades in, and Swire go Vocodes an INCREDIBLE high note, which lasts through the whole rest of the track and is emulated through a guitar.<br /><br />THE OTHER SIDE: 6/10: This isn't a bad song. It's actually quite catchy and some good mindless fun. I'm thinking if you're in the right mood this song will work, however only if you're in the right mood. Also, put it on Immersion and I probably would have hit the skip button.<br /><br />MUTINY: 4/10: This song is awesomely heavy but I feel it just seems like filler, like it was just thrown in the album to pad it out. Nothing too much going on here.<br /><br />9,000 MILES: 6/10 This song is quite similar to Midnight Runner, at least to me. How it finds itself rather boring to begin with and takes a bit too long to get going. When Rob Swire sings the sings the first two lines, the song starts to get interesting and I like the middle eastern feel it begins to take kn from this point, however, It isn't as interesting as Midnight Runner. Also, someone please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks of Vegeta when I hear this song (\\"It's over NIIIIIINE THOOOOOOOUUUSSSAAAAAANNNDDDDDD!!!!!!\\")... Swire even sings it like Vegeta!!!<br /><br />GRANITE: 1/10 Silly lyrics and boring. One of the few tracks I've omitted from being transferred to my iPod when putting an album on.<br /><br />THE TEMPEST: 10/10: Simply put, the best track Of the lot. It has a bit of a Jane's Addiction feel to it for sure, with the driving riff and mid tempo beat for the first 5 minutes. I love the use of strings in this track too. I'd say this is a rockier version of \\"Encoder\\", as it even has similar lyrical content. It even has their trademark \\"false ending\\", which fades in for two more minutes of epic rock.<br /><br />In short, I guess I kinda Have a love and hate relationship with this album. I'll admit every time I listen, I find things about it that I like, and it has grown on me, but unlike the albums it's sandwiched in between, it isnt a front to back album. I'd recommend buying the said albums you're hoping to get into the band... Then this.s through the whole rest of the track and is emulated through a guitar.   THE OTHER SIDE: 6/10: This isn't a bad song. It's actually quite catchy and some good mindless fun. I'm thinking if you're in the right mood this song will work, however only if you're in the right mood. Also, put it on Immersion and I probably would have hit the skip button.  MUTINY: 4/10: This song is awesomely heavy but I feel it just seems like filler, like it was just thrown in the album to pad it out. Nothing too much going on here.   9,000 MILES: 6/10 This song is quite similar to Midnight Runner, at least to me. How it finds itself rather boring to begin with and takes a bit too long to get going. When Rob Swire sings the sings the first two lines, the song starts to get interesting and I like the middle eastern feel it begins to take kn from this point, however, It isn't as interesting as Midnight Runner. Also, someone please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks of Vegeta when I hear this song (\\"It's over NIIIIIINE THOOOOOOOUUUSSSAAAAAANNNDDDDDD!!!!!!\\")... Swire even sings it like Vegeta!!!  GRANITE: 1/10 Silly lyrics and boring. One of the few tracks I've omitted from being transferred to my iPod when putting an album on.  THE TEMPEST: 10/10: Simply put, the best track Of the lot. It has a bit of a Jane's Addiction feel to it for sure, with the driving riff and mid tempo beat for the first 5 minutes. I love the use of strings in this track too. I'd say this is a rockier version of \\"Encoder\\", as it even has similar lyrical content. It even has their trademark \\"false ending\\", which fades in for two more minutes of epic rock.  In short, I guess I kinda Have a love and hate relationship with this album. I'll admit every time I listen, I find things about it that I like, and it has grown on me, but unlike the albums it's sandwiched in between, it isnt a front to back album. I'd recommend buying the said albums you're hoping to get into the band... Then this.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I loved the first three films (IV-VI), but the prequels absolutely atrocious. And blu-ray does them no favors. Absolute garbage film(green-screen)making. I should have just bought the original pack and not this Complete Saga version.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I want to live inside Thea Harrison's mind. No kidding! If she could just write me into this world and give me a big, hulking, alpha hero like Dragos, I'd be a real happy girl.<br /><br />Read this book. Don't diddle around expecting to hear it isn't worth the hype. I'm telling you - as a former skeptic - it is! Pia Giovanni is the kind of heroine I love. Smart, strong, quick-humored, and capable of rational-thinking. Her inner-dialogue had me snickering nearly as much as her witty banter. Pia is no misguided heroine, even though she's made a few mistakes. She handles Dragos and his instincts almost effortlessly. They clash on his overbearing ways more than once, but she's smart enough to know he means well. She isn't afraid to correct his behavior or tell him he's wrong. And the best part is, he's man - or beast - enough to take it!<br /><br />Dragos has lived for centuries and has never known love. For all his many capabilities, he's sweetly clueless. First he's smitten by this woman who has the nerve to steal from his horde! Then, he falls for her hook, line, and sinker. He has no idea what he's feeling - except that he never wants her to leave him, and he knows he must protect her no matter what.<br /><br />Dragon Bound is a fun adventure through a modern world where mystical creatures live naturally among humankind. The characters, the magic, the action, the mystery, the excitement of falling in love - it's all found within these pages. This journey with the Elder Races is one I can't wait to continue on. Next up, Storm's Heart with Tricks and Tiago!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have all of J.G.'s CDs except Noel. I was blown away by the beauty and messages here.The only language that I speak is English, but with this CD when I hear other languages I walk around singing them as well as I can. I never did this before. Regardless of other reviews, he belts out all of the voice that he always has. This one is just put together incredibly well. I would pay double the price of the CD just to get Galileo and Higher Window. The idea of putting a link to a special performance of his (only for those who by the entire CD) shows again how he is generous to his fans. You get it all and more here. I was surprised that he didn't have 5 stars across the board. I'm no expert about picking pieces of music apart, however, I'll leave you with this: When a U.S. Supreme Ct. Justice was asked how he determines pornography he said \\" I'll know it when I see it.\\"  Well, I know it when I hear it. My CD is set to play on repeat and I have to remember to stop it at times so that it doesn't get too hot. I can't praise it enough.
0385534639|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this book prior to reading it but I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by it.  The themes in this book are wonderful and the book is truly fun to read.  Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down, it is a very engaging read.  The characters, while probably not as fleshed out as they could have been, are interesting and add their own spice to the Night Circus.  While the circus itself acts as the setting it is also the main attracation of the novel, almost becoming a character itself in a lot of ways.  This was not the most intellectual read but it does stir the imagination and engage the senses.  If I have complaint about this book it is that the novel is far too short.  I could have done with a couple hundred more pages on some of the more interesting sub-plots.  I know that the main focus of this story is on Celia and Marco, but I honestly enjoyed Bailey's story a bit more.    At any rate fans of movies such as The Illusionist and The Prestige should find this book enjoyable while fans of Harry Potter and Twilight not so much.  Magic in this book is not used in the same manner as the magic used in the HP series, it is used in a far more meaningful and poetic manner.  There is no great deal of action in this novel, but what it lacks in action it more than makes up for in imagery and sensual wonderment.  Happy reading!
B005HZXUSM|5.0|From the liner notes:<br /><br />\\"This album was inspired by and is dedicated to the many, often nameless visionaries, idealists, and designers of the early 20th Century, who saw and gave shape to a future, where design combined beauty, aesthetic and utility, a future that included everyone, but was sadly, a future that was never to be.\\"<br /><br />I don't know how I can review this album without comparing it to 2002's Futureperfect.  Both albums are a bit more melodic than usual for VNV; both feature a hauntingly beautiful, neoclassical track (Liebestod, Goodbye 20th Century); and both feature songs that try to evoke visions of futuristic cities (Airships, Streamline).<br /><br />So it would be very easy to accuse Automatic of being nothing more than \\"Futureperfect Revisited.\\"  But that comparison is too simplistic.<br /><br />Futureperfect treats the future as the present:  it's about (as I interpret it) already being IN a future that didn't quite turn out as advertised.  And so a lot of songs on Futureperfect tend to be about what's wrong with the future, AS PRESENT.  \\"No tears, no sympathy\\"; \\"Somehow I'm always falling over me\\"; \\"By our blindness and stupidity, we kill everything\\"; \\"Did we toil in vain in hope that wisdom came from what we've done\\"; \\"Tell me what ritual I should have today\\"; \\"Circumstances afford me no second chance to tell you how much I've missed you\\"; \\"Now I'm leaving home, leaving everything that I have ever known.\\"  Even some of the more anthemic tracks on Futureperfect (Genesis, Airships, Fearless) seem to have a note of hopelessness about them.  And yet, Futureperfect somehow ends up being the happier album.<br /><br />And you wouldn't guess that by strictly scanning the lyrics, or even hearing one of the more anthemic tracks all by itself.  For instance, take Streamline.  It manages something rare:  being a bright, up-tempo, hands in the air dance anthem that can reduce you to tears of regret.  It's not that there's anything inherently sad about, say, \\"Streamlined simplicity, the renaissance of humanity, avenues of light to guide us home.\\"  But when you listen to the song with the concept in mind--that this could have been the future, OUR PRESENT, but yet it never came to pass--then the optimistic lyrics, and even the bright, up-tempo music, suddenly become a heartbreaking catalog of the happiness that now, we'll never experience.  It takes considerable artistry to make a song both uplifting and depressing at the same time, but VNV absolutely nails it with that one track.<br /><br />I don't want to leave the impression that this album is a total downer:  tracks like Resolution and Gratitude do keep the overall tenor of the album one that's more happy than not.  But there are a couple of tracks where you might want to have some Kleenex handy the first time you listen to them.<br /><br />And then, there's Nova, which is worth the price of admission all by itself.  VNV has not been shy about touching on spiritual and religious themes (Genesis, Nemesis, As It Fades, Where There Is Light), but Nova may be the most overtly spiritual song they've ever done.  It is nothing short of transcendent, and it is very quickly becoming one of my favorite songs of all time.<br /><br />VNV came up with a terrific concept, and they keep it going all the way through the album.

B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie was amazing!  I saw it in the theatre shortly after it's release.  My then fiance (now wife) wanted to go and see it too after we had started dating, and I had no problem with that because I loved it so much!  The Marvel franchise of movies overall are like I dream come true!  I use to read a lot of comics when I was younger, and still do, and when I was younger I had always thought it would be cool if they one day broght these awesome superheroes to life in some movies, and I think it's so cool that they have the technology now to do them.  A good buddy of mine in Hawaii sent this to me on Blu-Ray as a birthday gift.  Super awesome!  So stoked for Avengers in 2012!
1401207529|5.0|During the 1980s there was a real attempt in the comic book industry to cater to the interests, maturity, and cynicism of adults rather than to the naivete, innocence, and adventurous spirit of children. Many classic comic book superheroes were resurrected into the world of the '80s and given very grim contemporary story lines to make them more realistic and compelling. Perhaps one of the most compelling of these story lines is that written by Frank Miller. In the late '70s and into the early '80s, Miller had made a real name for himself while working at both Marvel and DC, and his revitalization of the Daredevil and Punisher characters for Marvel Comics had proven to be a major success with fans and critics. But perhaps Miller's greatest achievement in comics came when he created two very different and very dark depictions of Batman for DC Comics.  In the now legendary [[ASIN:1563893428 \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns\\"]], Miller turned Batman into a Dirty Harry-like vigilante, whose brutal methods were only matched by the brutality of the crumbling futuristic Gotham that he lived in. The book was somewhat controversial as it changed or rather embellished certain characteristics of the Batman and pushed the envelope as to the amount of violence and killing that could occur within mainstream superhero comics. Personally, I have not read this particular Batman tale since I don't care for some of Miller's overly authoritarian depictions of heroism, but I will admit that the man is a great talent, as both a writer and an artist, and that his macho-noir vision was groundbreaking in the comic book medium.  For me, Frank Miller's shining moment of creative genius came when he revisited Batman's past and how it was that he came to be the Dark Knight of Gotham City that we all know and love. As mentioned earlier, DC Comics wanted to update their characters by retelling their origin stories with a new level of depth and complexity in order to attract more intelligent and sophisticated readers. To do this, they often challenged the idealized version of the superhero which had been so prevalent in the past by placing them in corrupt societies where their methods of enforcing order became increasingly harsh and their morality began to wane. When writer/editor Denny O'Neil (who had, along with editor Julius Schwartz and artists Dick Giordano and Neal Adams, reinvented many of DC Comics' great characters during the late '60s and '70s) asked some of the writers and artists at DC who would be interested in tackling Batman in a realistic and psychologically grounded story that would explore the character's past, it became clear that the job would have to go to a collaborative team that knew how to deal with the character.  Enter Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli.  In \\"Batman: Year One\\", which was originally published as a four-issue miniseries in 1987 before being collected into a bestselling graphic novel, Frank Miller told readers a tale of how Bruce Wayne became Batman in a way that was ultimately definitive. In terms of character origins, the story emphasized the psychology of the protagonists, Bruce Wayne and Jim Gordon, and showed them as truly heroic albeit sometimes flawed figures. Miller took what had come before in comics and elaborated on it and in doing so established a new version of the Batman mythos which has been an inspiration and influence to almost every writer who has set out to tell a Batman story since.  David Mazzucchelli had been a talented artist with a very unique visual sense. Hand-picked by Miller, Mazzucchelli created a stunning depiction of Gotham replete with gothic settings, film noir atmosphere, and stark contrasts between light and shadows, monochrome and color. Mazzucchelli modeled his version of Bruce Wayne on young Gregory Peck and Jim Gordon is reminiscent of many of the iconic hard-boiled police and detective characters found in illustrated pulp magazines of the '30s and '40s. The cityscape of Gotham isa strangely believable combination of modern New York with a distinctly retro-noir look to it.  What sets \\"Year One\\" apart from other Batman stories is the way that it so efficiently juxtaposes Bruce Wayne's journey into becoming Batman with Jim Gordon's rise in the Gotham City Police Department as one of the few honest cops amidst all the corruption. I really love the fact that as much time is spent with Bruce Wayne/Batman as is spent learning about Gordon, who had up until this point never really been given the focus that he deserved as a character. The story itself is also unique since it doesn't rely on Batman's colorful enemies to flesh it out or engage readers. Selina Kyle, also known as the femme fatale Catwoman, is given an introduction as prostitute who turns to cat burglary and the last page of the comic introduces the Joker as a new threat to the citizens of Gotham, but all in all, there are no supervillains. This more down to earth approach allows for Miller to display Wayne's evolution as Batman and to show him learning how to apply his keen intelligence, martial arts training, and detective skills to costumed crime-fighting. Without the presence of theatrical megalomaniac villains, the focus returns to corrupt politicians and police officers, to street-level crime and poverty, which really shows the social crusader aspects of the Batman and Gordon characters brilliantly. My only complaint as far as the writing goes is that the Alfred character is so under-utilized and is left merely to make dry humorous comments and that Selina Kyle's appearances are so few. However, these are very minor qualms with what is truly a masterpiece of superhero fiction!  All in all, \\"Batman: Year One\\" is perhaps the best Batman graphic novel ever written in that it so carefully adheres to the moody detective roots of the character created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, while injecting the world of Gotham City with a vitality that was both refreshingly modern and yet timeless. Of all Frank Miller's work, this manages to stand out in my memory as his most intelligently scripted, most dynamically drawn, and most memorably heroic.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I saw this in the theatre with my now wife, and we bothed loved it!  I thought it was very well done!  This is a definite must own for sure!  Words cannot even describe how excited I am about the upcoming Avengers film next year, and about every single one of the Marvel titles leading up to it!  So awesome!
0930289234|5.0|First let me begin this review by saying that there are very few contemporary writers that I truly admire and respect for their artistic integrity and uncompromising ideas. And let me also inform you that there are not many books in recent years that I would call essential... but the graphic novel \\"Watchmen\\" by  Alan Moore is a mesmerizing exception.<br /><br />I first came across the book when I was in summer camp and I was about thirteen-years old. At the time I was heavily into reading a bizarre combination of Greek myths, fantasy novels, comic books, and Shakespearean plays (mainly the tragedies). I suffered under the pretension that I was an intellectual because most of my peers were reading quaint young adult novels about adolescent romances and school troubles, while I was reading poetry, philosophy, and wanting to become a professional writer. Then I encountered a fellow camper with similar tastes and, dare I say, an even bleaker outlook on life than my own. It was this angry, self-doubting, pubescent punk that introduced me to  Alan Moore's classic 12-part series \\"Watchmen\\"... and I've never looked at comic books the same way again.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is an amazing, epic series that commenced in 1986 and was published by the legendary  DC Comics. DC is best known for a trio of classic comic book heroes that were created in the late 1930s and early `40s. Superman,  Batman, and  Wonder Woman are still a popular staple in the \\"DC Universe\\", mainly because they can evolve and adapt to better reflect the current social atmosphere.<br /><br />In the early 1960s, DC revived many of their best-selling characters in a series of slightly more sophisticated updates of their classic `40s comics. Meanwhile  Marvel Comics, at the time a hipper, edgier company, found great success with their new take on superheroes. As  Marvel began creating a cosmology of self-centered, morally conflicted, and neurotic characters, DC suffered from \\"Batmania\\". With the popularity of the ridiculously campy and self-satirizing  Batman series, starring  Adam West and  Burt Ward, on the rise  DC found itself losing readers. While  Marvel's characters were tackling sociopolitical and even spiritual issues spawned by the tragedies of the Vietnam War,  DC was being denigrated by their reputation as a simple, old-fashioned publisher of children's cartoons. But that changed when a group of socially conscious writers, artists, and editors came on board and began breathing new life into  DC's superhero pantheon. An era began of more topical comics, where people had no qualms with dealing with controversial issues. Civil rights, anti-war, and even anti-government stories began to proliferate at both  DC and  Marvel.<br /><br />By the early 1970s writers began to take notice that the average reader was no longer a five to ten-year old. College kids had discovered the new complexity of the comic book. The world of comics had entered a new age, where posters of superheroes were proudly hung upon the walls of student dormitories next to pictures of revolutionary figures like  Malcolm X and  Che Guevara. Comics were becoming part of the counterculture and paradoxically they also became more commercial than ever before.<br /><br />Yet as tastes evolved and the hippie mentality of a \\"revolution of love\\" faded away, a new group of writers and artists emerged to remind the world that life wasn't all sunshine and flowers. The `70s were coming to an end, faith in the American government was dissipated after the deception and distrust of the Nixon years, and the consumerism and Cold War paranoia of the `80s were just around the bend.  It was in this decade of decadence and denial, of great artistic innovation and technological advancement that comics were forced to grow up... whether readers were ready to or not.<br /><br />Just as there had been an \\"invasion\\" of British innovators in the rock 'n' roll music of the `60s, a similar \\"invasion\\" began happening in the comicbook industry. European writers and artists were dealing with a wide range of social, political, economic, and religious problems within their ever-increasingly conservative cultures. Inspired by the rebellious attitude of punk rock and the writing of the beat poets and the hippies, some comic book creators began telling stories of dystopian futures that reflected their growing concerns with modern society. As these darkly pessimistic books began to gain in popularity,  DC Comics executives sat up and took notice. They began importing talented British writers and artists to the U.S., and here they began to reawaken the spirit of social activism that had been so prominent during the Vietnam era.<br /><br />Among the many talented writers who made names for themselves were two innovators : Alan Moore, who specialized in anarchic storytelling with a distinctly philosophical slant and  Neil Gaiman, whose darkly humorous tales are often tinged with mystical themes. Both of these writers, along with many others, would inspire and influence their contemporaries, as well as future generations of comic book and graphic novel fans.<br /><br />As I have said earlier, whether readers were ready for it or not, comics were about to leave behind their domain as a medium for children and enter the cruel world of the adult. And it was  Alan Moore's masterpiece \\"Watchmen\\" that would be responsible for this momentous change.<br /><br /> \\"At midnight, all the agents and superhuman crew, go out and round up everyone who knows more than they do.\\"<br />-Bob Dylan in the song Desolation Row<br /><br />The world of the Watchmen is set in a hellish alternate 1985, where Nixon is still President of the United States of America. In this alternate reality superheroes (or more accurately, costumed vigilantes) are not uncommon, though the government has outlawed them. But their existence is not purely beneficial and they are typically as dysfunctional, if not more so, than average citizens are. As the tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union grow to an unbearable level, a sociopath masked crime-fighter named Rorschach begins his own investigation into the murder of a fellow superhero (who was less than super as you will find out when you read the book) known as The Comedian. Rorschach's instincts tell him that the death of The Comedian is no random incident and he suspects an elaborate conspiracy against all heroes, but who if anyone is behind it?<br /><br />\\"Shall not the Judge of the earth do right?\\"<br />-Genesis 18:25<br /><br />While Rorschach stalks the streets of New York looking for answers, his former allies reminisce about their glory days as superheroes, before the government outlawed their brand of vigilante justice. Former heroes Nite Owl (a man named Hollis Mason was the first Nite Owl), a self-doubting and apathetic man whose real identity is Dan Dreiberg, and Silk Spectre (her mother was the first Silk Spectre), whose real identity is Laurie Juspeczyk, begin to question if their abilities as heroes are once again needed. As Laurie spends more time with Dan, she and her former boyfriend (if you can even call him that) Dr. Manhattan become more distant.<br /><br />\\"Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.\\"<br />-Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan, formerly known as Jon Osterman, became the first superhuman superhero when, as a brilliant young science student, he was accidentally trapped inside of an intrinsic field test chamber and was de-atomized. Yet somehow Osterman's consciousness survived and he psychically manifests a new body for himself. Osterman now possesses the god-like ability to manipulate all matter, constructing or destructing whatever he chooses. Osterman's powers make him an international celebrity, a status to which he is ambivalent, and he is employed by the U.S. government to fight the Communists during the Vietnam War. But Osterman, now dubbed Dr. Manhattan (named after the Manhattan Project), becomes more and more detached emotionally, until finally he begins to disassociate himself from all of humanity.<br /><br />\\"On Hallowe'en the old ghosts come about us, and they speak to some; to others they are dumb.\\"<br />-Eleanor Farjeon in the poem Hallowe'en<br /><br />Meanwhile Rorschach continues his vigilant quest, all the while society falls apart around him, reinforcing his fanatical apocalyptic religious beliefs.<br /><br />Former superhero Ozymandias, a.k.a. Adrian Veidt, now an egotistical entrepeneur, who exploits his own celebrity for financial and political gain, is said to be one of the most intelligent men alive. So, naturally Rorschach distrusts him, as well as former hero Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, who vocally expressed his dislike of the violent and morally deviant Comedian.<br /><br />\\"It would be a stronger world, a stronger loving world, to die in.\\"<br />-John Cale in the song Santies<br /><br />But as Rorschach and the other heroes come closer to the truth, as the mystery of The Comedian's death unfolds, it becomes grossly apparent that the \\"Watchmen\\" and their superhero fraternity was comprised of severely flawed individuals: rapists, murderers, racists, psychopaths, and opportunists.<br /><br />In the end, an entire city is devastated, good people suffer or lay dead strewn across the carnage-filled streets of New York, the corrupt thrive as ever, and the greatest of heroes turn out be the greatest of failures.<br /><br />\\"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes.\\"<br />\\"Who watches the watchmen?\\"<br />-Juvenal, Satires, VI, 347<br /><br />The climax of \\"Watchmen\\" is delightfully nihilistic and shows Moore's dislike of neat-and-tidy happy endings. What he delivers is a darkly humorous and disturbing finale, which perfectly encapsulates the emotional reality of his psychologically flawed characters.<br /><br />What Alan Moore gives us, as readers, is a pessimistic yet not inaccurate view of America's inability to take responsibility for itself. The main problem being that, on a whole, our nation is too quick to rely on heroes, icons, celebrities, and powerful political and religious organizations. Rather than being self-reliant, we surrender what little power we have to those who hunger for it the most. We lie back and complain about the woes of our world, but we are too lazy to take action. While self-appointed heroes prove themselves to be insecure and amoral, we are equally guilty as we are tainted by apathy and a reluctance to help ourselves and others. We glorify and vilify heroes and public figures, as we glorify and vilify all leaders, but when we cast down those leaders we fail to uphold their burden of responsibility. We fail, as they fail.<br /><br />If there were a single message or moral to Alan Moore's story, it would have to be that we must all become heroes or else we are all naught but villains. There is no middle ground, no in-between, not so long as we are inert and submissive. The story also carries an anarchic message about relying on authority figures to protect us. Authority is often obtained by the enforcement of power and anyone capable of enforcing or asserting their power on another individual cannot be trusted. In this sense, Watchmen is about how we must abandon our tendencies to rely on external powers, be they religious, economic, or political organizations. The people who succeed, or seemingly succeed, within these organizations have only done so because they are corrupt and willing to exploit those weaker than themselves in order to possess even greater power.<br /><br />Just as writer Alan Moore revolutionized the art of storytelling in comics with his vast interweaving narrative, so too did artist  Dave Gibbons raise the bar in the graphic storytelling medium. Gibbon's work on Watchmen is simple and understated. It recalls comic books of the `60s and yet it is very unique to its own time period. In the `80s, many comic book artists pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable, greatly emphasizing sexual and violent content, but Gibbons never sunk to the amateurish level of exploitation that many artists of the era succumbed to. Instead his style reflects the world we live in and the world of the Watchmen, while colorist  John Higgins' unique use of colors creates a memorable secondary reality that is both very familiar and foreign.<br /><br />In Alan Moore's brilliant \\"Watchmen\\" saga, he embraces certain themes that are reminiscent of other great works of literature. \\"Watchmen\\" is as detailed as J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"; as brilliantly convoluted in its non-linear narrative as Bram Stoker's \\"[[ASIN:0393970124 Dracula ]]\\"; its political commentary and satire equal  George Orwell's \\"[[ASIN:B003ZX868W Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984]]\\" and  Ray Bradbury's \\"[[ASIN:0345342968 Fahrenheit 451]]\\"; it's as dark and psychologically complex as  Philip K. Dick's \\"[[ASIN:1400096901 A Scanner Darkly]]\\"; it's as contemplative and poetic as William Shakespeare's \\"[[ASIN:0451526775 Macbeth]]\\". Yet it is as original as any of those works were when they were first published.<br /><br />Rarely in comic books can a reader go through panel by panel and uncover layer upon layer of visual metaphors, hidden symbolism, and artistic and narrative motifs that are carried throughout. Yet this is common on every single panel and page of \\"Watchmen\\", partly because of  Alan Moore's meticulous description of each scene, but also because of the unique inventiveness of  Dave Gibbons' artwork, which hearkens back to the comic book artists of the Silver Age.<br />It's not often that one goes out of their way to praise a colorist in their critique of a comic book or graphic novel, but  John Higgins' contributions to the overall look of \\"Watchmen\\" cannot go overlooked. Going completely against the grain, Higgins used secondary colors (greens, oranges, pinks, and purples) rather than primary colors (reds, yellows, and blues), which are more typical in the graphic medium. This unconventional approach was at first questioned because some felt that the color palette was unattractive, but Higgins explained that it was intended to reflect the reality of New York in the 1980s and the neon signs and garish wallpapers that were then popular.<br /><br />The \\"Watchmen\\" has been celebrated as a milestone in graphic literature, yet it has also caused controversy for its anarchic message and it portrayal of corrupt and unreliable institutions, whether they be political, religious, social, economic, or scientific. \\"Watchmen\\" is a work of pure genius, both irreverent and relevant. Irreverent in that it deconstructs the beloved icon of the American superhero and satirizes the worse aspects of the American society and government, and relevant in that it took a great progressive leap forward in the evolution of comic books and in that it dared to criticize the conservative political structure of the 1980s. It is this combination of irreverence and relevance that gives the book much of its appeal.<br /><br />In the final view, \\"Watchmen\\" is too complex to summarize, just as our world cannot be summarized. It succeeds in telling a story so complex, both thematically and structurally, that it defies all categories, stereotypes, and genres. It is truly a transcendent work of art.terman, now dubbed Dr. Manhattan (named after the Manhattan Project), becomes more and more detached emotionally, until finally he begins to disassociate himself from all of humanity.<br /><br />\\"On Hallowe'en the old ghosts come about us, and they speak to some; to others they are dumb.\\"<br />-Eleanor Farjeon in the poem Hallowe'en<br /><br />Meanwhile Rorschach continues his vigilant quest, all the while society falls apart around him, reinforcing his fanatical apocalyptic religious beliefs.<br /><br />Former superhero Ozymandias, a.k.a. Adrian Veidt, now an egotistical entrepeneur, who exploits his own celebrity for financial and political gain, is said to be one of the most intelligent men alive. So, naturally Rorschach distrusts him, as well as former hero Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl, who vocally expressed his dislike of the violent and morally deviant Comedian.<br /><br />\\"It would be a stronger world, a stronger loving world, to die in.\\"<br />-John Cale in the song Santies<br /><br />But as Rorschach and the other heroes come closer to the truth, as the mystery of The Comedian's death unfolds, it becomes grossly apparent that the \\"Watchmen\\" and their superhero fraternity was comprised of severely flawed individuals: rapists, murderers, racists, psychopaths, and opportunists.<br /><br />In the end, an entire city is devastated, good people suffer or lay dead strewn across the carnage-filled streets of New York, the corrupt thrive as ever, and the greatest of heroes turn out be the greatest of failures.<br /><br />\\"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes.\\"<br />\\"Who watches the watchmen?\\"<br />-Juvenal, Satires, VI, 347<br /><br />The climax of \\"Watchmen\\" is delightfully nihilistic and shows Moore's dislike of neat-and-tidy happy endings. What he delivers is a darkly humorous and disturbing finale, which perfectly encapsulates the emotional reality of his psychologically flawed characters.<br /><br />What Alan Moore gives us, as readers, is a pessimistic yet notinaccurate view of America's inability to take responsibility for itself. The main problem being that, on a whole, our nation is too quick to rely on heroes, icons, celebrities, and powerful political and religious organizations. Rather than being self-reliant, we surrender what little power we have to those who hunger for it the most. We lie back and complain about the woes of our world, but we are too lazy to take action. While self-appointed heroes prove themselves to be insecure and amoral, we are equally guilty as we are tainted by apathy and a reluctance to help ourselves and others. We glorify and vilify heroes and public figures, as we glorify and vilify all leaders, but when we cast down those leaders we fail to uphold their burden of responsibility. We fail, as they fail.<br /><br />If there were a single message or moral to Alan Moore's story, it would have to be that we must all become heroes or else we are all naught but villains. There is no middle ground, no in-between, not so long as we are inert and submissive. The story also carries an anarchic message about relying on authority figures to protect us. Authority is often obtained by the enforcement of power and anyone capable of enforcing or asserting their power on another individual cannot be trusted. In this sense, Watchmen is about how we must abandon our tendencies to rely on external powers, be they religious, economic, or political organizations. The people who succeed, or seemingly succeed, within these organizations have only done so because they are corrupt and willing to exploit those weaker than themselves in order to possess even greater power.<br /><br />Just as writer Alan Moore revolutionized the art of storytelling in comics with his vast interweaving narrative, so too did artist  Dave Gibbons raise the bar in the graphic storytelling medium. Gibbon's work on Watchmen is simple and understated. It recalls comic books of the `60s and yet it is very unique to its own time period. In the `80s, many comic book artists pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable, greatly emphasizing sexual and violent content, but Gibbons never sunk to the amateurish level of exploitation that many artists of the era succumbed to. Instead his style reflects the world we live in and the world of the Watchmen, while colorist  John Higgins' unique use of colors creates a memorable secondary reality that is both very familiar and foreign.<br /><br />In Alan Moore's brilliant \\"Watchmen\\" saga, he embraces certain themes that are reminiscent of other great works of literature. \\"Watchmen\\" is as detailed as J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"; as brilliantly convoluted in its non-linear narrative as Bram Stoker's \\"[[ASIN:0393970124 Dracula ]]\\"; its political commentary and satire equal  George Orwell's \\"[[ASIN:B003ZX868W Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984]]\\" and  Ray Bradbury's \\"[[ASIN:0345342968 Fahrenheit 451]]\\"; it's as dark and psychologically complex as  Philip K. Dick's \\"[[ASIN:1400096901 A Scanner Darkly]]\\"; it's as contemplative and poetic as William Shakespeare's \\"[[ASIN:0451526775 Macbeth]]\\". Yet it is as original as any of those works were when they were first published.<br /><br />Rarely in comic books can a reader go through panel by panel and uncover layer upon layer of visual metaphors, hidden symbolism, and artistic and narrative motifs that are carried throughout. Yet this is common on every single panel and page of \\"Watchmen\\", partly because of  Alan Moore's meticulous description of each scene, but also because of the unique inventiveness of  Dave Gibbons' artwork, which hearkens back to the comic book artists of the Silver Age.<br />It's not often that one goes out of their way to praise a colorist in their critique of a comic book or graphic novel, but  John Higgins' contributions to the overall look of \\"Watchmen\\" cannot go overlooked. Going completely against the grain, Higgins used secondary colors (greens, oranges, pinks, and purples) rather than primary colors (reds, yellows, and blues), which are more typical in the graphic medium. This unconventional approach was at first questioned because some felt that the color palette was unattractive, but Higgins explained that it was intended to reflect the reality of New York in the 1980s and the neon signs and garish wallpapers that were then popular.<br /><br />The \\"Watchmen\\" has been celebrated as a milestone in graphic literature, yet it has also caused controversy for its anarchic message and it portrayal of corrupt and unreliable institutions, whether they be political, religious, social, economic, or scientific. \\"Watchmen\\" is a work of pure genius, both irreverent and relevant. Irreverent in that it deconstructs the beloved icon of the American superhero and satirizes the worse aspects of the American society and government, and relevant in that it took a great progressive leap forward in the evolution of comic books and in that it dared to criticize the conservative political structure of the 1980s. It is this combination of irreverence and relevance that gives the book much of its appeal.<br /><br />In the final view, \\"Watchmen\\" is too complex to summarize, just as our world cannot be summarized. It succeeds in telling a story so complex, both thematically and structurally, that it defies all categories, stereotypes, and genres. It is truly a transcendent work of art.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Had meant to see this one in the theatre, because these types of titles are the ones that I actually go to the theatre to see, but I never made it.  However, I did put it on my Netflix right away when it was available and got it right at the time I got my surround sound and whatnot hooked up in my wife and I's new residence.  It wasn't theatre quality, but it was pretty close to the next best thing, and I thought that it was a pretty awesome ending for the movie franchise.  Leave it to Michael Bay to make kick@$$ films like this one.  I think he was a good choice to helm these movies!
B00466HN86|4.0|This unique film is founded on Christian principles. Because of this fact, many people will neglect the opportunity to watch it. Christian or not, this production provides a message for its audience that is not common in today's movies. The movie consists of four law enforcement officers Adam Mitchell, Nathan Hayes, Shane Fuller, and David Thompson striving to fulfill their duties on the force. However, what matters most according to director Alex Kendrick is their duties as fathers and spiritual leaders of the family. One officer, Adam Mitchell, realizes this when his young daughter is killed in a car crash. Regret immediately fills Mitchell's heart and he sets out to become an established patriarch.  The movie presents a shocking statistic of the chances children get involved with gangs, alcohol, drugs, and other harmful substances when they do not have a morally sound father-figure. From then on, the movie elaborates on the message that every father needs to not only spend time with his sons and daughters, but needs to go deeper than that. Fathers are obligated to express love and compassion for their family as a whole. Fathers ought to strengthen their children's relationships with God and lead them towards right over wrong. The dads are examples of who children look up to and usually try to model after. Adam Mitchell proclaims all of these beliefs in a resolution that he writes up. He commits to his self-made resolution by signing his name on it. His three fellow officers and one friend decide to make the same commitment. The five of them set off together to abide by the resolution for the rest of their lives. The movie presents shootings, drug trafficking, and other gang-related activities. One of the police officers struggles with one of these incidents and fails to abide by the resolution. He comes to realize how wrong he was and that he messed up. Although the friends were let down, they still respected him for who he was. The director was portraying how anyone can fall from a commitment they make.     The dialogue among the characters provides a chilling feel throughout the film. However, the movie portrays many comedic statements and scenes. The characters bring God into the picture quite often with strong words and express his significance in their lives. It feels as if one is listening to a sermon, which can be repetitive and boring hearing over and over again. There are references to bible passages in scripture, which may not sit well with someone who is skeptical about how evident God is in their life. There is an agnostic character that signs the resolution. He has a realization within himself later about how he needs to reconnect with his daughter. Some may say this part is cheesy because he can't suddenly love God within that short of a time. However, the main point is that he himself grew the courage to make a change in his life after he was struck by a lesson about God. The director attempts to bring God's significance in the movie in this way as well. The officers demonstrate their spiritual leading roles in their families as the film's falling action takes place. They fulfill the responsibilities that they set out for themselves, which is a little farfetched in reality. As the movie closes, they challenge all fathers to take the same path as they did. Dads can accept this challenge or they can choose to laugh it off.   Overall, the acting is not up to par and is rather mediocre. There are hardly any special effects and it has a simple feel to it. The movie is featured in select theatres, which contributes to its lower quality compared to today's hit movies. If one can enjoy a film without fancy technology, explosions, or superb acting then they ought to watch this production.
0141439513|5.0|I doubt I'm saying anything here that someone somewhere hasn't already said... but, here it goes! In my own opinion...<br /><br />Perhaps one of the best books ever written, Austen takes us into 19th century rural England, where a woman's primary duty was to marry and marry well, since inheritance was out of the question. This novel tells the classic story of the rich, eligible bachelor, Fitzwilliam Darcy, who could have anyone he wanted, and young, but outspoken and bold Elizabeth Bennet, the second eldest of five girls who's family lives fairly well but ranks rather low on the social class spectrum. Hence, it's expected that she would marry should she be offered a reasonable and comfortable home, regardless of how she feels.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet may be one of literature's best heroines. Her complex and genuine character, her honesty and courage to remain true to herself regardless of the situation, makes her a lovable heroine, and one that can be related to regardless of time period. And let's admit, she is just downright witty. Darcy, while mistakenly perceived as proud and arrogant, turns out to be one the most gentlemanly and courteous men, a kind soul and romantic heart once he lets down his guard and exposes his true self. His qualities are ones women still crave to find in men today.<br /><br />The characters, realistic and well-rounded, the accurate portrayal of 19th century British social life and setting, and Austen's superb writing creates a masterpiece full of romance, pride, social status, family values, and prejudice. This timeless romantic tale is one of the best love stories of all time, a true classic! I absolutely adored this book!

I'm going to look on the bright side and convince myself I paid extra for the \\"Inappropriate edition\\". To claim this includes a digital copy IS inappropriate.  We all have become accustomed that when a package says +Digital Copy it means you get a dvd or the capability to download a copy to your computer to play on portable devices.  This package includes the right to stream the movie. Maybe I want to watch on a plane with NO internet access. Not to mention the folks whom data plan is limited to a certain amount of gigs.  One more thing to watch out for. You got me this time. Shame on you!
B002JCSRKC|4.0|Just got these boots today.  Size 8 is more like 8.5 but very roomy for thick socks.  If you wear a half size you are pretty much screwed, but it is bearable.  Light as a cloud but very stiff.  I am happy so far...we will see if they hold up to the elements..I imagine they will..I still have a pair of original crocs.  My advice is this: If you want a rain boot this is fine.  If you want a fashion boot there are better choices.  These are rubber so they will not breathe well.  My feet were warm after 5 minutes....fyi, it's a rain boot...it serves a basic purpose and manages to look cute as well.  Would recommend.

B001VB8UAE|3.0|Well don't get me wrong I'm a big Barbra fan. The 2006 Live in concert is a wonderful show and it looks great, I also picked up the blu ray which I must say looks stunning. What I really wanted from here was the original Emmy winning concert special from 94. I already had the dvd of The Concert from the 93/94 Live at the MGM Grand which looked and sounded stunning on dvd (It was given a great new 5.1 Dolby Digital Mix) even though it was really only filmed for posterity and archival reasons as it was Barbra's return to the concert stage after 27 years. However, I was greatly dissapointed by the presentation of the original special. It looked liked it had just been dubbed from the VHS, even the laserdisc looked better. It sounds like they have just used the original AC3 Dolby Digital mix from the laserdisc. I was so looking forward to Peter Morse's beautiful lighting in the Lazy Afternoon sequence and a great sound mix, the Yentl medley and Somewhere would have been stunning as well.This concert was Barbra at her best and deserves a better presentation. I wonder if this special can be put on Blu Ray. I know for sure Timeless was filmed in HD so that can be put to blu ray, but in the early 90's I'm not so sure. Suggestion, either a full restoration of the special or hit the editing room and do it all again (Camera angels, audio remix etc) Oh one can only dream, Although Barbra says \\"It's never finished you just have to hand it over\\" So minus a star for this special, same goes for the Making of the Broadway album just a poor transfer. It's strange even the 60's Television specials look better.  Anybody have any thoughts?
0802136834|5.0|If you want the true story of Henry VIII and his wives, don't expect to get it by watching the television series \\"The Tudors.\\" Read this book instead.<br /><br />\\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" is a tour de force that examines the lives - and deaths - of each of King Henry VIII's six wives in depth. This was the first Alison Weir book I ever read, and I've been a fan of her work (on the whole) ever since. I can't even begin to imagine the years of research, scholarship, organizing and writing this work must have involved, but it paid off.<br /><br />Ms. Weir uses primary and secondary historical records to trace the lives of each of Henry's queens and present objective, sympathetic and, most importantly, FACTUAL portraits of their personalities. Along the way, she disproves many of the myths that have accumulated about them - for example, that Anne Boleyn was a notorious adulteress (she was actually set up by Henry's chief minister Thomas Cromwell because Henry wished to have sufficient grounds to get rid of her); that Anne dropped a handkerchief to one of her \\"lovers\\" during a May Day tournament (this was a story that was made up by a hostile source years later but is recorded nowhere in contemporary sources); that Jane Seymour underwent a Caesarian section during her ill-fated labor with Henry's son Edward (actually, this operation was probably never performed on a living mother until 1610); that Anne of Cleves fainted when told Henry wished to divorce her (again, this is an apocryphal story); and that Katherine Parr was a friend of the Protestant Anne Askew (although Katherine sympathized with Askew's Protestant views, there is no evidence that Katherine ever met or knew her).<br /><br />This book is a prime example of Ms. Weir's talent for making even historical non-fiction read like a novel - when she has sufficient source material to work with.  When she is dealing with poorly documented periods of history or historical figures (as she did in \\"Eleanor of Aquitaine: A Life,\\" \\"The Princes in the Tower,\\" and her latest book \\"Mary Boleyn: The Mistress of Kings\\"), she often makes educated guesses about actions, motivations, and even personality. Luckily, the Tudor period of English history is amply documented, and this abundance of historical records allows Ms. Weir to fashion richly detailed and beautifully narrated portrayals of all six queens as well as King Henry himself (certainly an imperious man who turned into a tyrant in his later years, but also with many intellectual gifts and good personal virtues, including a curious streak of sentimentality).<br /><br />On the negative side, this book is quite a lot to get through at almost 600 pages (it's definitely not light summer reading), and it may seem a little dry to those who are not interested in research or factual details. If you're a history buff and/or a Tudor aficionado, though, you'll love it.<br /><br />This book is actually only the first of three books Ms. Weir has written about the Tudor monarchs.

B0013ND30W|2.0|Whoever \\"enhanced\\" the colors in this version of Sleeping Beauty ruined them.  The Princess either drinks too much or spent quality time with solar radiation because her skin glows pink - when it is not disconcertingly changing color.  You can see an example of the type of completely awful skin discoloration I mean in one of the pictures posted above on the listing: the three fairies looking into the cradle.  Okay, so maybe fairies have unnatural skin, but everyone else?  Notice that in that picture the wood of the cradle is pink too.  I know little girls love pink, but did they have to tint EVERYTHING that color?)<br /><br />If you watch the commercial for this where they show the original coloration and the \\"enhanced\\" version side by side, it's pretty obvious the original colors look more natural.  The enhanced stuff looks florescent.  It would be bad enough if that's all that was wrong, but they didn't keep it even.  Things change tint at random, sometimes when all they're doing is just standing there.  If you have a choice, get the older version of this - skip the \\"new, enhanced\\" hack job.

The movie company missed a chance to make \\"Blade\\" even better than it originally was.
B000002U9W|4.0|Pink Floyd gradually began to crawl out of the long shadow that Syd Barrett had cast by the time they released \\"Atom Heart Mother\\". The song is a 23 minute instrumental that Pink Floyd composed and left to composer/arranger Ron Geeson to embelish with orchestra, strings and choir. It's a most unusual pairing and works surprisingly well even if it is as much Geeson (who worked with Roger Waters on the soundtrack for \\"The Body\\")as it is Floyd. The remaster has a nice dynamic range, detail and sounds quite good.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are broken up into 4-5 minute songs by, respectively, Waters (\\"If\\" a folk tinged song), Wright (\\"Summer of '69\\")and Gilmour (\\"Fat Out Sun\\" which sounds like a long, lost outtake from The Kinks \\"Something Else\\" album right down to Gilmour's faux Ray Davies vocal). The album closes with \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" something that only PF could get away with; amid the sound effects of \\"Alan\\" preparing and cooking breakfast we get an instrumental that, well, \\"consumes\\" your attention and closes the album with a dose of humor (I'm sure it was intended somewhat tongue-in-cheek).<br /><br />The packaging isn't as accurate as the \\"Oh By The Way\\" boxed set which had mini-replica sleeves that were fairly accurate to the original vinly packaging but it's pretty good all the same. The album is presented in a gatefold sleeve along with a booklet with the credits for the album as well as lyrics for the three songs.<br /><br />\\"Atom Heart Mother\\" gives us a snapshot of the band as they were finally beginning to find their way without their founding member. This is a good album that may not quite deliver on its promise with the 23 minute album opener but is still entertaining to listen to. Keep in mind this sounds little to nothing like \\"Dark Side\\", \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\".<br /><br />Recommended.
B005OIAFQC|4.0|Automatic is another incarnation of the style invoked in Matter And Form.  After listening to it several times, and going back and listening to Judgment and Of Faith, Power, And Glory, it stands out as having a more distinct personality.  It is very upbeat, positive, and above all, clean.  Previous albums have had moments of the expected crunchy, aggressive industrial club sounds, a la Combichrist or Wumpscut, and this one has done away with it entirely.  This has given people to calling it an 80's style, and there are definitely some Giorgio Moroder arpeggiations, but it doesn't feel very 80s overall.  Just clean, very positive VNV.  Ronan's vocal production, and the crispness of the keyboards, have never sounded better.  The songwriting is decent but not his best.  The lyrics are more interesting than most bands in this genre, but not his best either.<br /><br />If Empires is an album for post-breakup clubby angst, Automatic is hope rekindled on a summer day's drive.
B004ASNG04|3.0|I wanted this book to convince me, because I liked the first few chapters on early human history. But having finished it, I agree with most of what the one-, two- and three-star reviewers have to say about the weaknesses of this book, so I won't repeat them here in every detail.  What I liked best about the book was the sweeping grandeur of the tale of early human ascension, the summary of chinese history, which I don't know much about, and the funny way in which the book is written. The author has a wry sense of humor.  This gets the book 3 stars. Also, creating an index of any kind is hard work; I know because I did so myself on a much smaller scale with mason's wages over two hundred years. Not many historians go through the trouble of collecting hard data (by which I mean numerical instead of textual data), much less over long periods of time. Having the data for such an index collected in one place and available for further research is worth much, so again, 3 stars just for that, even though I also know, from my own experience, how difficult it is to turn data into a meaningful index, and I'm not convinced that the index of social development the author created can actually be used for the purpose he states.  In the end, however, the book left me disappointed. I have no clearer understanding now why the west rules than I had before. Because the fifth horseman of the apocalypse was killed? Because the Atlantic was narrower than the Pacific? Really? That's it? Apart from that, I didn't find any ideas about how history \\"works\\" in it that I didn't already know. I don't need to go into any detail about the rambling last chapter full of weird conjectures about the future; suffice it to say I imagine that's what a bad trip on heroin feels like. Historians are, as Morris himself says, notoriously bad in predicting the future, and as an archaeologist, he should know better than to try. Frankly, the whole thing is embarrassing for someone in the author's position, starting with his first assumption, namely that extrapolating his index into the future gives him *any* kind of meaningful descriptive power.  But I did find a pattern *in* the book: It gets worse the farther you read. My personal guess is that either Morris got bored with it and wanted to finish quickly, or he got so absorbed in believing his index described the \\"shape of history\\" that he stopped to worry about supporting any of his assumptions with real arguments. His chainsaw art method may be convincing for periods we (or I, anyway) know little about, but it breaks down quickly when he talks about the last thousand years. By the time he tried to explain western development after the renaissance solely with the needs of a very roughly sketched atlantic economy, I wasn't doing much except scratching my head.  One thing I didn't mind which other reviewers had problems with was his definition of the west (everything that can be traced back to the fertile crescent core). I thought it was a clever way to avoid the problems that haunt Huntington's clash of civilizations. Then again, this just shows that Morris' theory, even if it was correct, wouldn't explain much at all, because the two main analytic concepts (west and east) are so broad as to be meaningless as guides for the present.  Final verdict: An enjoyable read if you leave out the last few chapters and concentrate on the summaries on prehistory and chinese history instead of the actual question the book fails to answer.
B005HIBWFW|5.0|Ken Russell's most fully realized, gloriously and thematically integrated film (although some make a good case for The Devils, see the Joseph Gomez book) is FINALLY in letterboxed widescreen DVD!  No more pan-and-scan!<br /><br />Those not fortunate, as I was, to see it in a theater (it was once popular on the art-house/revival circuit) can now see that when Nina has her panic attack, her mother is also in the room, saying nothing, looking at her from behind with knowing disdain; that Madame Von Meck has both twin sons on the couch when we first meet them, and on either side of her in the carriage when it passes Tchaikovsky in the forest, each son turning to look down at her swoon with pity and alarm (a good laugh in the theater), the parallel of Tchaikovsky and Chiluvsky on either side of Nina at the outdoor Swan Lake ballet, the full scale of the thrilling winter festival opening sequence, and the satisfaction of seeing the full lush design.  Watch how a former TV director stretches a low budget to appear lavish!<br /><br />Not being an audiophile/videophile, I can't speak with technical precision to the look and sound, but while no extra effort seems to have gone into remastering or cleanup, a quality print was used, and the sound is markedly superior to the VHS tracks.  I'd quibble with the mix for the 1812 Overture sequence, the orchestra too quiet under the cannons.  Included is the interesting theatrical trailer, but no other extras, and no chapter divisions -- you can only navigate forward and back at 10-minute intervals.  But so what?  You need to watch it all from start to finish, the way David Lynch likes his DVDs to be watched, eliminating divisions entirely.<br /><br />To be fair, one Russian's take:  a dear friend of mine from Kazan, taking up my probably tactless invitation to watch, questioned the whole point of the film.  Putting aside her annoyance at the knock at her country's greatest composer (an old friend is from Tchaikovsky's home village), she asked what we gain from this portrait?  That when he composed his piano concerto, he was thinking of his sister?  Etc.  I gave her Russell's own answer, and the reason the film isn't titled \\"Tchaikovsky\\":  it's really about dreamers, and their need to live in dreams to the avoidance of engaging with their lives, or drive themselves to bring gauzy dreams to life, and spoil or ruin the lives around them.  Russell's immediate inspiration was the false reality in TV commercials, and the piano concerto/sister fantasy a deliberate mockery.<br /><br />And it's STILL seductive, of course!  Which lends the film its immense visual and emotional impact.<br /><br />The hazy, dewy memory of Tchaikovsky as a little boy playing piano while his beautiful, beloved mother sings, kisses and praises him with shining eyes and the prettiest, most loving smile I've ever seen on film, is followed by his panic and horror at being carried out of the room when she dies from cholera, blighting his entire emotional life, it would seem.<br /><br />(This answer didn't persuade my friend.  I gather that Russians are more realistic generally than Westerners, and less apt to lose themselves in romantic fantasies.  So it's a film for us, about us, as The Devils was really about the modern political era, not 17th-century France.  But she loved Savage Messiah, Women in Love, and The Rainbow.)<br /><br />Anyway:  GET THIS DVD -- spread the word -- do not let this near-masterpiece be forgotten!<br /><br />Russell recently had a stroke or TIA, and may not be with us much longer.  There will be a burst of interest when he finally passes, may it be delayed (he's still working!) but will likely fade thereafter.  When he visited the Dallas USA Film Festival to show off The Fall of the Louse of Usher, I had the pleasure of standing up and informing the crowd that Francis Ford Coppola had said he intentionally shot Apocalypse Now in Russell's style.

1892005034|4.0|The book goes through practical steps and examples of how to effectively apply the techniques of nonviolent communication.  It is realistic and practical.  There are times when I get frustrated and annoyed in my ability to understand or get through to someone.  What this book does is to provide ways in which to work through frustrating situation and effectively get to a place where you are heard and understood.  It also gives me ways to be with and around others who may be unable to express their desires, but are genuinely wants to do that.  What you have are workable solutions to getting related to others and developing deep relationships.  It works not only with families and friends, but also with business partners and coworkers.  It is most useful for effective negotiating.
0679735909|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a fellow UC alum.  She majored in English Lit. and I was in the Political Science department, which may account for our differing views of the book.  I found the book to be heavy in every regard--physically and literarily.  And though some of the language was very beautiful, I found most of it to be dense, murky, and arcane. The latter overcame the former, and I found myself simply wanting the book to end.  I also found the story too neat and tidy.  No loose ends here, no unanswered questions, nothing left to ask or imagine about the characters.  Not the return I expected for my time investment.

I almost didn't want to finish it because it would be over (if that makes any sense). What a great dog book and from the dog's point of view.  I looked at my dogs a little closer once I finished this book and wondered what they were really tyring to tell me.

0385738773|3.0|The strengths of the \\"Maze Runner\\" trilogy lie in the compelling nature of its mysteries; a final book in such a series faces the challenge of answering just enough to satisfy the reader without completely destroying the spell.  So I don't fault the author for choosing not to answer many of the key questions raised in the first two books.  I won't provide spoilers about specifically which questions go unanswered, but if you've come to the final book expecting some of the key mysteries solved: prepare to be disappointed. Some mysteries are best unanswered.  The original \\"Maze Runner\\" is a compelling and well-told story.  The \\"Scorch Trial\\" has weaker moments but provides a suspenseful horrific setting.  By the \\"Death Cure\\", the weaker elements of the book begin to dominate, perhaps because the plot unravels enough for us to notice the complete lack of character development, a very poorly developed romantic triangle, and an almost manic compulsion to move from one action scene to the next. As the books continue, you care about these characters less rather than more, in part because they reveal less and less about themselves.  This last book is largely the kind of prolonged climax one typically sees in Hollywood movies, where everything blows up and our protagonist miraculously survives increasingly implausible battles over and over again.  I found myself skimming the last third of the book, just wanting it to be over.
0981951244|5.0|I just read a great life and career success advice book, The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy.  Darren is the publisher of SUCCESS Magazine - my favorite periodical.  The subtitle, Multiplying Your Success, One Simple Step at a Time captures the essence of the book.<br /><br />Darren lays out a simple formula in the first chapter...<br /><br />Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE<br /><br />According to Darren, \\"Small, seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a radical difference\\" in your life and put you on the road to the career success you want and deserve.  I agree.<br /><br />The next five chapters of The Compound Effect are dedicated to five simple success strategies.  If you apply these strategies you can't help but creating your life and career success...<br /><br />1. Choices<br />2. Habits<br />3. Momentum<br />4. Influences<br />5. Acceleration<br /><br />Darren discusses each of these strategies in depth and then provides several action steps at the end of each chapter.  Below, I've listed the action steps that meant the most to me and to which I've committed to doing for each of the five success strategies.<br /><br />Choices<br /><br />Where in your life are you not taking 100% responsibility for the success or failure of your present condition?  Write down three things you have done in the past that have messed things up.  List three things you should have done, but didn't.  Write out three things that happened to you but your responded poorly.  Write down three things you can start doing right now to take back responsibility for the outcomes of your life.<br /><br />Habits<br /><br />Identify your three best habits - those that support your most important goal.  Identify your three worst habits - those that take you off course from your most important goal.  Identify three new habits you need to develop to put you on track toward your most important goal.<br /><br />Momentum<br /><br />List three areas of life in which you are not consistent enough.  What has this inconsistency cost you in life?<br /><br />Make a declaration to stay steadfast in your new commitment to consistency.<br /><br />Write down a half dozen key behaviors relevant to your new goals.  These should be behaviors ou want to establish a rhythm with and eventually create momentum.<br /><br />Influences<br /><br />Identify the influence the input of media and information is having on your life.  Determine what input you need to protect your mind from and how you are going to keep your mind regularly flushed with positive, uplifting and supportive input.<br /><br />Evaluate your current associations.  With whom might you need to limit your association?  With whom might you need to completely dissociate?  Strategy ways you will expand your positive associations.<br /><br />Acceleration<br /><br />Identify those times you hit moments of truth, so you know when to push through to find new growth, and separate yourself from others and your old self.<br /><br />Identify three areas in your life where you can do more.  Identify three areas of your live where you can beat your own expectations.  Identify three ways you can do the unexpected.  Where can you differentiate yourself from what is common, normal or expected?<br /><br />These are all great action items to help you create the life and career success you want and deserve.  You can begin working on them now.  Or you can do a really smart thing and get and read a copy of The Compound Effect to help you really understand the importance of taking these actions.  You can purchase a copy on Amazon.com.  Here is the url: [...]<br /><br />I like The Compound Effect because it is based on simple common sense principles.  I also like it because it asks you to take a hard look at yourself.  Many self help and success books skip this important step.  I believe that before you can get better, it's important to acknowledge the mistakes you've made inthe past.<br /><br />For example, when it comes to choices, Darren suggests, \\"Write down three things you have done in the past that have messed things up.  List three things you should have done, but didn't.\\"  This was tough for me.  I had to acknowledge that I've made some pretty poor choices in the past.  However, acknowledging  these poor choices made it easier for me to apply to rest of the advice, \\"Write down three things you can start doing right now to take back responsibility for the outcomes of your life.\\"<br /><br />There is simple common sense here.  As Darren Hardy points out, small smart actions repeated over and over again will yield big results when it comes to your life and career success.  If you consistently make smart choices, engage in positive habits, build momentum, spend time with the right influencers and accelerate your progress you will become a life and career success.

0345479092|5.0|Even though \\"attachment parenting\\" is all the rage right now, I was the oldest in a large family and observed how my younger siblings were raised - and I knew that I would lean toward the idea of scheduled feedings/sleeping when I became a parent. I wanted to feel like a person still and be able to plan mine and my baby's days instead of being at the whim of its cries (that I couldn't really interpret anyway)!<br /><br />I originally read and was interested in the Babywise method and was surprised to see such a backlash against the book and that people told me that I'd be starving my child if I didn't feed on-demand! While I still like the Babywise method and have learned from the book, I've found Secrets of the Baby Whisperer to be even more helpful. I love the EASY routine (eat, activity, sleep, your time) which is basically the same method as Babywise, only a little more flexible.<br /><br />What I especially love about Baby Whisperer is that the author gives so many specifics about each of the four initials. My daughter is only 3.5 weeks old right now, but the sleep section especially has been helping me immensely and giving me suggestions for how to soothe her so that she'll fall asleep...in her own bed. I'm excited that my daughter is starting to sleep better and more soundly at night and I'm able to really feel like I'm getting some rest because I know what to expect from my days!<br /><br />I suggest it to any and all new parents who want a more realistic approach to raising a baby than the whole \\"attachment parenting\\" thing, yet they still need/want advice on things such as sleep, feeding, schedules, and communicating with your baby.<br /><br />As a side note: I'm actually very much into some aspects of more natural parenting and even had a home water birth with my daughter, so I'm not against Attachment Parenting at all - I just prefer to have a more structured approach when it comes to raising an infant in order to keep me sane. :)
B0014JKJHK|5.0|Bought these shoes for work.  I work at a restraunt. Talk about comfortable.  They are not only that but they are deffinetly slip proof and well work the money.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|One of the great movies of 2011!  Great fun, action movie to watch while not overdoing the comic aspect of the characters.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|My daughter wanted these shoes sooo bad since they are the \\"in\\" thing. I tried to find a lightly used pair on ebay, but there weren't any(I now know why). I let her try them on at a local boutique so we would get the correct size and she insisted that she had to have them. I agreed to pay half if she paid the other half. She is only 9 and used her birthday money. Anyway, she wore these shoes only a couple of times a week as it was summer and still hot. Three months later they are trash. Big holes in both toes, the soles are worn, and they smell worse than a wet dog. She would have been better off with a pair of dollar store shoes(which is what they look like anyway). Hopefully this experience has taught her a lesson--price does not guarantee quality.
B000JIHP88|1.0|This product was a dissapointment.  The motor worked for about 15 minutes, then died.

I will hesitate before ever buying a FisherPrice item again.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|It appeared this might be eastwood's final staring role in a movie but not quite since 'Trouble with the curve' came out.  Who knows since that might still not be his last.  Nonetheless, Gran Torino has a little of everything to satisfy most movie buffs.  A well written story line with some action, suspense, humor and even maybe a few tears for the soft hearted.  I guess the film touches me personally since I was born and from the Detroit area but brings awareness the issues of gang's in many big metropolitan areas of the country.  As a lone solider, eastwood takes on these gangs with his own brand of justice.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller

B005QYKE2Y|1.0|I went into this movie hoping it could be better than TF2. It is, but not by much. I'm going to be honest. I think Transformers 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I saw the 3rd one, but the Chicago part looked interesting. Little did I know it would take 2 long boring hours to get that part. On top of that. It wasn't even that impressive. I hate Shia's parents. I hate his new girlfriend. I hate Michael Bay humor. I hate this movie and I hate the fact I spent 12 bucks to go see it. I don't think Michael Bay understand that everything gets boring without a plot or some kind of tension going on. It's so BORING. I literally sat in the theater hoping it was over only to look at my watch and see that only 10 minutes had passed.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! When I had heard that it was going to be a prequel, I wasn't sure that I would like it. Why go backward when we already know the outcome? But this story was just awesome; I couldn't put it down. I wouldn't suggest reading this as your 1st Reacher story even though it will lead you right into the 1st one (The Killing Floor). You really need to already have a feel for Reacher's personality and way of doing things because Child does not spend any time with character development in this one. I'm not sure he even describes Reacher except when he is describing his shirt size. The beginning chapter actually starts off in about the middle of the story and that might turn a few readers off, because it is a little disconcerting to not start off with setting and character descriptions. If you can adjust to that, I think you will really like this story. I have read the entire series and I really hated to finish this one, knowing it will be some time before another one comes out. I miss Reacher already.

B002N2XHXU|5.0|In Ismael Beah's memoir A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier, he retells his story of the war in Sierra Leone, from experiencing it as a victim and child soldier, to undergoing rehabilitation.  The memoir truly captivates his firsthand experiences from the perspective of a victim of war, and tells of the new generation of war using child soldiers.  Personally, I can relate to this book because after rehabilitation, he goes on to advocate for child soldiers, attempting to bring about change in the world, something that I strive to do throughout my day in my own small ways.    The events he and others endured at a very young age really touches me, as he is only  twelve when inducted into the army.  However, like many other young children, he doesn't realize the gravity of this situation, but instead, he notices that \\"some people got Adidas, and others Nikes.  I got a black Reebok Pump and was happier about my new crapes than anything else that was going on\\" (110).  His excitement over his new shoes prevents him from realizing that he is now in the army.  Beah is taught through brutal training that \\"if anyone starts any funny business, shoot him\\" (123).  Later, he realizes after fighting that he almost died after noticing that \\"the bruises were from bullets [...]. I was too drugged and traumatized to realize the danger\\" (151).    I feel that Beah's vivid descriptions recapture his army experiences.  During a raid, they \\"[...] waited.  It was between evening and nighttime.  One lonely cricket tried to start singing, but none of its companions joined in, so it stopped to let silence bring night. [...] Crabs had already begun feasting on the eyes of the dead.  Limbs and fragmented skulls lay on top of the bog, and the water in the swamp had been replaced by blood\\" (119).  His detailed syntax aids in telling his experiences in the army.      Thus, I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you are one who has a few hours of free time and want to truly understand the new generation of war.  Ismael Beah's account displays that modern warfare truly has no boundaries, as it definitely tugs at the heartstrings that thousands of children are losing their innocence to the atrocities of war, even as I write this.

B000NY12LO|5.0|About 2 years ago I swore off Jodi Picoult books because she tends to jack with my emotions more than I'd prefer but I kept coming back to this one and wanting to read it. I sent the sample to my Kindle and I was hooked. True to form, Jodi grabs you with these characters and keeps you hanging on to where you cannot put down the book. She does tend to get a little 'wordy' with some things that didn't interest me so I skimmed over it (the economics of happiness equations) but you will find yourself wanting to jump in the book and shake the two main characters (Josie and Patrick) but I think their teenage personalities are well portrayed. I say read it! You won't be sorry! Jodi has a way of working in characters from other novels so if you've read anything by her previously--don't be surprised to find at least one of the characters in any of her books but if you haven't, she gives you a brief review of who they are. Great book!
1594484805|2.0|It's almost to the point where there should be a boiler plate for this type of book:  a. Set up a premise in a way that the reader will assume it's true.  b. claim there's new research claiming its not true.  c. explain how its some quirk of evolution {insert saber tooth tiger reference here - by the way, does any one, anywhere have any clear evidence that early man fled from saber tooth tigers?? - everyone uses this as an analogy but i have never heard any actual evidence that this occurred} .. or trait that evolved on the African savannah (never mind the increasing amount of research that indicates humans evolved elsewhere..  d. refer to Rosa Parks or some other civil right era event as the defining moment in history  e. tell how you can do it, title the chapter the \\"Zen\\" of whatever... (funny how all this wisdom only resides in the east eh? Or is it maybe a big no no to cite a Franciscan monk or some other western Christian?)   f.provide a pep talk and implausible examples of the new theory in action.   Like Malcolm Gladwell, the \\"made to stick\\" guys, Richard Florida, Daneil Pink does not write  what's true. The reason he's so widely promoted and quoted is he supports what the current establishment  need people to believe it's true. That's also why his books (and the other cited  are shallow and filled with cherry picked research.  It's feel good fluff. like TED talks.  It meant to re-enforce not challenge, conventional thinking.    There are some good examples of how monetary incentives can actually backfire, and how intrinsic motivation is a more powerful motivator, but there's enough material here for perhaps an article, which is probably why close to 40% of this book is appendix.
B0058WFO06|5.0|I'm an avid Steven Wilson fan, having bought everything he's released with Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, and No-Man. His first solo release, [[ASIN:B001O2ZW1A Insurgentes (CD & DVD)]], was my favorite album of 2009. I didn't think Steven could top that, but with Grace For Drowning he definitely has. In these days of single tune purchases, it is so refreshing for an artist to create an album of songs that are meant to be heard as an organic whole. Since Amazon delivered GFD to me a week ago, I have been listening to it constantly.<br /><br />What works for me is to approach it as two separate albums. The first volume, Deform to Form a Star, is the more song-oriented, two of which (\\"Deform to Form a Star\\" & \\"Postcard\\") are among the most beautiful melodies Steven has composed in his prolific career. \\"Deform to Form a Star\\" begins with a very simple piano motif and slowly adds elements (vocals, clarinet, drums, mellotron). It features a couple of outstanding guitar solos from Steven: the  first is relaxed, understated, with not a single wasted note, while the second is a brief and furious bit of distortion that leads into, I kid you not, some gorgeous vocal harmonies that wouldn't be out of place on the Beach Boys \\"Surf's Up\\". It's a stunning song, production-wise. Another track, \\"Sectarian\\", reminded me quite a bit of Starless & Bible Black-era King Crimson which shouldn't have surprised me, given that KC has just rereleased that album with a 5.1 surround mix done by Steven! Another KC connection is that the former bassist, Tony Levin, adds his distinctive style to a couple of tracks, while the current KC rhythm section, Pat Mastelotto & Trey Gunn, play on two others.<br /><br />The second volume, Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye, is the more challenging. It contains the magnum opus \\"Raider II\\". At first, I thought it could have benefited from some editing, but after listening to it several times, it now strikes me as a real success. There are very few rock compositions longer than 12 minutes that I can listen to without looking at the clock; \\"Raider II\\" holds my interest throughout its entire 23:20 length. Once again, there is a strong Starless-era King Crimson influence, as well as In a Silent Way-era Miles Davis. After all the complex prog-rock, GFD closes with \\"Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye\\", a deceptively bluesy tune that leaves the listener wanting more. Quite an achievement for a double album!<br /><br />I know it's a cliche, but you really need to listen to Grace For Drowning from start to finish several times before its full beauty unfolds before you. The reward is worth the investment in time.minutes that I can listen to without looking at the clock; \\"Raider II\\" holds my interest throughout its entire 23:20 length.

B000054OTY|3.0|I purchased this movie for my husband as he is an avid fan of old western movies.  This one was somewhat of a  disappointment as it moves very very slow.
B005IS565S|5.0|First off, I was heading into this expecting an album equal to if not greater than both of the band's first 2 studio releases.  American Capitalist sets the bar high and blew all of my expectations out of the water.  The sheer intensity and meaning behind the songs gives the record so much power.  The title track and Under and Over It will quickly become a rock anthem you'll be chanting and going back and forth in duets with your friends for months to come.  The Pride is amazing; heavy meanings in the lyrics and the way the music goes together make it one of my personal favorites.  Coming Down mellows the pace down a little but still packs a lyrical punch.  Menace kicks it back up and is reminiscent of Way of the Fist and Ashes from 5FDP's previous record.  Generation Dead gives another cynical-ish view on the world today and shows the plight of what we all deal with.  Oh hey, another rock anthem!  Back For More brings it back up to a heavy metal-stadium crushing anthem.  Now we come to Remember Everything.  I can openly admit, as an 18 yr. old guy, this song will make you feel so many emotions.  Ivan's feelings he puts into singing make it feel as though it is happening to you, and you might even feel like crying.  This is one of the saddest songs, if not the saddest.  Wicked Ways tells about the dirty tactics someone has used on Ivan in his lifetime.  Lastly is 100 Ways to Hate.  A song devoted to telling someone how and why you hate them.  One giant, amazing rant.  One of the best albums I have ever purchased.  Each song is amazing, and I can't point out any negative to any of them.  This album deserves it's #1 spot in Heavy Metal sales.  Worth every penny for the purchase, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.

1897093616|5.0|Why I waited until now to read this great book I don't know. I've been reading a lot of classics lately and I'm glad I decided to read this one. I read the Kindle version and loved it. This is one that my homeschooled son is going to read this year and I'm looking forward to discussing it with him. It has adventure, suspense, surprise twists and turns - everything you expect in a great book. One of the reviewers mentioned that some of the negative reviews for this book might be because a student was forced to read it for school. He said that if a student is forced to read something then they will probably hate it. I disagree. My son has read a lot of books for school and loved most of them. If you create a love for books when a child is young then he will grow up with an appreciation of great books. This is one of those great books. I will agree with one thing that the reviewer said however. Don't force your child to read it....READ IT WITH HIM! Read it to him. Read it as a family. I think they will agree that it is worth five stars as well.
0307888681|2.0|I bought this book because I like zombies.  I like thrillers and thought it would be a good book-especially with hearing so many positive reviews.  4 1/2 stars from 900 some people-it must be good!  I keep putting it down and just not picking it back up though.  It just isn't holding my interest at all.  I have had the book about a month and still haven't finished it.    The book takes place after the zombies have taken over the world and were supposedly defeated by humans.  The world is very different now.  There are a series of short 'interviews' by those who lived through it all and have a story to tell.  The stories by themselves are ok and entertaining, interesting.  But you have to start over every story from the beginning-set up the story, scene, characters, etc.  It's very hard to have to do this over and over and over and over again.

0937381888|5.0|The author gives step by step instructions spiced up with the scietific reasons why.  He obviously has a firm grasp of all the biological interactions happening within a brewing process.  He carefully points out how missteps can affect the taste of the final product.  The book is fine as a straight through read for an interested first time brewer; as well as being a great reference for developing your understanding after your first few batches. The science does not get in the way of the basic simplicity of brewing beers.  There are recipes for various types of beer, as well as reference tables and materials lists. The author obviously has a good sense of humor, and does a fine job of making the drier topics and safety considerations both interesting and memorable. I first found this book by \\"accident\\" while killing time in a Boise Library. The half hour I spent getting started were good enough to send me to Amazon for ordering my own copy when I got home.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Bob Dylan and Terence Malick -- you either like them or you don't.  I wonder what they think of one another.  Like Dylan, Malick is more into rhythm than rhyme, and more into tone than staying on key.  Some people say about Malick's movies, \\"I like them because they make me think.\\"  I get that.  But like Malick's movies because they make me \\"think and feel at the same time\\" ... kind of like what happens when I read Flannery O'Connor, T.S. Eliot, or Anne Lamott.  \\"Tree of Life\\" works for me as a film (and I predict it will become a classic), not simply because it hands me a new pair of glasses with which to look at faith, and death, and life through ... but because through sight, sound, and intentional pacing, it introduces me to the heart and soul of a family that it didn't take long for me to relate to or believe could be real, and in a narrative, \\"point-of-view\\" way it lets me glimpse their journey of becoming human while experiencing not only the pain and loss of original sin, but the healing and gain of original blessing.  Godspeed.  read.think.pray.live.  Gregg Lamm  Newberg, OR

B0033H7VI6|5.0|this is a great knife! I read all the reviews and watched all the videos I could find on it before deciding to get it. I ended up ordering two. the edges of both needed a little help but I expected that. The edge holds up very well to chopping tasks.I hacked some pretty thick citrus branches in my backyard and it was still very sharp afterwards. I'm looking forward to putting these knives to some field testing on some upcoming deer and elk hunts. I did dress one of the knives up with a kydex sheath I made, a firesteel and holder, and some paracord.For the price I don't think you can go wrong. I really want a[[ASIN:B001N1DPDE Ka-Bar Becker BK2 Campanion Fixed Blade Knife]]to do a side by side comparison with. Anyway, I'll be putting some abuse on this knife and I'll add to this review after testing... But as of right now I'd say go get one for yourself!!! oh yeah... check the pictures I added of the new sheath!
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I have to start by saying I am rounding the corner to 50 years old and the last pop album I bought was about two years ago (although I think the classification of this as a modern R&B album is appropriate). That said, good music is good music and this is about as good as I've heard in a long long time. Adele is a remarkable talent, and the album is full of great songs. Time will tell if this will be one of those timeless classics, but based on what I'm hearing, this sounds like one to me. Restores my faith in popular music.

0385534639|5.0|I have to say that for this being a first time writer, Erin Morgenstern has done a wonderful job. Yes I have to agree that this is not an action filled book, like some of the reviewers before me have said, some have been dissapointed by this fact, I for one am not one of them. This book is rich in style, and flavor. It is something that I have never read before, I felt like I was there, with the characters, experiencing the most inventive circus around! Great detail, and word is that there is a movie being made of this novel, move over Water for Elephants, this is going to be an amazing film.<br />Kudos Erin, you did an excellent job on this novel.<br /><br />Christopher Berry

B000FC1AGG|4.0|This book was a cute, easy read that just satisfies your need for an occasional light-hearted happy ending.  If you've ever let a relationship drag on even though you're kind of over it, Emma's your girl & maybe a bit of inspiration. Or found yourself wondering how your life came to THIS... you'll appreciate her as well.  Since getting my Kindle, I've read so (SO) many 1st person POV's that they're getting on my nerves in a huge way (what can I say? I'm a sucker for indies/freebies and indie authors seem to be suckers for first person POV), but this one walked that line nicely with at least one decently-worked plot device that allowed us to glimpse into the minds of other characters while creating confusion for the protagonist.<br /><br />On top of that, and honestly the main reason I picked this book up - Random House, are you listening?  Good on ya for the Kindle pricing being significantly less than the mass market paperback! (YMMV - they may raise it at any time, of course. UPDATE: Yup, been increased since my purchase.:()<br /><br />It is refreshing to see a publisher realizing that we're not asking for the moon, just pricing that reflects the new realities of publishing to digital media.
B004EPZ0BQ|4.0|This is the second movie of 2011 involving 2 beautiful people agreeing to be sex buddies without any emotional entanglements.  Ashton Kushner and Natalie Portman did a decent job in \\"No Strings Attached\\" back in January.  This time we have Portman's \\"Black Swan\\" partner Mila Kunis pairing up with all around superstar Justin Timberlake.  Keep in mind, the movie is a no-brainer in every sense of the word.  We know where it's going by just watching the trailers, let alone getting into the movie.  Both characters of course has a confidant.  In Dylan's (Timberlake) case it's gay sportswriter Tommy played by Woody Harrelson.  For Jamie (Kunis), it's her former hippie mother played by Patricia Clarkson.  What makes this movie different from standard romcom fare is some excellent writing, snappy and funny dialog and generally good acting all around.  The film even makes fun of itself by not so subtlety criticizing others in the genre.  What really makes the film click are Timberlake and Kunis.  They are terrific together, especially in the sack where they take some pretty explicit behavior to a hilarious end.

0756405890|3.0|I picked up The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss because it was on a list of dark fantasy novels. This is the extremely long tale of Kvothe, a man of legend, who has settled down in a small town where he hopes to escape the many enemies he has accumulated in his short (though eventful) life. Along the way comes Chronicler, the wikipedia of his day, who wants the real story behind the many feats of the legendary Kvothe. This sets up the novel and the rest is the first person account of the legend.<br /><br />Overall: It was disappointing as dark fantasy because while the events depicted are of a grotesque nature (child rape, slaughter, extreme poverty), the language evokes nothing but Harry potter. It's like Mr. Rogers telling us a bedtime story called A Song of Ice and Fire and emitting none of the realistic details those books include.<br /><br />Characterization: Aside from Kvothe, none of the other characters are as well developed, which was disappointing since Bast and Chronicler seem to be interesting people. Part of the lack of development of the secondary and tertiary characters is that the novel spends so little time with them. The bulk of the tale is devoted to Kvothe and his life, with small characters coming in and out of it. But even characters that have more than a chapter devoted to them, like Denna and Sim, are little more than place holders and it is difficult to get a grasp on them.<br /><br />Not only that, but a lot of these characters had the feel of stock characters. There was the teacher at the school of magic that didn't like the protagonist from the get-go. There was the traditional set of friends that accompany the hero on the quest (Denna and sometimes Sim and Wil). There was the school bully who uses his money and influence to belittle and harass the hero (Ambrose). And, of course, there was the hero who loses his parents at an early age and must deal with the world on his own.<br /><br />Story: It was very brave of Patrick Rothfuss to give us this type of story, since it is very slow and with little action or magic. He did succeed in keeping me going for the length of the book and even into the second book, partly because Kvothe and his adventures are enjoyable to read and the tale is so different than the typical heroic fantasy with tons of action and death. The unfortunate thing is that I could not shake the feeling of dejavu that I got. Let's face it, after Harry Potter, the magic school idea is too familiar to ignore. Also, the world is the typical medievalesque setting of many other novels.<br /><br />Things that annoyed me:<br /><br />1) There is a pattern of characters getting hit over the head and waking up in relative safety, ala Bilbo Baggins in the Hobbit. This happens to so many characters that it felt like a cop-out and especially when it happens to Kvothe (and this is every time he is involved in an action sequence).<br /><br />2) The magic system(s) was too thoroughly described for me to see it as magical any longer. There is a general need in today's authors to describe to death the magic system they have come up with. The one in The Name of the Wind is not even original, which is why I called this review what I did. Ursula Leguin's Earthsea novels use the same system as the Naming used by Rothfuss. And the Sympathy is eerily similar to the Will and the Word of the Belgariad novels by Eddings though it has a flair of originality. Aside from that, I would have enjoyed Sympathy much more if there weren't entire chapters devoted to explaining the mechanism of it. I only need the most marginal explanation and the rest should be SHOWED!<br /><br />3) While I am on the topic of showing... I don't understand why there were so many places where the signs of the Chandrian are explained. (Blue fire = the Chandrian) is carved into your memory from the very first few pages as well as the other signs--that is not even a spoiler since it gets repeated so much. This was disappointing since thefirst encounter with the Chandrian would have moer than done the trick. I will admit that the children's rhymes were delightful and clever. If the author had stuck to just those, then it would have been masterful.<br /><br />Things that failed:<br /><br />1) This book has no climax. The action sequence in Trebon near the end would have worked beautifully if it was relevant to the story in any way. It honestly read like a token piece of action before closing the novel. Nothing that preceded this last action sequence justified it--it just happens.<br /><br />2) Luck is Kvothe's best friend. Wow. The number of times where luck saved the day is staggering and it wears on you. By the end I wanted to know if Kvothe was lying and he wasn't as lucky as he wanted us to believe or if this was just a flaw in the story.<br /><br />3) Like I said in the beginning, the tone the language produces is all wrong for a dark story. With the harsh life Kvothe has led, I expected a more bitter and angry narrative, but what you get is a happy-go-lucky guy reminiscing.<br /><br />The things that touched me:<br /><br />1) The descriptions of povery and of the main character making it from day to day were very well done. I felt the anxiety in Kvothe as he had to try to find money for school and food and rent... does that speak of today's world or what? It was a part of the novel that was all too relevant to our world today.<br /><br />2) The connection Kvothe has with Auri is also beautifully done. There is a sense of hopelessness whenever he talks about his encounters with her that I thought should have been constant throughout.<br /><br />3) The connection to music and the arts! There should have been less about the magic system and more about Kvothe and his lute, hands down. What brought the character to life for me was the way in which he relates to his music (more than a wife and a lover) and the Edema Ruh.<br /><br />Those last three items made the novel endearing and were also the reason why I wanted to read The Wise Man's Fear.<br /><br />LCll admit that the children's rhymes were delightful and clever.

0307887898|4.0|First, a rebuttal to others' reviews: Many other reviewers have suggested that the points Mr. Reis makes can be found easily by googling, and for free. What these reviewers fail to realize is that they have spent a disproportionate amount of time finding and reading related resources. For many of us, the cost of the this book is offset by not having to spend hours (and even days) searching for quality information on startup innovation (if we even know where to start searching).<br /><br />Overall this book is a good read, especially for someone that had just come from a failed startup. Much of the problems he pointed out resonated with me. The emphasis on testing the RISKIEST assumptions of a startup first is refreshing, and leads me to thinking about my next startup in a different light. The basic idea behind the lean startup is to apply the scientific method to a startup. And in a startup, like science, we are unsure what the end result holds, and that is why we test. However, unlike science, whereby some research spans decades, a startup must test assumptions and iterate quickly to avoid running out of cash.<br /><br />That said, one of the major annoyances reading this book, and the reason I knocked it down a star, is that he fails to provide solid evidence of his methodology working in reality. Most examples come off as \\"company X's product would've done better had they applied lean thinking\\" but without any real basis for this assertion. When I put down the book, I cautiously agreed with much of what he said...cautiously because it's not clear that the lean methodology is both universally practical and helpful.

Thankfully, I held out to her conclusion where it came together for me that her illness came from the hostility she directed inward. I tend to be slow at picking these things up.

The good structure and wonderful writing voice made this a read I will definately recommend.

030788743X|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone over 40 who looks back and realizes how much money and time they wasted (and continue to \\"waste\\") on videogames and silly popular culture during their lives.  The author engages us on the first page - and the action doesn't stop.  Our hero relies upon his knowledge of the popular culture of our generation (those of us aged 40-50 or so) to solve a mystery in a game that appears harmless but has been transformed into a life or death struggle for players.<br /><br />Imagine if World of Warcraft had a billion-dollar prize hidden somewhere in the digital WoW world - and the prize would also give you the power to control that world as well.  That's the premise of this book set in about 2040(?) or so.  The world that's described is entirely plausible, a simple extrapolation of several key aspects of society give us a world where a huge majority of people spend their time in a digital simulation, some spending nearly every waking hour in an online world.<br /><br />The author does a good job of connecting both the virtual and the physical world without relying on too many implausible \\"maguffins\\" to get in the way of a story that is both heartwarming as well as engaging.  I have no idea if younger people will find the D&D and ancient video game references overbearing - I found the explanations perfectly adequate without going overboard, but of course I know exactly what he is talking about, so consult a younger reviewer regarding that.<br /><br />In the end, this book brought back some great memories and was also a really good story.  I recommend it for anyone.

0439023513|5.0|If whoever is reading this and hasn't read the first two books, I don't know what you are doing here.   But for all those that have, well, Mrs. Suzanne Collins made a brilliant way to end the trilogy.  Throughout the book I felt that Katniss' life couldn't be anymore difficult and horrible.  Once when I thought that, I did.  Collins kept me on the edge of my bed and I couldn't stop myself from not reading it.  I spent many nights reading page after page. This is why:   Katniss through the whole series faced difficult problems with the Hunger Games, the romantic relationships between Gale and Peeta, the fight within to decide if she was just a figure playing the Capitol's games.  First of all, the Hunger Games.  This topic includes everything that relates to it; President Snow, the deaths of everyone that she loves and/or cares about.  President Snow got her a guilt trip and threat of killing her sister, mother, Gale, and Peeta if she doesn't do anything about stopping the uprising that is happening throughout the districts.  And it just so happens that he likes to kill people just to show what the Capitol can do.(the Hunger Games, killing all the victors, all the fashion people for the victors, which sadly includes Cinna.  All this made her uneasy and had her go in crazed obsession and nightmares.  Her romantic relationships between Gale and Peeta also happened to, well, harshly stress her out.  She didn't want to lose both men, and with President Snow on her heels, desperately tries to save both of them. (She almost failed saving Peeta from the Capitol and the hijacking that made him completely mad with hate for her and made him dillusional.    And her fight from within.  With all this going on, she was/is at war.  All along the story she is deciding how to change herself so that she isn't a \\"pawn\\" for the Capitol or District 13.  She finds that no matter what, in desperate measures people do desperate things and in these desperate measures, people betray and maketheir own plans just so they come out on top.  Throughout the book she must decide Friend? or Foe?  Trustworthy? or Enemy?  With all this story line, Suzanne Collins beautifully crafted a brilliant ending to a brilliant trilogy.  When I finished I was thinking this, \\"Isn't it a bummer that the trilogy had to end?\\"  I was soooooooo ready for more!

B000S0GYRU|1.0|Just saw this movie...I have to cast my lot with the majority of the lower ranking reviews here. After hearing so much hype about this movie I was hoping for something MUCH better. The opening \\"murder\\" is kind of interesting (not really scary) but I don't understand how it jumped from a bathroom window with a hairy creature's arm to a stabbing scene to a hanging scene. Tacky and nonsensical, but probably the best scene of the film because it was unique. It all goes downhill from there at a nightmarishly sluggish pace.<br /><br />Lets talk about the only features that make this film stand out: the colors are neon sickly sweet, blood the color of bright caugh syrup. The music is GRATING and annoying (I think it was meant to be this way, but I loathed it for the most part)...I suppose it DID work in one scene with the \\"barbed wire/slinky\\" I thought that was quite effective and the music added to that ONE scene, but overall rediculous interjections of a hissing \\"witch\\" and weird instumentalization does NOT an atmosphere make. The sets are just strange, somewhat \\"carnivalesque\\". These total effects do remind one of a nightmare (the scene with the barbed wire/slinky in particular), because it is strange and surreal and your trying to escape but your trapped. I get it.<br /><br />Overall though, this movie just left a foul taste in my mouth. While it can earn some points for its uniqueness and somewhat artistic value, it is devoid of substance and coherance. The last ten minutes of the movie were ABYSMAL! The massive plot revelation was hokey to say the least and while it was meant to be scary it just made me raise my eyebrows and shake my head.  The story and plot are lacklaster, the characters are empty shallow shells which we never learn anything about, plot lines are introduced (like a possible romance) only to never pick up or go anywhere again. And don't even get me started on the BAT scene. That was one of the most loathsome and absurdly rediculous scenes I've ever witnessed. A one year old wouldn't be scared of that bat! How this all ties to witches, witchcraft or the occult is ANYONE'S guess. The motivations for all characters involved are never fully explained other than that of the herione who just wants to figure out why people are going missing and then get the hell out with her life. Flat, dull, empty.<br /><br />Overall, Suspiria is a massive failure to me. A unique use of color and some surreal sets does not make up for the total failure of this film on nearly every other level. Compared to other movies of the time like Halloween, The exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien this film is pathetic!r old wouldn't be scared of that bat!

If you are on the cusp of starting the Maze Runner Trilogy, or this last book, dont hesitate. It's a quick read/page turner.  Yes, there are questions left unanswered, but life is sort of like that.

There wasnt 1 empty seat.Judging by the audiences reactions, everybody thoroughly loved this film.I have always liked the band, although not a die hard fan. This documentary is extremely well done , no surprise given the fact that Cameron Crowe is behind it. Nice mix of interesting dialoge and live footage. Also , quite a bit of humour. A fitting tribute in the 15-20 mins spent on Mother Love Bone and Andrew Wood . As well as Temple of the dog and comments from Chris Cornell. Just an excellent 2 hrs spent. Any moderate fan will really love this doc. I am looking forward to watching on dvd and hopefully seeing some extras too.

The rules are easy to follow along with in a concise step by step layout and i had no trouble really finding everything i was looking for. While i'm finding there is an awful lot of info to digest in this book, it has everything a game player and game master need to get started, outside of a monster book.<br />I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone wanting to stick to 3.5'ish rules or if you have never really ventured into role playing games much, this is a great place to start.<br /><br />I had played 2nd edition dungeons and dragons way back in my teenage years and had recently picked up the 4th edition of d&d and felt it was quite a far cry from the d&d style i grew up enjoying, so after a lot of reading  & research, i stumbled onto this game, which is from what i gather, an evolution of d&d 3.5.  All i know is d&d 4th edition sucked compared to this game.  I have found so much more detail in this system rule book and it doesn't feel like i'm playing a pen and paper version of world of warcraft like 4th edition did.

B0055EAJ7A|1.0|I have 16 3D Blu Ray titles in my library, including several purchased from Amazon.com.  THOR is the only 3D that refuses to play on my equipment.  This is a 3 disc set and the Blu Ray and DVD play as expected.
B005R32L66|4.0|Brand new to Skype, but I was able to launch a chat with video on the HTC Sensation very easily. Don't see any problems so far. Would be nice to see status of contacts whether they're logged into Skype before launching it, but maybe that is possible and I need to keep using and learning.
0385534639|5.0|Ms. Morgenstern has a magical way with words. She has conjured a tale composed of myth, illusion, mystery and romance that will beguile, bewitch and bemuse all but the most jaded reader.
B005HXGE9G|3.0|While the album is not a complete washout, I don't find it particularly inspiring or challenging. The orchestrations are reminiscent of mid-level movie music. I'm a big fan of orchestral film scores, and frankly find any of Zimmer's 'Pirates' scores, Giacchino's 'Up' or 'Star Trek,' and Desplat's 'Deathly Hallows Vol. 1' (to mention a few recent ones) more satisfying than this. Gabriel himself has done better in the genre with 'Passion' and 'Birdy.' Pleasant, middlebrow NPR stuff, but no more. Could be that, once again, pop tunes (even ambitious ones like Gabriel's) just aren't strong enough to prop up classical pretensions.
B00466HN86|5.0|Truly enjoyed the movie when I went to see it in the theater. It is a must see movie for everyone.It had a strong impact,on real issues of today. It left you really taking inventory as a human the way we need to be as christians, to stand even if it mean you stand alone. I want to have this in my library for home. Can't wait to share it with others.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I have nothing but great experiences with my purchases through Amazon. This DVD came quickly and the price was great!  We love this performance and will enjoy it for many years to come.  Laura Bradley
B005C5A6C0|5.0|I have been following Machine Head since their inception and really have not really been a fan, but I could listen and enjoy a few of their songs.  However with this album, XM started to play it months before it's release and it really stuck with me.  I purchased it the day it came out and have listened to it several times through and really think it's one of the most solid albums out there this year, and in the past several years. It is right there this year in quality with Anthrax's Worship Music.  This album has the heaviness you expect on songs like Locust, This is The End, and Pearls Before The Swine, but also has longer intro's that set the mood for the songs and set a fair melody. There are plenty of excelent guitar solos, and thrash pit turning speed between the slow endings and intros that this album would be good to work out too.  All the songs clock in between 5 and 8 minutes each, and that is why there are only 7 tracks on the standard album, and 10 on the bonus CD/DVD edition. There is a bit of synthesizer overtone on many of the songs that I feel isn't overdone, and I really like that in Who We Are where Rob Flynn actually has a choir behind him singing in which his two sons and other band member's children are singing.  I think that's a pretty cool thing for him and the rest of the band to be able to do after all these years of working hard to bring us great music. They feel comfortable enough to experiment like that and to share that part of their lives with us, as well as keep metal alive for with a new generation. I think this is a great way to introduce new fans to Machine Head, and also will be well received by old fans.  I think this is a must have if you are a metal fan and want to keep you collection fresh.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|Guess I just didn't get it along with my wife. I love these types of movies, ended up being bored to tears.  No action, even less of a story and predictable as can be. Sorry but it sucked!

B0058VW36U|5.0|best f'n game on any handheld device! i beat the game.  it has 200 levels and more are coming with an update.  i honestly would $10 for this game and im a hardcore pc and console gamer (not casual).  top notch!  if i had to make one complaint it would be order of difficulty, the levels dont get progressively harder, its kinda random.
0345529057|5.0|The HBO series is fantastic and I've been saving up to buy this set. There's been so many good books already this year I had to wait a little while. Glad to finally dive in! I'll be ready for the next season too.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|This movie is on the top of my list, the story was fasted pace and it didn't leave you unexcited what was going to happen next. The movie never got too hard to explain with all these sifi movies out there that you don't understand what the plot is.<br />Overall it was an interesting movie that i would recommend to any one who enjoys thinking out side the box.
0385738773|3.0|After the first two books in this series, i had fairly high expectations of Mr. Dashner's writing. Maybe he just got tired of writing this series, or had other projects on his table, or maybe the fault lies entirely with his editing staff, but regardless, this book had numerous glaring errors. For example, he gets the meanings of 'captive' and 'captor' mixed up, using each where he should have used the other. And fear not, the errors aren't just linguistic. When four of the protagonists get rounded up by six antagonists, Thomas notes that the odds are fair, six to six.<br /><br />The plot doesn't fare much better. This series, like many before it (i'm thinking Alias, X-Files, and so on) got so wound up in countless double-crosses, betrayals, and misunderstandings that after a certain point it's all noise. Thomas starts just trusting his gut on whom to believe, but that leaves the reader out of the loop entirely.<br /><br />Confounding that is how darn credulous Thomas and his friends are at times. He and his merry band go looking for someone they've heard, from a dubious source, may be able to help them. Almost immediately after, word gets to them that WICKED has put a bounty on that person's head. Never once does one character turn to another and say, \\"Hey, if i were WICKED, i'd do exactly these things to lure us into a trap.\\"<br /><br />What Dashner fails to include in the way of character development or answers to long-standing questions, he makes up for with nearly non-stop action. It's convenient, really, how many poor decisions the characters make, because if they'd acted like the best of the best, the fastest and smartest, they probably could have gotten everything done much more safely and easily.<br /><br />And the end of the book, the reader is offered a tiny tidbit of information to tie up one loose end, but in all, very few questions are answered. If you've read through [[ASIN:B004Z4LVZK The Maze Runner]] and [[ASIN:0385738765 The Scorch Trials]] expecting the third book to actually explain anything at all, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />However, if you just want stories of a group of young people trying to survive in a world looking more and more like a slow-motion zombie apocalypse, this'll do just fine.nything at all, you'll be sorely disappointed.  However, if you just want stories of a group of young people trying to survive in a world looking more and more like a slow-motion zombie apocalypse, this'll do just fine.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|What can you say about this, it's the Wilburys. Regardless of how they got together, fortunately for us mere mortals, they did. The tracks on this album go from good to gooder to goodest (I know - grammar). Anyone who digs good ol' rock-'n-roll will like this album. The fact that these tracks, without exception, sound so simple, attests to the mastery of the participants.
1442419814|4.0|I am an 8th Grade student who was intrigued by the topic of the Uglies - every sixteen year old getting the chance to become super model gorgeous on their birthday and put in to a paradise of fun and games. I was convinced by my friend to read the book and I am glad that I did. It was a great read and I could hardly put it down. A few parts were a little slow but for the most part it was an exciting read. You follow Tally through every decision she makes after being turned down for the operation because her friend Shay has run away.  Scott Westerfeld does a great job with scene setting, character descriptions, and describing a believable future. I would like to read the whole series soon. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves creative story lines and exciting twists.
B005IFWXWU|4.0|OK, so Hugh doesn't have the best voice, but it really doesn't distract from some really excellent music.  Great song selection, excellent piano by Hugh, with creative arrangements, outstanding vocalist join him, and a truly wonderful group of musicians round it out.  I enjoy the whole thing.
0240810554|3.0|I was hoping for a book that would explain the various effects of different ways of developing film, or the impact of different developers.  For example, what is the impact of developing at higher temperatures and shorter times (or vice versa).... or what is the difference in results between different developers?   The book centers more on how to mimic common developers by combining various chemicals and household products. A bottle of HC-110 is really quite cheap given how much film it could develop. A bottle of  HC-110 (64 oz) costs $12.50 and has enough liquid to develop 256 rolls at Dillution H. That is less than 5 cents per roll.  If I go through the effort to make my own, am I really going to save much money?
B000002H97|1.0|Go ahead and rip me...unlike the majority of the lunkheads that are of the opinion that this is Metallica's 'best album,' this is the cd that finally caused me to throw up my hands in disgust; why, oh WHY does every band I truly love let me down sooner or later, recording something so hideously WRONG? Let's see...Metallica...METALlica...Metallica=thrash...thrash album(s)...from what I remember reading, 'Metal'lica noticed something 'wrong' while touring for 'And Justice For All' - it seems like the simpletons in the crowd just couldn't 'get into' all the intricate time changes going on in some of their newer songs...in other words, no mindless headbanging for mindless cretins.  To hell with experimentation, we say! Let's 'get into a groooooooooove.' WAKE UP, MORONS! You are a THRASH band!!!!...I should've noticed something was starting to stink around the time radio stations picked up on 'Welcome Home' - yep, another radio-ready mid tempo song that predated this pile of grotesque garbage by a few years.  As for 'One,' if I hear that damn song one more time, I will go on a multi-state killing spree...but golly, if it weren't for those 2 wastes of time, we wouldn't have 'The Black Album' to rip apart, would we?  And it really pains me to rip Metallica, since I was there from the beginning; I found their 1st lp on vinyl (on Megaforce, before they signed to Elektra) and bought it without even hearing a note beforehand...the band name sounded cool, the song titles sounded like something I would enjoy, and the band was ugly as hell.  Cool! Brought it home and my jaw dropped...I became the local metal hero at my high school, believe me.  Brutal riffs, incredible time changes...thinking-man's thrash! Excellent!!! And then, little by little, things began to go awry...it became truly evident after the sad and unfortunate death of bassist Cliff Burton - with his tragic passing, Metallica started to slip into realms of reek...acoustic ballads? What's this crap??? I want 'Whiplash,' dammit! This album marked the end of an era for me; I have not bought a single solitary Metallica cd since (and I will never do so again)...I don't own anything from them between this piece of s**t and 'Death Magnetic' (which is a promising cd...but I'm really scared of their 'Lulu' cd...even the name suggests another pile of crap...maybe they should've named it Doodoo' instead...) - NOW, here's the thing about this album that kinda sticks in my craw.  Overall, as a complete body of work, is the music on this cd 'bad'?  No...as a 'corporate hard rock/metal' album, it has its moments.  'Enter Sandman' is a pretty cool song, and so is 'Through The Never.'  That being said, as a METALLICA album it fails on all counts.  If their desire was to become a foppish MTV band, they succeeded; never mind that you'll be puking all over your hardcore fans; the ones that supported you from the start, that loved songs like 'Trapped Under Ice,' 'Disposable Heroes' and 'Hit The Lights.'  THRASH fans.  Bottom line: if this album was recorded by ANYONE else, I'd probably love it, or at least LIKE it.  Since it was recorded by Metallica, a band I once held in reverence for being the epitome of thrash, I absolutely DESPISE it.  Hope you guys are happy now, since it seems like a gazillion people can finally headbang in unison at one of your shows...bunch of damn sell-outs.  Shame on Metallica for this utter piece of rubbish.
1563894696|4.0|A lengthy & complex exploration of several events, families, themes, and motives that propel powerful men & women to try to run the world according to their own terms, resulting in death & devastation, but perhaps not entirely without merit. This graphic novel finds Bruce Wayne immediately after the events described in \\"Year One\\", with the biggest criminal families of Gotham trying to settle their rivalries once & for all, and amidst all these there is a spate of \\"holiday killings\\" which affect members of both sides without much hesitation. Usual suspects get skewered (by analysis, as well as other sharper instruments), and with a tremendous twist in the tail/tale the novel inverts a lot of presuppositions at the last frame. Recommended as a gripping thriller and a novel, nothing less.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|When I saw this movie at the movies, I couldn't wait until it came out on DVD soi mthat I could watch whenever I want to.  My merchandise arrived earlier than expected and in new and excellent condition. I would definitely transact business with this seller again.

1401207529|5.0|Undoubtedly inferior compared to \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\", but even then deserving nothing less than 5 stars in my humble opinion. Perhaps the origin of the \\"Batman Begins\\" storyline can be more closely linked to the events portrayed in this novel (again, nothing less than this weighty word should be used to describe this piece of work), but this novel is more special in terms of giving us the second most admirable character in the entire franchise. I am not talking about Alfred, but the loyal and honest, fallible-yet-brave Police Officer Gordon. This is the book where you watch Bruce Wayne take his first steps from being a cub to becoming a Panther, but this book also shows how a mortal man can keep his head high amidst all that is going against him, including his own loneliness. No, nothing less than 5 stars would do, and vehemently recommended.
0545123291|4.0|Linger was a bit slow-going at first, but once I sat down and read for a good, solid hour or two, I couldn't put it down. It definitely picks up and gets extremely exciting in the last 100 pages or so. When you get close to the end, I recommend having Forever, the next book in the series, close by. When I finished Linger, I literally ran to grab the copy of Forever that I had waiting. It definitely is a great book, and if you liked Shiver, you'll love Linger.
0385474547|5.0|This book changed my life, and revised the way I think about the narrative form of book-writing. Every time I've read it (three times total) I find myself slowly becoming incorporated and indoctrinated into a foreign culture that at first seems so inscrutable. By the end, Achebe sets up a heartbreaking irony -- as the tribe becomes colonized, the familiar is now strange, the strange now familiar. And instead of feeling distance from a culture that was at first so alienating, you are now among them. Achebe's prose is so carefully crafted that every sentence was, to me, perfect. Read this book, keep an open mind, and you will be changed.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Biophilia is like a haunting sonic exploration from an alien perspective. Waves upon waves of musical landscapes are explored from the thorough mind of Bj&ouml;rk. I think this is a contender for one of the best albums of 2011. All tracks are best listened in its whole entirety. Dissecting each tracks will disrupts the whole ambience beauty of this presentation. It is so delightful to discover amazing musical sounds that resonates from the strangest of instruments. Every listens open up a new chapter, there is no end to it. I just am truly in awe with her creativity, I can't describe it more in written words. Bravo Bj&ouml;rk!
0810989956|5.0|very good book for my 3rd grade son. He likes it very much.If there are more books cab be shipped at once. it will be better. Because the shipping fee is pretty expensive comparing to the book itself price.
0545259088|4.0|Forever ended the Wolves of Mercy Falls series very well. This book was my favorite in the entire series. I wouldn't be able to come up with a better conclusion if I tried myself. It closed up everything and tied up all of the loose ends left. Everything connected in the end. throughout the book, I kept thinking I knew the answer to one of the many mysteries, and then new evidence showed up and it totally turned around my prediction. It's the perfect finish to a great series.
0316056863|4.0|Bossypants reads like one long, hilarious standup routine, or a monologue that you shouldn't take too seriously. If you're into memoirs of this sort (style over substance) I would absolutely recommend you read this book. I literally laughed out loud several times, and could picture Ms. Fey delivering certain lines with your trademark dryness, with a slight smirk. There's also lots of great stuff about her rise to SNL, about her love of improv, her dealings with comedy bigwigs, her feeling like a fish-out-of-water, to this day, when it comes to glamour photoshoots. If there's one criticism I would give the book, it's that I finished it without really knowing who Tiny Fey was. Every time she recounted something, I didn't feel like i was *really* there, with her, and I think her writing is very guarded. She didn't want to seem vulnerable. Again, this is great for some readers, and in the end I still thought it was a super amazing books. Four stars!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a great book.  Nicholas Sparks is amazing as always.  You can relate this to real life as I am sure many people live there lives always looking behind them.  Love how it ended.
B000WC3864|5.0|this set, in addition to the book of the dead edition, will provide all the bonus features and info anyone could ever need about this movie. anchor bay went overboard re-re-releasing this series of films over the years and seemingly it has come to an end with this set. i have really enjoyed the new documentary about the making of the film and the picture quality is great considering  how old this movie is.(i watched it upscaled to 1080p on a bluray player)
B0055JP7EU|5.0|I have been following the Doctor Who series since its revival a couple of years ago.  The stories are what kept me engaged all this time.  It is heart warming and weird at the same time.  There amazing thing is that you don't see the surprises coming at all and while it answers some questions, it creates others.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|Well made. Enough room for my Leather Surge and all the 40 extra bit drivers. A detachable belt clip would have been nice, but good enough. The leather case that came with the Surge was ugly, so I had to buy this nylon case. Happy with my purchase.
030788743X|5.0|Just a wonderful romp through a dystopian future and a nostalgic past.  It's a fun page-turner I couldn't wait to get to the next page.  I love books like this.  It had enough gravity to keep me engaged with the characters and their plight, an antagonist who was selfish enough to be hated but not a stereotype to be merely loathed and disbelieved.  All without getting too bogged down in SERIOUS MATTERS to stop being fun.   It's not great literature, but it was the most enjoyable book I've read since Daniel Suarez' Freedom (tm).
B005ELQVGW|5.0|Bjork latest record only proves once again how she is capable to create extraordinary  music by setting her own terms while doing it. \\"Biophilia\\" is an exquisite organic album with some samplers here and there that just decorates the whole body that this record shows. Personally, I found songs like \\"Crystalline\\" and \\"Cosmonogy\\" and \\"Virus\\" beautiful, intrigue songs that takes you on a trip. On the other hand, \\"Hollow\\" is the weirdest track Bjork has ever released. The strings arrangements seem to be describing a cartoon scene from the 40's or 50's. I found that particular song hard to get but for some reason I was curious about it. \\"Moon\\" and \\"Thunderbolt\\" really get me. These are the kind of songs that you don't seem to like but when you listen to it more than once, you can't leave them later. It's no surprise at all that singers like Bjork comes up with this record where there are no cliches, there are no catchy tunes, where she makes her own instruments to create the sounds you listen here. This is a singer that has always been where anyone has been before (maybe PJ Harvey and Tori Amos could be her matches) and yet, no one has been able to meet her in the place she's nowadays (probably Radiohead's Thom Yorke and John Greenwood can see her in the distance but still... they are different).<br /><br />I really appreciate that records like these are produced in these days where the music seems to sound tainted and hollow by the whole mighty money if you know what I mean. Bjork is one of the very FEW singers and bands nowadays that gives music what I like to call IDENTITY.

0316096199|5.0|Although I received this book from my mother in law, I would have eventually read it since I LOVED Lovely Bones by Sebold.  I was entralled from the first paragraph and description of the rape and finished the book in three days (245 pages!).  Thankfully I have not went through this experience myself but have way too many friends who have and its great to see their thinking process and helps to know eventually if it happened to someone close to me again the things they may or may not want you to do and say in the situation.  The book is a true story so although I felt at times Alice wasn't dealing with the issues that were brought up, that's what happens in real life and its not always easy to move on.  Her adult life eventually reached some good times and she obviously becamse a gifted writer in life.  Overall I would say if you are a woman - READ THIS BOOK.  LOVED IT.

0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is probably my favorite book of all time. All the action, adventure, and drama that went throughout the book just wanted me to turn off the T.V. and start reading the novel. The best parts of the book were when they started back in the games. All that just made me continue on reading by all the thrilling parts of such a brilliant story. Thank you Suzanne Collins for making me more into reading and less into mind killing television. The book does include a very shocking ending that you may know but, not trying to spoil it for the others. I would recommend this to people that love the Hunger Games series or just love books that include action and adventure which may interest you because, who doesn't like a amazingly popular book like this. Buy this book it will be worth it in any way possible.
0385534639|4.0|If the measure of a good read is a book's ability to keep you engaged and take you to another time and place then The Night Circus deserves all the stars in the night's sky.  Entertaining from the start, although sometimes a bit confusing, Erin Morgenstern's first novel transports us back in time to the late 19th century to an enchanting circus that opens at nightfall and closes at dawn.  At the center of both the circus and the novel are Celia and Marco, two gifted young magicians who have been pitted against each other by their father/mentor in a battle that squares off pure magic against illusion, man against woman and thus love against fate.  The characters we meet along way become real and endearing even when placed in a setting of exotic fantasy and the story never falls short of keeping the reader under its spell.
142311339X|4.0|Jason appears out of the blue with no memory, Leo regains his control of fire, and Piper learns about her power to persuade people with her voice. Together, they were meant to prevent the Earth's self-destruction. The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan outlines the three children of the existing Greek gods and their struggle to put together pieces of a prophecy that predicts that they will stop a powerful force, more powerful than the gods themselves, from crushing and crushing everything in its path. Hiding in fear, the gods block off their communication with their children and leave them on their own to figure out what their newly found powers mean, what is the force that is conspiring against all of creation, and how to hold it back... for at least the time being. Following its prologue of the Percy Jackson series, The Lost Hero is also similar to Harry Potter because of the roles of its characters and their battle to rid the world of evil. The book also portrayed romance, which creates a perfect plot when it is sewn into a scene of action. \\"He'd accepted her for herself and didn't judge her because of the stupid things she'd done. They'd spend hours talking, looking at the stars, and eventually - finally - holding hands. All that couldn't be fake,\\" is just one of the examples. Written by the author who seemed as interested by his tale as its readers, The Lost Hero help my attention from cover to cover.

I cannot tell you because I do not have this set.   I am giving this five stars based on the reputation of Bream, and because of the reasonable price. It should not be construed as a review or endorsement, but since amazon did not even bother to list which albums are covered, I felt compelled to post this. I would appreciate someone who has the set offering a real review.

030746363X|5.0|I love the book.  It is fun to read and I love all the self-testing Tim does.  He sounds like a crazy guy.  I have been doing some of the things he recommends but I'm still eating a ton, working out about five days per week and I have lost a few pounds.  I need to be a little more dedicated but his plans are pretty easy to follow.  The only thing I wish is that there is a cheat sheet with all his sup, food and exercise recommendations.  I wish I would have kept a little note book while I read it.  Good read if nothing else you will be aware of what you are doing and some little things that could help you loose a pound here or there.

0385738773|5.0|Out of all the Maze Runner books, I have to say, the Death Cure is the best one. You have not read anything until you have read this. Thomas and his friends think that it's all over, but when they're given a chance to get their memories back, all heck breaks loose. I won't give away anything else, except that the Death Cure is the most wonderful book in the series. I read it in just 2 1/2 hours and could not put it down. There is relief, sadness, hope, lost, love... Don't miss THE DEATH CURE...
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Here is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to count to three and you are going to love this movie if your a comic fan.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|How do I begin with something this amazing? First off, I have read all the \\"mixed\\" reviews and the main thing the naysayers are missing is this: SCOTTY HAS THE IT FACTOR!  People Magazine said it well when they said that!  One reviewer says about \\"Write Your Number on my Hand\\" can't he use a cellphone.  Really, how cynical.  In a society where people barely speak to each other anymore and you look at a restaurant and both parties are staring down at their phones; on the \\"mini\\" internet and no longer care to communicate it's refreshing to have such a romantic notion to simply write a number on your hand.  And Scotty sings it to perfection.  Besides which as great as it is, every song besides it is even better!  Dirty Dishes is most every housewife/mother's story; and it's so inspirational..I cannot tell you in words how many times my dishes are piled up again after I cleaned the house spotless because of my \\"busy bees\\"!  I absolutely love Back On The Ground; what a beautiful pure sentiment and got to love when his mother asks if he wants another cup of coffee and he goes YEAH I'LL TAKE ONE MORE. Scotty has a way about him where he knows just how to throw a sentence in to perfection..he has so much personality in his deep soothing voice and he is an amazing performer as well!  Honestly, I truly believe there are a lot of people who are just plain jealous of Scotty McCreery. I love That Old King James and the way in which Scotty kept to his roots and his religion.  So often, after Idol a winner will stray from who they were on the show; that same person millions of fans fell in love with. Not so with Scotty; the CD is a fantastic extension of the show but he keeps his moral grounds. IT'S CLEAR AS DAY THAT THE TITLE TRACK CLEAR AS DAY WILL BE A HUGE MEGA HIT!  Can you imagine the idea that you find this girl and everything is going smooth and you go to a big party and everything seems good and she kisses you like nobody else ever did and she casually tells you she'll call tomorrow and in the blink of an eye, she's gone.  Whatever the tragedy is be it a car accident as in this song or anything else, many many people will relate to this song on a personal level and for those fortunate enough to not have that terribly tragedy in their own life, it is a stunner, the ominous sound in Scotty's voice from the start..that feeling like you know something's wrong but you don't know what.  As for the rocking songs, THEY ARE ALL EXCELLENT!!  Scotty did Keith Urban justice with Walk In The Country..so incredible!  Water Tower Town is basically the story of Scotty's life right there!  You Make That Look Good is totally hot!  Better Than That is the catchiest song on Earth!  Of course The Trouble With Girls is a showcase for his remarkable soothing voice and we all know what happened with I Love You This Big as it sold six hundred thousand copies in four months time and went gold!  Rolling Stone wrote a rather rude review (although didn't even bother to review most Idol cd's) but did make mention of Walk In The Country and Clear As Day as standout songs and even compared Clear As Day to Underwood's Jesus Take The Wheel.  What I have to say to Rolling Stone.  GET READY BECAUSE IN YOUR MAGAZINE ON THE BILLBOARD HOT TWO HUNDRED SCOTTY MCCREERY MADE HISTORY HAS LANDING THE ONE SPOT!  This CD Clear As Day will ultimately sell millions of copies and Scotty will ultimately be the next COUNTRY SUPERSTAR!  He is practically there already and only seventeen when he recorded this cd.  Incredible artists always have haters who will be eaten up like spaghetti in a hot Italian restaurant.  Scotty you have an amazing deep voice with great range proven on this CD and incredible stage presence.  Stay grounded, I know you will.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|First of all, to anyone that thinks this movie is supposed to be deep, realistic and taken seriously; don't. I don't believe it was meant to be taken seriously, however it's still not funny. Yea, it has a few giggle moments here & there but most of the scenes made no sense. Weak Plot. Too many scenes that tried too hard. It wasn't necessarily boring but simply not funny.<br /><br />The dry humping scene was extra, totally unnecessary. The teachers other than Cameron Diaz were torture to watch. Seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer.<br /><br />I recommend ages 18 & older only to watch, anyone younger is just inappropriate. It suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana.

1594202710|5.0|I know little about China and found this book to be very informative and up-to-date about how China functions as a political entity.  First, the summary.  In the first third of the book, Kissinger outlines the important history that established China's psychological and ideological foundation, starting with the idea that China believed it harkened back to a time when there was great harmony (this historic time is far back in the past and without date).  This great harmony was the goal of China and her emperors: to always restore to China this great past. Kissinger points out that most civilizations have a creation myth and that China did not, instead they assumed they had always been. Across Chinese history then, emperors came and went according to their ability to maintain balance: when chaos would rise and disorganization occur it was time for a new emperor.  The perspective of inevitable rule pervades Chinese history and their dealing with outsiders. Unlike religious nations, China had no desire to convert others to their religion but slowly indoctrinated them into their cultural norms with little absorption on China's part of other cultures' norms.  Their relationship with other  countries was largely from the position of assuming their superiority and up until the 19th century effectively holding off conquerors through a policy of diplomacy, patience and inciting rivalry among the others.      However, with increased incursions from Britain and Russia, the success of this approach began to change and China had to begin to give way, allowing the foreigners to gain a larger foothold in the country while still attempting to maintain their cultural norms and sense of superiority.  What dramatically changed the worshiping of the Great Harmony appears to be the rise of Mao who initiated the Great Leap forward which combined some of the classic practices of Chinese history with a complete and constant restructuring of the culture and people through revolution.  At theheart of Mao's ideology was a faith that the Chinese people would prevail, and one wonders whether any other nation would have been able to kill so many so quickly with so little resistance.  The next third of the book is spent on Chinese and American miscommunication and the influence of Russia across the 50's and 60's and finally leading to a rapprochement between Mao and Nixon and thus China and the US. Kissinger seems to be making the point that the Chinese and Americans were incapable of understanding one another: one country's deterrence was another country's unprovoked attack over and over again, starting with Korea, enduring through Vietnam and, Kissinger suggests, continuing to a lesser degree today. While the lack of understanding has persisted, Mao and Nixon, Kissinger asserts, made some real progress in the 1970's towards opening doors between these nations, largely in response to Mao's fear of the Soviet Union and the lack of success of his cultural revolution.   The third part of the book focuses on the rise of Deng, Mao's successor, and the resulting openness and reform that he brought. In this era, normalization was established between the countries that balanced the contending ideologies while making no move to shift either. Deng saw in America the possibility for technological advances for his country, and he pursued this course through accepting the US as an ally but without developing an alliance with it. From this position, the two countries would also work to limit Soviet aggression. Deng's programs of openness and development continued through the Reagan administration. However, small scale revolts throughout the communist world occurred and China was no exception. Deng was forced to confront his country's own internal protests that culminated in the crack down at Tiananmen square thus forcing China to reassert itself as an authoritarian state at heart, regardless of reforms. The crack downs at Tienanmen created significant tension with the US for the next decade.   Deng's far reaching reforms would continue even after his death and in fact flourish under Jiang, an unlikely Chinese leader but one that would pull China into the twenty first century.  This last part of the book is rife with enthusiasm for China's seemingly miraculous growth and potential through the 1990's and into 2000. In 2000, China had a new leader, Jintao, and the relationship between the two countries had become more equalized as China's gross national product and exports exploded. Now the two countries would have to figure out how to navigate the 21st century world without a Soviet Union as ballast. In many ways, the new China was a reversion to a time before Chiang Kai shek and Mao, one focused on harmony and prosperity.  Kissinger ends with a look to two (or three) possible futures between the big giants. The first is that the two will have to clash because of inevitable rising tensions (the neoconservatives support this view); the second is that China will become large enough to attempt to take over as the world power; and the third (Kissinger's) is that they will continue to work together towards world peace and global stability. This last, argues Kissinger, is China's stated position as well. Kissinger labels this \\"co-evolution\\" where both nations pursue their agendas while minimizing conflict. The development of a \\"Pacific Community\\" would, argues Kissinger, make China and the US part of a common, mutually beneficial enterprise.  On Form  Kissinger is an excellent, detailed writer with extensive quoted source material, in depth examination of motives on all sides and corresponding reflection on events that looked one way during the event and look differently today. He seems especially adept at understanding the psychology and motives of the Chinese in the political arena.  His tone is one of surety with little room for doubt in his own conclusions and deductions. But, when he clearly does not know motives or intents, he raises questions about these without drawing conclusions. Because I know little about this history, I have no idea how accurate his claims and deductions are; however, whenever possible he backs up statements with quoted proof.  Few contemporary authors are in the position of Kissinger to provide such detailed first hand evidence of the past 50 years of the relationship between China and the US and this knowledge reverberates throughout the book (this is not the cliff notes guide to modern relations with China, although the first third provides a very brief but highly useful foray into Chinese history).  There are less notes than I expected, and, disappointingly, no bibliography.  It seems like in this book that Kissinger's underlying philosophy is that America's values and freedoms are spectacular but also lead us into difficulty when we believe in exporting or imposing them, particularly in their distinctly American form.  He suggests that our relationship with China was hindered by our inability to focus on a foreign policy agenda fueled by foreign policy objectives and not a value laden agenda or objectives. Clearly, for Kissinger, the relationships among these important countries is the objective, not the values underlying.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|A lot had been said by Michael Bay before this movie came out that he recognized the multitudes of problems with Transformers 2 and they were all going to be fixed for Transformers 3.   He lied. The only problem Michael Bay saw with Transformers 2 was that Transformers 2, at two and a half hours long, wasn't long enough.   Before I begin totally railing against this abomination, I'll say some nice things. Transformers 2 had no overarching story. This one kind of does, in that stuff that happens at the beginning factors into stuff that occasionally happens for the rest of the movie. Also, you can kind of make out what's going on in these action scenes, for perhaps the first time in this series. I dunno if that's due to Bay shooting for 3D or what, but you can actually see these action scenes.   Unfortunately, none of that matters. While we finally may be able to tell WHAT is going on on screen, there's still no way to decipher WHY any of it is going on on screen. Characters remain the bane of Bay's career, in that none of them are interesting in any way and none of them have arcs. What the hell have Tyrese or Josh Duhamel done in ANY of these movies? John Turturro? Shia's Parents? Half of the transformers whose names I can't remember because there's nothing memorable about them? I could go on. There are so many characters that serve no purpose and are only in there because Michael Bay thinks they're amusing. They're not amusing and the movie would be much better off without the lot of them. I must also pause and make special mention of Ken Jeong in this movie. His character and performance are surreal. I dunno if Bay let him run wild with the role or directed him that way, but he is the worst thing about this whole movie.   And then there's Shia. Maybe he kind of has an arc in this movie. He occasionally whines about growing up and being a man, but that's all he does. There's no resolution or moment of growth, he just talks about it every now and again. And Shia's acting is downright grating. He seemingly alternates between extreme emotions at random. Remember when Spielberg thought this guy was a big deal? Those times have passed. Even worse is Shia's new girlfriend. If you can find me a more bland leading woman in a film, I'd be shocked. I was no fan of Megan Fox, but she is leagues better than Rosie Big Lips. At least she had a personality.   It'd all be fine if the action was cool, but it's not. Everyone raves about the hour long action scene in Chicago. It's a terrible hour that never ends. There are action scenes that work within this scene (most notably the building falling set piece) but the rest take place for no reason. There's no objective for most of the action scenes and therefore nothing is ever accomplished. The wing suit scene? What the hell did those jerks do once they landed? Nothing! They land and are never heard from again. These action scenes carry all the weight of a screensaver.   I also must bring something else up. In said long action scene in Chicago, there is a good seventeen minutes of screen time where Optimus Prime is caught in wires. Optimus Prime, in case you don't know, is a giant robot who can fly and has a giant gun and carries a sword. And he's caught in wires. For seventeen minutes. Other Transformers even try to come and help him, and he's still caught IN F#@$ING WIRES for seventeen minutes. This is some of the laziest writing I've ever seen. It's also a very good indication that a) Optimus Prime is a terrible character and b) that action scene goes on for far too long.   I don't know why I watched either Transformers sequel. Morbid curiosity, I suppose. I just don't understand why this franchise makes a billion dollars every time out when we have plenty of blockbusters that bring the spectacle without forgoing basic filmmaking/storytelling competency. This summer alone we got Harry Potter, Captain America, X-Men First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. All of those movies are wildly better than this trash heap. Hell, even Fast Five puts this movie to shame.   To put it shortly, the Transformers trilogy is the worst trilogy ever made.

B002ZG99G8|4.0|well, let's start off w/the cast is superb, story was very interseting, & the action was over the top. i thought it was going to be a great flick @ the theaters. i was right, but i got more than expected. 1 thing is zoe is a true babe! some of the cast was what got me. i've always liked jeffory dean morgen. every since i've been watching supernatural. chris evans was a good choice for that role. he's really got a talent for his craft, esp. being in his 3rd comic book movie. esp cap am. he's great in it, but the fantastic four, even when it was panned. he still had his charm. for the others, i've not really seen them in any thing else. dvd was ok, not the sp feauters i was hoping for. bloopers, interviews i got but not much. nevertheless, i was pleased w/all the action, story, i think who's not sure if they want to watch, give it a chance.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great product, amazing production value. All Star Wars fans' wet dream. The quality is incredible and the extras are just mind bloggling. My favorite is watching all the movies with the producers' and directors' commentaries. That is simply a priceless experience and warrants the purchase by itself. If you are a Star Wars fan this is the PERFECT bundle for you! Even if you are not a huge fan, this is the package that will make you one, so go and grab it now!

0316066524|4.0|First off, I do love post-modern lit. I also like it when I'm reading books that feel like they're happening in my head, that I'm thinking them instead of reading them. Maybe I'm just wired that way.  I'm not going to get into all the issues that so many others have already gone over in some detail (some amazing reviews in here). I'm just going over what led me to a 4-star review.  First, I look at \\"entertainments\\" as a sort of roller coaster ride or an opportunity to go to the edge and look over and then safely retreat to my day-to-day life. This is definitely one of those books only it can be really tough to pull back from the edge. The characters in this book are so broken, so filled with despair, there were many times when I found myself thinking, \\"I'm surprised DFW didn't kill himself while he was writing this.\\"  He paints black, black, black, scary pictures. And then, just when you're about to drown in the despair he's weaving around you, he drops a line that'll have you laughing out loud for minutes on end. The guy knew how to manipulate catharsis.  Something smells delicious.  I found his timing excellent. I felt played like a violin.  I really enjoyed his prose, and didn't let myself get too hung up when I came across words whose meanings I didn't know (I found most relatively to figure out based on the context).  One of the things I particularly enjoyed about his prose was how every character had a unique voice. Marathe's Quebecois French seems translated literally. Don Gately's voice is much more vivid because not only does his character mangle the language when he speaks, but his language is just as mangled when you're reading his thoughts. Or Hal's non-stop, manic patter as he tries to figure out how just to set up that one last marijuana binge. He's cracking up, and through DFW's use of language and pacing, you start to feel the same way. I came out of that passage wracked, sweating, and paranoid. Just like Hal.  One of the things that really surprisedme was his treatment of AA and NA. At first, I was prepared for him to look down on the meetings and methods they used, but as you start to attend these meetings and see the wrecked lives these people lead, their efforts to pull themselves out of the shitter feel almost heroic, and you see a grudging admiration for the works of the people who run the meetings. I was genuinely stunned and moved by that. Beautifully done.  And that's what I really liked about the book: if you let yourself go, DFW's technique puts you in each character's position. I had no problem succumbing to it, though there were definitely times that, as a result, I just had to put the book down for a few days as it seriously zapped my head.  But, as much as I liked it, as much as I was able to put on the book and wear it, there were definitely times when I just plowed ahead to get through something. It was as if at times like these, DFW's humor left him. As did his pacing, and that would often get me thinking, \\"OK, OK, OK, I get it. Life sucks. Now, can we just get on with it?\\"  In the end, though, I think it's a wonderful book. As others have said, don't expect anything close to a traditional structure. Just be patient, and when a new piece of the puzzle falls into place, snap it on in and feel the novel's ultimate shape shift a bit.  You won't be the same reader coming out as you were going in.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|When I first saw this movie in Germany some 20 years ago, I was amazed by it's intensity: of the feeling expressed in it but also the colors, the music and the acting to match it. Although the US version is slightly different than the German version, this movie still charmed me. Two women thrown together in a small rest stop in the big US desert, who are hurting, mistrusting each other and - eventually - develop a real friendship. CCH Pounder and Marianne Saegebrecht are stunning in their performance. And whoever loves to see Jack Pallance acting - this is one of his best characters. As a retired Hollywood stage painter he sets the pace for the subtler, more artistic and touching sequences of the movie. Although the movie starts with fights, abandonning and hurt feelings, it is a \\"Gute-Laune-Film\\" (German: High spirits movie), as my friend put it. If you want to know what friendship is and how it develops: watch this movie!

I fully appriciate their dedication.  and they said returning the dvd was not necessary.  I'm still waiting for the replacement, but I firmly believe that  should their be any defects or problems, Top Hits will be there to take care of it.

But I think she is, sadly, back to forcing an exaggerated affectation into her voice, just as she did in Essence and some of her other less satisfying discs.  Little Honey was close to perfection...she seemed so likeable and fun in the midst of her angst.  Here she is back to sounding a bit pathetic and trying way too hard to find a certain sound.
0553381695|2.0|I am completely confused. I am reading Clash of Kings after finishing Game of Thrones.  But most of the characters they are talking about have already died in book 1 or at least their experiences already happened in the first book. Clash of Kings does not continue the story from Game of Thrones but instead repeats things that I have already read.  Am I psychic?  Am I imagining this?  I cannot find anyone else's comments that reflect this.  Is this a glitch in the Kindle edition?

Thanks Amazon for making it available.  I really enjoyed this.
1595826971|5.0|Simply one of the best artbooks ever made. Just like what almost everybody else has mentioned, it's crammed with amazing artworks and definitely worth the money. Many artbooks that I've seen in the past are either crammed with words, or contained  only a few pages but sold at a ridiculously expensive price. This one exceeds most of them, and every page is a delight. In addition, despite all the information and pictures in it, the book is almost spoiler-free (but you get a good glimpse of what will be in the game.)  However, seeing it makes me disappointed in EA and Spicy Horse (yes, both are responsible for the actual game turning out not as brilliant as the concept.) I've obtained the artbook first before playing the game. After being thoroughly impressed with the art and starting to play, what I've expected didn't show up, or it either did but appear in an awkward manner that was off and didn't fit in the plot.   I'd still say PLAY THE GAME if you have the chance to. It's not the best EA & Spicy Horse can give us, but it's not too horrible either.  Anyway, it's a 5-star from me, and as the game didn't seem \\"complete\\" enough, the artbook did fill the rest of the stuff in. Great collection!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The greatly anticipated second series of Downton Abbey picks up two years on from the first series in 1916, in the middle of World War 1. Downton Abbey has been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen and the action covers the period from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. As in the first series, topical events of the period, political, economic and military are covered.<br /><br />The wartime scenario and the convalescent home setting provide an excellent background for some interesting story lines. The combination of excellent plot lines, great acting and the superb setting display all that is best in TV period drama. This time round we have eight more episodes to add to the seven in the first series. As befits wartime, the costumes are not as flamboyant as in the first series but they are thoroughly researched and appropriate to the period.<br /><br />There continue to be many superb individual performances but mention must be made of Maggie Smith. What a stroke of genius to cast her as Violet. She dominates every scene she appears in and often has some very funny lines.<br /><br />This DVD includes the Downton Abbey 2 hour Christmas Special which is probably the single best episode of Downton Abbey to date.  High drama here with a cliffhanging murder trial as well as the usual romance, drama, betrayal etc one would expect!<br /><br />The UK has a long tradition of producing fine period dramas and this is the most successful since the early 1980s when [[ASIN:B005GP7ELW Brideshead Revisited: 30th Anniversary Edition]] took the world by storm.  Peak viewing figures in the UK are 11m which is an astounding number for that market. It is pleasing to learn that a third series is already planned and we now know that this will cover an 18 month period from 1920 to 1921. This one is likely to run and run and I would not be surprised to see Downton Abbey continuing up to the 1930s eventually.
B005I64U5C|3.0|Comedian Ryan Reynolds saves earth from a bitter handicapped gentleman and the king of the Rastafarians. Yeah... that pretty much sums it up.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|I suppose I'm not what one would call a \\"major\\" Pink Floyd fan, although I have formed a great respect for their music.  Three albums of theirs in particular - \\"Dark Side of The Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"The Wall\\" - I count as some of the best and most adventurous music ever created.  While the latter two albums show imperfections with subsequent listens, DSotM retains a perfection that is both magical and exciting.  It remains a wonderful musical journey to lose oneself in from time to time.    So when I saw Pink Floyd decided to release surround sound mixes of DSotM on DVD format and not the (what I at least think is) unecessary and largely unuseful SACD format, I was thrilled.  I wasn't even purturbed initially by the $100+ price tag.  Hey, nice things cost money!  Well, I did get what I wanted in finally hearing a great 5.1 surround mix of DSotM.  This album truly lends itself to the surround sound format.  There is also a nice live recording of the complete album along with demos and other earlier recordings, all of which work as a fine companion to the album.  Unfortunately though, there isn't much more about this box set to really recommend.  Whoever is running the Pink Floyd operation these days took an opportunity to be a little exploitive with this product, and that clearly shows when evaluating what else was included.    Perhaps the biggest quibble I had to this box set was the choice to include a Blu-Ray disc.  This really wasn't necessary.  The 96 Hz/24 bit mix included on Blu-Ray could have been included on a standard DVD (as have been done by others...more on that later).  Surely one of the 4 or 5 other mixes could have been axed in place of it.  And what is up with all these mixes anyway?!  448 kbps, 640 kbps...do these differences really stand out that much?  I'm just happy I get to hear this album in surround sound.  I could've lived with just hearing it in 448 kbps, which alone is a vast improvement over the stereo mix.  Having more options isn't always a good thing.  As for the video included on the Blu-Ray, most of it is 30+ years old and shows imperfection quite clearly.  It didn't improve with being on the Blu-Ray format when compared to the standard disc, and having to include a Blu-Ray disc for it probably upped the price for the whole set a good $20 or $30.  Nothing really was better on Blu-Ray, so I'm left wondering why they chose to use it if not for a few extra bucks from their fans.    Then there's the packaging, which has already been complained about in other reviews here.  I really didn't need marbles, or a scarf, or a bunch of envelopes with pictures and press pass facsimilies.  I also didn't need an oversized booklet, much less two of them.  The books would have been a much better idea had they actually served an informative purpose, like including some essays or insights from the band or production team (although they do include a brief, very brief write-up about choosing the album cover).  Surely the Floyd folks aren't that busy that they can't sit down to write about what it was like to make this great rock album.  I should think that would be something they'd be proud to talk about.    Basically this box set just isn't worthy of the album at its core.  Personally, I think it shows a great disrespect to fans as well.  And if I feel let down, I can certainly understand major fans not being happy with this product and lost potential it seems to represent.  Then again, perhaps I've been spoiled and was expecting too much.    While I'm not a major Pink Floyd fan, I am a major Genesis fan.  A few years ago, Genesis released a series of five box sets that included all of their albums in CD/DVD combos with the DVDs including surround mixes in both 448 kbps and 96 Hz/24 bit.  The box sets also included video material, full concerts, extra tracks and B-sides (also in surround sound), and new interviews.  Each album was also later released individually in  CD/DVD combos for fans who just wanted to dip into the band's catalog, not needing all the additional material found on the box sets.  This simple approach resulted in products Genesis fans of all eras could enjoy and (probably most iomportantly) could relatively afford.  And when it came to Blu-Ray, the band's production team simply noted nothing improved with Blu-Ray when they tried it, and it would be more expensive to use it, so why make fans pay more for only marginal improvements.  That's a band respecting their fans!   This is the attitude Pink Floyd and its management should have taken with this box set.  I had hoped to eventually buy the \\"Wish You Were Here\\" set, but now I'm not so sure.  DSotM has a remarkable legacy as a high point in the classic rock landscape, which is entirely deserved.  But such a legacy isn't set in stone though, and it can be ruined easily by greedy record companies, too many rereleases, and too many lost possibilities.  A few more disappointing moves like this box set, and this will ultimately become the legacy of a great work of rock music.
B000MV90B2|2.0|The movie is great!!!  A movie not to be missed by history buffs.  The delivery was on time as usual for Amazon shipments.   Unfortunately the quality of this dvd is VERY poor.  The picture is blurry, sound is terrible.  It looks like a movie that was filmed by someone at a theater and then burned to a DVD.  Only reason for two stars is the movie and the actors.......guess I should have read posted reviews to see if anyone else had problems with the quality of the DVD.
0385534639|3.0|This book was disappointing given all the hype it's received...the physical descriptions of the circus are gorgeous, but Morgenstern falters when she's describing people and events rather than things. The main characters are remarkably bland for dueling magicians, and the plot moves along at a glacial pace. She's so dedicated to keeping the details of the logistics of the duel mysterious that I ended up not caring that much about it either way!  This might be a book where you need to just let the imagery wash over you and not worry too much about the plot.  Unfortunately for me, I'm not good at doing that, and I would guess that other readers like me will also be left a bit cold by it.
B001LXIDVS|4.0|Well, here we come to the 3rd and (sniff) final chapter. I bought the trilogy for my mother, and while she did enjoy parts 1 and 2, she felt this 3rd one was the best. And we could easily argue that the 3rd is the best. Going through my mother's TAXI DVDs, it seems that Christopher Lloyd brings the most qualities of his famous character Jim Ignatowski into play here. (Example: reading a letter he wrote and crying: 'I never knew I could write anything so touching.')<br /><br />Marty finds that Doc Brown will be murdered back in 1885 (where he ended up at the end of Part 2 when the lightning struck the time machine). So the 1955 Doc Brown helps Marty get the time machine working again.<br /><br />There is somewhat of a sad winding down as we see that when we first saw the time machine in Part 1, it could only be driven. Then by the end of part 1 the time machine could fly; now in Part 3, it can no longer fly and can only be driven; and soon after Marty arrives in 1885, he has an accident, and it can no longer move and must be pushed or pulled somehow. (SIGH) With some sad symbolism, we know that this is going to be the last chapter.<br /><br />Moving on, Marty runs across his great great grandfather (played also by Michael J. Fox). This is interesting in that he finally has a blood relative 'father figure' on his adventures. And he spends a fair amount of time explaining to Marty that if he keeps jumping everytime someone calls him 'chicken' he's going to eventually plague himself with disastrous and possibly irreversible consequences. (We already heard his parents speak about this in Part 2. So we know something is going to possibly happen because of this.)<br /><br />Without going on too long, Doc Brown realizes that he has fallen in love with a school teacher named Clara. So, this of course complicates things. Escaping into the future could mean breaking his own heart as well as hers.<br /><br />In all honesty, this 3rd chapter has the most suspense as well as the most value in the ways of characters growing. Marty (with the help of his great great grandfather and Doc Brown too) realizes that it's stupid to jump everytime someone calls you a name. And after all the time he thought about the future, Doc finds that he is most happy in the past.<br /><br />Lloyd brought REAL comedy to the role when he portrays himself as a depressed drinker talking about the future in the old west. (Another Jim Ignatowski moment.)<br /><br />It's probably also right to take amoment to talk about the antagonist Thomas Wilson. He could be a convincing bully, a tough mafia type, an evil cowboy, and even a nice redeemable guy as we have seen in the end of Part 1, and again in Part 3.<br /><br />Robert Englund was not so likable as the principal in Parts 1 and 2. BUT, he is really likable and admirable as the ancestor of his Prinicpal Strickland  character Marshal Strickland. This is Englund's best moment in the trilogy. He knows he can't just kill Maddog Tannenn, but he isn't blinded by the 'law abiding citizen act' either. \\"Maddog, the only party I'll be celebrating is the one that ends with you hanging at the end of a rope.\\"<br /><br />Overall, it's a great trilogy. And we could easily argue that Part 3 is the best.Marty (with the help of his great great grandfather and Doc Brown too) realizes that it's stupid to jump everytime someone calls you a name.

B005ER6SNM|5.0|\\"A Serbian film\\" is what you would proudly term a 'psychological drama'. I feel the first and primary aim of the film is to throw light on the fact that greed can destroy one's world, very well shown from the perspective of 'Milos' played brilliantly by Srdjan Todorovic. Sergej Trifunovic is brilliant as well. Apart from the gore, blood and the terrifying events that take place, the film is a brilliant 'Character study' film and deals with a subject very rare in films. Its a very well done film, you may be disturbed but you will not dislike it.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series.  The acting is quite good, and the cast consists of many veteran UK actors who are recognizable from other dramas. The series is well written.  It weaves together multiple investigations within each story line.  For example, the first drama consists of three investigations, as well as developments in the private life of the main protagonist, Jason Isaacs. I watched the UK episodes without captions and the PBS episodes with captions, and the use of captions greatly helped me understand the dialogue. I strongly urge using the subtitles.  The structure used by the BBC in broadcasting this series was to air twin one-hour episodes on consecutive nights; resulting in a single drama consisting of approximately one-hour and 55 minutes.  The only problem that I have with this structure is that you have a climax in the middle of the drama, which seems unnecessary when the two episodes are viewed back to back (as opposed to on consecutive nights.)   Beginning next week, PBS will start to show these dramas in two-hour blocks (the twin UK episodes joined together).  When watching the series, keep in mind that PBS has redacted approximately 5 minutes or so in order to fit the episode into the allocated time slot. The DVD, which is not produced by PBS, contains the full UK episodes.  The 5 minutes or so cut are substantive (e.g., (i)in the first drama - scene where father abuses daughter is drastically cut, and (ii) in the third drama, the kidnapped victim's escape is drastically cut), and don't include the additional non-substantive cuts (e.g., one set of credits and titles, as well as the scene at the start of the second hour of the drama that remind the audience of what transpired on the previous night).  My only complaint regarding the DVD is the price.  $36 is a bit steep for less than six hours of TV.  I will wait until the price comes down.  For example, I purchased Downton Abbey for under $20 when it first came out, and it is cheaper now.  I expect a series like this to sell for $25 or so.  Considering the limited content (under six hours), I don't think that a higher price is justified. (NOTE TO AMAZON: $40-$50 FOR A SEASON OF NEW TRICKS IS OUTRAGEOUS.)
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I have to admit that this movie could have been an utter disaster. And this movie did a few things pretty well, while other things could have used some polish, some rewrites and maybe some different direction altogether in some areas. Helmsworth was great as Thor I'd have to admit. The story overall was rushed and I get that there is enough of Thor's back story to easily make two movies (and it is a popcorn movie) but as a comic fan you can only hope for the treatment that it deserves. The love story wasn't developed enough for anyone to care-but that aside--Portman has never looked better. Asgard was interesting but never felt 'real'. The place seemed empty and devoid of a population despite a rather large crowd shot. And the small town where Thor lands in feels a bit to much like a movie set. I also  could have done without the giant metal guy-it reminded me too much of those 50's alien invasion movies-little cheesy.   I'd have to say I'm not sure what I was expecting....Maybe a bit more Braveheart...A bit more Kevin Noland. But all-in-all its not a bad attempt, and while fun and entertaining-- I can't shake the feeling that this film will not age well.
0452295548|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. What an amazing journey this brilliant woman, and Harvard neuroscientist, went on when she lost her left hemisphere through a massive stroke. Although it took her eight years to make a full recovery, her insights into the workings of the brain, and especially the right hemisphere, were an eye-opener. As a neuroanatomist falling into a stroke, she described, moment by moment, which brain functions she was losing and what it felt like while the stroke was actually occurring. Then she describes the slow process of her recovery, with the wonderful help of her loving mother. The book was written to give stroke victims the hope of recovery, to help carers understand what the stroke victim needs during recovery, to give readers an insight into the workings of their own minds, and to provide information to neuroscientists who may never have a stroke themselves, but who need to be able to understand the condition from the inside out. The author, Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, is a very brave and amazing woman, and this book certainly proves it.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Great entertainment!especially enjoyed the making of the production. She is a real star. Would love to see Celine live in Vegas or anywhere.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|Heritage was well worth the wait. Yes I kinda miss the death growls. From the title track to the finale of \\"Marrow of the Earth\\" I was blown away! I got the special edition on 9/16 and listened to it the whole weekend as much as I could! Opeth really show off their influences big time on Heritage. I heard King Crimson, Atomic Rooster, Black Widow, Camel, Pink Floyd etc. I think this will be Opeth's new start of the direction they will go musically. Hell, I'm all for it and help all true fans are. I've been a fan since Blackwater Park and own all their albums. All great bands through the 60's to today have changed styles and always met resistance from \\"fans\\" claiming they sold out. Okay, compare Led Zeppelin 1 with In Through the Out Door, Black Sabbath with Never Say Die and so on. If Heritage sounded like Orchid I wouldn't be impressed. I'd be upset because it would be boring as hell. Long Live Opeth!!!
B004SRNH10|5.0|Works great on my Nexus S! Highly recommended. You can now move it to the SD card which is awesome.
B003B2C92G|2.0|For some unknown reason, although this version is not rated, it is definitely not the R version I have come to know and love. This distributor comes out of Canada and there were missing scenes & dialogue, which were, in my opinion, not a good thing.  I may be that this is the only Blu-ray version that exists for the film. Perhaps Mcfarlane couldn't strike a deal with New Line--who know's. Until then, my recommendation is to wait for the R version.
1455510319|5.0|I like Michael Connelly a lot. When I first read one of his books, I think he had 2 or 3 on the shelf, and I thought they were good procedurals, but not great. Then he wrote \\"The Poet\\" and it was clear he'd finally gotten onto something truly worthwhile. A few books later, \\"The Concrete Blonde\\" solidified my belief that his ability to plot a book was at times quite impressive. Both \\"Blood Work\\" and \\"Angel's Flight\\" reinforced that, and since he's done several books that have been quite good. \\"The Reversal\\", while not his best, was pretty good, and fun. \\"The Fifth Witness\\" is an interesting book for him also, and I have to say the ending surprised me. Surprise endings that actually make sense, and are believable, are relatively rare these days (at least for me, given that I've read so many detective novels and am such a cynic) so when one comes along, I'm typically very impressed. This is one of those books.  Mickey Haller, the character from \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" and a string of other books, has descended to the point where he's defending people whose houses are going to be foreclosed on. One of the clients is a schoolteacher who has been leading an internet protest against the bank who's foreclosing on her, and when she's accused of killing the bank officer in charge of foreclosures, naturally Mickey steps in as her defense attorney. The meat of the book is the trial, where various maneuvers by both sides swing the case back and forth, with things one minute leaning towards her innocence, and the next towards her guilt. The result is fascinating, and the ending was really a surprise for me. I sensed part of it, but the rest wasn't on my radar screen, and so I was somewhat floored.  I really enjoyed this novel, and would recommend it. It's one of Connelly's better books.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I did not read the reviews before purchase and wish I had. Horrible product! Every episode has a skip or stall issue and the second half of each disc had not been recorded. Plus one of the reasons I wanted to get the DVDs was to get the super-sized versions on the original run. These are the versions edited for syndication. Amazon.com should pull this product from their inventory. I would've given it 0 stars but could not submit.  The only positive to this was how easy the return process was.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|\\"Star Trek: Enterprise\\" is actually a much better show than you've been led to believe. There are a lot of things \\"Enterprise\\" does right, unfortunately there are quite a few mis-steps as well.<br /><br />Let's get this out of the way first:<br />The Bad:<br />The Writing - The stories, specifically the 1st and 2nd SeasonS, the writing is very uneven and at times dull. The episodes dealing with time travel in particular are pretty tepid at best. Unfortunately, the time travel \\"Temporal Cold War\\" episodes dominate the first two seasons, and while some are better than others, for the most part I preferred the stand alone episodes much more.<br /><br />Scott Bakula - I like Scott Bakula...as Sam Beckett in \\"Quantum Leap\\" or as Terry in the recently cancelled \\"Men of a Certain Age\\". Bakula did a great job in both of those roles by simply being Scott Bakula. Watching \\"Enterprise\\" you see Scott Bakula in a Star Fleet uniform, but he never really becomes the character. He acts exactly the same as he did in \\"Quantum Leap\\" and you don't buy him as a Star Fleet Captain. For one, he's too nice. Captain Archer does some pretty nasty things throughout this series, but you never buy Bakula's Captain doing them. I could see Shatner's Kirk forcing a clone to an early death so it's stem cells can be harvested, or Picard taking an alien ship's warp core to save his own ship, but by doing so he's basically stranding the aliens 3 years from  home...but not Archer. And that is because we never really meet Archer, we see Scott Bakula instead. If an unknown had been cast in the roll, then I think Archer would've developed into one of the most memorable characters the whole Trek Universe.<br /><br />\\"Faith of the Heart\\" - I'm sorry, of all this mis-steps this show takes, the opening theme may be the worst. The soft-rock theme is horrible, like the b-side of a Michael Bolton song released in 1993. It dates the show, and you really miss the sweeping, epic instrumentals that open the Trek shows.<br /><br />There are some other mis-steps, but those 3 are the main faults I found with the show overall.<br /><br />Now with that said, there are plenty of reasons the make \\"Enterprise\\" well worth adding to your collection.<br />The Good Stuff:<br />The Xindi Storyline - \\"Enterprise\\" really hits its stride at the very end of Season 2 (and throughout the rest of it's run) when an alien probe attacks Earth. Season 3 features some of the best episodes not only of \\"Enterprise\\" but in all of \\"Star Trek\\". There are some genuine nail-biter episodes, some truly funny shows, some great episodes that will tug at your heart, and even a terrificly scary episode featuring \\"zombie\\" Vulcans. Excellent story-telling, great visual effects, a season long story that never lets up. Season 3 takes everything we've learned in Seasons 1 & 2, build on it, develops the characters so that we really care about them, and the show begins firing on all cylinders.<br /><br />The Rest of the Crew - Okay, so I wasn't sold on Scott Bakula as Captain Archer, well the rest of the cast more than makes up for it. While character development is pretty slow for the first season or two (with the exception of Doctor Phlox and the focus on Captain Archer), the secondary character really shine in season two, three and four. Connor Trinneer as \\"Trip\\" Tucker and Jolene Blalock as the Vulcan T'Pol, really come into their own with the second season forward, really creating great characters. The characters of Malcolm Reed, Hoshi Sato and Travis Mayweather, while not as developed as the four \\"main\\" characters, each get a chance to shine as well. By the end of the fourth and final season, you really come to care for this crew.<br /><br />The Gimmick Episodes - One of my favorite things about \\"Enterprise\\" was that the writers had to come up with creative ways to toss in a gimmick episode. Instead of just sending the crew to the \\"holodeck\\" (which was way over-used in other Trek series), the \\"Enterprise\\" crew gotput into some crazy situations. Vulcans in 1950's Pennsylvania, the aforementioned \\"Zombie Vulcan\\" episode, imaginitive episodes involving the Borg and several involving Augments as well, a couple of great \\"Mirror Universe\\" episodes and the fantastic finale.<br /><br />Guest Stars - I love the occasional characters that populate Trek shows, like John de Lancie as \\"Q\\" in TNG. \\"Enterprise\\" has some of the most memorable, the Andorian Commander Schran played by Jeffrey Combs is fantastic! Watching as his character evolves over all four seasons was a real treat, and he seems to be involved in most of my favorite episodes. Gary Graham as Vulcan Ambassador Soval is pitch perfect as Archer's main Vulcan foil. And what fan didn't love when Brent Spiner guest starred as Dr. Arik Soong over several episodes in the final season?<br /><br />I fully understand why \\"Enterprise\\" is either loved or hated by most fans. Lets face it, \\"Enterprise\\" is a show for the established Trek fan, it's not a show designed to bring in the casual viewer or to open up the Trek universe to a wider audience with all of the references to previous Trek shows and movies. I actually think \\"Enterprise' was ahead of it's time, in that most Trek fans were innundated with Trek product at the time. We had some version of \\"Star Trek\\" on tv for over two decades when \\"Enterprise\\" came on, \\"The Next Generation\\" feature films were still going strong (who knew \\"Nemesis\\" would make the end of the film series in 2002?) and when \\"Enterprise\\" sort of stumbled coming out of the gate, fans lost patience pretty quickly.<br /><br />I do recommend Trek fans give this show another shot. No, it's not perfect, and yes, there are some pretty bad shows here and there (but go back and try top watch the first 2 season of TNG sometime!!), but overall, it's a really good show, and deserves another look.Zombie Vulcan\\" episode, imaginitive episodes involving the Borg and several involving Augments as well, a couple of great \\"Mirror Universe\\" episodes and the fantastic finale.

142311339X|3.0|I couldn't wait to read this first book in the new spin-off series \\"Heroes of Olympus\\".  Instead, I found \\"The Lost Hero\\" to be a tiresome formula novel, with it's only purpose seeming to be to serve as a banal bridge to what will hopefully be a better second novel.  It took me a little over a week to spin through the entire Percy Jackson series.  It took me about the same time to read TLH, but only because I had to keep putting it down out of boredom.  Three new, critical characters are introduced in TLH, but none envoke any empathy, nor are even robust enough to generate like/dislike.  Jason is bland (partially attributable, perhaps, to the lost memory thing) and unremarkable for a hero (except, maybe, in looks).  Piper is a lame rebel (and the \\"Pipes\\" nickname...oh so cloying!!  Give it a rest!!) who spends the better part of the book trying to make herself unattractive, and yet frets incessantly about Jason being attracted to her.  Huh??  Leo Valdez is perhaps the most interesting of the three, somewhat amusing, loyal and resourceful (with the help of his magic toolbelt!), but even he becomes rather annoying in those recursive moments when raging teenage hormones cause him to find nearly every female...even those monsters!...attractive and desiring of him.  PL-eezzze.  As for Coach Hedge, I would gladly suffocate him with a 2000 lb. \\"cupcake\\"!  Such a far cry from endearingly goofy Grover!  And then there's the evil Drew...come on...what teenager calls another teenager \\"hon\\"?--that's for aging, gum-snapping waitresses on 50's TV shows!!  Honestly, the standout character for me was Festus, leaky ear and all!  He had more charm than Jason, Piper and Hedge put together!!    Nearly 100 pages could have been lopped from this book without appreciable deprication of the storyline.  Details are repeated ad nauseum.  Jason's lost his memory.  He thinks he's starting to like Piper, but he doesn't know if it's all right to like Piper...because he's lost his memory!  Piperthinks Jason is hot.  She wishes he would hug her.  Oh, yeah, and did I mention she thinks he's hot?  Leo started the fire that might have killed his Mom; he's stricken with guilt.  Any time fire is mentioned, so is this.  Piper's famous movie-star dad spends more time with his scripts and in the gym than he does with her.  Again, almost every chapter reiterates this in some way.  Halfway through the book I was silently screaming \\"WE KNOW! WE KNOW ALREADY!!\\".  Not sure why Riordan felt he had to bludgeon his readers with these various bits of information, but I hope he desists in book 2!!

0684833395|2.0|If I step back into my college nerd-geek mindset, I can appreciate this book for the attempts at humor.  To be sure, it's a simple humor, dressed up in pseudo-intellectualism; but it reminds me of some of my friends when they would make an odd comment simply for the sake of absurdity and then try to explain to me how what they said actually made total sense.  They were funny and quirky and fun.  However, they also had other moods and other traits, and my interactions with them were deeper than simple banter.  What this book suffers from is using a device too much.  To me, great artists - of any type - have a large toolbox.  They may not be masters at using every one, but they are knowledgeable and proficient with each.  But most importantly, they know when to use each one - or perhaps more to the point, when NOT to use each one.  In Catch-22, Heller picks up one brush (absurdity) and uses it endlessly, repeatedly, for 500 some pages.  This isn't masterful, and it almost comes across as an exercise, almost like a musical etude.  For me, the trick is not to find something great and use it endlessly.  That is sloppy and sophomoric.  The real mastery in any art is using a tool only where it has greatest effect, to moderate yourself and allow yourself to use other tools.  Otherwise, the effect you are aiming for loses its meaning and poignancy.  By being relentlessly absurd - granted some argue he was doing this purposefully to make us feel the absurdity - he's created an absurd book.  Kudos to doing what you set out to do, but that doesn't make the book itself \\"great\\".  Just my $0.02.

B001F12J0C|3.0|I would give the Trilogy five stars if not for the nauseating shaky cam during the fight and car chase scenes. It absolutely ruins the choreography. The shaking in the first movie is tolerable but in the last two it was chaotic. You don't know who's hitting or chasing who. You don't need to shake the camera so much or change scenes so fast to make the action more exciting. The car chase scene in \\"The French Connection\\" was a classic but it didn't use a shaky cam.
B004H83IG4|2.0|There seemed to be gaps between key events that left us thinking 'huh?' The characters have little depth, even the main ones by Gosling and Dunst. It's too bad, the story and the cast had such potential...
B005NPBTQ6|2.0|I read the other reviews of this album...10 so far...and I feel like maybe these folks are listening to a different album than I am.  A little background: I am a huge, huge, Ryan Adams fan.  I started with Whiskeytown, and when he went off by himself, loved his early albums and, frankly, have loved pretty much everything he has done since.  For a while, an acquaintance of mine played in the Cardinals.  My wife and I danced to \\"When the Stars go Blue\\" at our wedding. I am a bona fide RA junkie.  I wanted to like this album.  But I can't.  This album clearly finds Adams in love and content, and really plays like a valentine.  The problem is that the songs are well produced, well recorded, reasonably well sung...but the songs themselves stink.  There are only two songs where there is an actual melody that sticks with me after I've heard it\\" \\"Do I Wait\\" and \\"Lucky Now\\".  The rest are all meandering, downtempo, sweetly sung, well-itentioned ditties that never really arrive at a song.    Some of them jangle, and yeah, he sings with a twang that he hasn't in a while, but this is all surface fluff.  There is no melody.  There is nothing approaching the greatness of even the lesser tracks on his other albums. \\"Sweet Illusion\\" from Cold Roses?  \\"English Girls Approximately\\" from Love is Hell?  Nothing on this album really comes close.  I am happy that Ryan Adams is happy, but his edge and melodic sensibilities have lost out on this album.  It seems like it's RA scrubbed a little too clean and stripped of his essential strengths.  Hopefully his next outing will be better.
0385534639|5.0|This was absolutely one of the best STORIES that I have read in a very long time! Although the characters were wonderful, it was the DESCRIPTIONS of the characters, the tents, the grounds, the artwork, and the entire circus that make this novel such a wonderful read. Any reader with any imagination at all will find him or herself delighted by the imagery that the descriptions conjure. It is as though a movie could never, ever do this story justice.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Very fun a addictive game! There should be way more objectives to complete but still good. I highly recommend this game.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I loved this book.  However because the names were so similar I found I had to reread it to know who he was talking about.  I agree with one reviewer to spend time reading this book.  It cannot be read in 5 minute increments.  Also it is better enjoyed reading the trilogy in order.  I am sorry this is the end .  I would have enjoyed more books from Mr Larsson.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard app for fast texting. This keyboard is great! I wish there were more themes though.
B002QGUFWE|3.0|I am a Gaga fan but I guess not as much as I thought. For those of you that are great fans, I am sure you will like the CD.  Just not one of my favorites.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|Great!!! :) Almost every track is worth it, especially Lunar and Titanium. Best song on the CD would be Without You sung with Usher
B0050LJIRK|1.0|I was pretty excited when I heard that Limp Bizkit was coming out with a new album. After the album getting pushed back several times it was finally released. What a disappointment. For one Fred tries to be a rapper on almost every single song. I understand that they are considered \\"rap metal\\" or whatever you want to call it, but seriously Fred your rhymes are terrible. Second what kind of a band doesn't tour the US when they're album is released? Even though they're new album sucks I would still go see them live. Last of all no Fred we will not call you by your alias Polar Bear.
B005F3XV62|3.0|It is a good, but no a great, movie. However, in a landscape of mediocrity it shines, and it is not offensive.  The plot and storyline are simple, and at times predictable. This silly romantic comedy is valued as just entertainment.
0307595579|5.0|Received the box set promptly.  Still wrapped and in excellant condition. I was able to get the entire four books for the price of one at a book store.  Thanks for the set.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|The second book, The Wise Man's Fear, starts off with the slowest half of a book I have ever read.  I mean, literally nothing suspensful happens in the first half of the book.  It consists of Kvothe making things and playing music and chasing after Dena, very boring. The second half picks up, but very jumbled, jumping from one adventure to another. Was the book entertaining at times, yes!  However, don't expect a repeat of the first book, this one goes along at a snails pace and simply dwells on parts way too long.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Best writing I have ever witnessed in a show.  The acting is amazing as well, and hats off to everyone that made this show superbly Epic!  BUT, the true merit goes to the writers.  Genius!
B000QFW7UA|5.0|At last I can watch this movie, which is indeed very entertaining. Back in 80's when I played The Goonies game on my NES, I really enjoy this game. The background music and the story are very memorable. But I never have chance to watch the movie. I know it would be great, but this movie never been played in my country.  When I saw this blu-ray gift set on Amazon, I didn't take a long time to order it. Though it takes 1 month to delivered, I really excited. This great film with gift set box are wonderful.  Goonies never say die!

B00124QBP6|5.0|This album was the beggining of a new ERA in WESTERN civilization called DISCO. Jive Talking is my all time favorite Bee Gees tune. Americanization of 3 genius Australian brothers. Post Vietnam, Star Wars Generation's first contact with them and the rest is history.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|The main problem with this book is the same problem you find with all thrillers and mystery stories. It follows a formula, but I can't really hold that against the author since all great mystery writers usually follow a formula: Agatha Christie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as well as modern writers like James Patterson. Don't let the formula based plot deter you, if you have enjoyed past Jack Reacher novels then this is more of the same and you will probably like this one as well. If you haven't read a Jack Reacher novel before then I recommend going back to the first one and starting from there. Since I am already a fan of Lee Child then I'm probably a little biased, having said that, I enjoyed this book enough for it to make it into my top 5 stories and books that I would recommend from the kindle store.  My top 5, in no particular order, are:  1.The Affair by Lee Child  2.Arnie' Last Kill (novella) by Aleister Page  3.Abducted by T.R. Ragan  4.A Dozen Deadly Roses by Kathy Bennett  5.Emerald Moon by Rick Murcer
B002ZG9968|1.0|If you want to score romance points with that special someone, choose a different movie.    It's awful.  AWFUL!!!!  The only thing more macabre than seeing Mr. Cunningham in his final acting role was Maribeth Monroe's birthing scene. I would definitely fast forward through that.  Just gross!
B00000J7J4|5.0|I can think of 10 other Santana albums more deserving of the praise heaped upon this album by sales and awards.  Yes it IS a terrific Santana album, the first of its kind (if you want more then go for SHAMAN and ALL THAT I AM but don't coming running back to me for a Pepto Bismol when you are finished, I had my heartburn already).  Under the direction of the canny<br />Clive Davis, drawing Carlos into the arms of Arista, Santana found new fans in the demographically targeted younger music audience.  Thankfully for us, SUPERNATURAL still held enough material for older fans to garner our attention, and who in their right mind, no matter their age, does NOT like Dave Matthews or Matchbox 20?  And finally the two Guitar Gods met and held hands for over 8 minutes!  So, unlike the two sequels, at least this one was a promised gem with only a few warts.  Heed the words of one critic:  \\"there doesn't seem to be a track that doesn't have a guest star, which brings up the primary problem with the album [...] it never develops a consistent voice that holds the album together.\\" (S.T. Erlewine)<br /><br />Okay, it went over 15 times Platinum.  It won nine, count them, 9 Grammy Awards.  It sold over 27 million copies worldwide.  It debuted at #19 on Billboard and after 18 weeks of climbing from there it hit #1 and spent 12 weeks there!  Every promoted single from the album went to #1 and charted there for over 10 weeks. And more and more I need not go into!  The bottom line:  Clive Davis is a marketing genius, Carlos Santana is a living legend, and Arista was able to draw a veritable cornucopia of diverse hit artists together under one umbrella for a megaton moment in time!<br /><br />The Good:<br />\\"Yaleo\\", \\"Love Of My Life\\" with Dave Matthews, \\"Put Your Lights On\\" with Everlast, \\"Africa Bamba\\", \\"Smooth\\" with Rob Thomas, \\"Maria Maria\\" with Wyclef Jean, \\"Migra\\", \\"Corazon Espinado\\" with Man&aacute;, \\"El Farol\\", \\"Primavera\\", \\"The Calling\\" with Eric Clapton, and the \\"hidden track\\": \\"Day Of Celebration\\".<br /><br />The Bad:<br />\\"Do You Like The Way\\" with Lauryn Hill and Cee Lo Green is way too forced!<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />\\"Wishing It Was\\" with Eagle-Eye Cherry is just plain crap.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I can count more than 10 other Santana albums which are way superior to this one, I still give this one 5 full stars since the good is really good and the bad and ugly tracks can clearly be skipped over.  Incidentally, I will eventually fork out the bucks for the \\"Legacy\\" edition of this since it has more of what is \\"good\\".  If you are young, foolish, impetuous, or all three go ahead, buy SHAMAN, I am sure you will \\"like\\" it, you can probably drink a half dozen more Cuba Libre's than I can anyway which is what it would take to get through \\"The Game Of Love\\" one more time.<br /><br />Take the 5 Stars as gratis, but mark my words, the Art is out there in SANTANA, ABRAXAS, SANTANA (III), CARAVANSERAI, WELCOME, BORBOLETTA, MOONFLOWER, ZEBOP!, HAVANA MOON, BLUES FOR SALVADOR, SPIRITS DANCING IN THE FLESH, MILAGRO, and SANTANA BROTHERS.

B002ZG98C8|2.0|I loved the casting and the movie was beautiful for what it was; but just not my cup of tea.   I couldn't stand the gore; which I find odd because the over-the-top killing in Kill Bill or Rambo was fine with me.   So this film lacked something to keep me intrigued, but I still recommend trying it because I can see where some would love this film. If you liked Deathproof or any of the other two aforementioned movies, give it a whirl.
1423140591|2.0|I read the entire book the first day I got it and I have to say that I was seriously disappointed. Even though Percy is my favorite character I didnt think Frank and Hazel added ANYTHING to the story. I found myself dreading Percy's parts ending because I knew that I would then have to read 4 straight boring chapters about Frank and Hazel. They were far inferior to previous characters Leo and Piper.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|The Wolverine movie left a bad taste in my mouth.  After watching that, I thought \\"it's over.\\"  But no, I was in heaven watching this movie.   The *only* time I felt like I was coming down was when Kevin Bacon's character donned a certain clothing item; but then he made fun of himself and I was right back in it. It's so good.
B00065F86U|1.0|$200.00 plus for the grip this item should be included with the grip. I always read one star reviews, and this is one that is absolutely correct.   Nikon should at least sell two in the box so I can switch batteries quickly.  Hello Nikon, one in the box with grip, and/or sell them separately with two in the box!!!!
B001TODCII|3.0|SPOILERS:  I did like this movie, but I found it too formulaic for my tastes. It basically went like this:   1. Painstakingly explain to the audience our hero's penchant for attention to detail and love for his daughter   2. Go on mini-mission to foreshadow Bryan's (Liam's) ability for kicking butt.  3. Kidnap daughter and daughter's friend (whose sole purpose in the movie--btw--is to die)   4. Go rescue daughter   Items 3 and 4 are the meat of movie and what give it its entertainment value...but the road you take to get there is so long and boring. For instance, there is a scene in the beginning where Bryan carefully picks out an inexpensive present for his daughter and meticulously wraps it. The director clearly demonstrates Bryan's love for his daughter, lack of funds and attention to detail with this one scene. That's enough for us to get the gist, but now we have to experience a BBQ with his buddies who regurgitate what we already know...and badger him into a small mission so he can get some money. It was 20 minutes of the movie that could have been completely removed. Liam MAKES this movie. He is so great! Without him, this flick would've gone straight to video.
B005IS565S|5.0|Definatly worth buying. This is one of very few albums that you don't want to skip a song!!A little different from the first two albums, but still the same amazing 5FDP.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Ang Lee's Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece.   Within the first five minutes of the movie (which is, in fact, the opening credits), the backstory is fully and brilliantly illustrated. You should feel pathos towards Bruce when you witness his childhood and these emotions should continue the entire movie.   Bruce struggles with his feelings while he tries to determine and control what he really is.   It all culminates to the point where Bruce confronts his father (Nick Nolte) who, btw, gives a performance that is Oscar-worthy. The movie is serious (which, IMHO, all superhero movies should be) and takes the proper amount of time to define its characters.   Lee's cinematography treats the movie sometimes as if you were reading a graphic novel; you get multiple, simultaneous shots split across the screen. It's cool. You just have to bear in mind this movie is not like sitting in a rocket-ship. You need patience and allow yourself to become absorbed into Lee's universe.   By doing so, you will see the movie in the light it was meant too...and enjoy it.
B005F9CP7M|5.0|This album is definately one of the best albums of 2011! I highly recommend \\"The Sea\\" \\"Enemy\\" and\\" Think About It\\"
B001UV4XIS|5.0|You don't have to be a Potter-head to enjoy this movie.   It is fantastic and beautifully closes the story! I can't imagine there is someone who doesn't know how this story ends, but just in case, I won't spoil it.   However, I will say that the story (the whole Potter story) climaxes when you become privy to the life of a main character; it's a back-story that will absolutely bring tears to your eyes. If you missed it in the theater, then watch this on the best Home Video system you can find. It's incredible!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|amazing backpack at an amazing price.  i bought this to protect and carry my new canon t3i which i got w/ 3 lenses which all fit fine.  it also has enough space to hold my dv camcorder and the side straps wrap around a foldable tripod.  the flat pockets inside the main flap has a cool looking reflective shine to them but are still see-through enough to see what's inside.  the dividers can be moved to custom fit your components.  i also like the all-black color scheme rather than the canon backpack which has some camo/green color.
B005DC68NI|5.0|If you're thinking of self-publishing, this book is gold. Well-written, well-organized, piles of essential information for both USA and international authors, and lots of helpful links.<br /><br />If you only want to buy one book on how to self-publish, buy this one.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|My kid and I both love the movie, the umpa lumpa songs aren't as good but Depp is great as Willy Wonka

0439023521|3.0|It is very difficult, most of the time, to separate ones reaction to the setting from ones reaction to the story and characters. However, I think my reactions to this book can be divided rather sharply into these two categories.  The setting is incredibly stupid. Even though the author kept it fairly surreal I was never able to suspend my disbelief well at all. I have seen much better settings utterly demolished in reviews, especially on the SF newsgroups on UseNet. District Twelve, give me a break. Neither the Capitol or the districts make any sense at all. Nor does the proposed society.  It is all just an excuse to create the terrible, beautiful and eventful story. And the story is all that. I was never bored. When I was not being irritated unto death by the setting I was being propelled along by the characters and what was happening to them.  Speaking of the characters, some of the minor characters are extremely fine. To echo A. E. Houseman, \\"With Rue my heart is laden.\\" In fact that poem is appropriate when thinking of the young people, even the ones in whom the games brought out their worst natures, sactificed to this evil society.  When I just reviewed Michael Chabon's _Summerland_ (an even better juvenile) I mentioned the life lessons in the book. I think it is only fair to say that there are strong lessons in this book too. Lessons of loyalty and courage and also of not pre-judging people or at least not acting on those pre-judgments until you have a chance to see if they are wrong.  So I am giving the setting a one and the story a four. Which would average out to 2.5 but the story is more important.  I had expected some of the horrors of this setting to be redeemed in the sequel(s) Having read the first sequel, I think that is going to be true.
1400052181|5.0|Wonderful book and it should be read by all.It is important that the truth is told. The author Ms. Skloot shows that life is precious and we must be accountable for the things we do. This story impacts people all over the world. Generations of families. It is important to make it known to all. :)
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I haven't purchased this yet, but I've tried it before and, man, what an astounding app! This gem can answer virtually anything you throw at it, with precise results!  This blasts Cha Cha and others alike out of the water.  There are so many practical uses for using this ingenious app. I imagine a lot of students use this. I use it for just about everything. You name it, Wolfram  Alpha can solve it!  I hope to buy this soon as I have a lot of unanswered questions!   To those of you who may be hesitant on purchasing, you won't regret your decision for a second. At 99&cent;, it's a steal!   It's kind of like having Albert Einstein and the other greats at your disposable. Right in your pocket!
B003Y5H53S|4.0|this was an okay movie not the best but entertaining and I am sure little kids will love it more than adults.
B000000OA6|5.0|This is a priceless work of love and growth. You should not be without this Gift in your collection. My love to Bryan May, Roger Taylor And John Deacon for their love and devotion in the making of these works. Thank you for the privilege of my owning these incredible tracks. I am speechless regarding this music. May God Bless all 4 of you. Love you Freddie in heaven. [[ASIN:B000000OA6 Innuendo]]
B000K7UG34|5.0|this movie is the best war movie out of all that i saw....the only thing that comes close is HBO mini series THE PACIFIC
0061537969|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. Quick to start and finish, and you just don't want it to end. Laughed outloud and cried outloud as well.  I'm thinking my next pup will be named Enzo.  A great story. Highly recommend, even if you're not a dog lover.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Let me start off by conveying that this is not a movie for everyone.  Some will completely hate it- while others like me will love and cherish it.  This is a very deep movie, filled with symbolism and deep spirituality. True that there is not a lot of dialogue between the actors, but that is what makes this film unique.  Brad Pitt is very good in this film, as is the woman who plays his wife.  The kids are all great too.  The film even gets quite trippy at times a la  2001: A Space Oddyssey. I freely admit at times I had a hard time following the film as it jumps from the present, to the past, to prehistory, to the distant future. The cinematography is simply amazing. Blu Ray is a must for this film. If you're not a deep person, this film may not be for you.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I've been trying to expand my collection of music recently after getting a very good set of headphones.<br /><br />I managed to stumble on this album while looking for some other things, and liked the couple of samples that I listened to.<br /><br />I downloaded it right away, and found it to be a very fun album.  Laurie might not be the greatest singer out there, but he seems to truly enjoy what he's doing, and that spills over to the listener.<br /><br />I enjoy the album quite a bit, and look forward to hearing from Mr. Laurie again.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I usually don't like remakes,especially horror remakes but this was really good.Sure it was hard to watch at times but her getting revenge on these monsters at the end was worth the watch.Alot better than most horror movies out these days.
1416550550|5.0|I often have a hard time starting a new book directly after finishing another.  Once I am committed to characters and a story line, it becomes part of my waking and sleeping thoughts.  Tho I don't judge a book *entirely* by it's cover, this one drew me in.  I loved the artwork.  That and the synopsis were enough for me to begin.  Past that, it was the perfect length for investing in a mystery that takes 1/3 of the book to grasp.  I might've complained initially over that, except for the air of secrecy that the author wove from the first sentence and even into the formatting.  One might say that the character development takes a hit when jumping generations and oceans every chapter...to which I would have to agree.  But the mystery made up for any other deficiencies.  The longer you read, the deeper you find yourself in the maze.
B003AYPMBU|3.0|The whole package is unbelievable, but my only concern is that I could not play the Audio CD in any of my player/PC. Looks like the CD data is in a zipped format. If anyone knows what to be done to have this CD functional, do let me know!!!<br /><br />Selva
B004EPYZQC|5.0|all i can say it surpasses the previous sequels, great plot, great action, great cast, and a twist ending. fast and furious fans check this excellent well made movie out you'll love it!!
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Alex Petyfer is an up and coming actor with great potential. I look forward to seeing him in the sequel to this film and many other films that he will perform in. Of course, having a great supporting cast and a top director doesn't hurt either!
B000787WVK|5.0|Arrigo Boito remains one of the greatest librettists of all time and must be considered partially responsible for the enduring success of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra, Falstaff, and Otello as well as Ponchielli's La Gioconda. (Could one also wish for a recording of Pick-Mangiagalli's Basi e Bote to Boito's libretto?) His own (only completed) opera Mefistofele also remains popular but has tended to divide opinion. Although I don't think it is musically an unqualified masterpiece it is a splendid work - dramatically as well as musically effective, and as a take on Faust I find it in the more compelling than Gounod's; yes, Gounod has the more immediately memorable individual numbers (and I suppose Gounod knew a trick or two with respect to creating an effective stage work), but Boito's work is by some distance more overall convincing as a musical work, and unsurprisingly sports the better libretto.  I guess this star-studded Decca recording would be the one to have as well, though I admit that I am not overly familiar with the alternatives. To a large extent the success is due to the orchestral and choral performances. The National Philharmonic Orchestra plays beautifully under Olivier de Fabritiis, who truly has the measure of the work - it is wonderfully dramatically paced, full of color, gorgeous textures, poetry, life and vigor, superbly balanced and generating plenty of momentum. The choral forces (Trinity Boys Choir and the London Opera Chorus) are equally excellent both in terms of beauty and drama, and the Decca recording warm and full-blooded.   The rhetorically obvious next step in a review would be to admit that the soloists comprise something of a mixed bag, but despite some minor objections this is really not the case. Yes, most of the major roles were taken by singers who at the time must count as \\"experienced\\", but there is plenty of youthful vigor in the singing as well. Pavarotti is an excellent, passionate Faust, displaying deep understanding of the role,emotionally as well as musically, as well as sensitivity to his partners in the duets and ensemble roles (the occasional hard top note is easily forgiven). My admiration for Freni remains unchallenged as well, even though she sometimes appears to be forced to work a little too hard for her voice; there is plenty of fire and drama left in the voice, however, as well as sensuousness, richness and beauty of tone. Caballé is a delight; breathtaking high notes and ravishing elsewhere.   Ghiaurov in the title role is masterly. If I were in a sourer mood I could have pointed out that some of his high notes are not ideally soft or full, but it's hard to put any weight behind that criticism insofar as he is utterly compelling everywhere else. He is really something of an ideal Mefistofele (though some may, I admit, prefer a slightly more subtle approach to the role), bitingly sarcastic, jeering, yet mysterious and complex - and thoroughly wicked. All the smaller roles are good as well, and the final verdict must be that this is really an astounding success of a recording; enthusiastically recommended.

B000002UA2|4.0|I like to think of this album as a Floyd album for those who don't like Floyd. There are those who don't want the weird trippy Syd Barrett era just as there are those who don't like Floyd's later years when Roger Waters was consumed with anger and angst about his father's death, consumerism, sex, and so on. The point of this is if Pink Floyd ever made an album that could be considered mainstream, Obscured By Clouds would be it. It opens with two short, dramatic but pretty straightforward instrumentals with main themes accented with Gilmore's classic guitar work. Then we have the first track with lyrics, \\"Burning Bridges\\" which has it's slightly trippy but very laid back lyrics, very simple and mellow. For me, it's the fourth track, \\"The Gold It's In The ...\\" that's the gem, probably one of the most radio friendly songs that Floyd ever recorded. You would expect to hear it's driving beat and cheery lyrics of travel and adventure cranked up with the top down on a convertible \\"over the mountains and across the seas\\" with Gilmore's blues guitar work front and center with the songs second half. \\"Wots ... Uh The Deal\\" is a pretty ballad being wanted to be welcomed and comforted after a long journey. Doesn't seem to matter if it's metaphorical or literal. It even features a lovely piano solo near the end, a sort of rarity for a Pink Floyd album. \\"Mudmen\\" shares a similar theme found in Burning Bridges except it's instrumental and in 4/4 time as apposed to the 3/4 time signature in Burning Bridges. The solos keep the track moving along and never seem to be too much or out of place. \\"Childhood's End\\" starts with an ominous chord and tick tock percussive sound and song which might be a precursor to Time on what would be their next album, Dark Side Of The Moon. \\"Free Four\\" is the first track in which we finally hear Roger Waters' reference regarding his father's death in a foxhole in the World War (\\"You are the angel of death, and I am the dead man's son) despite upbeat shuffle which often gets referred to \\"Spirit In The Sky\\". We then get Stay, another lovely comforting ballad before Absolute Curtains wraps up the album as the track with an odd instrumental that feature a tribe chanting from a New Guinea which I found a bit grating after a while. Then again, the tribe is featured in the French film, The Valley for which the album was made for, so maybe it's appropriate. You won't find a Pink Floyd album that's easier to listen to than Obscured By Clouds.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Top Gun is the story of elite U.S. Navy Fighter Pilots and their quest to be the most distinguished graduates from the Top Gun special training school. I first saw this movie when I was eight years old, and a career as a Fighter Pilot became an instant desire. This film is filled with edge of the set exhilaration, and contains some of the best camera work of supersonic jet action for a motion picture. There are several valuable undertones to this movie which includes camaraderie, competitiveness, and professional pride towards military duty. Top Gun is an action packed film that will forever remain exciting.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Very classic, final fantasy-esque game play. It's a fun &amp; intuitive rpg with all the elements you'd expect from a classic rpg. Leveling doesn't take too long &amp; bosses aren't too overpowered.

B004A8ZWWE|5.0|Real Steel, directed by Shawn Levy, is one of the very few movies I've seen in recent years where the audience I was in actually broke into applause in various scenes.  A masterfully done tale of underdogs - a boy and his dad and a discarded robot - going against the odds, it really does get you pumped up to that level.  I got a bigger kick out of this movie than I have from any other this year.  It really is that much fun to watch.<br /><br />The germ idea for Real Steel comes from a 1956 short story by Richard Matheson that was made into a classic Twilight Zone episode, and the look is right out of the Transformers franchise, but the heart - and there's a lot of it in this film - comes in equal measure from two films one would ordinarily have never linked together:  John Avildsen's boxing classic Rocky (1976) and Peter Bogdanovich's Depression-era con-man & kid road trip classic Paper Moon (1973).<br /><br />The plot is set in the not so distant future of 2020, where human boxing has been completely displaced by robot boxing.  Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a former boxer who now gets by \\"managing\\" a robot boxer named Ambush, is about as down on his luck as it gets.  Deep in debt and barely able to keep Ambush functional, Charlie is reduced to working the fringes of the boxing circuit and even exhibiting Ambush in county fairs where he puts the robot up against things like wild bulls. Which turns out to be a really bad idea when Ambush ends up getting smashed to pieces by a bull that weighs almost three times what he had agreed to, leaving Charlie fleeing in his van afterwards to avoid the exhibition promoter (Kevin Durand) to whom he now owes twenty thousand dollars.  In this opening scene, we learn two things that tell us why Charlie is in the straits he's in: (1) he frequently makes really bad decisions, especially when he's desperate, and (2) he lets himself get distracted instead of keeping his mind on what he's doing - a bad thing to have happen when your robot is fighting a two-and-a-half ton bull.<br /><br />Shortly after this disaster, while wondering how he's going to be able to afford another robot, Charlie unexpectedly finds out that an old ex-girlfriend of his has died, leaving behind an eleven-year-old boy named Max (Dakota Goyo), a son Charlie hasn't seen since he was an infant.  Thinking that it's just a matter of signing over custody to the boy's aunt Debra (Hope Davis) and her new husband Marvin (James Rebhorn), Charlie shows up at the courthouse, only to quickly realize that Marvin is rich and that the opportunity he's been needing has landed right in his lap.  Abruptly seeming to change his mind about signing the boy over, Charlie privately talks Marvin into an agreement where he'll give up custody rights to the boy, but only for $100K.  Not wild about adopting Max to begin with, Marvin grudgingly agrees, but only on the condition that Charlie keep the boy for the next three months so that the kid doesn't interfere with his plans for their summer vacation in Europe.  Charlie, not wild about being saddled with a kid, reluctantly agrees, getting half the money up front, the other half to be handed over when he delivers the kid at the end of the summer.  The deal done, Marvin departs with Debra, leaving Charlie face-to-face with Max for the first time.  And clearly, neither of them are thrilled by this arrangement.  Max is even less thrilled when he finds out that he's been \\"sold\\" to his aunt and uncle and angrily demands that Charlie give him half the money.  Which Charlie can't because he's already spent most of it buying a replacement robot named Noisy Boy.  Seem familiar?  It's right out of Paper Moon, as are some other key moments in the film.)<br /><br />Charlie takes Max to an old boxing gym that now serves largely as a repair shop for robot boxers, run by his friend Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lily).  The two of them have history together as Bailey's father was Max's trainer back in the days when Max was a boxer and the boxing gym was still a boxing gym.  Bailey knows Max better than he knows himself, and she's the first one to recognize just how much Max and Charlie are alike.  But the similarities quickly come out when Noisy Boy is delivered and Max stares at the robot with fanboy adoration, rattling off a string of fight statistics that even Charlie wasn't aware of.  He also turns out to know the Japanese commands needed to operate Noisy Boy from all of the video games he's played.<br /><br />Things finally seem to be looking up and Charlie gets an old fight promoting friend Finn (Anthony Mackie) to get Noisy Boy on the evening's fight card at the local arena.  But once again, Charlie's hopes are dashed by bad decisions and not keeping his mind on what he's doing.  Faced with once again having to try to come up with a robot but with no money to pay for one, Charlie takes Max along as he night-raids a junkyard looking for robot parts.  As they wander through the place in the dark and the rain, Max falls off the edge of a pit and is barely saved when he's snagged on the exposed arm of a buried junked robot.  Excited over having found an entire robot, Max insists on digging him out, which Charlie wants no part of.  Hours later, when the sun is finally rising, we see a worn-out and thoroughly mud-bedraggled Max hauling the recovered robot back to the van where Charlie is waiting.  Max just glares at his father for a moment, then starts hitting and kicking at him in a blind, exhausted and exasperated fury.  The scene is absolutely priceless.<br /><br />Back at the gym, Max sets about cleaning up the salvaged robot, an older-gen sparring `bot built to take massive punishment but not to deal it out. He discovers that the `bot is named Atom, and that Atom has a shadow mode where he copies the movements of whoever is operating him.  Max, convinced that Atom can take on actual boxer robots and win, pesters Charlie until Charlie finally arranges for Atom to get a match in an unsanctioned off-the-grid makeshift outdoor arena. In spite of himself, Charlie gets caught up in Max's dogged determination and enthusiasm and the two begin working together. From there on, the film shifts into Rocky mode and its Charlie and Max and their underdog robot Atom going up against the odds.<br /><br />The supporting cast is superb.  Evangeline Lilly's Bailey is quite convincing as a woman who knows Charlie well enough to care about him but to be wary of him at the same time.  The same holds true for Anthony Mackie's Finn, who lets Charlie talk him into match-ups that he knows are a bad bet but he can't prevent from happening. Kevin Durand's Ricky is affably ruthless as a \\"good ol' boy\\" promoter who gets Charlie in hock and then takes it out of his hide later.  John Gatins (who wrote the screenplay) brings over-the-top trash-talk bravado to his pierced and mohawked Kingpin, the manager of the robot Atom is first put up against.  And Karl Yune and Olga Fonda are pitch perfect as Tak Mashido and Farra Lemkova, the arrogant brains and ice-cold business savvy behind the reigning World Robot Boxing League champion, Zeus, the ultramodern engine of destruction that Max, Charlie and Atom must ultimately face.<br /><br />And the robots themselves are impressive.  Not mere CGI fabrications, twenty-six animatronic robots were created for the movie.  A combination of CGI and the simul-cam motion capture technology developed for Avatar was used for the scenes where you see the robots moving independently or fighting in the ring.  Each boxing robot has a distinctive look and feel tailored to suggest varying levels of sophistication and menace. Everything about Atom, on the other hand, symbolizes the underdog nature of Charlie and Max.  Older generation, less sophisticated, more scarred and far less shiny, and a little smaller than most of the robots he's put up against, Atom also has soft blue-oval eyes that subtly suggest empathic connection.  There's no sentience behind them, no artificial intelligence, but Atom nonetheless \\"sees\\" Max and Charlie, and in him they see themselves.<br /><br />But the heavy lifting rests on the chemistry between Hugh Jackman's Charlie and Dakota Goyo's Max.  Hugh Jackman's Charlie is spot on, a subtle portrayal of a man always reaching for the brass ring - and always tripping himself up before he can grab it.  Jackman brings this out beautifully - you can see the desperate agony on his face each time when Charlie realizes the brass ring is slipping away from him yet again.  But something nonetheless keeps Charlie going on, something inside him just won't let him quit, and Jackman brings out that side of him as well. Dakota Goyo's Max is a younger - and very possibly smarter - Charlie that life hasn't beaten down yet.  He is that voice inside Charlie that won't let him give up.  And in Max, Charlie finds himself all over again.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.n spite of himself, Charlie gets caught up in Max's dogged determination and enthusiasm and the two begin working together.

B00005JKHP|4.0|After my son encouraged me to read these reviews I purchased the Directors Cut given this movie, I once thought of as a bore, another chance. Well, I must admit the Directors Cut is a major improvement that makes ST-TMP worthwhile. To be honest I still find it a little boring. Yet I couldn't stop thinking about it. This movie has a lot more to it then I originally thought. The storyline is more interesting now and there's the sub story about Spocks enlightenment as well as other important historical information you don't want to miss.   Back to the boring part. My family having viewed it with me were not as excited about it. So I decided to see if it would be possible to skip the long drawn out scenes. This is what I found. You can skip chapter 19 & 20 and easily continue the movie without a hitch. Wow, the movie becomes more focused and clear. And something else, the visual effects which were always stunning now pop.  Here's why. Chapter 19 (Entering the Cloud) is the chapter other reviewers talk about where you see each of the crew stare into the cloud with goofy faces. Its almost five full minutes of a laser light show that lulls you into numbness. If you are still awake after that you are treated to chapter 20 (The Alien Vessel). This is four minutes  of exterior fly-by shots of the alien. This whole scene is done in a hypnotic deep dark blue cast. A total of almost 10 minutes is spent on chapter 19 & 20 combined which leaves you completely desensitized to any more visual effect stimuli. I mean it. If you skip these two chapters the visual effects in the rest of the movie really are enhanced.  Don't think you'll be missing out either. Chapter 22 will treat you to plenty of  eye candy while inside the alien vessel. It does the grand job of given the impression of its vastness that 19 & 20 intended to do. Also you don't have to quickly jump over 19 & 20. You can enter each scene for a few moments and then skip.  Now I can say I am very please to have this movie which I previously neglected.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Pros: Much cooler playing it on a tablet (Motorola Xoom)<br />Cons: No endless survival and the other bonus games just end. Also no Zen Garden.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|For the most part, I actually agree with a lot of the negative things being said about this release (price, mixed-up packaging - meaning 2 disks in sleeves and the rest attached to the bottom of the box, the scarves, etc). However, I think people are missing the big picture here. I would not consider myself a fanatic but I do consider myself a huge Pink Floyd fan. I have plenty of CD's videos, books, etc but it is all formally released. And there lies the difference between the 4-5 star ratings and the 1 star ratings. Here is what I find deserving of 4 stars  1) 2011 remaster version on disk 1. I am NOT an audiophile. As a matter of fact, I am partially deaf and probably won't give much attention to disk 3 (Quad mix, 5.1 Surround). However, with this version, I am hearing things I don't recall hearing on my previous 'normal' version. It's my opinion, but this is just an excellent version of Dark Side of the Moon.  2)Live at Wembley in 1974 on disk 2. As mentioned above, I pretty much have only formally released material so this is an absolute gem for me. I've never heard any of it and I think the performance is just incredible.  3) Disk 4:  -Live In Brighton 1972: Careful With That Axe, Eugene & Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun - never saw it. Brilliant.   -The Dark Side Of The Moon, 2003 documentary - Never saw it. Not exactly stuff you have not heard elsewhere but it is new to me.   -Concert Screen Films (British Tour 1974, French Tour 1974, & North American Tour 1975). I figured I would like these but assumed they were going to be the same. Imagine my surprise to find quite a few differences, even between the 1974 versions.  4) Disk 6: What can I say, it is all unreleased and all just amazing. I love the Alan Parsons mix. I had never heard the Travel sequence in this format. The Hard Way is slightly disappointing musically but in retrospect, I don't think I could have expected anything else. Everything is just perfect on this disk.   I do like the Jill Furmanovsky photo book even given its size. Yes, I like the marbles. I also like the backstage pass and ticket replicas.   So, why not 5 stars considering all the positives? Well, it does boil down to some of the things others have complained about and mentioned above in my review. The price is still too high, the packaging of the disks is questionable at best, and the scarves are just a weird thing to throw in. I'm also surprised by the lack of the original material from the vinyl release years ago (although I have copies in pristine condition).   I would rate this 5 stars if the price was about $75 and they cleaned up the packaging.  This release has proved one thing to me though. When these were announced, I put all three sets in my shopping car. Now, after seeing what they did, I will just be buying the Experience versions of Wish You Were Here and The Wall.
B000E6G658|4.0|Beware the title.  If you think you might be getting the complete recordings of The Animals that would be a mistake.  But this will get you started.  It does contain some material that you won't see elsewhere.  That said you need to buy Animalisms to fill in the later, post Alan Price period before Eric's swelled head led him to form  the group that  recorded such classics? as San Franciscan Nights.

0316017930|1.0|I am an avid reader of self development/motivational books but this one did not meet the mark in any way. I bought a copy of the 'Outliers' at the airport during a recent trip. I normally do not sleep during flights....this was a 3 hour flight and the book was a great sleeping aid!!! I fell right asleep from boredom just after Chapter 3.    The stories/illustrations were overanalyzed, overstretched and beaten to death with no real substance to it. For instance, why go on and on about Chris Langan only to make a simple point afterall....most of the stuff written about Chris Langan should be in Chris' Biography and do not belong in this book! In my opinion, the entire book was 'much ado about nothing' or much ado about very little.  The only two chapters I enjoyed were the 10,000 hour rule which simply boils down to a commonsense approach of 'Practice makes perfect' and the chapter on KIPP Academy.  I was so demotivated and bored by the time I got to the end of it. Really, I want my money back!
B005IS565S|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch delivers again. This album is exactly what i expected from them this time around.  some of the songs are a little different than what we are used to, but they still sound like FFDP.  Great Albu, thanks guys
0312945973|5.0|I am not usually one to read books, but once in awhile when I lay my hands on a good one; I have a hard time putting it down. This is one of those books.  It tells an amazing tale, and despite some of it being long-winded I find myself enjoying even those segments and wanting to see what the author shapes next with these tales, as each does a marvelous job of springing to life the very Egypt he is writing of.  Wilber Smith's writing is powerful. He can take the simplest of motions - such as rowing a boat over the Nile's dark waters - and turn it into something vigorous and exciting.  For anyone who appreciates Egyptian history, or a tale filled with drama and character development, I would suggest giving this book a read.

I HAVENT GOTTEN THROUGH THE ENTIRE CD AS OF YET BUT ITS DEFINITELY MET MY EXPECTATIONS. HOW I MISSED THEIR SOUND! DEFINITELY WAS WORTH THE WAIT. TO ME THE SOUND IS MORE A GREAT COMBINATION OF FALLEN AND THE OPEN THE DOOR. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.
B005AUWY90|2.0|I just can't understand why Disney/Pixar would produce a movie that is designed for 2-5 year old boys that is overrun with violence.  Explosions, shooting... they even torture and kill (kill off-screen) Rod Torque Redline.  Cars 1 was filled with heart.  It was about friendship and small-town living.  This is a James Bond movie with cartoon cars in place of actors.  My 3 year old son was so excited to see this movie.  Mater's Tall Tales is better than this movie.
B004GAY2GS|5.0|As a avid fan of Ian Anderson's work both in and outside Jethro Tull I was happy to  see the \\"rerelease\\" of this album. I find it to be a \\"connecting piece\\" between Broadsword and the Beast and Under Wraps. In fact, W.I.L. has many \\"themes or motifs\\"  that remind me of the co-penned songs on Under Wraps. Ian's voice is in top form.  The songs have enough \\"Andersonisms\\" to keep me very interested and even though some  of the synth textures may date the album, I find the useage here very musical and tasteful. Ian's music can sometimes \\"put one off\\" at first because he doesn't just repeat past albums' formula.One should remember that the veast majority of Beatles fans were \\"put off\\" by their albums from Rubber Soul forward because they werent just writing pop songs anymore. As I have said in the past...some Tull fans seem to want Ian to write\\"Aqualung Parts 2-20...lol). I find it suprising  that fans expect this considering the \\"forward looking\\" philosophy of Mr.Anderson. If you have been on the fence regarding this album...do yourself a favor and pick it up.The performances are wonderful...the sound quality is excellent and the songs infectious.

B00009Z574|5.0|Having been a Yes fanatic for 40+ years I was disappointed to read some of the downright hateful reviews of this album.  This was a top 10 charting album. True, the band was going through stress and tribulations just prior to Rick and Jon leaving, but anyone who knows Yes realizes the different creative aspects of sheer genius that makes this band and the evolution of their music more like an mutating organism rather than simply a sonic dimensional measure.  This work offers a diverse collection of very upbeat mood and lyrical stylings. Please, lose the hate! Don't Kill the Whale--trite? Really? This statement of consciousness was both valid and visionary, not to mention a pretty darn good tune.  We're talking 1977 here, people!  Release release is a great rocker by any standard. Onward is some of the best bass line ever ripped out by Chris.  Madrigal is a nice happy song.  Arriving UFO and Circus of Heaven, although heavy with concept are decent efforts. The better news is that Bonus Tracks abound on the CD re-release! Abilene, Money, Picasso, Countryside, Some Are Born, High, Everybody's Song, the church hymm-like You Can Be Saved, plus more, and even a hidden track of an orchestral rendering of Onward are absolute gems! Rick may have thrown a tomato at the album cover art photo of Yes Tor back in '77, but don't let this unbelievably great buy get away! The price of this CD is a bargain just for the bonus cuts alone! A must for every collector. LOVE!
B004P7CMUU|5.0|So often actors' roles become predictable when their names are known.  The performances and the characters were excellent by the lead experienced actors.  While such is always expected from Hopkins, Kidman, Harris and Sinise, the nature of these roles were challenging.  A must see for fans of any or all of these performers.
1451629184|5.0|I am not one who sits and reads for relaxation, but I have always been captivated by Jaycee Duggard's story.  I picked a copy of \\"A Stolen Life\\" while on vacation and couldnt put it down.  I read the entire book in 1 day.  When I returned to work, I told some of my co workers about it and they have all began reading it as well.  I think I liked the book because it is in Jaycee's words, it is written nicely, but she does not sugar coat anything.  You can only imagine what hell this girl has been thru.  Totally recommend it!

0062011847|5.0|Pratchett's latest is marvelous as usual. Once more we have a tale of Sam Vimes, Commander of the Watch, husband to Lady Sybil, father to young Sam, now facing exile from the dark streets of Ankh-Morpork to.... a vacation at his vast country estate, Lady Sybil's childhood home.<br /><br />Fresh air! Wildlife! Bucolic vistas!  But how is a copper able to stop being a copper long enough to relax? Especially when faced with a horde of servants, visits from the local gentry, and a round of dinners and fancy dress balls? For as Vimes often says, where there's a policeman, there's crime - and the unaccustomed lifestyle of an unwilling country aristocrat is no match for the lessons of the street in the dark and the danger.<br /><br />The story is classic Vimes, with a twist. He's become more than just a policeman these days, like it or not. The hero of Koom Valley, a power respected by kings, the standard setter for police forces everywhere - Vimes is still getting used to the long shadow he casts. Fortunately he has Lady Sybil to keep him grounded, and Willikins his manservant to watch his back.<br /><br />And watching is needed, because Vimes' instincts soon tell him there's something going on, something the locals know but won't talk about. What follows is an entertaining tale of unraveling a brutal crime in the quest for justice, interspersed with Pratchett's wry take on the foibles of sapient beings. There's an evocation of Jane Marple's deceptively innocent seeming rural England, a poke at Jane Austen - and a writer of children's books who has opened young Sam's eyes to the wonders of Poo!<br /><br />Before Vimes vacation is done, he  will have unraveled a criminal conspiracy stretching from Quirm to Ankh-Morpork and the realms of the Low King and Diamond King of Trolls; wrestled with his own inner demons; faced death and a raging river; and brought justice and the rule of Law to those desperately in need of it whether they like it or not.<br /><br />And he'll also get a drink named after him.<br /><br />Enjoy!

0385344325|5.0|We can hardly wait for each new Jack Reacher novel from author Lee Child - we've read all sixteen to date in order and invariably love them. Indeed, we insist that Reacher is one of the most outstanding mystery/thriller fictional characters of the last twenty years, right up there with Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport, Alex Cross, and JP Beaumont. Not surprisingly, there is nothing to disappoint in \\"The Affair.\\"<br /><br />The plot takes us back in time (to 1997) to Reacher's last mission as an Army MP (in the rank of Major) - he's already out of the service in the rest of the books. He has been sent as an individual, undercover, to a small Mississippi town next to an Army base, the town's sole support, to \\"keep the locals under control\\" as a murder investigation unfolds that might involve military personnel from the base. Meanwhile an official investigator has formally been sent to the base, but it's Reacher that uncovers a much more involved set of killings and other suspect events. While our hero was quickly \\"made\\" by the local Police Chief, Elizabeth Deveraux, it's only because she's ex-Marines and was anticipating the arrival of someone like him. Reacher and Deveraux proceed to work the cases together, spending some quality time late at night on other matters!<br /><br />As with virtually all Child's novels, the pace with which our resourceful protagonist uncovers the truth and his incredible self-defense skills and brainpower come to play in a gripping and elaborately suspenseful tale. We wonder till almost the last page whether justice will prevail and what will happen to Reacher's career. This \\"Affair\\" is for sure another terrific entry in the set and is enthusiastically recommended!

If you have a bad disc and have waited too long, WB doesn't care.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Ok not gonna give it low rating because I knew what I was getting but words and videos cannot describe how humongous this knife is! Good steel cool looking knife should last forever, if all your gonna do is chop wood then for sure this is the one. Gonna take a while to get used to it but can't forsee this on my hip for any length of time, we shall see, maybe it will grow on me, reservations about this one though.
B005NPCJ88|4.0|The Way of the Fist was an awesome introduction and I really liked the versatility displayed in War is the Answer. But this album just doesn't have that extra something the other two had. Don't get me wrong it is good, but I feel like a lot of the songs sound pretty similar and there are a couple songs I really don't care for on this new album (unlike the last two albums).  If you like FFDP then you will probably like this album, but I think it is the weaker of the 3 (which is more a testament to how good the first two albums were than how this one is).  -update-  After a few listens through a few of the songs have grown on me. If you liked the other albums definitely get this one. I still don't like it as much as the other two but it is another solid album so I nudged this up a star.
1891252089|5.0|I have found this book very useful as a reference.  I am currently taking an Ashtanga yoga class.  I can't imagine using the book without the knowledge/experience I get from class.  However, it has been very useful as a reference book at home.  For example, the other day I wanted to know where exactly my hand should be in a particular pose...I was quickly able to find the pose and hand position.  A book is no substitute for a class with a qualified instructor but this is very helpful for home practice.

B003ZMF26W|1.0|I've been using Microsoft side winder mouse since 2007, and since the mouse started to \\"lose\\" it i started to read some reviews about gaming mouses and found this having good ratings, i can simply say that i was fooled, using this mouse is painful, really, i with all it's customization features and etc, it surely looks good, but the design is just bad, they didn't put their thoughts maybe on it because it causes a real pain to my hand after using it and i keep doing small massage to my hand :/ and besides of that? their config software just suck. it's not user friendly at all, i wish i get money back on this, i didn't regret buying anything in my life more than buying this mouse.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|When I first read online this movie was coming out I had mixed emotions. I remembered watching every anime episode before going to school in the late 70's. I wondered how could they capture the first season, twenty-six twenty-plus minute shows, in two plus hour movie... They did a fairly good job.  Space Battleship Yamato is not a bad attempt in recreating that early space opera feel in two plus hours. The CG effects are good, the acting is better than expected and the action was not bad at all so I was glad about that. Yes, much of what was in the TV show is not in the movie but I expect that.    This DVD is subtitled and from what I've read about other subtitled versions on DVD, it's pretty good subtitling. I could have waited for a dubbed version to be released, which I often do, but didn't.   I gave the movie four stars of out five because I did not like how the story line played out in the end. I won't give away what happens but I believe the writers could have done it better. Yes Earth is saved but we knew that was going to happen anyway if you've seen the original show.   So all-in-all, this version of Space Battleship Yamato is worth owning if you were a fan of the original Star Blazers or not.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this story. I was able to get lost in the beautiful pictures the words painted and the love story that unfolded.
0131103628|5.0|This book is the standard on C from the inventors of the C language.  It is exhaustive and well written but not a book for beginning programmers.  This book got me a job at Intel.  I read it on the airplane on my way over to Phoenix for an interview.  Two weeks before I had written a program that in a loop multiplied a number by (c/2 != ++c/2) to both increment and select a value.  This worked fine compiled under GNU C with the debugging flag on.  As soon as I turned on the optimizer on the compiler it stopped working.  According to the book, the order in which items in an equality or inequality operator are executed are compiler dependent.  As it turns out the optimizer would reverse the order of these operations when turned on.  This is the kind of attention to detail that this book has.  It covered even this arcane example, yet it's a thin easy to read well index text.  Any and every C or C++ programmer serious about what they do should own this book.  I own several copies.  During the technical part of my interview I was given a challenge problem that included the increment operator on one side of an equality operator as part of the computation.  I told the interviewer that he would get two different results depending on whether or not he used the optimizer during compilation.  As we passed his cubicle I saw him compiling the test problem and checking to see if what I had said was right.  Despite the fact that I showed up late for my interview and the receptionist had told me upon my arrival \\"Why did you even bother showing up?\\", not only did I get offered the position,  but I was offered a higher salary than the rest of the candidates that passed the interview.  I ended up taking a position in Southern California instead but definitely appreciate the fact that I was able to learn some very important information about the C language on the airplane ride over to Phoenix from this book.  One final note.  This last week has been a very sad week for the computing industry.  We lost a couple of amazing innovators, among them Dennis Ritchie.  While he may not get as much press his contribution to the world of computing runs far deeper than most people are aware of.  If Steve Jobs were alive he would most certainly acknowledge the passing of a great man whose contribution is the life blood of just about every computing device on the planet, past, present and likely in to the future.  This book is not only an amazing reference but a part of history and I am happy that several copies, some dog eared and marked, grace my bookshelf.
0618918248|5.0|As neither theist nor atheist, it was interesting to take a look at the atheist rock star's best effort at 'proving' there is no more in heaven and earth that is dreamt of in science's philosophy.<br /><br />Dawkin's writing meanders from maudlin to faux scientific to childishly spiteful, but never does he come close to proving anything---except, of course, to the scientific faithful, to whom no proof is necessary.<br /><br />Chapter six was my personal favorite. Here he promises to explain why atheists should be moral and not only fails, but never even addresses the core issue: why, in a world where everything extant can be quantified, where consciousness is mere firing of neurons and life itself has meaning only in so far as it relates to survival, should we do the right thing, be merciful, kind, moral, etc.?<br /><br />His unintentionally humorous answer? Because it helps us survive. That's why meercats warn their neighbors says man of science, Dawkins. His proof? Games theory and computer modeling and, in purely circular reasoning, of course, Darwin himself. Really. That's it.<br /><br />A confused and ramshackle mess of taunts, unfounded claims, nonsequitors and nonreason, this book proves that even supposedly logical, educated people are unable to look at this topic without allowing their emotions to rule them, as demonstrated by the many rave reviews below.
B000JBXLOM|4.0|DVD audio with 5 or 7 channel music...is not real music listening experience but a gimmick. This is not the right place to discuss, but as this is a popular album i am writing to enlighten most people. 2 channel creates a true image of the recording. Anything more will distort the true experience. Its like adding fake colors to cinematic movie experience. You will love it until you see the original. The biggest drawback with two channel is that you need a real good music system to create the soundstage very accurately which no multi channel can match. Probably 95% of people have never heard what i mean by soundstage. I would reccommend every one visit a high-end stereo (not best buy or frys) retail store in your area.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Definitely worth buying. The difficulty increases well and the music really adds to the feel of the game. Can't wait for the next one.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This edition of Star Wars brings the sharpness of a Blue-Ray image with the additions and polishing of the revisions. For example, we Jabba the Hut in the first (IV- I mean the first to appear). Ewoks are even more appealing. I recommend it for all Star Wars fans.
B000002NFM|4.0|With two fantastic albums under their belt, it could only have gone downhill for The Prodigy. And in a way, it sort of did. Cos although FOTL is by far the most famous Prodge album (I won't say 'commercial' cos it's as far from the mainstream as you can get), in my opinion it's the second worst, after AONO. However, don't forget, this is The Prodigy, and FOTL is still a QUALITY album!  Whereas Experience and Jilted were almost purely instrumental, FOTL includes the two lunatics Keith and Maxim a lot more. First track Smack My B**** Up, recently voted the most controversial song of all time, is an ear-splitting techno rampage with MCing from Maxim and a euphoric female vocal across the bridge that'll blow your mind. Next comes Breathe, the band's second UK number one and second single off the album. It's one of the darkest electronic tunes ever, with input from both Keith and Maxim over a furious breakbeat and whipcracks. Diesel Power is the band's second attempt at hip-hop after Jilted's Poison, with some fantastic rapping from Ultramagnetic MCs' Kool Keith. Funky S*** is the first purely instrumental track with a sprinkling of Beastie Boys samples, and Serial Thrilla is led by Keith's cockney growling. Mindfields is pure Maxim, and Narayan is unlike anything ever heard before - hardcore electro mixed with religious chants. Then comes the real flame of the album (if you'll pardon the pun lol) - Firestarter. By far The Prodigy's most well-known track, this was one of the standout tracks of the nineties and, love it or hate it, was practically impossible to ignore. Following track Climbatize is a lot calmer and softer than the audio assault preceding it, the album's only purely instrumental track. Final track Fuel My Fire is in my opinion another star of the album, and, like Firestarter, brings out the band's love of angry punk.  Fat Of The Land was the album that cemented The Prodigy's place in popular culture all over the world. While it alienated some of the band'solder fans and even lost them a few, it's undoubtedly a killer disc. 4.5 stars from me!  TaintedAngel :)
B00004XONN|5.0|If you've been wanting to try something different, you've come to the right place. Kid A is different. Really different. To give you an idea of what I mean, consider the fact that when I hear the album, I envision sitting in a canoe, slowly drifting through a warped Disney World ride. Not too many albums make me feel that way. The scenery changes every few minutes --sometimes strange, sometimes depressing, sometimes beautiful.   Idioteque thrills with a four-note volume swell placed over an assaulting dance beat, and it accomplishes a feat: a nihilistic song that's actually catchy. The title track has a slow and gentle feel, almost easing you to sleep until the snare drums abruptly cut into the song. Thom's voice has the consistency of play-doh, warping into different shapes through-out. (Also, be sure to check-out John Mayer's acoustic cover of the song. Amazing.) Motion Picture Soundtrack is a fitting song to close the album, with its gorgeous accompaniment of harp strings not to be missed.   The shining moment, if there can be such a thing in a landscape of such confusion, melancholy, and loneliness, is the fourth track --How to Disappear Completely. This song, like nearly all of the songs on the album, is best enjoyed when listened to in the late evening, perhaps on a long drive through winding roads in the countryside, guided by the moonlight. If you can't listen to it under those conditions, fear not: a quiet nighttime stroll can do that trick as well. The pain in Thom's voice is convincing, making you feel that he has stepped out of a crushing moment, like a ghost, to try to come to terms with the gravity of what has just happened. 5:24 on the track is the climax (you'll know it when you hear it), bringing the jarring cacophony of sounds just before to a resolve.   The phrase 'pushing the envelope' has turned into a cliche in music, but here is an album that actually does just that. Rolling Stone rated it the top album of the decade. Kid A truly is a magnificent work, but like all great works of art, it's genius won't hit you right away. Rather, it unfolds gradually as you visit it repeatedly, until at some point, you 'see' what the others meant. Whether you end up liking the album or not, it's something you won't forget anytime soon.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I grudging started reading the Hunger Games because I had heard so many of my facebook friends talking about it months ago. Once I downloaded the first book and started reading it, I immediately downloaded the next two. I couldn't put it down, I loved Katniss' strength and frailty. She was a very unlikely heroine. I felt so connected to her and the other characters that I was actually depressed when I finished the trilogy. I had to take a few days, almost in mourning (LOL) for my characters before I could start another book. It was THAT good.
B005IS565S|5.0|Ive got all 3 albums and each one is different but sticking to their original style. The songs are catchy but not repetitive, vocals are great and aggressive but can be very powerful at the same time, just like the other albums. Drums are awesome as always and the new bassist seems to have done a really good job too. I would recommend this to anyone that likes metal/hard rock or if you're into their old stuff, buy it now!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Great books, loved them. The formatting is horrible though and on the kindle for iOS it sucks even more. I have Kindle on my iPad, iPhone and Mac. Why they couldn't just give you 4 INDIVIDUAL books in the bundle I have no idea. In far they are bundled together as one GIANT book that has four books within it. When you are finished with one you start up the next one right away. God help you if by accident you lose your place because you'll be searching forever to try and find that page again.<br />The other thing is that the kindle app for the iDevices doesn't make it any better. Because of this stupid formatting, the furthest read page according to the app is 57000 whereas I'm actually reading 15000. So when I pick up my iPad and try and start reading where I left off on my iPhone, it tries to take me to page 57000 instead of page 15010 for example.<br />No issues with the author though, love the books.
0316017930|2.0|I do love Malcolm Gladwell. I remember meeting him in 2008 and smile a bit too wide when I had my picture taken with him. I loved Tipping Point - I loved Blink. I read every word and I did reviews on my blog (over at Prolific Living) and I talk him up big time.<br /><br />With Outliers, it took me years to crack it open - it was a gift from an old boss and I gave it a good few hours. I LOVED the concept of the 10,000 hour practice to \\"perfection\\" or to that sweet expert status. I look at my blogging and writing game and how much time I have vested in the last 2 years to make this drastic change from a corporate life into a serial blogger, writer, entrepreneur life and if I were to count the hours, I bet it would be somewhere in the 7000-8000 range .... a work in progress on doubt but the theory is an attractive one, especially for those of us with less than the ridiculous IQ that he uses in his examples.<br /><br />But the case studies get more tedious, and more wordy, and less captivating as the book goes on. I read probably the first half and skimmed the last and seriously don't think I will ever go back. I think he could have done this in a shorter book. Plus the airplane crash chapter made me shudder. Thanks a lot. I fly a lot, ya know? ;)<br /><br />Sigh. So I would say go read his other books and just skim summary of the Outliers to know that you do not need to be a genius to become that outlier in this world. You just need a lot of time and a lot of practice.
B00005JCAA|5.0|Meet Joe Black was one of the most under-appreciated and under-rated films of the last decade.  While some critics complained about the film's three-hour running time, they sadly missed the point.  Director Martin Brest was not afraid to take his time in telling the quirky story of bringing death to life.  Yes, it is a remake that has been done before, (Death Takes a Holiday) and all versions have their own charm, but this one stands far and above the others.  Brad Pitt has the difficult task of trying to be mysterious, coy, threatening, menacing, charming and even funny.  He pulls all of these character traits off in ways a lesser actor might over-play or miss completely.  Newcomer, Claire Forlanie holds her own against Pitt, matching his sexual energy with grace and charm, never over-playing her sexiness.  In other words, she's hot, but doesn't play at it.  And of course, how could you go wrong with Anthony Hopkins?  His screen presence is so dominant, yet oddly subtle at the same time.  Watching his heart attack scene is a study in acting all by itself.  He is actually talking to himself, while listening to himself and writhing in pain at the same time.  Filming that scene was a nightmare unto itself, but is brilliantly done on all levels.  The supporting cast is also top notch, with Jeffrey Tambour, Jake Webber and Marsha-Gay Hardin holding up the back-story perfectly.  If you enjoy beautifully done movies that take you away to a different place and make you think about life and love, then settle in, preferably with a special friend, (No, it is NOT a chick flick!) and fall in love with movies again.  Give, Meet Joe Black, a chance.
0316098329|5.0|I've never read anything like this book. At first, when I saw it was written in the first person perspective of a 5 year old boy, I was a little skeptical and thought four sure I would read a couple chapters and be bored. Boy was I wrong. This book is absolutely incredible. It is sad and horrifying and exciting and happy and keeps you turning the pages. I read this book in two days. I just couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I realized I stayed up all night and it was around 5am when I read the last words. It is such a powerfully moving story. You find yourself really feeling for this boy and his mother. I will recommend this book to all my friends.

0790749815|5.0|Hitchock's ultimate Hitchcock film. Too often is the English director Alfred Hitchcock compared to French director Henri Clouzot. This one will remind you that they lived in very different worlds. \\"North by Northwest\\" might be the wildest, biggest, and most American film Hitchcock ever did. Carey Grant's undeniable snark and charm elevate the story and heighten the suspense. James Mason's oiliness is perfect and Eva Marie Saint is lovely and strong as the woman you're never sure you can trust. Then there's young Martin Landau's piercing blue eyes. In many ways \\"North by Northwest\\" is more of a James Bond action flick than a classic Hitchcock mystery/suspense. And it might be better at being a Bond film than most Bond films. The DVD restores the picture and all that, but it also includes some very nice documentaries and making-of features (and Eva Marie Saint hosts). It's an economical single disc that measures up without busting your wallet.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I'm no seasoned  book reviewer but I truly enjoyed reading this book. Not that it was happy-go-lucky reading, it kept me tense and anxious for the safety of the brave, wonderful characters all the way through and didn't end with my desired ending. All that made it even more good reading. I felt the pain of the characters. Nuff said in case you wish to read this review and the book.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|It's all here. Bela Lugosi in his most famous role along with the Mexican version and a host of stellar documentaries, commentaries, and interviews all in a very handsome package. My one beef is the Philip Glass score (which is mercifully optional). I like Philip Glass (his work in Godfrey Reggio's \\"Qatsi\\" trilogy and elsewhere is impeccable), but his repetitive and overbearing forcefulness clashes too angrily with the picture. It's too bombastic and powerful for \\"Dracula\\" and warps the movie into a sort of shameful parody of itself. Stick with the ominous music-less track as it was originally made. It'll be quieter, but at least you'll be able appreciate the subtleties and beauty of this vintage horror classic.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Once again another albeit hard-hitting, still shallow sounding album. For those looking for that epic metallica sound that got them noticed, forget this crap. Their music is definitely turning in to sausage grinding material. Vocals are awful. Guitars are so-so. They just refuse to listen to their fan base. They are definitely an ego centric band. Vegas here they come.

B005KCZRI8|5.0|I plan on updating this review as I get a few more listens in but I want to put up this rough draft while its fresh in my mind.<br /><br />Fans of Late Night with Jimmy Falon see The Roots perform every night and it's amazing to watch them play music from any genre. I think Girls is a band capable of that too. The core of this album is definitely Indie Rock but the outer edges are from all different genres. Honey Bunny is surfer rock. Alex has a 90's pop trio feel like Everclear (not vocally but musically). Die sounds to me like 100,000 Years by Kiss. You can sing those lyrics right along with the first minute or so. Love Like A River is straight outta Motown. And the bonus track, Martha Martinez is an instrumental in the vein on Jessica by The Almond Brothers.<br /><br />To be continued...<br /><br />UPDATE (7/27/2012): OK so now I've had this album for a while and I have to say it's one of my favorites. I don't listen to the CD from beginning to end much anymore because I like listening to all my music on shuffle. But when a song from this album comes up it always has a nice familiar feel and I'm glad it's in the rotation,  no matter which song it is. I think that speaks to the variety of this album. Every song is unique and recognizable on its own and any one of them could be a radio hit. What a great, strong piece of art this is.<br /><br />I was saddened to learn that Christopher Owens left the band. And let's face it, he WAS the band. So I don't expect another Girls record any time soon (you never know they might bet back together though). Does it matter? No. This album is good and it will always be good no matter if the band is together or not.
0399250395|5.0|I got this as a present for my god daughter who is 6 months old. She's not quite ready to enjoy it yet, but both I and the child's parents were very impressed with the intricate pop-ups, the colors, and the overall execution. The little caterpillar crawling along the branch is awesome and (spoiler alert!) the butterfly on the last page is stunning. It's going to be a big hit!
B0057MFA42|4.0|The full screen with PCM audio version of the Blu-Ray is terribly out of sync. Watch the widescreen version with the DTS-HD audio track and you bypass the sync problem. Both versions are available on the blu-ray. Inexcusable error in production but at least there is a way of salvaging your purchase by using the right settings.
1423140591|5.0|Rick Riordan does it again with \\"The Son of Neptune\\". I couldn't put it down. The introduction of the Roman Camp into the series makes it even more exciting. I'm curious how the series will play out but don't want it to end. He could always write another Percy series, riight? :P
B002NV9AH8|4.0|I love Kim Bacon's singing on this, and Chester's grooves, which complement Tony's excellent songs. I mainly got this to listen to Undertow, but there are many great songs on here.  There's more of a pop feel than I remembered from when I first heard this back in the late '70's.  Thanks, Mr. Banks!

B0056BU3I2|5.0|Movie - 4.5  So I hadn't seen a single Fast & Furious movie prior to this. But I was browsing through Best Buy for my copies of other titles that came out that day when I saw the BB exclusive SteelBook edition. So for the first time in a while, I made a blind-buy based solely on the aforementioned packaging and the fact that The Rock was in it. I expected the preconceived notion that the other films had established (fast cars and hot girls), but was very surprised at how great of an action-heist-thriller this turned out to be. The story starts with Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) being sentenced to prison (I'm guessing from F4), and then breaking out. Meanwhile, former federal agent turned fugitive, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), and Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) are on the run in Rio de Janeiro. They agree to take a job to steal some federally-impounded cars belonging to Brazilian crime boss Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). During the robbery a couple of DEA agents are killed, in which the U.S. government then sends DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to apprehend Dom and O'Connor. Like I said, I've not seen a single film in the series, so whatever character-building there was I don't know about it. I just thought it would be interesting for once to take a movie this far into the lineup, watch it, and see if I'd like it (which I really did). Oddly enough, there wasn't as much street racing as I thought there'd be considering that's what I heard to be the draw. The action in this particular entry, however, is pretty exhilarating. I've been wanting to see The Rock in another action flick since The Rundown and Faster, and it's good to see him back doing what he does best (can't wait to see him in G.I. Joe either). And from what little I'd seen of Vin Diesel, I thought he was a pretty good action guy himself. But to see both he and The Rock duking it out (quite viciously, too) was very cool to watch. On top of that, the last half hour with the vault heist and all thestunt work they had to coordinate is among the best I've seen from a production standpoint. If you haven't seen any of the Fast & Furious yet, I can wholeheartedly recommend you at least start here.  Video - 5.0  - Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC  - Video resolution: 1080p  - Aspect ratio: 2.35:1  - Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1  Fast Five is another one of those movies that was filmed on 35mm then digitally processed, and it looks perfect on this transfer. I was convinced after just the first few minutes when they were stealing the cars from the train that the image would be a stunner. Contrast displays itself best during this sequence showing a lot of fine detail throughout the interior shots of the train when O'Connor and Mia are walking through the passenger car, down to the car car (it sounds weird saying that), and to the point when they cut the walls out to take the cars. In particular, the details I'm talking about are the shadow delineation amongst the lighting, the fact that you can see many of the grains of sand blowing through the air, and even some of the hairs on O'Connor's arms when he jumps out and hangs on the escape truck. Furthermore, when things get darker (from a lighting perspective) the detail remains just as immaculate. For me, it was the articulation of Hobbs' sweat running down his head and all the way to his beard. You can see each individual bead even when its dark outside. Colors are also handled extremely well, most notably in the scene with the car congregation where all the flashy cars, lights, and colorfully scantily-clad women make for some great eye candy. There are no instances of any tinkering whatsoever and the picture is as clean as can be. From a cinematographic view, I was very impressed with a lot of the footage they were able to get or integrate using as little CG as possible. A lot of the overhead shots of Brazil and the favelas add a nice exoticism to the feel of the movie itself, and I hope DP Stephen F. Windon gets more work inthe future. My favorite scenes for reference are the chase in the favelas for its overall balance in detail amongst all the chaos, the police Charger street race in the middle for some great black levels, the aforementioned car congregation for all the colorfulness it exudes, and of course the scene where Gisele is getting Reyes' hand print because it's detailed, colorful, and I'm a guy and thinks she looks really hot in a bikini.  Audio - 5.0  Languages  - English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1  - French: DTS 5.1  - Spanish: DTS 5.1  Subtitles  - English SDH, French, Spanish  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 track here is every bit as captivating as the video. Oddly enough, Jon Taylor, the re-recording mixer, has worked on mostly romantic comedies or dramas in his career. He has a few horror and action titles under his belt, but considering how aggressive the sound is for Fast Five, I'm surprised his talents have been so underused. With that being said, though, whether you're a fan of the series or a complete newbie like me, the audio alone makes up a good third of the enjoyment. As I've noticed with a lot of other car-involving sound designs (particularly The Transporter series), a really good car can make for some cool sound effects. The first one you really get to hear is Dom's 1970 Charger. And holy crap, is that thing loud. Its first appearance comes in from the rear left and not only packed a floor-shaking rumble, but even managed to rattle the driver in my dinky old Yamaha tower speaker. And then you have the revving of the engines of the cars they steal off the train, and even the train itself, making for lots of noise. Dynamic range is especially proficient with a lot of the vehicles because of the various engine types, car builds, and the way in which they're used (some for racing, some for ramming, and others for towing). In addition, there's also a lot more gunfire than I expected for the supposedly racing-oriented film I thought I was going to get. When the chasing and shooting ensue, directionality and separation are outstanding. Much like the various number of vehicles shown in the movie, there are also various weapons as well. Something like 150 different guns were made for the film, and while I couldn't keep track of all the calibers and makes, I'll take their word for it based on what I heard. LFEs are a given if you haven't associated everything else about the sound design with bass already, which should also be apparent if you're familiar with the work of composer Brian Tyler (who puts a lot of bass into his music). My favorite scenes are the favela chase, the shootout with Hobbs' team, and that crazy vault heist sequence at the end that destroys and damages things all over the place.  Extras - 4.5  - Audio Commentary (Director Justin Lin)  With this being both the first F&F and Justin Lin-directed film I've seen, I was very surprised at how informational it was. Lin has a very candid tone and talks about a lot of the filming, the production, the themes he wanted to portray with the characters, the evolution of the franchise from the first to the fifth, and what it was like working with everyone involved. And for a director I'd never heard of prior to this, I have to say he sounds like he has a pretty good grip on things.  - Deleted Scenes (HD; 1:40)  - Gag Reel (HD; 4:17)  - The Big Train Heist (HD; 7:37)  Deconstructing the production and stunt work of said heist. Particularly how they wanted to use as little CG and visual effects as possible and to outdo action sequences from the previous films. I think they succeeded.  - Reuniting the Team (HD; 4:59)  The casting of the characters and actors from previous F&F films. Again, not having seen any of the previous incarnations I have no idea who's supposed to be who and what kind of emotional baggage they're carrying. But I'm glad they got Gal Gadot!  - A New Set of Wheels (HD; 10:09)  Talking about all the cars they used here in F5 and how they sort of represent some of the characters. It's a pretty interesting take on car-to-character symbolism, especially in the case of the main characters.  - Dom's Journey (HD; 4:55)  A look at the motivations and evolution of Vin Diesel's character. I never took Diesel seriously as anything more than just another action body playing the tough guy, but this feature actually sheds a good deal of light on the character of Dom Toretto.  - Brian O'Connor From Fed to Con (HD; 5:55)  A look at Paul Walker's character across the series. Weird to see how much of a West Coast, middle class ricer he seemed to be in F2 with the blond hair and super Caucasian attire. Hard to think he progressed so much up to this point.  - Enter Federal Agent Hobbs (HD; 5:50)  A look at The Rock's character. I love the fact that they even have him in this film. The guy is charismatic and brings a lot to the table with his natural ability to look, act, and be tough in any kind of action role he gets, yet appears so humble off screen.  - Dom vs. Hobbs (HD; 7:31)  A breakdown of the big fight and the challenges faced in filming it. Both Diesel and Johnson talk about how they really respect each other and have wanted to work together for a while. Well, they got their chance, and boy did they give a good show.  - On Set with Director Justin Lin (HD; 8:36)  A look at filming the Porsche test-drive scene. He seemed a little annoyed at the fact that the stunt coordinators and driver weren't giving him what he wanted. They did quite a few takes and had a lot of talk in-between. Thankfully, they got what they needed to.  - Inside the Vault Chase (HD; 9:20)  A great look at how they put the logistics and production together for this thrilling sequence. This is one of the coolest action/heist sequences I've seen in a while. Some of it is visual effects, but a lot of it actually isn't. If you're interested in film-making in general, definitely check this one out.  - Tyrese TV (HD; 6:35)  The actor goofing around on set. He talks to the camera, goes around and talks to Justin Lin and Ludacris, and then hypes himself up like only he can. If you like his personality and sense of humor, this is worth a look.  - U-Control  A P-i-P commentary featuring 17 segments of behind-the-scenes footage NOT seen in the other features averaging about 3 minutes per segment totaling to another 50-ish minutes of total bonus features. There's also an option to turn on Scene Explorer during U-Control to show 3 versions of the train heist in PreVis, Dailies, and B-t-S all at the same time or just one a time (in which the single view will take up the entire screen). The U-Control feature is a little more cumbersome to sit through and navigate than Warners' Maximum Movie Mode or Lionsgate's Bonus View, but is still pretty informational.  Overall - 5.0  I've heard the F&F franchise is something of a mixed bag. Some people say it's good entertainment and others say it's a waste of time. Not having seen any of the previous films, I can't tell you what I think yet. But based solely on F5 alone, I have to say I'm pretty damn interested in seeing them now. F5, in particular, is a great heist flick with lots of action and style that ironically and apparently also has some of the long-rumored elements of The Brazilian Job (as in, the sequel to The Italian Job) in it. For whatever reason The Brazilian Job never made it out of production hell, nobody knows. But if the F5 crew did manage to sneak it in here, all the better. The video and audio are easily reference quality and the extras amount to well over 2 hours plus a great commentary. So if you're a fan of the franchise (I guess) or at least a fan of this installment, don't hesitate to pick it up and enjoy the ride.

B004P2HMNM|5.0|My 10 year old daughter loves this set!  She has the grand emporium (which is also amazing) and has completed several of the architecture sets.  The detail is very impressive, with cool interior spaces.  We love how the modular sets look when hooked together!!
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Mumford and Sons is a little indie rock, a little folk, a little blue grass...but at the end of the day they're just straight up good music.  Good for your ears, good for your soul.  Lots of raw emotion in these songs--you can tell these guys care about the music they're making.  Little Lion Man is probably the best song on the album, but the whole album overall is solid.  I would recommend this album to any of my friends, no matter what kind of music they normally listen to.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This works well.  My only complaint is that if you mistype the spacebar or punctuation it often chooses the wrong word.  This is a problem of the screen being small.  I have since gotten a tablet and that problem is resolved.
B002ZG981E|5.0|WATCH IT TWICE AT LEAST. The first time was amazing but I missed a lot of important things. Second time made much more sense. I love this movie. It's so haunting. And complicated.

B005ELQVGW|1.0|Let's get real- I love Bjork because she IS different but this cd is just lame.  Thank goodness I borrowed it.  I am not going to buy it.  I like experimental stuff but not for the sake of being \\"experimental\\"- we're still making \\"music\\" here that people want to listen to!  I would say this is one of the most un-listenable Bjork cd's for me (and I thought Volta was fine- not Medulla though).
B000EHQTZO|5.0|If there was ever a perfect monster/horror movie, it's this 1933 classic of classics. This is an old movie that still packs a punch today, which says something. It's also very impressive that the picture and sound quality are very respectable all these years later. As for the story, it moves along well, and Kong's delayed emergence creates anticipation, or perhaps fear in the viewer. This approach works very well, and once we see Kong, he's every bit as frightening and invincible as we imagined. There are several memorable scenes (fight with T-Rex, train, Empire State Building) that define what horror/monster movies would become later on. Of course, the movie wouldn't work without superb acting, most notably from Fay Wray, who gives the performance of a lifetime.

B0050CJNJ2|3.0|This CD didn't have many songs that really made the CD worth buying in general.  I was more than a little dissapointed to find that only a few of the songs had the same type of sound. The variety in country styles on this CD did not really add to it's appeal in my opinion.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|He leido los reviews que han dejado y veo que muchos son negativos, pero afortunadamente puedo decir que a mi me ha ido muy bien, el producto funciona perfecto, no he tenido ningún inconveniente de configuración desde el primer momento que lo prendí, siempre me ha detectado, eso si es importante afinar hacia arriba/abajo el foco del Kinect para que te ubique en el centro, pero esto es muy sencillo en la parte de configuracion de la zona Kinect. Para su correcto funcionamiento es muy importante que los lentes queden bien acomodados porque de lo contrario puedes tener problemas de deteccion. Para protegert tu Kinect y evitar rayones coloquen como primer paso el protector plastico que viene con el producto ya que el Zoom al moverlo sobre el kinect de lado a lado para acomodarlo lo raya.  Funciona muy bien con todos mis juegos Kinect Adventures, Kinect Sports, Dance Central y Your Shape Fitness Envolved.   Finalmente recomiendo el producto 100% satisfecho y feliz porque ahora puedo jugar sin pensar en los limites de espacio.   Sugerencia: Lei que para que el kinect te pueda detectar mejor, al inicio de la calibracion del juego te ubiques lo mas lejos posible y ya despues te acerques como quieras.
0345444051|5.0|I read this when I was a junior hippie and now wish more people would read it--all those people who think world peace and love would solve everything.  Man's brain was made for problem solving so we need conflict to ignite our imagination, our creativity.  That's what this book is about.  All the societies that used to be great but placed a dictator in place who forbid free thinking, who banned opposing his ideas, who sought for completely homogenous thought in everyone, all those societies produced nothing useful even though at one time, when there was more freedom to be different, they invented, they discovered, they challenged each other with ideas.  We need to keep this in mind and in practice or we are doomed.
0446585025|5.0|I love this book.  It is a very easy and funny read.  I don't know how she can write just like she speaks--but if you have ever heard her talk---she uses the same patterns in written form.  Some of the stuff is old material for me as I watch her all the time.  But it is still laugh out loud funny!!!!  It is great for brightening up my mood since I'm dealing with some pretty heavy stuff.  And I can just read a few pages at a time and get a good belly laugh.  It is such fast reading that i think it is easily read in 1-2 days.  Highly recommend!!  Keep one on hand and within reach if you are dealing with stressful things or idiots!!

B004KO8036|5.0|2011's Murder The Mountains is the second full-length album from Red Fang. It is somewhat of a grower and may take a few listens to fully get into, as while the music is all very strong and interesting, it doesn't jump out at you as immediately as tracks from their previous album like `Prehistoric Dog,' did, for example, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded for your patience.<br /><br />While reading a list of other bands in relation to one band can often be annoying; Red Fang are often described as being suitable for fans of bands like Mastodon, Baroness, Clutch, Melvins, The Sword, Fu Manchu and Queens Of The Stone Age and this does a good job not only of describing which end of the musical spectrum they sit on, but also the fact that the band flit psychotically between styles. Red Fang are compared to all the aforementioned artists seriously and not just because of touring partnerships or basic genre comparisons.<br /><br />For example, the opening track `Malverde,' is tom-based with complex instrumentation and sludgey vocals reminiscent of Baroness and Early Mastodon but the very next track `Wires,' is a bouncy, simplistic good time rock and roll number with clean and melodic vocals reminiscent of QOTSA, at least until the atmospheric proggy build up in the middle, at which point things change once more into a grand and spacey direction reminiscent of modern Mastodon.<br /><br />In the space between two songs, or even half a song Red Fang completely shift direction and cover all sorts of ground along the Stoner/Sludge/Progressive-Sludge areas of the genre, while still maintaining an original identity. Their sound can be dark, dense and brooding but it can also be bright, happy and bouncy.<br /><br />Album highlights include the speedy and impressive `Painted Parade,' the melodic Stoner-Rock track `Number Thirteen,' as well as `Dirt Wizard' and the aforementioned `Wires.'<br /><br />Overall; Murder The Mountains is a good record from Red Fang, while not exactly being a whirlwind of originality, they are musically competent and deliver this sort of music very well. Though it has been much said before, if you enjoy the sort of music that the aforementioned bands make, then you should give Red Fang a try; they use the same sorts of scales, play the same sorts of notes and arrange music in the same sorts of ways that those bands do.musically competent and deliver this sort of music very well.

0446547654|3.0|I have loved all of Nicholas Sparks books but I have to say this one is my least favorite. It felt depressing throughout the book. I was extremely disappointed in the ending of the book. I know that life happens but the end made me want to throw the book. I do have to say the book was written well as I was pulled in from the beginning. I just wasn't happy with the way the story unfolded. It also could be do to how emotionally attached I became to the main characters. Over all not a bad book but not my favorite of his.

076790592X|5.0|An excellent insight on what should truly matter to people; friends, family, a good conversation, waking up in the morning and get out of bed by your own means, etc.  The simply narration helps farther transmit Morrie's philosophy of what is important and what we actually will take to our graves; which are those every day simple moments that we take for granted and most of the time we disregard them or put them aside for more \\"important\\" superficial things.  It is a best seller, because it deserves it. Moving and captivating, after reading the book you'll wish to have a professor like Morrie.
B005869U6G|5.0|These guys aren't 25 anymore, and it shows in this beautifully mature album. I'm a long-time fan and have enjoyed growing up with them. They never disappoint.  Boyd's voice comes through so powerfully in the title track, it's knock-you-on-your-butt stunning. Einziger's time in Harvard, studying music, paid off in big ways.  Kudos to them, for having the guts to do what other bands don't: Grow up. Move on. Make music on their own terms instead of what the industry dictates will net money. When the music stays real to the artist it's that much more enjoyable for true fans.

0385737955|5.0|This book kept me eagerly reading until the early hours of the morning as I raced to the end.  The story is compelling and keeps you addicted from the very beginning.  It starts off when a 16 year old, Thomas wakes up to find himself in a metal box with a bunch of teen boys, some older, some younger, staring at him. Thomas eventually learns that he has arrived in a place called the Glade and is part of of  a self-contained group of boys who call themselves the Gladers.  He soon realizes that he has suffered from a memory loss that has caused him to forget names of people, his age and other personal information like that. But even with these downfalls Thomas is able to start his new life when a mysterious girl arrives  and changes everything. Now after finishing the book I eagerly await my next trip to the bookstore to buy the second book.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|love this game! just like final fantasy. some odd english translations for dialect but kinda makes it even more fun. No &quot;callers&quot; but a lot of customizations for weapons and other battle statuses. Yet gameplay is simple enough to keep attention. Can't remember if I paid anything for it but well worth if i did, and they should be charging if i didn't!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Yes. Who cares if Greedo shot first.  I'm perfectly OK with Han Solo being castrated.  I like midiclorions too.  Ef all that spiritual stuff...the force is due to bugs.  Next time have someone who is not snarky and actually knowledgeable write your \\"editorial review\\". Lucas cares about catering to the next generation because he is greedy, period.  Thank the gods Spielberg directed Indiana Jones or Lucas would render it completely devoid of it's charm as well.

Lena and Ethan's relationship gets more heartbreaking at each turn of the page. Link and Ridley even get closer. The family pulled together and I enjoyed seeing the closeness of everyone. There were so many twists and unexpected turns; I loved the end, I never saw it coming. I can not wait to read #3!!!<br /><br />I know my review is so short but I don't want to give it away...the best way to put it in words is, ITS A MUST READ!!!!!!
B000AP04OM|3.0|My goodness, 20th Century Fox will stop at nothing to re-release a DVD.  For the beloved classic The Sound Of Music, Fox has thrown in a bonus disc chock full of reminiscences from cast and crew to milk it for all that it is worth. It's not just a few minutes but contains lots of in-depth explanations of how they made the film, the difficulties on the location shootings and the real life Maria makes an appearance. It's also a breath of fresh air to see the child actors - some of whom have become grandparents. Behind the scenes, the actor playing the eldest boy said that Julie Andrews never lost her temper or got irritated over delays or made a mistake despite carrying the weight of the film on her shoulders. Well, I'm sure Julie's an angel despite in my own capacity having heard of bosses getting irritated, losing their cool or behaving unprofessionally.  The Sound Of Music was made with the intention to touch people and it shows in the original film. Unlike some productions which aim to harass people. Haven't those involved heard of retribution or bad karma?
B000O78KW4|4.0|DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE  1995 / 131 min. / Rated R  The summer of 1995 was certainly an interesting one. It was a summer that truly offered everything from original films to sequels to every genre and subgenre. There were all forms of adaptations from novels to comic books to even video games. It was a summer movie season that had something from everybody. It had action, comedy, drama, and it even ranked high with indie titles like the terrific `Usual Suspects,' \\"Smoke\\" and the controversial film \\"Kids\\". It was a summer that would ultimately see the biggest shocker; 4 of the 5 Best Picture nominees were released during those summer months (\\"Braveheart,\\" \\"Apollo 13,\\" \\"Babe,\\" and \\"Il Postino\\"). Amongst it all, however, the biggest worldwide film of that year was the third outing of the \\"Die Hard\\" franchise. Yippie-ki-yay indeed.  I make no bones about it; Die Hard with a Vengeance is my favorite Die Hard sequel. It's that good. The plot of this one centers on a man calling himself \\"Simon\\" (Jeremy Irons) who begins a reign of terror in the streets of New York City by blowing up a Department store. He then threatens to detonate bombs across the city unless Detective John McClane cooperates in a wicked game of \\"Simon Says\\". McClane, this time around, is a broken man. His marriage is on the rocks, he's been suspended from the force and he has one very bad hangover. With the reluctant assistance of a Harlem electrician, Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), the two try to race against the clock and catch their man.  There is so much to love about this one. You have the return of director John McTiernan, you got a sharp script from Jonathan Hensleigh, and great chemistry between Willis and Jackson. Not to mention, you also have a great villain (portrayed effectively by Jeremy Irons), you get plenty of laughs, surprises and of course, no Die Hard film is complete without some terrific action set pieces along the way. In the wake of Die Hard 2 and the many films that emulated the Die Hard formula - sometimes effectively well - it's a true accomplishment that this turned out as good as it did. McTiernan - as he did with the original film - keeps an impeccable pacing that balances everything from exposition to car chases to everything in between. The one complaint that you could toss its way perhaps is that the film's ending may be a bit anti-climactic but really, who cares? It's one of a hell ride.

B001VLBDD0|4.0|TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY  1991 / 137 min. / Rated R.  Synopsis: The cyborg who once tried to kill Sarah Connor must now protect her son, John Connor (Edward Furlong), from an even more powerful and advanced cyborg.  After The Terminator earned nearly $80 million at the worldwide box office, and did killer business on home video, a $102 million-budgeted sequel by writer-director James Cameron was unleashed less than 7 years later. For me, T2 was my first exposure to the Terminator franchise. I was dragged along to see it opening night with my sister and brother-in-law. The spectacle of the film certainly blew me away at the time. After seeing the movie, I obviously went and rented the first, and since then, I had eagerly awaited a third film - but let me not get too far ahead of myself here.   By the time Terminator 2 rolled around, Arnold was already a big star. He was coming off such hit films like Predator, Kindergarten Cop, and Total Recall, so in hindsight it's not too surprising that his return would amount to him being transformed into the good guy but that he'd also receive much more dialogue. Beyond that, Arnold's new look of black leather and sunglasses are just classic. As it should be, he is the highlight of the movie. The bad Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), is visually impressive (especially for its time), and the action is first rate, as is its CGI effects. The latter, handled by Industrial, Light & Magic, is perhaps the most famous and groundbreaking element from T2. We do, however, get more classic lines from Arnold - most notably, \\"Hasta La Vista, Baby\\" - and we get a better performance this time around out of Linda Hamilton.   The dark and gritty tone of the first film is replaced, however, with a much sleeker and polished blockbuster feel. It certainly has an overload of some snazzy death-defying action sequences, some witty humor and even by the conclusion, you get a little sentimentality thrown in for good measure.   Critically speaking, the biggest issues I have with the film is that it does get a bit too heavy handed, it has inconsistent pacing (it needed more tightening) and admittedly, Edward Furlong is a bit on the whiny side. Nonetheless, T2 starts off exceptionally well, loses its footing at the midway point and recovers for a satisfying conclusion. It's an entertaining enough follow-up and it's undoubtedly one of the most influential films of the past 20 years. The film did manage to achieve a worldwide gross of $519 million in 1991 which to put into perspective for you, only Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and E.T. had grossed more at that time. T2 would be nominated for 6 Oscars, winning for sound, make-up, visual and sound effects. Ultimately, the movie would cast such a large shadow that any follow-up would be closely scrutinized --- and it most certainly was....
0439023521|5.0|i dont like reading books but this was a book. i could not it  put down. it had action humor and romance. the book is about this girl who's father dies in a coal mining accident and illegaly hunts to stay alive in the county of panem in the ruins of north america. there are 12 districts in the country. every year as payback for a rebellion the capitol makes 2 tributes one boy one girl to go to an arena to battle to the death which is broad cast on live TV for every one to watch. the main character is not in luck when her younger sister is choosen to go into the games. she throws her little sister back and volunteers to go to the games for her. i thought the first 50 pages of the book were a little slow but after that it got really good. i would recommend this book to every one.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD  2007 / 130 min. / Rated PG-13  It took 12 long years until we would see John McClane on the big screen again and its pre-release news stories certainly had me squirming in my seat. Right off the bat, I wasn't happy about the film's title --- it seemed much more appropriate for a tagline. I was also mightily concerned that the guy who did the Underworld movies was going to be directing, as well. \\"They couldn't get anyone more established?\\" But oddly, I was even more concerned when I had first seen an unofficial pic from the set of a bald John McClane. \\"A Bald John McClane, WTF?\\" Then, if that wasn't bad enough, soon rumors started to spread that Fox was going to cut the film from its intended R rating to the more mainstream friendly PG-13. I couldn't believe that after such a long wait that this is what they were going to do to my favorite action franchise.  Live Free or Die Hard - the title has since grown on me - is Die Hard in the post-9/11 world and wisely, they only embrace that idea. A group of terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) are systematically shutting down the United States computer infrastructure. McClane - who is sent to pick up a suspected hacker, Matt Farrell (Justin Long) - gets entangled in the plot when gunmen are sent to kill Farrell. Soon McClane - who is \\"a Timex watch in a digital age\\" - is back to his old tricks again and nothing will stop him until he gets his man.  Director Len Wiseman really did a great job with this movie and I really give him loads of credit. He clearly understood the property and did his best to make it as entertaining as the previous installments while offering something new to the proceedings. The action scenes are truly spectacular - particularly, the tunnel sequence. There's some cool witty banter between Willis and Long, and a little heart tossed in by the inclusion of McClane's daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Mark Bomback's script was also sharp enough to include manyof the trademark Die Hard elements, and some cool little homage's to previous installments as well.  As for the much bandied about PG-13 rating; it really doesn't effect the enjoyment of the film at all for me. I have also seen the unrated version - which is essentially the intended R-rated cut - and I honestly prefer the theatrical version. The thing that makes the PG-13 work here is that it was filmed as an R movie, so you still have plenty of profanity and the action/violence is still quite visceral. Despite the odds, it still managed to be edgy. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this is the furthest a PG-13 rating has been pushed in the past 15-20 years. With all things considered, this really turned out much better than it had any right to be, and it was the most fun I had at the movies in 2007. Plus, like all the other Die Hard films, this one also has terrific replay value. It's over the top, yes but it's a whole lot of fun. And I want more. Bald or not, ratings be damned, bring on number 5.

B00005JM0B|4.0|TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES  2003 / 109 min. / Rated R  Synopsis: John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now in his 20's, and a female terminator, called T-X (Kristanna Loken), is after him. Another T-101 is sent back through time to protect John once again on the verge of the rise of the machines.  After 12 long years, I was sure to be the first in my seat for the third installment of the Terminator series. Personally, I liked the idea of mixing in a female Terminator, and I was happy to see that the series' storyline had actually progressed. This time around, however, James Cameron did not write nor direct this installment, and I would be willing to bet that's why there's so much hostility towards this entry (and I'm sure the dropping of Sarah Connor didn't help matters either).   This may not be a popular opinion, but director Jonathan Mostow (\\"Breakdown\\") with screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris delivered a high-octane action film that is infectiously entertaining. I think Mostow should be commended for retaining a Cameron feel to the proceedings and deserves kudos for the nods to the previous two films. I really liked how streamlined this outing is. There's no pretentiousness here, the film strictly aims to entertain. It's a true-blue summer movie. The effects are still top notch - in fact, it's visually the best of the three - and the ending is both gutsy and a complete knockout.   Many die hard fans, however, complained the film was just \\"more of the same\\". They felt it didn't deviate enough from T2. Interestingly, they seem to forget that the same could be said of T2 in relation to the first Terminator. Sequels generally follow their own formula, and this franchise - up to now - is no different. It all depends how you shape the existing concept and how far you're willing to stretch it. For me, Rise of the Machines took it much further than T2. That said, many fans were hoping for more exposition and explanations that - in honesty - really aren't all that necessary at this point and ultimately, it would only bog the movie down. It seems too many fans wanted more of a technical and dramatic interpretation of the story and were disappointed to get a full blown action film with some comedic gags instead. The latter seemed to rub some fans the wrong way. In a scene or two, I can understand how they could feel the humor went too far, but it really isn't too far removed from the comedic shenanigans of T2. The bottom line for me is that the movie is still loads of fun (and interesting) while staying true to the big-budget formula of its predecessor. Sure, there's some inconsistencies, mainly with John Connor's character (he says he was 13 at the time of T2, but yet he was actually supposed to be 10), and he still hasn't fully understood what's going on (I mean, he should know that these terminators are mass-produced, right?). But these issues aside, Nick Stahl did a nice job with the role. I was - and still am - quite happy with this film that elicited both nostalgia and something new to boot. For my money, the series has so much going for it, what could go wrong? ...
B0055OK2T0|4.0|so, i went into this movie expecting to see a different version of the 'matrix', a more 'present day' version, which i would've been ok with.  now, even tho i'm a chick, i'm not big on 'chick flicks', and it always amazes me how men write the mooshiest chick flicks ever!!!  i liked the action/adventure part of the movie.  overall, not a bad flick.  a little too hokey romantic for my taste, maybe i'm too much of a realist, it was a cute movie all in all.  i think i enjoyed it most because it was a 99cent rental, not sure i would've enjoyed it as much had it cost me more.  chicks will dig it and most guys watching it with their chicks will live thru it thanks to the action scenes.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|Terminator Salvation  2009 / 115 min. / PG-13  Synopsis: John Conner (Christian Bale) is fated to lead humanity's war against the machines, but the arrival of a stranger, Marcus Wright, (Sam Worthington) alters the future of mankind.  It had been six years since we last saw an installment to the Terminator franchise. That film, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, was viewed as a \\"disappointment\\". Since then, a lot had changed. Most notably, Arnold Schwarzenegger walked away from acting to become the Governor of California. So leading into a fourth film, many were concerned if there was even life to the franchise after Arnold.   There was a lot at stake with Terminator Salvation, the fourth film in the popular franchise. The huge burden was inexplicably handed over to the Charlie's Angels director, McG. As to be expected, the internet was aghast with the announcement. \\"How could this guy be the one to carry on the franchise?\\" Soon after, fans seemed to cool down due to the signing of Christian Bale as John Connor. This casting decision, however, would cause serious havoc to the screenplay penned by Terminator 3 scribes John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris. Connor, who was originally conceived as a small, mystical figure was now required to be sprinkled throughout the entire film causing the characters of Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) to be diminished. Ultimately, this is where it all goes wrong for the film. The script had been raped and pillaged and devoid of what the fans would have expected with such a concept. All we get is wall-to-wall action with very little in between.  Christian Bale, who is often cited as being 'terrible' in this film, just simply has nothing really to work with and ultimately, the character of John Connor actually seems to be pretty pointless. The same could be said for Bryce Dallas Howard as his wife Kate. It often feels - as was the case - that these characters were shoehorned in with nothing for them to do. Sam Worthington,however, is really the only interesting thing about the movie. His character may not be great but at least he offers something. In fact, I would have loved to have seen more of the relationship between him and Reese be developed instead of the need for an explosion every two minutes. That is, however, the one good thing that could be said for the film. It certainly has some nice looking effects.   The real problem here, as stated earlier, is the script. There's nothing going on, and when there is, it becomes flat out illogical or it contradicts elements of the previous Terminator movies. They do try to appease the die-hards by infusing some nostalgia by incorporating Linda Hamilton's voice, the CGI-Schwarzenegger and throwing in a sampling of the series' classic theme, but despite it all, it never truly feels like a Terminator movie. Many may pin that on its PG-13 rating, but in honesty, an R-rating wouldn't have saved this one. And don't even get me started on the film's ending. Who the hell thought that was a good idea?!  Overall, Terminator Salvation is essentially one loud, elongated action sequence that lingers on and on for nearly two hours. It's poorly paced and erratically edited with no substantive dialogue or situations. It's just a flimsy, unoriginal, forgettable film that would have been best left unmade.

B003Z0BWRM|4.0|Writing this is tricky, cos I've already started city of ashes, and my enthusiasm is waning by the page, but I have to try and remember what it was like the first time I read this.<br />I'd heard such a lot about this book, my expectations were sky high. And at first I absolutely loved it, I thought it was inventive and imaginitive. The characters were cool, the marks were a nice idea, its funkily Gothic. It was only towards th end that the links to other stories stacked up so high that I started to really notice them. The Luke and Leia thing and the Sirius Black thing were the biggest.<br />Still. though, I liked it. The description of the demons was another high point.<br />The other down side to this story is that you can't afford to think about it too mcuh, or you come across plot holes, like for example, Valentine lived for ten years in a mansion house in whatever their secret country is called, and nobody noticed? not all thier smarts and everything, and nobody thought there was something funny going on? And he didn't bother with all his plans for world domination? He took time out from them for ten years? What am I missing here
B004WPYNY8|5.0|I am giving it 5 stars as I do love it, but I would give 4 1/2 if I could. I think the sound is VERY similar to Paradise Lost which I absolutely loved and feel is the better of the two albums and the origianl if you will. Michael talks of how he added industrial souunds to mix it up but I don't hear that as any great leap forward in sound. Still a great album, but Paradise Lost had me second guessing my fav band which is Dream Theater with Iconoclast I am not.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Didn't realize I had worn out my copy of Almost Famous so was pleased with the sound and clarity of the original version too. Loved the Director's cut...it does flesh out the characters...and I did use my ipod and played Stairway To Heaven...the boyfriend is the best in that scene! And the cd is fun so was totally worth it and I got it almost immediately-great source for used items. Only thing missing was the plastic wrapper, otherwise I would have thought it was new!
B005974CNA|5.0|For anyone who has been disappointed with the the last few albums I urge you to purchase this one and find the love again.
B004LWZW42|4.0|First Class is great for any X-Men fan or even comic fan in general. Gives some real insight into the characters and I love seeing some rare characters features. Characters like Darwin and Azazel are in this one. The only problem is that it doesn't quite fit in with the continuity of the other movies. But it you take this movie just by itself, it's an awesome movie.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I read the book and really enjoyed it. One thing about Sam Childers is he doesn't hide behind his religion. He shows his warts, he shows his failures, and he shows Gods love and grace in his life and the children he saves. He was in Sudan when the rest of the world either ignored the murders or was afraid to act.  I haven't seen the movie yet so honestly I can only attest to the book. It was great. I found it disturbing that the description by the Amazon staff reviewer appeared so pre-biased and racist against this man. I will be seeing this film along with my whole family when it comes out in a few weeks. If as good as the book it is likely I will be buying the DVD as well.   If only more Christian men had the convictions of Mr. Childers. I hope to be one of them.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Somehow I didn't expect much of this 2 cd set. Sometimes it is good not to expect too much because when you get it and it sinks into the consciousness via the ears one hears equal beauty, innovation, beautiful song writing...some times with a jazz touch. Trey Gunn, Jordan Rudess, Dave Stewart, Pat Mastelleto, Steve Hacket and others contributed beautiful to this absolute work of art. Don't doubt this one...just buy it!
B003X5UFWW|4.0|I enjoyed this very much. The voices used were terrible.  They sounded a little goofy, as was the movie in the beginning, but once the war started and Japan occupied, it was much better.
B004XQO8VO|4.0|Yes, the movie is, as of this writing, anachronistic.  Supposedly, the last MDK in Los Angeles was last year, et al.  But it is an enjoyable movie with recognizable actors.  And how cute as a button is/was Sandra Bullock!  I could watch this movie over and over again.<br /><br />Having seen this movie mostly on broadcast TV and on Amazon Instant Video, watching the Blu-ray version was like watching it for the first time.  So sharp and clear!  I was finally able to see the continuity error of Wesley Snipes eye color switch back and forth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not much in the way of extra features and no BD Live content.
B000E0LB7C|4.0|Were Wilhelm Backhaus (1884-1969) to come on the scene today, he would never be accepted seriously as a Beethoven player. His occasional added bass octaves, failure to play most repeats and idiosyncratic approach to markings (he seemed to have little patience for the slow movements in Beethoven) would doom him with the critics and maybe the public too. But, thank God he came from another era, because there are some really marvelous things in this set.  Backhaus was seventy-four when he returned to the studio in 1958 to begin recording this cycle of Beethoven sonatas, a multi-year project in stereo sound which was nearly complete before his death in 1969 (only the Hammerklavier remained to be done - the mono recording included here comes from 1952). Despite the pianist's age, the playing is consistently vigorous and there's no sign of technical decline - in fact, it's hard to believe Backhaus was in his eighties when nearly half of these sonatas were recorded. His Beethoven was direct, masculine and extroverted almost to an extreme; if one phrase could describe his playing it would be unrelenting forward momentum.  It was his often unorthodox approach that didn't go over well with some critics even forty years ago, not to mention today. Harris Goldsmith, in his overview of the sonatas in the Beethoven bicentennial year for &#34;High Fidelity&#34; magazine wrote of Backhaus that &#34;there is a burly weight and robust elementalism that infuses his playing, but it is the authoritative weight of German Romanticism rather than the more specific linearity of the true Beethoven style. There is something disappointingly cavalier about the late pianist's brisk treatment of slow movements and a failure to reach boiling emotional temperature in the more expressive moments. I also take exception to sundry anachronisms in Backhaus' pianism - his added bass octaves, for instance, and his old-fashioned left-hand anticipations. Another major Backhaus shortcoming...is his unwillingness to play really softly. The tone he produces is expansive and agreeable but there is little dynamic contrast (always an important ingredient in a Beethoven interpretation).&#34;  Similarly, in 1970 the Gramophone reviewer wrote of the LP issue of this cycle that &#34;almost every instrumental reviewer writing in these columns over the years...betray a remarkable unanimity of opinion that, too often, Backhaus himself is too loud. Also that on occasion he is magnificent. And that the contrast is dismaying: the following of a splendidly tempestuous allegro by an insensitively robust adagio has been a universal disappointment.... This is playing which can indeed vary from magnificent to wooden. A display of the highest technical control can be followed (especially, curiously, in the earlier sonatas) by muddles of fingering, of rhythm, of tempo, or of dynamics. The later sonatas are more reliable: but again there are strong contrasts between movements. The last sonata of all is very much a case in point: it is hardly possible to imagine a more overwhelming performance of the first movement, or a more disappointing one of the second.&#34;  Jed Distler, in a 2006 review of this Decca box set, echoed Goldsmith: &#34;In general, the pianist's cavalier attitude toward Beethoven's dynamics, articulation, and phrasing obscures the composer's clearly specified linear trajectory and implicit drama. Slow movements tend to be perfunctorily brisk and overly loud (the pianist rarely achieves a true pianissimo), and many repeats are omitted. I also suspect that the stylistic anachronisms characterizing Backhaus' pianism (de-synchronized hands, added bass octaves, arpeggiated chords) arise more out of habit than intent.... However, despite my cavils, you cannot deny Backhaus' sincerity, his ripe, well-modulated sonority, and the communicative immediacy he often achieves.&#34;  Jeremy Siepmann, in his excellent liner notes accompanying this set, observes that &#34;Time and again Backhaus neglects Beethoven's markings; sometimes, too, he can neglect the spirit - but there is no causative link between one and the other. Some of his sublimest (and most profoundly Beethovenian playing) coincides with his most licentious textual negligence, while some of his least persuasive is more scrupulously observant. To get the full measure of Backhaus's stature in Beethoven, one should lay aside the score, along with ones' preconceptions, and listen purely to the music.&#34; Which is exactly what I found myself doing.  Protracted listening accentuates some of the shortcomings of Backhaus's approach, but I found so much to appreciate that I ended up not caring too much about the details. Certainly some of the early sonatas could have used a defter touch; for example, what was Backhaus thinking rushing through op. 14 no. 1? But he pulls a rabbit out of a hat with a perfectly proportioned op. 14 no. 2 and follows that with a marvelous op. 22. The big op. 10, no. 3, is flat-sounding compared to Arrau, but the Tempest and Waldstein sonatas really benefit from the pianist's full-blooded extroversion. And what a contrast there is between the opening measures of his Pathetique vs. Brendel's morbid pace. The Funeral March movement of op. 26 lacks sufficient gravitas, but what else could be expected given Backhaus's typical congeniality? The Moonlight though gets a thumping good reading - what a great finale! And so on.  Overall then, this cycle is a fascinating journey, but not into the inner soul of Beethoven. Harris Goldsmith may have recommended that &#34;one or two of the Backhaus discs ought to be acquired as treasurable mementos from a grand old man who loved to play the piano; as Beethoven interpretations of the highest order, though, they should be viewed a bit skeptically&#34;; however, I think more than a few of the discs in this cycle are treasures.   Four stars.

0385344325|4.0|This is vintage Reacher, and the plot is solid, with lots of interesting characters thrown in, with old acquaintances making cameo appearances . Unfortunately the ending defies credibility. There are limits to what our hero can do, and I am not referring to his physical prowess. A jarring note is a reference to his brother Joe. Reacher is told that he is in the town of Margrave. Reacher faithful followers will remember that in \\"The killing floor\\" he did not know that his brother was supposed to be in the vicinity. Minor? Perhaps.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I, like several other people, have been disappointed by the armrest iPod adapter included with several VW models. I drive a 2009 Jetta and the iPod adapter, while functional, poses a number of problems:<br /><br />- It doesn't charge newer iPods and iPhones<br />- If you have a case on your device, it doesn't fit inside the narrow dock/armrest<br /><br />Enter the dockstubz. I initially bought the dockstubz to use with a newer iPod nano. Some pros and cons:<br />+ It charges as advertised<br />+ Includes a mini USB port for extra charging<br />+ Connection is pretty tight, so you don't have to worry about the iPod or iPhone becoming loose/falling out.<br />+ Audio quality does not appear to suffer (even with use of the dockXtender)<br />- The added height means that the armrest in the car doesn't close fully<br />- The female end that attaches to the VW adapter is looser than the male end, so when you reach down to pull out your iPod, the dockstubz often comes out with it.<br /><br />Many of these problems were solved by buying the dockXtender. I plugged the dockstubz into the VW adapter, and the dockXtender into the dockstubz. The dockXtender enabled me to keep my iPod (and iPhone) out of the armrest, as well as removing the need to keep fiddling with the dockstubz (since I can just attach the iPod/iPhone to the male end of the dockXtender, rather than the dockstubz).<br /><br />Of course the VW iPod adapter still doesn't show song information on the radio screen and the iPod/iPhone controls can't be used because the VW adapter locks the device. However, dockstubz + dockXtender has made iPod/iPhone use a lot more bearable! For $50, these two items are not a bad solution. Changing out the radio, adding an aux-in line, etc. are far more time consuming and costly! I'm very pleased with CableJive products.
1423140591|5.0|When I was reflecting on how much I enjoy Rick Riordan's books, I decided that the greatest thing about them is that they are enjoyable for so many different age groups. I could hand it to a 10 year old and there would be jokes that kids that age would find especially appealing, yet there is a complexity to Riordan's books which appeals to adults as well. The books don't talk down to kids, and with all the great characters, the action, and the mythological base to the story, the books are completely awesome for every age.<br /><br />It's hard to write a coherent review for this specific book, or even for the series, because I had such a good time reading it. I adored the Percy Jackson books and I think I like the Heroes of Olympus books just as much, if not more. I loved Jason, Piper, and Leo in the first book, and I loved Hazel and Frank in this one. And then there's the fact that Percy is a main character in this book, which was awesome. It was so fun to come back to that character and see things from his perspective again. Riordan has a real gift for making you fall in love with his characters and really care about their well being.<br /><br />Reading about Camp Jupiter and seeing the Roman side to things was quite interesting, and I can't wait to see what happens when the Greeks and Romans come together in the next book. There are so many great moments in 'The Son of Neptune', but I can't really mention too many of them without being spoiler-y. I will say this: keep an eye out for Ella the harpy, because she is just so sweet and also hilarious, as well as when the Amazons make an appearance using Amazon.com headquarters as a front (so, so funny and clever).<br /><br />Basically, if you have an appreciation for heartfelt characters, intricate mythological plots, as well as lots of laughs and action then I think you will love this book and this series.

B0044RUSZM|3.0|From an ergonomic standpoint, a laptop stand is a must-have when using a laptop on a desk. I'm just not a fan of *this* particular laptop stand.  Don't get me wrong--It's a perfectly functional product and a good value for the money. Although not pictured, there are little plastic snap-in stoppers to keep the laptop from sliding off the stand--not that this would actually happen. The soft material on the top of the stand is very grippy and kept my aluminum Macbook Pro in place perfectly. There is room underneath for small items such as portable hard drives or KVM boxes, which is nice for conserving desk space and something other stands don't have.  I just don't like this product from an aesthetic standpoint. The clear plastic end stoppers and bottom lip just kind of tacky and don't mesh with the otherwise aluminum look of the product (or the Macbook Pro the marketing material seems to indicate the stand should be used for). It just looks weird on my desk. Also, the aluminum ends that go into the bottom lip don't fit snugly enough, so there can be some wobble when putting on or removing the laptop, something really bothersome if you're of the OCD sort.  If you're on a budget, this is a fine stand to get. If you are vain and have money to burn, there are much nicer looking products on the market for more money.

I found that I knew quite a bit about the West but almost nothing about the East.  After reading this book I can understand better my colleagues from Asia :-  The author did a nice job discussing other more popular theories about Western dominance and showing where they fail.  As for drawbacks, this book is written by archaeologist hence there is a lot of archaeological details.  Sometimes I felt that I was reading a scientific article rather than a book for general audience.

Which are easier to get once you already have some. Wade, though smart and techno-savvy, is too poor to get ahead.<br /><br />But he has hope. James Halliday, genius designer of OASIS, an eccentric loner without family and with only one estranged friend, died some years earlier, leaving his billions to the person who can solve his final puzzle. Inside OASIS are three hidden keys, which will take the player through three portals and lead finally to the prize egg.<br /><br />Clues? Halliday, a child of the 1980s, remained fixated on his formative decade's video games and pop culture. All the clues are hidden therein. Wade, like everybody else, has become an expert on the '80s, but so far no one has succeeded in getting even a toehold in Halliday's final big game.<br /><br />Wade, of course, makes the breakthrough, the first step. But just barely a step ahead of the woman he loves from afar. And on his heels is the evil corporation IOI, which hopes to take over OASIS and turn it into a huge moneymaker, beginning with charging for access.<br /><br />Things get ugly in the real world as well as the virtual world as IOI determines to win at any and all costs and Wade needs to find a way to guard his human body and outwit the corporation -- and everyone else breathing down his neck -- while pursuing Halliday's ever more complicated puzzles.<br /><br />A fun read, even for those, like myself, who don't know much about video games or '80s culture. For all I know, half the '80s stuff could be fictional, not that it would matter.<br /><br />Cline keeps the level of suspense high and creates a dazzling, magical world in sharp contrast to the gray ugliness of reality. OASIS, with its teleportation, magical dangers and powers, and its exquisite, self-contained planets, is an enchanting place.<br /><br />Still Wade and his few friends remain aware that OASIS is not the real world. They don't even know each other's real-world identities or what they actually look like behind the attractive avatars they inhabit. This creates a certain insecurity that never quite goes away and a niggling fear that real life is passing them by.<br /><br />How Wade deals with the evil corporation, his own -- and others' -- ingenuity, competition, cooperation, romance, friendship and the problems of real life, make Cline's debut a cyber-quest for anyone who enjoys speculative fiction.<br /><br />--Portsmouth Heraldorporation -- and everyone else breathing down his neck -- while pursuing Halliday's ever more complicated puzzles.

B005F44X36|5.0|This price can look absurd for two bluray disks, but notice there is more on this box, there is also a 1/12 miniature from Senna Lotus.  Ok, even then the price looks a bit high, since you can buy Senna McLaren MP4/6 from Tamiya (a kit to build) from less than $200.  BUT, this Lotus is already finished metal miniature and you cant find it anywhere else, not in this scale.
0240815807|5.0|As a full time engineer with over ten years experience and a formal degree in audio, I can honestly say that this book is probably more valuable than any schooling that I've had! As an SOS reader for many years, I was already a follower of Mike's work. His book and supplemental material take it to another level of depth and detail. I even emailed Mike with specific questions to which he responded quickly and was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this book.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's horror classic has never looked better than on this spectacular Blu-ray release from Universal. It looks like it could have been made yesterday. I owned this originally on VHS tape and then DVD, and this version is leaps and bounds ahead of those previous home video releases in terms of quality. The black-and-white image on the Blu-ray is solid, and the 5.1 Dolby surround sound enhances greatly the musical score and sound effects. For purists, the original mono soundtrack is included.   You can't go wrong with \\"Psycho.\\" It was fun showing it to some of the younger ones in my family who knew nothing about it. Now, if Universal could get around to finally releasing Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\" on Blu-ray (it's been available for pre-order now for over a year), things would be great. Also looking forward to Blu-ray releases of \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Rear Window.\\" Come to think of it, I'm looking forward to Blu-ray releases of all Hitchcock's classics. Would love to get my hands on a 3D Blu-ray of \\"Dial M for Murder.\\" And some of the older ones like \\"Rebecca,\\" \\"Lifeboat,\\" and \\"Notorious\\" would be nice, too.
015204907X|5.0|This book is adorable and easy for children to follow, and the illustrations make it hilarious for parents to read, too. I bought the board book to read to my 8-month-old and it's one of our favorites. The short, rhyming text keeps her engaged and entertained, and the sweet, witty illustrations make me laugh every time. The only problem is that my child doesn't want to wait for me to pore over the pictures of the funny sheep! Definitely a great book, especially to keep parents entertained while reading to their children.
1847940323|5.0|I loved this book.  At first I thought, ut oh, this is not going to be for me.  But once I got through all the animal metaphors my \\"ut ohs\\" became \\"Ahha's!\\".  This book gives great ways to think about how to think about all types of problems that just won't go away.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Welcome back to Gatlin. Ethan survived Lena's Sixteen Moon Claiming only to encounter his worst fear; losing the girl he hoped to hold onto forever. However, she isn't lost to the darkness or an unforeseen foe as feared; instead Lena tortured by grief and blame from that night has retreated inside herself, leaving Ethan desperate to find a path back into her heart. Ethan spends his summer days working in the library with Marian and her new assistant and protege, Liv. Unexpectedly, he finds a new friend in this quirky, British girl, who wears a large watch that tracks the moon on her wrist. Meanwhile, an enigmatic, Harley riding, Caster boy has stormed into town and inexplicably entangled himself into Lena's destiny. Then the unthinkable happens; Ethan hears a whisper in his mind and then, \\"they were gone, the voice and the girl. Like a soap bubble, or cotton candy, or the last silvery sliver of a dream.\\" Ethan is determined to find Lena, for she will always be his destination, his trail to home. He, along with Liv and the garden shear toting, Link, enter the strange, twisting labyrinth that burrows under the town and beyond. In the Caster Tunnels they encounter a world where place and time do not conform to normal, Mortal world parameters. The trio along with the renegade cat, Lucille Ball, soon find themselves popping in and out all over the South. Around each bend and curve the unexpected awaits and with each leg of his journey he uncovers life changing information. His fate and family tree, like it or not, are completely entangled with the Casters. Everyone and Everything are not what they seem in this world where \\"in Light there is Dark, and in Dark there is Light.\\" Guided by an arc light and a haunting, new, shadowing song Ethan races to find Lena. Along the way he just may find his destiny and hopefully retrieve the heart of the girl he loves but will he reach her before the arrival of the Seventeenth Claiming Moon?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*This book out shined it's predecessor. The story is a journey filled with so many twists, turns and surprises. Some of the revelations are astounding! I loved the strange Caster tunnels, with each bend or fork an unanticipated encounter or an astounding piece to the puzzle. Gatlin has more than a few secret skeletons hiding in the closets. I appreciated the new information that shed light on some of the lingering questions from the previous book. I was stunned time and time again by the secrets of characters I thought I knew. The story is complex and enthralling.<br />*The beloved cast favorites from the first book are back with a couple of great additions. The blonde, blue eyed, Liv is the opposite of Lena, she is funny, quirky and brimming with helpful information, she is a refreshing new addition. I loved the finicky, feline, Lucille Ball. She is an escapee from the Great Aunts, who finds her way to Ethan. She continually appears in the most unexpected places. Of course Ethan, our hero is back, since this book is about his journey of self discovery and the unearthing of his destiny. As always he is courageous and steadfast. His character growth is tremendous. Link is better than ever! I adore his hilarious comments and resolute loyalty to Ethan. His quick wit, charming manners and skill with the garden shears will disarm any girl. He is always game for anything no questions asked and he remains either a \\"step ahead or a step behind.\\" Ridley, the sassy, sultry, sweet sucking Siren returns; perhaps there is a sliver of sweetness in her after all. She is a bag of flavored suckers, you never know whether she will be sweet or sour. The formidable Alma is prevalent throughout; with a sharp tongue, her wooden spoon with the hole in the middle, The One Eyed Menace, and a bag of chicken bones and charms, she is ready to wrestle with anyone or anything intent on harming her boys. She can whip Ethan and Link in line with a dark look, a pointed, long, boney finger or in Link's case threats to reveal what he did in her basement when he was nine. I am dying to know the details of Link's escapade in Amma's basement. The three, half senile, ancient, bad hat wearing and endearing Great Aunt's are delightful as ever. They are brimming with their own Gatlin secrets. I love whiling away the hours with my friends in Gatlin.<br />*I am a Western girl but I adore the South and long to visit there. The authors bring the Old South alive for me; resplendent in all of it's finery from the great history, the delectable food, the proud aristocracy, the superstitions, long held traditions and simply Southern sayings. They invite you in with the promise of some good ole Southern home cooking and a tall glass of sweet tea and once you are settled in they spin their stories. Reading this series makes me want to visit the South more than ever.<br /><br />And The Not So Much:<br />*John Breed, he seems to be an important player but he is vague and under developed. There is scarcely any insight into his character, to the point where he appears to be flat in contrast to the other strong, vivid players. He needs more breadth and depth.<br />*This is a complex story filled with a vast array of characters and details it is a lot to keep straight. When reading this be on your toes and pay attention. This is a book you want to stick with, if you lay it aside (not that you will want to) you may find yourself lost. This story line is slow at first, it starts with Lena's pessimism and drama, which I found boring and uninteresting, but then the story moves into the tangles of the tunnels and the fun begins! There is a cliff hanger ending but it is not as dreadful as the first. You are left with some disturbing new insight.<br />*Lena, again I struggled with her character, she remains conflicted and dramatic. She needs to seize her powers and become the indomitable girl I know that she is capable of becoming.<br /><br />This second installment of the Caster's Chronicles was an astounding achievement. I loved being able to spend more time with the endearing citizens of Gatlin. This book is stuffed with clandestine information and shocking surprises that will amaze and thrill you. If you enjoyed the first book you will love the second. If you have yet to delve into the pages I suggest you do so, as book three, Beautiful Chaos, is bound to lead further into Gatlin's hidden world of dark secrets.<br /><br />Favorite Quotations:<br />\\"Around here, our traditions were traditional it was hard to put a finger on them. They were woven into everything we did or, more often, didn't do.<br /><br />\\"High school sucked. It was a universal truth, and whoever said these were supposed to be the best years of your life was probably drunk or delusional.\\"<br /><br />\\"Free time means free trouble, and you got heaps of that already.\\"<br /><br />\\"Then you had better stop talkin' ta old ladies and meet the trouble halfway, so there'll only be half as much.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's not easy to be Light when you have been Dark.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|I loved Twilight. And I will admit, with each book, it got worse. Breaking Dawn was \\"ok\\". But I do admit the first time I read it, I read to the part where she started \\"drinking blood\\" before she was a vampire and I got grossed out a little bit.  However, a few months later, my curiosity got the best of me: I FINALLY READ IT. And I do like the ending a lot. Really do not like the middle parts. I got extremely bored during Jacob's section. But, before the movies came out, I didn't like Jacob much :-/ Don't hate me! I like him a lot better now!  Anyway, I've read the book completely through twice now. And I was going to a third time, before the movie release, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  All-in-all: My least favorite of the 4.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have already watched it 6 x's. I got this movie for a grat price and delivered on time. I would recomend this movie to all adults.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie.  It had a good plot and the characters were developed just enough so that you got an insight into them.  There was just enough to keep you guessing.... good movie.  Recommend.
0811879542|5.0|The only reason I can suggest not to buy this wonderful and fun book is that you, as a parent, are going to get so tired of reading it. It's my sons favorite book and we have read it 5 times a day for the past two weeks. Such a simple book but it's a gem.
0689878451|5.0|Got this book for my grand daughter and it is absolutely adorable and also teaches a valuable lesson. It doesn't matter who loves you as long as you are loved.....
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I cannot fathom how anyone couldn't love this book. It had me from the first chapter. It simply sucked me in, and did not let go.   The descriptions are vivid and fantastic. I could see, feel, hear, feel everything. The various tents, the rooms in the labyrinth, the costumes, the food, the acts... amazing.  The author skillfully weaves plotlines, bringing them through time to an amazing culmination. Characters came alive for me.  I feel like I LIVED this book. I will be reading it again and again to reap any subtleties I failed to discern originally.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|First off, since almost every review sings the praises of the content of this book, I will start with the more pressing concern of the grammatical errors that seem to have come with previous versions of this kindle book. Most reviews I read said the book was riddled with editing mistakes almost to the point that it was unreadable, which almost deterred me from downloading it. I was, however pleasently surprised to find it almost error-free after finishing it. It would seem that the good people of Amazon read the reviews and act upon them. So if you are like me and are hesitant to buy this because you are scared of too many typos, fear not and enjoy this excellent novel.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|I am late discovering Ray LaMontagne but Beg,Borrow & Steal was my first introduction to him and I was haunted by the familarity of the song. It sounded like a Joni Mitchell song but I had never heard this one (her influence is apparent). When I found out the singer I immediately downloaded it. After listening to it 20 times in a row I realized I needed more and purchased the CD. Wow, I have listened to this CD at least 75 times or more since I bought it. It's compelled me to listen for months. I have listened to the samples of his other albums but this is the one that does it for me. Some feel the lyrics are cliche but I just think the combo of melody, voice and words combine to make a lovely listening experience.

1569242739|5.0|A great addition to the collection of Vegan cookery books written by Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero.  The recipes make delicious cupcakes and dreamy frostings and fillings for these delectable delights.
B004L07KWQ|3.0|could use selectable colors, hard to create a nice sunburst around a sun with so random colorization. multitouch should create independent lines. instead of point to point straight lines. shake to clear is cool, very etchasketch.
B004MKLRQA|5.0|An incredible book of courage and honesty.  It should be required reading for young adults and elders alike for understanding how our experiences can change our personalities from warm and loving to vicious creatures.  Also how amazing that the journey back to the childhood is possible even tho lingering scars remain.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|In Kitchen Confidential, the restaurant business is a swimming duck--serenity and elegance above the water and all mad paddling underneath. Behind the soft music and white clad tables supporting the sparkling crystal and silver employed by elegantly clad diners is the mad mayhem of the commercial kitchen.  Mr. Bourdain evokes the sights, sounds and smells of multi-lingual shouting, flashing knives, mounds of vegetables, fiery hot ovens, stacks of plates, expertly and not so expertly manipulated by chefs, sous-chefs, line cooks, and expediters in some of those kitchens.  Who knew?<br /><br />Hilarious, profane and vulgar, Kitchen Confidential is unexpectedly literate; an ode to delicious food and the colorful characters who prepare it. The prep school and Vassar educated Bourdain draws on film and literature to draw the reader into working kitchens he likens to chaotic war zones complete with blood spatters and kill emblems.  Blisters, callouses, and scars are badges of honor in Bourdain's world and his facility with language takes the reader on a vivid voyage through a frenetic, frustrating and ultimately satisfying day, typical at Les Halles. Frank observations on the realities of life as a chef, the personalities who choose such a life and advice to aspiring chefs are interspersed with vignettes of the roller coaster career that has led Bourdain to stardom in the kitchen and on TV.<br /><br />Fans of Bourdain's work on the Travel Channel will be pleased to know that he writes exactly the way he narrates No Reservations.  He contemptuously dismisses the pretentious and the incompetent, but his reverence for the creation of delicious food shines throughout the pages. Quoting Shakespeare and Jack Kerouac with equal aplomb, Bourdain's wit and insightful candor make Kitchen Confidential a must read for foodies.
0470901071|5.0|I have 5 months of network admin experience and a 2 year degree in networking... just so you know where I'm coming from.  The only material I used for actually studying for the cert was this book and some packet tracer labs I found on the cisco forums.  I scored VERY high on the 640-802.  It's tough to say if one book alone could prepare you for the cert if you have no prior experience or knowledge of networking, but if there is one, this is it!  As most other reviewers will agree, it's amazing how well Todd explains subnetting and how easy he makes it.  That was probably my favorite chapter of the book.  This book definitely deserves 5 stars and was the main reason I did so well on my exam.  Thanks for such a great book Todd... and good luck to everyone else trying to become CCNAs!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have to admit, the first time I listened to this CD I wasn't all that crazy about it.  But....after the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and so on & so on.....I really love it!!  I find myself singing these songs all day.  My favorites are \\"Don't you remember\\", \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\", which is my personal favorite!, \\"One & Only\\" - but they are all so very good.    Basically, I'm glad I did not give up on the CD after the first listen - it really grows on ya!  I keep it on in my office all day long.
B005IY3DP2|2.0|This is a very odd album. A couple of songs are really good: 'Days are forgotten' is among their best, 'I hear voices' is a departure from the classic Ksabian sound that will probably end up being an underappreciated highlight, and Re-wired isn't bad at all.   The problem with the album is that it seems that the band has decided to go Cro Magnon on us (or Genghis Khan, makes for a better wordplay, see review title) trying hard to appear hard: they scream, they are rough, they have velociraptors (!). Look at the totally unnecessary screaming in Switchblade Smile, or the totally ridiculous cover artwork (a serious contender for worst CD cover artwork ever). I think they need to get a serious producer who will highlight the good moments of Serge's songwriting and will tone down the pedantic brute effect. They are too good of a band to waste their talent on trying to act as a second rate Black Sabbath tribute band.
B004Z4LVZK|5.0|This book was a great start to the series with awesome action and a really solid mystery plot line. It had a great main character, Thomas, who is a mystery within the mazes mystery. Just to say this book was WICKED. Wink, Wink.  ;)
0062502174|5.0|Always the one you are looking for is the one that is looking.   Coelho is a great story teller.  Taking wisdom of the treasure and leading the reader through  the discovery and transformation of the character who is searching  yet, all along the treasure is under your feet.
B005NXD6PA|5.0|First, let me summarize my musical tastes in regards to female artists. I appreciate PJ Harvey, Tori Amos & Fiona Apple primarily. Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie by Alanis was a great album too, but I don't care for her later stuff. I care about lyrics, vocal quality, & meaning. I also like there to be a little something more going on musically than just an acoustic guitar. The whole \\"girl with a guitar\\" thing does not really work for me. So, all that said...<br /><br />Lana Del Rey is the most compelling female artist I have heard in years. I listen to new music all the time, HOPING to find something that interests me  or catches my attention the way that my other favorite female artists have done in the past. Lana Del Rey does it.<br /><br />I absolutely cannot wait for her album. I love the orchestrations, her voice, her delivery, her lyrics...I couldn't care less about her image or who came up with it. I don't look at her when I play my I-pod. From my understanding she had a musical career loooong before her new image, so the talent is there. Believe me, the talent is freaking there.<br /><br />If I play these two songs anymore my Ipod may blow up or something, my infatuation with them is really that bad. Simply amazing. Video Games moves me to tears on my drive to work in the morning and Blue Jeans captures every desperate, crying in the kitchen floor moment of your heartbroken youth that you sometimes wish you could forget about.
0385344325|5.0|I just got turned on to the Jack Reacher series a month ago. I started with \\"Second Son\\", and that single made me so darned curious about this guy that I ended up reading every book in the series!   I wish I could find another series with a character just like him. Even with all his faults (and he has a few) like wearing the same clothes for days at a time...Really? and head butting bad guys way to many times per book,(I mean how hard can his forehead really be?), and I could so live with out all the gun and ammo specs,but...  as usual Jack is 3 steps ahead of everyone else and it's almost scary the way he gets into all the criminal and crazies minds. I love that all the women in the series are strong and smart and Jack not only gives them props, he counts on them every bit if not more than the men in the series.   I won't go into what this books about,since everyone else has said it all, but if you like to read mysteries,with lots of action,and enjoy men who are crazy smart and 6'5\\" tall,then please give this series a whirl!  [[ASIN:B004P8JPS6 The Affair: A Reacher Novel (Jack Reacher)]]
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love the game itself, but I especially love the lessons on avian taxonomy included.  I had no idea pigs were skilled enough at foraging to steal bird eggs, maybe they are a special breed (evident by being green).  Also we see a nature lesson come to life as many different bird species are presented: Bluebird, Blackbird, Redbird, Boomerangbird, and others!  It is like a PBS documentary on ornithology.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I just love Hawaii Five 0 with Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Cann.  The DVD is just great and now I can watch last year, Season One, any time I want to.  The action is great, lines between Alex and Scott are really funny and they interact so well.  I just love the scenery, Hawaii is so beautiful.  I was there twice and would love to go back there but this is better than nothing.  It is great seeing Alex shirtless, what a body.  He is so gorgeous and that smile.  WOW.  I pre-ordered this DVD from Amazon and got a great price.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I will keep this short, but I just love this movie so much.  I think I actually need stitches from all the laughing.  Three guys wake up in Vegas (Sin City) and try to remember what happened to them the night before.  I won't ruin anything for you, but the part with Mike Tyson's tattoo always floors me.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|This paint app is great. Very easy to use, and fun to play with. Fun for all from my 1 year old to my 7 year old even I like to play with it.
0345350499|5.0|Such a great perspective. Totally different take on the King Arthur story, and a multi-generational tale too. Have read it multiple times and still love it.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|If you have not yet experienced Chickenfoot, what rock have you been living under? The second effort from this supergroup is even better than the first. There is not a single track on the album that does not hit.   The sound is remniscent of Hagar era Van Halen with better guitar work. Eddie is good but Joe is better without a doubt. Joe Satriani has every lick of Eddie Van Halen and a whole lot more that Eddie doesn't. All I can say to the re-formed DLR Van Halen is that their new album better not suck. Chickenfoot is putting out music better than anything Van Halen had put out in decades. Michael Anthony takes it over the top with his signature backing vocals and solid bass riffs.   I've got love for the VH folks but Wolfgang is no Michael Anthony and as anyone who heard Van Halen 3 knows, Eddie is not a good songwriter. Hopefully David Lee Roth will bring some legitimacy back to VH but in the meantime, if you want all of the great sounds with none of the drama, Chickenfoot is the band to follow and Chickenfoot III is the record to buy.
B004US4K2C|5.0|Looks great and performs really well. Wish I had used this application sooner to replace the stock launcher on my galaxy s.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|This is a very basic paint app FOR KIDS.  The functions are minimal and easy to figure out, which is EXACTLY what they should be in an app geared towards young children.  So if you are expecting something brilliant and full of options,  look for a fancier one for adults.  My 6 yr. old will love it.
B004OBQQPY|5.0|This is a brilliant film about a fascinating person. Probably the best film I've seen in recent years. I never heard about Senna and never saw a formula 1 racing but after watching this film, I read tons of materials on line, watched clips on youtube and bought a book about Senna. I'm glad the film was presented in a theatre close to where I live.Saw it numerous times. Fascinating. For those in US, wait until it comes out on a DVD carefully done (subtitles, etc.) It's worth it!
B004L07KWQ|3.0|While I do like the idea of random brush and background colors, it severely needs a &quot;clear all&quot; feature. It severely needs this feature since the app slows down with too many lines. I, as I'm sure my kids as well, do like the ability to take or use a photo to draw on. I feel like &quot;photo&quot; and &quot;take picture&quot; could be consolidated into one menu button, thereby making spaces for a clear button. Could stand apart from all the other typical painting apps for its uniqueness, but not until it receives this much needed improvement.
030746363X|5.0|I've long been a fan of Tim Ferriss and his no-holds-barred approach to personal experimentation. This book is an enlightening blend of technical info, (which he advises you to forsake if you prefer so as to get to the practical steps), personal discoveries, and most importantly practical info. It's full of bottom line fixes and plans to put into action immediately. Despite the seemingly outrageous claims his techniques are legit. Do yourself a favor and dive into the deep end with this soon to be classic book. Bravo Tim! Keep em' coming!
1400069181|5.0|Very inspiring book. Not a how to book but more for motivation. Easy to read. I'm starting a business and I have bookmarked some passages for future reference. This book gives business a good name.
160094048X|5.0|I admit, I've only had the opportunity to make one recipe from this book so far, that being the Chocolate Fudgy Oatmeal Cookies. They were relatively easy to make, and the resulting cookie was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, like you want a cookie to be. But for me, this one single recipe was a dream come true, because this cookie recipe tastes *exactly* like the cocoa oatmeal cookies my late grandmother used to make every single Christmas. I was only 10 when she passed, so I never thought to ask her for the recipe before she got sick, and unfortunately neither did my parents. My father tried these cookies right after I made them, and the first thing he said was that he thought he'd never get to have anything that tasted like his mom's cocoa oatmeal cookies again. My mother has already secured a promise from me to make more as soon as this batch is gone. That one cookie recipe is worth its weight in gold, at least in my opinion. Thanks, Isa and Terry - you brought back a part of my childhood that I thought was gone forever.<br /><br />(I originally added this as a comment, but decided to add it as a amendment to my original review.)<br />It's a year on now (11/28/12), and I've since made 10 or 11 other recipes from the book. But I'm not here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about peanut butter chocolate pillows. OH MY GOD. If you have been holding out on getting this book, they are *the* reason to buy it. Hubs is constantly after me to make them, and every weekend when I see my friends, they bug me with \\"when are you gonna make those chocolate peanut butter things again?\\"
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|I have been reading Lee Child's \\"Reacher\\" series from the beginning and this one fills in much of the background of Jack Reacher which are hinted at in the earlier books. The only problem is when an author jumps back in time for a new novel featuring an action hero we know that he is going to survive at the end of the book otherwise the others could not have been written which takes some of the tension out of the story. If I was new to the series I would read them in a different order with \\"second son\\" a short story first which deals with Reader's childhood and then this one followed by the others in the sequence they were written in.<br />This book like most of the rest although part of a series work well as a stand alone book. The plot in places is thin and relies much on the fact that \\"small town USA\\" has little in the way of modern forensics available to the local sheriff otherwise the plot would unravel very quickly. It is however an enjoyable book not as fast moving as some of the others in the series and portrays a slightly more thoughtful Reacher. A worthy addition to the series.
6305428042|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child and being amazed at how great it was. Even watching this movie years later it can bring back the same feelings that I had when I was younger. The best part is watching of the parts that terrified me and wondering how I was so scared. Definitely one of my favorite Halloween movies of all time and a definite classic!
1573228737|5.0|In reading the gothic psychological novel Affinity, it is nearly impossible to shake off an overwhelming feeling of gloom and pervasive dread. Following a failed suicide attempt, a young \\"lady visitor\\" named Margaret Prior develops a relationship with an inmate named Selina Dawes in a Victorian women's prison, and both their lives are forever changed by their acquaintance.   Narrated in alternating chapters by the two very different women, this dark, moody story incites fear, melancholy, and terrible pity. As always, with this author's work comes a thoroughly researched story and a compelling look at women in oppressive circumstances, as well as how their limited choices often lead to desperate attempts to control their own destinies. There's also an erotic undercurrent of forbidden attraction running deep in this novel as Margaret finds herself increasingly drawn to the mysterious Selina Dawes, who has been imprisoned for a spiritualist reading gone horribly wrong. Their subtly blooming attraction is heightened by the misery of the contrast with Selina's living conditions at Millbank Prison (an actual London prison, by the way), and it's a certainty that in Margaret's desire to save Selina, she is also desperate to save herself.   Sarah Waters writes in dense, elegant prose and tells stories that unfold with exquisite deliberation. Affinity is similar to The Little Stranger, in that there are such evocative, spine-chilling moments that I literally had to put the book down and step away from it. She masterfully creates an atmosphere of suffocating melancholy and builds the tension to an almost unbearable point, so that when the characters finally break, there is a blessed emotional release and relief in the confusion and madness that follows.   As with all of the authors' novels, it's important not to read too many reviews or interviews lest important surprises are spoiled. I've read enough of her books to know that I needed to pay attention to every word that is uttered, but she still kept me guessing until the devastating end. If you decide to read this, try to save it for a day when it's cold and dreary and drizzling; I did, and my imagination nearly went wild over the awful conditions of the prison, as well as the evocative seances I could picture perfectly in my mind. Affinity isn't the typical jump-out-of-the-closet horror novel, but for the reader who appreciates subtlety and who might feel a fine shiver when things don't feel quite right in the house, it can offer an incredibly suspenseful and terrifying read.
1587613379|5.0|I've been practicing Ethical Sluttery for 18 months now and it's all down to the September Edward Carpenter Community's Gay Men's Weeks!  It all started in September 2009- \\"The Dance Between Power and Intimacy\\"-my first ECC experience and, there I was, all alone.  Back home I was in a long-term relationship. The erotic expression of our love for each other had stopped years before. We were maintaining a monogamous tradition fearing the potential destabilising consequences of messing with the arrangement. I had been interested in meditation as a homphobia-free means of satisfying my hunger for spiritual nourishment and, I suppose, at the time I was searching for a spiritual home.  The workshops during that week helped me to put my monogamous sexual barriers down. I explored how the experience of erotic sexual massage could combine with spiritual meditative practice and how loving intimacy was rapidly fostered between individuals who were prepared to engage in vulnerable-making self-exposure. I didn't realise at the time that this would set a foundation for me to embark on a path of authentic personal growth and enable me to engage in loving encounters like never before. Wow!  When I returned from the week I was on fire! The stakes were high but I had to risk discussing with my partner making changes to the 12-year-old monogamous agreement we made when we'd first met. Being a naturally jealous bloke his reaction was to be cautiously OK about it. We agreed to me doing sexual things outside the relationship provided I would tell him what happened if he asked but not to tell him if he didn't ask. I love him and I didn't want to hurt him but I also sensed a chance to grow emotionally, spiritually and sexually. Here was a genie, which could not be popped back into its bottle.  A good friend made on this first Gay Men's Week introduced me to the Faeries and I went to three gatherings that year- Featherstone Castle, Folleterre and Wansee. As is often the case I came away from each of these gatherings with something important learned about myself. Featherstome held a mirror up to my life-long approval seeking programming. Folleterre helped me to reflect on how my father's [patriarchy's] disapproval of the feminine aspects of my nature set the scene for not only my internalised homophobia but also a kind of internalised misogyny of which I had been previously completely unaware. Wansee opened my eyes to how the way I presented myself to others was profoundly affected by fear of shame and social rejection.  So it was in the context of this roller coaster ride of personal growth and self-discovery that I was introduced to The Ethical Slut    I wasn't sure if it was possible to be a Really Dirty Slut and to also be a Really Good Person at the same time. This book showed me how!  The authors reclaim the abusive term Slut in the same way that Queer has been reclaimed for marginal sexual orientation and gender identity and in the same way that Faerie is reclaimed to proudly assert our sissy natured-ness. `Sluts' are those who dare to have sex more often, and in less conventional ways, than everyone else and, who refuse to be cowed into submitting to the social norms. `Ethical Sluts' are those who do this openly, honestly, lovingly and caringly with the intention of harming no one.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is stopping themselves from having, or openly admitting to having desired ethical sex out of fear that it would be immoral, socially disapproved of and because the consequences would mean guilt and social exclusion.  The authors convincingly argue that our society is geared towards regulating sexual relationships so they fit into monogamous, politically and economically acceptable hetero-imitative configurations, which provide ostensibly stable environments for habitat-living-style-consumerism and child rearing. They confront the idea that sexual relationships exist in a `starvation economy'-' i.e. that there aren't enough sexual relationships to go around and so sexual relationships need to be jealously protected and safeguarded. They argue that there is an infinite potential for sexual relationships of all shapes and sizes and the key to accessing these in order to meet one's many and varied sexual appetites is, firstly, honesty in communication with one's partners and, secondly, negotiating clear unambiguous agreements which enable the involved partners to feel emotionally safe and secure.  Of course it isn't all necessarily going to be a bed of roses and it would be surprising if jealousies didn't arise in polyamorous arrangements. The authors present convincing arguments about how the working through of jealousies is a potentially very good thing both for the development of the affected individuals but also for the relevant relationships.  It could even be possible that `compersion' -the emotion of joy at one's partner's happiness with another sexual partner might even prevail!  The interesting thing about becoming honestly polyamorous [as opposed to the conventional dishonest non-consensual non-monogamous pattern of polyamory-or `having an affair'- prevalent in western cultures] is that it allows you to enjoy a wide variety of sexual partners without having to lie or feel bad about it. And rather than distancing you from love and spirit it has the potential to deepen you spiritual growth too. If that isn't enough to convince, you also get a chance to feel the full force of conventional societal disapproval and to work on your own issues of guilt shame and approval seeking!  Read the book and start to change the world!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I just got this CD and absolutely love it. For the past few years, I've been hoping Evanescence would come out with a new album soon. Now that they have, I think it was definitely worth the wait. It's still very much Evanescence, but they experimented with many different sounds that end up making this album sound familiar, but unique, and I love every second of it! I don't actually dislike any songs on this CD, but I think my favorites are The Change, Erase This, and Oceans. The bonus tracks are all awesome as well, so it's definitely worthwhile to get the deluxe edition instead of the regular one. My only problem with it is the CD's packaging is a little awkward. It's hard to get the CD out without hitting the DVD. But overall, this is a great CD and definitely deserves a 5/5 rating!
B005974C94|5.0|When two musicians like this join forces, magic happens. The entire show is a non-stop thrill. An remarcable version of Icecream, the sublime, never-get-old, Layla (with a un-freakin'-believable new orleans jazz twist that made me wet my pants) and the feature of the \\"new\\" blues star, Keb'Mo'.  This is a great album to have, for hard-core blues fans and the youngsters that want to know what's this music about.
B005IY3CMQ|2.0|only one song was listenable through the track, which was ripped out of one CD.  maybe this was a collector's item for enthusiastic fans
B005SH5K7I|3.0|It's a cute movie, but animals trying to help a human in relationships...  it was a bit much.  Worse that his character was actually taking their advice (ie peeing to mark his territory?).  Not a big fan of them portraying a guy as such a loser.  The loser part was a bit overacted.... as usual.  Oh well, it's entertainment right?  LOL  All in all, don't expect to be impressed.  Expect a silly movie and have fun.
B000BJS4TO|4.0|I love the music on this cd I wish it was longer. As soon as I received it I had it in my cd player.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Finally a movie based on a comic book that was based on a day of the week (Thursday) that was based on a Norse god that was based on Norse Mythology.   Thor is one of the latest Marvel movies that is but a piece in the big puzzle that is \\"The Avengers\\" in which almost every character and their actor from a recent marvel movie reprise their role. Thor has an outstanding cast that features 2 Oscar winners (and a nominee).  The plot isnt that true to the source material but is good enough. Thor, the norse god of thunder, pisses off his father and is banished to earth powerless. There Thor must learn humility if he ever return home.  The special effects as you would expect in such a film, same with costumes. But the scenes of Asgard are magnificent. The movie itself is good but it isnt the best out of the \\"Avengers\\" tie in movies, it might be the worst but that doesnt make it bad. The Iron Man films and The Incredible Hulk were way better because they stayed true to the comic.  The special features are pretty good:  -Commentary by Director Kenneth Branagh  -A marvel One shot \\"The The Consultant\\": A short film that takes place between the ending of \\"Iron Man\\" and the ending of \\"The Incredible Hulk\\", which shows the events leading up to the \\"Incredible Hulk\\" end credits scene  -Deleted scenes- with option commentary  -Road to the Avengers: A 2 minute trailer/discussion about the upcoming film  -7 Featurettes:  *From Asgard to Earth: A behind the scenes look at the film  *Our fearless leader: Cast talking about the director  *Assembling the Troupe: A look at the cast  *Hammer Time: Talking about Thor's hammer  *Creating Laufey: A look at the actor and makeup behind the frost giant Laufey  *Music of the Gods: A look at the music  *A Conversation: \\"Thor\\" co creator Stan Lee talking about the movie  Either way, buy this.  Pros:  -Another piece to the \\"Avengers\\" movie puzzle  -The cast  -Special features  -Asgard looks awesome  -Special effects are good  -Costumes  Cons:  -They did change too much of the origin  -Not the best out of the recent \\"Avengers\\" tie in movies
B001RCD2DW|5.0|Quick Introduction:<br />My name is Jack and I am a architecture student at the NewSchool of Architecture in San Diego, CA.<br />I am by NO means a musically inclined or talented individual, however, I love listening to music for hours on end. We listen to music all day in studio, and it becomes a necessity to jam all night when pulling 36-hour stretches on projects.<br /><br />That being said, I have owned quite a few headphones in search for the perfect one. Sony has always been a favorite of mine.<br />Of note is the size of my head, which, because being larger than average creates a comfort and fit issue with most headphones. I personally love over the ear cans and it is extremely difficult to find headphones that fully encompass the entire earlobe with almost no contact. The AKG K702s do just that. The velvet pads are basically touching your head all around your ears but almost nothing is on your ear, or pushing on it. So, in summary, they are extremely comfortable.<br /><br />Now, I feel like it would be slightly superfluous to mention that the sound quality of these things are unlike anything you have ever heard. But, I think I want to say one thing about these headphones that sets them apart, because yes, the sound quality is amazing. More importantly though, they have a unique feature that is so understated, it is rarely stated. These K702s create an uncanny experience where it sounds like the music is coming from another audio source in the room a few feet away from you. If you close your eyes during an acoustical solo, you'd think the guitarist is sitting in a chair right in front of you. Listening to electronic/dance music is eerily like being in the club for real. There is a light, but not too light, airy feel to the music. An imaginary space between the speakers and your ears, such that it does not sound like little speakers on your head, rather, it sounds room-filling, and encompassing, as if from a high quality stereo system in your office.<br /><br />Let me get to the point of this review. It took a lot of motivation for me to actually write a review. Because, as much as I appreciate everybody else's reviews on Amazon, for some reason I rarely leave them myself.<br /><br />Long story short, I owned a pair of K702s previously but needed money desperately to buy materials for a school project so I sold them (easy sale, by the way) to a fellow student on campus. Now, a month or so later I got some money back and wanted to replace my amazing headphones, but, I decided to \\"upgrade\\" a little and get the white AKG Q701 model. BIG MISTAKE!!! I received the AKG Q701s on a Thursday afternoon and submitted a refund form on Amazon the same evening. I then went on to order the K702s prior to writing this review.<br /><br />So to recap, I owned the K702s, sold them, bought the Q701s, returned them, and purchased the K702s now for a second time! Why would I go through all this you ask? Simple. The Q701s are IDENTICAL to the K702s and maybe even the K701s. The only difference(besides the COST): the colors, the cables, and the BUILD QUALITY. Wow AKG, you really left me hanging. The pictures online look really nice and maybe I am going overboard on what could be a fluke, but seriously, the build quality seems to be lacking. Especially considering the price. To top everything off, my Q701s were cracked!!! Maybe it happened during shipment, maybe AKG just doesn't care about these wanna-be-cool-like-Beats headphones. So my advice to you: if you want the best headphones for under $1000, get the K702 or K701 model and you shall be satisfied beyond belief. I can almost guarantee it. Even if my guarantee is worthless to anybody, I mean it!<br />(Oh and by the way, if you didn't pick up my subtleties a moment ago, the Beats headphones are probably the most garbage products you could buy, comparatively, in my opinion.)/>Let me get to the point of this review.

B004L07KWQ|2.0|Not worth $1. The Application is fun and entertaining for very, very young kids, however due to its simplicity of having zero options I say this seems to be a free app that someone put a price tag on.  This paid version should allow for more options. Suggested options: Rainbow Effect (Removes random colors and follows a rainbows color spectrum), Primary only (just the colors red, blue and yellow), and finally a Color wheel (pick the color). Leave the random brush sizes but the &quot;random colors only&quot; option is starting to annoy even my 5 &amp; 7 year old daughters.
B004OEIL5E|3.0|Now Scream 2 is a sequel that I'm off & on with I can watch it for the returning characters it also has some good gore  good suspense & I like the score. I know people say this is the best sequel & some say 4 but for me it's just preferance Scream 3 is my favorite sequel I'll get to why in that review. I feel this sequel was rushed cause Scream was a surprise hit & they put it out a year after Scream 1. But I like it cause of the returning characters  Sidney, Dewey, Gale,  Randy & Cotten Weary. You have some newer characters Timothy Olyphant as Mickey, Lurie  Metcalf as Debbie Salt aka Mrs Loomis, Jerry O'Conell as Derek,  Elise Neal as Hallie & Jada Pinkett in a small role. Story is a year after Scream 1 Sidney is in College now & has a dorm mate Hallie. A movie was made called Stab loosely based off of Gale Weathers book you have a young couple which the girl is played by Jada Pinkett Smith. She's not happy that her boyfriend is taking her to see a slasher movie. The Stab movie opens up like the 1st movie with Casey Becker only Heather Graham plays Stab Casey & she's getting ready to get a show but for some reason there's popcorn on the stove. In fact the stuff filmed for The Stab  movie was filmed by Robert Rodriguez & that little scene was better than Machete or Predators but those 2 movies are why I call him Rob Rod now. So the Jada Pinkett Smith character is off getting some popcorn. Her Boyfriend is killed in the bathroom & then she gets stabbed by the killer a few times & I like where she dies in front of theater screen it's not bad gore either. The next morning Sidney hears about the murders which she gets her unnerved. You go to a scene in film class & their discussing sequels & Randy gets the line from Aliens wrong & it just bad script writing. You also have the return of Gale Weathers as well as Dewey who is looking for the killer you have a nice back & forth with Dewey & Gale. Cotten Weary comes into the picture & really am I suppose to care about thischaracter. Your introduced to this Woman named Debbie Salt who's a huge fan of Gale you have this  girl named Ci Ci & she's killed. The killer goes afterSidney which Sidney's Boyfriend Derek goes in & he's stabbed in the arm & the cops begin to suspect him. They have no proof. You have a scene where Derek is singing & dancing this could've been cut it's funny but am I watching Scream or Greese. There's a pretty good scene on The Campus where Dewey gets a call from the killer Gale & Dewey are looking for anybody with a cell phone Randy is killed pretty brutally. Cotten won't leave Sidney alone about doing interviews with him & getting publicity. Am I supoose to root for this guy he's arrested & I'm like whatever they had no proof. The Police are going to take Sidney somewhere & Hallie decides to go with her. The Soriety decides to perfom a ritual on Derek that could've been cut. Gale & Dewey are trying to find out who the killer is & their relationship I can buy. Ghostface is there & this scene has some decent suspense. Like Gale is in a room that I guess is soundprof cause Gale is trying to Warn Dewey that Ghostface is behind him he gets stabbed pretty good which they make it look like he died I believe Wes Craven fought for the character to live. Gale runs in to Cotten & his hands are covered in blood & she thinks he's the killer she runs outside where Debbie Salt is at. Now you got a scene that's pretty good where the cops are at a Red Light & Ghostface busts through the window slits a 1 of the cops throat beat up another now 1 of the cops had a clear shot for Ghostface's head & he didn't fire his gun. Ghostface runs him over  & they go through a construction site a pole goes through his head good gore. Sidney & Hallie are stuck in the back Sidney gets in the front can't open passagers side door she has to go through the drivers side window where Ghostface is knocked out. She manages to help Hallie out of the car. She wants to find out who's under the mask but he's gone. Hallie is killed. Sidney runs back to campus where in the theater room she finds Derek tied to a prop. Ghostface comes in while Sidney is unting Derek & he's revealed to be Mickey ok cool a random guy. He shoot Derek & nice little confrontation with Sidney & Mickey where he tells her Billy wanted to get away with it he wants to be caught & have a big trial & he will blame it all on movies where he can pled insanity & get off. They have an ok brawl until he says oh I got a special guest it's Billy's Mom I'm sorry I can't buy Jackie from Roseanne as a killer. Sge tells him how she met Mickey on The Net. She shoots Mickey & basically she wants revenge & she's going to make it look like Sidney & Mickey killed each other. Sidney is snapping cables where the stage props will drop on Jackie from Roseanne. She thinks she got her but she still alive & puts knife to her Cotten shows up & saves Sidney. Mickey gets up Sidney & Gale gun him down & Sidney finishes the job & shoots Mrs Loomis in the head. Scream 2 is decent it just runs longer than it should it felt like Cotten was originally suppose to be the killer cause the script was leaked online. Bad reveal with Lurie Metcalf. It had a rushed production you had too much comedy. Wes Craven did his best with a rushed production. Neve Campbell was good. David Arqutte was good. Jamie Kennedy did what he could. Timothy Olyphant was ok. Lurie Metcalf stick with comedy. Jerry O'Connell is there. Elise Neal isn't bad at all. Courteney Cox was good. I can watch it for the returning characters & the gore & suspense. I'll review  Scream 3 next.
0670022411|4.0|This book draws you in right away and is pretty interesting if you are a history lover.  I enjoyed the rich character development and description and wish I could actually see what they looked like.
B004OEIL5O|4.0|Scream 3 now I know some people didn't care for this sequel but I liked this more than Scream 2 & 4 there decent but I hate the killer reveals in those movies  but Scream 3 still has a bad reveal. But you have David Arqutte doing more than in 1, 2 & 4 Courteney Cox does more in Scream 3 than she does in 4. Kevin Williamson was busy with other projects so a guy named Ehren Kruger wrote it he wrote the script to Arlington Road good movie<br />s  h  i  t  t  y ending. Stars Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arqutte & Liev Schriber again. I like the 3 returning characters. Jenny McCarth makes an apperance. It stars Lance Henriksen as Producer John Milton, Scott Foley as Roman Bridger, Parker Posey as Jenifer Jolie, Patrick Dempsey as Detective Mark Kincaid  & Emiley Mortimer as Angelina Tyler. Sory is Cotten Weary is driving home 1 night & he gets a call from who he thinks is a fan of his talk show 100 percent Cotten. The killer is using a voice amplifier that copies other peoples voices. He tells him that he's in his house & Cotten's girlfriend played by Jenny McCarthy & the killer calls her & she thinks it's Cotten cauase of the voice amplifier & messes with her when Cotten comes home The New Ghostface kills them & he leaves a picture of Sidney Prescott by the bodies. Sidney lives in the country in seclusion. Stab 3 is going through a troubled production. Dewey is helping with the production cause they want somebody who had the experience cause of course Sidney wouldn't do it. Gale decides to find out who the new killer is & she has to put with Jenifer Jolie when plays Stab 3 Gale. Gale is kicked off the set where you get a small appearance by Jay & Silent Bob & they mistake her for Connie Chung & Gale flips them off. The killer is real life people in order of how they die in Stab 3. Jenifer is having some kind of party at her house & Gale & Dewey are looking at pictures of Sidney's Mom when she was young cause the killer is leaving them as calling cards & the background looks like the same studio where Stab 3 is being shot. You got this bodyguard guy going through Dewey's trailer he thinks he's talking to Dewey but it's The New Ghostface he's killed. The pages of the stab 3 script are coming through the Fax Machine a gas line is cut & you have Stab 3 Dewey go in the kitchen uses a lighter to read what the pages say & the house blows up & he dies. Everybody runs for it Ghostface tries to kill Gale Dewey shoots him but he's wearing body armor. Sidney is working from home Ghostface finds out where she lives & has called her he tells her to turn on the news she sees what happend she goes to LA. Randy's sister has a tape he made talking about a trilogy & how everything you thought you knew isn't the truth & how in the 3rd it tries to wrap everything up. Which was why Scream 4 wasn't needed. Gale & Jenifer  look around archives to see if Sidney's Mom was an actress. Sidney runs into the girl playing her in Stab 3 & the production was shut down. The girl drops something she going to find her Sidney walks on The Stab 3 set & she walks in the house that looks like the house at the end of the 1st Scream movie. The killer uses the voice amplifier to mess with Sidney by using her Mom's voice. Not a bad chase through the house Dewey & The this new Cop Detective Kincaid look around the set  & it's starting to look like The Film  Producer John Milton is the killer. Milton says he had a realtionship with Sidney's Mom but she didn't want to be in Hollywood. So Sidney goes with Detective Kincaid for protection. Dewey,  Gale & Jenifer get a call from the killer using Sidney's voice that she's going to be at Milton's house for Roman's Birthday Party. The killer calls Sidney from The Police Department. He has Dewey & Gale tied up he killed Angelina & Jenifer. Sidney comes & shoots Ghostface he gets up cause he's wearing body armor.

B0055Q5F36|4.0|Just got this case today.  It fits the AT&T version of the Galaxy S II just fine.  As noted in another review; there is an opening on the top-left, over the volume buttons, that does not have a matching opening on the phone itself and a small hole at the top of the phone is not open through the case.  I'm not sure what the purpose of this secondary hole on the phone is, but having it covered does not seem to interfere with call quality.<br /><br />The buttons on the case line up flawlessly with those on the phone, though the operation of the buttons does need a firm push with the case on the phone.  This is expected, by me, as the case adds a layer over the buttons.<br /><br />The default screen protector is bunk.<br />First; and this is not a flaw so I didn't rate it down for it, the screen protector is made for the International version of the phone.  There is a hole in the bottom designed for the hardware button these phones have. While I wish the AT&T phone had a physical button, it doesn't.  Don't plan on using this screen protector if you are ordering for an AT&T version of the phone.<br />Second; the screen protector is cheaply made.  This is just like the ones you would expect when you pay $1 or less for one.  I suggest buying a higher quality one, even if you have an International version of the phone.<br />Third; the way the screen protector is packaged inside the case it is very easy to bend and crease during unpacking.<br /><br />As I didn't buy this case for a screen protector, I don't mind that it is bunk.<br /><br />The case itself is very nice and well built.  The silicone \\"glove\\" fits very nicely and is not as \\"sticky\\" as many that I have paid less money to buy.  The hard case adds a nice layer of protection outside the silicone \\"glove.\\"  I do wonder why the corners are left outside the protection of the hard case; but this is not a Defender series case.  If Otterbox makes a Defender for the AT&T version of this phone I will definitely upgrade!<br /><br />Overall I recommend this case, with a caveat that you should buy a screen protector from another source.<br /><br />Shipping was quick and the packaging was well protected.<br /><br />** UPDATE **<br />I added some pictures of the case on the AT&T Galaxy S II (SGH-I777).ou should buy a screen protector from another source.  Shipping was quick and the packaging was well protected.  ** UPDATE **  I added some pictures of the case on the AT&T Galaxy S II (SGH-I777).
0756686970|5.0|Yes, I bought this for my son, 19, for his birthday as he is a SW freak LOL. He loved it but would not take it back to his dorm with him as he was afraid someone may steal it or borrow it and then it would disappear. I like it too, I have been looking at it on and off when I'm waiting for something to occur or whatever. It is a great gift item for those who like Star Wars. Even adults!
1400067936|5.0|Twenty years ago I had a glimpse of rationality: life is ramdom. Not much, not less, just random. I was driving to a client, and looking at the trees aligned with the road, I finally found out that fortune and hazard are two sides of a coin you throw every day on every action, even the small ones. Good news: all great thinks that happen to those fortunate people can actually happen to me - and to everyone. Likewise for the tragic ones. This is a relief, a way of life, a reassuring thought.<br /><br />Taleb goes straight to the point, starting - just starting - with the financial markets. But He goes further, to life at large. His book is should be read by everyone who had the same epiphany,  but mainly by those who did not. So, if you are one of those, read it. It will clear your vision, maybe change your life.<br /><br />Great, great prose, too! So you don't get disappointed if you just like to read books.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|So just watched this film and honestly the film didn't grab me enough to make me lose track of time like other comic book franchise films. Not enough humor and Ryan Reynolds is funny so wondering who wrote such a blah script. I was a fan when I was younger but not so much as collect comics but cartoons on tv and that bit.  Also watch out for the hack of a digital copy being issued. Don't think for a second ultraviolet digital copy is cool because honestly it took 2 hours to download. When technology changes this will be one of the things first out the door, the way they decided to distribute the digital copy is ultra brown like crap. Executives must think before acting. iTunes is the standard so why come up with some flikster air app that takes forever to download the copy. Just because I have a faster connection doesn't mean you can abuse it with trashy software. I downloaded another digital copy before Flikster could respond to me watching green lantern and that was just a mouse click. Crazy right!

0786955554|5.0|For the price you pay you get a lot of really useful tiles. Each is double sided with one side covered in plain tiles and the other featuring some kind of special room or obastacle. A few are black on the back instead of tiles. These can be used to change the shape of a room by being used as chunks of \\"wall\\"  When you open the box it looks like there isn't much there, but once you punch out all the pieces there is quite a lot.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|I've had the free version on my phone for nearly a year &amp; it's been a consistent favorite of my kids.  My 1st grader likes filling up the whole screen and then holding the back button to see it erase each line in order. My toddler just scribbles, but he would sometimes inadvertently tap the ad, so I'm very happy to now have the ad free version. In fact I had looked for an ad free version on the market several months ago, and didn't see this offered.  Thanks to the developer for offering an ad free version.  And it's today's free app, so thanks Amazon.  But even if ?t weren't free, I would gladly pay the buck for it.  This app is perfect at restaurants because it's easy and entertaining for all ages.

0786956127|4.0|I bought this because it's hard to come by good outdoor tiles. There are a lot of options here, which can make some very flexible outdoor maps. Some of the tiles are a little confusing however. One tile is obviously some sort of cliff face, but no matter which way you turn, it doesn't look like one side is higher than the other in the artwork. Also, all the tree tiles have a giant ball of fire on the back. While fireballs can be useful, it seems odd to include so many. I guess it would be good for a forest fire.  Overall, very nice set of tiles.

The same point could be made of other world regions as well (South America, South Asia, Eastern Europe).<br /><br />Her writing style keeps the reader interested.

We had quite a lively discussion about it and most ended up feeling like I did. We were priviliged to have a Korean exchange student, who lived with one of our members, come in from her classes during our discussion . She verified that this is the long standing way of Asian culture. She was glad that things had changed for her sake.  Wonder how in the heck Amy's girls  would even  speak to her.  But at least she had her dogs!!!

0451232577|4.0|Grand in scope and history, this 900++ page book, the first of a trilogy, starts off with the events leading up to World War I.  The characters represent different areas in society as well as different social and political leanings.  One thing Follett does extremely well in this book is he makes it easy to follow them and keep them straight.  Second, he makes it clear how war will effect each of them individually.  It is a good book, and I look forward to the rest of the story.

The answer to this question: YES.<br /><br />Starman (Jeff Bridges), a space alien, clones the form of a widow's (Karan Allen) dead husband.  He convinces her to drive him to a certain location (\\"Landing Area One\\") explaining that if he isn't picked up by his mother spaceship in three days, he'll die.  Of course, there are government agents that want to capture Starman--dead or alive.<br /><br />It is during this long journey to Landing Area One that we learn about Starman and the widow.<br /><br />What I found really interesting about this movie is how it blends sophisticated real-life events (such as SETI, Voyageur 2, and \\"Symbiotic Transformation\\" or cloning) into a funny, love story.  (SETI stands for the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence.  Voyageur 2 is a space probe that was launched from Earth in the late 1970s that has directions on-board of how to get to our planet.  It is still operational.)<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Starman.  And I could see why.  He does a magnificent job.  Karen Allen (hot off her success in the blockbuster \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\") also gives an excellent performance as the widow.<br /><br />The few special effects in this movie are well-done.  The background music adds to each scene.<br /><br />This movie spawned a short-lived television series.<br /><br />The executive producer for this movie was Michael Douglas.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2001 by Tristar) is excellent in sound and picture quality.  It has one extra.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an unforgettable science fiction movie!!<br /><br />(1984;  1 hr, 55 min;  widescreen/full screen;  28 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXfull screen;  28 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX

B00027JYLC|4.0|I saw this movie one night on TCM and I was astonished.  Uncomfortable at first because of the perceived exploitation of people with disabilities, but I moved past that into loving the movie for it's distinction of being different.  I have to agree with all of the other reviewers.  The sound quality is not very good for this movie.  TCM did a better job at remastering it to improve the ability to understand what several of the characters are saying.  I'm glad I have it, but at times even with the option for closed captioning, I still could not understand one of the characters.
B005JLNALG|5.0|I was very curous whether Road Salt Two was going to be the return to the classic POS prog / metal style, or more of Road Salt One.  I think I was about 30 seconds into song 2 (the first song is just a syphonic intro), and I realized, This is Road Salt One - Part 2.  Very similar production and style, so this is truely a sequal.    In a nut shell, I believe if you liked Road Salt One, you will like this album.  If you didn't like Road Salt One, then perhaps you will just have to hope and pray Daniel gets tired of this new style and makes a return to the old POS style on his next masterpiece.    In my opinion Road Salt 2 is a better album than the last, but still quite similar.  Still a very stark stipped down production, but as another reviewer mentioned, Daniel's vocals really pop out at you in the mix, amazingly clear and in your face.  It is also another tour de force in regard to lyrical content and Daniel's passionate vocal stylings. I personally love the retro 70's sound.  I absolutely love everything POS has done, and while I understnad and even agree with much of the criticism, I still love this album and can't wait to see what direction Daniel takes the band next.  As long as he doesn't go Opera, I'll still be a fan.  UPDATE:  I have now owned the CD for a couple of weeks and have listened to it probably 20 times, and I'm changing my review from 4 to 5 stars.  I think this CD is amazing, way better than Road Salt One.  I can't find a weak song on the CD.  I love the edgy vocals, the fuzzy tube overdrive guitar sound, the way the record flows.  I now disagree with any other reviewers complaints.  This CD is a masterpiece.
0143115014|5.0|I don't have much to add as far as the nature and content of \\"The Guide\\" is concerned.  It's snarky and cruel at times, subjective at best, and the book could use a better index.  And everyone who has an interest in perfume tends to know about it and has their opinion about it.  If you can stand the writing style it's a fun read, and at the very least a great way to familiarize yourself with the existence of many of the most well-know and not-so-well-known perfumes in commerce.    But perhaps it's greatest service to the world of perfume is the simple fact that The Guide *has* become as wildly controversial as it has. If it's message and opinions had been softer and tamer, would it have attracted the attention that it has ?  I doubt it.    As such it has served to incite the interest of many people who might otherwise never have imagined that something as apparently innocuous as perfume could serve to excite and inflame such levels of passion and controversy.     And like The Guide or hate it, a little controversy is always good for the sport.    :-)
B005HWAOCA|5.0|OK, don't want to overstate things but for me (teen in the 60-70's) firmly attached to middle age this is my #1 concert video.  If you were a Cream fan, or Rock & Roll fan from that time frame you will love this video.  Clear picture, great sound and as the boys said in the video something along to the \\"we are going to play everything we know\\" and all of the best of Cream definitely comes to the top.

B002DJSBMA|3.0|Imagine scenes where the actors speak in whispers and there is at the same time music playing. The music is loud enough where its impossible to clearly hear the dialog. This happens for MOST of the movie. Its a shame because the bits I could make out made for a good movie. This is the one and ONLY movie I have witnessed where this is occuring through out the movie. I am amazed that this was produced THIS way. Im sure the actors involved were furious with that result in the final product.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|I don't want to do another song-by-song review, so I will just give you my overral impression and feelings when I hear this album....<br /><br />A spectacular job by the Progressive Metal group, Dream Theater! Many questions on the life of D.T. after the exit of the Majestic Mike Portnoy have been answered by the Ambidextrous Mike Mangini! All the songs are strong on this album. Many stellar moments, but no weak points! All musicians are firing on all cylinders. Solid Bass playing, awesome keys, great guitar (John's best ever!), and James LaBrie shines like he did on Images and Words. His voice is as good as it was back then. Mangini ushers D.T. into their new era without any bumps-in-the-road. Smooth transition from Portnoy to Mangini. Very similar playing and style as Portnoy, but smoother. Not as in-your-face. I personally have always liked Mangini better than Portnoy (Mangini has been my favorite drummer for years).<br /><br />This album sounds like what the band TRIED to do in Images and Words, but succeedded and surpassed with ADTOE.<br /><br />Heavy, but less thrash-metal. More progressive Rock. Better guitar tone. Better bass-playing, better vocals, more meaningful keys, and better voice. and (oh boy, am I going to get flack for this). More musical drumming from the wonderful playing of Mangini.<br /><br />I really, really like this DT.
B005D51JQQ|3.0|All of the tracks on CD 1 have been remixed so they nothing like the original versions. I would have skipped this overpriced box set if I knew that. Good thing I have the remastered UK CDs of Sting's first three solo albums.
0062011847|3.0|I have read everything Discworld-related that Sir Terry Pratchett has written, many of them multiple times.  This book was incomprehensible to me.  The quality of the writing was so far below his last two novels that I ended up skimming... SKIMMING for the sake of Seven-Handed Sek!  Unheard of!<br /><br />The things that Pratchett does so excellently, such as using clear differences in linguistic style for different characters, using as few words as possible in dialogue, having consistent personalities, and a fresh take in each story are ALL missing here.<br /><br />Warning, may contain minor spoilers.<br /><br />First the characters.  Vimes has become verbose, which is unheard of, and uses phrases he would not be caught dead using in any other book.  In some ways, he seems to have picked up some of Carrot's personality as well.<br /><br />Willikins is unrecognizable.  Read him in Jingo and compare to this.  And he calls Vimes by at least a dozen different titles.<br /><br />Sybil likewise becomes less recognizable as the \\"Sybil we know\\".<br /><br />Then the problems with writing style.  I swear, there were Americanisms in there where they have not existed in prior novels.  Who wrote this?  Or was it just a very poor editing job?<br /><br />And now plot points.  As an example, Vimes meets former copper Jiminy at three different points in the book and each time Vimes seems to have reset the relationship completely resorting back to \\"I'm a copper, you're a copper, work with me here!\\"<br /><br />And the bad guy is a wimpy Carcer clone with almost a repeat of many plot elements there.  In addition to that, the man behind all the mayhem never even appears in the story except by reference.<br /><br />And seriously???  Now Vimes has special superpowers?!?  Honestly?  Oh but he won't use them, don't worry, because it just wouldn't be fair.  Can't trust 'em.  Geez guys, what happened to Vimes' internal watchman that Pratchett so eloquently described in Thud?<br /><br />Add to this the horrible formatting errors in the Kindle version (the worst I have EVER seen) and if I didn't know better I would say someone wrote a fraudulent version of a Pratchett novel and slipped it to Amazon when they weren't looking.  How did Harper let this out the door???<br /><br />All that said, the story itself has some great elements, and was very entertaining at times.  But I can't see how this was a Pratchett-written book, especially comparing the quality and writing style to his last three novels.I didn't know better I would say someone wrote a fraudulent version of a Pratchett novel and slipped it to Amazon when they weren't looking.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this and Ripped in 30. This video is less intense than the ripped in 30 but is by no means easy. You have to push through it and give it your all and you will lose weight. If you combine this with Jillians diet plan completely worth the money. It does not feel like your on a diet and you never feel hungry. The recipes are so delicious and it helps you stay healthy to have better weight loss results. I alternate this video with ripped in 30 to get a variation on exercise routines but you can not go wrong with either video. Thanks for a great 25 minute workout. You do need to warm up before you start the video since she doesn't take enough time to stretch and warm up.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|I preordered this item because I had my Kinect/TV setup in a smaller room with maybe 6 ft of space from edge to edge.  It was always tough to get my arms and feet in play as I am tall too.  So, I was excited abotu this item.   After hooking it up, my biggest gripe was that it would not respond to my hand movements.  Even when I was very close to the TV and swinging my hands wildly, it would not register.  So, I couldn't get the Xbox Dashboard to respond.  Continuing this issue, in games, it would not register my hand as not moving.  This made it impossible for me to select menu items because the counter would keep restarting thinking my hand had disappeared.  I wanted to love this but it did not work well at all.

B001QWBM62|4.0|I got this recorder and have it for like one year, I personally think is the best recorder that's affordable in the market. Of course you can find other recorder that has great quality, but they are slightly more expensive. The Zoom H4n does a great job, it can record up to 96kHz 24bits and has 2 XLR input (few portable audio recorders come with this feature). The on-board condenser microphones deliver great sound, for ambient use best. Don't expect this to record a dialog because that's not the correct use.   Now speaking of the cons, the only bad thing i found on this item is the battery cover, is a plastic piece, with two small hooks on it, i have already lost one because they are very fragile, if you don't pay attention and forget their existence when you try to put the battery cap on, you might break them, they are thin and tiny. That's the only bad design i found on this recorder.

B004L07KWQ|4.0|Pretty cool. I think my kids will enjoy this. Kind of confusing after you open this, but the blank black screen is the app. Just start swiping around to draw. And to the dummies that are asking for a clear all button, did you even read the description? It says shake to erase all, and then it asks you confirm so you can't accidentally erase everything.<br /><br />Update: I showed this to my 8 year old and taught him how to take pictures to draw on them and he loved it. He loves taking a picture of his sister and drawing silly faces on her. And many thanks to the star-burst effect guy, I showed him that and he loved it.

B004X4R49Y|5.0|To say this movie is no less than brilliant would be the greatest understatement ever made regarding a movie of this stature.  The direction, the acting and the movie making in general was first rate.  I love the fact the director did not find it necessary to clutter the movie with sweeping music or feel constant dialog was necessary.  For in the moments of silence we can feel King George VI pain and distress it gives an emotional connection with the characters.  The cast was perfect and the performance by all where amazing.  This is a praise I give to few films but I would put this on my list with Amedaus, Gandhi, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and there are others.    On a second note, this film gives a lot of self esteem building power to those who by no fault of their own suffer from speech impediments. Because one has difficulty with speech does not degrade their intelligence.    In a word this film was: BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now you can listen to the radio on an ipod but only local.  For some people that is no big deal but for sports fans etc, this can be pretty cool.  Like it!
1612930425|4.0|The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen intrigued me just by its mysterious title in which the two seemingly irrelevant words are put together. After I finished the first reading, I was impressed with her witty and sophisticated language that enlivened the characters with distinctive features and the descriptions of landscapes and atmospheres of that certain time period. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of this novel was the title itself- Pride and Prejudice. The two words do not agree upon a uniform theme but after the reading, I could make multiple links between the plots/themes of the novel and the title. The only aspect I did not really enjoy was how the basic structure of the entire essay was stereotypical and the plots being somewhat hackneyed to the readers who are exposed to a wide range of romance novels.<br /> Before I started the novel, I could not really expect in advance what would happen and how the characters would advance. However, as I finished up the novel, my curiosity was fully disentangled. Some readers may interpret the title as Darcy being the proud character and Elizabeth being the prejudiced character. However, from another perspective, one can also interpret the title as that both characters are prejudiced by their first impressions and their social classes and are blinded by their pride, which explains why they both continue to be put in a form of conflict. Either way, the title lets the readers expect something that they have never thought and thus turns the thing around after the reading, which maximizes the dramatic aspects of all.<br />Jane Austen's use of language is certainly highly sophisticated and classy especially when she describes the background scenes or setting of 18th century of England. Without watching movies, I could easily imagine each scene vividly. When she describes Longbourn, a typical country town, or Darcy's estate, it gave me right away an impression of what it was like during that epoch. Also, not only her picturesque and descriptive language, but her actualizations of the atmosphere of that certain era were directly conveyed to me that I once thought I was one of those daughters of Bennet family. She uses lots of details to offer the most explicit mood of realistic lives of an ordinary family in England and she successes regard to that.<br /> Austen's characters and perspectives are also some aspects that did captivate me a lot. The protagonists Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy stand out as very distinctive characters but minor charactors such as Jane, Bingley, Collins, Wickham, Lydia, Lady Catherine, and even her parents play tasteful roles that keep the novel stimulating until the end. The setting and background of this novel is something to focus on also because the lives of people in England during 18th-19th century were typical while the novel and plots deviate from such clich&eacute; by Austen making characters unique and distinguished. Elizabeth Bennet is unlike other women who were expected to be obedient and passive; Elizabeth seems vigorous in expressing her opinions, honest, straightforward and intelligent (and problematically she knows it too well). In a scene where Elizabeth confronts Lady Catherine, she does not fall back or cringes due to her lower class, but rather, she stands up defending herself and remain confident in saying what she wants to say to Lady Catherine. Her unique characteristic definitely explains why Darcy is so attracted to her in the first place.<br /> Austen integrates basic components of the lives of ordinary people naturally so that the readers today can easily compare their lives to that of old live and easily understand and even sympathize with the characters. She makes several conflicts between different class such as between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine or Ms. Bingley looking down on Jane to demonstrate how class distinction was so conspicuous during that time period. Also, the typical mindsets of women are displayed when Mrs. Bennet is very desperate to let all her five children be married to rich men or when Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte marries to Mr. Collins even without love. It was a prevalent thought back then that love is not the most chief determinant in marriage (This is why Elizabeth-Darcy relationship is more enthralling). The readers today can easily perceive what it was like in England by reading the novel and place themselves in the middle of the setting. Nonetheless, along with this, it was also an intriguing component that Austen used four different couples to demonstrate that diverse situations allowing the readers to compare.<br /> Except the fact that the basic structure of the novel was formulaic, I enjoyed the novel and I would like to recommend to those of my age because anyone of my age could easily relate to Elizabeth and be easily impressed by her attractive characteristics and eye-catching development of Elizabeth and Darcy's beautiful relationships.
0811876373|5.0|When I was little, I used to pour over my mum's cake books constantly.  I loved the children's cake designs - the colors, the characters and the amazing imaginative ideas they had.    When I picked up this book in my local cake supplies store - I was right back there - I was 5 years old again!  There are so many great projects to try.  And such a range of imaginative ideas.  I am not artistically gifted.  In fact, I'd go so far to say as I am creatively-challenged - but these are surprisingly easy even though they look so complicated.  Don't get me wrong, it does take a while - especially if you have 48 cake pops to decorate individually.  But the best part that I discovered, was that if a couple \\"accidentally\\" go a bit wrong, you can just a have a little nibble on any rejects as you go onto the next! They still taste amazing and my family were surprisingly helpful in clearing up the imperfect ones.  Thanks Bakerella!
1609611543|4.0|In Wheat Belly, Dr. William Davis emphasizes wheat's role in obesity, which is an excellent means of marketing the message. People don't like being fat. The book begins with a review of how wheat has been hybridized and genetically modified from its earlier, natural state and that this modification has increased certain compounds in the wheat that lead to diabetes and weight gain.   Davis goes on to explain the many hazards of a diet containing wheat:  * Exorphins in wheat are addictive causing us to eat more.  * Wheat's unique carbohydrate amylopectin A causes an excessive rise in blood sugar leading to fat deposition, particularly inflammatory visceral fat.   * Gluten causes celiac disease and gluten intolerance manifesting as many chronic ailments.  * Wheat is the predominant cause of insulin resistance and diabetes.  * A diet high in grains such as wheat adds to the acid load of the body.  * High blood sugar caused by wheat causes formation of advanced glycation end (AGE) products leading to cataracts, wrinkles, and hardened arteries.  * Carbohydrates, particularly wheat, cause the release of insulin that triggers synthesis of small LDL particles, the kind that cause heart disease.  * Immune response to gluten causes damage to the brain and nerves resulting in ataxia, encephalopathy, dementia, neuropathy, seizers, etc.  The book concludes with guidance on eliminating wheat from your diet, potential withdrawal symptoms, simple nutritional guidelines for replacing wheat, hidden sources of wheat, a sample 7-day diet plan and a few recipes.   The only serious issue I have with the book is that Davis places too much emphasis on the glycemic effect of wheat vs. sugar. He writes: \\"Aside from some extra fiber, eating two slices of whole wheat bread is really little different, and often worse, than drinking a can of sugar-sweetened soda or eating a sugary candy bar...The GI of a Snickers bar is 41--far better than whole grain bread.\\"   The majority of glucose from wheatis distributed in the blood and taken up by most of the cells for energy, the rest going to the liver. But all fructose (which comprises half of sugar and typically 55% of HFCS) goes to the liver to be metabolized. So it's true that sugar does not cause as great a rise in blood sugar, but metabolism of its fructose component creates more VLDL, triglycerides and AGEs than glucose (not to mention uric acid) and has been implicated as the cause of insulin resistance, weight gain and hypertension. Considering that many wheat products contain sugar, eliminating wheat also eliminates much sugar.   I believe wheat is terribly destructive to the health of some people, but blaming wheat and implicating all carbohydrates as central to obesity and diabetes is mistaken. Aside from that, and a tendency toward hyperbole, Wheat Belly is a good introduction to the physical damage that wheat can cause, and it is written such that anyone can understand the issues. Wheat made me very sick, and I'm grateful to people like Dr. Davis who are informing the public of its dangers.

B005DZMODI|4.0|This CD took getting used to.  For one thing, I first played it in my car and I thought it was damaged.  Turns out when I put it in my regular CD player the skipping stopped.  I did not have to return it.  Now I have come to really enjoy this album.  \\"Ice Dream\\" is a blast!  What's not to love with these two artists?  However, I was sorely disappointed in their version of \\"Layla\\", which is one of my favorite classic Clapton pieces.  It sounds like a dirge.  The original had that interesting mix of negative key and then an upbeat switch, which I always found very sensual.  Oh well, this current version is just a blues interpretation.

0307719774|5.0|I really love this journal and I am excited to write in it every day! I make myself wait to read the next days questions, it's much more fun not knowing! I have kept journals since I was a child, and rereading years later was always one of my favorite things to do, so this is perfect for me so I can see how I and my life have changed from year to year. Quite small, I do like the simple brown cover, but I agree with everyone else that it needs a ribbon book mark!! I placed my own ribbon in it, and it works just fine. I plan on getting a few for Christmas presents this year!
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|Just got my order and put it to the test.  It passed with flying colors.  It's great to hear Echos in bitmapped 24 bits.  I am an audio perfectionist and a poor mix or master bugs me to all ends. I loved what I heard with Meddle.  Echos is one of my 5 favorite psychedelic songs.  I'm a fan of the remaster.  I also bought Animals and am happy with it also.  If you love your audio as much as I do, this is a must.  I do have a 1972 copy but like my 24bitmapped CD's.  Echo's is a must have song.  I believe it is Pink Floyd at their best.  Beautiful Jewel.

1423399994|5.0|It's rare, really rare to me, for a book to actually be improved by it's audio version.  This is such a book.  It's an excellent story, set on Orcas Island (a real one), about a woman who's rebuilt her life after tragedy.  As an obedience dog trainer, there's already room for humor and Roberts made good use of that, but the characters have their moments, too.  The reader of the audiobook version, Tanya Eby, made so much more of the book it's almost like reading something new.  You feel the emotions of the people involved in the canine search and rescue group that the heroine is part of, the searchers as well as subjects involved.  I laughed out loud at some of the dog training exercises, especially involving Simon - who is trying to become the youngest curmudgeon in existence - and his puppy, Jaws.  Eby has a great range of voices and uses them well in this story - don't miss it!

0061433063|5.0|The fourth book in the ongoing tale of Tiffany Aching is darker than the first three, but the same  wisdom, cleverness and charm comes through.  Reading the book I was struck with the idea that this would be the end of the Aching novels, and some things at the end of the book (no spoilers!) seem to confirm that. Even so, the book is wonderful. There is always more than meets the eyeand Sir Terry delivers full value for your money.  Read the first three books (The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, Wintersmith) and you will love the last (or perhaps latest) in the series.  Good stuff.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|This is a good basic paint program that is entertaining for younger kids, slightly older kids would probably want something more sophisticated with more options.  This is a good 10 minute time killer app for your kids at a restaurant or wherever you need to keep them occupied for a while. the shake to clear feature is one of the better design elements for kid use too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I purchased this, I did not realize that it was young adult.  Don't let that stop you!  As an avid reader of classic literature, I still loved this book.  I ended up with the whole trilogy.  There actually is a story - so rare for books that come out these days!  I ended up getting wrapped up in the teenage drama, yet there were plenty of \\"adult\\" issues.  I think almost anyone age 10 - 100 would enjoy this (I'm in my 30's).
B0002KZAKS|4.0|I used this microphone last night at a DJ show I did in town.  I usually use a Shure SM58 and have had no problems in the past, but I was looking for something new for a more affordable price.  This mic feels and looks great, but the sounds is a little off.  If I left my EQ settings at dead center, the mic was wayyyyy too bassy and boomy.  I had to adjust my Low to about 9/10 o clock, my Mid to about 3 o clock, and my High to about 2 30.  After that, the mic sounded basically JUST like the SM58.  Very crisp, very clear, and no feedback or other distortion the whole night.  All in all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  I'm not going to be using the mic without a mixer ever, so it's not a huge deal that the sound needs to be tweaked like it was.
B000JQV68A|5.0|This was a great book that highlighted the classic character development that Fitzgerald is so popular for.  I hated some of the main characters, which for me is a positive, because they made me feel something.  Nice story with lots of sub-plots.  Great, but frustrating ending!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good for those who like mental challenges without time constraints. Not overally complex, but some levels really make ypu stop and think. Fun for adults, and my 12 year old loves it too.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This is real entertainment.  You have debauchery, murder, a love story that isn't really one, a main character that you both like and hate, and some kind of supernatural thing going on (usually not my cup of tea, but this case is the exception of the rule.) The best part of the book was that I kept wanting to know what happened next, and there were enough twists and turns to be interesting, yet still believable.  I highly recommend this!

B001N18HMS|5.0|Initially, I was more impressed with John's description of this album than with the music itself.  I found the the rhythms uninteresting, and his voice slightly difficult to get behind.  But, something about the end of Unreachable drew me in, the amazing mounting feeling at the end with the guitar harmonies was an epic moment I kept re-listening to.  And that drew me in to listening and accepting his vocal and the parameters of the album a bit more.  In some ways the music is extremely classic, in others it's quite experimental and daring, and there are some extremely honest and startling juxtapositions - it reminds me a bit of a Jack Bruce album for some reason.  Overall I'm left with a feeling of gratitude for this album- it's exceptionally honest, it's extremely ambitious and passionate, and written to appeal to universal themes as a way of reaching out with the heart rather than to 'strike a chord' with people.  I'm very glad I put some extra effort into listening to it.  John Frusciante appeals to me as an artist who keeps working and developing and he seems to view rock and roll music as something to develop over a lifetime rather than just maintain a state of preserved adolescence.  Gets better on every listen.
B0034G4P80|4.0|It is an awesome DVD to purchase. Perfect quality a good amount of bonus features. I just wish there were more deleted scenes, or a gag reel because that would be funny.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|In the spirit of full disclosure, I love this novel, so of course no movie adaptation would ever make me completely happy. But I think I can offer some perspective.<br /><br />If you've never read Jane Eyre, then you'll find this movie to be a pleasant period costume drama, with a splendid stately home setting. However, the first thirty minutes of flashbacks will surely be confusing, since so much of Jane Eyre's youth is compressed here. As the movie settles into the love affair with Mr. Rochester, it begins to make more sense. If you don't plan on reading the novel (a pity), a quick perusal of a plot summary would surely be of help in fleshing out the missing parts before you settle in with the DVD.<br /><br />If you read the novel a long time ago, the movie may whet your appetite for the real thing. It will conjure up scenes you thought you'd forgotten. And take it from me, the novel is best enjoyed the second or third time, particularly if you read it--or were forced to read it-- when you were too young. In this sense, the left-out parts, particularly Jane's life at Lowood School, may lead you straight back to the book. Who could argue with that?<br /><br />And if Jane Eyre is a novel that is a favorite of yours, you'll find this film a decent one with which to while away a couple of hours. All the time you'll be thinking about how you'd really like to pick up the novel yet again to fill in all the places---the many many many places--the movie never mentions.<br /><br />M. Feldman
B000RZOR2U|2.0|Here in Australia, if one sees a red-bellied black snake, a blue-ringed octopus or a black tiger snake, discretion becomes the better part of valour and it is time to retreat.<br /><br />Similarly back in the Eighties and Nineties Teldec issued this entire Harnoncourt / Leonhardt cycle in a \\"chocolate\\" brown colour (as we will call it). While the current proprietors have wised up and changed the schemata it is all too late. The secret is out.<br /><br />These performances are rougher than a dog's guts - or its output. Here, Harnoncourt is at his most intractable and wayward. Gustav Leonhardt, an austere figure, oversees many of the cantatas. The Dutch of course are famous for being so happy-go-lucky . . . . . Neither conductor makes any concession whatsoever to current day performance-practice: it is as vinegary as they come.<br /><br />And sad to say, many of these grim-faced performances bring to mind a sausage factory: one wonders how much rehearsal time was allocated to some of them. The singing, particularly of the boy soloists, ranges from passable to execrable. Perhaps the roughness mirrors what Bach had to endure at St Thomas' but was there any real need to replicate it?<br /><br />The cycle has been utterly superseded by the Suzuki survey on BIS. It served its day. Night has fallen.
B004WKOCP8|1.0|I have listened to Incubus from their humble beginnings of \\"The Fungus Among Us.\\"  I have all of their cds but waited awhile to get this one as I didn't like the first single that was released to the radio.  That was a good indicator of the album and I should not have even taken the time to listen to it.  As I listened to the first three tracks, I asked myself if Incubus changed styles and I missed out on the memo.  Seriously I felt as if I was listening to the John Tesch easy listening hour.  The songs were slow and the singing was disasterous.  Brandon sings slow, almost lethargically on the album.  His words seem drawn out almost meant to fit the music in the background instead of singing his heart out as he once did.  There is not the powerful edge that Incubus once had.  The album lacks their heavier rock roots; in fact I'm not sure I would consider any of these songs much more than soft rock.  I hope this is not the end of a once great rock band because this album would be a disappointing end to a great string of albums.
B005GVW05Q|2.0|What happened to the rabble rouser Ryan Adams??? Remember \\"Gold\\", \\"Rock 'n Roll\\", \\"Love Is Hell\\", & \\"Cold Roses\\"?

I don't care if you wanna go rock or country, just wake the heck up, man! SNAP OUT OF IT ALREADY!   Yaaaawwwwwwn! I gotta go get a high-test coffee now to wake up after listening to this cd.

B005HPA2XI|5.0|I loved CRACK THE SKYE bc Mastodon FINALLY stopped screaming and began SINGING. This cd continues their upward trend. I admit I was worried when I heard the songs would be shorter but my worries were completely unfounded. They've made another fantastic record that totally kicks a$$! I had hoped the DVD would be at least the whole album with the trippy imagery like they did with the bonus disc of the live CTS set last time. Sadly, that is not the case. DVD only has 2 music videos... 1 of which has muppet-like creatures literally destroying each other hysterically... and an interview of the drummer talking about the songs. While it's good to know what the songs are about according to him, it's not something I will watch again. So over all, music good; video meh.

B0013JG7IQ|4.0|The Magic Flute  La Flûte enchant&eacute;e  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Spain ] is Kenneth Branagh's 2006 adaptation of Mozart's Magic Flute. First, it is a cardinal sin to change the language of an opera. The production is stunning though. Amazing picture. Great costuming and Branagh truly understands the nature of Mozart. I would have given it 5 stars if he had kept the language to the original German as it sounds more genuine. Still an amazing opera/movie experience that should not be missed. The singers on the whole do a very good job. Recommended. 4/5.

B000RO8T7K|5.0|What is it that makes a great performance great? The greatness is in the details. It's the small things that make the difference. There is something about this performance of Bach's tender, exquisite sonatas for violin and harpsichord that makes it really special and a par above the rest. Bach's sonatas for violin and harpsichord are one of my favourite works by this composer, and while I've heard a few performances that really caught my ear, this one is out of this world. Frank Peter Zimmermann is a great violinist, I knew that the instant I heard him perform the Sibelius concerto some 10 or 20 years ago. But listening to this was a surprise. Enrico Pace is a fascinating pianist, too and the duo seem to work really well together.   Not to be missed!

My nephew will find it silly, I'm sure.. Since I colored all over him! The screen was black for me as well when I started it, so I thought it wasn't going to work.. But that was just the background color it started me with. All the other comments kind of had me worried when I saw it!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|When I was a little girl I learn all the lines and songs in the movie. I can remember watching it over and over again. Unfortunately my V.H.S was shortly worn out.Now that I have children of my own I bought the blu-ray disc and is now one of my little girls favorite movie to watch with mommy..
B0058VW36U|5.0|This, in my opinion, is what mobile gaming should be! Short, addicting experiences that are enjoyable as well. This hits the nail on the head!!! A fantastic little game.
B005GNIX32|2.0|This book is a quick read, most of it at a fairly low level technically (to an engineer). The first part of the book is 'science is cool' kind of stuff (rainbows, straws, magnets, etc), but Dr. Lewin, drawing from his long experience lecturing at MIT, does it with some flare and more depth than you normally would see. I took beginning physics at MIT before Dr. Lewin and remember some of the same experiments he describes, like the swinging ball to the chin, being done. I don't remember my physic professor riding a pendulum ball (cover picture), but interesting physics demonstrations have long been a feature of freshman physics at MIT.    The latter part of the book I think is the more interesting. Here he tells us about his professional work and interests outside the classroom. Dr Lewin was a pioneer and expert in the field of x-ray astronomy. He gives us an insider's view of how x-ray astronomy developed, tells personal stories about the launching huge helium balloons, we lean a little about how x-ray telescopes work. (I wish there had been more detail here, maybe an appendix on x-ray telescopes.) Near the end of the book we learn Dr. Lewin has another side as he tells us of his long and intense interest in art, that he owns far more art books than physics books, and has been a technical consultant to artists over the years.  I don't want to be unkind about the structure of this book, but it is pretty loose, a collection of unrelated topics. In the middle of a 'science is cool' chapter we suddenly find ourselves in remembrances of Dr. Lewin's childhood in Nazi occupied Holland.  A factor may be Dr. Lewin's health, he tells us he recently spent a long time in the hospital. It is unclear how much of this book was written by Dr. Lewin, and how much was 'told to' a non-technical (\\"my immersion in a foreign world\\") writer his literary agent got to help him.
B005DZMODI|4.0|Clapton appears here as just one more pal in an extraordinary band which makes delightful covers of the best New Orleans jazz themes.  It's also well worth an accurate listening of the Layla cover.  But most of all, it is much better to enjoy it in dvd, since you can feel the magic of the show.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I am a reluctant fan of American Idol.  I picked Scotty for the win early on, based mostly on his voice which I think is quite exceptional.  Now that he has come out with his first CD, I am officially a Scotty McCreery fan.  Much has been made of the simultaneous releases of Scotty's and Lauren Alaina's CDs.  Scotty is wholesome.  Lauren is kind of a bad girl.  In my opinion Lauren is a stereotype - I have no interest in hearing her CD.  Scotty is a guy who sings about loving his family and his small town and kissing girls behind the bleachers, and I believe him.  Maybe that's not the kind of person he really is, but it's the kind of person who comes through in his music, and the music really grabs me.  His voice is amazing, the song choice is excellent.  I love this CD, and I look forward to more.  In my opinion, it is the best first CD from an AI contestant.  Highly recommended.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I saw this film in a suburban \\"art house.\\"  It had been out for a little while, and the mixed reviews had already been circulating, so I was pleasantly surprised the theater was nearly packed.  A few people walked out.  That's OK.  The film is not everyone's cup of tea.  Personally, I was mesmerized.  Malick has achieved the nearly impossible: Expressed a moment of epiphany in something as linear as a film.  Anyone looking for a typical story arc or narrative will be disappointed.  Approach the film as you would a piece of music -- or better yet, a painting -- and let the impressions wash over you and let them in.
1612930425|3.0|In the book Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen the story circles around the whole idea of marriage, and reputation. Everyone in the novel wants to find love, and marry someone. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her five daughters to find husbands and she makes it \\"The business of her life\\" (Austen, pg 5) to get her daughters married. Throughout the novel the characters must cope with the issues of pride and wealth in their community and in turn deal with the pressures of marrying into a good family.<br />Mr. Bingley, who is a wealthy man, is very attracted to Jane, the eldest daughter. They dance at the ball and she believes that he is the right man for her. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's friend, does not want to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, because she isn't part of the same social class as Mr. Darcy. This makes him seem very arrogant. However, as the novel progresses Mr. Darcy sets aside his prejudice, and actually starts to fall for Elizabeth. Elizabeth starts to realize that she actually has feelings for Mr. Darcy. She understands that she isn't as rich as Mr. Darcy, and that she does not come from the same world as him. Elizabeth looks past the arrogance she once saw in Mr. Darcy, and learns to love him regardless.<br />Elizabeth's younger sister elopes with Officer Wickham, and the family is ashamed. Elizabeth fears that their pride may be ruined. Even though the two are happy together the family acts callously towards the couple because they do not think that Wickham is good enough for her, and she would be better off with someone from a high social class.<br /> Jane and Mr. Bingley get engaged and everyone is happy again. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth about Mr. Darcy's intentions on marrying her, and that she should say no. Lady Catherine does not think that Elizabeth is worthy of her nephew because he is so wealthy, and she is just average. Elizabeth says that she isn't going to throw away her happiness, and accepts when Mr. Darcy proposes.<br /> The book was very well written but the plot was a little boring and goes back and forth too much. I felt that all anyone really cared about was whether or not they were going to get married. I thought that the way the characters spoke, and how the actual words were written were very eloquent, and made a simple phrase sound beautiful.  I feel like what the author was saying could have been said in fewer words, and she could have condensed it into a shorter novel.<br /> I also liked how Elizabeth didn't give into Mr. Darcy right away and she stood her ground, yet Mr. Darcy did not give up on Elizabeth. She thought that he was very arrogant but then once she got to know him she actually appreciated him.<br /> Because the book focuses mainly on the subject of marriage, and love, only certain people may find enjoyment and entertainment in it. I don't believe that this novel was written for one specific age group, and could be read by many different ages. I think that young adults might enjoy the novel the best, because it deals with finding love. Again, the book was very well written, but a little too repetitive.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Rediculously overpriced. Apple is a scam company with everthing overpriced, and they force you to use there software for everything.I'm sorry about Steve but the company as a whole is a monopoly.
0783229526|5.0|Most brick and mortar stores do not carry this movie any more.  Was glad to find it at such a great price on Amazon.  Very fast delivery.  item was as described.  thank you very much.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|my son loves this app it keeps him busy while I'm running around, the things that he draw are so awesome.
6303942830|5.0|Great movie. The last ten minutes is total choreography, stirring music and action that one just does not see. I am concerned that the theatrical release I got in VHS will be available in DVD
B005D9MUWY|5.0|got this for free a few months ago as the paid app of the Day.  it really sped up my typing.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Pretty awesome app, works great!   Very simple, perfect for small kids just learning how to use technology. I got this simply because I look forward to playing with this with my 3 mo old when she gets a little older.   Now to the obvious stuff. It's a paint program for kids. So when the app loads, as it says in description, it presents a blank black canvas. So when you see the banner and the screen goes blank, it's waiting for you to use it.   Also as the description says, the back key works as an undo, so when you see this black canvas and freak out about the app not working and start mashing the back arrow (why would you hit the back arrow anyway?), it won't do anything, cuz you haven't drawn anything.   Again, as the description says, when your ready to start over, shake the phone.   Really getting tired of these boneheads giving bad reviews because they won't read an apps description before downloading it.
B005ELQVGW|4.0|My first listen through Biophilia made me want to go back into it and really study it. What attracted me about this album was the balance of silence and sound that was played out very well. The timbres are unique and inventive and give a real depth do the tracks. The album is not, however, without fault. Dark Matter and Hollow really didn't do anything to develop the flow that the first side had already accomplished and stop the journey in its tracks. Sacrifice and Mutual core were, by far, the most successful tracks and will probably be the two favorites off of this album. The other tracks are also successful in bringing unique sounds and textures to the music and make Biophilia feel like a true album. Overall I felt it was successful and, most of all, it is a fun album to listen to that deserves attention.
0385344325|3.0|The latest Reacher, The Affair, was as usual, long awaited. But this one is disappointing. It may be that Child is getting tired of his one-character series, but the plot really didn't hang together. Not when the reader goes back over the red herrings and the misdirections by the author. Besides that, all the previous books state that Reacher left the military voluntarily because he saw no future in staying. This book contradicts that and implies he was forced out by the higher-ups. A small detail, maybe, but to loyal readers who keep track of these things, an error. The sex scenes are really pretty gratuitous and laughable. Made me think that Child was told to get more sex into his stories simply to attract readers. I don't object to Reacher's affairs (pardon the pun), but these scenes are really over the top, to the point where I laughed out loud. C'mon Jack! Just once I'd like him to meet a less than spectacular woman with the requisite tiny waist, long hair and endless legs. How about a perky, slightly chubby redhead for a change?!
B004L07KWQ|5.0|I am posting this review only because some guy gave it a low score because his son threw his phone in the toilet. perhaps if there was a bug in the app that told his son to toss the phone into the porcelain palace, I could then see the relevance in rating the app 2 stars. The ratings system is for your opinion on how the app performs not how your son misbehaves....idiot.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I own all the Allman albums, Tedeschi and Trucks.<br />Allman is Allman of course.<br />Trucks is the new Allman band and the closest great stuff to Gregg Allman and Allman Brothers.<br />Trucks was not close to create the great Allman blend until he joined force with Tedeschi.<br />The music is very ALlman with a personal touch from both artist. My advise to the readers; buy this album if you are into the music of any of 3 artists mentioned in this review.<br />My advise to Tedeschi and Trucks; In love, dating or just a professional joined force, don't ever separate because this is your best album ever.<br />The nicest tracks are: Midnight in Harlem, Until you remember, These Walls, Learn how to love<br />Keep up the good work
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Just as advertised. Small, unobstrusive, works very well, may not have 20 hours of talk time but still charges fast and works well.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Just what I was hoping for from the description. A silly, lighthearted finger painting program where you can dress up your photos or just good off. Plus, no questionable permissions.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I originally purchased this stroller accessory for a light weight stroller, but ended up using it for my high end jogging stroller. It works ok on the light weight stroller but fits the larger jogging stroller better. I was glad to have had ordered this at such a low price versus the name brand stroller accessory ranging between $25-$30. I love that you can fit sports bottles and baby bottles alike in the two beverage compartments, and appreciate the small zipper in the main compartment  you can keep keys, ID's and even a slim phone safely secure). Overall this a great product at an affordable price.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|For less than $30 it works great if you need something to go from either optical or coax to unbalance inputs. Great simple dac product for the price.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee's book is many things: heartbreaking, heartwarming, inspirational and a compelling read. I am amazed by this young woman's strength and character after everything she has had to endure for 18 years at the hands of a convicted sex offender and his no-good wife.<br /><br />I am heartbroken that Jaycee's childhood was stolen at 11 and she had to live in such horrendous conditions. It is heartwarming that Jaycee came out if this a kind and compassionate person who wants to help others who have endured similar circumstances as she. Her memoir is an inspiration to many who have lived horrible lives because look at how she is today. She survived and will not be called a victim. It is truly wonderful that Jaycee has become her own person and wants to do great things with her life. Way to go, Jaycee!<br /><br />Her book is a compelling read in many ways: Jaycee tells of her experiences in her own words and in her own way as she remembers them. Jaycee has a gift for writing as is shown in her well-written book.<br /><br />Jaycee tells of what Phillip and Nancy did to her, but never bad mouths them or expresses hostility toward them. She would have every right to be angry about her lost childhood, but she has forgiven them.<br /><br />I wish Jaycee and her daughters only the best! She is a wonderful mother and cared for her girls under the worst of circumstances.
0439023513|5.0|This book was a great way to wrap up the Hunger Games series.  The price was right and I received the book very quickly.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I loved the first book in the series and was intrigued by the second, but the final book was just predictable. It lacked enough development to make me curious or intrigued and half way through I realized I was no longer reading for enjoyment, but just to get it finished.
B00338QENI|5.0|Henrietta Lacks would fit extremely well in an historical series featuring unsung heroes. This quiet, determined black heroine lived a rather ordinary life in the '40s and early '50s until dying from a particularly vicious form of cervical cancer. Her treating physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital removed a small sample of her cervix for study. Today, it is illegal to remove tissue from a person without their consent. In the early '50s it was completely legal and within the normal standard of practice in academic medicine.<br /><br />It is remarkable that Henrietta's cells (code named HeLa) continue thriving today. They are among the most prolific genetic material the world has ever known. HeLa is in space. HeLa is on every continent. HeLa has been used to cure and treat dozens of life-threatening diseases. The moral issue is twofold: (1) Henrietta had no knowledge that her cells would be used (2) Henrietta and her family never profited a single cent while corporations made millions from the products of research on her cells.<br /><br />Half of Rebecca Sloot's narrative covers the short life of Henrietta Lacks. Much is unknown. Her children were young when she died. Other relatives forgot about her. Her husband remained bitter until the end that doctors never explained her cells were still alive and in use.<br /><br />The writing of [[ASIN:B00338QENI The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]] is first-rate. The portrayal of the Lacks children and grandchildren struggling in Baltimore, Maryland is moving. The typical struggles of the urban poor are all there: gang violence, drug abuse, lack of educational opportunities. Imagine fair compensation from the scientific community and pharmaceutical companies--each descendant of Henrietta might get free health care at the medical institution of their choice. Readers can expect to come away extremely impressed with both Lacks and her storyteller Ms. Sloot--the reporter who spent years researching a tale that truly is stranger than fiction.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really liked the book. I think it is well written and consistant with the other 4 books. If you enjoyed the other books you should enjoy this one also.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Very happy with the GPS receiver works and performs. Better than the hand held type and works great with streets and trips 2011
0446571415|1.0|I've read and enjoyed all the other Camel Club books. They are fun stories because of the interaction of each different CC member. They all work well together with Oliver as their leader. Since Oliver was basically the only one involved in this story it was tedious, repititious, and just plain boring! I could barely finish it.  Oliver's constant hand-wringing got so old - \\"Oh, my friends are hurt and it's all my fault!\\" \\"I've got a badge, no I don't, yes I do...\\" Give me a break! David Baldacci - you ruined a great franchise.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I just started watching Castle this summer and had to buy all the seasons. I absolutely love the show. I think the chemistry between Stana (Kate) and Nathon (Castle) Is just amazing. It seems so natural. Every episode grabs me and always has me thinking. I just love the show. I would recommend it to anyone who loves drama, romance, suspence and much more.
B005JU5JTI|3.0|Reading all the reviews on here seem to put a very negative view on the movie. I do think it was slow at times and the ending becomes predictable a bit as the movie progresses. Cameron Diaz did a nice job in the funny scenes. Its just too bad there weren't enough of them. Best Cameron movie I have seen in a long time. Would recommend watching if in the bargain bin or on cable, but not full price.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|I think the only thing that could make this app better is a screen lock. That way my 3 year old can doodle but can't get into everything else. Good job :-)
B003ZTQN1I|1.0|The movie was great. Liked all of the songs. However when you get the sound track guess what? Some songs on the sound track are not sung by the same artist as in the movie. Very dissapointed. When seeing a movie you expect the sound track that you liked when seeing the movie. The movie is what drives the sound track purchase. Lucky I gave it one star.
B005BCE7II|5.0|This movie is good but in 3D it is even better. If you have a 3D TV what better way to enjoy it than with a 3D movie.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|You ever want to reach into the screen and punch someone lights out, batemen was tolerable, the other two and the verbage, typical today, constant cursing and base language, where the hell is my refund for this pile of poop.  Didn't laugh once, was just frustrated and didn't finish the film.
1440503257|5.0|I love this cookbook.  It has a lot of British Recipes in it and it tells you from which Harry Potter book (chapter and section) that food was mentioned.  I made the Yorkshire Pudding in it once and became addicted so it is now something I regularly make.  While there are a lot of desserts featured in the book, other things like foods mentioned in Hogwarts great feast are also listed as well as some very traditional ones that would be expected to served in the Wesley house.  Everything I have made from the book has been great although I there are a few ones that I don't ever seeing me make, but that is the way with any cookbook.  If you are a Harry Potter fan or your kid is, this is a great way to experience another side of it.  Make a Harry Potter meal to eat while you watch the DVDs.
B00447L4KA|5.0|I like the character Julia styels plays in this. She was a strong willed girl who didn't care about popularity. I wish there were more real girls like her that could do there own thing instead of the popular thing.
0920668372|5.0|This is the most awesome book and it is so touching everytime we read it.  There is a little saying that the mother says in the book to the little boy that is so sweet.  My children know all the parts of the book that it comes in and they say it with me.  This is my favorate book to read to my children and they beg me to read it over and over.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|I don't have children yet but downloaded it because I'm hoping to have some soon.   I can see my kids playing with this app, it's easy to use, not too complicated for kids since colors change randomly so there's not configuration to be done. For now my niece is the one playing it and she loves it.   Don't expect it to be like photoshop, it's name says it all it's just a paint for kids!  A must have if you have children.
1612130283|5.0|This book was Awesome!...I couldn't put it down...   If you are not familiar with E.L James or the Fifty Shades of Grey series...you are really missing out on a fantastic story, written by an exceptionally gifted writer. She has a fabulous,realistic, multi-layered main character and a host of complementary characters, flowing story lines, wonderful plot development...and she has detailed scenes that you can picture vividly all while in the confines of your home. Having read her fan fiction story....let me tell you that Fifty Shades is definitely more than fifty shades of HOT!HOT!HOT! Book 2 Fifty Shades Darker was published on Sept 15 and is as hot as Fifty Shades of Grey.  This is definitely a MUST READ if you are over 18. I guarantee that you will re read it over and over.
0385523912|5.0|This book is incredibly well-written with an intelligent, perceptive voice guiding the reader throughout. It's almost novel-like in its storytelling, including:   * A girl in kindergarten faking wild sobbing on the death of the country's dictator for fear of being seen as unpatriotic  * The often mentioned story of the doctor stumbling into a village and realizing 'dogs in China eat better than doctors in North Korea'... incredible to believe but true  * Doctor's eyewitness accounts of stages of starvation at a district hospital and being unable to do anything about it; beer bottles substituting for IV pouches  * Family ties breaking down: a father giving away his sons to an orphanage, a wife watching her husband and children waste away... tragic  * As things grew worse and people could be less careful, a man breaks a 40-year silence on his past to sing an incredibly simple, innocent S. Korean song from his childhood  * Luxurious items include: American-made nail clipper with \\"clean, sharp edges\\", ball point pen, jackets with zippers  * A doctor hears a woman whose husband and child had starved to death saying, \\"I'm better off... fewer mouths to feed,\\" and unable to decide whether the woman was callous or insane  * The incredible corruption, entrapment, racism, and classism at every level of society.  And an oddly very foxy prostitute.   I wish, however, that the journalist covered more hard numbers: a more detailed history of the two states, the reactions of the outside world, comparisons of different economies and actions by top officials, to give a more nuanced and full view of this period.
1612130585|5.0|WOW!!!This is Fifty Shades of Awesome!  I am totally bewitched by this story, Fifty Shades Darker(part 2 of the Fifty Shades series) follows the relationship of Christian Grey(Fifty Shades)and Anastasia Steele as they both deal with what they want and need from their relationship while dealing with the raw sexual tension they feel. They both have a long way to go but E.L.James did an awesome job in bringing Christian to another level by slowly making him deal with the darker side of himself and his fifty shades of depravity. The story flows seamlessly from scene to scene as it pulls you more and more into the story. This book is Hot with lots of sexual tension, you'll worry about the characters, wanna cry when they cry, feel angry or frustrated when they do, laugh at some of the dialogue and then cry happy tears all in just a few pages but I guarantee that you will not be able to put it down. It is so fantastic you will feel the need to read it again.  Fifty Shades Darker is every bit as Awesome! as Fifty Shades of Grey was.   It is still Fifty Shades of HOT!HOT!HOT!
B004UID2LC|2.0|This app used to be 5 stars all the way, but after the last update it won't download a thing! It gets to 99% then disappears! I am frustrated that the developer doesn't say what is being updated, but I can always tell when it needs to be updated because my download speed goes to crap or it refuses to download anything. Only this time it happened AFTER I updated! What do I do now? This update really was awful.
0545123275|4.0|What I liked: 1) Different myths. I liked that Miz Stiefvater ignored the usual myths about werewolves (the silver bullets, the full moon) and created something unique. Sam and the rest of the pack change into wolves when the temperature changes. This really had a huge impact on the entire story. The temperature was even listed at the start of each chapter (which was a nice addition!) 2) Sam and Grace. They had a very...Bella and Edward-esque romance about them. In the way they moved around each other, and the way they read each other. It was a very...uplifting kind of love. Makes you feel good just reading about it. 3) Focus. This is something that I don't comment on a lot, but this book was very focused. It wasn't going off in a lot of different directions, so the storyline flowed clearly and cleanly. 4) Descriptions. Miz Stiefvater has a way of describing things so precisely that all of your senses become engaged. There is this one scene in a candy shop where I swear I was gaining weight reading it because it was so acutely described, I might as well have been eating the candy!<br /><br />What I didn't like: 1) I'm not a big fan of first person alternating narration. When I get into a story I tend to miss things like chapter breaks. So when the narrator alternates, it throws me off.<br /><br />Overall thoughts: This was a well-written and unique story that left me wishing for Winter. Miz Stiefvater has managed to create a sweet love story in the midst of a paranormal plot with the potential for dangerous outcomes. The whole trilogy of The Wolves of Mercy Falls (of which this is book one) is already on shelves (which means I'm super late reading this one). This didn't leave us with a major cliff hanger, so I'll be waiting a while to read Linger (book 2).
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|This clip on  lens is AWESOME!! I absolutely LOVE it. It makes things so much bigger and really does add a TRUE macro effect to it. I can hardly believe it. I am still learning, but cool how you can take a few shots of 1 thing, such as a flower, and yet get such different 'view points' of it. I love it and not sure how I lived without it...seriously. I take it EVERYWHERE.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|Downloaded this but i don't have any kids. So who's going to use it? Could've put 1 star but since it's free i had to make it 2 stars.  Might have to make my own kids to make it 5 stars. Until then i' m sticking with 2 stars for right now.
B002N8A14M|5.0|You get two products in one - I love the clear case with the clip because I have a beautiful metallic colored Ipod and the clear case allows the color to be displayed.  The armband was an extra bonus since I really only wanted the clear case, but I use it now all the time when I'm working out and it's great, I'm not worried my ipod is going to fall off my waistband when I'm working out aggressively.    So, great product, so far I love both items.  Definitely worth the money spent.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I Bought this item so I can Game anywhere, and so far it has lived up to its expectations. (just need two outlets  1 to power screen and 1 to power your console)<br />I am currently using the older xbox 360 and it works great. The Case is legit, this thing is built to last, when you have it in your hands it just feels like its the real deal (as in it doesnt feel cheap or made with cheap materials) its solid sturdy and durable. Pop the bad boy open and you have a 15.5 LED screen(energy saver,15watts!) which is a beauty. the screen is bright, sharp and crisp, you get your moneys worth just with the screen its self. the screen dosent have a very good viewing angle so its made just for 1 or 2 people to be looking at the screen directly in front of it. it has 2 headphone jacks which is nice and a audio equalizer. comes with 2 pouches to fit your controllers and cords and power brick for your console. No Room for your games tho, so you would have to put your games in cd sleeves (those thin paper cd sleeves) so that they can go with you. I love it so far,so far it does not have any over heating problems.<br />Tip for xbox 360 users : when you boot up your console and its hooked up to the g155, go to the display settings on ur xbox. and go to \\"display discovery\\" and hit disable, this will allow your Xbox 360 give you alot more display options other than just the 480p 720p and 1080i/p, i found some of the resolutions to look alot softer and easier on the eyes.<br />I highly recommend this product, even if you just want to play in different places in the house lol. its really is cool, just play with your picture settings and have fun with it.<br /><br />Pros<br />Strong sturdy case<br />sharp crisp screen<br />dual headphone jacks<br />audio equalizer<br />loud speakers<br />Not as heavy as you would think (11 lbs)<br />cons<br />minimal picture settings<br />LED does not have a very good viewing angel.<br />tight squeeze with older xbox (power brick)
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Thank you, Amazon, for giving parents something worthwhile to share with our kids! This is better than a game for entertaining and playing with a young child. Our baby boy is almost at the age where he can make associations of cause and effect and this simple app is immensely helpful and stimulating for him.<br /><br />The uncluttered screen makes it easy to use for toddlers who may not have the best coordination yet. The bright colors and bold lines give instant gratification and attract attention.<br /><br />For those without kids, it might make an interesting diversion, but this is not Photoshop or a pro painting tool. There have been plenty of free Amazon apps featuring intense gaming action, camera tools, and productivity and lifestyle tools, it's refreshing to see something simple and useful that parents and babies will love!<br /><br />Given the immature nature of many of the complaints and negative reviews, I'm surprised those \\"babies\\" didn't find it entertaining. Perhaps when they are out of their \\"terrible twos\\" mental stage they will enjoy it more.
030788743X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It has a perfect blend of action, intrigue, and references to \\"ancient\\" technology. If reminiscing about your old Commodore 64 or TI 99/4A brings a smile to your face, this is the book for you.
0385738773|2.0|This series was mediocre at best. Really, the only reason that I finished it was because I am obsessive about finishing stories and I like zombie tales. The first book held my attention. The second book was a let down. The third was only readable because the bar had been lowered from the second book. I think Dashner is simply trying to capitalize on the trilogy method, that is you can sell three times as many books for one story if there are as many books.  Included in the writing style were minor annoyances that turned into major flaws that Dashner capitalized on all too often. For example, instead of gracefully bringing a character or characters into the story with some creativeness, they merely appear and announce their intentions/background without prompting and come back later. One good example of this is in the second book when the boys are locked inside of the building after being rescued and a crank comes to the window for no reason and says \\"I'm a crank! I'm crazy!\\" or something to that effect and then leaves. It has absolutely nothing to do with the story or influences the outcome in any manner other than it introduces that aspect of the book. I would expect to see that in grade school writing, not from an established author writing a trilogy.  One of the other things that bugged me was the language throughout the series. I know the target audience is the young adult, but trust me, young adults know most of the real words that Dashner had substitutes for. Making Dashner's attempt to fit into this reading group lame. Come on, the boys wake up and can't remember anything except english, but can't remember all of the specific words for feces or basic body functions so they make up new words? Wouldn't that mean that they would have to make up a whole new language or form of communication? Apparently the FCC had something to do with their memory wipe, which means we have to spend an inordinate amount of time learning new language for nouns/verbs we already know.   Unlike most of the other reviews, I don't mind some loose ends in this story. In fact, when books and movies try to wrap up all of the details (usually n a haphazard fashion)before the end, it's almost never done right and I like the ability to use my imagination a little bit to fill in the blanks.  Overall a great idea for a story. Unfortunately edited to fit an age group, which made the story and readability suffer overall.
B004L07KWQ|2.0|Neat ideas but it falls flat since there us no easy way to clear your picture. Kids like to start again and again.  Nice touch to be able to draw over photos and the undo feature is great.  I know it's free but there are flaws that make it useless to me.  I am sticking with Kids Doodle which is also free with cooler features like a play back mode.
B005LBYQ6M|5.0|I'm not sure who enjoyed this book more, me or my husband.  He thought it was so funny as I listed the components of the book - black ops, Vatican intrigue, end-of-the-world pandemic, pirates, cannibals, zombies, angels/aliens and Marco Polo.  The book was great fun!
B003L77G6A|5.0|AS ALWAYS THIS SHOW ALWAYS MAKES ME LAUGH AND SCREAM WITH UTTER DELIGHT.I DID ENJOY WHEN THE GUYS WERE CLUELESS ABOUT WOMEN AS IT DREW ON WHAT ALL MEN GO THRU TO BECOME MEN.
0525423281|5.0|Lola and the Boy Next Door, was like Anna and the French Kiss' quirky, spunky, sweet cousin, and I loved her!! And as an added bonus, we get to see Anna with Etienne!! As a couple!! I apologize in advance because this review is probably going to be gushy and incoherent!  Lola is a seventeen-year old high school girl who lives with her loving and strict dads in San Francisco. Lola has a passion for fashion, I mean \\"costume,\\" as an art form, because \\"Life is too short to be same person every day.\\" She also has a passion for her twenty-two year-old rocker boyfriend, Max, much to the dismay of her protective dads, who think he's too old for her. Max and Lola are hot and heavy, and she thinks he might be \\"the one.\\" But before Max, there was Cricket Bell, Lola's next door neighbor, who moved away two years ago, leaving a great big hole in her heart, and now he's back. Lola's determined to show him she's over him and she's moved on, but has she?  I loved, loved, loved this story!! This was such an awwww-so-sweet book that just fills your heart to bursting with emotion! Oh........the kissing scenes....so delightfully melty!! Stephanie Perkins has a gift for writing characters that you love even with all their quirks and faults. Lola was far from perfect, she struggles between Max and Cricket, but you love her anyways. Oh, and.........Cricket, Cricket, CRICKET!!!! I LOVE CRICKET!! He is so energetic and sweet and kind and cute!!! (Warned you about the gushing!) I loved this quote about him:  I needed him to touch me. I was obsessed with the way his hands never stopped moving. The way he rubbed them together when he was excited, the way he sometimes couldn't help but clap. The way he had secret messeges written on the back of his left. And his fingers. Long, enthusiastic, wild, but I knew from watching him build his machines that they were also delicate, careful, precise. I fantasized about those fingers.  Here are some more lovely quotes that either melt my insides or just about give me a cavity, there so sweet!!:  \\"Remember that day I made you the elevator?\\" he suddenly asks. I give him a faint smile. \\"How could I forget?\\" \\"That was the day I had my first kiss.\\" My smile fades. \\"I'm better now,\\" He sets the apple beside me. \\"At kissing, just so you know.\\"  I lean onto my tiptoes, rest my fingers against the back of his neck, and kiss him gently. Slowly. His tongue finds mine. Our hearts beat faster and faster, and our kisses grow hotter, and hotter until we burst apart from breathlessness. I smile, dizzily, and touch my swollen lips. These are not the kisses of a sweet, wholesome, boy next door.  So do you believe in second chances?\\" I bite my lip. \\"Second, third, fourth. Whatever it takes. However long it takes. If the person is right,\\" he adds. \\"If the person is... Lola?\\" This time, he holds my gaze. \\"Only if the other person is Cricket.\\"
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this app when it was free and have yet to regret it!  It's a relaxing and enjoyable. When you least expect it, you realize that you've been playing way over an hour.<br />HTC Droid Incredible
B0053VKP8S|3.0|Item worked as described... However, would not work on the TV I bought it for since the output format could not be changed on the TV. Tested it on another TV which allowed the digital output to be changed. Worked fine.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|i just don't know how i missed this movie on 2000 and it's scary but i liked it. This film will make you think.Whatch it to know what I mean!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|In combination with Arctic Silver 5, this HSF has dropped my CPU temperatures considerably over the stock HSF which is trash. However, installing this was a complete and utter nightmare, which is complicated further if it is less than half an inch from your DIMM bay.<br /><br />Buy it and use it, but prepare for an hour long struggle.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|This app is fun, its not something thas going to take up days and days, but it will occupy you when you are bored and is great for kids. I use it on a phone, but assume on a tablet its much better simply due to screen size. its simple and works. Pressing the back button to erase lines is easy and not a hassle. I suppose a &quot;clear all&quot; button would help, but, its not really a big deal.
0470901071|4.0|I just got through Cisco 1 and I did resource this book several times.  A book was not required for the class that I took but, I am still glad I got this one.  I will be able to use it throughout Cisco 4 and then to get my CCNA.  Some people say that you shouldn't get a book because of continuous improvements or changes. I have to disagree.  This version came out April 2011.  I am glad I purchased it. I know there are resources on the internet about subnetting.  I am hoping that Todd's book will be showing more that just one way to subnet.
B005GVW05Q|4.0|I've had this CD in the player in the car and at work for the last two days.  What I'm trying to decide is if that's the case because it's a great record, or because it's great background music.    This is probably the most consistently downbeat album that I've enjoyed since Hem's \\"Eveningland\\" (2004).  I usually like something with more variety in tempo, theme, and feel (Yes, some songs are a bit more energetic, like the title cut, the last section of Do I Wait, and Chains of Love, but we are talking matters of degree rather than kind here), but there is (at least for me) a pleasing consistency in this recording that works.  I have always enjoyed recordings with more of an intimate, stripped-down feel, and this one certainly qualifies.  Current favorites:  Invisible Riverside is at the top of the list, followed by Chains of Love, Kindness, and Lucky Now, but I would not argue with those who suggest that these are not remarkably inventive melodies or progressions.  Perhaps it is a statement about both the dearth of great popular music these days and my own 50-year-old myopia, but I am, at last for now, really enjoying this recording.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|We received this movie in blu-ray last week and couldn't wait to watch it! I had seen the movie before but my husband hadn't.   If you have seen this movie before, I'm sure you understand when I say that it's phenomenal. If you haven't, take my word for it when I say that it is a MUST SEE. My husband loved it as well and we were both crying by the end of the movie.  It is a heartwarming and touching story that leaves you inspired and enlightened.  As far as the quality, it is great. Worked great on our blue-ray machine and the shipment arrived intact and quickly.  I also thought the price for the product was reasonable.  HIGHLY recommend!
B001992NW4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and the Blu Ray picture is gorgeous and it comes with both the 73 original release and the Director's cut. It is also loaded with great behind the scenes footage that teaches literally how the whole movie was made which is great for filmmajors like me. Not only that there are documentaries that are fascinating too. This is a must own Blu Ray.
B004L07KWQ|1.0|Multi touch only makes lines, and makes multipal lines to quickly.  No 'clear all' option, you have to hit the back button over and over until clear.  Cant pick background color or change the color of paint in general. There are better paint programs that support true Multi Touch with color options and they are FREE.  HTC Thunderbolt
030788743X|5.0|What a fun read! Perhaps this is because I feel I am this book's target demographic, namely a nerd who grew up in the 80s. The references are nearly nonstop! I was constantly thinking, 'I remember that!' and getting nostalgic. I didn't get all the music references (not being the Rush fan the author appears to be) but the gaming, movie, computer, and general 80s and 90s pop-culture references were right up my alley!   A friend called me up out of the blue and insisted(!) that I immediately purchase this book and read it as he was about 100 pages in and was in nerd nirvana! I immediately went out and purchased a copy and have had no regrets whatsoever. I loved the book so much I bought copies for all my closest friends and foisted them upon them at our next meeting. They, also being nerds of the same generation, loved the book as much as I had (and have since passed their copies on to friends, co-workers and relatives)! My only regret was when the book was complete.   I hear the movie rights have already sold. I don't know how they could capture the nerd rapture of this very fun novel (not to mention the licensing for all the music, movies, books, and games mentioned within) but if they can, more power to them!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Helps me check my daughters math and science homework. Plus all the other cool things you can look up. Well worth 99 cents.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|Simply a must-have for any fan of the Killers. The setlist is brilliant, with every song flowing perfectly into one grand symphony. The energy, the showmanship, the magic--it's all there. The Killers are THE band of the new millennium and this is the finest example of their musical genius I've seen.   If you can't see them live, this DVD is the next best thing. I could watch it once a week without tiring.
B005IS565S|5.0|Their greatest album yet! ITS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD! Have it on repeat 24/7! awwwwwww yeaaaaaaa! If you don't own it, buy it from amazon right now!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|this game has blown my expectations away and after over 10 hours of gameplay i still cant put it down. if you liked rpgs on console, you'll enjoy this.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|very fun Final Fantasy style Rpg. I think it is a great bargain...helps to pass the time when shopping with a gf or when taking public transportation. highly recommended!.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|The sheer price I paid for this controller really made me comfortable trying it. I got it at toys r us for 20 dollars. I was pessimistic about it because I've never liked 3rd party controllers, and this one was no different.<br /><br />Pros -<br />The grip is a nice addition. After playing with a normal ps3/360 controller for a while, my hands usually get slightly sweaty, making the controller feel like I'm losing my grip on it. The texture of this one really seemed to fix that.<br /><br />The layout. I always prefered the 360 analog stick layout.<br /><br />The light up buttons are cool, and look good.<br /><br />The R2 and L2 buttons are a HUGE improvement. The sony brand controllers L2/R2 are horrible. These ones are a mix of 360 and ps3. I loved them.<br /><br />The Cons -<br />Sad to say, I was aware of the \\"dead zone\\" issue before i bought it. Yes, it totally ruined it for me. I was playing dark souls at the time (hence why i broke my original ps3 controller) and it's a game that requires very precise movements and actions. Maybe if I had tried harder, I could have gotten used to it though.<br /><br />The L1 and R1 buttons also are less sensitive. You have to press the buttons firmly, as opposed to just gently touching them.<br /><br />The wireless reciever was annoying as well. But it wasn't a big problem.<br /><br />But like I said, I only paid 20 for it, and am happy to have it as a backup for the future, or as a second controller should I ever need it. Decent product, but beware of what I said, and only buy this if you just need a cheap 2nd controller
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I still prefer the books over any of the movies in the series, but it was nice to see it come to life in the movies.  Magic combat is kind of boring, needs more involvement then just flicking a wand.  Maybe learning spells requires much more time or something to make the spells you know as a person much more personal and this way combat would be more unique since people would choose their own styles.  The movie overall was great, watching it again tonight.    Also, not sure why people are complaining about Ultraviolet digital copy, I just tried streaming it over my computer and it worked fine.  I had to make an account since I am new to the website but that wasn't a big deal.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I rarely give reviews, but this is the best of all the Jane Eyre film adaptations that have been made thus far. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and this one is the most accurate and attentive to detail. The 2011 version is beautiful, the music, the aesthetics, but their relationship is hardly developed and feels rushed and lacking in depth. I absolutely love this film!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|very awesome movies, I have always enjoyed Planet of the Apes.  Can't wait to see it on blu-ray and 7.1 surround sound, should be awesome as usual.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|First, I would have rated 5 stars except for in thing. When the app is started you don't know it is running. it immediately opens to the drawing board.   Other than that I really like the app. My kids will enjoy it. I will too. :-)
B0058A119G|5.0|Is Barbra Streisand's voice exquisite. I bought this CD with trepidation, after all she is nearly 70 and I expected her voice to falter, like the late great Frank Sinatra or (sorry to say Tony Bennett who hides his weak vocal chords behind flashy duets). Her voice may be in it's finest epoch. I agree with the reviewer who remarked on Streisand's golden period during the last 10 years or so. In the autumn of her career she has recorded her finest work. In my opinion her 60s voice was a little shrill at times. Loved her voice in the 70s and 80s but mostly hated her choice of material, with a few exceptions. Lately it's been a perfect blend of choice material with a smooth and silky voice. Her voice is a national treasure. BTW I've seen her live twice and her voice is not \\"sweetened\\" in the recording studio. Her live voice is just as wonderful as her recorded voice.
0439796644|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and looking forward to the movie in December.  It is a great children's book, but the movie may have graphic scenes.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Fast, sealed and at the right price. We do these family movie night get togethers almost every week. It was great to order this product and get it as promised for the weekend. Thor story was fair but the 3D was awesome on our 72\\" Mitsubishi.
1402210795|2.0|I can't understand why so many people love this book. While I like Georgette Heyer, this book was too long, contrived, and boring. The hero both hits and slaps his wife, which is disgusting, and the heroine is not just inexperienced, she's willfully stupid. I found myself skimming the last third of this book, because it was so boring and plodding. I will definitely not be keeping it.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I knew coming into this that the \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2\\" was going to be incredible.  I had heard from others that had seen it that it was very true to the book.  They were right.  I was amazed to see the 2nd half of the book come to life on the big screen.  The special effects were incredible!  I do remember crying a few times during a few scenes...  Which is a good thing of course.<br /><br />The acting was great.  Of course Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were terrific as always (loved them in the epilogue).  But the one person's performance who I just adored, even though he wasn't in the movie much was Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Talk about a riveting performance.  He deserves an award for the scenes he was in!  The scene between him and Harry was just so emotional and perfect.  You really learn to love Snape in this film.  I know everyone probably knows what happens but just in case, I'm not going to say.<br /><br />I understand that many people are not happy with the ultraviolet digital copy of the movie that comes with this.  I have never used the digital copy of the movies I have purchased on Blu-Ray/DVD combo packs so this doesn't really affect me but I do understand why others are unhappy...who wants to pay for a digital copy of a movie they have already bought?!  Anyway.....<br /><br />All in all this was a great ending to an incredible decade of Harry Potter.  I still can't believe it's been 10 years since The Sorcerer's Stone came out.  Definitely buy this, whether on DVD or the Blu-Ray combo pack...you are going to LOVE it if you haven't seen it already!
B004ZN9R6G|4.0|Someone in one of these reviews described this album as \\"the runt of the Floyd litter,\\" and I really can't think of a better way to describe this oft-overlooked gem.  Sure, it would have made a lot more sense continuity-wise if this album had come after \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" instead of sandwiched between much more-realized efforts of \\"Meddle\\" and \\"Dark Side of  the Moon.\\"  Then again, Floyd recorded this album in just two weeks -- really, the last glimpse of spontaneous work we would ever see from this band.  Given that, there are some surprisingly good songs on this record.  Most of them, in fact.  As with \\"Meddle,\\" the sound here is a great improvement.  I hear a lot more separation between the instruments, and the guitar and cymbals sound much brighter than before.  Likewise, the bass end has quite a bit more resolution depth.  The biggest winners here are the title track, \\"When You're In,\\" \\"Wot's....Uh the Deal,\\" and \\"Childhood's End\\".  You really can't go wrong here.  As with the rest of these remasters, this is a great improvement over past re-releases.
B0055SWM08|5.0|the game play is fluid (pun intended) and the graphics are top notch...i would definitely recommend this game to friends!
B002LW9ITY|5.0|Then this is a great set to get! It includes a version of the hard to find and expensive Rescue Mater, which if your kid has seen the Mater Tales cartoons, they will want BADLY. The Gold McQueen is nice too and goes great with the gold Mia and Tia that were available with Bling Bling McQueen in a three pack a few years ago. My kid is nuts about Cars and likes playing with the little diecast cars put out by Mattel so this was a no brainer buy for us.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|The watch arrived defective so I could never use it. Since I live outside the US I had to wait until I traveled back there to request Garmin for a replacement.  Garmin has an official representative in my country but the Warranty is not international so they didn't replace it. This is a shame for such a Global brand.  Right now I'm in the process of getting the replacement. Lets see how that goes.
B00533D3CQ|5.0|As others have stated, this not what expected from Peter Murphy in 2011. I anticipated a middle aged attempt at holding on to past glories. Instead what we get in Ninth (and Secret Bees of Ninth ep) is a complete return to form that rivals his best Holy Smoke and Deep. Hell, it might even be his best solo release. Wherever you place it in the heirarchy of his solo releases, it commands repeated listens (as most of his music does). I find it encouraging that along with some pretty cool newer artists, veterans who have been at it for 30 plus years turn out some of the best music of the decade. That is certainly the case here. We should have known all was well with Murphy after hearing reports of the last Bauhaus tour where hung upside down to perform.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this live in the US on October 2nd and like my fellow reviewers, it was \\"PHANTASTIC\\"!  I have seen the show twice before and loved it and have always loved the beautiful music.  Andrew Lloyd Webber did a great job with this (along with Cameron Mackintosh) production.  Ramin and Sierra shone as the Phantom and Christine.  I'm not going to lie -- I wan't sure about Sierra at first since I had never heard her sing before, but she's amazing.  And Ramin...my goodness!  I saw him as Enjorlas in the 25th Anniversary Concert of Les Miserables as well and he was so powerful there.  I knew he'd make the perfect Phantom.<br /><br />What I really loved about this was you truly felt like you were not only there at the Royal Albert Hall, but that you had a front row seat (better than a front row seat even).  The close-ups are amazing.  And this was not in a concert style format like Les Mis was last year.  It was the entire show (nothing left out!!) with the actors actually acting, not just standing at a microphone singing.<br /><br />The end of the show was just...I still, after two weeks of seeing it cannot even begin to explain the ending/encore.  Of course ALW came out and gave a speech and then introduced the original London cast minus Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman.  I was a little bummed but of course, he announced them after the cast had come out.  So great to see both of them and I must say Michael looks as good now as he did in 1986!!!  And Sarah...wow.  She sings 'Phantom of the Opera' as four past Phantoms (including Colm Wilkinson, John Owen Jones and Anthony Warlow...there was one more but I forgot his name) came out and sang with her.  It was great!  But that wasn't it.  The four Phantoms (plus Ramin) sang the most beautiful version of Music of the Night.  I got goosebumps.  It was just gorgeous!  I wish that Michael Crawford had sung as well, but I'm guessing he had a good reason.<br /><br />This is definitely a DVD worth buying and watching over and over again.  I know I will!again.  I know I will!
0385534639|3.0|I was really torn on what to write for this review.  I enjoyed the book, but my main problem was that the author kept me in suspense for so long that by the time of the big reveal at the end of the book, I almost didn't care what was happening.  Now I feel like I have to go back and reread the whole thing just to understand what I missed the first time around.  I think some of this may be because the characters needed additional development, as I didn't understand the motivation behind some of the events.  I would have liked to have known more about the twins, Poppet and Widget, and especially Bailey.  I never really understood the motivation for any of his actions, and it almost seemed like his sole purpose was to be there when the author needed someone to do something.  There were also several times when something interesting was mentioned, and I was SURE I would see it tied in later, but then the subject is dropped, never to be mentioned again.  The descriptions, however, were amazing.  I felt like I was really there, walking on the chalky grass, ducking into striped tents, and watching the clock slowly transform as time passed.  A decent first novel, although I think it never lived up to its promise, which is a shame.  However, I'll be looking forward to seeing how Erin Morgenstern develops as a writer with her future novels.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This series is amazing.  It is definitely a combination of Gladiator and 300 and you are pulled in on the very first episode and it continues the whole way through.  I heard the short prequel season they made after this wasn't that great but I'm stoked for the second full season of Spartacus.
1400069181|3.0|The book is very \\"personal\\". It cannot be considered an \\"academic\\" book about entrepreneurship. Read it as if a friend is sharing with you his experience and give you some tips along the way. I appreciate that the author didn't do a long book(since it lacks all that \\"density\\", doing a long book would have being a disaster). The reading is very light, so it is also enjoyable. I guess that the best thing about the book is that it lets you a bit \\"hungry\\" for doing something \\"that matters\\".  The only problem with the book is that it tries to be too many things at the same time, so it ends up being none: It is not a \\"textbook\\" on entrepreneurship, since it lacks density, and cannot (fully) be an inspirational book, since it lacks more details about the story. Overall, it is a good book to read, but it is not a \\"must have\\" for your personal library
B001VNB54A|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Audio and video on bluray are amazing. A lot of research went into this production and its clear it was done by professionals.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|It is a fun little paint program.  Very simple.  Just put your finger on the screen and draw.  The only thing that it needs is a clear all option.  Took off one star because of that.  But still very cool.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|pretty cool. Love the sketch option for taking photos. just wish there was an option to use the front facing camera also. But in all am happy with it.
0670022411|2.0|::POSSIBLE SPOILERS::  I bought A Discovery of Witches based on Amazon's recommendation, and I have to say, I was pretty disappointed in what I got.  I guess I was expecting a well-written fantasy novel, with lots of magic, and interesting characters.  What I got was a Twilight knockoff/romance novel, with a ridiculously weak and pathetic \\"heroine\\" who all the other characters keep reminding us is brave and strong (maybe if we keep saying it, it will eventually be true!!).  The hero isn't much better, following the \\"vampire with a conscience\\" cliche.  Oh, and he has perfect hair.  And perfect clothes.  And a perfect wine collection.  And a perfect house.  And a perfect library.  And he was good buddies with every important person born in the last 1500 years.  Wait, I almost forgot!  There's also this manuscript that all the magical creatures in the world want to get their hands on, but it's basically forgotten once the heroine and the vampire get together, because of course their lovemaking and goo-goo eyes are much more interesting than an actual plot would be.<br /><br />To make it worse, the whole middle section of the book involved the \\"heroine\\" sleeping 20 hours a day and drinking a lot of tea (it's rough being a witch!!).  The only really interesting thing that happens is when the \\"heroine\\" runs into another witch in France, but most of that section is glossed over.  I slogged through the last 400 pages, determined not to give up, only to find that the other reviewers were right....there's no ending.  The book just stops.  This book needed a good editor to cut the entire middle section, making the book about 200 pages shorter.  The author also needed to give us some sort of closure, even if she plans on continuing the story in a sequel.  And I'm certainly very disappointed in the Amazon recommendation system, since it appears that the hype itself was enough to get this book through the screening system, since there's not much else to recommend it.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Just buy it, you won't be disappointed. It's fast. It's affordable-ish. It overclocks well. These latest gen Intels will probably take over our world Skynet style. But we will love them until they do.
B005ELQVGW|1.0|I have listened to Bjork for decades.  She is a true genius, having made music that is out of this world and even more.  I own most of her albums and almost without exception rate them highly.  Having said that, I bought this CD on release day.    Biophilia is, however, an exception.  She seems to have been smitten by the Cat Miaww music bug, think of Feist or Olof Arnalds.  I know, such music is the rave in many cool corners today, I am just not at home in such areas.  This album is so slow with vocals seeming to be in no coherence to the music.  Sad to say but this is just really boring, close to not being listenable.  Judging from most reviews, I am in a minority here.  If you like Bjork, adore Miaww music and don't mind listening to very slow albums, this is for you.  If not, I suggest you look elsewhere.

0670022950|4.0|This is a huge book which has one central thesis that claims this: violence is down. Compared to the atrocities committed in the past by many sane or insane rulers, groups or tribes, today we are lucky to live in a relatively Long Peace( to quote Pinker's quotation of Gaddis).<br />The book is divided into a historical part and a psychological one. To be more precise: the first part is about the historical dimensions of crimes perpetrated by the human beings against each other throughout history, starting from the Old Testament days, the Roman Empire, culminating in the Middle Ages, where many and various ingenuous torture methods were applied on people. These chapters contain a lot of data, figures and graphs to support the thesis that the past, meaning from the Neanderthal Man to the present, has been riddled with atrocities, while the change of all this occurred during the 18th century onwards. The reason was the Scientific Revolution which took place then and the rise of skepticism, the rise of reason and the decline of religion. All this came after the civilizing process started, a term that was used by Norbert Elias in his famous book. Elias argued that this process started in the Middle Ages, when feudal states decided to start establishing commercial relations. The invention of printing and the education of the masses by the reading of books has softened the appetite of them for blood and has caused to a re-evaluation of certain axiomatic ideas in this respect. Literacy and the state, or \\"the Leviathan\\",  have been the factors which contributed to the decline of violence, although Pinker is cautious about the interpretation of statistical data and facts which might contradict his own thesis.<br />The second part of the book is about the structure of the brain and the way the human beings are wired for aggression. Yes, we are and will probably be aggressive from the first to the last day of our lives. In two chapters Pinker explains to the reader the functions of the various brain parts and their relevance to his discussion. In his view, the twentieth century was not the most violent one, as many observers have opined. He blames this misjudgement of historical myopia, since historians and other researchers tend to overlook the facts of the distant past and concentrate of the last 200 years, thus magnifying the present and distorting the past events which, in his view, contained much more violence than all the wars combined in the twentieth century. Genocides are far from being a modern invention. The process of civilizing has known some setbacks after World War Two, especially in the 1980s, but has gone back on the right track since then. Feminisation, the civil rights movements, the awareness of and fight for animal rights, the preservation of minorities' rights in the USA or elsewhere and democracy-all these have played a part in reducing violence in those respective regimes and countries. In fact, most crimes were committed by regimes whose rulers were totalitarian and for whom democratic principles were a big taboo. Mass media and the mobility of the masses convinced people in the Global Village that others like them have various opinions and beliefs or values. Pinker adds that the application of reason can further lead to a continuation of the process he describes.<br />All in all, this book is very interesting, although some chapters might not be for those who have a sensitive stomach because of the graphic scenes contained in them. The language is friendly and vivid, even humorous. However, there are two problems in my view which are a minus: the book is extremely long and requires a lot of patience and many parts of it are repetitive. I do understand that Pinker worked hard in order to convince his readers, and the fact that he commands such an enormous corpus of sources is commendable. Still, it would have been better for the editor to have deleted some of its parts. That's the reason I award it only four stars.
B00516ZWRE|5.0|What a fantastic band, i just got to see them live here in the states last weekend ant they opened with \\"Gods Of War\\" which is also the first song on this cd and it stacks up to the legendary Saxon anthems like \\"Power and the Glory\\" & \\"Heavy Metal Thunder\\".  I didn't think they could top the \\"Labryinth\\" release but they did.  FANTASTIC!!!
B004L07KWQ|4.0|this app is neat and it does allow for some interesting pictures to be drawn, however, it says it is multi-touch where it is pseudo-multi-touch. The multi-touch does not work in the fashion of any multi-touch app out there. Instead of being able to draw multiple lines at the same time it stretches a line between your two fingers, which, while interesting is not what I picture as true multi-touch. Other than that it is a good app to have if you are bored or have kids.
B000687M48|5.0|This DVD / CD does in fact capture Evanescence at a peak in their somewhat fractured career - yes, the video does jump around at times but I've seen far worse.  Sound and video quality are excellent - which is not always the case with these packages.  It was kinda cool seeing the multitude of different camera angles that otherwise, we'd never see.  Add that to having the music videos and behind the scenes...only $9....Totally worth the $'s.  They are back...but I think the world missed out on several years of what coulda shoulda woulda been from an incredibly talented singer and band.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I had never before read this book, but I had loved the movie for many years. I decided to download the free kindle book and read it. It was a truly touching story, but I have found that it varies somewhat from what I remember from the movie. Of course that is always the case. Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12.
0446547654|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books, but lately have been disappointed. It is as if he has written every good plot he can think of so now, in desperation, turns to the cliches that are sure-fire tissue twisters. In Safe Haven, which I really did like because it was so different than his other books, Sparks added the element of suspense and a tiny bit of a ghost angle. Well, after experimenting with it and seeing it pleased his fans, he's gone all out with it in this book, landing a ghost as a secondary character and throwing in a couple of back hill goons with a love for their Glocks.   Here's the plot in a nutshell. Dawson Cole, the kid from the wrong side of the track and Amanda Collier, the rich pretty girl fall in love. Alas, their love is doomed, so they part ways, but this love was so very strong Dawson could never find it in him to love another and led a loner life. (I ask ... how many guys would go their ENTIRE lives without ever being with a woman or wanting a family, content to keep company with a memory?) Amanda though, has married a dentist who drinks too much and makes her miserable. She compares herself to an otter asleep on the side of his cage at the zoo, knowing this isn't the life she's supposed to live but with no way out. Even on her wedding day, she wished the poor man at the end of the aisle away, longing for Dawson.  The book begins with Dawson knowing that he should have died when the oil rig he worked on had an explosion. But instead, after he flopped in the water, this dark haired man in a wind breaker appears and Dawson swims towards him to safety. Suddenly this wind breaker guy is popping up here and there, sometimes just a flicker in the corner of his eye, but Dawson can never get a close look at him before he disappears. (That weird secondary character I mentioned earlier.)  An old man from his hometown dies and his attorney requests Dawson's presence. This old man, named Tuck, was a friend so he goes and, lo and behold, who else should the attorney have also called into town, but Amanda, who was also friends with Tuck. Now Tuck was a raging romantic and he'd planned before his death in great detail a fabulous, bring out the sex night away for these two at a little cottage set in paradise. (which brings to mind the already done Nights in Rodanthe.) I will leave you hanging so you can breathlessly turn pages to see if they give in to temptation. I thought this whole bit was cliched, due to the fact a thousand novels have been written about sisters, friends, mothers and daughters, and ex-lovers who are forced together due to a funeral. It's not exactly a surprise what happens.  While all of this romance and rediscovery is happening, there is the threat of some of Dawson's wrong side of the law cousins. (Sparks makes these guys like comic book villians with no real personalities.) Suddenly between these rough neck characters and another surprise event, the novel goes from the sinewy muscles of Dawson's arms' and the heat of his breath on her neck, to a breakneck switch that throws the readers out of their dreamy state into a bucket of cold water.   And then the end. Sparks does his best to make it a fine mix of happy slash sad. He always tries to get in those hankie moments and he really goes for broke with the last pages. One can see what's coming, and whether you're clinging to your tissue and saying, \\"Oh Sparks, you did it again,\\" or \\"I can't believe it's come to this - a recycled tear jerker' - either way one must admire Nicholas Sparks. Many a woman would love a man who can think so romantic and put so much of his heart into words.   Or is it just that he has a formula for novels he knows will sell?  Either way, I will continue to read every novel Nicolas Sparks puts out there. There's always a hope the next one will be better and there have been some really great ones already written. Safe Haven is one of those and I can't wait until the movie comes out(mentioned in Acknowledgments).  In ending, readit because truly you can't go wrong with anything he writes but don't expect a novel that will knock you away with its fresh plot.
B005UVYXPW|5.0|Discovered SOA about 6 months ago on Amazon Instant Video. I frickin love this show. Watched all 3 seasons in about a months time and I can't get enough.  Jax is sexy as hell - the dark humor, plot twists, bad boys and naughty bits have me waiting week to week to see what happens next. This season - and this episode in particular - makes me think this will be the last season. The writing is great, characters are believable and interesting. I feel like a voyeur every time I watch...and just about every character is my favorite. Tig for his sick personality, Happy is just brutal, Piney is just drinking himself to death over the past, Opie and Jax relationship is great to watch. Bobby seems the most down to earth - even though he is an Elvis impersonator!  The \\"girls\\" are tuff. Jemma and the Doc don't take much crap from anyone, including their men. Great show, great acting, great characters, what more could I ask for?

B003VA3JUO|5.0|A lot of reviews of the various DVD and VHS editions of this chilling film have appeared. Some folks are snobs about the \\"horror film\\" genre, not one for which I have myself much taste to see regularly, since the supernatural tends to spook me out too easily. Frankly, what attracted me initially to this movie is the seafaring aspect. I love the lore of big 19th and 20th century powered ships, especially really large ones, military or civilian, such as the Antonia Graza, the ocean-liner featured in the fictional \\"Ghost Ship\\". I served as a sailor in the U.S. Navy (something that awakened me, as early as my late teens, to the sheer dastardliness of both the U. S. of A.`s and Britain`s imperialist ventures abroad), most of the time on a ship that was at sea a good deal in all kinds of conditions in all parts of the Alantic, Artic, and Indian Oceans (and in Antarctic waters, too); I was only at sea specifically in the Pacific during those years very briefly, on a quite large vessel (a supply ship that also served as a troop transport vessel) before being transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. These ships dated from years of construction and/or refitting roughly contemporaneous with that of the film's Antonia Graza. I was in a position to see all parts of the ship on which I served longest quite often, more so than most of the seamen of the crew, since my labours took me from the bilge right up to the top of the rigging quite a lot. That was mostly on a relatively small ship (a destroyer), so I really love seeing films of grandiose, humongous vessels such as the Antonia Graza of this movie.<br /><br />All of the foregoing is simply to attest to my ability to size up the authenticity of the ship portrayal in this film (not to make a lot here of my few years of seafaring). The detail is well-nigh flawless! I usually had no difficulty recognising in what parts of the ship the action occurs at any time or what the machinery therein is. One cannot say that of all films, let me tell! This is a beautifully, very skillfully, and evocatively filmed work of cinema. It also is very suspenseful and exciting! I have to admit that re-seeing it after the initial time makes the action and motivations clearer to me. One needs to watch the film carefully to understand in every detail what is happening, the people (live or ghostly) as well as what is around them. This is more than a movieland popcorn-chewer's film.<br /><br />I had hoped that the extra features would explain what the film is about better than, in fact, they do. However, those features on the DVD edition viewed are quite interesting regarding the making of the film, so they make having replaced my VHS copy with a DVD quite worthwhile.<br /><br />If you like horror, gore, ghosts, the sea, and rusting mid-20th century technology, this film is for you!

1401902197|5.0|I have always liked Louise Hay books and this one is no exception. Listening to her cd each day lifts up the spirit. She has wonderful food for thought material and it sets the tone for the day. Reading the book alone would be enough to up lift a person and put you on to a path of better thinking. Ms. Hay challenges one to think and act differently in a loving positive way. Enjoy.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|This movie is amazing. Anyone that gets all pissed off because it doesn't follow the comics is an idiot. 99% of movies that are based on a comic or book don't follow it to a T. As long as you go into the movie knowing that it doesn't follow it, you'll love the movie
B005I64U5C|1.0|This movie can only be downloaded into Flixster and NOT iTunes. You will be required to create accounts with Flixter and Ultraviolet, required to link the accounts so each service can share all information they have about you with each other as well as Warner Brothers.  Before downloading, you are required to download and install the Flixster Collections App and Adobe Air.  They are more than happy to let you watch as many times as you want by streaming the video, but then you have to burn through minutes on your data plan everytime you are not connected to Wi-Fi.  Why should we have to pay to watch a movie again and again when you already own.  I'm not doing anything on any clouds from Apple or anyone else, its ridiculous.  It is also the last time I buy a Warner Brothers movie with digital copy from Amazon. I will also be carefully watching to see if and when digital copies from other studies are released on Ultraviolet.
1250004349|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was heart warming and informative.  Even though every other chapter jumped from past to present, I could keep track of the story.  I was sorry that the main character could not meet the young girl she was searching form.  Anyone interested in knowing if some of the events really happened can look on the internet and find out they did.  Overall a very enjoyable read.  I would like to read more of her books.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Dear Amazon, how dare you remember people that there are kids in the world? that is so inconsiderate! I say We should also give one star to the public schools and kindergartens because they are also inconsiderate providing education to kids, don't they know that there are people that will get offended if they see kids. Gap should also get rid of the baby gap! (can you see the sarcasm? c'mon people, grow up)
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|For a film shot over 40 years ago, the remastering of the sound and images is amazing.  I am not from that generation (much younger) but watching these DVDs felt like being there.  A fantastic job.  Watch it with the sound turned way up!
B0059R5Q08|5.0|**possible spoiler alert, but really, who doesn't know Jane Eyre?** I have read, studied, and loved Jane Eyre (the novel, and the BBC miniseries with Toby Stephens) for years, and was hesitant to watch this, as all people are who love the novel. But honestly? I loved it. I thought the filmmakers did an awesome job of condensing a complex story into a 2 hour film. I enjoyed the way much of Jane's childhood was told through flashbacks while she was with the St.Johns; I thought it was a great way to work in those necessary details without spending too long on them and letting the audience get to the good stuff, ie: Rochester and Jane. Michael Fassbender is a fantastic Rochester. He's broody, quietly funny, goading, maybe a little bit dangerous, passionate, and just lovely. Fassbender pulls it off with aplomb. Mia Wasikowska is a brilliant Jane Eyre, and so is the actress who played Jane at Lowood School. The scenes between Jane and Rochester (especially the proposal scene when Jane declares herself Rochester's equal) is pivotal in the novel and can be tricky to get right without being melodramatic, but I thought it was well done in the film; although, I was waiting for the lightning to strike the tree, which disappointingly didn't happen. I once wrote a paper on how Jane represented Rochester's chance at redemption for his sins against Antoinette (read  Wide Sargasso Sea if you want to know why Rochester's wife isn't named Bertha), and was pleased that several of Rochester's lines supported that theme. I appreciate it when films can stay true not only to the plot of a novel, but the meanings behind the action as well. The cinematography was beautiful, the music appropriately haunting and dramatic without being overly done. The BBC version will still be my favorite, mostly because it's a miniseries and is able to tell the story more completely than the traditional two-hour format for films, but this version is one of the best I've seen, and far better than I was expecting. Well done and highly recommended.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I have not read the book, so I'm not sure if this mini series is 100% accurate; but it was so well done that I'm sure we can overlook the times that it may not quite match up.<br /><br />The actors played their parts so well! They were REAL! My heart broke for poor Pet in her unfortunate marriage, and for Amy when she found her love unrequited; I was happy-crying at the end as Arthur and Amy finally ended up together; I laughed so hard at the antics of Arthur's foolish suitor (I can't remember her name...).<br /><br /> Basically, this movie has it all, and is a lovable classic that I will enjoy time and time again.
0385344325|5.0|This is by far my favorite Jack Reacher novel. Set in 1997 Mississippi, Reacher is a MP and is sent to investigate the murder a woman near a military base.  One murder turns out to be three murders. Child never lets the suspense or the question of whom and why let up. The doubt and curiosity I hade with certain characters followed me with each page. Reacher's only focus is to find the truth no matter what happens to him. It is his passion for that truth that led me to finally discover how and why Reacher became the wonderer he is. This was a great mystery and a great story!<br /><br />I don't remember a great deal of sex in the Jack Reacher books. I have lots of romance novels and nothing compares to the writing of a particular sex scene in Chapter 43. It is absolutely outstanding. It is not gratuitous since it plays into the mystery. It is not vulgar and Child did not use any foul language in the scene. Most of the \\"best\\" romance writers use salaciousness and chessiness in a sex scene. Not with Child. He uses a midnight train.  Child had me mesmerized and not just with that scene. What a great writer!<br /><br />Another interesting part of the book is Reacher trying to contact his brother who left for Georgia - which probably led Reacher there  for book #1 - [[ASIN:B0046F0PC8 Killing Floor]].  I'm ready for Reacher's next adventure.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|What can you possibly say about a band with a line up like this. I can't say that the music breaks any new ground but the level of quality in this album (Far superior to the first) is some of the best rock out there right now. They've worked very hard on getting the lyrics better, and it shows. Songs like Three and a Half Letters speak of what most people of the world are feeling due to Banker and Corporate Greed and Political ineptitude. If only it were toxic to the likes of those talentless pretty boys and girls that clog up this industry with their bland pitiful tunes. I thought the days of band like the The Who, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors etc were over. Jane's Addiction helped keep rock alive throughout the 90's, now there's Chickenfoot. I am totally amazed that we still depend on the likes of Pete Townsend, Robert Daltry, Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, Michael Anthony and Chad Smith, even though Sammy is 63, he rocks far harder than pretty much anyone else. What else can you expect from a band made up of former Van Halen, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and  well Guitar Virtuoso Joe Satriani (If you don't know him that well check out his solo work). He taught Kirk Hamett of Metallica how to play as well as the king of the space age guitar Steve Vai, and even strung and tuned his very first guitar.  IF you're into rock music you simply cannot miss this album, get it, you won't be disappointed
B000001FTD|5.0|One of THE defining metal albums of it's generation. I saw that the whole band was getting back together to record/release a new album with a tour and had to replace this one that went missing. Still awesome.

I'm familiar enough with Green Lantern to know, though, that a few things were off about it, but a lot of it was dead on, and while I thought they could have done a bit more with this movie, it was still really cool.  Don't let any negative comments deter you from checking this one out.  If you like superhero movies & sci-fi & such, you oughta be right at home with this movie.

Seeing fimilar AP photos and previously talking to the aquapons through this site that were mentioned in your book. It really hits home if aquaponics is your thing. As it is mine! Aquariums, planted aquariums, ponds, and AP. It is true finding info and learning about AP is tough at times, for me, espically when I went through my phases with bell syphons!! Doing well now and your book will only further my knowledge and practices!  Lily Pond Farm CSA couldn't have been possible without finding your site and all the positive and helpful members.

B005AUWY90|2.0|After watching the first 10 minutes there is at least two dozens deaths (animated deaths but deaths none the less) and it just shocked me how can a movie like this be rated G. Which demographic are this people aiming to? A 1960's based spy movie? Are they serious? Of course people are going to say \\"Get a life. There's death and violence in the real world, kids should be prepared to accept death as natural part of life, blah blah blah\\". But what's the message in this movie? Bad people lose, good looking people win? That's the Disney motto, not Pixar's. This sequel does not compare to the Toy Story sequels if you're going to name other sequels made by Pixar.  The original plot was about character development, friendship, being humble, recognizing ones faults and growing up.  This movie is just an action movie not a family movie. I was disappointed to see that John Lasseter contributed to the story of this movie and it is a shame since this movie differs so much from the first one that one can only think that he was ordered to produce a sequel. Mr Lasseter, if you're not on the Board you just are an employee; forget whatever title they give.  If the movie does not sell you'll be held accountable and fired a second time from the same company. Seems that the winning streak of Pixar has ended. Better luck next time.  P.S.  \\"Planes?\\" How original. Another marketing tool.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|This is an excellent heat-sink/cooler.  My only issue was that they didn't say that you need to remove the motherboard to install it (so much for easy installation and swap-out).  It wasn't too much of a hassle, but it was unexpected, so four stars instead of five.

B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|I have to laugh at many of the 1 & 2 star reviews.  Granted, this record is not Murmur.  But no album since Murmur has been Murmur!  Get a clue people!  If you have bothered to listen carefully to REM over their entire career (as I have) you'll see that their albums are like snowflakes: no two are alike.  Yet everyone wants them to keep recording Out of Time and Automatic every time they go into the studio.  Yes, they lost a lot when Berry left.  But I have found plenty to like on Up, Reveal, Around the Sun, Accelerate and Collapse Into Now.  This latest record is good.  Plain and simple.  I hear that common thread that says, \\"We are REM, and this is what we do!\\" on this record.  \\"It Happened Today\\" is fantastic.  The slower cuts \\"Oh My Heart,\\" \\"Everyday is Yours to Win,\\" and \\"Walk it Back\\" are excellent.  Now that REM has decided to call it a day, the album makes a lot more sense, especially the last cut, \\"Blue.\\"  This band has made a mark on music that may not be replicated in a long time.  They deserve more than the baseless, misguided \\"I was a big fan back in the early days when Document came out\\" fools who think REM is no longer relevant.  It's a great record.  If you're fan, you'll like it.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|Did I watch the same movie as some of you? This makes Blair Witch look like Citizen Kane. Absolutely boring. If you have seen the trailer, that's all there is. There is a shock at the end (last 2 minutes or so) but that's all. The rest is a guy walking around with a video camera (while his girlfriend keeps telling him to shut it off) waiting for something to happen. Other than some bed sheets lifting up as if someone passed gas in bed, there is nothing. I almost fell asleep and actually fast forwarded parts waiting for something to happen, it doesn't. Additionally, some of the same scenes get repeated. I have no clue what that is for. Remember those short Halloween videos people send where something jumps out at the last minute? That's what this movie is, one scene, at the end, that's it. Sorry if I ruined it for you but there is nothing here. \\"Be afraid -- be very afraid\\" of wasting 1 hour and 45 minutes doing nothing.
1400052181|4.0|Rebecca Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks should be a must-read for every medical student and biological research scientist.  Skloot shows, in recounting past unethical practices of physicians and scientists in their drive to answer questions and make money from it, that greed is not isolated to Wall Street types.  We think we've come a long way from the barbarism of past centuries and horrendous \\"research\\" done by Nazi doctors.  But a reading of events from recent decades in this book gives a clear picture of the absolute necessity for regulation and principled oversight of the medical world.  In a country where in the sixties a doctor who knowingly injected research subjects with cancer cells was not even tried for the crime, we must remember that a society with racial and socio-economic equality in medical care is at best, even in parts of the country which pride themselves in their egalitarian attitudes, a fragile thing to be zealously promoted, guarded and enforced.

B00064WSNW|4.0|King Crimson transformed themselves reinventing the very medium they were cocooned within. The lyrics and music became less surreal though no less captivating. On this release some of their most well known pieces were to emerge, becoming live favourites.<br /><br />Elephant Talk begins this so well with the polyrhythmic patterns of Robert Fripp and the estranged singing of Belew. Bruford's drumming is a key feature as always and Levin plays a mean bass.<br /><br />Frame By Frame is certainly an excellent song with some innovative musicianship. Indiscipline is a stunning progressive masterpiece, which captures the feeling of being obsessed over nothing more than anything you will hear. The spoken lyrics have a power of their own but it is those time sig shifts when the band begin to crunch out that hypnotic riff which makes this a classic.<br /><br />Thela Hun Ginjeet is also mesmirising with a repeated mantra and motif that hooks into your system. The Sheltering Sky is a longer piece at 8:22, that showcases the prowess of Levin and Bruford.<br /><br />It ends with Discipline and a bonus track for those who are interested. The unusual guitar playing and bizarre vocal styles became trademark King Crimson of the 80s and are ground breaking, proving that King Crimson were alive and well in this new incarnation.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have basically dedicated my spare time over the past two months to devour all five books of the Game of Thrones series and like many of the other readers, I LOVED the first three.  Number four left me with a few complaints but luckily I could jump right into Dance with Dragons.  I can understand the complaints of many of the reviewers, but I don`t agree.  This is still a fancinating world, even if the characters don`t move as I wish they would.  At some point during Dance I realized this series is truly about playing the Game of Thrones and not about winning it.  At every turn your favorite hero is struck down but then so is the most despicable villian.  We despise the Lannisters but then almost start to root for them as the previous history is revealed so covertly...but only for a moment because then they disgust you all over again with their lack of character.  And while There was never a more honorable man then Ned Stark it seems like his family will never be reunited.  And what is Jon Snow's true parentage anyway?  He is a bastard we all know, but who's bastard?  Some part of me feels he is a stark by another parent than his father and maybe Rhaegar is his father.  I love the way so many stories are going on and I will not give up on this series. I can not see where it is going next but that is how the best stories are told?  In fact, this series reminds me of LOST.  I have faith that the creater of this world will not disapoint me and even if he does, it was an entertaining ride.
B00065MDRW|5.0|In The Court Of The Crimson King has become not only one of the most important albums of King Crimson but also one of the quintessential albums that spawned the progressive rock movement. Often quoted as the birth of prog rock, the album certainly encompasses all of the characteristics of the genre that we have grown to love: weird, jagged guitar licks, devastating drum time signatures that move outside the standard 4/4 rock signature, keyboards and mellotron pieces that balance the insanity, and all this punctuated by blazing blasts of saxophone that spiral out of control. In other words King Crimson at their best.<br /><br />The influences of Jazz are prominent throughout and the band are so tight the music tends to punch holes within the fabric of the musicscapes. An example of this is in the awesome '21st Century Schizoid Man'. This song introduced me to the band and I have never looked back, getting hold of any King Crimson I can, I am proud to say I have been Krimsonized. You have to love a band that uses music to express themselves the way King Crimson does. Greg Lake's vocals in '21stCSM' are processed through a vocal transposer that make him sound like some terrible alien machine that is telling mankind where he is going wrong: \\"Politician's funeral pyre, Innocents raped with Napalm Fire.\\"The lyrics are as potent as the Crim's can be. The feeling of alienation and a barren soundscape are exemplified in the way the song is structured. During the lyrics, a sense of minimalism is produced, then the wall of sound kicks in. The incredible sax and Robert Fripp's screaming guitar complement each other brilliantly throughout the opening half, and then it slows down for a moment before the time signature changes completely and there is an erratic saxophone that locks in and continues while a strange lead guitar howls and reverberates. One of the best things about this section is the way the music seems slightly off kilter, almost out of tune but not quite. There are moments where all instruments cease at once, pause and then begin on cue only to stop again in various rhythm patterns. It is quintessential listening for anyone interested in progressive rock.<br /><br />Following this maelstrom of sound, the album settles down surprisingly, for where else could it go, into a very melancholy type of song, 'I Talk to the Wind'. This features Ian McDonald's woodwind and the soft vocals of Greg Lake. To be honest, it's not one of my favourite pieces, it all seems so safe and tranquil in comparison to the rest of the album, but I guess as a contrast it works well enough. 'Epitath' is a great track that has been partly resurrected by Greg Lake on ELP's excellent live epic 'Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends' (the last few seconds on CD 1). It has a symphonic component that is created with a heavy blend of mellotron, keyboards and vibes. The lyrics are thought provoking \\"the wall on which the prophets write is cracking at the seams, upon the instruments of death the sunlight brightly gleams, when every man is torn apart with nightmares and with dreams...\\" this is where prog rock got its reputation for thought provoking lyrics. The stanzas are confusing, though enlightening and the lyrics revitalise the music, rather than detract. The two cannot exist without the other and are of equal importance. Peter Sinfield was responsible for some of the most provocative lyrics of the prog movement and he is credited on this album for 'words and illumination' interestingly enough.<br /><br />'Moonchild' is the longest track and annoyingly tends to just go on and on, almost as a complete improvisation in the studio recorded without forethought at times. I know this is one of the most annoying things about this band that I love, but it is also the reason that they are outstanding; they do improvise in concert substantially, and it has garnered their reputation for jazz fusion. So it's a catch 22 - if you are into a band as experimental as King Crimson there are going to be moments in their repertoire that will infuriate you. Michael Giles drum patterns are interesting enough but unfortunately, as far as I am concerned, 'Moonchild' is just about the worst they have recorded. It should have been cut by about 6 minutes and there is too little going on for my tastes to even make this memorable. It is more or less a jazz improvisation and doesn't really go anywhere. Maybe this is why some fans adore it.<br /><br />'The Court of The Crimson King' ends the album on a positive high note, although the album cover looks like the Crimson King is slowly being tortured to death. I absolutely cherish this song and it is one of the best prog tracks I have heard. Lake's vocals have never been better, and there are amazing flourishes of sweeping keyboards that send a chill down your spine. The sound goes from intense to very soft in waves and all is complimented by a stirring lyrical content: \\"The black queen chants the funeral march, the cracked brass bells will ring, to summon back the fire witch in the court of the crimson king.\\"<br /><br />On that note, in conclusion I will end this by stating the facts: if you care about the birth of progressive rock, if you like your prog jazzed up with a fusion of heavy mellotron, if you love saxophone interlaced with jagged guitar rhythms, if you have heard of this album but were worried to purchase it because it's so old, if you are into Emerson Lake & Palmer: look no further! This album encompasses all that makes prog rock so enticing, and in a sense it captures all that made King Crimson one of the leading progressive masters, brilliant but flawed geniuses.

1612930425|5.0|\\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long age. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\\"<br />This sentence is from the novel Pride and Prejudice, the most famous book written by Jane Austen. The author set the background as conservative and traditional British countryside life which still pay attention to the reputation and have their own social circle. It contrasts with the people who are upper- class. They are selfish and prideful. Through five middle class girls how to choose love shows the values of marriage in that time, in that society. But among them there still exists people like Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley who finally choose their true love. And the sentence expresses the true love in a class structure society is really cherished between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. It fully shows Mr. Darcy's love to Elizabeth.<br />For a long time, because of Mr. Darcy's pride, he hides his love to Elizabeth. It leads to Elizabeth has a misunderstanding to Mr. Darcy since the first time they meet. As the most important themes in this novel, love plays a special role in this book. The whole story develops around the different barriers in the true love and how people to respond these difficulties. And all of these difficulties come from one reason that is the social force. The social structure makes Mr. Darcy's pride that he feels like he should be proud of himself. Because he is richer than others and live in the upper- class. At the same time, it also the social structure makes Elizabeth's prejudice. She knows she and her family is just in a middle- class. So she is more sensitive than others and she does not want others such as Mr. Darcy looks down upon her. But just because of her sensitive, it makes her different from other girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent girl in her family. She is clever and high- hearted. When she first meets Mr. Darcy, she has a really poor impression about him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy and intelligent gentleman, so faces Elizabeth's prejudice; he chooses to be silent and does not explain anything. When he proposes to Elizabeth, Elizabeth determined rejects him and mentions Wickham's deceit. But Mr. Darcy still says nothing about it, the only thing he says is \\"I don't want to talk about it at all.\\" This is just one obstacle between them. Before they realize their sincerely love to each other, they have faced the different troubles and numerous stumbling blocks- Miss Bingley's snobbery, Lady Catherine's attempt to control her nephew, Mrs. Bennet's idiocy and Wickham's lies. All of these obstacles make a big difficulty exist in their love. Especially, the class- structure and reputation is more serious. The class- structure is really significant in that society. There are so many differences between them. They have the totally different life style since they were born. So from the origin of their mind is different. In the beginning, Mr. Darcy's pride to the people who live in the countryside hurts Elizabeth a lot. He thinks as girl as Elizabeth should be happy that he loves. Therefore, in the first time he says courtship to Elizabethj, he thinks she would love to say \\"yes.\\" But he gets an unexpected answer. And finally he knows Elizabeth in the only woman who loves him, not his money. So he helps Elizabeth's sister Lydia and Wickham, who is a fortune- hunting officer. And he explains all things through the letter from Elizabeth's aunt. He earned his love back. That proves love is a force that can be separated from social structure and facts and it shows love can conquer anything even the hardest thing- people's mind.<br />Reputation is another theme in the novel; it helps to strengthen the difficulty between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. For Elizabeth, reputation is not that important for middle class girl. She prefers to live with her family than cares about the reputation. So when she knows her sister Jane is ill, she walks to Netherfiled alone. She arrives with muddy skirt, to the shock of reputation- conscious Mass Bingley and her friends. She does not care how people judge her. In Miss Bingley's eyes, her behavior is absolute not acceptable in the upper- class. From Miss Bingley's reaction, it expresses Elizabeth's unique and her natural personality. But when sister elopes with Wickham and lives with him out of wedlock, the reputation- conscious happened again. Bennet family is not invited to the ball anymore, and even they walk as they run. Whatever Elizabeth does not care her reputation, but her family cannot avoid it. The social force still exists in her life. She cannot escape from it. But in her most difficult time, Elizabeth finds Mr. Darcy is the only person that wants to help her to find her sister back, give her sister money and solved all problems for them. She suddenly realizes she is wrong about her prejudice. So she decides to accept Mr. Darcy's courtship. They break the social structure and rules and finally get married.<br />This novel reflects how people treat marriage in that society. People only pursue wealth and reputation. Girls can marry with a guy such as Mr. Collins, only for his money. Parents pay attention to the man who their daughter will marry is rich, not whether their daughter really loves him. They pursue social position instead of love. But just because of that, it shows the true love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth is special and cherished. The author in this novel also tries to tell people, in this world we need to change, change can solve anything.

0385534639|5.0|As soon as I heard about this book, I knew I had to read it. Reading the book felt almost like unwrapping a present, starting out slowly and gently trying not to tear the paper, and finally giving up and ripping the paper off to find out what's inside. The book was just simply phenomenal. It seemed to start out slowly, and gather steam and draw you in further and further till I just couldn't put the book down. I read it in a week. It usually takes me about a month to finish a book.<br /><br />I did find the present tense took some getting used to, but by the end it made the book all that much more engrossing. It is extremely well written, and the high level of detail about the circus really makes you feel like you are there seeing it with your own eyes, experiencing what each of the characters sees and feels. Highly recommend!
B00065MDSG|4.0|Lark's Tongues In Aspic begins with Part One of the title track and we are immediately transported into the world of King Crimson: a world of jazz fusion, eclectic musicianship and wild virtuosity. In simpler terms - definitive prog rock. Glockenspial style bells are played, almost sounding like air chimes that you sometimes see outside people's homes that chime when the wind blows. But underlying this a strange twisted shimmering can be heard, and it's growing louder and louder. The bells cut out and the 'Psycho' style violin locks in as Fripp's tortured fuzz guitar blazes. The drums are erratic as ever and the sound is almost like a free jazz festival. The violin sounds similar to Van der Graaf's \\"The Quiet Zone/ The Pleasure Dome\\" in some respects, perhaps VDGG were influenced by LTIA.<br /><br />Cross, Bruford, Wetton, Muir and Fripp - a super group of immeasurable proportion and more influential to prog rock than most of the other bands the early 70s had to offer. This is experimental rock at its most profound. On every level the album causes us to question the function of music. There are lyrics, sung by Wetton, but they are subdued and overshadowed by the incredible instrumental prowess of the Crim's. There is even an oriental feel, with viola and mellotron. The dynamics of the album are second to none, moments of tranquil beauty, Cross's sparse violin, the true essence of minimalism, is punctuated by sudden bursts of jagged guitar and drums.<br /><br />Other tracks of note are 'Easy Money' and 'Exiles' but nothing compares to the end track, 'Lark's Tongues In Aspic, Part Two. This track features a killer riff that virtually tears through the melancholy nature of the track. Bruford's drums pound relentlessly sometimes without a discernible rhythm, at other times in the drums are in time to what is left of the beat that has been mangled by spurts of guitar and bass. It's a tour-de-force of verbal soundscapes that astound the ears and reinvent music as a medium for atmospherics: a sublime patchwork of electronica and rock carefully interwoven with visceral violins and percussion vibes. The remastered Lark's Tongues In Aspic is flawed in places but still remains a must purchase for 'Crimsonites' and prog rock fans alike.sublime patchwork of electronica and rock carefully interwoven with visceral violins and percussion vibes.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This 9 disc box set is definitely the ultimate series for all Star Wars addicts. If you do not buy the 9 disc box set there are no special features in the separate prequel and original trilogy boxes except 2 commentaries. These exact movies are available in this set in any case. The real drawcard though is the 3 bonus discs jam packed with special features and exclusive to the Complete Saga box set.<br /><br />Using innovative menus you navigate through each each movies and go to specific planet locations, view interviews, deleted and extended scenes, the collection of vehicles and costumes, and concept art gallery for each film. The special features are the best I have seen when it comes to documentaries including original never released 70s doco Making of SW, plus SFX doco on Empire from 1980. The Jedi creatures doco is one that I have never seen and there are new docos too, plus a science tech doco and Empire 30 years later.<br /><br />The 97 minutes of spoofs, satires and parodies is brilliant as you can laugh at all the satires of SW over the years in shows such as Robot Chicken, Simpsons, Family Guy, That 70s Show, Saturday Night Live, talk back shows, and heaps of others including fan films such as Troops.<br /><br />The deleted scenes from original trilogy are great to observe and very rare till now, many of which are legendary such as Luke constructing his light saber, Tosche Station scenes, Wampa attack at Hoth headquarters and the sandstorm from Jedi.<br /><br />The movies are all brilliant quality, and feature some added, rehashed scenes though not many. My conclusion is grab this if you are serious about Star Wars.

B003Y5H57Y|3.0|The Thing (2011) should have a different title because it is a prequel, not a remake. It shows what went down at the Norwegian's camp that Macready (Kurt Russell) and his crew investigated in John Carpenter's 1982 classic. You know, an alien is found frozen in ice that has the ability to copy other organisms and often twist itself into grotesque forms before killing someone. Unfortunately it is almost an exact copy of the last movie, but with weaker characters and hit and miss CGI. The nearly 30 year old practical effects blow away the SFX here, but they are not so horrendous that it ruins the whole experience. The best parts of this prequel are when the paranoia sets in and nobody trusts anyone. The cast is better than your average horror movie nowadays. Mary Elizabeth Winestead does a good job as the lead character, but nobody is developed enough to care about. I did like how the scenes during the end credits directly leads into Carpenter's The Thing. We even get a few of those eerie bass lines that brought so much tension all those years ago.<br /><br />Some will like it for being a companion piece to the 1982 film and others will hate it just because it doesn't achieve any level of greatness, or try to be anything other than a copy (ha, fits the theme of the movie) of what came before.<br /><br />On a side note, I always wondered what the true form of The Thing creature actually looked like. The alien that is frozen in the block of ice has claws and doesn't resemble something that could build such a huge and complex spaceship. My theory is that the \\"Thing\\" infected the alien crew of the ship on some planet and caused them to crash on Earth. Uh oh, I can see it now. The Thing vs. Aliens vs. Predators! The horror, the horror...

B001VEHZZ2|4.0|This is a brave, hard work showing the abyss that separates the West from Islam. At times a realistic narrative, Mohsin Hamid's novel veers into parable, with the narrator, the young Pakistani Changez, representing Islam and Erica, his white American girlfriend mired deep in a psychosis with self-destructive tendencies, representing the West.<br /><br />It is also the best one-sided dialogue since Daniel Quinn's Ishmael, where a seductively compelling voice carries you along through a story almost against your will.<br /><br />How does it end? There is a tension throughout the narrative. Who is the American Changez is talking to? Why does the waiter in the restaurant appear menacing? Hamid sets up a scenario of mutually assured destruction and leaves the reader the choice of outcome.<br /><br />The realistic portion of the narrative -- Changez's career in New York and budding love affair with Erica -- is sharply drawn and readily recognizable. A bright foreign student fits in so well that his colleagues can forget he is foreign and be blissfully unaware of the deep and different currents that run through him. It is the catastrophe of 9/11 that bring these hidden currents to the surface.<br /><br />There are some striking similarities to Netherland. Both stories involve foreigners who come to New York to work in finance. Both protagonists have their foreignness brought home to them by the terrorist attacks. Both end up going home. For all our globalized markets and economy, an individual's roots in culture and family will exert a pull in times of stress.<br /><br />Hamid's work is more radical, because Joseph O'Neill's protagonist in Netherland is European, with much more affinity for his host country. It is hard even with the most open mind to accept Changez's feeling of happiness at the destruction of the World Trade Center, but it's important to keep your eyes open and acknowledge the reality of it.<br /><br />I'll admit I had to check my globe to see where Lahore is located -- right on India's western border. That antagonism adds another layer to the book's conflict. It is not just Islam vs the West, but also against the vast Hindu state on its borders. Pakistan is as artificial a creation as Israel, a refuge based on religion. Oddly, Changez's description of the market, the tea, the food kind of make me want to visit Lahore.<br /><br />The author bio says Hamid, who grew up in Lahore and attended Princeton like his protagonist, now lives in London, which has become a mecca for diversity. Like other writers from the subcontinent, Hamid has a wonderful, flowing style that is somehow entrancing to read. I'll look for his earlier book, Moth Smoke, and for his next one.ism adds another layer to the book's conflict. It is not just Islam vs the West, but also against the vast Hindu state on its borders.

The author bio says Hamid, who grew up in Lahore and attended Princeton like his protagonist, now lives in London, which has become a mecca for diversity. Like other writers from the subcontinent, Hamid has a wonderful, flowing style that is somehow entrancing to read. I'll look for his earlier book, Moth Smoke, and for his next one.
1577314808|5.0|This book has been around without my knowledge! It was suggested I take a look at it & now it sits on my nightstand, travelled to Italy, been around in my car....it is where I am.  A bible in the sense that whatever paragraph I read it speaks to me & guides me in the circumstance I find myself in.  It is written so simply that a child could follow its lead and should.  If children get with this they will be better people as adults.  In the mode of change I am not who I was 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, and thank God for that!! I am heading in a more open minded, wider spiritual path, concentrated on my contribution to my life with others, acceptance of where they may be at the moment I meet them.  It is a wonderful way to live!!

030726999X|4.0|It's easy to say that the third volume in the most popular trilogy since Lord of the Rings is not as good as the other two. But it may actually be the one closest to Stieg Larsson's heart as he wrote about political corruption for a Swedish audience.<br /><br />Larsson, who died prematurely, presumably had no inkling that his saga of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist would become a runaway international bestseller, and this third volume is heavy with Swedish domestic politics. What was a simple detective story touching universal themes in the first volume becomes almost a roman a clef in the third.<br /><br />So it takes a certain amount of devotion to make it through the first half of this 600-page tome. One of the problems is that Salander is so little present. Another is the somewhat ponderous development of the complex plot. Larsson would have benefited here from the chance to work with an editor.<br /><br />However, once Salander is on the scene again and the laboriously established plot gains some momentum, the reader can cruise at high speed through the second half. Salander is as quirky and intriguing as ever, with that gritty integrity which makes her so admirable. Blomkvist and Berger are their flawed, narcissistic selves.<br /><br />There's much less discipline in this volume. The Amazon Monica Figuerola is an over-the-top fiction as Larsson indulges a highly personal fantasy. She's as perfect as a robot, with the same amount of appeal. Blomkvist's sister Annika Giannini, too, is always just right. Ditto for several other characters. The evil villains are perfectly evil. Prosecutor Ekstrom borders on pure satire and is somewhat entertaining as a result.<br /><br />But Salander and a neatly unfolding plot keep the reader's interest. The epilogue is not a throwaway and should really be just the last chapter, tying up the loose end that is so conspicuously dangling when the main plot comes to its conclusion. To call it contrived would be an understatement, but at least the loose end gets tied up.<br /><br />So I would probably rank the trilogy 2, 1, 3, with the second volume, The Girl Who Played With Fire my favorite simply because it keeps Salander at center stage for the most time. For its thriller quality, the first volume, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, is probably the tightest.<br /><br />Sadly, there will be no further adventures for Salander, nor any further thrills from Larsson's fertile mind. Not sorry to be finished with Blomkvist, Berger and Millennium -- they're all a little too smug and too full of their role as the guardians of Swedish freedom and democracy. What I will miss is Larsson's feeling for the profound corruption in society and its basis in personal corruption, the underlying current that moves these entertaining volumes along.<br /><br />What is Salander's appeal? Grit, yes; integrity, yes; an ability to cut through cant to the heart of the matter, yes. But I think at heart it's her vulnerability -- she is a victim who overcomes her hurt but remains vulnerable, literally to the last minute in this long saga. And her realization, at the end, but really throughout, that the only real protection is reliance on her friends.would probably rank the trilogy 2, 1, 3, with the second volume, The Girl Who Played With Fire my favorite simply because it keeps Salander at center stage for the most time.

B005I64U5C|1.0|Just like other reviewers the Digital Copy of this release is the WORST experience ever! You can't just download it to iTunes like almost all other digital copies. You have to go through this nightmare of setting up an account with flixter in order to stream to your phone or tablet device. Then when it gives you the option to download to your computer you have to download some adobe flash junk and it still does not allow you to move to iTunes. You have to log in to flixter to view it. I enjoyed the movie and the blu-ray looks and sounds great, but I am sending a clear message to the studio with my 1 star review. They need to include a iTunes digital copy not some hot mess release like this. When we pay extra for the digital copy we expect to work as it always has. So sad what could have been a 4 or 5 star review was messed up due to the HORRIBLE digital copy included on this.
1400079144|2.0|Dan Brown is an undeniably clever guy. He put together a mix of religion and esoterica into a serviceable thriller plot and got one of history's most widely read novels. He tries to reproduce the phenomenon in his new book, using patriotism instead of religion, and fails to get the mix right.<br /><br />For one thing, there is way too much esoterica. Long patches of dialogue read like Wikipedia texts, turning the novel into an encyclopedia of arcane knowledge. Layer on a Washington, DC, edition of Trivial Pursuit and you've got mystery nowhere near as potent as Jesus establishing a royal bloodline.<br /><br />The weakness of Brown's protagonist, Robert Langdon, becomes glaringly apparent in the absence of a riveting plot. A symbolist who remains a cipher, Langdon is almost totally devoid of personality, and is not even a two-dimensional character. It's appropriate that the bland Tom Hanks plays him in the films. Once again he has a female helper, but once again Brown shies away from anything like full-throated romance.<br /><br />Brown's compression technique -- having the action take place in a 24-hour period -- has been intensified to a 12-hour period, that defies credibility. One character who has survived torture, dismemberment and emotional trauma, instead of being in a state of shock, is blithely discoursing about arcane matters within minutes of his rescue.<br /><br />Personally, I like a lot of the arcane stuff, but this book is top-heavy with it and often repetitive. It is of course at the top of the bestseller list from pre-orders alone, and Brown has created a franchise that will survive this book and go on to another bestseller. But this is no Da Vinci Code and is really only mildly entertaining as a thriller.
B005I64U5C|1.0|When I ordered this, all it said was \\"digital copy\\" - and every other digital copy dvd I have ordered from amazon gave you a choice of versions and always one of those was itunes compatible. This let you download a legal copy of the move free from Apple and install on your computer, ipod, iphone, apple tv, etc - it was windows & mac compatible.  But now, there is a bait & switch here. This dics uses some new streaming ultraviolet which means it's NOT a copy at all. You have to stream it which means you have to be online PLUS it's not mac compatible. It says it supports the mac but I could NOT get it to load on any mac devices I own. What a rip off.  Shakes head, huge mistake Warner Bros. huge. I am returning this immediately. I know this isn't amazon's fault - but they should put pressure on the distributors to be more truthful in their advertising.  NOTE: Also, I just figured out (before packaging it up to be returned) that only the BluRay copy is the extended movie. The regular DVD and the Streaming version are the regular theatrical release. Wow... that's just... wow.
0981951244|5.0|I love the simple and timeless message in this book.  It is delivered clearly and he knows his subject.  This universal law of the compound effect is at work all the time--we have to consciously choose what we want to have compounded in our life.  Although I read it for business reasons I have also implemented it in my physical fitness journey and now a year later am really seeing and feeling the benefits of the compound effect of exercise!  Thanks Darren Hardy for reminding us in such a clear and powerful way.  Easy to read too!
0385534639|2.0|I love magic, I love circus, I was so looking forward to reading this book, but it just did not do it for me. Writing is beatiful on the technical side, but I did not feel that characters have had much substance, even Marco and Celia and I just did not buy in the strength of their connection.
0375507256|5.0|It's hard to describe the charm that David Mitchell exerts to draw the reader along in this odd book narrating six different stories in different periods. It is probably the voice in each narrative, so distinct, so different from the others in style and tone. Even the futuristic dialect of a post-apocalyptic world, which could have become simply ennervating in less skillful hands, captivates the reader. Not to mention the pre-apocalyptic but dismal future world where more brand names are generic (all cars are fords, all movies are disneys, etc.).<br /><br />The sheer imagination used in creating these different worlds, interlinked only in the most subtle way, helps carry the reader along. The individual plots, too, have their own suspense, plus, somehow, the suspense of seeing how these stories are linked.<br /><br />Thematically, Cloud Atlas glorifies independence of spirit in the face of a cynical and often cruel world. The protagonists triumph in greater or lesser fashion, but they preserve their integrity against often unspeakable corruption. If you subscribe to the theory that they are in fact each one the reincarnation of the previous one, then of course it is a single protagonist who succeeds in this endeavor over the course of centuries. But that is really a superfluous consideration, because each narrative stands on its own, and, related or not, the six protagonists show different ways to maintain integrity.

B005GVA2L0|2.0|All those great reviews I can't quite figure.  Many of the songs fall flat for me.  If this really is a big comeback, I will be surprised although another 2 million seller would be as good as you can imagine given the slumping CD sales this year.  For me the album still doesnt capture the glory of Fallen which was their magnum opus.  Maybe that's the problem, I can't help for Evanescence to measure up to that level again!  This CD is better than The Open Door but too much of it still seems boring.  The songs kinda run together and all sound the same.  But there are about 6 great songs including Secret Door.  I give the two stars for those songs.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|After reading some of the other comments I couldn't help but laugh at their so call &quot;opinion&quot;. To put it simply, people are dumb. The app itself is not bad. It could use some better editing ways but it's a paint game guys and it does exactly that, so if you don't like it because it doesn't have everything you want in a paint game then go design one yourself considering you must be a BA.
B004WJRF6C|2.0|I haven't heard the remastered version, but the version I have on CD, released on Capitol-EMI, is so bad, so poorly produced, so poorly panned hard left and hard right, and so difficult to listen to. No complaints about the songs - I love Paul for stepping out as big as he did on this record. BUT -  it was fine when I had the LP and a crappy set of stereo speakers, but, let's face it - this album was BADLY recorded and I'm not too sure any amount of remastering will do any good. The WHOLE THING NEEDS TO BE REMIXED! Then, remastered! Then re-released.

0307454541|5.0|It starts with the arrival of another mystery flower from an unknown source, one for each of his birthdays for over thirty years. And it ends with the answers to multiple mysteries but not that involving the Girl. Who is this girl with the dragon tattoo who has just spent many intimate months with Mikael Blomkvist tracking a killer, fighting her own demons, hacking financial accounts all over the world, and suffering as a victim of one of the worst crimes against a woman?<br /><br />The story in the middle weaves a mystery/thriller with journalist Mikael Blomkvist being retained to solve a decades-old murder. At the same time he is still reeling from losing his court case against Wennerstrom, and being sentenced to some jail time. This is not the last we will hear of Wennerstrom. And, the Girl, Lisbeth Salander, will play a big part.<br /><br />It's a complicated tale with multiple plots going on at once and the story switching from one to the other. This style is very satisfying to the more demanding reader who wants a great story and a challenge to their intellect. I like the ending where the main mystery is solved but then a secondary story continues. We are not ready to put the story down and this book delivers a very satisfying experience.<br /><br />This is not your normal formula book. It develops a couple great characters, and it opens your eyes to some of the abuse forced on women and on people with mental challenges. It does have some horrific scenes and some use of immoral behavior and bad language. However these are not just for the shock-effect; they do give you insight into the human condition and remind us, again, that there is real evil in the world and it takes brave, but maybe flawed people, to fight it.<br /><br />You might as well order the second book when you start this one because you are going to want it.<br />[[ASIN:0741420570 For Honor: An Adventure of What Might Have Been: Book One of By Honor Bound]]<br />[[ASIN:0741450607 Out of Phase: A Time Traveler's Chronicle (By Honor Bound)]]<br />[[ASIN:0741426935 Gambit: For Love of a Queen (By Honor Bound)]]<br />[[ASIN:0741440415 Righting Time: Book Three of By Honor Bound]][ASIN:0741426935 Gambit: For Love of a Queen (By Honor Bound)]]  [[ASIN:0741440415 Righting Time: Book Three of By Honor Bound]]
B001AG52AG|5.0|Amazing, moving, constantly entertaining...emotional.  The movie has a strong message of humanity conquering adversity with some gripping tragic scenes, some breathtaking cg sequences, and smart interesting characters.  The world itself is fascinating and the cg was well done.  This is not a kid's film...in fact I don't think it can be crammed into a particular genre which might be why it never found an audience.  However, the film itself is very important.  It's rare that you see entertainment of this caliber without a thousand obnoxious product placements.  The plot is genius.  It's a great film.  The only problem is it ends with a sequel in mind.  A sequel that sadly probably will never be made..still see this film.  It's great!

0131101633|5.0|I remember getting my hands on this book in about 1980 or 1981.  I and almost everyone I knew in the university computer \\"community\\" was busy at that time keying in the \\"hello world\\" program near the beginning of the book, and working on through the rest of the book.  I'm pretty certain that this was the first book on C ever written, and it was co-written by Dennis Richie, who wrote the C language.  He also co-developed the Unix operating system, but that's beyond the scope of this book - although the C language was written explicitly to write Unix in.  This I credit this book with really starting the real fire that the C language became.  Not only was the Unix operating system originally written in C (I believe the first OS that wasn't written in either assembler or directly in machine code), but today Windows, Mac OS and Linux are ALL written in C.  Obviously MacOS based on BSD Unix, and Linux, are fairly direct derivatives of Unix.)  This book is a true historical document for today's world, as well as STILL a great way to learn the C programming language (assuming that you already know something about programming).  I was inspired to write a review of this book - important to my own technical development as well as hugely influencing the world - after learning of the recent death of Dennis Richie, the father of the C language and co-author of this book.  It's a blow to have this luminary die just days after Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs greatly impacted our world, while a much quieter, reserved Dennis Richie actually had a much bigger impact on our world that Steve Jobs did.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|Basic fun doodling app.  Note:  SHAKE to clear all; back button to clear one stroke at a time.  There are similar apps out there with random brush styles as well as color, which I like, but this is good too.  The way in which you can change backgound color is cumbersome and a change in that process would make the app better.  One thing I really like about this one is that you can give your phone to your kids to play with and, unless they push a menu button, they can't accidently add or delete something while they play.  The app takes the whole screen and a gives kids a blank slate while keeping my screens safe.  Droidx.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger games triligy a 3 book series that has at least 100 deaths. I cant wait to see the Hunger games movie. It isn't a nessasaraly gory book, but every second you think the main character is safe her freinds die.  I almost cried a few times in the books. I read the 2nd and 3rd books in one sitting they were so good. I think Suzane Collins will be a billionare with these books. Watch out J.K. Rowling.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|I was fortunate enough to decide to watch this film on my own flight to Paris, and even more fortunate to stay in the same hotel the film was located and shot in. What a magical way to start my own vacation. The film did not disappoint. It starts out with a lovely wordless picture log of Paris to set the tone. Then what seems like a light fluff of a movie turned into a layered and intractate set of thoughts and ideas about life. Ideas including how prescious it is and how important the here and now is, as well as how important are the people we choose to spend our day to days with. Left with thoughts like was it real or was it imagined, there are lots of clues to lead a person both ways. I won't give them away. But be careful because Woody is anything but on the nose and the few hints he gives either way could easly be missed. I watched the movie a second time on the plane without the sound and enjoyed the visual experience with equal joy. (One of my tests of a great movie.) Then I watched the movie again on the way home, for the third time, and found even more little tidbits to enjoy and contemplate. Loved it, in case you can't tell. Can't wait to buy it and add it to my library when it comes out.

0811879542|5.0|This is a great book for children.  My 3 and 1/2 year old nephew made me read it to him three times in a row and only really stopped on a fourth time because his mom intervened.  I've purchased a total of 7 copies, 5 of which I have yet to distribute as Christmas presents.  The real draw is that it is an extremely interactive book, asking children to press on dots, shake the book, blow on the book, and more.  Other reviewers have already given great descriptions so I'll just add yet another opinion that this is a truly fabulous book that all kids should own.

It is truly a work of art -- the detail is overwhelming!<br /><br />I suspect there's more to the story of those who have trashed the film here because I just don't understand their reasons for disliking it so.<br /><br />I purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren, ages 8 and 10, and we viewed it together.  It was an enormous hit and, afterwards, we discussed the film -- the characters, the funny and the serious aspects of the plot and the workmanship that went into the presentation.<br /><br />There's more to Rango than just entertainment!

0240815807|5.0|A most excellent place to start your mixing, mastering experience.  Totally involving in that this book \\"Mixing Secrets for the small studio\\" by Mike Senior is easy to read and the information flows easily to the mind. This is the fourth book I have purchased and read on assembling audio to mastering. The third I purchased was Mixing Audio by Roey Izhaki which is also great.    As is my way I should have purchased this book many years ago however it was not written then so I already knew an amount of the knowledge written in the book. That aside I have found much to broaden my usage of the tools that I have in my well stocked studio. A \\"must purchase\\" is my view of this book, read it chapter by chapter when not tired and the knowledge within will make your studio time more fun, you will have better results and your results will come much more easily and quicker .  This starts off with getting your studio sounding as it should and the gear you should put in it to get sense from what you are hearing. So many of us wander around from product to product wondering whether what we are about to purchase will work and as normal we have little money and need to spend wisely. Well, \\"Mixing Secrets for the small studio\\" will give great indications of good gear from the start and gives confidence to purchase well. If I wrote more I would give away to much so I will leave this review here.  Highly recommended.  Bushboy

When I finally reached the last page, I looked over at the sun just beginning to rise on the next day realizing that I was so tired from reading through the night that I was probably going to be a mess for work the next day.  I did manage to make it through the day, and actually had a productive one at that because the book and the pleasure I got from reading it put me into such a good mood, I was energized and ready for anything.  In other words, my enjoyment of this book took on the same elements of enjoyment and stress that the characters experience in the book itself so that I could actually relate to the emotions as well as mental and physical fatigue they had to endure.  The book is thoroughly inventive, fast paced, well reasearched (or an illustration of neuroses - which I have no problem with) and rich in detail and character development such that it makes you care about them and their goals.  The storyline is complex in its depth and even more complex for those of us who actually get all of the quirky nostalgic 80's references.  I was so intrigued by this book that I googled the author and recognized immediately that he was born to write this book.  I just hope that he can equal this first one which has actually managed to make it onto my own \\"Scoreboard\\" (for those who have read the book)where I list my all time favorites.  And for an avid reader for over 4 decades, that is saying something.  Bottom line - don't hesitate, just read it and enjoy the journey!  Of course, it helps if you have a little \\"geek\\" in you.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|This app is one of the coolest free app of the day apps I've downloaded. The multi-touch function of it is completely amazing and allows for some really intense effects. I don't even have kids and I am definitely going to keep this installed and mess around with it regularly. It could do with an erase all button though.
B005KCTQSK|5.0|This expanded British version of Ellie's debut album Lights (which topped the UK album charts) includes seven extra tracks. Among the extra tracks you'll find her excellent cover of Your song, which inspired me to make a rare foray into the world of contemporary pop music, and which closes the album.<br /><br />The bulk of the album (everything except Your song) comprises original material, all of it written or co-written by Ellie, which I regard as danceable pop music. It isn't really like anything else in my CD collection but Ellie has a great voice that is easily heard above the music. Prior to Your song, Ellie's biggest hit by far was Starry eyed, but three other singles (Under the sheets, Guns and horses, The writer) also made the charts with varying degrees of success, while Lights became a minor UK hit following the success of Your song.<br /><br />Your song, Ellie's biggest UK hit up to that point in her career and which also charted higher than Elton John`s original, isn't typical of the album but that's OK. Being recorded without any electronics, but  just cello, piano, timpani and vocals, it is more typical of the kind of music I normally listen to and will therefore remain my favorite track, but I also enjoy the rest of the album and will follow Ellie's future career with interest.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|This processor is so much faster than my prior build, a Core i7-920, it's amazing. This puppy is almost as fast as the fastest $1,000 Gulf Town processor, for 1/3rd the price! It's performing flawlessly for me so far. I'm still playing with the overclocking, but some of my friends have gotten this chip up to 5.2 Ghz and beyond using just air cooling on the same motherboard I have, the Asus Maximus IV Extreme. I'm still playing around in the high 4s.<br /><br />The design of the Sandy Bridge CPUs appear flawless. I'm just bummed that they wasted all those transistors on a useless (for many of us), mediocre video processor.<br /><br />The \\"Cougar Point\\" P67/H67 Chipset problem is easily avoided. Just don't use the Intel SATA II ports on your Motherboard! No big deal if you have a good quality Motherboard with ample SATA III and non-Intel SATA II ports. How many people have more than 4 Optical and HDDs in their system anyway? The fellow who blamed the problem on the Sandy Bridge CPUs is entirely off base and unjustified...
B004L07KWQ|5.0|This is not just for kids. It serves as a great demonstration tool for showing off amoled screens like the one in my Samsung Epic 4G Touch. Love the black interface.
B005IY3CMQ|5.0|I listened this in almost one sitting, cause I'm so busy and important. Anyway i have been a Radiohead fan since...lets see, the first album i listened to...I Believe it was 'Ok Computer' then; 'Kid A', 'In Rainbows', 'The King of Limbs', 'Amnesiac' 'Hail to the Thief', 'The Bends', 'Pablo Honey.' In order from best to worst. And including the single album by Thom Yorke. I have the remixes in the special editions that include the remixes, but this one, this one. It is a Damn good remix collection. i expected it to suck like the remixes before but i am excited to have these discs. This album rocks and rolls and rolls again, I really hope they release this in Vinyl. All songs are original and not just putting their own little beat to it and voice part here and so on. Great beats and rhythm. Ho yeah! this is a keeper. Keep this or go listen to cold play or some other lower music.
0345529057|5.0|I bought this set because it was substantially cheaper than buying the books individually. I paid only $19.77. The books themselves are fantastic and, in my opinion, rival Lord of the Rings in their brilliance. Any fan of fantasy would enjoy this series. I actually ended up having to buy two of the boxsets so that my husband and I wouldn't have to fight over the books any longer! That being said, this box set is NOT a fancy one. The box it comes in is flimsy cardboard, and one of the two we received was actually ripped all the way through. So if you're looking for a gift for someone, this may not be the one to buy (although the books you get are exactly the same as the individual paper backs you can buy on Amazon for $10 each, so if you're aiming to buy the whole series, you may just want to buy this set and chuck the box it came in like I did).
B0052WSX32|5.0|Doris still has the voice!  She is delightful in this new album and I loved hearing some of her son's songs and hear him sing.  He has an excellent voice, too.  I cried at her tribute to him. I have been a fan for many, many years and was thrilled with this new CD.
1455510319|5.0|Well, there seems to be some organized protest going here against the electronic publisher of this book and the mob is taking it out on Connelly.  He doesn't deserve the bad reviews.  This is as good or better than the previous Lincoln Lawyer books, with lots of twists and suspenseful courtroom drama. I enjoyed it. If the prices are too high, wait a couple of years and find the book in a thrift shop--don't tell the publisher his business.
0439023491|5.0|I'm eating up this trilogy faster than I've eaten up a series in a long time. Once you start reading it's impossible to put the book down. There's always enough twists to keep it interesting, but not to the point of being unbelievable.
B0041KKYCY|2.0|First of all, let me warn you that this is no ordinary \\"thriller\\" or \\"suspense.\\" Steven R. Monroe' remake of the1978 cult revenge film is very violent with a lengthy rape scene that goes on and on. \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" is not \\"Kill Bill\\" where over-the-top violence is counterbalanced by dark humor and actions, and it doesn't want to be. Here the violence is raw and shocking, and it is meant that way.  The story itself is very simple. A writer from a city Jennifer Hills (Sarah Butler) rents a cabin in the woods to write a new book. She is attacked and raped by the local men. A month later she returns to them for ultimate revenge.   The film takes an extremely long time to show what happens to Jennifer, and like in a controversial French film \\"Irréversible,\\" the graphic violence is something that makes you feel very uncomfortable. Also, don't expect some social messages in the grindhouse-type film. Again, whatever the film is, it is not \\"The Accused\\" or \\"The Brave One,\\" but I think you already know that.  What disappointed me is the way the vengeful heroine distributes her own brand of justice. They are cruel - which is fine with me - and too elaborate, as if copying the tortures in the \\"Saw\\" franchise. Jennifer's transformation from a writer from a city into a killer who can create Jigsaw-like torture methods is not very convincing, especially after seeing the heroine's realistic rape and humiliation scenes. And ... how did she survive in the woods (without being seen) for such a long time?  \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" is a repulsive film. It is brutal and disturbing, but the real problem is that I cannot see the point of it at all.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was such a beautifully written story; I actually got teary and my heart ached.  It was one of those \\"can't stop reading\\" AND \\"wish it were longer\\" stories. Another bestseller for a fav author.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Works perfectly.  This device permits you to connect your Macbook to your TV using an HDMI cable and the mini sound port.  Viola!  Video and sound to your TV from your Mac.  Great device, which does get a bit hot, but otherwise works well.  The price is very reasonable for the connectivity provided.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|This is one of the worst sequels ever, really.  I thought this movie was going to be amazing lol I could barely finish watching it, it's awful.
B004GYY714|5.0|i use it to access local radio channels. works very well. some international channels also available but not very comprehensive
B000002UCN|3.0|I confess I'm not a Beatles fan, but I wanted to hear some of George Harrison's music after reading the essay in Rolling Stone. This album has the songs that I did like plus some of just Harrison's work that I'd never heard before. What was surprising to me was how \\"dated\\" the Beatles music was, this coming from someone who remembers their first appearance in the USA. Of course, even then I thought they were overplayed on the radio (remember what that was?) but still they had a lot of memorable stuff. This is a good album to have for the few I really love, like \\"Something\\", \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", etc. so I like this to have in my music collection, but not real encouraged to order any more Harrison. People did say there was too much Beatles, but I guess if you're a fan, this would certainly be in your collection. The one thing that stands out is how talented Harrison was in writing music, THAT will never be dated and will always be a part of music's life.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|This was as Great Series until Syfy (Why Syfy anyway i liked SciFi better) Canceled it. They recently Canceled Eureka, making the next episodes in 2012 the last ones.<br />Once I am done watching Warehouse 13, and Sanctuary and the last episodes of Eureka (probably all in 2012) I will be through with Scyfy they have canceled all the good shows and they will probably end up screwing the fans over and canceling those Warehouse and Sanctuary by their previous records of canceling all the other good shows.<br /><br />Scifi had it's hayday back earlier but now its all about paranormal shows, wrestling and other shows that I don't watch.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is awesome!   My wife who normally does not like card and board games really likes Catan. If you are going to play with more than 4 people make sure to get the expansion: [[ASIN:B000W7JWYG The Settlers of Catan 5 and 6 Player Extension]]. We even use the expansion with 4 people, as the board is much less crowded and the game goes quicker.   We have taught it to many people, and even though it is a little complicated at first they get the hang of it once a few rounds have passed.   Buy this game, you won't regret it!

B000ASATZ8|5.0|I just LOVE the Tremors movies, I don't care what anyone says. I was hooked on the first Tremors with Kevin Bacon, but I think that the second, third and fourth were fun too. Each one has a different theme and the Graboids keep mutating so that you never know how they'll turn up next. The fourth movie is really a Pre-quel that I hadn't even known existed, so it was fun too to see where it all started. Yeah, they might be a bit corny, but still they're just fun, a little scary at first and lots of humor to offset the grusome devouring of humans. This is a great set of all four movies, with closed captions so that I don't miss a single word.

B004O2HAMG|5.0|This is one of those movies that lives forever within you.  There will be many favorite lines you will repeat and friends will know they came from Lonesome Dove.  You will want a copy on your shelf to watch again and again.  Just the actors in it should tell you it's a classic.  You will feel fulfilled, satisfied and glad you saw it.
0439023513|5.0|Katniss is down to her very last straw. She has had enough of seeing people she loves get hurt or worse killed. It's now or never......<br /><br />What a way to end the series! I was just astounded at the bang Ms. Collins brought. This book was, just unbelievably good. I do feel terrible for all the suffering Katniss went through. She has just gone through so much!<br /><br />This final book in the trilogy was everything I expected. The characters, the drama, the writing, the plot....I could go on and on about this book. Everything was written to detail and just written perfectly. I can not even begin to explain all the gasping I  did while reading this. Ms. Collins you played with my emotions and I love you for that. Ms. Collins delivered an absolutely great read with such a great adventure.<br /><br />There were some parts I was a little angry at. But I don't think Ms.Collins couldn't have written it any other way. She ended this trilogy with hope and love.<br /><br />If you have not picked up this trilogy you should do so right away. This trilogy will bring you excitement, sadness, action, rage, love and most of all just a great read.

B0046E825G|5.0|Warning! Spoiler Alert!  I actually re-read Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer in anticipation of the movie release in November. I wanted the book to be fresh in my mind to make a good comparison between book and movie.  As I was reading I had to laugh at all the teen angst. I know the book is geared toward teenagers but it struck me funny (having lived through all that) about how serious young people can be about things.  The book is just as much of a page-turner the second time as it was the first. I could hardly put it down even though I knew what was going to happen.  In this fourth and final book of the Twilight series, eighteen-year-old Bella (the human) marries Edward (the vampire). Their honeymoon on a romantic island off the coast of South America is all Bella hoped it would be. Until - she gets very sick. She is dizzy, nauseated and can't keep any food down. Uh oh. She's pregnant. Not only pregnant, but very, very pregnant, very quickly.  Bella and Edward rush back home to Forks so that his \\"father,\\" Carlisle, can care for her, as he is a doctor. This pregnancy has everyone puzzled and confused. No one knows how to deal with a pregnancy from the union of a human and vampire. To top things off, Bella becomes more and more ill. It appears that the baby is killing her from the inside out. Jacob the wolf is nearby through it all and he comforts Bella as much as he can.  The baby, Renesmee, is born and as Bella is dying, Edward and Jacob rush to save her. Edward changes Bella into a vampire and then they can only wait as she suffers through the excruciating pain of transformation.  As a newborn vampire, Bella is thirsty and she is strong. Not only that, she's finally (in her words) beautiful. In an unexpected twist, Jacob \\"imprints\\" on Renesmee, meaning that he is bonded to her for life. Not everyone is happy about the idea but they grow to accept it. So, Bella's family is complete.  Complete, that is, until the Italian Volturi vampires plan to come to destroy the abomination called Renesmee. They mistakenly believe she is a newborn vampire child that must be eliminated instead of a half-vampire/half-human one.  Plans are made to gather other vampires to witness to the fact that Renesmee is not a newborn. A confrontation occurs, with the Volturi bringing reinforcements, as well.  The dramatic conclusion ends positively and everyone lives happily ever after. To me the ending is a letdown after so much tension and suspense. However, all questions are answered and Bella finally achieves the life she's always wanted.
B004JK61K0|3.0|This app is easy to setup but I never could find a way to change my pop account settings after the initial setup.  I personally expect these thing to be easy to find.  I went through every setting available after the initial setup and never found where I could change my password, or polling time, port, etc.  I uninstalled this app from my Droid X2.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|I took a few pictures of this and have found it to be a lot of fun. I even got some pretty positive feedback when using a picture from this on my Facebook picture. It is great, easy to use (see the effects in real time), and runs great on both my EVO 3D and my Galaxy tab. A keeper, and well worth the dollar.
0439023491|5.0|This is a great series of books.  The first one \\"Hunger Games\\" is already in the works for a movie.  I honestly don't read a lot of books, but I read this in about 3-4 days.  It well written and has a great story line.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I **RARELY** read a book until the series is complete. And this isn't expected to be complete for a very long time. I had actually bought the book because I thought I was going to see Brandon Sanderson at a convention and I wanted to get him to sign it. Since then, three other people have read it. It looks well read by now, just not by me. Good thing I got the hardcover.  But, wait, I'm reviewing the Kindle version.  Actually, I prefer reading on my Kindle, so I bought this one, too. And when all I hear is how good this book is, I had to break my rule and pick it up.  WORTH IT!!  I would put this on par with Sanderson's Mistborn series, except that I think this first book is stronger than Mistborn's first book (The Final Empire). I can't wait to see what comes out in future books.  I must admit, it started off a little slow for me, except for the opening scenes. When it got to the character development I kept wondering when the story would pick up. But he builds gradually to a mind-blowing ending to bring full-circle most of the main plot points. And, like every Sanderson book, uncover the hidden gems that lie hidden throughout the novel. He is good at adding twists and I think he does it better than anybody else.  Highly recommended, even if you have the same rule as myself. I can't wait for the second book. The mark of a good book is to leave the reader wanting more. Well, I want more!!! This is going to be a great series!
0375842209|5.0|Brilliantly written and absolutely captivating.  One walks through Germany during the Nazi uprising, along with Liesel and her best friend.  We watch the rise of anti-Semitism through the eyes of a child who has seen too much already, in her young life.  We also learn that words possess the power to heal, grow and propel us forward.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|At first I didn't get why you couldn't choose a color and why it chose it for you, but then I realized that this is something just for kids. Little ones, those who just want to see stuff appear on the screen but aren't so interested in having the correct color in places. Sure enough, when I let my nieces and nephews play with it they didn't want to put it down. If you have little kids, or are around them, then this app is certainly for you.

B002ZG994U|4.0|This review has minor spoilers under Best Dialogue so read that part if such things bother you. This is remake/refresh of the TV series of the same name, focusing on a group of specially trained ops who are betrayed and need to clear their name. There are some lines and phrases that are nods to the TV series. The humor was surprisingly good in this picture. There's lots of action and some interesting twists though a few were easily predictable if that turns you off. Overall, I'd say this was a fun film though purists of the TV series may be disappointed. Jessica Biel has a supporting role. A comic book and IPhone app came off of this picture. This film received mixed reviews from critics and the original cast. More importantly, it cost $110M to make but the box office only yielded a bit over $177M. Because of that it's unlikely there will be a sequel even though most of the cast was open to such a possibility. HUMOR: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early October 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; BEST DIALOGUE: Sgt.

0385344325|4.0|\\"So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, 'We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.'\\" -- Luke 17:10 (NKJV)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It chronicles how Reacher became the fascinating civilian we know from earlier books in the series instead of an MP. A major part of the book's charm is seeing how Reacher handled the upper echelons when he reported to them. It's a new view of the Army that will fascinate you, I'm sure.<br /><br />I would love it if Lee Child would write dozens more books about Reacher in the Army. That would be terrific!<br /><br />The book's main weakness is that the plot is a little too transparent and some elements are over exaggerated.<br /><br />But it's definitely a lot of fun!

0316069884|5.0|What can I say about 'Eating Animals'. Most everything in the book, I already knew, unfortunately.   This should be REQUIRED reading for EVERYONE who eats meat, fish or poultry. Our meat doesn't come neatly   packaged, in the meat case. These animals suffer and suffer horribly!!! They are not always dead when they are being skinned and thus are literally skinned alive. The conditions they 'live' in are deplorable. Something needs to be done about Agra-farming. These animals are so pumped full of chemicals and antibiotics, it's no wonder we have super bugs today. It's no wonder people get sick, it's no wonder you can no longer eat raw cookie dough or cake batter, with eggs in it...the eggs are full of salmonella. This book is so well written, it is in no way boring. All I can say is get a copy and READ IT!!! Have your eyes opened to where your meat comes from and just how the animals are raised and slaughtered.

B003CN4R74|1.0|I really wanted to like this album, being a big fan, but . . . too much Amy.  Now, I love Amy Lee's voice which is one of the all time rock voices which made the first album ground breaking! She's great at the 'tortured' style and at this stage of her career, I was hoping for more variety.  I listened to this album 4 times before I rated it at one star (I started with 3 out of 5).  Here's why:  Most of the songs are mid tempo with the same torture lyrics and voice (again, a GREAT voice), but Amy's singing throughout the entire songs.  One guitar solo on the album which lasts about 10 seconds.  Yes, the staccato guitar bursts are there, but is this rock or opera?  I wanted this album to be a great rock album, but the lack of guitar solos makes it redundant because I need a break from the vocals.  Even, some percussive breaks or the orchestration which they piled on these songs would have worked.  No orchestra solos, just a lone piano break here and there.  Somebody down there at Blackbird studios (one of the best in the country) should have put the reins on the vocals. The orchestration is way overdone.  The album is 'over produced' and loses it rock edge.  Maybe, this was the intention.  Maybe, the guitar guys were afraid to solo thinking that it's all cliche?  Not in rock. baby.  I would have loved to hear some male vocals harmonizing with Amy.  Who knows, maybe her backing band are good singers?  It's a stretch, but live, this band would rock.  Live, all you're gonna get is Amy singing with no guitar solos or breaks.  The constant vocals get boring but, with more balanced arrangments, having solos, breaks, etc. - when that voice returns in the songs - what better impact it would make.  Also, the album art is boring.  The front title should have been bigger.  The back CD artwork is plain and it's hard to read the titles - please, next time, number the tracks.  The fonts inside are way to small (a trend on all CDs).  The few good things I hear are:  great vocals, good production, intersting lyrics.  Again, it's the same 'mood' throughout the CD and I would have loved better songwriting with more variety:  some thrash, maybe a blues based song, some rock and roll (remember that), some metal, something upbeat and positive.  I listen to music to escape, but don't want to escape into a depressing world - one in which I already live in.

006112429X|1.0|This is the most disturbing book I've read in years.  At first I found the story fascinating, but as the novel developed the less I liked it. By the end of the book, I hated it.  I think it was written to shock and not to edify.  Shriver has a very bleak view of human behavior and mankind in general. There is nothing wrong with this in the hands of a true artist.  Shriver is not one those.  The critical reaction is completely over the top. It has won an award or two.  The book is a pageturner no doubt but in the end it is a gothic horror story in the tradition of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Shriver's sympathies are not with the victims of Kevin's murderous impluses.  She seems to think they deserve what they get.  The book does not have an artist's insights.  It is for the reader who likes his gore very graphic. It is PSYCHO told completely from the point of view of Norman Bates and his mother.  So in one sentence, Shriver is a master of vulgar gore.  Read at your own risk.

The reviews discouraged me from buying the album here, but if you listen to the preview for Laid to Rest you can hear for yourself that it is not edited.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|The Beatles will always be around. Although they have lost half of their group, this album takes you back to the happy hey-day they created. Some songs will always bring a tear- of joy,love lost and going onward. These songs can't help but change your day or your whole day.There's not a song you want to 'skip' past.
B004ZH66XO|3.0|I really like this game and my  2.5yr old LOVES this game.  However, why are there no updates on the version purchased from the Amazon market?  The Android Market has an update released on Oct 8th w/ new levels.  I purchased from the Amazon appstore and apparently I can't get it.  Why? Why? Why?  What kind of sense does that make?  I apparently need to purchase it again from the Android Market to be eligible for updates.  :\  I'd love it if you could fix this issue.  I'd happily have given more then 3 stars if the updates worked.  Otherwise I'll need to spend another $2.  Thanks!

B004EPZ08E|1.0|There is no digital copy downloadable into iTunes or your PC; the links don't work for \\"UltraViolet\\"; and \\"streaming\\" is not a \\"digital copy\\" anyway.

I'm returning this piece of garbage \\"package\\" and getting just the Blu-Ray version.
0553801473|4.0|I was unhappy with the long wait before Dance was finally released, and I was not going to continue with the series.  However, after 4 weeks, I gave in and bought the book, and I'm glad I did.  I actually enjoyed the slower pace and feeling at home again in Westeros, and also enjoyed the new points of view such as Victarion (very funny) and Barristan. It was also good to hear from Tyrion and Jon Snow again.  I was surprised by the Cersei storyline; it was almost heartbreaking it was so lovingly written.  The Dany storyline was OK, but it could have been cut back.  I liked this book better than Feast, although it looks as though I am in the minority with that opinion.  It is not in the same league as SOS, (which I would give 5 stars), but I'm not sure I would like that level of intensity and fear in every book. For me, every book in the series has its own purpose and personality and this book gave me a lot more enjoyment than I was expecting based on all of the poor reviews.  I still love this series and will continue reading as long as there are books to be read.
0451232577|4.0|I wish all you people who are just complaining about the price of the books would just take your complaints down to Occupy Wall Street. The people who want valid opinions about the book from people who have read it, use this venue to make a judgement about buying the book for it's written content, not it's dollar value. If you are upset with the price, don't buy it, but don't corrupt the rating of the contents with all this moaning about the price. I suggest you wait 2 years and buy it used, it will still have the same content and you will have nothing to complain about. It is the same thing over at Amazon, and they use a five star rating system so it is even more difficult to make a decision without wading through all the price complaints for the valid literary reviews by earnest readers.

B00454U1NS|5.0|I work out regularly and it helps to have some cranking music to help with the motivation. So I'm constantly looking for something new and fresh that hits the spot.  Genre does not matter, so long as it's upbeat.  This certainly hits the spot.  The weights nearly move by themselves!
B0053F042G|4.0|I thought this was a really clever action movie, like the psychological thriller version of Groundhog Day. It had some interesting twists, which almost put me in mind of the video game \\"Assassin's Creed.\\" Keep your eye out for the product placement... it was everywhere! It had a couple of loose ends, but it's still an enjoyable ride.

It was rated as \\"in good condition\\" when I purchased it, but when I pulled it out of the shipping envelope, the case looked really old and damaged. The cardboard movie cover looked like it had water damage and was stuck to the plastic case. I had to spend 5 minutes getting it off, tearing it in the process, before I could even open the movie case. The disc was floating around inside when I finally got it open.

B0009VPFSW|5.0|I was having trouble finding CF cards to use with my used NEC Mobile Pro 900.  The machine is 10 years old and most modern accessories are not compatible with it.  The NEC will only accept a CF type I and it needs to be no more than 8 gigs in size...and I was told even smaller was better.  Since I was going to be transferring text files in and out of the machine, a 512mb is ample size to hold my files and I found that this card is compatible with my Pocket PC.<br /><br />I've been using this CF card for six months and so far I have had no issues.  When I use it, I do remember to eject the card from my desktop before removing it and this, I feel, has helped to prevent my files from corruption.  I also configured it to FAT 16 before I used it for the first time.<br /><br />I think you will find that this CF card will work well with whatever older model of device you are using it for and I can recommend it as a well made CF card.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|a goofy doodling program for someone much to young to own the device it runs on ;) worth the price I say.

B005GVA2L0|3.0|I am actually disappointed in this new album, its completely different musically in sound, a lot of the songs sound the same, the guitar is rockin, but the vocals are repetitive, I am the biggest Amy Lee and Evanescence fan and was really looking forward to this release, its not horrible just not Evanescence, not the darker sound were used to, maybe she's just bored with the old sound but her fans aren't
0439023491|5.0|By the Pink Panther,<br />I have read quite good and well-written books in the past five years, and everyone is written the same way as the last, but Catching Fire caught my attention with the first book. It was an unpredictable book with lots of cliffhangers at the end of most chapters. I cannot relate to the people in this book, but can understand their emotions completely. Even though I don't relate to most of the book, I can relate to a family member that was close to you that dies.<br /> Catching Fire takes place in Panem, the future America. Panem is a county divided into twelve districts, thirteen districts before the \\"dark days\\". The government lost control of the people and a war began. It was a long war, but the government eventually prevailed. From then on, to remind people of the government's power they would hold an annual \\"celebration\\" every year called The Hunger Games. The Hunger games is when a random name of one boy and one girl between the age of twelve and eighteen will be drawn at a ceremony, and those two children will have to fight each other for survival. Twenty-four children are thrown into an arena and must fight for survival, until one boy or girl is left. Catching Fire is the second book in this series, and a good heir to the first one at that. It takes place in Panem after Katniss Everdeen has won the seventy-fourth Hunger Games with the boy who went with her, Peeta Mellark, under the exception of the rules. They must take a victory tour to all the districts, and keep up their fake relationship, because if they don't convice the president of their relationship or he will start killing off anyone in relation with them. That is before a surprise is thrown in their way, threatening both of their lives.<br /> This is the book is and emotional rollercoaster. It brings out every emotion imaginable. As soon as you realize what one emotion your feeling is, you are hit with another one. If I had to choose the four most frequently felt emotions I would say sadness, relief, joy, and anger. Catching fire is truly a wonderful book, alongside the Hunger Games and Mockingjay.<br /> There are probably many books out there that are similar to this one that I have not read, but there is one that I would consider very similar. That book is The Rangers Apprentice, mainly because it is a fast paced book with a deep storyline where the writer makes it look effortless to come up with new ideas for the book. Like Catching Fire, The Rangers Apprentice is a multi book series that was written very well by the author. The main difference for these books is their time period, because Catching Fire is a book based in the future, while The Rangers Apprentice is based in the past. If you liked Catching Fire, you will love The Rangers Apprentice, because of the similarity of the characters and their motives.<br /> I liked this book from the start! After the first chapter I was sucked into the District 12 of Panem. When I think back to two scenes in particular, I realize that we are blessed that that is not how our government works. This is a book that teaches the blessed, how blessed they really are. It is for sure on my top 10 list of books I have ever read because it involves you. When I first bought the book at Barnes and Noble, I thought it looked pretty violent and cruel, but after I read it I am glad that I got it. I would recommend for anyone over the age of 13 to read this book, because I know that if I read that book when I was ten, I would have thought it was a horrible book. Though, by the time you turn 13 you should like this book. That is why I strongly recommend this book.would say sadness, relief, joy, and anger.

1118026470|5.0|There's a running joke we have on our assessment team about the Web Application Hackers Handbook. Every time we see a new technology, or have to deal with a one-off situation, we start doing research online only to find it was already referenced in WAHH somewhere. We've all read this book several times too, it's like Dafydd and Marcus sneak into our houses at night and add content...<br /><br />Joking aside though, there is no other reference for web hacking as thorough or complete as WAHH.<br /><br />With WAHH2 the authors added a significant amount content and rehashed existing chapters that were already deeply technical. The bonus in WAHH2 is its associated labs. Dafydd and Marcus have been giving a live WAHH training for years and have now moved the stellar CTF like challenges to the cloud. You can buy credits ($7 for 1hr) and move right along as you read the book (MDSec.net). When I say the labs are stellar, I mean it. The labs come almost straight from the class and start trivial and then get crazy. The injection labs were by far my favorite, housing 30-40 different injection types/variants each between XSS/SQLi. The CTF in the class (which i'll mention again is where the MDSec.com labs are based from) gets ridiculous toward the end. Even seasoned web testers fall around questions 14-16. But i digress...<br /><br />WAHH2 is now the defacto buy for any pentest/QA/Audit team. Its usage will surpass any other book on your bookshelf if you are doing practical testing.<br /><br />5 stars, i'd give it 10 if I could.
B004LWZW42|5.0|The movie was great except it didn't follow the other movies , such as in XMEN WOLVERINE at the end they showed the professor standing up, he was older, and had a bald head, so one assumes that he hasn't been paralyzed yet, but in the new movie he was paralyzed when he was a young man with a full head of hair.  There are other things so small not even worth mentioning.  Even with all these things, I still believe that it is one of the best XMEN movies in the series!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|it is a lot of fun and also challenging to finish with three stars. I love palying it whenever I have a few minutes to blow. it loads quickly.
B005I64U5C|3.0|Unlike earlier movies, the digital copy that comes with this one cannot be downloaded to iTunes. Instead you have to install a new application (Flixster Collections), set up two new Web accounts (with Flixster and Ultraviolet) and download the movie to that instead. This means you can't copy your movie onto your iPhone or iPad until new apps are available for those. Very annoying. I'm guessing this is WB effort to get Apple out of the loop but from a consumer perspective its a bad move that requires you to use multiple incompatible applications to manage your digital media collection and limits its use. I won't be buying any more BD+Digital Copy discs until this is reversed.
0441018866|5.0|Hard Sci-Fi novels sometimes gets a bit caught up in its own trappings - this is not one of them. What is exceptional about this book is the amazing depth of character and plot that evolve in step with the unique environment. Some really original sci-fi stuff and a story that had me reading non-stop. An excellent offering - 'Shatterlings' cloned from a single source millions of years distant must fight to survive a genocide that can only be attributed to a veiled sub-culture known only as the 'House of Suns'. Their tense struggle will reveal new depths to their past and new opportunities for their future.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Plenty has been said about this new studio release from our beloved ProgGods so I'll just add a few sentences to the fan chorus.  Fly From Here is a recommended recording which showcases YES in great spirits and compositional shape. The production is simply perfect and the new singer's contribution a good one though his voice is certainly not the focal point of this work... and that is also good.<br /><br />While Fly From Here, the song, is by all means the center of the album, I find myself listening to \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\\" repeatedly.  The production of the song is impeccable; absolutely gorgeous arrangement and equally gorgeous singing/melody by Chris Squire.  I wish there were more songs with him at the center.  His song \\"Can you imagine\\" from the \\"Magnification\\" album is another of those beautiful Chris Squire moments.  Long live the man.<br /><br />\\"Hour of Need\\" is another winner and Steve Howe shines here providing an exquisite folksy accompaniment.<br /><br />One minor complaint:  I find Alan White's drumming too laid back - possibly just a sign of physical aging - but at least his musical refinement is certainly there, intact.  One track that calls for a more visceral drumming is the excellent closing track, \\"Into the Storm\\".  Alan White's contribution there is merely polite; a complete juxtaposition to what the rest of the ensemble is doing.  In spite of this, I regard this record in very high ground and highly recommend it.  Let's hope there are at least a couple more records like this one left in them.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I'm sure Lark Rise To Candleford Season One is not perfect, though I see the word \\"perfection\\" being used again and again in other amazon reviews. It is the best period series of this type that I've ever seen. It's beautiful to look at, well-written, top-notch acting, engaging dramas and situations mostly appropriate to the time and place.<br /><br />Frankly, I can't find anything to criticize about it. It's a delight. Perhaps it IS perfection, after all!
B004L07KWQ|5.0|App does exactly what it says. Not good in my opinion, but if this was something someone was looking for it, it hits the nail on the head.  Hate when people cry about what the app &quot;should&quot; do and they aren't rating the app for doing as it describes. Also, your personal life has nothing to do with the quality of an app, so don't down rate based something that had nothing to do with the app.

B005GVA2L0|4.0|Started checking in to the release of the cd a few weeks back. I'm one who wants to know what i'm getting before putting my money down. The deluxe disc set has I believe 16 songs {forgive me I don't have the disc in front of me}, compared to the regular with 12.<br />  Amy's voice is great as usual but most of the songs seem like she really did'nt change much of a tone in them Her usual gothic sound kinda got old by track 5.<br />So much talent but they needed more of a mix up of up beat material. Out of the 16, I liked about 6, maybe 7.<br />The very best were the extra tracks 13 thru 16!<br />as for the second disc a dvd forget it. Was of time and money. Its almost all talk. About how this was done and the video for that was done. Just something to get you to spend more money.  To me All cds should have at the very least 15 tracks and should be atleast over an hour long. Unlike so many artist giving us 10 and 12 tracks for a time length of MAYBE 40 to 45 minutes. What a rip for the big money we pay.<br />Then you usually get maybe 3 or 4 good to decent songs .  I searched 9 on line stores before i ever found one where you could actully hear the 30 second takes of the songs. Found that and the best price at Kmart.com

B005BO2L9I|5.0|The autumn leaves are falling, you go to work in the dark and return in the dark and the winter chill seems poised to enter our lives. Why not therefore get a final blast of summer before the permafrost descends by purchasing this vibrant feast of Malian music from the brilliant Fatoumata Diawara who recently stole the show on Jools Holland. Hailing from Southern Mali and singing in her native Wassoulou language, Diawara determined to make it as an actress in Paris but found that the draw of music proved a far stronger primal urge. The loss to the Thespian profession is music lovers massive gain since \\"Fatou\\" is a stunning record full of colour, verve, rhythm and excitement. It is one of the best African music LPs you will hear but it is also much more than that. The swirling melodic guitars of this record combined with the multilayered vocals show a real soul/funk sensibility at work combined with lyrics which we are told pulse with the concerns of social justice not least denouncing arranged marriage and female circumcision. What some might see as a language barrier in terms of lyrical understanding actually adds to the sheer beauty of the record since it makes for an entrancing backdrop and the musical force of the songs carries all in their wake.<br /><br />The laid-back funky opener \\"Kanou\\" is a fine start with its hypnotic vocal and pulsating bass interwoven with gentle acoustic guitar lines which dance around the song like a summer breeze. The second song in is \\"Sowa\\" which is irresistible and hugely commercial, indeed it is surprising that Western singers are resisting the temptation to draw inspiration from this deep well. One song which might just be the \\"first amongst equals\\" in album of standouts is \\"Bakonoba\\" which David Byrne would have died to record in Talking Heads and which draws in music from across the Atlantic in terms of the intoxicating mix branded with the label AfroCubism. It is utterly infectious and the African guitar playing the best this side of Tinarwaren . The mood quietens for the sumptuous guitar ballad \\"Alama\\" which was such as show-stopper on Jools Holland where you can see the elegant Diawara in all her glory. Another song \\"Willie\\" also plays to the more tender side of Diawara and the sheer emotion and range of Fatoumata Diawara's voice demonstrates a force of nature at work. The good old Daily Telegraph has described Diawara as \\"the most beguiling talent to hit the world music scene in some time\\". On the evidence of the entirety of \\"Fatou\\" and songs such as the brilliant closer \\"Clandestin\\" we are seeing yet another music artist from Mali poised for world domination which would be just reward for one of 2011's best albums.Tinarwaren .

I wonder if the publisher rushed this particular volume to production or if the idea wasn't as fleshed out as usual?

B005IS565S|5.0|A great album to have for knuckleheads and hard rock/metal fans alike.      For returning FFDP fans curios about the album, buy it! You will not be disappointed. All the heavy hitting riffs from Way of The Fist and all the more melodic mix of War is the Answer makes it back for an even better 3rd album. I am not let down by a single song off this album. One song you want to go crazy and start a middle of the street mosh pit and the next song youll be singing your heart out. Some songs you want to (and probably will) do both.  To any open-minded music fans looking for a new band to listen to, I suggest you pick up this album. Its got just about every side of music you could ask for. Heavy, Melodic, fast, slow, from 80's style ballad hits to the new standards of metal. Its all there.  Five Finger Death Punch has been able to turn heads and attract ears from the start and this album only adds to show their amazing abilities as musicians and song writers.

0743297334|5.0|Ernest Hemingway's novel \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" creates a sense of passion in the reader's perspective by using dramatic emotion to portray the characters senses, while effectively creating a set that is believable and accurate.  Hemingway uses alcohol in the novel, as a way to create this emotion and mix it with imagery that ranges from sharp to blurry to depict the scene.  The different sets create a world that is realistic and yet free from the mundane.  With bustling fiestas, to flowing streams and mountain valleys, Hemingway lures the reader into his own world of love and lost.   The beginning of the story starts out with a character description of the self made man, Robert Cohn.  It takes the first few chapters to really describe Cohn, but without them the reader would be lost later in the novel.  The story then turns to the relationship between Jake and Brett, two main characters who have had a relationship in the past and still love each other.  The passion that is seen between these characters is the main focus of the book, showing how two broken hearts deal with the pain in different ways.  Whenever Brett is alone she goes to Jake and they put themselves through the pain all over again. However, when they are finished Brett runs off with another man when really she could only be happy with Jake.  On the other hand, Jake uses alcohol to deal with his pain until Brett comes back to him.  This is the only time that Jake feels like himself, when Brett is with him breaking his heart, or when he is completely drunk.   Imagery becomes the focal point in Hemingway's settings by creating worlds and filling them with his experiences.  He uses adjectives that make the reader feel as though they are a part of the scene, standing in the crowd amongst the people.  Jake and Bill, another main character, take a detour before going to a fiesta to go on a fishing trip.  The detail that was put into this scene makes it possible to see inside of Hemingway's mind, picking out what he wants the reader to experience.  When someone reads this, who knows something about fishing such as myself, they will find that it is extremely accurate and descriptive, not to mention exciting and full of life.  Hemingway turns scenes that would normally inform, and makes them into inspirational stories of success and grandeur.   The last scene of the novel is a fiesta created by Hemingway to stir the senses of the reader.  The detail that he puts into the party makes it seem like the reader is inside the story sitting at the bar with the characters.  Unlike many other authors, Hemingway did not leave the reader out of anything, from drinking out of homemade wineskins, dancing in the streets, and the famous bullfights, he produced it on paper as a director produces a movie.  Even the little things such as tables and chairs become objects of creativity, \\"The marble- topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone, they were replaced by cast iron tables and severe folding chairs.  The café was like a battleship stripped for action,\\" (Hemingway 153).   The passion and creativity that Hemingway puts on paper creates a sense of emotion that enthralls the audience.  The style that he preforms in the novel sets the stage for emotional build-ups and creative conclusions.  The ability to include his reader in the novel is another plus to the totality of his creative talent.  Hemingway's style creates such a vivid world that only the characters themselves know what they're missing.
B005F3XV7Q|3.0|If Kevin James sticks to making these Happy Madison movies, he'll probably have many movies where he literally plays the title character, like the Eye Doctor, the Ice Cream Man, the Mud Wrestler, the Fat Man in a Little Coat or the Hotdog Eating Champion. But the funny man, once again shows here that he can do better.<br />  Attractive and talented actresses always do Happy Madison films \\"for some reason\\", Rosario Dawson (Clerks 2) is the latest but she surprisingly shines. Surprisingly, since the women characters are usually one dimensional and especially don't get to do much in an Adam Sandler movie.<br />  While Sylvester Stallone, Cher and Nick Nolte do good jobs in voice roles for animals. I'm not sure what Adam Sandler was going for with his Jewish old man voice....for a monkey though, his voice acting is awful. While despite being PG, the story is pretty adult and just about dating and the James character even gets a lot of love advice from the animals. Still, grown-ups might enjoy the film, that is if they don't put it on for their kids since a lot of the jokes are geared for adults.
B004TTHDAI|5.0|I so enjoyed Rosamund lupton's novel - SISTERS, and couldnt wait to read her next offering. AFTERWARDS is even better, I could not put the book down. The author has a rare gift - I cannot wait to read her next novel.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I love this game, fun and challenging, a great game that you have to think about to finish, a challenge that f***king Angry Birds can't provide
B005I64U5C|1.0|I know some people are already commenting on the Digital Copy issue with the movie which is horrendous not to mention a security issue that I am trying to address with Amazon not to mention the Wi-Fi requirement. The other issue is the Playstation download of the Batman/Sinestro suit for Arkham City. There is NO code on the back. It has the insructions but no code. Amazon's response is just to return the DVD and they will send another but that does nothing to solve the issue of the digital copy nor does it help with the code for the game. Does anyone know another place to get this with a genuine digital copy and that might NOT have the issue with the Playstation code.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a great, fun puzzle game. The atmosphere is fantastic, well worth the money paid. Simple and challenging.
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|I've been an AC/DC fan for over 30 years and looked forward to Black Ice after an 8 year absence by the band.  And I'm really glad they released it.  There are some real gems on this albums, new additions to the Family Jewels.  But to include 15 tracks on the CD, even after a long absence, is too much.  I tried to convince myself that this was a tight album worth listening to from beginning to end, but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't buy my own propaganda and had to admit that there were too many fillers.  The ideal Black Ice, which I compiled for my personal listening, is:  1. Rock N Roll Train    2. War Machine  3. Spoilin' For a Fight   4. Stormy May Day   5. Rock N Roll Dream    6. Rocking All The Way  7. Black Ice
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Evanescence are back and better than ever. The album is great its diffrent from fallen and the open door and in my opinon lost in pardise is there best song on the album. People are critersizeing the album because its diffrent but its good to make a change I've heard every song and they are the far the best evanescence songs. People need to know that evanescence will change their style in music. this album is excellent, BUY THIS
030726999X|5.0|The final book in the \\"Girl\\" trilogy was just as exciting and action-filled as the two previous ones.  I particularly liked that it began right where the previous book left off, not making the reader wonder what had happened \\"in between\\" books.  \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" continued to fill in the facts of the amazing, ongoing story, and left me a satisfied reader.  An excellent read, I'm just sorry this was the last one!  The books should DEFINITELY be read in order.
B0058A119G|5.0|Vintage Barbra.....great music!  The bonus CD contains favorite songs from over the years.  Love this selection of Barbra's music.  Great to relax with.
B004ZN9NCY|4.0|Probably not for the casual fan of the Floyd. It's a bit rough around the edges, but like most of their work before Meddle, they were still experimenting and searching for their sound.<br /><br />However, there is some good protean proto-Floyd on here. The live version of the 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun' is solid. I find that the Waters and Gilmour solo efforts are very good too. I often listen to Waters' 'Grantchester Meadows' and Gilmour's 3-part 'The Narrow Way'. 'Several Species....' is, of course, an interesting and unique track.<br /><br />The Wright and Mason stuff, not that great. Their solo efforts are more percussive and experimental and thus a bit more difficult to digest. The flute intro and outro on Mason's set are decent - wish these sections were longer.<br /><br />4 stars for the Waters/Gilmour sections and the live version of 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun'.
B00011KHTM|1.0|I was sent the wrong item.  I specifically said that I needed a Powerpoint adapter for a MacBook Air and was sent one for a MacBook.  Haven't returned it yet and still need the MacBook Air adapter.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Everyone already knows the movies.  The biggest change with these for me was the sound.  I have played the DVDs on my current sound system and it is nothing like the Bluray.  They did a great job with the sound on this edition and it really makes the experience a lot better.  I wish the films would be in the original cut and not the special special special edition, but this is all we get.
B004HW7JMO|3.0|I never watched the first season of Spartacus so I wasn't sure what to expect from this. I knew it would violent and saying that is an understatement. I've never seen so much blood, decapitations, bludgeoning, etc. in one program. These scenes are inter-cut with sex scenes that run the gamut from lesbian soft-porn to orgies. Nudity, both sexes, is plentiful. The production values are good. The series has the look of \\"300\\" with surreal color tones and dramatic sets. The story did not interest me enough to seek out more episodes.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|This app ruined my relationship. Me and dis girl were going steady then she be looking through my phone and she say &quot;kids paint, you got kids!!!&quot;, she ain't done want a man with kids, so she drop me like I drop fresh lycs in da studio. Den I was like &quot;shake to clear&quot; wtf, I puts me phone in my blendtech and day cleared it aight, now Amazon owe me a new phone. /end sarcasm.
B003X645YA|4.0|I originally purchased this album because it was on the $5 page and I listened to the samples and liked what I heard.  Then I saw the documentary on the making of Smile, and listened again.  I found that my whole opinion had changed.  Brian Wilson called Rhapsody in Blue the reason that he got into music and you can hear the love and respect that he put into this album with every track.  There certainly have been better versions of Gershwin songs, and Brian does not go into depth here to reveal or revamp unknown pieces, but you can hear that each piece is sung joyfully and soulfully.
B005BZQTGS|4.0|I thought it was fun.  If you are offended by bad language do not watch this.  The F word is used quite a bit, and there's a lot of sexual innuendo.  A short scene with topless females as well.  The comedy was silly and fun.  I bet this movie was fun to make.  The cast made it fun to watch.
B004L07KWQ|3.0|Cannot choose the color used to paint.  Shake to clear screen.  As the app name says, &quot;Kids&quot; Paint.  Otherwise good.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My kids loved Perplexus and were so excited for the new one to come out. Now, they love the Epic version. My husband and I can become addicted to it as well. Great toy!
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Take a walk, listen to a CD, watch someone else's home video; do anything besides watching this movie.  It is a boring, pretentious, plotless stinker.  Pitt and Penn, you owe me the $3.49 I spent to rent this piece of cheese.  What were you thinking?
1594744769|3.0|This book is definitely best for a teen audience but was an entertaining book club read for Halloween. I say best for teens because the  narrator is of that age and his thought processes/language are really simple. Not a lot of layers to this book, it skims the surface but it's a good read for its purpose.
B000024973|5.0|This album is awesome you need to get this if your a smiths fan I wish there was a dvd to go with this.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|oh awwehhhhh great can't wait to share I love this app.  easy to use no weird app things just draw with your finger.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Awesome show, each episode is exciting from beginning to end.  Just enough of a continuing plot but each one has its own story as well.
0446547654|5.0|This storyline has been written over and over again. This is very common and everyone who experiences it wants to write their story.  Basically, high school sweethearts break up having chosen different path in their lives. They reunite in their hometown to attend a funeral....hence, the spark of love is set aflame again. Old story, but one that never fails to entertain because we all really believe in that beautiful, special eternal love and living happily ever after fairy tale. This one comes with a twist. I found the story charming and lovely and written beautifully as only Nick Sparks can do!
B005N0PJJO|5.0|I don't know how I even came across this series, but what a lucky girl I am.  It's a keeper for sure & I hope E. L. James doesn't make us wait too long on the next entry to this delicious series.  I must admit, most books with relationship woes I don't normally put myself in their shoes, even if I get wrapped up in the character(s), but I actually had feelings for these folks.  I'm ready to feel Fifty Shades Deeper!
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Although it claims to be complete, it is not. Still needs options for notes, journaling, categories, and tasks.  However, that being said, it is MUCH better than most! I'd easily pay a couple dollars more for those added improvements, which I would expect to be standard on a 'business' calendar.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I actually gave my review after reading book 2, but decided book 1 needed one as well.  Read both of these books in 4 days-now I'm feeling withdrawls.  I love the characters and the plot.  It was a step out of my norm and I relished it.  Loved it and can't wait until the next one.  Worth the extra batteries in the FLASHLIGHT  i know what some of you might be thinking, but truly it was).  Hubby doesn't like the bedside lamp on at 3a.m. ha ha    These books definitely entertain your brain....so step outside your box & read on!  Thank you E. L. James!  Feels like Christmas in October.
0312576463|2.0|I enjoyed the beginning of this book, but I ended up hating every single character by the end. I think this was the authors intent--helping us see how inherently selfish we can be as human beings inhabiting the same planet. I guess I was hoping for a fairy tale ending, but that's not real life, is it?  I also felt like the \\"sex scenes\\" in the book were way over the top, every single one, almost as if every person's need for sex is the drive from which they make their every decision.  It kind of turned my stomach, which again, I think was part of the point of the book.
030726999X|4.0|Book was in great condition and arrived on time. My husband and I have completely enjoyed all three books in this series.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I chose this for my bookclub to read the month it was published- a gamble because it was so new that only the Amazon vine reviews were out.  \\"Seems like a boy book\\" were some of the comments initially, but it got an unprecedented thumbs up from all eight ladies. It's fun, fresh, thought provoking, and totally relatable. You will love it, no matter who you are- Are you a child of the eighties? This will be a special treat for you. Are you now or have you ever been a nerd? Dated a nerd (don't say no, you know you have)? Your inner geek will thank you. Are you on Facebook? Then you'll relate to the challenges of understanding real vs. virtual relationships. Treasure hunter? You know it's here. Gamer of any ilk or era? Prepare to read your favorite book ever.  From the first 20 pages on, I was already recommending this to every person I encountered who knows how to read.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|I don't have children and simply got this app for the entertainment. The touch paint progams typically irk me because they lag or are real shaky, but this one is pretty solid. I like keeping it on the various brushes setting and writing little honey-dos for my husband then sending them to his phone.  Works great on Samsung Galaxy S.
0802473156|5.0|I am celebrating my 25th wedding anniversary in a couple of weeks, and through this book I learned how to better communicate my love for my wife in her \\"love language\\". We have a great marriage, but I am excited that I am still learning how to make our marriage better. This book is a must read for marriages in any stage of life.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|It works great with my iPhone 4. I can tilt my iPhone to any orientation 3D. I can also attach the mount to another professional tripod that I have.
B00004NHCC|2.0|This particular CD is not the best recording of this seminal album that Amazon has available.  If you're willing to spring for a few extra bucks then please check out the 2005 mastering by Lonehill: [[ASIN:B000786JPK Complete Recordings With Clifford Brown]].<br /><br />To my ear the later re-issue is clearly superior.  See for yourself by listening back and forth to Amazon's samples for \\"Jim\\" on each of the recordings.  Pay particular attention to Jimmy Jones on the ivories in the background.  The piano on the 2000 CD sounds \\"tinny\\" in comparison.
B002NT3B52|5.0|I just finished reading this wonderfully written book and will re-read it. I became aware of this book after reading Dog Sense by John Bradshaw. I enjoyed Mr. Bradshaw's book, but I found Inside the Dog to be more informative from a dog's perspective. These are both fantastic books to read for people who want to learn about how dogs relate to us and their circumstances and for those who desire a caring and not domineering relationship with their canine \\"best friend(s).\\" If you are looking for a how-to book, without wanting to learn about the biology and psychology of dogs, then this probably will not be the book for you, but I would encourage you to read it for the sake of your dog =)
B00166996S|5.0|So, I've been a Muse fan for a few years. I came across this CD in the mall today and said sure why not and bought it. I didn't realize it was a live CD till after I bought it.  I was amazed at how good they sound live. It has reinforced my appreciation for this band. A must have for any true MUSE fan.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The puzzles are challenging if you try to solve them with the least number of moves.  The interface is pleasing and the music is very relaxing - which reduces anxiety as you attempt to solve each board and collect the pearls.  I am half way through and find the app well worth my time and 99&cent;.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|\\"Off-label\\" use - tracking tremor disorders?<br /><br />I downloaded this app because it was free and looked cute, but when I traced across the touch screen with my finger it dawned on me* that this might be a perfect alternative to pencil and paper for more than making pictures...<br /><br />OK, background: Patients seeking treatment for any condition with an associated tremor are often instructed to draw little spirals that can reveal characteristic patterns for diagnosis and track changes to determine the effectiveness of certain medications.  The spirals are drawn daily, with the dominant hand using a pencil that just barely touches a piece of paper.<br /><br />*[cue lightbulb] Waitaminit... The touch screen on my phone is a far more accurate than pencil and paper... using the phone I carry all the time would make the task easier to remember and do regularly...  and the digital are more convenient than paper to organize and keep!  Perfect!<br /><br />Although I speak from experience, I should clarify that currently I am NOT under any doctor's order to practice this exercise.  I know the information is valuable and the log is important; I also know that maintaining it is irksome at best.  If it were this simple, though?  I just might draw little spirals every day anyway!<br /><br />IMPORTANT: I AM NOT A DOCTOR OR A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, NOR AM I QUALIFIED IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER TO GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE. THIS REVIEW GIVES MY PERSONAL OPINION ONLY. I'VE NEVER EVEN DISCUSSED THIS IDEA WITH A DOCTOR. If your doctor told you to draw circles on paper you should by all means continue to do so as instructed!
B004L07KWQ|4.0|This app isn't all bells and whistles but it's really fun!  My kids really enjoy drawing with it.  This app is especially good for killing time in waiting rooms and keeps the kids still and quiet!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|As an app, it's one of the best ones out there. Very well developed and constantly making it better.  As a Bible app, I honestly can think of little that could be done to improve it!  I've been using one of the Bible plans for a year now, and have just about finished.  Great way to keep you in God's word! I love listening to the audio in the morning while I make breakfast. Enjoy!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down! Excellent and interesting story line with great plot twists. Just the right amount of detail- I could see it in my mind and yet wasn't bogged down by too much description.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Best game I have played on the Android platform. Beautiful graphics and intriguing puzzles, a huge step up from the average, highly repetitious games that are more typical of what is available.
0062011847|5.0|Snuff is another delightfully funny volume in the Discworld fantasy series.  But the Pratchett fan should be aware of a problem with the Kindle edition.  The Kindle editor placed all the footnotes at the end of the book rather than at the end of a chapter or bottom of the page where you could reference the source.  Fans who love Pratchett's footnoting as much as I do should stick with the paper editions.  Other than that this book does not disappoint.  It is wonderfully Discworld.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Look if you need a review to convince you to buy SOA your an idiot. Buy it already. Have a good weekend.
1612130283|5.0|Never had a book take hold of me like this one.  I am totally in love with Christian Grey, I can not wait till my order comes in for the Fifty Shades Darker.  I can't believe it could get better.  This book was Fabulous.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|It's probably okay for babies, but my two-year old was looking for more options and got frustrated trying to figure out how to pick the colors he wanted to use.  If you have a kid who is 2 1/2 or older, Kids Finger Paint by Cogito Games is probably a better option for them.  It is similar to this app but has a few more options.
0553801473|4.0|This felt almost like an incredibly good 'fanfic' book.<br />One that got written 'between' real books by the author.<br /><br />I enjoyed the stories about the characters, but they *almost*<br />seemed like 'background' stories.  Filling in LOTS of minor<br />details about what happens between major plot points.<br /><br />With few exceptions, barring some bizarre twist of plot in the next book, the reader doesn't REALLY need to know most of the stuff that happens in this book.  I suspect you could skip this book, and when you read the next one, you wouldn't realize you had missed one.<br /><br />That said, I still enjoyed the read.  It was fun to get to know the characters a little better.  See them in the mundane day to day activities that is their lives.  In a way, it gives a little better 'perspective' to view the earth shaking events.  The idea that earth shaking stuff is the EXCEPTION, not the rule.<br /><br />I'm a fisherman, and I see it a little like fishing: If I nearly always caught 4 or 5 limits of my target fish every time I went out, I would call it a bad day when I went out and only caught 2 limits.  But if I usually only catch one limit, then catching 2 limits is a good day!<br /><br />I guess I'm saying maybe GRRM attempted to lower our expectations a little, so he can WOW us with just a COUPLE major events in the next book.  OR maybe not.  But like I said, I did enjoy the read, even though nothing really momentous happened.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Great to be able to log in and get your music from anywhere. download and store on the device is a great feature too. would be 5 stars if the library navigation was easier. difficult to find specific songs, genres, albums, etc. using only search. Browse functionality needs significant improvement.
0439023491|5.0|Wow !  While I was reading this book (2nd in a trilogy and YES, I read them all back-to-back,) when I did not have the book open in my hands I was thinking about it and how the story might ultimately come together.  Terrific exciting addictive read.  Still think about it regularly.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I missed most of this season while deployed but have to say the show has lost nothing over time.  The stories are fresh and the comedy is an instant classic.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|Well written show with great plots and character development.  Always well acted and entertaining.  Fun bonus features that give interesting insights to the actors, writers and production.
B001SS3JS8|4.0|I've read a few of Jodi Picoult's books and found them riveting, well-written, and well researched. The Pact, though, started out slow and dragging. I didn't like the back-and-forth of time. I stuck with it, since as I said, I like this author. I'm glad I read on past page 50. It did get better--much better--and it held me throughout the rest of the book. I truly felt a connection with her characters, and it also gave insight into courtroom proceedings and jail.
142311339X|5.0|My8 yr old who loves to read and loves all things mythological is really enjoying this book.  I have not read it myself but he is very absorbed in it!
B004L07KWQ|5.0|At first, I thought that this app didn't have enough options, but then I realized that the simplicity was probably intentional as this is labeled for children.<br /><br />SHAKE TO CLEAR, although I didn't know that until I read the description in the app store.<br /><br />FUN TIP: if you use two fingers on the screen (like the pinching motion used for enlarging or shrinking the screen) keeping the fingers equidistant, move them as if tracing the outline of a circle.  You will get several lines overlapping each, creating a multicolored start burst effect.<br /><br />I also imported a picture of some plans for a cottage, and was able to draw some furniture in the plans, which was cool, although I couldn't shrink the picture on the screen to get the full layout (which was how I discovered the multicolored sunburst.)
B004L07KWQ|1.0|Installed fine, but when I try to open it responds with a dialogue box that says &quot;Attention: Clear Screen?&quot; Ok or Clear. Does not matter what you hit...the box won't go away. This app looks cool, and I would love to have it.
B005GVA2L0|3.0|OK, let me start by saying that the deluxe version has probably the worst digipak packaging ever. It's like the want to punish you for buying the more expensive version, by giving it in a box that can damage your cd and dvd! So annoying!  As for the album it's good, but sometimes listening to it it seams like it's something from the year 2000. It' like Amy is trying hard to get back the grat feeling of Orgin and Fallen, and add something new and fresh, but to me it still sounds dated. Anyway it's a really solid effort, with a few stand out songs. Pretty muxh a must have for evanescence fans! Rating: 3/5.  Standout Tracks:  The Change  The Other Side  Oceans
0811879542|5.0|What a super creative yet amazingly simple book this is.  I wish I had written it myself!  The concept is simple:  kids read and \\"interact\\" with a series of dots.  The book asks them to press, blow, shake and clap which makes the dots change and move.  By \\"magic\\" the dots react to the kids movements and actions.  I have a 3 year old son who just loves this book - he's charmed by all the action and loves being part of the story.  Each time we take out this book we go through it at least twice (usually many more!  I highly recommend this book for all kids, and as parents you will have fun reading it too!
B0055IU4GM|3.0|To say that John Hiatt is probably my favorite male songwriter is saying a lot...it puts him ahead of the likes of Jackson Browne, Rodney Crowell, Tom Petty, Steve Earle and John Mellencamp. I don't know what it is...maybe it's the way he so brilliantly blends pathos and humor, topping it all off with a dash of quirky insight.<br /> It;s this quirkiness that has always set Hiatt apart from the rest....he has an innate eye for the real, the rediculous and the ever so small details. But then he can just flip it all on it's head with a slightly skewered turn, usually wrapping things up with a wink, a nudge and a  smirk...or a tug on the heartstrings. In the end, the listener is often left going \\"Wow!\\" or \\"Huh!\\"<br /> But something seems to have happened to Hiatt as he's settled into a contented middle age...he seems to have gotten a bit...complacent. This decade got off to a sort of \\"hit and miss\\" start ~ personally, I liked 2000's CROSSING MUDDY WATERS and loved BENEATH THIS GRUFF EXTERIOR in 2003, while 2001's THE TIKI BAR IS OPEN and 2005's MASTER OF DISASTER were just...O.K.<br /> However, I think I really started to see a pattern developing with his last three albums. I really dug 2008's SAME OLD MAN ~ along with BENEATH..., it's probably my favorite Hiatt album of the last fifteen years ~ but I don't love it enough to keep hearing the songs over and over again.<br /> And I don't mean playing the same disc repeatedly.....much of what plagued last year's THE OPEN ROAD and now the new DIRTY JEANS & MUDSLIDE HYMNS is a SEVERE sense of deja vu...we've heard all of these songs before ~ tales of cars, ghosts (real and imagined), new and old love, etc. Make no mistake, these are all still Hiatt songs, but there's just no....spark.<br /> The disc opens with the foreboding \\"Damn This Town.\\" There's a sinister quality to both the arrangement and Hiatt's lead vocal that works to both their advantages. By the time he snarls the lyrics \\"Now I can't let my mama/Tell you what her youngest boy did\\" , well, it's chilling. Very nice.<br /> Up next is \\"Til I Get My Lovin' Back.\\" This song should break your heart, but I can't help but feel that Hiatt's done this all before, and to much better effect. In the past, it would rip your soul out to hear the words \\"My friends are so wrong/When they say just go on/And I say \\"Where to and what for?'\\". Now? They're just words.<br /> Ditto \\"I Love That Girl.\\" I, for one, am happy that Hiatt has found long-lasting wedded bliss, but, more and more, it's making for less and less interesting songwriting. The vocal here is nice enough, with a spritely arrangement, but in the end this one's over and done with before it's even finished.<br /> Saying \\"All The Way Under\\" is the album's best track really isn't saying much, but it's true...the cut sports the most original arrangement, the smoothest, most unaffected lead vocal and the best lyric, hands down: \\"I don't trust a man that ain't been lost/I don't trust a woman ain't been double crossed.\\" About as close to perfect as we're going to get here.<br /> \\"Don't Want To Leave You Now\\" is another track that just reeks of \\"Been there, done that\\"-itis. An arrangement that should be sentimental and sweet comes across as plodding, while the lead vocal is somewhat mannered. I never thought I'd be saying this, but Hiatt's spinning his wheels here. And that kills me.<br /> Things only get worse. Is John Hiatt SO tapped out that he has to give us yet ANOTHER car song??? First it was \\"Cherry Red\\" on SAME OLD MAN, then \\"Fireball Roberts\\" from THE OPEN ROAD. Now we have \\"Detroit Made.\\" Talk about filler....this is 3:57 that just takes up space. C'mon, John!<br /> There's an aching weariness to \\"Hold On For Your Love\\" that just spills out of the speakers. The arrangement, equal parts pained and chilly, is haunting, while Hiatt's vocal captures and conveys resolve, longing, frustration, pain and determination. Toss in another killer line (\\"Out in the woods/My old truck is on fire/Burning the last drops of my enormous desire\\") and you have another one of DJ&MH's few bright spots.<br /> On a stronger disc, \\"Train To Birmingham\\" would have been what they used to call a \\"strong album cut\\", a solid \\"side two, track three.\\" Here? It's just another cut....O.K., nothing special, nothing awful. Just...O.K.<br /> \\"Down Around My Place\\" is a VERY mixed bag...I love the Southern Gothic vibe early on, and the lines \\"While the young ones crowd the table/Down around my place/Bitchin' about no cable\\" are classic, but the arena-rock arrangement during the middle of the song just comes across as bloated, dated and over the top.

0439023521|5.0|An utterly gripping story: Brave New World meets Romeo and Juliet meets  Last of the Mohicans.  Easily the most compelling novel I've read in years, probably one of the best adventure novels I've read in my whole life.  Marketed as a youth book, but probably too grim for anyone under 14.  Action sequences are very well done, not just because of excellent pacing and vivid imagery but because the author's style allows the reader to really experience what the protagonist feels.  Characters are complex and believable, and extremely moving in their simple humanity and struggle to determine right from wrong, truth from falsehood.  On top of everything else, this novel is a dark, sardonic critique of society's structures, the exploitation of the poor by the rich, the commodification of violence and the trivialization of human life.  And yet, the overall tone is still hopeful, that even in the darkest circumstances, duty and love and sacrifice still have meaning.  Profoundly moving -- I found myself thinking about this book, again and again, long after finishing it.  Highest possible recommendation.

0765350386|4.0|Immersive - like all good reads should be. As has been noted, the Allomancy is convincing.  This is the first I have read of this author and I have read none of Hobb or Jordan.  It caught my eye at a book shop and the story enticed me and I loved the large print the normal edition had - so rare to find but so important.  This held my attention to the end. I normally enjoy re-reading Gene Wolfe's Book of The New Sun and find it difficult to pick up a new author.  Some have complained at the lack of skill with dialogue, however the book has obviously been well honed to produce a plot which never slackens and keeps its readers going until the end. I didn't mind when a character \\"paused\\" or their eyes rolled. I find it funny that these things were mentioned, as it did not detract from my enjoyment. As for some mentioning the plot repeating, yes, I see their point, yet I also see the  book as a well constructed whole that flows seamlessly. I wouldn't bring down the book because of its dialogue, it does the job for me, not a book I'm likely to re-read, so I guess there is some truth to those reviews, yet I find myself caring for the characters - more than just cut outs for me, perhaps others are comparing too much.  There are some spiritual lessons within - Sazed taking care even with menial duties (which leads to taking care with all we encounter), the law of change/impermanence (Vin highlights her struggle with this).  The action reminds me of Dragon Ball Z and is very stirring.  It is nice to have a strong female lead who has a huge development arc.  I enjoyed her Mistborn battle.  The Allomancy is spectacular, and this would make a great movie.

B0053TMP24|5.0|For those who haven't read the prior books, The Heroes of Olympus is an offshoot of The Olympians series which follow Percy Jackson, the half mortal son of Poseidon, and the kids in Camp Half-Blood as they fight monsters and a major threat to their Greek god parents. The Lost Hero, first book in the Heroes of Olympus series, introduces us to other kids from Camp Half-Blood who play important roles in the next big challenge. We also meet Jason Grace from Camp Jupiter, who initially can't recall anything before waking up on a school bus with kids from Camp Half-Blood, even though they all &#34;remember&#34; him as being one of them. Percy Jackson is missing, so a search goes on for him while dealing with a quest to rescue Hera.<br /><br />In this latest book Percy Jackson has amnesia. He'd been asleep somewhere for 8 months and only knows his name and how to fight, although certain things seem familiar. He's being chased by gorgons who keep coming back after he kills them. He seems to feel where he needs to go and is guided into Camp Jupiter, the camp for children and descendants of the Roman gods, by the goddess Juno herself. Percy joins Frank and Hazel on a quest to free Thanatos, the god of Death from a giant. His capture allows monsters back into the realm of the living. And his memory comes back during the quest which takes them from San Francisco, all the way up into Alaska. We get to learn about the different aspects of the gods. For instance, while Ares and Mars are the same god, each has a different personality, somewhat based on how the different cultures looked at them. The god of war as Mars is somewhat more compassionate than his Greek Ares' persona.<br /><br />Juno/Hera purposely blanked out Percy and Jason's memories and put them in opposing camps so that the Greeks and Romans could learn to get along; they'll need to in order for the fighting that is yet to come.<br /><br />What I really like about these books is the use of mythology from the gods to the various types of monsters. We first became familiar with the Greek Pantheon and with this book, the Romans. And the kids all have different aspects of what their parents can do and must learn to become proficient and confident with their abilities. The books teach that bravery means doing what you must, even while having doubts and shaking in your boots. Monsters are fought with a combination of fighting and outsmarting.<br /><br />There's a great deal of humor in the books and in this case we learn the &#34;real&#34; goal of Amazon. There's also plenty of action and self-discovery. This rather large book moves along at a good clip and is an enjoyable read.he various types of monsters.

1423140591|5.0|Everytime I read one of the Percy Jackson series books, I think to myself that I should have read it slower so that the joy I get from reading his work would last longer. Riordans rich storytelling is fascinating as its based on real myths from our past.
B004EPZ084|4.0|I had also heard great things about this movie. Well..It has it's moments that you'll laugh and it has it's moments that seemed to get too serious for a comedy movie. Also, the plot sort of jumped around a bit. The kind of humor you can expect:<br />- \\"They shouldn't put a childrens park next to a bar. It's entrapment\\" (One member is a sex offendor for peeing in a park at night)<br />- Colin Ferrell says to fire a guy who he calls Prof. Xavier for \\"Creeps me out, rolling around all day in his special little secret chair.\\" (It's a wheelchair)<br />- Detective stops the guys - \\"Why were you speeding?\\", \\"I was drag racing.\\", \\"In a prius?\\", \\"I don't win alot\\"<br />So, you can see it DOES have it's funny moments.<br />It just gets too serious sometimes and it takes a bit of the laughter away from the humor. It's worth the watch and if you are a fan of the stars of the movie, pic it up but renting it isn't a bad idea for some people.
B0000042HV|5.0|I have complete sets performed by Rasumowsky, Emerson, Borodin (both recordings), Shostakovich and Brodsky String Quartets. I find very different treatments from each, all interesting and worthwhile, and the Fitzwilliam especially warm, authoritative and impassioned. I sought out reviews of this performance before I selected it, and I was not disappointed. These Shostakovich quartets are endlessly listenable in my opinion, and easily are included in my short list of best twentieth century music. I would recommend that anyone with more than one set include this version.

B004WR125O|5.0|I have an Onkyo TX-NR609 AV receiver which I installed a few weeks ago and I love it.  I also purchased the UWF-1 wireless LAN adapter.  When I first plugged UWF-1 into the USB slot and hit the USB button on the remote nothing happened and I don't know why. A week or so later I tried it again.  The UWF-1 showed 3 wireless connections in my area, mine and my neighbors.  I manually connected to my Belken Pre-N router and zap I was connected.  I then hit the NET button on the remote and up came the various internet radio stations.  These stations will also come up without having the UWF-1 wireless LAN adapter connected, but the stations will not connect.  So now I listen to my favorite music on Pandora and other channels and the music plays through my surround sound.  I see that some who bought the UWF-1 couldn't get it to work.  Maybe their Onkyo receivers are not set-up for it.
0062060554|5.0|This book just blew my mind! I was expecting a predictable read about a woman who has amnesia. This book is so much more!<br /><br />Christina wakes up every morning not remembering much at all. She doesn't remember her husband who is in bed next to her. She doesn't know where she is. Every day she relearns her life. Christina has had an accident of some sort where she has sustained a brain injury which has left her in this state. Instantly the reader knows something is off and the twists and turns of the plot begin. I had my suspects in mind. I was wrong. Very wrong!<br /><br />This is a wonderful debut book by S.J. Watson. She weaves a suspenseful plot that will keep you from wanting to put this book down. There were times I could honestly feel Christina's confusion. I didn't know who she should trust. And just when I thought I knew who Christina should stay away from, the story took an unexpected turn.<br /><br />This is a great psychological thriller and I highly recommend it. It was written in such a way that I truly felt I was in Christina's mind. I look forward to seeing more from S.J. Watson in the future!
1439152799|3.0|I found the book very difficult to get into but worth the effort. Very flowery prose but the plot was interesting. Definitely not a book you can read a few pages and put down and pick up days later.
0062011847|4.0|I agree with the critics who state that the characters of Lady Sybil (too confident and sexy) and Wilikens (less butler, more martial arts man of all work) are off, although she naturally may have become more confident in the course of maturation, and he always was a general nutter.  It does seem that the brilliancy has gone from the diamond, but I think it is still valuable, non the less, simply because there are no other jewels as fine or rare.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Real Steel is a rare gem in modern movie production. It tells the story of a man looking for redemption, and a boy looking for the attention of a father he never had.   While watching this, I could see and almost feel the emotions of the various characters on the screen, and I was moved by them. In most movies produced today, that is a rare quality. I've always loved films about an underdog earning a comeback but this was absolutely amazing. I was even more surprised to learn that the robots were animatronic, not all CGI- another rare quality in movies produced today. Another added bonus was all the scenes filmed in Detroit (i'm from the Kalamazoo area so Michigan pride was very high).   During the whole movie I got really into it, cheering on the robots, wanting to kick Hugh Jackman's character, and my boyfriend laughed when I accidentally threw a punch in my seat (woops!).   If you're looking for a heartfelt, emotionally charged movie that brings action and feeling together, I highly recommend Real Steel.
B004EPZ08O|3.0|I think it's more then fair to say that most peoples favorites of this series are either 1 or 2, and then 3 and 4 where a little disappointing, but much to my surprise, this 5th installment was a lot of fun and had some awesome death scenes. This one's premises are the same as every other FD movie, this time the group of survivors cheat death after getting off of a bus that falls victim to strong winds that bring down a large motorway bridge (similar to the Golden Gate Bridge).  Of coarse as expected, Death comes for them one by one and they figure this out, and try to avoid it. The last 2 movies had something that just didn't make them as great as the first 2, almost like they where made for \\"direct to DVD\\" release, but this one here, you may expect \\"they are just cashing in on the franchise now\\" but this one had some thought put into it and the effects looked pretty good, so it was well worth a cinematic release.   Make sure you stick around for the closing credits as AC/DC's \\"If You Want Blood\\" roars through the speakers and you get an awesome montage of pretty much every death from the FD series... in 3D!  I'm not sure how that is going to look when it comes to home viewing, but in the cinemas it looked absolutely awesome!

1423113454|3.0|The Red Pyramid was a decent book, but I didn't like it nearly as much as I did Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Carter and Sadie, while pretty good characters, weren't nearly as entertaining or likable as Percy and his friends. The frequent interruptions of the narrative for them to argue or mock each other were amusing at first, but quickly grew tiresome. I also didn't quite get a British feel from Sadie's sections,  especially towards the end, which made it more difficult to tell who was speaking.  I did like the new arena of Egyptian mythology, which isn't quite as well known as Greek. Parts of it, particularly the possession by gods, reminded me a bit of Stargate: SG-1, but that's probably because at least half of my knowledge of Egyptian mythology comes from that show. I also thought the magic used by the House of Light was very interesting, and the House itself has high potential for future plots. I'm hoping that The Throne of Fire will improve on these issues, because I really did like the books about the Olympians.

B003L77GRO|3.0|Season 5 is good classic Dexter and is surely worth watching, but it seems to have lost a little of its edge and didn't take as many risks as earlier seasons. Overall still very enjoyable. One peeve - the Showtime commercials cannot be skipped or even scurried through with fast-forward. VERY annoying, Showtime. I pay good money for DVD's so that I don't have to watch commercials if I don't want to!
0689878451|5.0|I originally purchased this book in a bookstore in San Francisco.  As a primary Life Skills teacher, I thought this heartwarming picture book could be used for discusion of differences in families.

I purchased this book for them to celebrate this joyous occasion!!!
0385344325|5.0|The Affair is the book Reacher Creatures have been waiting on to flesh out Jack's exit from the military. As a creature myself, I can report that Child's latest outing does not disappoint. In fact, I place it solidly in the top 1/3 of Reacher's adventures despite what seems a decidedly reduced expression of his typical violence. Said absentee violence is replaced by an accelerated incidence of sexual encounters. If the book has a flaw, this is probably it. As Reacher is a love em and leave em kind of guy, to love em and love em and love em (multiply by at least 2) then leave em isn't usually his style. Trysts aside, The Affair is a solid thriller in the classic vein we've come to expect from Child. Tense moments are followed by contemplative reflection shadowed by investigative work like only Reacher does it. Then the cycle repeats, and the reader is richer for it. Munro and Neagley provide competent support and offer rare insight into personnel who can hold their own alongside our hero. Devereaux is just the kind of woman Reacher would go for, and, as always, we trust his instincts over those of the establishment. Jack's actions are what we'd have expected from him, and Child leaves your literary belly full and satisfied. If you're not into Reacher, you're sorely missing out. If you are, you know what to expect and will be pleased.
