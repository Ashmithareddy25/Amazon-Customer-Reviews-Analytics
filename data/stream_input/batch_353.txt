B000002U8G|4.0|Most fall into Pink Floyd starting out with Darkside of the Moon. The natural progression based on album popularity probably continues on with The Wall, Wish You Were Here, Pulse, Animals, The Division Bell, and so on with many different permutations. Meddle is my favorite of the &quot;less popular&quot; Floyd albums although as any Amazon regular will know, a product with 225 reviews is not neccesarily a &quot;hidden gem&quot;.<BR>Meddle is the album that came before Darkside of the Moon and is a little less refined and which works in it favor. The album is essentialy a three song album as tracks 2 and 4 will quickly be regulars on the short end of the skip button. <br />One of These Days opens the album up with a driving bass line that is soon joined by some exquisite slide guitar and finishes srong with a rocking riff that will be sure to have you air guitarring your arm off. Song number three is called Fearless. Its an acoustic masterpiece with lyrical signifigance to boot. The riff is so clear is sounds like its being played in your head and the song has a soothing sense to it everytime you hear it. The fifth songs is the epic masterpiece that is Echoes. It about 25 minutes long and besides an annoying three minutes in the middle (whale sounds are so creepy) its spectacular. Very complex and needs to be heard to be believed. The song is the perfect example of tension release and build up it is the sacred dogma of stoners around the world.<br />Bottom line: A spectacular 35 minutes of music that new Floyd fans may not have experienced.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|Great movie - but what was even greater was I placed my order and L. Dowling had it shipped that very same day!  Amazing customer service.
B00006IU73|5.0|If music is the food of Gods, then Mr. Steven Wilson is a master chef cuz his briallint musicianship is almost unparalled. For a rabid fan of Pink Floyd like me who also happens to be a morbid metal fan, this album is a gift from heaven. As Floyd aged and we dont hear such music anymore, In Absentia fills the void. I am neither musically qualified nor trained to judge/review such an album as this one but I love it so much that I wanted to speak the word (as Queensryche, the majesty says). <br />This is one of the greatest albums to come out in a very long time. Such masters as Darkside of the moon, Master of Puppets, Awake (Dream Theater), Script for a jesters tear (Marillion) and then In Absentia. I heard about this band from another brilliant band Opeth, whose latest work was produced by the chief song writer of Porcupine Tree, Steve Wilson. This album is like a mix of best of Floyd, little bit of Opeth, some DT, little REM and then some. From the heavy and outstanding BLackest Eyes the album begins and gets into Trains which features a superb lead on some accoustic string instrument mildy reminescent of the final music from Last of the Mohicans. Lips of Ashes and the rest of songs, I have no words to describe them. From prog rock to metal to psychedecil or what ever its called, every song in here is a gem. This album is a modern day classic. I guess perhaps we will never recognize the true genius of this album until some more years.  <br />Life is incomplete without music, its meaningless without music, nothing in the world is worth more than music and music is what In Absentia is. You HAVE you listen to this music to understand/feel what it is. No reviewer in the world can write well enough about this CD. Long live Porcupine Tree, God bless Steve Wilson and the crew, my day/life is incomplete without In Absentia...
B00009ATIX|3.0|I had great expectations for this movie and it was nothing like I thought it would be. George Clooney is almost exactly the same character from ER, a broody, arrogant doctor, psychiatrist Chris Kelvin. He meets a woman on a train and they marry after a hot tryst. Later, he is recruited to go to a space station where strange things have been happening to the staff. Upon arriving, he finds only two staff members remain (a physicist and a computer tech) and they are being 'visited' by beings, not aliens and not quite ghosts. Kelvin is visited by an imitation of his wife Rheya (who halfway through the movie we find out had commited suicide) and he wants desperately for things to turn out different than they did on Earth years ago. The scientist on board warns it will not work out and they come up with a plan to destory the visitor. After detroying imitation Rheya, the doctor escapes as the station heads for certain doom. Kelvin has a change of heart and stays behind on Solaris, which may or may not be his utopia.<br /><br />The timeline is hard to follow and there are a couple of characters who are really unessential to the plot. It's pretty good if your a fan of sci-fi-type movies, it is not so much romantic as it looked to me.
0783235607|5.0|Classic horror and suspense stiched together just as solid as Norman's birds. This film still holds unforgetable terror even today.  I was 11 years old when I first saw this masterpiece by the great director, Alfred Hitchcock.  With a great cast and script, this film set the standard for all other horror films to follow.  My aunt warned me not to watch it alone, but I did anyway. There are many  fantastic camera angles and surprises in the movie, but the scene that actually frightened me the most was at the sherriff's home when Marion's sister tells him she saw an old woman up in the window. The sherriff says &quot; You say you saw an old woman sitting upstairs by the window...If that woman is mrs. Bates, then who is that woman buried out in the cemetery?&quot;  That scene and the staircase scene with the detective falling backwards will always stay etched in my mind.  As far as the cellar scene near the end, I read where Hitchcock , as a boy growing up in England, was actually detained in his own cellar as punishment by his parents for three full days.  All  great directors have some sort of dark side.  This classic will forever remain as my all time favorite.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I really loved the first one.  This one is so so.  The bright spots for me: one thousand Agent Smiths.  How can you go wrong?

B00009RDGA|5.0|Great. This movie is an essential and Tatum O'Neal is hilarious in her Academy Award-winning role as the cigarette-smoking nine-year-old, Addie Loggins, who joins conman Moses Pray (real-life-father Ryan O'Neal) after the death of her mother. This movie is in beautiful black & white and is directed by Peter Bogdanovich whose direction is marvelous! Co-starring is Madeline Kahn as the 'Harem-Girl-Dancer' Trixie Delight who comes between 'Moze' and Addie.  <BR> This movie is rated PG for severe language, sexual content, and brief violence. In my opinion, this movie should be rated PG-13.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie, but it seems to be worse than it is because of one reason...... It was the sequel to a GREAT movie. A movie that broke new ground and began a new genre. I think if this had been the first movie in the series, it would have received better reviews. It is awfully difficult to follow a great movie with another equally great movie. All in all, this is worth seeing.
B00005JM02|2.0|We had been looking forward to enjoying this film for quite some time, as all the reviews and recommendations were glowing...<br />Yet we had to turn this film off after about twenty minutes, because it had my daughter in tears. She was up half the night from nightmares.<br />In the first five minutes of the film, Nemo's mother and all his brothers and sisters are killed. To my three year old, who doesn't understand how nature works yet (they're just somebody else's mommy and family in her mind) the scene was terrifying. After she calmed down, another violent scene would scare her to tears.<br />Granted, the animation is sparkling...perhaps the best I've ever seen, but I couldn't believe the darkness and violence that takes place in this film.<br />My wife and I watched the rest of the film after putting the little one to bed...we both found it rather dull and lifeless, with a few exceptions...certainly one of Disney's lesser efforts. It's amazing how much Disney films have deteriorated in quality in my lifetime.<br />So now I'm wondering about these glowing reviews I keep hearing and reading. Am I missing something? Now I think it truly overrated. We quickly donated this film to the local library...although I was hesitant to do so.<br />Parents, you know your children better than anybody. We strongly caution that those with kids 5 and under at least wait to show them this film...don't make the same mistake we did.
B00005JLYW|2.0|Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle<br />It should have worked.  It had all the elements of success:  a hot cast, nostalgic appeal, a retro `80s soundtrack, and plenty of action (the self-parodying, deliberately over-the-top kind). But somehow, Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle missed its mark by a mile.<br />The sequel to the original Charlie's Angels movie has the sexy trio trying to recover two stolen rings that hold the secrets of HALO, a witness protection type program.  Naturally, the bad guys are after the rings as well, which are being held hostage for the highest bidder by a mysterious third party.  Along the way, the Angels get into plenty of covert ops that require high-tech stakeouts, lowbrow cheesecake, thrilling chase scenes and spoofy kick-bum, incredible (literally, not to be believed) fight sequences.  To complicate matters, the girls are each dealing with domestic and romantic entanglements in their private lives and personal demons.  In the end, a big moral lesson is learned by all.<br />Now I realize that this type of movie is not to be taken seriously; it was after all written to be a comedy.  Even a comedy, however, needs a little more substance than the thin plot of CA:  FT.  It could be forgiven its other mistakes if only it managed to be funny on some level, but instead, we're left with that vague feeling that our intelligence was just insulted.  Even a cast with greats like John Cleese, Lucy Liu and Bernie Mac couldn't salvage the bad script, lack of plot and downright unfunny sitcom-style jokes.  Need examples?  Here:<br />John Cleese plays Liu's dad visiting from out of town, who runs into her boyfriend unexpectedly.  In true predictable tv style, the boyfriend lets slip her \\"secret\\" profession in just such a way that dad misinterprets and thinks she's a call girl.  From then on we are haunted by the painfully unfunny running joke as Liu and boyfriend innocently deliver one double entendre after another to poor suffering dad who's trying to be a good sport about it all.  Oh, the hilarity that almost ensued!<br />Bernie Mac is the new Bosley.  This normally brilliant comedian is reduced to a hammy, self-conscious buffoon that seems to have no real pupose in the organization except perhaps to underscore how smart the Angels are. Bosley fumbles around incompetently while the girls are out getting the job done, ha ha.  None of Mac's wit or wordplay is showcased here.  Why oh why was this done to Bernie?!?<br />To top it off, the \\"chemistry\\" between the Angels is forced and syrupy.  None of them manage to pull off convincing emotional interactions, but ironically this appears to be the one serious concept the writers were trying to convey.  .  After I heard the \\"we're a family\\" line for the umpteenth time I just wanted to throw the Dvd case at the tv screen.  <br />If it weren't for the fact that Kill Bill was released months after, I would have accused CA:  FT of trying to tap into this newly-created ultraviolence/comedy genre (but of course failing).  Thanks Columbia Tristar for wasting yet another two hours of my life that I won't get back!<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
0380789019|5.0|For years, I've felt that one of the chief problems with the fantasy genre is the inability of most of its writers to compose a single volume story.  Driven more by commercial considerations than any true creative need, most authors compose trilogies or even longer series of novels.  In fact, the last standalone fantasy I had read by a major author was David Eddings's awful Redemption of Althalus.  With Neverwhere, Neil Gaiman has done what is nowadays most rare:  composed a single book fantasy novel which is also good.<br />The story is about Richard Mayhew, an average enough guy living in London who sees a young woman - Door - lying injured in the streets and is compelled to help her.  Proving that no good deed goes unpunished, the act of assisting her turns his own life to hell as suddenly he more-or-less disappears from existence.  In his world, he is now invisible; instead he has become part of Door's world, a strange and magical place that lies beneath the streets.<br />There is plenty of adventure that follows, with Richard as part of Door's quest to stop the killers of her family.  On the surface, Richard is a bit of a disappointment as a character, more of an observer than a doer, a man who reacts rather than acts.  On a deeper level, however, this is actually the story of Richard's self-discovery, and how he goes from being a generic everyman to forging his own identity.  <br />But don't let this depth intimidate you; this is essentially a fun fantasy novel with what readers of such books want:  weird plances, interesting characters, scary villains and lots of action.  It makes this book not only an outstanding book in a genre that has seen better days, but also a good book in its own rights.
0385504209|1.0|I read mostly technical manuals and other dry stuff. Anyhow. Once in a blue moon I'll pick up a fiction novel.  The 1st chapter will either hook me and I can't put it down. Or it gathers dust.  This book has gathered dust. It's easy to put down and forget.  Am I crazy? Maybe I'm crazy.
B0000AXM3Q|2.0|When I heard that Iron Maiden was releasing a new album, I immediately downloaded the video from their website.  I liked the CGI-themed video, but it was hard to get much out of the song since it sounded somewhat drowned out (which is the usual fare for internet material).<br />When I finally bought the album, I discovered that the murky sound was not really an aspect of the download quality as much as it was an aspect of the mastering of the music itself.  <br />To give you the details: Bruce Dickinson's vocals were mixed in too low throughout the album, so the music drowns out his normally powerful voice.  There's no top-end in the mix, so the album lacks the crystal-clear quality of most of their work.  I'm not sure why the band wanted to mix the album like this, as it drowns out each individual element of the music like murky swamp water.  (For immediate comparison, I popped in the 13-year-old &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; album and the quality was MUCH cleaner, crisper, and better overall.)<BR>  <BR>The songs themselves are alright; a fair bit heavier and more crowded sounding than most of Maiden's works.  There are some potentially good guitar riffs, but as mentioned before the poor mix destroys the overall effect.  The coolest part of the album is the inner booklet, with each band member being haunted by sixth-sense-like ghosts.  Lyrically, the album provides more overly-written complicated stories that I've never heard of - just what the heck is Montsegur, anyway?  (I think this band must've obtained a PHD in classic literature).  <br />If you're a hardcore Iron Maiden fan, there's nothing in this review that's going to stop you from picking up this album (it's been out for a couple of months now, so you've probably picked it up already).  If you're a casual listener of Maiden, steer away from this album and pick up one of their greatest hits CDs along with Brave New World.
B00005JMFR|5.0|this movie was amazing. This movie has less fighting scenes that the first or the 2nd. Fighting as in hand to hand combat or guns and11 stuff like that. The battle against the machines to protect ZION was amazing. It was the coolest scene in movie history. ALOT better than helms deep. but it does have more action than both the matrix movies. The zion fight scene lasts about 30 min, then the battle with neo and agent smith at the end is one of the coolest fight scenes i have ever seen. This is the best movie in the matrix trilogy. THE ENDING IS REALLY GOOD, DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU IT, ITS THE BEST ENDING I HAVE EVER SEEN. This movie has amazing special effects, amazing action, and a really good ending. This movie is amazing and you must see it
B000002UJQ|5.0|this album is amazing there is one word that describes it...orgasmic
B00005RYLE|5.0|Okay,<BR>For a b movie, this movie is AWESOME. Bruce Campbell(ash) is a wimp in this movie, but the monsters are awesome and the atmosphere is creepy, and the tree raping scene is a little on the disturbing side. Overall a solid movie, scarier then the 2nd and 3rd. This movie isn't scary, but it's creepy, a good family horror movie.
0385504209|5.0|Great research: way out. For a very similar book, check out &quot;MEET MARK TWAIN.&quot;
B00006EXL5|5.0|This is an incredable cd, honestly that is simply all it is.  This band lovingly puts so much energy and emotion in this that I don't think that there is a single generic or feigned part on the whole cd.  A expert mix of hardcore, emo and punk the way it should be played and enjoyed.  My Chemical Romance expertly balances these three genres while playing memorable songs with great lyrics.  Has a sorta goth feel to it but I am fine with that in this case.  I think Drowning Lessons is definatly the best song on the cd.  I think these guys could be huge and it is a shame that people are so preoccupied with other flash in the pan acts and not focusing on true talent.  Relentless and passioned songs, this cd kills.    p.s. Man now I know what they mean when they say \\"be careful what you wish for.\\"
0790730960|5.0|As much as I like the first one, this one is that much better. This is such a great film. The acting is superb, with terrific turns by Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Phieffer, and Christopher Walken. The whole cast is brilliant. I saw this one in the movies, and it was an experience I would never forget. I just wish the DVD had some extras though.
0446310786|5.0|Maycomb was a sleepy Alabama town in the 1930's, but it was abruptly awoken when the towns &quot;white trash,&quot; accuses a black man of raping his daughter. Immediatly, the town is plunged into controversy, especially when Atticus, a well-liked white lawyer, agrees to defend the accused, Tom Robinson. Then, to further enrage many of his white neighbors, he actually does it very well and makes it clear that Tom is not the criminal.<BR>Told through the eyes of Scout, Atticus's young daughter, this shows the abrupt awakening of a town. Scout experience descrimination and hate, because her father defends the innocent. Throughout the story, she and her beloved brother Jem, and friend Dill, deal with the anger of a town but remain innocent and loving throughout the ordeal. <BR>Then, after Atticus almost succeed in getting Tom Robinson acquited, the accuser takes matters into his own hands. However, this time he attacks atticus and his family in a series of rash events, culminating in a night of horror for Scout and Jem.<BR>Those who do not read this book are missing out on one of the best books ever written.
B00006IRJU|5.0|Icehouse has always been difficult band to pigeon hole. That can be a good thing for artists, who prefer to move from style to style, genre to genre, if their writing talents are so disposed. Most songwriters will find a niche, one that's safe, self-expressive (and profitable). From its very beginnings, Icehouse moved through a variety of styles and personnel changes, culminating in the seminal &quot;Man of Colours&quot;, a near tribute to the song-writing prowess of the band's longtime frontman, Iva Davies, the seemingly only, constant member of the band.<BR>     Davies is a consummate songwriter. He has the ability to shove his heart into your face, and still reveal only what he wants to let you see. He has made his dark, quirky mind and heartfelt emotion truly available to us in this work, a collection of pop savvy melodies and haunting, atmospheric songs.<BR>     An undercurrent of insecurity seems to be pervasive in many of the tracks, such as the opener, &quot;Crazy&quot;, a wonderful pop, yet powerful song with one heck of a hook, a solid rhythm complement and great guitar sound, reminiscent of &quot;the Fixx&quot; or early James Honeyman-Scott of the &quot;Pretenders&quot;. The insecurity is found in the lyrics, not the masterful execution by the musicians, with lines such as the chorus: &quot;Yeah, you gotta be crazy, baby/ To want a guy like me/ Yeah, you gotta be out of your mind/ Crazy...&quot;<BR>     Tracks like &quot;Electric Blue&quot; continue Mr. Davies' feeling of anxiety with exposing his feelings, or would writing about those anxieties actually be his way of dealing with them(?): &quot;I just freeze/ Everytime you see through me/ And it's all over you? Electric Blue...&quot;<BR>     &quot;Man of Colours&quot;, the title track, is a smorgasbord of well documented emotion, and &quot;Heartbreak Kid&quot; is eerie, haunting, and beautiful in its execution.  This cd is a must for any Iva Davies fan, Icehouse fan, or any fan of well written pop music.
B00004Z459|5.0|Listen to the CD and you'll be blown away! The mix between Rock, Hip Hop, and Electronica is simply amazing, who woulda thought? They've become my favorite band and have been for 2 years! If your looking for something new, your in for a ride!!!
B00003CX95|5.0|BRAVEHEART focuses on the historic tale of Sir William Wallace of Elerslie, Scotland's greatest hero and patriot. During the 12th century the brutal King Edward I of England, otherwise known as Longshanks, ruled Scotland. After returning to his childhood home William Wallace had simple plans of becoming a farmer and raising a family but after English soldiers have murdered his wife his attention has focused on the English's brutal occupation of Scotland. United together with other Scottish warriors, Wallace bypasses the traditional path of negotiations and fights the English on his own terms. What follows are several well-crafted battle scenes which reveal the cruelty of war before the invention of guns that are guaranteed to either make you cringe or fascinate you. Until the capture of Wallace and his public torture and beheading his lived and fought for his beliefs, a Scotland ruled by Scots.<br />The DVD special features succeed in adding supplemental knowledge to this historical narrative. There is no doubt that director and leading actor Mel Gibson took fictional liberties with this plot as admitted in his interview. While BRAVEHEART provides a service by bringing this story to a worldwide audience, it certainly should not be interpreted as 100% truth of the life of William Wallace and the Scottish battle against Longshanks. <br />I have been a big fan of BRAVEHEART since it's theatrical release eight years ago. Not only because it portrays a little known segment of history but also because of the splendid cinematography involved. It reminds me of the beautiful landscape of the Scottish Highlands I visited around the time of this movie's release and urges me to revisit each time I watch this film. BRAVEHEART is a wonderful addition to anyone's DVD collection.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Way better than the Matrix Reloaded. This was the most exciting and dazling movie I have ever seen. It's almost like your brain is not quite able to take in all of the excitement and the visual imagery, which far surpasses anything ever shown.<br />It's not perfect, but what is?  Go for the pure enjoyment of giving your overloaded brain a rest. It doesn't have to make sense, and those who try and over analyze it will be poorer for their effort.  You don't need to analyze why chocolate tastes good. It just does.<br />Enjoy!!
B00005JMFR|3.0|I'm still trying to decide if I actually like this movie. Unlike a lot of people I really liked Reloaded. The martial arts were incredible, and I enjoyed the thinking parts too. But Revolutions doesn't bother with that.<BR>The movie opens with some vague disscusions about love and other emotions but than forgets about what makes it \\"The Matrix\\". There is one fight scene in the Matrix that is okay. It's very similar to the lobby shoot out in the first movie, but not anywhere near as original. From there on out, almost all of the movie takes place in the machine world. This could be tolerable in a normal sci-fi movie, but this is the Matrix. The war in Zion becomes a very gorey and graphic Star Wars Episode 2. There is no Bullet Time in the real world, and everyone is using large explosives rather than graceful kung-fu. There are many horribly dissgusting deaths. Yes I know that the movie is rated R, but the other two were rated R and they were no where near this violent. The war comes out to this very hellish thing. It's not that fun to watch either.<BR>Neo and Trinity take the Logos to the machine city, but on their way they have a bit of a run in with Bane/Smith. In the process Neo is blinded ,yet since he's the One, he can see some stuff (can anyone say Daredevil?). The fight between Neo and Smith is simply incredible. This is what started it all. Incredible one-on-one kung-fu insanity. Sadly, while it's the best part of the movie, it's also really short (just like the Yoda fight scene in Star Wars).<BR>Now what's weird about this one is that even though it's supposed to be the second half of Reloaded, it has an entirely different tone. In Reloaded, Neo was a bad a--. In this one he looks like he is on the verge of tears through out the whole movie (that might be because he's realized that he's gonna die while saving the world). Reloaded was clean, and beautiful, Revolutions is grity and disgusting.<BR>All that asside, this movie does what it was supposed to do. It ends the story very well, closing up pretty much all of the loose ends. Neo's determination is beautiful to watch. When it appears that he is down for the count and Smith walks around him taunting \\"Why do you continue to fight Mr. Anderson? What do you hope to accomplish? Is it love? peace? Why Mr. Anderson, why?\\" Neo responds with \\"Because I choose to.\\" It's a truly beautiful scene to watch and makes this movie, the Matrix.<BR>However there are some other things that develop into problems. The dialogue has been down graded from the Arcitecht's monologue to \\"Shoot them bastards\\". Revolutions loses the intelectual feel that all the others had.<BR>One other big problem is the blatant Christian symbolism. When Neo dies a crusifix of light appears around him. The Wachowski's have been fairly original on everything else, why that?<BR>Now should you watch it? If you're a hardcore Matrix fan than you've probably already seen it but if you haven't than go, it's worth it. If you're not a big Matrix fan than wait for the DVD. If your one of those people who is just looking for a huge war scene than wait for Return of the King.<BR>Overall, good movie, but it should have been so much more.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie is terrific.  It should be up there with the classics like &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; -- except that people don't normally think of settling down to watch movies on February 2nd!<br />The set up is wonderfully original.  A day, repeated over and over, and not even a nice day, not even a special day, but February 2nd, in a small town in Pennsylvania, in a place our weatherman hates.  And our weatherman fights against it in every which way he can -- trying to amuse himself with stealing money, riding on railroad tracks, using his knowledge to sleep with women (heck, he only has one day in which he can woo them), theorizing that he has to kill the groundhog in order to end his repetitious hell, and finally trying to kill himself, over and over, out of despair.  Finally he learns to accept it, uses his time wisely, and then starts truly giving to people, becomes a real member of the town which he originally hated.<br />The idea could have gotten old, though, if the acting or the directing had been less than perfect, but it is not; it is wonderful instead, with nuance after nuance.  Even when it feels forced, as if Bill Murray is acting, it works, because our weatherman would have felt as if he were acting as he repeated the day over and over.  One of the sweetest moments comes near the end as Murray says: &quot;I said stay and you stayed?  I can't even make a collie stay.&quot;<br />Most of all, it makes you think, with dîalogue like: &quot;I'm a God.  I'm not THE God.  At least, I don't think I am...&quot; and &quot;Maybe God doesn't have any special powers, either.  Maybe he's just been around a long time...&quot; and Andie's question: &quot;Is this what you do with eternity?&quot;<br />Worth seeing.  Over and over.
0385504209|5.0|This is definitely one of the most exciting, fast paced, and easy to follow fiction I have ever read.  This book also sparked a number of interest for me, i.e. Dead Sea Scrolls, Da Vinci, and the origin of Christianity.  Every chapter was like a scene in a movie.  I highly recommend this book, to both religious and non religious people!
B00005JKOV|4.0|I don't think a lot of the people reviewing this film \\"get it\\".  It doesn't have a storyline in the usual sense - that much is true.  But there is a point to it - I just don't think the people rating it one star understand it.  You have to watch it to the very end.  It is visually stimulating although I can understand why many would easily tire of this type of animation.  For the length of the film it is basically one person listening to others' philosophical ramblings.  I think some people are turned off by this because they don't necessarily understand all of the ramblings or perhaps they need a more distinct storyline.  Is it a great film? - no.  Is it interesting both visually and intellectually? - yes.  Did I agree with all of the philosophies cited during it? - no, it would be impossible since many of them conflict with each other.  It's meant to be eye opening.<br />...
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I assume that many fans of the Strokes may be a bit dissapointed with &quot;Room on Fire&quot;.  After all,  it has the very tough time of trying to live up to the previous album &quot;Is this It&quot;.  And whie it may not be as instantly catchy as that album, it is still a very good follow up.  In fact in some ways it's better.  The Strokes have, for the most part, created an album that retains the sound of the first album, while expanding on it. Some of the songs, such as &quot;12:51&quot;, evoke more of a New Wave sound than 70's cool, while others, like the terrific &quot;Under Control&quot; (easily their best song to date) have an almost  Mo-town feel to them. It is different than any thing heard on &quot;Is this It&quot;, yet it still manages to soud like the Strokes,<BR>   Fabrizzio Morreti and Nick Valensi have become the bands all-stars on this album. Fab's drums are on point<BR>on every song, and he knows when to hold back (Under Control) as well as let loose (I Can't Win).  As well, Nick seems to have been experimenting with his guitar since the last album, making it sound at times almost like a keyboard  (12:51)<BR>   Although the album does have it's week points (Julian sounds like he is singing from a phone booth again) and it does not sound quite as fresh as the previous album, it is still exciting, and shows that, for the time being, the Strokes still got it.  And if songs like &quot;Autostop&quot; and the upbeat &quot;I can't win don't put a smile on your face, than nothing will.
B00009V7P8|5.0|The first song I heard from this album was Amie. Upon first listen I knew I had to get the album.  Unfortunately it wasn't avaliabe in the US then.  Thankfully it is now, and everyone needs to own it.  The album is light and folksy...the perfect album to play when you are in a mellow mood. Here is a look at some of the songs:<br />Volcano - The albums big single, featuring beautiful cello and female vocal accompaniment from the lovely Lisa Hannigan<br />Blower's Daughter - Poignant and beautiful, one of my favorites.<br />Cannonball - Hopefully a future US single, this is the most radio friendly song<br />Amie - Totally unabashadly beautiful.<br />I Remember - Damien's best song to hear live.<br />Eskimo - A powerful closing song featuring a lovely bit of Finnish opera singing.<br />It's not just the CD that is great...Damien Rice puts on a better live show than anyone I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot).  Do yourself a favor and see him live, where he tends to play a lot more rockin' songs that are planned to be released on a future album.
B00004YZFQ|5.0|A lot of people seem to be reviewing the event rather than the film and how well the film documents it.  Of course the event was stupid, poorly planned, and evil, and I'm sure the Stones aren't proud of it...and the film captures all those things perfectly.<br />This film is more interesting to me than Woodstock (still excellent), mainly because it has an aura of evil around it (evil is more interesting than peace and love on screen obviously).  The impending doom makes the whole thing incredibly creepy.  Though I love the music, it appropriately isn't placed as the centerpiece of the film; the cultural significance is focused on instead.<br />The stabbing and other fights aren't overly graphic, so like a classic horror movie the horror is created in the viewer's mind.  This ends up being brilliant, although probably due to lack of footage rather than necessarily a directorial decision.<br />Another interesting aspect is the way in which the rich and famous performers are thrust into being &quot;equals&quot; with the crowd (as when the Jefferson Airplane guitarist gets punched-out by security, or the dog walks carelessly across the stage ignoring Jagger).  Often it's even humorous in an &quot;adding insult-to-injury&quot; way, and gives the viewer the sense of helplessness everyone there must have had.<br />I'd say this should be on a viewing list for documentary film classes, but it already is....
039472903X|4.0|Good overview of advertising and how it works.  Somewhat out of date at this stage.
0375703764|1.0|...doesn't mean you should say it.  The problem with House of Leaves, like most post-modern scribblings, is that the \\"author\\", completely bereft of any literary talent, has to resort to gimmickry and kitsch with which to entice his audience.  Sure, it's imaginative, but it's not true literature.  Why?  For one thing, there's no plot.  One of the more important components of literature is an actual storyline that hooks the reader.  House of Leaves doesn't concern itself with such triviality.  Nor does it attempt to develop memorable characters or even coherent prose.  Instead, Leaves is merely an amalgam of everything that is wrong with modern culture -- flashy, experimental, and downright irritating.  Danielewski prides himself on his \\"film like\\" construction of the book, but this leaves one wondering -- if he was intent on forging a unique cinematic experience, why not pick up a camera?  The fact is, Danielewski doesn't know the first thing about film, literature, or anything resembling appreciable art; his strengths lie in experimenting with typography and cryptography -- not exactly gripping reading material.  Like most \\"high-concept\\" art, House of Leaves is nothing more than a house of cards -- a poorly constructed shell slapped together with whiz-bang novelties and tossed in the general direction of the public.  The blow-in card advertising his sister's cacophonous rock band was a nice touch, rounding out the complete corporate-sellout handbook.  I suppose if you read Joyce's Finnegan's Wake on a regular basis or are currently matriculating at The New School, then House of Leaves might just be your taste.  However, the rest of us should go in search of something more fulfilling.
B000065LZO|5.0|I cannot understand why this album was never recognized as one of U2's best. Maybe it was that they mixed live with recorded, new with old. Maybe it was just because of the movie that came out with it that didn't do so well at the box office. Or maybe once again it was because great art wasn't appreciated in its time. I have both this album and the DVD version of Rattle and Hum and absolutely love them both. At first, when I heard the album I was a little thrown off by the live songs mixed in with brand new recordings. But then I realized that this album was a testament to what true rock and roll bands are all about. To be the best band in the world - which they were arguably considered to be at the time and have always since been in my opinion - you need three key things: songs of substance, great live performances and, yes, singles to rise on the charts so a huge audience can hear it and agree that it is amazing. While popularity is rarely seen (especially today) as a testament to good music, U2 successfully managed to avoid falling into the hazards of fame and still went out and put on an amazing show. The incredible rendition of &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; with the Voices of Freedom gives me chills, and &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; is a song that has to be heard live to feel just what U2 is putting into it. They are one of the few bands that could ever really convey what they were feeling in the studio recordings and manage to evoke real emotions in people with their albums. But I doubt if anyone out there will disagree with me when I say that they go way way beyond that in their live performances, attesting to their greatness. Songs like &quot;Hawkmoon 269&quot; and &quot;God Part II&quot; are some of my favorites because of this ability to force the audience to feel. I love this album, but don't think I can rate it in relation to U2's others. Masterpieces tend to be few and far between, but you can always predict their arrival when you hear U2 is in the studio again.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I can't believe how bad the lines and story was.  Not near enough fighting, just abunch of pointless .... that didn't amount to anything.  By far the worst of the 3 and left a very bad taste in my mouth about the Matrix trilogy.
B0000060NH|5.0|Every since I found this CD I have had a different perspective on Marvin Gaye.  Most scores from movies are full of instruments and movements.  Marvin is a an instrument.  Move over McFerrin!  MG can do that too!  You will love this masterpiece of music.  By the way, listen to it when you're doing absolutely nothing.  It will help you think better.
0385504209|2.0|If it didn't waste so many words and so much of the readers time this book might be tolerable. The author should cut to the chase, give the reader a more rounded story and quit wasting the readers time.

0385504209|1.0|OK I finally gave into the hype and decided to read it.  By the end of the first chapter it was obvious the writing had serious flaws.  Clumsy sentences.  Awkward writing.  It is an interesting subject that is true.  And these ancient historical conspiracies are facinating.  But these are covered so much better in other books, several of which are mentioned in the &quot;recommended instead of&quot; section.  I started reading a couple of them and the difference in the quality of the writing is quite striking.  It is one thing to be a good researcher and another thing to be a good writer or novelist.
B00005JM02|5.0|What a delightful movie!<br />Okay so seeing Nemo's mom and siblings gobbled up by a hungry underwater predator in the first few minutes of the show made me have nightmares for a month but other than that I loved every single minute of this animated fantasy.<br /><br /> The plot is simple and fun.  Nemo is a little clown fish with a weak and undersized flipper who wants to prove to his Dad, the over protective Marlin that he is grown-up enough to start school.  Unfortunately things go wrong on the first day of school and Nemo is captured by a scuba diving dentist who takes him away in a boat and it is up to Marlin to rescue him and he sets out on an adventure of a lifetime.<br /><br />Marlin meets up with the attention deficit blue tang fish Dory, voiced over by the wonderful comedienne Ellen DeGeneres and we are treated to a roller coaster ride of fun, laughter and tears as Marlin sets forth into the world beyond the safety of his coral reef home.<br /><br /> Other wonderful characters include Bruce the Vegetarian shark, the hippy like Sea Turtle who gives Marlin good advice, the friendly pelican, and Gill the scarred Warrior Angel Fish (William Defoe) who is forced to live in a fish tank and constantly dreams of escape.<br /><br />Little Nemo's fate is to end up in a tank with a group of disparate fish and crustaceans who long to flee the confines of their glass prison.  Led by Gill, Nemo finally realises his own potential as he strives to escape the clutches of Darla, the Dentist's psychotic young niece who thinks that the world and its fish are hers to scare to death.<br /><br /> There are many hysterically funny moments, such as Dory trying to speak whale, the seagulls who screech \\"Mike, Mike\\" all the time and try to make a meal of Marlin and Dory, along with heart stopping moments such as the ride through a wall of jelly fish and a trip in a whale's stomach.<br /><br /> This is a great film for the whole family, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.  Go and see it, and enjoy!see it, and enjoy!
6305433909|5.0|I've read all of the reviews on   SA2 and it is quite obvious this movie is not for everyone, however, if you enjoy &quot;feel good &quot; movies , this is for you. The storyline iis quite predictable, the acting is good , but the music is a delightful bonus,just wish there was more of it. I know that if I'm feeling a little down, I can pop in this movie and feel better.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|sure it's changed but why so many complaints? in the right direction i believe she went. mellow .. nice .. relaxing .. and if you actually read her lyrics .. meaningful. each new listen i grow to love it more. simply a quiet, beautiful and content CD in the music of Sarah.
B0000DJZ9T|2.0|I loved Coldplay's other two albums, but I have never heard such crap!  I am ashamed to say that it is not worth the money.  He sings out of tune and can't harmonize for crap!  Five stars come on people...rate the CD not the Band!
B000002MG1|5.0|I have been following REM since they got their start and they were just another Athens band that would appear in Atlanta periodically.  I have watched them develop overtime and can say with a great deal of confidence that this marks their peak as artists.  Some people describe this as a bit of downer, much as I am sure the same people would term Bach cello concertos as depressing.  There are no &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; type songs on this CD, but what is here is profound, melodious and ultimately life affirming.
B000002AH7|3.0|When I was in college struggling to build a CD collection that would convince visitors to my room that I was cool, I got two Miles Davis albums that I thought made the best impression: Kind of Blue and Sketches of Spain.  Since then, I am thankfully much less concerned with what people think of me, I've listened to Kind of Blue hundreds of times, and Sketches of Spain...I'm not sure...maybe twenty times, and haven't had the urge to pick it off the shelf for the past two years.  Why do I never feel like listening to it, even though the music was enjoyable?<br />I think I figured out the reason when I stumbled across the actual Rodrigo Concierto de Aranjuez on a CD of classical guitar pieces.  It really is a beautiful piece.  What surprised me was how similar it was to the version on Sketches of Spain.  Miles's version was essentially the same piece arranged for jazz band: nothing particularly exciting was done to the music, and any changes in the harmony that took place with the transposition of instruments were, if anything, to the detriment of the music.  There's a reason this piece was, after all, written for guitar.<br />The rest of the album-with the exception of Solea-gives me the same impression.  It's a fan letter to Spain; it recreates their music without creating anything new or vital.  I remember reading in the liner notes that the recording of this album was plagued with difficulties, because Miles kept showing up late to sessions without being adequately prepared.  Now, I don't know how he acted during the sessions that created Kind of Blue, In a Silent Way, or Miles Smiles-but I have a feeling it wasn't like that.  Those records bristle with enthusiasm and energy: everyone in them was fully committed to what was being done.<br />But I can sort of tell, when I listen to this, why Miles wasn't totally into Sketches of Spain.  There's barely any room to breathe inside these arrangements-the improvisatory feel of the jazz that Miles was best at is gone.  His freedom is basically limited to a few sections of primary melody, and that within an idiom of music that he isn't totally comfortable with.  When you listen to this album, little phrases and melodies don't stick in your head the way they do with Kind of Blue; instead, what you come away with is a vaguely pleasant feeling.<br />What this is, then, is nice background music.  And you can play great music for atmosphere, but if it's actually great, eventually it'll get your attention again and again and distract you from whatever it is you were doing.  This one just plays until it's over and then goes back on the shelf, the same as those lame world music albums people get to \\"relax.\\"  Well, it's better than those.  But still: only get this if you have the great Miles albums.  I mentioned a few.
B000002HMH|5.0|I think both Load and Re load are great albums. The groove and the lyrics are great (Hetfields eternal struggle with his inner demons). But the problem is the bands past. They had great albums before this one, and the obvious tendency is to compare them to these. Every artist MUST change, because mantaining as ther were is a sign of mediocricy(I dontt know if is spelled like this). <BR>This is a GREAT album
B000002U8G|4.0|Most fall into Pink Floyd starting out with Darkside of the Moon.  The natural progression based on album popularity probably continues on with The Wall, Wish You Were Here, Pulse, Animals, The Division Bell, and so on with many different permutations.  Meddle is my favorite of the &quot;less popular&quot; Floyd albums although as any Amazon regular will know, a product with 225 reviews is not neccesarily a &quot;hidden gem&quot;.<br />Meddle is the album that came before Darkside of the Moon and is a little less refined and which works in it favor.  The album is essentialy a three song album as tracks 2 and 4 will quickly be regulars on the short end of the skip button.  <br />One of These Days opens the album up with a driving bass line that is soon joined by some exquisite slide guitar and finishes srong with a rocking riff that will be sure to have you air guitarring your arm off.  Song number three is called Fearless.  Its an acoustic masterpiece with lyrical signifigance to boot.  The riff is so clear is sounds like its being played in your head and the song has a soothing sense to it everytime you hear it.  The fifth songs is the epic masterpiece that is Echoes.  It about 25 minutes long and besides an annoying three minutes in the middle (whale sounds are so creepy) its spectacular.  Very complex and needs to be heard to be believed.  The song is the perfect example of tension release and build up it is the sacred dogma of stoners around the world.<br />Bottom line:  A spectacular 35 minutes of music that new Floyd fans may not have experienced.
6305903182|3.0|This is the 3rd in the great sereies ( trilogy ) and it shows... it's good, but not near as good as Scream 1 or 2. This is the long awaited for END, and it does good. But some of it could have been better.<br />Sydney is living on her own as a womans crisis counciler, and the 3rd STAB movie is coming out ( what happened to #2? )And she can't be found by her killer ( or so she thought ) and back on the stage of STAB 3, the bodies pile up of the CAST of STAB 3 but none  of SCREAM. SO they are being killed in the order they die in the movie ( STAB ) and police believe that it is by someone on the crew. Adn questions come up when they read about  3 different scripts to keep the ending from getting on the internet. SO they don't know which one the killer read, and so goes the story and it is greatly combined with Sydney's long lost brother, who wanted to get back at her for the life she stole from him...so the story goes....<br />This one was packed with comedy, which I greatly enjoyed. It made me laugh out loud. The only problem is they did not kill off cast from the origional SCREAM. I was thinking, what a great twist if Gale or Dewy, heck even Sydney, gets offed in this one. That would have been fun! But it was still good. I reccomend eithe fo the first 2 before this. But it does do justice to a great series!

0425170349|4.0|This selection by Tom Clancy was an excellent read.  Like most of Clancy's books it started off a little slow for me but in the end was a book I would recommend to anyone interested in this type of literature. Even if you have never read anything by Clancy this is one that would be good to start off with, it is full of action and adventure, just be sure you have enough time to sit down and read it within a rather short period of time.  If you read only a chapter or two every two weeks or so like a friend of mine did then you will not get the true effect of the book because you forget so much information and have to go back and re-read the previous chapter just to remember where you were.

0743216458|4.0|In his book \\"Band of Brothers\\" Stephen Ambrose tells the story of C Company, 506 PIR, 101st Airborne.  He starts with how the company came to gather and moves on to their battle in Normandy, Belgium, Germany and Austria. Ambrose does a very good job writing this book. He uses quotes from interviews of the members of the Company in the book.  This book shows how; throw determination, well, loyalty, self-discipline and personal courage, normal people from across the country can come to gather and defeat evil and keep this country free. I would recomind this book to anyone and to read any of Stephen Ambrose's books.
B000063DIR|1.0|The original recording would have got 5 stars but they ruined it by rerecording the bass and drums with people that were 10 years old when this album was originally released.  What a slap in the face to the original artists, what a slap in the face to the fans, what a slap in the face to Randy Rhoads who is now playing alongside people he never met.<br />Ozzy is a joke.  Call it a day and give us our real Diary of a Madman back!!!
B00005JLXE|3.0|Before I go into any kind of criticism I wanted to make it a point to point out the good in Daredevil, because there's really a lot there to enjoy.<br />I LOVED ... I mean ... LOVED the origin story in the beginning.  It was PERFECT absolutely perfect.  I can't say it enough, although a character or two was missing, they perfectly captured the spirit of what made Daredevil such an appealing character.<br />The casting was pretty good, Ben Affleck (I though) was a terrific Matt Murdock/Daredevil.  I felt that although Jennifer Garner looked amazing as Electra, her performance came across a little rigid, as if she couldn't relax into the role.  Colin Ferrell was hysterical as Bullseye.  Ferrell was clearly having the time of his life making the movie.  Michael Clarke Duncan was OK as Kingpin...<br />The stunts and 'shadow-vision' and effects, I enjoyed them all.  I also LOVED all of the little nods to the comic book readers such as Frank Miller and Kevin Smith's cameo, seeing long-time artist John Romita's name as Jack Murdock's opponent.  <br />I loved the coy interaction between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson or Matt Murdock and Electra.  I ate it all up, I just couldn't get enough.<br />But of all the things they could have possibly slipped on, how did they actually slip on the character of Daredevil?  They turned him into Batman for God's sake!  Daredevil isn't a dark brooding anti-hero.  He's the guy you see leaping off of a twenty-story building without a net with a big grin on his face.  He's Spiderman without the Spider.  <br />I was actually heartbroken that they had built up this insane amount of positive momentum and then lost it all when they turned Daredevil into a cold-blooded killer.  I know they incorporated it into the storyline of Daredevil &quot;finding himself&quot; but it was just so far out of his character it bordered on being unforgivable for me.  Try as I might I really had a hard time getting past it; especially in light of how much they got right.<br />Not a bad movie by any stretch, I'd still look forward to seeing a sequel, but it definitely has flaws.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|this is a solid record.  it falls in line with her other stuff and is exactly what you'd expect.  all in all, not spectacular, but still head and shoulders above most everything else currently on the radio.   <br />that said, the copy protection on this record is irritating.  i have a portable MP3 player that does not play WMA files.  the DRM will not allow me to convert the album to MP3.  since i do not have a cd player in my car (where i do the majority of my music listening), the album is of little use to me.  i think i'm going to return it and buy something else; something without copy protection.  maybe i'll just download it off of kazaa.  <br />there should be warning stickers on the record telling me that they have DRM, that way i could avoid buying them.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|As a compilation, &quot;Hit&quot; is certainly *not* definitive, as some reviewers here have attested, but my complaint stems from the consistent historical revisionism (also present on &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot;)in which Gabriel acts like his first two albums don't exist outside of &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; (and, perhaps, &quot;Here Comes The Flood&quot;, although the 1990 version is included here).  There were some great tracks scattered on those efforts, including &quot;Humdrum&quot;, &quot;On The Air&quot; and &quot;Mother Of Violence&quot;, and no compilation (outside of &quot;Revisited&quot;, which focused specifically on those first two albums) has addressed them.  <br />If the first two albums are ignored, his last two--&quot;Ovo&quot; and &quot;Up&quot;--are over-emphasized, with three tracks taken from the little known, Euro-only &quot;Ovo&quot; and a whopping five from the just-released &quot;Up&quot;.  Although both were good albums, and it's nice to see fine overlooked compositions like &quot;Father, Son&quot;, &quot;Downside Up&quot; and &quot;The Drop&quot; given their due, it still seems like PG just wants to forget his illustrious past and concentrate on the present.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the relative dearth of tracks from the essential PGIV (&quot;Security&quot;); where's the minor hit &quot;I Have The Touch&quot;, or the crowd-pleaser &quot;Lay Your Hands On Me&quot;, for example?  As for his popular 1992 album &quot;Us&quot;, I would've thought &quot;Come Talk To Me&quot; (which was even used in that phone commercial) would have been preferred over the repetitive &quot;Love To Be Loved&quot;. <br />The quality of Gabriel's work (and I am a fan of that work from his earliest days in Genesis right through &quot;Up&quot;) has been so high that even if &quot;Hit/Miss&quot; is not definitive, it is still filled with mostly classic cuts.  The new track, &quot;Burn You Up Burn You Down&quot;, is nice, although it seems a bit presumptuous to include it in the &quot;Hit&quot; CD.  So, although it is recommended, I would strongly suggest checking out the first two albums and &quot;Security&quot; in their entirety as well, for these are severely underrepresented in favor of more recent material.
B00006LIRI|5.0|This newest collection of U2's 'hits' from the 1990s is better than the last greatest hits CD of theirs but I have to say that I feel dissapointed with this newest release from them. <br /> While most of the pre-1997 hits are not touched on here and thankfully unaltered on here, the singles from their vastly underrated &quot;Pop&quot; album are redone and these new versions of them particularly &quot;Discotheque&quot; are inferior to their original versions. Not that they're bad, just the originals are far better. <br /> &quot;Hold Me THrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me&quot; is an awesome song from an awesome movie. It's the only great soundtrack song on this collection in my opinion. THe other one &quot;Hands that Built America&quot; is kinda boring in my opinion. <br />THis is a decent if seriously flawed album of their's. Worth having nonetheless
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|Although vastly overplayed and overly-worshipped in the past year or so--to the point of nausea--there's no denying this band's ability.  I have been a fan from their debut on, and have collected just about every obscure b-side and live cut there is, <BR>which are all superb, but there comes a point (maybe this happened with The Beatles at one time, I don't know), where the amount of airplay the band receives (radio, television, etc.) simply begins to reach a certain saturation point.  The only thing a band can do at this juncture of success is to keep releasing quality product, to keep themselves constantly fresh, but release it at slightly longer intervals to give audiences time to adjust.<br />By that strategy, this live DVD may seem to be coming a little to soon in their career (after only two albums?), but it's quality is such that it still renews my faith in the group.  Coldplay are trying very hard to project the same sense of wide-eyed idealism, musical and political, that invested U2 in their early years, and although not quite at their mentor band's level, they're getting there.  The concert film is superb, all of the songs are terrific, and the three new songs are equally as strong as the standards.  The editing is stylized enough to keep Chris Martin's sometimes gangly on-stage dancing from being a distraction, and his vocals have hit a peak.  My only complaint is that many of the songs sound virtually identical to their studio counterparts, although a few are changed around a little (ie the harmonica on &quot;Don't Panic&quot;).  Although I do not wish the band to keep recycling their early sound on future efforts, for the moment &quot;Live 2003&quot; serves its purpose and reminds one of their new crown in the pop heirarchy.

B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones has a wonderful voice.  I bought the CD for her signiture song &quot;I don't know why&quot;, it's a great piece.  However, after listening to the album I found that she imitates in great detail Phoebe Snow.  Ever listened to Phoebe?  Phoebe is GREAT jazz listening AND she varies her songs enough that there are even some that make you want to get up and dance to.  Another talent that Norah seems to be imitating is Sade.  Sleeping songs that all run together.  I think in time Norah is going to have a great impact on the music world and will make her own mark instead of standing in the shadows of others.  In order to do this though she is going to have to develop her OWN sound.

B000002LCE|4.0|Dream Evil is argueably Dio's last strong album until Magica was released in 2001. Every album after until then just didn't measure up. Dream Evil is more reminesent of Dio's first two albums Holy Diver and The Last IN Line ratehr than Sacred Heart. There's less keyboards and more guitars. Like previous albums, Dream Evil kicks off with a fast track entitled Night People (one of the best tracks on the CD) and is followed by the solid title track. Sunset Superman has good guitars but suffers from a somewhat awkward chours (sunset superman?). The fouth track All the Fools Sailed Away si one of the best songs Dio has ever wrote. Other than an awkward keybord towars teh end of the song, it is nearly perfect. The rest of the CD is solid Dio metal music. Dio fans will be pleased and so will metal fans in general. Check out the awsome cover art. Gives new meaning to &quot;Sleep Tight.&quot;
0790729342|5.0|The Road Warrior is one of those rare sequels that actually improves in every concievable way to the previous movie.  The first Mad Max was well concieved, but ultimately, the low budget hindered it in many places.  Not so with the Road Warrior, the story, the characters and especially the action are more exciting and interesting than the first.  <br />Developing the post-apocalyptic theme of the first Mad Max, Max is wondering around the Austrailian desert looking for gas and eventually helps a group of people trying to protect their home, possessions and above all gas from a ruthless gang of bikers who look like they were cast from a local leather bar.<br />While the story sounds fairly generic, the characters and plot rise above what one would normally expect from B-movie action/adventures.  However, the real selling point, of course, is still the action.  The chase scene at the end, in my opinion, has never been equaled in cinema as far as sheer terror, dread and excitement as the bikers slowly try and demolish the semi-truck driven by Max. <br />Although the DVD itself is given the spartan treatment as far as extras are concerned, the movie itself is more than enough to warrant purchasing it.  A worthy addition to any action fan's library.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I really wish there was more music like Jack Johnson out there and more importantly that it was appreciated. This album is really amazing. The songs flow together beautifully and each track has a laid back feel that are close to perfection. This is one of those albums that you wish you had written the songs. Basically its just Jack and a guitar. Songs range from just plain acoustic rock to reggae influenced tracks to songs with bongos. This is also a beach feeling record that evokes images of sand and the ocean.  Anyone who like Ben Harper or Dave Matthews Band will really appreciate this record.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I thought this film really did a good job of ending the trilogy. But what makes me mad is the fact that so many people say it was a horrible way to end it because they still don't understand it. LISTEN: the Matrix is the dream world that was created by robots for who took over the world when they overpowered man. THAT IS WHAT THE MATRIX IS. The real world is what remains from when the machines banished man from there cities and put them into oval like structures that they grow the humans in. THAT IS WHAT THE REAL WORLD IS. Neo is the prophet who is believed to end the war between the robots and the machines for control. The agents are programs inside the computer dream world who destroy any body who is unplugged in the matrix and tries to liberate the humans. Unplugged people are the people who have been taken out of there hibernation in the real world and taken to the last city where all the unplugged people are. They jack in and out of the matrix with phones. Programs, like the Frenchman and the oracle, are people with specific jobs for the matrix. They have special abilities in the matrix and some try to stop the machines, some try to help them. Agent Smith is a machine who used to be an agent. After he was destroyed in the first film, he had to return to the source. The source is a place in the real world where the programs are made and sent into the matrix to carry out specific tasks. When Smith refused to go back to the source, he went back into the matrix to become a very powerful program. And the Twin thing who can mutate into ghosts; they can do that because THEY ARE PROGRAMS, NOT A CHEESY WAY TO MAKE IT COOL, THAT IS THEIR SPEACIAL ABILITY. The architect is a person who created the matrix. He built the other six matrix's and destroyed them because they turned out to be a problem. And there are only three agents in the film, they can morph from body to body but they have to move out of one body to get to the other (there can't be two of the same agent at one time). SO GET IT YOU SMART ALICS. There is more but I don't have enough space to write it all. But still, the third film was a very good and interesting to end it. Though the ending allows a sequel to be in order, but as a devoted matrix fan.......enough is enough.
B00005JMFR|1.0|I saw and loved the firt Matrix!  Excellent Sci-Fi!  It was a smart, fun and entertaining thrill ride, (and as far as I'm concerned, COMPLETE as a story!  We left Neo finding his place in the big scheme of things and flying off into the future with our imaginations flying off with him knowing, just knowing he would conquer all...great ending!). Applause.<br />I tried to sit through Matrix Reloaded and left half-way through the ponderous flapping of yaps, the half-naked Rave mud-dancing human masses, (why would anyone want to save these people????); love-making with bodies covered in pain-inducing computer jacks, (ewwwwwww!!!); superman on crack scenes and Sybil, The Split Personality Disorder AI. According to some people, I didn't like this film because I'm not smart enough to understand what was going on...sigh.  (And funny how square-jawed the entertainment industry is about people pirating their goods but still aren't willing to give you your money back when they make a product you're dissatisfied with).  I decided Matrix Revolutions would just waste more money so I'm not bothering with it.  My reasons are these:  <br />I found out AFTER trying to sit through Matrix Reloaded that the the Wachowski brothers had chosen to elaborate on  their \\"vision\\" of the first Matrix across different types of media: an anime cartoon, (sigh); a first person shooter, (fps), video game, (YUK!); Matrix Reloaded, (questions asked of unanswerable questions so we can all once again Zen ourselves into the...insert echo here...\\"Wormhole of the Unanswerable\\"...snore...); Matrix Revolutions, (I read the reviews and confirmed my suspicions I would waste my money seeing it); and finally The Matrix Online,with a monthly subscription fee, of course.  (WARNING: MOVIE SPOILER AHEAD. And ask yourselves now why Matrix Revolutions had so many new added characters that went nowhere and the matter of the machines controlling the world was not resolved and they conveniently killed off the two most powerful characters so you wouldn't be able to play them online...hmmmm...loose ends to be tied up in the online game?)<br />In order for us to \\"get it\\", that is, the vision the Wachowski brothers have of the Matrix we should have, must currently and should be in the future buying and pondering all these money-making schemes to tie it all up in one nice neat package of understanding.  This was a bad plan for someone like me who isn't interested in anime, fps' and will in no way pay a monthly fee for yet another online game.  I just don't have the resources, interest and/or the patience to invest in such disjointed story-telling.  (If you're the kind of person that does have all these things, more power to ya :) and enjoy!) But what the whole franchise has done for me is come off as one great Sci-Fi classic, two follow-ups that died and ended up in Sequel Hell and some Christmas gifts I hope I don't get this year!  Please, Santa...I've been bad...very, very baaaad.<br />Note to the Wachowsky brothers:  If in the future you decide this is a very good idea to once again break your story-telling up into bits and pieces spread all over the map WARN US AHEAD OF TIME and I'll look elsewhere for entertainment.  And, oh by the way, your \\"deux ex machina of advertising\\" was very wise to open with Matrix Revolutions everywhere in the world at once; even if it flops all involved will have at least made their money back.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I really like this album. Sure, the first time I listened to it, I didn't get it. Now I see that it is a truly classic album that was unfortunately released with so many B-sides that nobody could hear the meat and potatos of the record. True, it is more expensive than the other Clash albums, but I really think it's worth the investment.<br />To me the albums winning tracks are; police on my back, the call up, Washington bullets, broadway, Charlie dont surf, Kingston Advice, The street parade, the magnificent seven, Junco Partner, Something about England, The crooked Beat, Somebody got murdered, One more time/dub, Lightning strikes, Up in Heaven, Corner Soul (REALLY GOOD SONG), Let's go Crazy.<br />That's a lot of good music. The other tracks are good too, just consider them bonus tracks or something. The Clash is a legend in our time. Don't shoot yourself in the foot by calling this album bad.
B00005OM4N|1.0|uh huh, yes. that's right, yes. i give it a 1, and here's why. i spend too much time masturbating to this music to actually listen to the music. yes.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This is single-handedly the best album I have ever heard.  In terms of completeness, style, musicality, lyric -- it's got the entire package.  The string melodies in songs like &quot;Amie&quot; add to the flavor, while his almost desperate, purley heart-felt lyrics add to the greatness.  If I had one album to recomend for the year, it would be &quot;O&quot; by Damien Rice.  The biggest climax is probably in Eskimo, but you should buy it and listen to it, I won't ruin it for you.
B00004XOWM|1.0|There's a sucker born every minute and Fred Dirt proved it when he released this cd of trash. This cd is terrible and millions of suckers went out and bought it. I can understand buying it because you was fooled to think that Fred had something to offer, but to buy it and STILL like it?! No excuse!! I will admit, I liked their &quot;Significant Other&quot; cd, but that's it. Its no wonder why some kids are so brain dead...they are listening to junk bands like Limp Bizkit.
B0000C7PRY|2.0|I bought this CD based on Mike Portnoy's praise of it on the Dream Theater Web site. What a mistake. This should ahve beened release on a christian label instead of Metal Blade. <br />I have listened to it at least 20 times and I just cannot get into it. Very nice orchastrations (if you like that), but this is definitively not progressive rock! The lyrics are way to personnal for prog. Neil Morse should have written a autobiography book instead of recording is soul.<br />Disc 1's got a few good moment at the start but then MOR songs are inserted between prog tracks. Disc 2 is all MOR.<br />Morse is a great composer and musician (check out any previous Spock's Beard or Transatlantic release). This is evident here also but not in a progressive way. This set is multi-layered orchastrations molded around the christian lyrics. The music never leads the way.<br />If you want progressive rock, DO NOT BUY this set.
B00005JMFI|3.0|\\"Elf,\\" the new Christmas family film, stars Will Farrell as Buddy, a would-be elf.  It seems Buddy was an orphan who sneaked into Santa's bag, was taken to his workshop, and adopted by elf Bob Newhart.  Now Buddy is grown up, and he goes to New York City to meet his biological father (played by James Cann), and the predictable problems of an innocent elf in the big city begin.<br /><br />Parts of this movie are very likeable:  Will Farrell is charming and likeable as Buddy.  Bob Newhart is equally loveable and funny as the Papa Elf. Ed Asner was an odd choice as a grumpy, cold, and definitely not jolly, Santa Claus.  James Cann is dull as Buddy's biological father, a serious, unscrupulous children's book publisher. The middle section of the movie, which focuses on Cann's business problems, was tedious for me.  Will Farrells' scenes are joyful, however, and his fans will certainly enjoy \\"Elf.\\"
0385504209|2.0|This book started out with a bang: a thriller of a first chapter. I had such high hopes. But the further I read, the more disgusted I became. The plot and the theology became more and more sensational and outrageous. Dan Brown certainly has a right to express his views on church history and theology, but as a conservative Christian, I personally found it offensive. I would imagine most Catholics would take offense at the corrupt and negative characterization of the Church. I went away from the book with a sick feeling.
B00005JM0B|5.0|This movie by far is the best one yet.Even though James Cameron<BR>didn't direct this one we needed a new director anyways to see new things in the episode.This movie is action packed I went to the theaters the day it came out and I love this movie . I'm going to add this 3rd installment to my other 2 dvd's of the Terminator collection I think you should too.2 thumbs up!!!!!!!!<BR>5 stars!!!!
B00005JM02|5.0|Although Nemo is a great movie, my comment is more about ordering DVDs from Amazon.com<br />I pre-ordered DVD Finding Nemo from Amazon.com hoping that I will get the DVD same day its in market. <br />To my surprise, I got the DVD 2-3 days AFTER it was in market. While other kids were showing off their Nemo DVD, my daughter had to wait coz I ordered from Amazon.<br />Another thing which bothered me was that while I paid  $22.42 for the DVD, Walmart was selling the exact same DVD for 14.95.<br />I learnt my lesson, that I wont ever pre-order my DVDs from you guys again.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is one of the best Sarah Cd's out there. Thougtful and insighful lyrics added to wonderful instrumentation make it unforgetable. The songs won't leave you alone.
B00005JM02|4.0|I want to say up front I saw this in the theatre with a 2 year old and  13 years old....the 2 year old slept through it. I knew buying the DVD exactly what I was getting. I did take the time to read the negative reviews, because I already knew the positive aspects of the film. I would like to address several ideas put forth.<br />1. This film is in the ocean, where there are vast areas of nothing but blue water. So would it not be realistic to see a couple fish swimming alone, in the vast ocean?<br />2. Violence is of course unacceptable in children's movies, that would be why we don't buy Bambi, Snow White, Peter Pan, Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmations, pinnochio, and I could name more. Violence has been part of Disney films, as long as they have been making films.<br />3. This is a children's film you are reviewing. To expect complicated plots with depth of character is a little silly. I know the movie has no real depth, but how many 5 year olds are looking for character development in their films?<br />4. Last but certainly not least, ALL Disney films without exception, the animals talk. ALL OF THEM! When striving for a theme that would appeal to children, Disney understood quite early that characters like Bambi were easy for children to relate to and like. Lets face it, Tom Hanks is a brillant actor, but my children didn't like Philidelphia or Apollo 13. However, knowing he was acting for children in the 2 ToyStory movies, they loved him as Woody (and Mr. Hanks was brillant, clearly the only choice for that role).<br />Think about the Disney Classics you already own, and really this is on par story wise with all of them with superior graphic.
B00006RCOB|5.0|I've seen this film at least seven times, and I enjoyed it just as much each time.<br />This is a very enjoyable cold war action/spy drama. Tense action carried out in Clint Eastwood style.<br />If you like Clint Eastwood. You'll like this film. Some have pointed out some continuity errors in the film, but these don't spoil the story. The characters are acted in such a way as to make you care about what happens to them.<br /> It's looely based on the books. The movie ends in a way I won't spoil. But I will say that after you see this movie you should search out the books, Firefox, Firefox Down (they are selling on Amazon; as used for a penny)
B00006J3WH|5.0|The astonishment at finding that Joss Whedon, who authored all these songs, can hardly play, diminishes when you remember that neither Irving Berlin nor Paul McCartney ever learned to read music.  And comparison with such giants is not exaggerated.  These songs are really in the great tradition and worthy of being mentioned with the greats (with one exception - which I'll get to); and, on their evidence, the talk of a Buffy musical which I heard is by no means a bad idea.<BR>Whedon's music is theatrical in the best meaning of the word. Great theatre musicians, from Mozart to Lloyd Weber, must produce music that is not only fine in itself but capable of developping the drama it describes; and Whedon's music does exactly that. When, in the ensemble WALK THROUGH THE FIRE, Emma Caulfield breaks in with &quot;She came from the grave much graver&quot; and James Marsters interjects the nonsensical &quot;First I'll kill her, then I'll save her&quot;, these items both add to the story, round out the characters, and are beautifully melodic in themselves.  Whedon, at any rate, did not just get a fancy and go for it head-first: when he started composing his songs, the first thing he did - according to the booklet in the CD - was to find out the ranges and vocal abilities of his cast, with the result that each of these songs fits very precisely the person it is written for: which is what great theatre musicians like Verdi did. This is music of which nobody need feel ashamed.<BR>Sarah Michelle Gellar sings rather like I imagine the great Katharine Hepburn must have when, in her seventh decade, she undertook to perform in the musical COCO: I mean that she sings like an actress.  Her voice is not trained to sing, and her tones lack fullness and grace: but she gives every word its value and emotional power, and the result is powerful and convincing on its own terms.  She is one of the greatest living actresses, and on the evidence of this performance I am astonished that her CV doesnot include much stage work, because her measured and calculated approach to voice production just screams &quot;THEATRE!&quot; to me.  When, like every American actor of note, she comes to London to tread the boards, she is sure to be a great success.<BR>The revelation of this record is Amber Benson. Why on God's green earth is this lady not a professional singer, and why is she not a great star, is more than I can imagine.  Her voice is not only ravishing, but exactly right for the role and emotions she has to produce: it races across the upper reaches of the soprano range to produce an effect of soaring magic shot through with joyful excitement.  The effect is deliberate, since elsewhere, in the duet with Anthony Stewart Head, she shows that she has lower registers as well - which were just not used here, because they did not suit the effect Whedon wanted.<BR>Emma Caulfield also has a lovely voice, though some of her tones do tend towards shrillness; and Anthony Stewart Head, who is apparantly capable of doing anything, sings with authority and almost excessive sweetness.  James Marsters is a bit of a disappointment: I like him as an actor, and I knew that he is a professional musician, but his range seems rather narrow and his tones dull.  Joss Whedon manages a decent song for him within an octave, though the Beatles, faced with a similar problem with Ringo, managed it rather better.  Nicky Brandon is amateurish as a singer, though the DVD cannot show that he is a surprisingly excellent dancer; and Hinton Battle sings his sensuously threatening line like the old pro he is.<BR>All told, the only serious disappointment is, unfortunately, the climactic song SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT: bathetic in its sentiments and singularly unresolved in its music, it leaves the spectator flat and suggests that Mr.Whedon really has no particular idea why living should be better than its opposite.  But the episode ends up staging a great recovery with the excellent, emotionally charged and ambiguous conclusion WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?, which also boasts another memorable tune.<BR>The rest of the album is filler, though pleasant enough.  Instrumental soundtracks are rarely strong enough to carry a CD by themselves, and the ones presented here are no exception; and given the way I feel about SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT, you will not be surprised to hear that a second version of it does not increase my pleasure one iota.  Nevertheless, this is a superb album in its own right, and one that any lover of musicals should own.
B00005JMFR|5.0|It has been my experience that unless you view the Matrix movies from a symbolic/spiritual path perspective, you will probably be dissapointed. If this movie was only about action and fight sequences, with no symbolic undertones, it would be a major dissapointment. However, there is no such lack in any of the Matrix movies. All people who have taken it upon themselves to discover Life and to experience truth for themselves, understand the significance of these movies. The trilogy of the Matrix is about the story of the human being as they progress along the path of consciousess evolution. <br />I have read many reviews that claim the action sequences were not done properly (too long, too short, etc.)and that the acting is continually dull and lifeless. On the surface level, this may or may not be true and it totally depends on personal preference/opinion, but the message behind all of it is profound. Like most of life, we will find that we must dig deeper for the truth. <br />I have stayed away from commenting on particulars about this movie because I don't want to be a spoiler. I can only encourage those who go to see it to discover the hidden messages about life and our own enlightment. And of course, enjoy the action...it doesn't get much better than this!
B000084T18|5.0|G-Unit &quot;Beg For Mercy&quot; will share the same release date as Jay-Z's LP &quot;The Black Album&quot;, after they discovered that the album has been leaked to the Internet and bootleggers so COP DOUZ ON 11/14!!!
B00008J4P5|4.0|Ok, I don't normally write reviews here but frankly there are too many posted on here that complain about this band and this album and are just plain wrong.  First of all, they are not brother and sister, they are a divorced couple.  Second, the second british single, \\"I just don't know what to do with myself\\" was not written by them, it is a Burt Bacharach cover.  And finally, stop mentioning the hype or the \\"saviours of rock\\" tag when you review.  The band did not have anything to do with that so just stick to the music.<br />Now, as for the music, it is very good.  I have been a fan of the stripes since early 2000, or pre-fell in love with a girl.  They are easily one of the best bands going right now, and this along with De Stijl are their two best albums.  This album is their return to the blues since Jack purposely avoided writing blues-heavy songs for white blood cells.  <br />The songwriting is fantastic on this album.  The lyrics are smart and the guitar riffs come fast and furious.  But two things have improved particularly: jacks famous garage-rock guitar sound and his production expertise.  One listen to Ball and a biscuit and an acute white stripes fan will notice a new sound: a fuzz pedal.  The use of this alone, diminishes any argument that it is sonically similar sounding which someone could say about white blood cells.  The production is also a marked improvement as songs like \\"Theres no home for you here\\" can attest to.  <br />I've also heard some arguements that the white stripes are just ripping off led zeppelin or some other blues artist of the '70s.  Well, if you had half a brain you would realize that all those british blues artists are ripping of Muddy Waters and John Lee hooker, who \\"ripped off\\" Son House and Robert Johnson, who \\"ripped off\\" Skip James and Leadbelly.  Please.  Each of these artists took a musical form, analogous to a sonnet, and used it to express themselves.  Each artist adds something to it, sometimes obviously, sometimessubtley.  The fact is, the white stripes do use the blues form and they use it well.<br />This is not the best record you will ever hear in your lifetime, as some TRL kids who just like the singles may say.  Anyone with a decent record collection will undoubtably find something that is better, from Revolver, to pet sounds, to blonde on blonde, and so on.  That said, it is a fantastic record, with some originality, great guitar playing, and smart, non cliched lyrics.  I bought it the day it came out and it hasn't gone more than 3 days without being listened to.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with a good taste in music and an appreciation for the blues.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|It has been two years since Britney has shown the world what she can actually do. With this new album, it basically sums up her current emotions that she is going through. She co-wrote 7 tracks off the album as well. With 'Me Against The Music' already out in high rotation, the song basically sets the mood for the rest of the album. This album can be described simply as 'trancy' There are very few slow ballads on the album. Britney also had to opporatunity to work with some of the best producers out there (P Diddy, R Kelly, Moby) One thing that sets 'In The Zone' apart from the others is the sexual presence during the album. You can tell all through the album. If you love Britney, or even hate her, this album is for all!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|It's really tough to follow up a great and highly praised debut album like Is This It, but The Strokes are more than up to the task with Room on Fire, their highly anticipated sophmore effort.  After several listens, I got over the initial impression that some people had given me that this album was just a wannabe of their debut, and began to realize how good it really is.  The songwriting is stepped up a notch on this one, along with the production, replay value, and song variaton.  There isn't really a bad track on the album.  I myself find the first single, 12:51, as my least favorite.  The second track, Reptilia, is a great song, and definetly the highlight of the album for me.  Other tracks I really like include The Way it is, The End has no End, Automatic Shop, and What Ever Happened?  <br />If you liked the strokes first album, I doubt you will be disappointed if you give Room on Fire the chance it deserves.  I did, and it hasn't left my cd player since!  Definetly high in the runnings for best rock album of 2003.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Like Dido's new cd, this one, I had to hear several times before loving it.  It is standard Sarah and I love it!  Fallen was a great track, same with World on Fire, Train Wreck and Answer.  OMG Answer IS THE ANSWER!  Def one of the bst songs she ever wrote.  <br />Now I remember why I love her so much, her simplicity and that voice!  I've been a long time fan and still love her music.  To me, this is a nice break from hearing so much NOISY stuff lately in today's music.  It may sound very similar to her old stuff, but since it's been so many years, this is a great break from the other music I've been subjected to.
B00008H2LB|5.0|First off let me say this. I am into a lot of music. I have major opinions on music. Linkin Park is a very talented band. They are talented for their Hybrid Theory album basing it off of confusion and wanting to be alone. They are a great band for making their first album staying on one topic. Where as their Re-animation album was ok, but then Meteora Blew it away. Meteora has to deal with a harder type of sound. They are more free about things. Well that's the way I see it.<br />Linkin Park is a very popular band and everyone likes them. Don't get me wrong, but Linkin Park is my favorite band. Still they have catchy tunes that are ear grabers. You know what I mean. If you are into Alternative rock, or want to hear something new, I suggest you check out Linkin Park. Their first album was the best so far, well I think, and yes I like Meteora a lot too... ^_^
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Unlike most people, I actually liked the movie.  The low rating is for the pathetic &quot;features&quot; on the DVD.  In breathtaking contrast to the vast amount of interesting added content on the original DVD, this one does not even contain a SINGLE COMMENTARY TRACK.  The few extras are utterly sucktacular puff-pieces.  They consist of endless gushing about how cool and exciting the movie and everyone involved in it are.  Oh yeah, and LOTS of thinly-veiled attempts to get viewers to buy all the ancillary merchandise.<br />The ONLY reason I bought this instead of renting it was that I assumed it would have lots of features which I would want to spend a long time perusing.  Stupid me.  Even if you DID sit through this crapulous pile of advertainment, it would only amount to an hour or two.<br />If you'll be watching the movie enough times to make it cost-effective to buy instead of rent, then by all means do.  But DON'T give the features a second thought.  They are one huge, whopping insult.
B0000VD04M|5.0|\\"Your movie?  I wish it was your movie.  I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever had into making this stink bomb; and if I ever see ya again, I'llllllll kill ya!!!\\"  Too much for words.  Favorite movie?  Not for everyone; though I must confess: this is my favorite movie!  Would love to see more like this.  Maybe in the future, Depp and cast will do a zany remake.  And I sure hope ...they don't yank this DVD again from US distributers before the public gets a chance to purchase.  When the release date arrives, I may just have to buy two copies.
B000000W5P|5.0|The Rolling Stones with Some Girls (1978) ended a decade that they had began with classic records like Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main Street (1972). There is little doubt in my mind that after Sticky Fingers, Exile, Let it Bleed (1969) and Beggars Banquet (1968), Some Girls is the Stones'best album. <BR>There are some many instant classics on this record: Miss You, Beast of Burden, Shattered. There is a great cover of Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me). There are songs of remarkable quality (Far Away Eyes, ...). But above all else there's Keith's Before They Make Me Run. Which is more than a song, it's a political statement, it's pure Keith.<BR>In the 1980s and in the 1990s only Tattoo You (1981) and Voodoo Lounge (1994) came close to being as good as Some Girls. Yet in this case close is just not close enough.
B000002B2T|5.0|Probably one of my all time favorite cds . . . EVER!!!  The chemistry between all of the band members is amazing, plus Layne Staley (RIP) does an INCREDIBLE job on vocals!  A must have!!!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Wow. This cd was just a random, &quot;oh, the cover art looks good, lets get it&quot; buy. I was very suprised. This is the kind of goodness that would come of a Hives/White Stripes/Vines/Strokes marriage. Good stuff. Great stuff. I need more already.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I was expecting the Revolutions at least better than the Reloaded, however, yes sure, in terms of those CG effected scenes for sure have big improvement, but I guess these scenes are \\"supposed\\" to be there anyway (in both budget and attractive level)so that it wouldn't give the audience a big supprise!<BR>Moreover, about the story, it can be said as very insane~~ Compare to the Reloaded, it's even more complicated the story rather than give answers to all the questions that has been generated.<BR>One more disappointment which is that the diagloue in the Revolutions is unexpectedly meaningless, and everything has to be said to explain every action that the character took.......<BR>If just pay for the view of those CG effects, it worth the price for the tic!!!!
B00005JMFR|5.0|I watched this movie last night and I must say that I was blown away. I admit that after the first two Matrix movies I had gained a lot of respect and faith in the Watchowski brothers and so I was almost certain that they would deliver on the third. And boy did they deliver! This final chapter was everything that I could have hoped for and it maintained everything that made the first two so great. I won't give anything away but I will say that I found the entire movie to be immensely satisfying. It managed to satisfactorily conclude the trilogy without betraying the thought-provoking aspect of the 3 movies by unrealistically tying up all the ends and explaining everything.  I much prefer it this way and I found the ending to be perfectly in line with the spirit of what the Matrix movies are about.  The way the creators developed the trilogy from beginning to end can only be described as masterful.  Matrix Revolutions, together with the first two chapters, represents one of the finest and most powerful epics of the modern age. In fact, I would even go so far as to say that it is one of the most important examples of what might be called \\"our modern mythology\\" (as are the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings epics), expressing our hopes, fears, and dreams, as well as our ideas about love, life, death, existence, free-will, imagination, determinism, what it means to be alive, faith, friendship, ultimate reality, causality, heroism, balance, freedom, slavery, peace, war, purpose. As we watch these movies we are inspired to think about some of the deepest questions confronting humankind which include all of the themes above as well as many more. That these movies successfully blend so many elements into a cohesive and entertaining whole is a true testament to the genius of their creators. <br />This is why I find it very confusing that there are so many people with negative opinions of these movies (especially the last two movies). I think this phenomenon is mainly due to twothings. The first and most easily observable fact is that some people sincerely are unable (or unwilling to put out the effort) to understand the plot, let-alone the philosophy.  Since they don't understand it they unsurprisingly don't enjoy it.  I know this is true because I work in a video rental store and people have directly told me that the reason they didn't like it was because they didn't understand it. As for this all I can say is \\"oh well, your loss\\".<br />The second and most contributing factor is merely an irrational cultural backlash against a movie that has been well received and is wildly popular. <BR>There are those people in society who will instinctively attack and criticize anything that becomes extremely popular in the culture. This is a very common phenomenon and you see it all the time. (For example, people who go out of their way to ruthlessly attack a successful pop-group). Of course people acting in this way will claim to the ends of the earth that they are expressing their \\"honest opinion\\", but it is so easy to see from their criticisms that they are motivated by something else. I believe their motivation, in essence, is merely a form of jealously and a way for them to feel superior to the world around them, which they feel they have no control over. So instead of just allowing themselves to enjoy a movie like The Matrix they spend all of their time looking for its faults. But the worst part is that most of the time it isn't an honest criticism of actual faults that the movie might have but rather a criticism of things that are objectively not true about the movie. For example, I always hear self-appointed know-it-alls saying that the Matrix movies are not philosophical at all, implying that all of us who are provoked to thought are motivated by nothing. This is absurd. For one thing, it is objectively demonstrable that the movies contain many of the philosophical themes that have been present throughout all of man's philosophy through theages. If you want me (and others) to take such an opinion seriously you would need to show that the movies don't contain those themes. But alas reviewers like that never even attempt to, it seems they feel they are somehow above having to justify their statements, statements which, by the way, are contrary to what so many others think.  One reviewer, who called fans of the Matrix \\"juvenile minds\\", wrote of the Matrix's \\"sophomoric cause/effect/fate/choice/vomit philosophy\\". Is he really claiming that the questions of cause and effect, fate, and choice are sophomoric? Oh how philosophers up through the centuries could have benefited if only they could have received this wisdom sooner, therefor not having to waste a mountain of thought and writing on these silly sophomoric questions! It is for absurdities like these, of which the extremely negative reviews are filled with, that force me to believe that most of those reviewers are either complete morons or are really motivated by something other than sincerity. I believe it is almost completely the latter but unfortunately I cannot respect such intellectual dishonesty. If someone were to correctly identify that the Matrix movies are philosophical (among many other things) but say that he doesn't like movies which make him think too much I would personally disagree with that value judgement but I could at least respect his opinion as something to take seriously. For example, if I hold up a book to a person and he expresses the idea that he doesn't like reading-- that would be the expression of a value judgement with which I would disagree but one which I could take seriously. If on the other hand I hold up a book to a person and instead of telling me his opinion of books (or of reading) he claims that I am not even holding a book-- that would be an opinion which I could not take seriously, especially if he is unwilling to prove or demonstrate why he believes that I am not really holding a book even though I believe thatI am. <br />Other claims about the movies having no plot or the actors not being any good at acting are similarly absurd and easily shown to be ridiculous. These two claims are harder to refute without going into a great deal of detail but as an actor and a student of the theater I will say a few things about them. The plot is amazingly well executed considering its complexity and the number of elements which are contained within it. Those that don't see how amazing the plot is are simply missing it.  If I had the time or the space here I would go into a deeper analysis of the plot, comparing it to established criteria in order to show its depth and structure.  More important to note though is the fact that a majority of people all around the world see a deep and exiting plot where the complainers see \\"no plot\\".  How can these two ideas be reconciled? Well the answer is...they can't. One view is based on nothing more than a bare assertion (a blank and worthless opinion) while the other one is  supported.  In fact several books have been written which explore the plot and symbolism of The Matrix. So these reviewers in effect are arrogantly claiming that millions of fans as well as the many people who have invested so much time and energy to studying and writing about the movies are all completely full of it, that all these people are just imagining a plot where really \\"there is no plot\\", imagining philosophy where there is \\"no philosophy\\", and enjoying the movie when there is \\"nothing enjoyable about the movie\\".  <br />Now as to the frequent claim that the actors in the movie can't act.  Let's take a close look at this claim to see if it makes any sense (and please don't spew out that relativistic stuff about it just being an \\"opinion\\").  If indeed these actors can't act then what are they getting paid for?  After all, movie making is a multi-million dollar enterprise and I doubt that all the people who put up the money for such an undertaking or the people who workto bring their creative vision to life are going to be so inept that they can't even tell whether or not someone can act.  You think it wouldn't occur to them to search out the actors who would be best for the various rolls (i.e. that can act out the specific rolls most effectively)?  Or are you claiming that you, who know nothing about film making, know more than whole teams of people whose unique skill is knowing about this stuff and bringing movies to life?  Some people will of course claim that it is just because the actors have a pretty face, but such a claim is absurd because there are millions of people with a pretty face who I am sure would be willing to work for a small fraction of the money that the Matrix actors earn.  <br />Go ahead and say that you didn't like the way the characters acted but please don't arrogantly arrogate to yourself the status of supreme judge on things you know nothing about.  It is a slap in the face to the creators of The Matrix movies who deserve our respect and admiration for pushing the boundaries and creating a powerful and timeless work of art as well as to all the people who sincerely enjoyed and were moved by the movies.  Besides, if I really hated something that much I sure as hell wouldn't go to the trouble to write a review on it.  But then again I don't believe that those who are writing those one star reviews are writing them because they hate the movie itself, they only hate it because it's great and because it has got so much attention and because so many people love it.  This is why almost all the reviews are either 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews, the one star reviews are representative of plain old irrational cultural backlash, comprised of a bunch of people who somehow feel better about themselves if they can put down something that is widely considered to be good.<br />So my sincere recommendation to any of you who haven't seen the movies is that you don't pay the critics a second of thought and that you watch and judge the movies for yourself .  All three of them are truly amazing experiences and even if you don't like them as much as I do I am sure that if you watch them with an open mind you will get a lot of enjoyment out of them (no matter what you are looking for in a movie).
B00005JMFR|1.0|Look....I like movies....a lot...I'm a movie buff....I've spent entirely too much money building my own home theater (of which I'm pretty proud)....so I can get the \\"full theater experience\\" in my own home.  Let me just say that this movie will never, EVER appear in my house!  I'd sooner watch all 6 hours of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" in full 6.1 surround sound (please don't tell my girlfriend I said that).  <br />I watch movies because they're entertaining....not to achieve a state of enlightenment.  Have there been movies that make me think?  Sure.  This movie made me think too...about gouging my eyes out with a spoon (if there indeed is a spoon)...just so I could eliminate any possibility of having to view it again!<br />My summary:<BR>Robots with machine guns - cool<BR>Tough chick flying the ship through tunnels - cool<BR>Death of main characters - VERY cool<BR>Everything else - see spoon comment above<br />The Oracle should've told Neo (and the brothers) at the end of the first film to quit while they were ahead.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|I've been a Coldplay for a long while now.  Having both &quot;Parachutes&quot; and &quot;A Rush Of Blood...&quot;, I eagerly bought this live set the day it came out.  The live concert (DVD) is a sight to behold!  Chris Martin and company have the crowd (Sydney, Australia) in their grasp as they perform majesticly on center stage.  Chris is engaging in particular as he enjoys himself on stage moving and bobbing at times and trying to get the crowd to sing along too!  I think the most moving part of the concert has to be during the performance of &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; when towards the end of the song, Chris asks the crowd, specifically those in the back to sing along!  In my humble opinion, Chris' playing on piano and the crowd's sing-along was probably the highlight of the concert.  Anyway, to wrap it up, the whole 90 minute concert is excellent.  Live performances of &quot;Politik&quot;, &quot;God Put A Smile...&quot;, the rousing &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot;, &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;In My Place&quot;, the awesome &quot;Moses&quot; (should be a single!)&quot;, and the closer &quot;Life Is For Living&quot; are the ones that stand out.  The only downside is that the CD only has 12 of the 17 songs from the DVD.  Still, this is a DVD/CD set worth buying!
B00005JMFR|5.0|There's no other movie except The MATRIX Trilogy.If the first Matrix was awesome,the second was incredible the third is Absolutely a legend... Awesome war scenes,incredible soundtrack and legendary final fight scene.These are some words to describe The Matrix Revolution.Before going to see it you must see The Matrix Reloaded because they're connected.But once you get out of the theatre you become crazy.The final is unexpected...I just can wait to see it again.Once the DVD will be on sale I'll buy it and dedicate a whole day to the Matrix Trilogy.To every one that hasn't see it: What are you waiting for?
B000002UAO|5.0|Which is why &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; landed at no 6 on vh1&quot;s all time great poll (Revolver was 1),and also the Rolling Stone record guide gave this 5 stars,also. Only a total nincompoop would not love this...5 stars easy!!!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|The Matrix Reloaded is the sequel to smash sci-fi hit: &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  The problem with this though? It's a sequel, meaning that it'll only bridge the first one to the third one, and all the really cool scenes in the first one aren't cool anymore.<br />The acting in this movie isn't bad.  Surprisingly enough it's pretty good.  The characters are still the ones we saw from the first Matrix movie, and introducing new ones.  But the new characters don't play any major role in the movie.  Niobi, for example, doesn't do much in the movie.  We don't get to see her fight or anything.  She plays a larger role in the third movie, thank goodness, but the fact that she's only a character to take space is an utter waste of film.<br />As many have said, the fight scenes are actually kind of boring.  They were fun but long.  Seeing Neo beat up 1000 Agent Smiths is nice but the scene began to grow long and boring.  I wanted the movie to move on at some point.  Plus, Neo has the ability to stop bullets and such, and that took the fun out of another fight scene that also lasted too long.  Not to mention that slow downs are used at times that I don't think they should've been (we watch the scene slow down while they're shooting at each other on the highway...why? The first one executed this PERECTLY but this one only wants to &quot;look&quot; cool).<br />Also, my number one gripe, WHERE WAS THE PLOT!  The first got me worked up on this plot and Reloaded ignores the plot for the first hour or so.  When the plot finally comes into play they just throw it at you and leave a lot of holes (that the sequel fills in thank goodness).  So as I said, it's only a bridge to the third movie.<br />On a final note, the movie got too much hype.  A lot of hype tends to make a movie worse!  Why? Because we expect so much more than what we see.  Everyone talked about how awesome the plot was, and it's absent from the majority of the movie.  Not only that but to understand it better you have to watch &quot;The Animatrix&quot; and play the game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;.  Again though, a lof of these holes are filled in during the third part.<br />Reloaded was actually a satisfactory movie, but I was a little upset at the fact that Neo doesn't have enough emotions and that Agent Smith is just there...the movie doesn't go into enough detail on just HOW he became able to multiply himself or just WHAT his intentions are.  Again, the third one answers.<br />Still worth it to go see at least once.  The first one was great but it just had a level of superiority that no other Matrix movie could ever top. Not even this one.to watch &quot;The Animatrix&quot; and play the game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;.

B000002UAU|5.0|The grammy winning one, of course. Sergeant pepper and the refrain are great,with Sir Paul in top form. With a little help  is a classic,Which Ringo still does to this day. Lucy in the sky is still talked about to this day,amid controversy.People still love When I'm 64,Being for the benefit is wonderful,and A day in the life is considered by many the greatest song ever,by any one,period.
0446677450|5.0|Rich dad is already in my opinion a classic read and stands on its own as one of the all-time best reads in this particular genre. In my humble opinion this is one success based book that we all need to read. If we want to take ROI into consideration, then this is a sound investment!
B0000DJZA0|2.0|The DVD is great in quality for picture and sound. The CD does not have near as good quality.  There are no suprises here and a live cd should not be made by Coldplay...why?  because the songs are the exact same as they are on the album.  All of their songs follow the same structure, same chord progression, same repetative beat.  Yellow is to Politik as The Scientist is to Amsterdam.  The worst song on the album would have to be In My Place, where he clearly doesn't want to sing the chorus because he probably is scared of going flat and allows the crowd to do it for him. The song is not as powerful as it is on the album.  Just buy a Rush of Blood to the Head and you'll be more satisfied.  A reviewer referenced Oasis copying the Beatles...well Coldplay copies U2.
6305052158|4.0|impressive directorial debut from brando (he took over the reigns from kubrick). this psychological western is a bit dated and maybe a little too lengthy for the average moviegoer. however with a cast like brando, karl malden, ben johnson and slim pickens, the sweeping views of mexico and monterrey and a well developed story One Eyed Jacks is a movie well worth viewing
B000089RVX|5.0|I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS! A master of classical music meets hard rock! When I first heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; I instantly knew I would just have to have this album. the Amazing Amy Lee and the amazingly talented guitarists and drummer have truly brought us a piece of heart, beautiful even on the hard rock. I love it and all the songs are amazing.
B00008EY9G|5.0|A kind of a cross between &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot;, &quot;Identity&quot; still manages to form a pretty decent identity of its own.<br />Beautifully photographed, the film exhibits a richness in style and substance, with some elegantly-designed camera movements.  One final scene in the picture (a daylight scene near an orange grove) really impressed me for its deep, rich color. Just looks great on this Widescreen (2.40:1) presentation of the movie.<br />There's a Full-Screen (1.33:1) version of the film included here as well.  But &quot;Widescreen&quot; is definitely the superior format for this (or any other) motion picture.<br />With an ample supply of twists and turns to keep us guessing, this film (although featuring its fair share of lifeless bodies along the way) rises well above the &quot;slasher&quot; film mentality, providing the viewer with a perfectly reasonable--and realistic--explanation to the events we're seeing on the screen.<br />John Cusack is rock-solid here as a former cop who gets more than he bargained for during a seemingly-routine trip to California.<br />The movie-makers have done a more-than-adequate job of character development for this film. Not an easy task, either, considering we're introduced to more than your average number of principal players (numbering in double digits).<br />In the tradition of a good, old-fashioned scary thriller, &quot;Identity&quot; rises to the occasion and delivers some genuinely eerie moments.<br />It's nice to know that Hollywood still CAN make 'em like this in the 21st Century.
B00005A3KS|5.0|This 1991 film stars Keanu Reeves as Johnny Utah, an FBI agent trying to solve a series of bank robberies in the Los Angeles area.  His partner has a theory that these robberies were committed by surfers. And so our hero goes undercover in the surfing world.<br />First, of course, he has to learn how to surf.  And there just happens to be an attractive female surfer, played by Lori Petty, to teach him.  Naturally a romance develops but what is surprising is the remarkably short time it takes him to learn to surf. There's conflict with the other surfers too, but as he was once a football hero, he plays football on the beach with them and wins the respect of Bodhi, played by Patrick Swayzee.  Bodhi's into the spiritual side of surfing.  And he's also into free fall sky diving, night surfing and the ultimate thrills riding the waves.  The two men learn to respect each other. It's too bad that Bodhi is also a bank robber. And that he just happens to be Lori Petty's ex-boyfriend.<br />What follows is an action packed ride including chases on foot and with cars. There's several false leads and a bit of violence.  The story follows a formula, which is to be expected, but yet it is done very well.  The best part of the film though is the surfing.  It was able to make me feel the thrill of it all while I was sitting comfortably in front of my TV. I'm sure they used a lot of stunt doubles and special effects.  But I didn't care.  I just let myself be swept into the excitement of it all.<br />Recommended -- especially for action film buffs.
B000002HH9|2.0|One or two good songs, especially the first one. The rest is unbearable. Before Bloodflowers came out, I really thought it was the end of The Cure.  <BR>Buy the singles (The 13th and Mint Car) instead. Not for the hit songs themselves but because they have really good B-sides...
0743243307|5.0|This is the story of a young Bangladeshi woman who is sent to London as a bride. It is the late 1980s and she has to adapt to the challenges of an arranged marriage. It is a restricted world, of course, as she rarely leaves their tiny apartment and everyone she meets is alo immigrant from Bangladesh. She does adjust though, and we follow her life for the next dozen years, including the tragic death of one of her three children. We also observe  growing Islamic militancy  and the influence of Western culture on traditional values.<br />It is only after we get to know this woman from the inside out that a new character is introduced, a young man full of Islamic fervor.  By now it's 2001 and the whole community is affected by the events of 9/11.<br />We also get to see the infrequent letters she receives from her sister, who is still in Bangladesh.  There's a constant contrast between the two sisters, the one in Bangladesh having run away for a &quot;love marriage&quot; with horrible results.  She is cast out and alone and has to survive a factory job, then by selling her body, and later as a servant.  Life in Bangladesh is harsh.<br />One of the best things about this book is how the author can really get inside these two womens' minds.  One has accepted her fate.  The other has fought against it.  Both of them have different challenges.  And each of them is a product of her culture as well as the world around her. All her descriptions ring true and made me look at things in a new way.<br />The author knows her subject well.  She was born in Bangladesh and came to London as a child.  She's now married and has two children.  The photo on the flyleaf shows her in Western clothes.  As I read the book, I kept turning to the photo and thinking about the unique world that she describes, and how different it is from mine.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Seabiscuit was an excellent movie! I had read the book a few weeks before hand, since I had just started getting back into horse racing, and loved it. In the movie, I thought the actors did a fantastic job and the directing was excellent. Sure, they made things short sometimes and they didn't include some things from the book, but atleast there was a movie, right?<br />Now, I know most people think the movie is too slow. Well, how is there supposed to be a story when you don't have an introduction? Yeah, you really didn't get to see Seabiscuit until about an hour into the film, but who cares? There wouldn't even be a movie or book about Seabiscuit if it wasn't for what happened to Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), and Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire). And, that's what I like so much about the movie. But, once the movie started getting into the racing scenes, that's when it really got great.<br />I thought the racing scenes were done well. It felt really cool to be sitting in the movie theater like that. It felt like I was actually at the racetrack (which I haven't done yet). And, the music, I thought, was great for not only the racing scenes, but for the rest of the movie. I'm a country/bluegrass music fan, so there's some pieces in the movie (such as Call Me Red) that I enjoyed a lot. I'm also a fan of orchestrated music, so basically all the songs appealed to me. Overall, though, I have to say my two favorites are Pumpkin (which the horse was gorgeous in the movie) and The Derby (which is played when Red loses the race by a nose). And, I know this isn't a CD review, but it did add to the movie.<br />So, this was my review. Seabiscuit rules!
0385486804|4.0|Krakauer does a great job of telling the story of Mr. McCandless and relating to similar, past events - including those of his own life. His main goal, it appears, is to tell the story in the context of man's longing for adventure and his desire to interact with nature. Krakauer's biggest challenge, however, is more along the lines of proving McCandless was not an absolute fool - entering Alaska arrogant and unprepared. Regardless, Krakauer is a great writer and this is a fine book. Another great example of non-fiction as literature.
B00005JMFR|3.0|True inspiration can be spoiled by forcing ideas too hard and too fast.  Inspiration can also be destroyed when its forced at the wrong time. Sometimes ideas need to be sat on, culled over, and perfected before they are foisted on the general public. True art takes time.<br />In the case of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, it has one really huge mark against it.  That is that it was shot back to back with RELOADED.  So while the brothers Wachowski were able to up the ante that they set with the original MATRIX RELOADED, REVOLUTIONS has nowhere left to go.  While this film is creative and visually stunning, it feels like a lot of the same thing.  George Lucas did one thing correctly with his STAR WARS films being spaced three years apart. He was able to create new and stunning visual effects with technology that he only dreamed of with the previous films.<br />In REVOULTIONS Neo (Keanu Reeves, The Replacements) and his Superfriends are back where we left them.  Fighting the endless war with the robots.  You see where we last left the human race the robots were drilling into the last human city, and the dark suited Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, Babe) was running amok inside and in this installment outside of the Matrix.  As the war to save the human race commences, its up to Neo to prove hes THE ONE.<br />REVOLUTIONS can be summed in one word: UNDERWHELMING.  There is nothing new, nothing exceptionally cool, or anything of consequence going on.  In fact except for the tail end of one really neat action sequence, (thats too difficult to explain without ruining some vital plot points) the film has no suprises.<br />In fact the first hour of the film renders the last hour of RELOADED utterly pointless, it merely ties up some loose ends and you begin to wonder why they were introduced in the first place.<br />It also squanders Lambert Wilsons funny and sadistic Merovigian, and Monica Belluccis Persphone.  They are in the film for mere moments.  I can only surmise that its because the Wachowskis thought it would be cool to visit them again.  This entire scene proves is how unnecessary they were in RELOADED and I liked them in that one. (As a side note this scene also includes a moment that earns this film its R-rating.  Yes this is a PG-13 film with a moment in which a male extra grabs and tweaks a female extras breast.  Why?  Im not quite sure I wanna to know.)<br /> As with the other two films REVOLUTIONS has a backbone of stunning special effects.  While they look really good, they lack the creative spark that made the first MATRIX groundbreaking and its sequel a joy to watch.  REVOLUTIONS spends it time tying up the story and forgetting the tradition of not only stunning but also magical special effects.  The race to Zion sequence is the only segment that half works, and even the final showdown just kind of ends.  It should be awesome and it elicits only half the awe of the amazing final battle in the first Matrix or the breathtaking final shots of the Highway chase in RELOADED.<br />I just wonder how much better this film could be had it been made on its own two or three years down the road.  What amazing visuals could have been created? What interesting philosophies could have been dreamed up?  What new and unusual characters could have been conjured?  Well probably never know, and I guess I can deal with that, but I do want to.<br />To be fair THE MATRIX REVOULTIONS is still leaps and bounds above typical action movies.  Its full of enough eye candy to keep and action junky busy for a while.  I still intend to see this film on the IMAX screen, an experience that greatly improved the last film as well.  As it stands I probably wouldnt recommend this film to a casual moviegoer, or a sci-fi enthusiast.

B00005YXZH|5.0|the one thing i can say that sums up the album best, and most accurate is: WOW. wow because it is the farthest cry possible from the days Jeff Tweedy played bass and wrote a minority of the songs for the alt. country outfit with a punk attitude Uncle Tupelo. wow also because this was simply the most stunning album of 2002, and one of the most stunning albums ever. i bought it off of a casual whim. i read the rolling stone magazine's review of the album and it sounded interesting at the time and i thought i might look into it. i had never heard of wilco before, they sounded pretty cool. at the record store a few weeks later i come across the title, and with nothing better to do with my money at the time, bought it. this turned out to be the best &quot;impulse buy&quot; of my whole life. at first i thought that album was pretty good. slowly but surely though, the more i listened to it, the more i realized: &quot;this is probably one of the better albums ive ever heard this year&quot;. the unique production is at first confusing and &quot;cluttered&quot; feeling, but then you realize after repeated listens, that it makes the album come alive. the beautiful details are like burried treasure at times such as the lovely chord progression of &quot;radio cures&quot; that is so subtle it sounds like at any second it might blow away. other times, the beauty of the music is layed out bare bones for all to see, such as the albums consummate moment(for me that is): the short guitar and piano break after the final verse in &quot;poor places&quot;. absolutely chill-inducing. the lyrics are also incredible in their own right, poetry for the let down soul. each line of each song further cements my opinion that jeff tweedy is the best songwriter today(the one artist i thought gave him a run for his money was elliott smith, may his soul rest in peace.) here is a sample lyric from &quot;im the man who loves you&quot;: &quot;all i see is black and white, and white and pink with blades of blue that lay between, the words i think on a page, i was meaning to send to you, i couldnt tell if it would bring my heart, the way i wanted, when i started, writing this letter to you&quot;...amazing stuff. the first time i ever truly realized just how good this album was, is when i sat down with the lyrics, and listened and read along with no interruptions, afterwards i told myself, &quot;this is one of the best albums ive heard...ever.&quot; i could not recommend an album more highly than i do this one. if you appreciate great music that defies being put into any genre other than &quot;great music&quot;, you will not regret buying this album. a timeless album that easily captured my pick for the best album of 2002. <br />*just a correction to the review &quot;nine inch wilco&quot;; its not the albums closer &quot;reservations&quot; that has the female voice reciting the title, it is the second to last track &quot;poor places&quot;.
B00005JMFO|4.0|That is the spirit in which I can approach a film like Richard Curtis's LOVE ACTUALLY.  It is so close to being my favorite romantic comedy I almost wished that my own stupid sense of right and wrong didn't mess it up for me.  This is a movie that's so good that it's flaws are doubly illuminated.<br />Love is everywhere or at least that's the premise that Hugh Grant's (About a Boy) opening narration claims.  Then the movie goes on to prove just that.  We watch as 10 or 15 delightful and charming people fall in love.  And in the end each of these people is also connected either directly or indirectly to the other characters in the movie and so in the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a small microcosm of British society.<br />The film has charming written all over it.  Hugh Grant again plays that charming and debonair lady-killer he's gotten so good at playing.  Colin Firth (Bridget Jones's Dairy) plays this charming writer who falls for his maid, who doesn't speak English.  Emma Thompson (Junior) plays a mother and wife trying to come to grips with a tragedy in her own mind.  Liam Neeson (Schindler's List) play a widower who's young son has fallen \\"desperately\\" in love.  And While all this is going on, Alan Rickman (Dogma) and Laura Linney falls people in their office and Keira Knightly (Bend It Like Beckham) marries the man of her dreams, only to discover a little secret about his best friend.  As you can see a lot is going on here.  I can best be described as if you took a hundred romantic comedies and jammed them together.  Kind of a silly and romantic version of Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS.<br />Thankfully most of the major characters are fun, charming, and bring their own little piece of life to the film.  There is scene after scene of inventive fun.  I also liked how the film was full of silly cameo's that didn't destroy the overall structure.  Sure I saw Billy Bob Thorton, but the film didn't try to jam him down my throat.  I found my self momentarily going there's Billy Bob, but he embodies his character (The US President, think George W. Bush with Clinton's Libido), he's not playing Billy Bob.<br />The most interesting story arc follows Grant and his secretary (Martine McCutcheon, TV's Eastenders).  It's pitch perfect.  Every scene of him and McCutcheon made me smile.  I wanted to the see the outcome. I truly wanted these two people to fall in love.  It's hard for me to want to think that about characters in a more vapid rom-com.<br />It's scenes and characters like Grant and McCutcheon that make the weaker moments of the film fail miserably.  Most notably the stupid segments involving the stand-in's on the porno movie set and the dumb scenes involving the annoying British boy who goes to Wisconsin.  I wanted to watch characters that were involving.  These two story arcs were built on cartoon premises.  They're both weaker, like two bad jokes in an utterly flawless comedy routine.  They were both to silly, and did not have enough development to warrant their inclusion in this film.<br />The film also suffers from an overload of characters.  With so many interesting people to follow, it was difficult to dwell on one set of characters.  In the end you wind up getting the Cliff's Notes view of all these people. This hurts the Laura Linney (Maze) story most notably, because Curtis's screenplay tries to introduce dramatic scenes that are barely touched upon.  This makes at least one heart-wrenching scene in a mental hospital feel a little out of place.  Like it was tacked on cause every comedy needs a dramatic moment.<br />I also hated that the screenplay glossed over much of the Rickman's characters humanity.  Leaving the final outcome of his story arc vague, cause god forbid we leave the movie hating one of the main characters.  If you're going to waste time creating tension only to keep us in the dark in the end don't waste my time.<br />In the end LOVE ACTUALLY is a wholly frustrating and equally a great film.  It's chock full of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching.<br />I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary. He plays an aging rock musician who's re-written one of his classic tunes into a Christmas song.  Sure he's sold out, but he sure won't promote it as if he did.  If Oscar has a funny bone, this performance is worth a supporting actor nomination.<br />Listen if you can shut out the flaws, LOVE ACTUALLY will leave you satisfied.  If you're like me, then you like the movie with maybe a few too many reservations.  LOVE ACUTALLY is the best romantic comedy I've seen in a long time, and one of the best (if frustrating) movies of the year.<br />****1/2 (out of 5)ll of funny characters, silly romance, tragic stories, and in the end it delivers a movie that is mostly worth watching.  <br />I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Bill Nighy's (Underworld) wonderfully silly Billy Mack, a character that is really funny if a tad bit unnecessary.

0156027321|5.0|Wonderful, insightful, and spectacular tale. Pi is an amazing character. Martel's descriptive use of language captures the imagination and takes the reader on quite an adventure. Refreshing change from run-of-the-mill fiction. Everyone should read this book. We can all learn a lot from Pi.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|As a part of Portishead, Beth Gibbons churned out smoky cabaret blues which made for invigorating showpieces of her incredible smokey voice. But this somewhat self-indulgent solo debut collaboration with Rustin Man (what's with that name?) is ultimately a little less than what I expected.<br />Gibbons cannot be doubted for having taken some clever risks -- this album makes a cross into jazz, soul, autumnal and even folk arpeggios. But Portishead had oodles of subwoofer-bass and spunky, modern sounds. \\"Out of Season\\" on the other hand is a bit too ballady. The somber piano and mournful cello do NOT in my book live up to what I had expected from Gibbons.<br />We're plunged into this moodiness from song 1. \\"Mysteries\\" opens the album crisply, folkish arpeggios plucking their way around Beth's gasps, while a cadre of gospel singers in the background oooooh the record into being. \\"Tom the Model\\" carries on that flavour, answering delicate folk verses with a nicely retro big-band soul chorus. \\"Show\\", for all its miserable pleading, is as forgettable a song as Gibbons has ever crooned. \\"Romance\\" is another slowish ballad, with french horns thrown in for good measure.<br />\\"Sand River\\" brings on Gibbons' sexy voice into full swing, this is the most Portishead-esque number on the album! This, for me, is where the album really begins. \\"Resolve\\" and \\"Drake\\" lend the album its Billy-Holiday-in-Karaoke jazz flavour.<br /><br />Overall, if it weren't for the amazing vocal talent of Gibbons and the splendid arrangements I'd probably have suggested you to skip this one. But her voice is what carries the album and keeps me from resenting this purchase.<br />4/5 material.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have been to several Shania concerts and the Chicago concert was by far THE best concert I have ever been to in my life!!  Shania was SO full of energy, constantly moving, interacting with the crowd...it was great!  And the audience!  Wow were we hyper or what?!  Everyone was extremely excited to see Shania's first concert in the U.S. since 1999!  The band was fabulous too!  This concert just had so much energy and anyone that passes up this DVD doesn't know what they're missing!!  And yes, there are extra songs that Shania performed at Chicago that were not shown on the TV special so you're in for a real treat!  I'm telling you, anyone would love this for a present and if there's no one to buy it for, then buy it for yourself because this is one awesome energy filled concert!  It will blow the roof off as Shania says back in her 1998 concert special. :)  Shania definitely rocked this country the night of that concert!! WOOHOOO!!!

0321200683|5.0|I highly recommend this book because it offers solutions for many of the problems in enterprise software integration.  I was able to participate in the on-line group reviewing the patterns.  The authors were humble in receiving feedback and persistent in their desire to identify useful patterns with meaningful examples.<br />I am using these patterns at my present company designing in-house middleware solutions.  The book is not just patterns, but a Pattern Language of Messaging for anyone needing to work in middleware.  This will be a great reference for years to come!
B000002UAU|2.0|I bought this album in 1980. I was 14, and, at the time, quite a big fan of Paul McCartney. I had been listening to &quot;Wings Greatest&quot;,&quot;Back to the Egg&quot; and &quot;McCartney II&quot; over and over and over. I especially liked the charming, spontanic feel of &quot;McCartney II&quot;. So of course, I knew I had to get a Beatles album. &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; seemed like an obvious choise. Boy oh boy was I disappointed. And rather confused. There had to be something wrong with my head, thinking that &quot;McCartneyII&quot; was a much better album than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.<br />23 years later, even if I no longer dig &quot;McCartney II&quot; the way I did way back then, and even if few people will share my opinion, I still prefer &quot;McCartney II&quot; over &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; any day.<br />I must say &quot;Sgt. Pepper first of all leaves me empty. Even if there are good (and even great) ideas on the album, I really dislike the hammering monotony the music is performed with. A lot of the songs seem to go on for too long, like there is a verse/refrain being repeted at least one time too many. There isn't enough variation in the performances, the songs don't &quot;breathe&quot;. Just listen to what Joe Cocker made out of &quot;With a little help from my friends&quot; and you will (hopefully) get the idea. Then you have the self-indulgent, hopelessly overambitious songs like &quot;Within You Without You&quot; and &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;.<br />Summa summarum: The most overrated Beatles album along with &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. Best song on the album: &quot;When I'm 64&quot; (which Paul wrote at a very young age).<br />1967's best album: &quot;Forever Changes&quot; by Love.<br />And for you clowns who say that The Beatles always made excellent, five stars material, even when you deep inside know that simply isnt't true: That has nothing to do with interest and taste for music. That's FETISHISM!

0385504209|5.0|Controversy? In spades! Dan Brown has created exactly what he, his editors, his publishers, and his agent crafted...controversy. Why? Because controversy sells. And no two subjects are the focus of controversy more than sex and religion. I applaude Mr. Brown for having the guts and keen insight into the simplistic psyche of the literary public. As to his book, THE DA VINCI CODE, I found it fun, fast-paced, and intriguing. But wait! Isn't that what one looks for in fiction?<br />The continuing controversy and scorn Mr. Brown receives is in my opinion somewhat laughable. Mr. Brown has struck the nerve of many with this book but at what cost? This book can be loosely classified as \\"historical fiction,\\" but the reader must decide where history stops and fiction starts. This intellectual conundrum is the core creator of the underlying controversy. Mr. Brown will suck you in with a known historical fact while weaving his fictional storyline around those very facts. So, by the time the reader is through a passage or chapter, he/she says, \\"Hmmmm.\\" To say this isn't ingenious is disingenuous.<br />To the book...<br />Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is in Paris attending a conference when he is awakened by a phone call from hotel management and taken to a murder scene. After dusting the sleep from his eyes, he finds the victim is the curator of The Louvre, Jacques Sauniere, a man Langdon was to have met earlier that evening. However, Sauniere never showed and now the mystery of his rude imposition is clear. The Parisian authorities ostensibly ask Langdon to assist them in their investigation due to the mysterious and arcane message left on Sauniere's body. Unbeknownst to Langdon however, the French Police consider him the prime murder suspect due to an undisclosed line in the archaic message.<br />Enter Sophie Neveu, an attractive, brainy cryptologist working for the French Police, and, conveniently, the granddaughter of Sauniere. She has seen pictures from the murder scene, including the \\"undisclosed line\\" kept from Langdon, and as such, believes Langdon to be innocent. Moreover, she believes the message grotesquely situated on her grandfather's body was left for her as a bizarre yet pointed \\"treasure hunt.\\" The treasure? The Holy Grail.<br />Langdon is a returning character from Brown's earlier novel, ANGELS AND DEMONS. THE DA VINCI CODE is an ostensible history lesson albeit dubious at best. The action however, is pure fiction and masterfully wound. His use of parallel storylines with chapter-ending cliffhangers keeps the book fast-paced and suspensful to the end. Just like a good novel should.<br />To say Da Vinci was a man ahead of his time is a supreme understatement. Perhaps a great deal of this furor is entrenched solidly in our ignorance of Da Vinci and his \\"sight\\" into the future. Remember, history has him pegged as the first to envision manned flight. This, in the 16th century, well before the Wrights put it together. So, to say Dan Brown found the right recipe for a blockbuster novel would also qualify as a supreme understatement. Brown's focus on Da Vinci's paintings and ostensibly interpretive messages within is ingenious. Let's face it, Da Vinci lived 1,500 years after the events in question. One MUST question HOW Da Vinci would KNOW the actual facts of these events. This is the overriding \\"pinch of realism\\" that will continue to make the reader wonder yet this same \\"pinch\\" continues to make the reader thirst for more.<br />I read a review wherein the author indicated the following: \\"There is a paragraph or two in 'The Da Vinci Code' conveying the true meaning of history and man's involvement with it. Those who dominate & win can write history as they see fit. Those who lose will cease to exist in history.\\" How poignant. If this theory were applied to Da Vinci's paintings and the purported sybolism/meaning, one might be able to brush aside the zealous rhetoric and enjoy this book. Again, how does Da Vinci KNOW these facts? Everyone has their own beliefs and will reach their own conclusions. Mr. Brown can be criticized for his research and promulgations relative to Christian history and the Catholic Church but the question that one must ask (if taking Brown's storyline to heart) is: Do you believe the history you know as an undeniable truth or do you question it? Is history as black and white as we learned it in school or is there room for interpretation, shades of gray if you will? You be the judge.se facts?

0140177396|5.0|In College we saw the movie as part of American Literature class, I bought the book after. This is a short story that is good from the first to the last page, the fraternity beetween two men, traveling together looking for work, one of them is very big, but not very smart, so he is constantly getting in trouble, the other one, George, looks out for him. They have dreams, but times are hard, until they meet an old man that is willing to invest so the three of them buy a ranch. I dont want to go into the ending, but I can say it is sad and beautifull at the same time, I really recomend this book, for all ages. I have read some comments about people complaining about foul language, I dont agree, it is much worse on most movies today.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|This review is a revision after dozens of listens.<br />I'll say that I'm happy to own this album, but it hasn't grown on me as I thought it would.  I rarely bring it out to listen to.  When I do, however, it is like having an old familiar friend over--such is Sarah's warm voice.  <br />The album has her patented darkly romantic tone that will be the accompaniment to many intimate moments--small candlelit dinner parties, make out sessions.  However, as for straight listening, I will say it is a bit of a disappointment because none of the songs are completely distinctive.  I'm still having trouble remembering which songs are which, and what message/mood is from each one.  After reading most of the reviews, take note that there is a good mix of opinion--and this is reflected accurately in an album that is decent, but not great.<br />I've moved this from 4 stars to 3.
0743216458|5.0|My history teacher made this book a required reading for our class and I thought this would be a slow, informative, history-lesson type book. But since this book is based on the true-life accounts of real soldiers who went through WWII, the accounts are so vivid and descriptive that you can't help but be drawn into the story and feel for the characters.  I was happy for the soldiers who got their &quot;million-dollar-wounds&quot; and escaped the rest of the war and saddened by those who never saw the end of the war.  This really is a great book, I wish all of my required readings for school were as great as this one.
B00004WGY9|5.0|I was too young to catch the debut of Dexys, but it's my understanding the Brit press hated them, for their seriousness and anti-punk stance. <br />Well, here's a Gen-Xer who loves every era of Pop/Rock (including Punk) up 'til Grunge/Alt, which I found uninspiring and alienating. Thus, I admire --adore!-- the original Dexys mottoes, &quot;Projected Passion&quot; and &quot;Intense Emotions&quot;.  These are things we've nearly lost in the last decade, and these are things, *I*, for one, badly crave.<br />Ironically enough, some of these tunes are just as snappy and colorful as the best of the original Punk/New Wave movement. Others, notably a couple of slow, 12/8-time ballads, build on a quiet intensity, up 'til the breaking point. The discipline in these arrangements cannot be overstated.<br />The up-front, (in-your-face?) mix of horns, well, I'm stunned at how satisfying it is.  Never was a big horns guy, but again, it's the sheer ballsiness of it that appeals.  Corny and rebellious at the same time -- Genius, I say!  Genius!!<br />Which leads me to &quot;Geno&quot; -- Incomprehensible to imagine this tune reaching #1 on the charts today, with it's cheesy, almost Sousa-like horn riff . . . but I expect you'll find yourself humming it with pleasure, eventually. (Musical note:  Most compelling is how they seem to resist an overwhelming compulsion to fall into swing/triplet time. The conflict, the tension, is intense!)<br />Of special note:  &quot;Seven Days Too Long&quot;, a cover (of who?) is a fantastic bash, with the adrenaline of --dare I say it?-- the early Beatles -- only more loaded with tough, macho romanticism. (You never heard a major-seventh harmony sound so, well, brutal!)<br />If you're coming directly from &quot;Come On, Eileen&quot;, well, you're in for a shock.  This was a vastly different band.  But the passion of Kevin Rowland, coupled with the inspired strength of Kevin Archer, and a &quot;gang&quot; of dedicated players, yields *fantastic* results that you, too, may fall in love with.<br />I, for one, am ready for more/new/another Dexys, ANYTIME!
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|I have to admit that I didn't listen to the reviews saying this cd was garbage, because I always like to know for myself, and being what a great CD Mer De Noms was I thought Thirteenth Step would be so as well, that was my first mistake, I picked up the CD earlier today and it would be hard to be unhappier with it than I am, the only reason why it did not receive 1 star is because 3 songs (Weak and Powerless, The Outsider, and Pet) are savagable, not great songs but the best this cd has to offer, as a musician myself, I expected a lot more from this cd, and from the many many songs with little or know lyrics, such as Crimes (I don't know Maynard could count to 10 I am impressed) and Lullaby are pathetic as instrumentals if you can even call them taht, and the lyrics to &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; are mind numbling idiotic.  And the first song &quot;The Package&quot; is very slow and dull and by the end of the cd's 7+ minute song I am already in a catatonic state, you figure PC would have taken lessons from either Tool or Dream Theater who both write songs of that length very often, and are GOOD!!  I know I will probably get slammed by the &quot;arsty&quot; people who say I'm just taking it for face value, but as a fan of Tool and of PC's first Album I have to say I am utterly disappointed by Thirteenth Step and would not recommend anyone to buy it.
0380789035|5.0|I've read many reviews complaining about the pace and the one dimensional characters of American Gods and I'd have to disagree.  I read this book last year and, frankly, it's one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The pace is a little slow, sure, but really think about it, this book gets really involved, and if it didn't go a little slow, after you'd finished the book, you'd be sitting there thinking, \\"Ummm... what?\\"<br />  For, me this wasn't one of those books that you can eat up in a day or two and have the same regard for it. I read it over the span of two and a half weeks; each time I picked it up, I looked forward to a nice, relaxing/ not really that brain relaxing/ more like \\"Wow, that was awesome\\" at times, reading but I digress.  This is the book that first introduced me to Gaiman, and after the read, I was hooked.<br />  To read this book, you have to understand that it's not just a thriller; it's also about the growth of the main character, Shadow.  At the start of the story, he's very one dimensional (on purpose) and through out the story, he grows.  Wednesday, another main character, completely surprised me in the end.  This is not a book to just skim, each and every little side story is important in its own way.  It's called imagery.  Character background.  Each of the side stories gives you a better understanding of the characters or the plot.<br />  I think the most fantastic thing about this book, is how every thing fits together at the end.  It's very rare that one can find a writer who has the skills to straight forwardly start the story, then branch it into twenty different directions, bring it back in, branch it out again, and then tie it all up in a neat little package at the end.  Neil Gaiman is either a total writing genius, or a messed up wacko with issues who enjoys entrancing and fascinating people while at the same time, disturbing and grossing them out.<br />  This is a great book, a classic (in its own demented way), and if a high school sophomore can understand and love this book --along with at least twenty other class mates--, then any one with an open (and maybe a little twisted) mind can also enjoy it.  Seriously. It makes you think (oh no, thinking...)ented way), and if a high school sophomore can understand and love this book --along with at least twenty other class mates--, then any one with an open (and maybe a little twisted) mind can also enjoy it.  Seriously. It makes you think (oh no, thinking...)
B00005JM02|5.0|I just picked up this movie on DVD the other day, and i had yet to even see it. I was sure it would be that good and it was. It is visually stunning and it offers something to the entire family. One thing that irks me though, one reviewer on here by the name of MusicalGenius, who complains that \\" ...fish dont talk, ive been underwater and i know..\\" and \\"Jacques Cousteau would roll over in his grave if he saw this.....bla bla bla fish would have bubbles coming out if they talked.\\" It is sad that a person could lose their complete sense of imagination and forget the purpose of animated movies....TO ENTERTAIN!!! Anybody who loves animation, watch this great movie!
B00005JM02|5.0|Very educational movie! and an excellent movie.
B00004SWBS|5.0|This is the best type o negative cd i have ever listened to in my life! It is better than the first 2 damned cds. Man were the horrible. Steele's maturity has grown and so has the music of Type O Negative.<BR>GET THIS CD!!!!!!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah Mclachlan has proven over the years, that a well written song, and a beautiful voice, wil keep us coming back for more. This cd proves that. With it's warm ballads, and clever phrasing,proves she is in a class alone. Not wanting to change from a proven recipe, assures us of a great experience each cd. (Whats up with Jewel!!) I highly recomend this cd, for all<BR>Sarah Mclachlan fans!
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|This album is different because they tried to stay the same.The freshness and charm of the first ep and LP is now gone.Replaced by slower tempos and cheesy keyboard sounds. Where is the great bassline of Is This It? Where did the guitar interplay and nervous tension go? Maybe they sacked Nigel Godrich because he wanted them to move forward instead of fallng backwards.At least they didn't make Drew Barrymore an exe(cute)tive producer.Not bad but hardly essential.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Do you like early Agent Steel?  do you like the first stuff from the Bay Area bands?  The production of that albums are the worst, but I love that albums because of their music.  Maybe the last Iron Maiden album is not the best production you can find.  Maybe they miss Martin Birch, but the music is still great.  All songs are very well executed, the guitars, the bass and the drums sounds like their livin' their best days of their lifes.  Bruce's performance on stage is really amazing, and the quality of composition are the best.  10/10 for this album.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I'm like totally stoked to see Carrie-Anne Moss again, dude! I'm her #1 fan, man.  I like her more than life itself, dude.  She's totally buff and smooth and fights like a real woman! Go see this just for her, man.  I gotta go see it again, dude!
0385504209|4.0|The research is astoundingly thorough.  You'll learn things about Catholicism, Paganism, the Bible and more that you've probably never heard.<br />The &quot;shock&quot; here is that the story of Christ is not exactly as it was laid out in the bible.  To some of us, that's not exactly a shock, but those more orthodox who interpret the Bible literally--this book must seem like the biggest heresy of all.<br />But the history is dead-on, and you're going to be surprised at how what you've been told for so long is not factually correct.  Even more cynical is why it came to be that way (although predictable).<br />Definitely worth reading.  A quick read, too.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Great to watch in a dark room on halloween. Very scary.
B00005JM02|3.0|This movie was very scary for young children. I have enjoyed other Disney/Pixar movies, so I made the mistake of buying this one before I watched it.  I then saw the movie with children ages 2,4,5,9, and 12.  Of all of the children, only the 4 year old and 12 year old liked it.  The 5 year old cried for much of the film, and the two year old kept saying, \\"Scary.\\" <br />The animation is fabulous, and there is some cute humor in the movie.  I was surprised at how much violence there was in the movie.  All Disney movies seem to have some sort of violence, but most also include cute scenes with singing or some kind of happy events.  This movie was more of a child \\"thriller.\\"  I don't believe it is suitable for children under six, unless the child is not particularly sensitive.
B000007WNN|5.0|If you like the hard rockin' era of the Cult, this is the best album they did. Nothing else to be said.
B000002HMH|4.0|This is the album that marked the return of Metallica, complete with the changes such as the short hair and more mature sound.\\"Until It Sleeps\\" was the first single and a video that was in constant rotation on MTV for a long time. This was my first experience with Metallica back in 1996, other than hearing some of the black album. I remember listening to this album all year over and over and never getting tired of it. There are so many great songs on here like \\"Ain't My B***h\\", \\"2 x 4\\", \\"Mama Said\\", and as I mentioned before, \\"Until It Sleeps\\". Metallica always represents and creates real rock music and this is just one of their many masterpieces.
6302158249|1.0|I was abhorred by this concert. It didn't sound like the Dire Straits songs on their record at all. None of the leads were anywhere close to the originals, and the vocals were not very good. Sucked overall.
B000066NW0|4.0|I'm tired of everybody writing reviews that are not the least bit helpful to anybody deciding to buy this cd.  All it is is &quot;I love Avril Lavinge!&quot; or &quot;I hate her, she is such a poser, you don't know what reall punk is!&quot; becuase that isn't helpful at all.  If you are a pop fan this cd would be a good buy for you.  She doesn't write her own songs and she can't really play the guitar but just because of that, it doesn't mean you shouldn't buy her cd and like her music!  The cd has some really good songs on it.  It ranges from catchy high energy songs to slow ballads that you and friends will be singing along to in no time.  And overall, it's a pretty great debut cd.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Why would anyone want to own this show on DVD is beyond me. This was the worst show of all time until The O.C. came on the air. Maybe this show would have been watchable if the acting and special effects weren't so unbelieveably bad. Don't buy this.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|I wondered if it was possible to sound so polished live...? Well, having seen Coldplay live twice it's not often I am blown away by a bands energy, meloday and vocals (we love you Chris).  I was delighted to see how well the DVD brings this all out.  With amazing editing techniques you feel that the camera is flowing with the bands tempo.  The close up camera angles show the human side to the band and the clever use of color and B&amp;W keeps it fresh.  For anyone who has heard of Coldplay or never been fortunate enough to see them live, this is as good as it gets to being at the concert!  And believe me they are bloody good!
B00005JLYW|4.0|Although, this sequel is more entertaining, I guess, than the first one, I find the movie a bit too loud (or am I just too old for this new angels?). But it is a pleasure to see the ever gorgeous Jaclyn Smith as Kelley Garrett. But what's missing in this film is Kelley doing some action! Kelley Garrett is the most adept in martial arts and a sharp shooter among the angels.<BR>Sadly, she didn't do much in the movie.<br />A lot of her fans are so annoyed and dismayed not seeing her in action at all. The producers and the director didnt realized how important for the film to explore this aspect. I mean, we are talking Charlie's most important Angel in this film. <br />Anyway, it's great to see the angels again and hope to more next time....
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is a great book with an ending that you would never expect.  The two main characters, George and Lennie, are traveling to find work on a ranch in California after a misunderstanding in their hometown.  George is a small built man who looks after his best friend Lennie, a large man with a mental handicap. Lennie looks up to George and will do whatever he says and does.   <BR> <BR>When they arrived to the farm George advised Lennie not to talk, fearing they would get rejected because of Lennies' handicap.  After receiving the job, they met all the workers and the bosses' son, Curley, a jealous, immature man who has recently married a flirtatious woman.  Lennie, being an easy target for confrontation, is the one Curley kept going after whenever he had a problem with his wife. <br />Steinberg did a wonderful job of keeping the readers interest.  While reading the book, you think you know how it will end, but when the ending comes, it is a major surprise.  To find out the ending, read the short, yet touching book, Of Mice and Men.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I THINK SHE IS THE GREATEST SHE SAOUD INCREDIBLE, I HAVE NEVER LISTEN TO SOMEHTING LIKE HER I THINK SHE IS JUST AMAZING <br />BUY THE CD
B00005JLEU|1.0|Ummm, whatever you want to say, this is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen!  The plot was confusing throughout the film, the characters were stupid, and the movie had no point!  The only element that redeemed this picture in my eyes was the boy who helped the idiotic girl try to rescue her idiotic parents so they could go back to their idiotic world!  Don't waste your time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have nothing new to add, just hoping to return it to a 5 star rating so as not to confuse the customers.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I am guessing that most viewers consider the Matrix trilogy to be a highly symbolic, religiously-themed set of movies.  They are correct, but not for the surface reasons that most will think -- instead, the films are the most anti-religious movies ever made.    Consider this:  Who has ultimate \\"control\\" of the universe? God, of course.  Who is supposed to be his foil? Lucifer, of course, but only by his choice.    But the Matrix says quite bluntly that God (the architect) and Lucifer (the oracle) not only are not enemies, they work in tandem to keep the universe (matrix) running as smoothly as possible.    Indeed, they have \\"rebooted\\" the universe multiple times...remember, Zion has fallen five previous times.  It is as if the \\"big two\\" have an on-going bet regarding the outcome.    Neo (Christ) is simply the unwitting tool of these two central figures.  The oracle \\"plays a dangerous game\\" in that she takes a mighty risk -- a risk that Agent Smith (the anti-christ) might destroy the matrix (the universe) if left unchecked.  She willfully generates a christ-figure (Neo), betting that he will overcome the threat through sacrifice, love and \\"peace\\" ... but not before extracting a concession from the architect -- that some (but certainly not all or most) of the lesser programs/people can actually gain their freedom if her christ-tool prevails.  You can argue that a by-product of her duel with the architect was freedom for a few (and continued misery for millions).    The final scene shows the new, squeaky clean Matrix -- a rebooted Matrix.  But for whom?  Who stays? Who goes?    Summary: The story as told is compelling and depressing, but a more shocking \\"Revolution\\" would have been for the oppressed to have turned against the oracle and the architect...and to have smashed their wicked game.  Man's freedom was not God's design -- it was a concession extracted by force.  The battle is not over.      ****  Appendix to original review    Many of the 1-star reviewers seem to think that Neo, Morpheus, Trinity...et al...are real people who battle machines.  They are not.  They are programs.  Everything is a program.    The Matrix takes place entirely in ... the matrix.  One hint is when Neo can uses his powers outside what the viewer thinks is the matrix.  No, he is not channeling the Source -- it is a hint to the viewer that it is ALL matrix -- multi-layered.    Another hint is when Smith can send himself via the \\"wet-ware\\" of Agent Bane.  Again, this would be impossible in a physcial universe -- it is a hint that everything is a program and that the real world is a layer of matrix.    Didn't the Oracle tell you that in Reloaded -- that everything has a program to control it?  And that programs that are not needed get deleted?    Neo is a program.  He was written to become the One and deliver the reboot of the prime program.  He has very little choice about that.    The Merovingian was clear -- choice is an illusion.  Neo is all cause and efect, not choice. Ah, but the controllers of the matrix (the Architect and the Oracle) are not all-knowing.  They are not omniscient.  There can still be UNINTENDED consequences.  Not all lipstick ends up on your face :)    The machines (in Machine City)...ironically...are also captives in the matrix.  You think the ruling elites would not be able to quickly find a way to enslave the MACHINE masses, do you?  The Architect told you that the matrix is older than anyone realizes.  The matrix controls the machines -- the fake story is that they won the war.  Only the machines don't realize they are being controlled.    Oh, some do.  The Indian couple wanted their daughter (program) to escape.  Maybe they are enlightened enough to realize what's going on.  Or maybe they just don't want their child program to be deleted.    The matrix is (literally) the universe.  And it is older than anyone imagines.  And the programs that created it (Architect/Oracle) are the ones who control everyone else -- and everyone else is just a program.    That's it.  That's why the movie ends the way it does. Neo executes his programming.  He returns to the Source (aka Machine City).  He reboots their mainframe, destroying the Smith anomaly.    The matrix reboots.  The machine programs and human programs start a new life.  But there are no \\"real humans\\" in this world...only human programs.  And a few machine programs -- such as the last exile -- will be granted status equivalent to the Architect and the Oracle.  But most will not -- they will stay under control.    But not absolute control -- some -- a few -- seem to be able to fight back.    At least the Merovingian (Devil) was strong enough to carve out a little world free from the Architect/Oracle.  I respect that.    But everyone else remains under their thumb.  Just programs.  No humans. No physcial world - at least not like we know.  Just matrix all around you.  No, you are not a battery in a machine power plant.  But you are not human either.  Roll credits and enter that shiny new matrix.    ###
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This IS musical genius.  Those rating this album with less than five stars are purely wallowing in the shallows.  If you possess any musical appreciation (especially if you play an instrument), you have no option but to highly rate this amazing piece of work.  This may be a bold statement, but prefer it to Mer de Norms (it took a few weeks of listening to come to this conclusion).   Yes, the more I listen to it, the more I crave it.  Mine, MINE, MINE!!...
B000002J1L|5.0|I recently rediscovered this one and, after 30-plus years, it sounds even better than I remember it.  As a random observation, what Genesis always seemed to have over other progressive rock bands from that era was a wicked sense of humor--as witnessed especially in tracks like &quot;Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; and &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot;.  The wicked side of their humor especially comes through in &quot;Harold&quot; where the humorous scene turns horrorshow at the drop of one or two beats.  The flip side of this is witnessed in a tune like &quot;The Musical Box&quot; where the weird events of the performance actually have their impetus in a rather funny short story that was originally included in the album's liner notes.  &quot;The Musical Box&quot; is also a masterpiece of complexity, moving through many musical stylings while building in intensity.  &quot;Seven Stones&quot; is a forgotten gem of beautiful, baroque interplay between the vocals and Tony Banks' classic Hammond B3 playing.  Great composing, great musicianship, and great lyrics overall--even the short pieces &quot;Harlequin&quot; and &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; are interesting in their instrumentation and treatment.  It's a shame nobody makes music like this anymore.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I really enjoyed watching season one.  The show is extremely well written!  Excellent characters and amazing plots!  I can't wait to see how the story develops for season two.
B000002J1S|5.0|It's hard to believe these days that--once upon a time--rock musicians were capable of producing recordings of such creative intensity and scope.  Like all artistic works of great imagination, this one continues to surprise and delight.
B00005JMFR|3.0|I was shocked that \\"Revolutions\\" turned out to be a bad movie.  I saw the previews, and they looked so cool that I thought there was no way this movie could possibly stink.  Well, they surprised me.  <br />First of all, I was one of the few people who really liked \\"Reloaded\\".  That movie was bashed, but I honestly thought that the Wachowski Brothers had done about as good of a job as we could reasonably expect them to do with the movie; after all, \\"they're only human\\".  It's not fair to judge them on the scale of the first Matrix.  <br />That said, \\"Revolutions\\" was almost a complete diaster and disappointment.  The film was utterly dismal and I felt like there was very little effort put into making the film exciting or satisfying.  Most of the film involved Niobe trying to get through a tunnel, and a bunch of mechs shooting at an endless stream of sentiniles.  Some of the battle scenes were mildly amusing, but most of it felt very B-movie standard scifi shoot 'em up.  It felt like the Wachowski Brothers spent all their money on that Freeway scene in \\"Reloaded\\".  <br />Despite the title of the film, almost none of the movie takes place \\"inside\\" the Matrix, and Neo is only marginally featured towards the end, almost like something forced and obligatory.  Trinity, Morpheus, and company just didn't do much of anything.  Honestly I didn't even know how they were able to fill up 2 hours so quickly with absolutely nothing.  <br />\\"Reloaded\\" set up a lot of possible cool ideas, most of which were totally wasted in \\"Revolutions\\".  The entire \\"Smith-is-Lucifer/a virus\\" idea, which was supposed to be the centrepiece of the third film, was surprisingly underused.  Very few lose ends were tied up, and the general feeling of the film can be summed up in one word:  unsatisfying.<br />After the movie, my first reaction was \\"WTF was this?!\\"  My second reaction was \\"OMG, this movie sucked!\\"  As a Matrix fan I am duly disappointed with this film.  Yes, everything that has a beginninghas an end, and it saddens me that this is how it ends.  <br />I give the movie 3 stars because it was not so terrible that I couldn't watch it, and like I said, some of the battle scenes were mildly amusing.  I would still say that if you're a Matrix fan, you should see it.  However, you shouldn't get your hopes up.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This is garbage, along with everything else released from Britney Spears. Don't waste your money on this. She can't sing at all and every one of her songs are so stupid! If I had to listen to her CD, I think It'd probably kill me by just one note from her awful little voice! this should not be classified as music. &quot;Rubbish&quot; would classify this garbage far more better.<BR>Don't buy this unless you're into 'rubbish'.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|The 2003 Italian Job is every bit as good as the original, combining great action, a good cast and some really witty lines.  That said this is not a remake, the story is totally different and the italian connection is shakey, more a distant excuse to use the same name.<br />The similarity is in the genre, the style of humor which is the spirit of the movie and the real stars of the film - thirty four Mini Coopers which are glorious.<br />The action scenes which are excellent, are made even better somehow by the fact the cast performed the vast majority of the stunts themselves.  The scenes featuring the Mini Coopers (the modern version of the cars used in the original movie)and the armoured car were incredible.  As an aside there were also a couple of scenes featuring an original mini cooper as used in the original movie, the contrast in the modern and classic versions is quite striking.<br />The cast are all very good, my particular favorites being Seth Green for being brilliantly funny, Jason Statham for pure cool and Edward Norton the villan for being the best actor by far.  Oh and don't forget Charlize Theron for being many things and all of them great.<br />Overall this is a fun exciting action movie with a lot of  laughs thrown in, overall for most people including me that is a pretty attractive package.<br />I would also recommend watching the original 1969 version, it still stands up as a movie well worth watching.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Only one word to describe this CD from britney...<BR>TRASH!!!<BR>Don't waste your money on this please! look at all the other bad reviews this album received, and you'll see what I mean and that it's not just my opinion or that I'm trying to hate. I'm only trying to advise people who like 'real music' to save their money and not waste it on such utter garbage like this.
B00008H2LB|5.0|When you've got a winning formula, stick to it. The boys of Linkin Park have obviously learned this fact. Their latest release, Meteora, provides the same hard hitting rap/rock songs that fans have been eating up, myself included.<br />I won't try and say that Linkin Park has come out with a fresh new style. They don't need to change when it's obvious that no one is out to copy them. <br />This CD is fast, furious, and a little too short for my liking. The hard guitar riffs are overtoned by Chester's voice spitting out poetry like it's nobody's business. The turntables and Mike's raps add another element to it that oddly enough tie everything together. When should you listen to it? When you're depressed, lazy, or just feel like rebeling. Overall it's yet another spot-on album from Linkin Park guaranteed to make you head bang.
B000065U1N|4.0|forget about nthe fact its about history sit down relax and get ready for one of the most violent films around. the movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes long. the first 30 minutes is talking and preparing and stuff. then at exatly when  30 minutes is over they will go to the battlefield and it will be violence for 2 hours straight. this movie is cool for tyhe intense action in the movie. lots of explosions and tons of guys dieng. also they use cool weapons and use tactical training so its not just a shoot everything that moves sort of movie. also the gore when they get shot is like WOW. they get blown up in half and even get shot so badly that when they try to save them they do some bloody stuff. if u like action movies with some gore this is the one to c. only bad thing is that the action is so much it might make ur head spin or it could get a bit repetittive and u could get bored. all in all u should check this one out.
B00000IOSU|5.0|At my house, this CD technically belongs to my mom.  However, I have been holding it hostage in my room for months.  Just one listen to it and I was addicted.  Every single song on this live album is done so brilliantly.  Sarah McLachlan's voice is so lovely and it meshes so well with the amazing songs.  Buy this CD!  You will not be disappointed!<br />Best songs: Building a Mystery, Hold On, Adia, I Love You, Do What You Have to Do, Path of Thorns, Possession, Sweet Surrender, Angel, and my personal favorite Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|this movie has a ton of gore and great action. it may have a bit of a weak story but its a great movie. the action is non stop and the creatures they fight this time r cool. the fight scenes are cool from gun fights to swords or hand to hand style. therers really not a lot to say about this movie. just action and gore.u should watch it. by the way its not supposed to be scary.
B00005JM4Z|1.0|This movie starts out with some pimp stuff...Paul Walker is a true pimp...I think he is about the worst actor ever to be born on earth...Without Big Vinny it is a pretty sad movie...Maybe if Vinny was in it, it could be a really great movie...See what really happens is that Aliens take over Paul Walkers body and some really wicked things happen...I will now give you a few examples like a bomb blows up in the best car ever the cadi, it is like crazy and this other guy named tyress...I don't really know about this guy but he is not the bomb...He just needs to stick to singing...I really never watched this movie because i was half wasted and then totally wasted in the first 5 mins of the movie...I drank this like big keg of beer on sat and then smoked like a mofo and could not even open my eyes at Blockbuster...it was crazy i ate this footlong hotdog last weekend...I thought i would tell you all that cuz i know you all love HOT DOGS...The movie that gets five stars ***** is Finding Nemo it is about a pissed off fish that kills these guys who were fishing in this pond and this fish out of no where comes and eats these guys out of the middle earth like in the Lord of the Rings or maybe Ringu about some chinese people who watch this movie and DIE!!!! Maybe if the Lord of the Rings had Paul Walker it would make it HORRIBLE just like the movie Fast and whatever 2...Go see something that really ROCKS like the school of hard rock...Just go to the movie store and buy anything except this horrible movie...ROCK on Johnny Knoxville you were great in Jack something...you a crazy guy and you know what i really wanna see Elf i heard it was great...Talk to ya later the movie guy
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I bought this album right on release day. I don't normally buy albums without previewing them first at the &quot;preview booths&quot;, but as an avid fan of Sarah, it's hard to go wrong. After all, her beautiful voice and sophisticated style and skills has won me over.<br />Well, I've heard this album at least 5 times in my car, and the only thing that comes to mind is &quot;bland&quot;. The current single &quot;fallen&quot; is the best thing about the album, but the rest of it sounds somewhat generic, as if you took all her previous songs, analyzed them by computer, and ran a program to generate new ones. It's not the same Sarah that I know and love. There are moments of brightness on a couple of songs that remind me of previous efforts of her brilliant songwriting skills, polished moody textures, and a genuine sense of fun in her previous albums. Her voice is a good as ever, but the script is darker. I enjoyed &quot;world on fire&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; is a unique song, but none of the other songs had me humming the tune, or strumming my feet. <br />Even if you are a diehard Sarah fan, give this one a preview before you buy....
0385509456|5.0|\\"THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT TIME\\" is a book that dares to take risks. It dares to be sentimental one moment and outlandish the next. This is a risky move that will keep Oprah and the Today Show from picking up an endorsement of it, but for the sake of artistry it is pure brilliance. It is the same blase attitude of cool to be rude, calculatedly ambivalence, offensively lovable, pitifully inspirational, and all around bipolarness that makes Rikki Lee Travolta's \\"MY FRACTURED LIFE\\" the must read cult classic in the making. You'll also see the same elements in the brilliant little F-U filled masterpiece \\"VERNON GOD LITTLE\\". Buy \\"CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG\\" not because it is safe, but because we need to buy books that aren't. Oprah reads these books the same as us, she is a smart lady. She also knows here advertisers won't support her if she publicly named this as a better book than \\"BOY ALONE AT SEA WITH ZOO ANIMALS\\". But we have freedom to read the brilliant books. We don't have to purchase what advertisers think are snow white bleached products of sanitized pulp. Buy this book because it is great. Buy \\"MY FRACTURED LIFE\\" and \\"VERNON GOD LITTLE\\" because they are even better. Buy great books because they are great, not because Oprah or the Today Show says they're quaint. Unless you're looking for quaint. And in that case, go enjoy \\"THE BOY AND HIS SEA ZOO\\".
B000002H6C|5.0|The swirling, odd-metered riffs of &quot;Blackened&quot;. The epic sprall of &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;. The sinister march of &quot;Harvester Of Sorrow&quot;. The churning and complex buildup of &quot;One&quot;. The raw unfiltered aggression of &quot;Dyer's Eve&quot;. There are just too many classics to list. If it wasn't for the awful production, this would be perfect. Progressive metal's genesis.
B000002ADT|5.0|Since 1997 when a certain someone introduced me into Jazz, I became interested into the world of Jazz and became a hobby and interest. Even though I was 21 years old, I became interested in the culture world of Jazz. This was the first CD I heard into Jazz and I couldn't believe how the music had developed over a song. IT was inspirational and motivating, refreshing and intoxicating. I became an avid fan of Miles and then Coltrane.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge Matrix head (I saw the second movie on Wednesday at 10 PM and the third on Wednesday at 7 PM).  That said, my reviewed might be a bit skewed, but several other obsessive Matrix types gave this movie poor reviews.<BR>I have few gripes about this film.  First, the big action sequence is completely CGI.  It's darn good CGI, but one of the joys of the first film was the knowledge that everything happening was real.  Second, Neo and Trinity get lost in the rest of the plotline.  After about 30 minutes of the big action sequence, I started to wonder what had happened to Neo and Trinity.<BR>Now, it's time for my rant about the good aspects of the film.  When I walked into the film, I had read the reviews already and was preparing my spiel for when I walked out of the theater.  \\"The Wachowski Brothers have really lost their reputations as good filmmakers,\\" I was writing down in my head.  However, about halfway through the film I decided, \\"This is actually really good!\\"  The Wachowski Brothers added just the right amout of humor to show that the movie isn't taking itself too seriously, especially involving the Kid.  The Kid is that guy who's obsessed with Neo because Neo saved him.  If you're all confused, there's a short in the Animatrix about him.  The Animatrix is probably worth renting just to see the killer CGI in Final Flight of the Osiris, but don't buy it.  Wow, I've really gotten off-track.  The plot actually provides good closure to the trilogy--don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  The plot also doesn't get lost in the philosophical dilologue like in the second film (for the record, though, I prefer the second film over the first).  The acting isn't too bad, either.  I know that Keanu Reeves is criticized for his wooden acting, but that type of acting actually fits the character quite well.  Hugo Weaving and the guy who play Bane also make up for the actors in the key roles.  We all know Hugo Weaving, but we don't know Bane well, yet.  Bane, if you weren't paying attention during the second movie (or if you haven't watched it four times, like I have), was taken over by Agent Smith.  Anyway, the guy who plays Bane absolutely NAILS the Agent Smith inflections.<BR>I think that I'm going to close with what my friend said after reading the reviews for this movie.  \\"They say that the plot's bad, but it's the same plot.  And they complain about the acting, but it's the same actors.\\"

He is just unhappy with his work and it doesn't give him the same satisfaction that it use to. During this time of contemplation he is sent out on a mission to a small Detroit suburb, Gross Pointe, and he finds out that his 10-year high school reunion is coming up in the same place. Desperate to get away to a new change of scenery he decides to go back to his hometown and figure out his life from were he left off after senior prom. He meets up with his high school sweet heart (Mini Driver) who isn't very happy to see him because he never showed up on prom night and left her standing on the front porch.<br />Dan Aykroyd plays an unwelcome colleague that keeps either trying to kill him or recruit him for a hitman union he is trying to start. Meanwhile, Martin is shocked by all the changes that have been made in the 10 years since he left his home town, and finds out that he is still in love with his high school girl and wants to try and make it up to her!<br />This is a very good darker sort of comedy, if you like John Cusack this one will not disappoint! Check it out!
0800177177|1.0|When I borrowed this movie from a friend (who unfortunately hasn't seen it yet)my expectations were high (academic prizes, reviews and all such stuff). I started to watch the movie with an aticipation for something really good and scary, but as the movie went on I was inclined more and more to laugh. My opinion about this movie can be summarized in a few words: a movie overdramatized and overstuffed with visual effects that got nothing to with the classic novel by Bram Stoker. The beginning looked very artifical (in the full sense of the word), the style was sentimental and so overdramatized that I couldn't get myself to believe anything that happened on the screen. Gary Oldman playing the count Dracula was quite amusing because of the fact that the fearsome vampyre looked like an eccentric fragile old man (G. Oldman acting an old man, yeah, a bad pun) with rather strange hairstyle and long crimson robe. Such Dracula looked more capable of falling apart from the first touch finger than of murdering the innocents and sucking out their blood. Jonathan looked like some bad version of Leonardo da-Vinchi (sorry, Leonardo di-Caprio) et cetera. The other rather horrible thing about this movie was its omnipresent eroticism. Lucy couldn't be that sexy just because it all happens in the nineteenth century and the views on sex there were rather strict. Dracula turning into something looking like large ape with long mane of black hair (meant to be a werewolf????) and half raping Lucy half sucking her blood was just ridiculous. The succubi in the castle were the only creatures that shoud have been sexy, no one else. Anyway sex is one of the things that destroy the atmosphere of gothic horror story, not creating it. In short, if you're a fan of Edgar A. Poe or H.P. Lovecraft, playing \\"Diablo\\" or listening to such stuff as \\"Iced Earth\\", to be precise, if you're a fan of the horror genre, don't watch this movie (whatever is said in the five-star ratings, they're all wrong).
B0000C6E4D|5.0|. . . . &quot;Afterglow&quot; because the songs stay with you even when you aren't listening to the album.  The album features a little more sonic ambience than previous works, but that's OK - the mark of a true artist like Sarah is where she isn't afraid to let her sound evolve.  Some reviewers are decrying the fact that the record doesn't sound like &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, which to me is baseless criteria.  It shouldn't sound like FTE because we've already heard it!  And the people who are saying she sounds bored, well, maybe they have their Celine Dion CD in by mistake.  My favorites are &quot;Perfect Girl&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Answer&quot;, which features great bass work by BNL's Jim Creegan.  &quot;Afterglow&quot; is flawless from the opening notes!
B00008DDXC|1.0|When I went to watch this movie, my expectations weren't too much high (still rememebering the first one). Still, the second Harry Potter movie succeeded to shock me anew with its complete stupidity. The acting is one of the worst ones I've ever seen, the story was damn boring and never succeeded to create the dark and gothic atmosphere of the book. Harry was shown like some sweety pie angelic boy when in the novel its clearly seen that he is a kind of tough guy that despite the enmity to Voldemort has got his dark sides, Ron looks like some completely idiot that has just left the asylium for mentally damaged people and the less would be said aboud Hermione the better. Why this movie is so dumb sentimental? Why Snape looks like some old woman (my wish to see Christopher Lee as Snape was never fullfilled)?<BR>Why the beggining looks like some goddamn TV comedy (aka &quot;Friends&quot;)? No idea. One last thing to say: this movie sets the record of the worst movie ever.<BR>P.S. The one star in the rating is for the soundtrack, the thing that was worth something in this &quot;movie&quot;. Otherwise it would have recieved no stars at all.
B00005JMFR|5.0|People, this movie is not about the battle scenes!!  That's like saying Titanic is a movie about an iceberg!!  If you don't like this movie, you perhaps need to go back to the theater by yourself and watch it again.  By far the greatest genius of this movie (and of course the two before) is that it becomes personal to the viewer.  You want an action flick?  Fine.  The Bible re-loaded?  Philosophy 101?  It's all there.  Of course, the critics who write drivel about the movie have only seen it once, after a lot of free booze from the PR people. Let's face it, this movie and the two before it will be the ones you watch over and over again for many years to come.  So few movies ever made will earn that right.  <br />To those who see God in the Architect and the Devil in the Oracle, I say look again:  If the Architect is God, then the Oracle is certainly the Divine Feminine, Mother Earth, human intuition, God as a \\"She\\".  They are the yin and yang it took to create humanity.  And by Revolutions, the Merovingian is looking very devilish to me.  Smith could be the devil (all evil) or he could just be the all-encompassing power of ego, \\"me, me, me,\\" which destroys the altruistic purpose of the Messiah.  Neo must put all personal interests aside (destroy his ego) to save Zion.<br />If the Architect is God, then why does he also come across as Karl Marx, the architect of socialism, so hell-bent on decrying human choice, hope and love?  If the Architect is Marx, and the Matrix is Marxism, is the Oracle human nature? Besides, if Neo is Christ, he is way too sassy with God, but calmly puts Marx in his place.<br />As for Neo, I am continually perplexed by why Hollywood overlooks the acting skill of Keanu Reeves.  He wears sunglasses in a lot of scenes and still shows more burning emotion and bottled up rage than anyone else acting today. Without using his eyes, or screaming profanity.  Think about it.<br />Stand-out scenes include Trinity and the Merovingian, Trinity and Neo, andSmith with the Oracle.  I don't want to give any plot away. <br />Here's why Revolutions will not win any Oscars or good reviews:  Critics and \\"the academy\\" are universally left-wing secularists, Mel Gibson aside.  There is religion, even Christ in this movie.  Some critics got far enough in Sunday school to actually pick up on that.  You can tell by how their reviews of the movie debate how realistic or original the battle scenes are.  People, this movie is not about the battle scenes!!  But a movie with Christ in it will never receive a good review or an Oscar from anyone hoping to work again in Hollywood.  Also, since there are no dysfunctional families in the film, no Oscars will be forthcoming.  That is the only way to win an Oscar.<br />Love it or hate it, you cannot afford to miss this movie.
6303109950|1.0|Wow, 246 Amazon reviewers, and they all think Val Kilmer is good in this movie. I don't know how anybody could watch this ludicrous performance -- the beady little raisin eyes, the strangled Brando-impersonation voice, the psychotic self-absorption -- and not recoil in embarrassment. Imagine not being able to out-act Victor Mature, who was actually a far better Doc in &quot;My Darling Clementine.&quot; Watch that movie and you'll see this for the souped-up high school production it is.
0671027387|5.0|First off, let me say I am a notoriously slow reader (just very busy)I take months, usually...I wish Mr. Brown's books lasted me a month, I cannot put them down!!! SO - After breazing through The Divinci Code in less than a week I immediately went to the library and checked out Deception Point and Digital Fortress. Unfortunately I started with Digital Fortress...it was just ok. I was then on to Deception Point...What a great, fast moving book! I think I liked it a little better than Divinci Code. Read it and Digital Fortress, but read Deception Point first. I am now onto Angels and Demons...so far it's awesome too! Regards!
0385504209|3.0|Unfortunately, Mr. Cook is very good at puzzles and very poor at ending an otherwise good story.  If you have a liberal arts degree, or have read literature instead of pop culture story tellers  much of your life, don't read this book.  Well, at least only read it until the last ten pages then throw it across the room (to paraphase Dorothy Parker).  That way you'll at least get more pleasure than waiting until after the last ten pages when you are so dissatisfied that you throw the book at a nice vase in your house.  You will get all hot and bothered expecting a real, insightful, clever and satisfying ending.  Instead you'll feel like someone got you all hot and bothered...then threw you into a cold shower.
B0000A36J5|1.0|Personally, I think it's silly to buy a movie for that price, because that's all it is...a movie (with some behind the scenes and \\"the making of\\" etc.) I mean I love LOTR as much as the next person, but that's it. I don't care to watch all that extra stuff, it's boring to me. This is what they always do for these masterpiece movies; they make a real special DVD package with all these documentaries and stuff just...booooring. Pretty soon it's gonna get real old and no one's gonna give into it.
1587990717|5.0|This is a book about probability and the way we misunderstand it.   Author Taleb introduces the concept of the `lucky fool', and reflects on how we (wrongly) ascribe positive characteristics to the schmuck who succeeds purely as the result of luck.<br />Taleb's domain (and that of the book) is the world of finance.  He is quite rightfully scornful of financial journalism, which attempts to fit rationales to the most insignificant movements in asset prices.  According to Taleb, most of this price activity is purely random, pointless to predict and futile to explain.  The flip side is the tendency of markets (and natural phenomena) to exhibit extreme, unusual behaviour that confounds conventional theory.   The occurrence of this skewed behaviour (referred to as the `Black Swan' problem) has plenty of precedents in financial markets and has bankrupted numerous traders and former experts.<br />As a general rule, practical advice on financial speculation is almost always useless.  If Taleb has a core belief, it is that `I may be a fool, but my edge is that I know I am'.  This recognition is not an exercise in humility; it is a prerequisite for success in a world where we are continually fooled by uncertainty and causation.  <br />Taleb's book is a convincing, entertaining lecture on probability and human nature.  His written style is little difficult to digest, possibly because of his classical influences.  His insights are fantastic, though.  Anyone who trades or invests should read this book, and reread it until the message sinks in.
1559409002|5.0|I am reviewing this item not for the feature (as I already reviewed this excellent film a while back), I am reviewing the Criterion Special Edition DVD, which is a two-disc set packed and<BR>loaded with tones of special features. The first disc contains the original theatrical version which director Herk Harvey edited some sequences and scenes out. The first disc also contains a really neat look back on the film in a 1989 documentary \\"The Movie That Wouldn't Die\\". There is also a very neat extra of 45 minutes of rare outtakes seen for the first time, and accompanied by the eerie organ music of Gene Moore. Some rare songs not heard in the original movie are here for your scary enjoyment. There is also a theatrical trailer feature.<BR>A very interesting look back on the locations for Carnival of Souls is included, and it talks about the history of the Saltair Resort, which has a very magnificent history and was used for the carnival location, this is an illustrated history. <br />On the second disc, there is a director's cut of the film, including some scenes not even shown on the VHS \\"director's cut\\" editions. One scene that is most notably absent from the original<BR>is the scene where the priest talks to the church carpenter about how strange Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is. This disc also contains a selected audio commentary by screenwriter John Clifford and the late Herk Harvey. Some excerpts of films made by the Centron Corporation. As well as an essay on the history of Centron. Some printed interviews with film illustrations are featured here as well.<br />This DVD-set is the best DVD-set I've ever seen. The image quality of the black and white transfer is unbelievably clear, and is the best image transfer I've ever seen. The special features are very cool, and believe it or not, the outtakes featured here are remastered in picture quality as well, along with the music score. <br />I was blown away with this DVD, and I'm sure you will be too. It is one of thebest treatments to a cult classic every put on screen. I am so pleased with this DVD-set I could just burst. I thank the Criterion people for making this a dream come true :)
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I don't know why no else pointed out how much they sound like the black crowes.  If you like the garage band sound and a throw-back to the rock sound of groups like the black crowes, you'll like them.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|This compilation can be divided into three segments: the hit-making years (the 70's), the transition (early 80's), and the nostalgic return. The first twelve tracks are from Summer's dynamic four-year run as the darling of commercial radio, the time of which she soared on the pop, R &amp; B, and disco charts. Longtime fans will know that many of the songs are parts of longer compositions on Summer's various &quot;concept&quot; albums of the period. But, even in their &quot;single&quot; form, the memories and Summer's talent still shine.<br />&quot;The Wanderer&quot; represents Summer's attempt to distance herself in 1980 from the disco backlash of the decade. It is more a &quot;reinvention&quot; than it is just a pop/rock tune. From the same decade comes her ill-fated collaboration with Quincy Jones in 1980. The master producer was responsible for &quot;Love is In Control (Finger on the Trigger)&quot; and &quot;State of Independence&quot;. Both songs display the stamp of Jones' production (intricate instrumental arrangement with guest musicians and a BIG chorus), but they did little to showcase Donna Summer the singer. It's as if Jones really didn't know what to do with a former &quot;disco diva&quot;.<br />Noticeably absent from this compilation are any cuts from her 1981 release &quot;I'm a Rainbow&quot;. Though it was not a commercial triumph, the work is probably the most personal and introspective of Summer's career.<br />Summer jettisoned Jones and returned with the monster smash &quot;She Works Hard for the Money&quot; in 1983. Featuring a killer bass hook and danceable rhythm, the song also veered into social commentary (as she had done earlier with &quot;Bad Girls&quot;), thus paving the way for the singer's return to the top of the charts.<br />Six years later, Summer would return with the pop-friendly (if lyrically lame) &quot;This Time I Know It's For Real&quot;, produced by the same team that introduced blue-eyed soulster Rick Astley to the world.<br />Now, with the emergence of interest in nostalgia, Summer returned following a successful VH1 concert with &quot;I Will Go With You (Con Te Partiro)&quot;. And disc one concludes with two new cuts that harken back to bigger days.<br /><br />The inclusion of a disc of remixes is also a treat for Summer fans.<br />It would be nice to see a FULL concept album with Moroder and Summer coming together for one LAST blast.br />Now, with the emergence of interest in nostalgia, Summer returned following a successful VH1 concert with &quot;I Will Go With You (Con Te Partiro)&quot;.

B000002R0R|3.0|Most GG fans agree this is not a &quot;real&quot; GG album. It certainly was the most controversial. But it is good, I'd hazard quite good, but then I don't care what anyone says. GG are an acquired taste, like scotch - the first time (albums) they are hard to swallow, but after that...<br />So, hearing this may make that scotch taste like beer, which is not what you want when you want a scotch. If you own any GG you should have &quot;Free Hand&quot;, which *I* always felt was their definitive album. Get that first. (At least both albums drove my non-Prog college roommates crazy).<br />There are songs, which, especially if this is your 1st GG album (it wasn't mine) are easy to take (which is why the scotch-drinkers largely dislike this one). At least it got GG on the airwaves, where outside of college radio, I first heard GG with &quot;Two Weeks In Spain&quot; and &quot;I'm Turning Around&quot;. I still find &quot;As Old As You're Young&quot; and &quot;Old Days&quot; infectious, it's pretty decent Celt/Folk/Prog rock. And it's hard not to like most of the rest of the album - it gets stronger and more frenetic towards the end.<br />Re the glitch - if it's the one I heard (keys not faded out properly for a split second) I've noticed it before but it never really bothered me, lots of bands have flaws on their recordings. But the reviewer who pointed this out may be referring to something else I couldn't pick up. If anything, I don't like the way the drum sound changes coming out of the phased acapella at the end of &quot;For Nobody&quot;.<br />With this album, way back in '77 GG may have unwittingly pioneered the unfortunate trend that many of their Prog master contemporaries did by conforming to the changing musical direction of the times (ELP &quot;Love Beach&quot;, anything by Asia, post-Going For The One, Yes, post-Seconds Out Genesis, etc.), so it kinda needs to be taken in context of the (coming) era it which it was produced.<br />I'd give it a healthy 3.5 starsbut I don't know how to do half-points.
B000002UDG|5.0|This compilation came out in 1987, following the uneven Press To Play and as a stopgap between his next solo effort, Flowers In The Dirt.  Key hits are included from Ram (1971) through Give My Regards To Broadstreet (1984).  Strange that &quot;Mull Of Kintyre&quot; from 1977 was excluded, though it became the Wings' best-selling single.  All the songs are winners in my book, but I'll just comment on a few.<br />&quot;Band On The Run&quot; the title track from the album that revitalized Macca's career, and &quot;Jet&quot;, just as engaging as its sister track, are the first two songs here.  The first is notable for its tripartite division, the languidly sung lyrics and melody, the mid-paced guitar, and the final explosion into its pop/rock splendour.<br />&quot;Ebony And Ivory&quot; was the first of three singles where he collaborated with an R&amp;B artist.  This one, with Stevie Wonder, is known for its extolling the virtues of interracial harmony.  [Tug Of War]<br />The rambling melody of &quot;Listen To What The Man Said&quot; also has with it bits of sax.  Funny how changing one word can give a totally different interpretation:  &quot;You can hear the people say that love is blind/Well, I don't know, but I say love is kind.&quot;  Blind, kind.  Makes a big difference. [Venus And Mars]<br />The ballad &quot;No More Lonely Nights&quot; from Give My Regards To Broadstreet, got to #2 in the UK, so he was still in top form in writing pleasant pop ballads like &quot;My Love.&quot;<br />&quot;Silly Love Songs,&quot; sporting a strong bassline, asks a time old question why we need those love songs.  Apart from being silly, they can be trite, corny, and downright nauseating at times, but Macca's got it right-people can't get enough of those silly love songs-myself included.  Piano, string and brass sections are also featured. [Wings At The Speed Of Sound]  From that same album, the sociable side of Paul is revealed in &quot;Let'em In.&quot;  He lists a bunch of relatives, and says to open the door and let them in.<br />&quot;Say Say Say&quot; is an upbeat duet with Michael Jackson before the two fought over the Beatles catalogue rights.  [Pipes of Peace]<br />&quot;Live And Let Die&quot; from Roger Moore's first Bond movie, proved that McCartney could still rock in top form, with racing strings and brass section.  The original tops the GNR cover by leagues.  Even out of context with the movie, the line &quot;But if this ever-changing world in which we live in/makes you give in and cry/say live and let die&quot; is applicable.<br />The dreary routine of an office girl who spends time alone in her apartment is described in &quot;Another Day,&quot; a UK #2 song following in the heels of &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey,&quot; a medley of  someone suffering from boredom and anxiety apologizing to the first title character for being insufferable.  That languid number turns to the uptempo second part.<br />&quot;Coming Up&quot; was released after the resurrection of his non-Wings solo career.  Again, cliched and trite lyrics that are nevertheless true:  &quot;You want some peace and understanding/so everybody can be free/I know that we can get together.&quot;  [McCartney II]<br />&quot;Goodnight Tonight&quot; has simplistic lyrics, but it shows how he could construct a catchy rhythm around them.<br />&quot;My Love&quot; is an archetypal McCartney ballad, slow melodic vocals, produced strings, and a lovey dovey sound that one either loves to pieces or deems too cloying and corny.  &quot;My love does it good,&quot; sings McCartney, and this song did Red Rose Speedway good as well.<br />A nice one disk set of Macca's greatest hits, which will do well for people who don't want to invest in the Hits and History double CD, both of which roughly comprise the same era.

B00005JMFR|1.0|This movie could have been a classic with a haunting ending, with the likes of the classic book \\"1984\\" by Orwell. They should have never decided to make it a trilogy, but instead the Wachowski brothers were money-hungry and wanted to ruin a piece of art. THE ENDING WAS HORRIBLE! The first Matrix was a great movie with a great concept. I then saw the Animatrix. If you consider yourself a Matrix fan, and you haven't seen the Animatrix, see it today. The Animatrix brought a whole new world to my eyes. I could just imagine the ending that was supposed to be. People are dependent on machines and machines are dependent on people. The Matrix Revolutions didn't tackle the question of all the humans getting released from the matrix itself. All of a sudden, the goal of mankind changed from releasing every single human from the matrix, into saving Zion. I would've liked to see a ending where nothing existed and everything died. Face it, the earth is ruined and both humans and machines need each other. I would've liked to see every single human wake up and not start a revolution but die. Having them die would mean that all the machines would also die. Neo should've had a chance to wake up every single human but decide not to. Humans cannot exist outside the matrix anymore. Humans might exist in total control within the Matrix, but this is the only way man can survive. Zion then would be destroyed. Yes, it should be destroyed. The cycle of \\"the one\\" would continue and a new Zion would be created. The lesson of the story would be the following: Mankind can no longer exist without the machines. There is no hope for the mankind to ever escape from the matrix. People could no longer exist outside the matrix. The earth's atmosphere is ruined and there is no food left. The Matrix is home. Man does not know of any other world or home outside the matrix. People need the machines to exist. The machines need people to exist as well, creating a perfect balance. This is the only way. If yousaw the Animatrix, you would agree. I would have like to see a solid ending, but instead I was fed a heap load of crap. The ending was left up to interpretation, but it didn't even seemed thought out. Some might argue that the ending of the movie meant all humans were released. If you would've paid attention to this movie and last you would understand that you are wrong. The architect said he'd release those that don't want to be in the matrix. Only 1% of the population don't accept, so only 1% are being released. What kind of revolution is that. I would have liked to see mankind realize they lost, even the movie metion absolutely anything about the releasing of mankind, but it didn't. The last two movies were flawed and were loaded with unnecessary story elements. The movies had some cool action scenes but never answered \\"why\\" or \\"how\\". How did Neo gain powers in the real world? Why did Neo get trapped in a world between the matrix and the real world? There are many question like this I have, but the movie never answers them. Overall, I was very dissapointed, and I recommend you see the Animatrix if you have questions about the making of the Matrix itself.
0140187537|4.0|I like this Steinbeck novel because it suggests ideas about morality, but requires the reader to further those ideas allowing the reader to form a relation with Steinbeck's ideas. I found this novel to be more insightful and thought out than a few of Steinbeck's other novels, notably Cannery Row.  While Cannery Row and even Of Mice and Men pave a definite internal path for the reader, The Winter of Our Discontent allows the reader freedom to expand his or her mind on the ideas of morality standards and temptation.<br />Overall, The Winter of Our Discontent reminded me of how much we, as humans, are saturated in a greedy, free-riding society. Steinbeck's story implies that maintaining one's morals within society is an impossibility, but the novel also challenges me, and other readers, to prove that wrong.

Notable PAUL PLISHKA como Timur, al igual que todos los secundarios (todos ellos 'de la casa') entre los que destaca la presencia del veteranisimo HUGUES GUENOD como el Emperador Altoum.<BR>JAMES LEVINE consigue una de sus mas destacables interpretaciones al mando de los cuerpos estables del Met (tambien extraordinarios coros y orquesta por cierto), dotando a la obra de toda la fuerza que precisa.

0767802470|4.0|I saw this film in the theater when I was a wee lad, and I hold it largely responsible for my lifelong fascination with Adolf Hitler's Germany and the men who chose to fight for it. Like most thirtysomethings, I grew up watching cornball American war movies and TV shows that usually depicted the Germans (and the Japanese) as comic-opera buffoons (\\"Hogans Heroes\\"), sub-human hordes fit only for a burst from a Tommy gun (\\"Bataan\\"), or cartoon bad guys with eyepatches, monocoles, dueling scars and varnished black boots, who smoked cigarettes with that peculiar European three-fingered grip and said things like, \\"You're being very foolish....we have ways of making you talk\\" but when push came to shove just couldn't seem to shoot straight (\\"Where Eagles Dare\\"....and how hard could it possibly be to hit Richard Burton's fat, drunken ass anyway?)<br />\\"Das Boot\\" was the first film I had ever seen that depicted the Germans as human beings fighting for their country (if not necessarily their Party, or Hitler), and it depicted them in all their vulgar, profane, humorous, sweaty, smelly, unshaven, drunken glory. Strangely enough, the movie (like the book by Lothar-Gunther Bucheim, which remains one of my favorites) decides not to give many of the principal characters full names, but merely ranks or first names(The Captain, The First Watch Officer, the Chief of the Boat, etc). I think this was done mainly to keep the 'everyman' feel of things, i.e., to make sure the audience understood that these characters represented the U-boat arm as a whole rather than any particular 'famous' boat such as Prien's, Schepke's, Kretschmer's, Endrass's, etc.) Many people were distinctly uncomfortable seeing the German soldier (or sailor), always depicted as a jackbooted, sadistic robot, shown as more or less indistinguishable from his American counterpart, and I am convinced that this is 50% of the movie's appeal. The other is of course that this is a submarine film, and they are ALWAYS cool.<br />The U-boat war against the Allies had a number of phases in which each side gained and then lost the advantage. This film is set during the fall of 1941, just before America entered the war, when the tide of the battle was turning against the Germans for the first time after a year of heavy successes against British convoys. The captain of this boat, brilliantly played by Jurgen Prochnow, is an 'old man' at 30 years of age (not merely because his crew is made up of 18 year olds, but because he is one of the few captains to have survived this long) with a half-buried hate for the Nazis and a grudging admiration for the British navy. His officers made up of a willing but rather naive war correspondent, a stiff-necked Hitler admirer, a clownish second officer, a combat-fatigued chief one step from a nervous breakdown, and a brilliant engineer whose wife has an apparently life-threatening disease. Nevertheless, these fellows know their business, and the actors, who (we are told from the DVD commentary) were not only drilled to look and act like real sailors, but recruited from all over Germany and Austria to give the film a feeling of how Hitler's Reich absorbed German-speakers from all over and homogonized them into a fighting machine of ruthless efficiency.<br />The best thing about the film, which is a director's cut edited down from the enormous, 18 hour \\"Das Boot\\" mini-series originally aired in Germany, is its production. The film takes place almost entirely on the U-boat, and the boredom, claustrophobia, tension, heat, stench and bad lighting seem to close around the viewer as if he were actually on board. In particular the depth-charging scenes are agonizing to watch, as lightbulbs burst, control panels short out, water spurts in from broken fittings and hull bolts, driven by the immense pressure of the ocean's depths, explode out like machine-gun bullets into the crew. The awful nature of the U-boat was that once it struck its target, it was essentially helpless and its destruction or survival depended almost entirely on the ability of one man, the \\"Kaeleun\\" (captain) to out-wit the enemy above.<br />Some reviewers have taken issue with the realism of the anti-Nazi sentiments of the boat's characters, saying that this follows the post-WWII liberal-revisionist German line that there were basically two kinds of Germans during the war: those who were simply fighting for their country and had no use for Hitler, and the Nazi villains who adamantly supported him and his crimes. Many English/American novelists hold this view, a la Jack Higgins, so as to be able to create both \\"sympathetic\\" and \\"evil\\" German characters. I half-agree with this. The German navy was an extremely apolitical and professional bunch, officers actually being forbidden to join the Nazi Party, and probably many officers echoed the captain's ill feelings in real life. On the other hand, having read works like Stephen Fritz's \\"Frontsoldaten\\" and the memiors of Gen. Hans-Ulrich Rudel, I have come to believe that belief in Hitler and National Socialism ran very, VERY deep in the average German for much of the war, and this \\"good vs evil\\" mind-set is largely a device of both the Germans and their apologists to avoid this fact.<br />\\"The Boat's\\" DVD extras are interesting, especially the featurette on how the U-boat \\"set\\" was a real U-boat (!) constructed from old blueprints by the same manufacturer who made them in the war (!!).<br />I strongly suggest that English-speaking audiences watch the subtitled version first rather than the English-dubbed version, although unlike most dubbed versions this one is dubbed by the actual actors, since most of the principals, including Prochnow, speak fluent English.

B0000DI7UR|5.0|Elements Pt.2, which comes almost right out after Pt.1, is completely different from its predecessor. This album is more direct, in-your-face music. If you were unhappy with the heavy use of orchestration in Pt.1, then you should be pretty happy with Pt.2, as orchestration is not at the spotlight this time.<br />This album sounds like a cross between the Stratovarius of old (namely Episode and Visions albums), borrowing some elements form more recent albums (such as Infinite) while still retaining the fresh sound that was found in Elements, Pt.1. One thing that may turn fans away from this album is that the ratio of fast to slow songs is the same as that found on Pt.1: there are two very fast songs, two mid tempo songs, three ballads and two slow, yet powerful and hypnotic songs.<br />Another of the main complaints with Pt.1 was Kotipelto's use of high notes, which could turn annoying some times. In Pt.2, high notes are used only in choruses and not throughout the song, and this time around they are done very well. There's only one song, though, in which Kotipelto's use of high notes can be annoying, and that song is Alpha &amp; Omega.<br />Let me give you a short review of all the songs in the album:<br />1. Alpha &amp; Omega (4.0/5.0) - This can be considered the epic of the album, but is not so much of an epic. The song starts with the sound of rolling waves, which would be the link between Pt.2 and Pt.1, because the latter ended with the sound of waves. Still, I think is a poor choice for an album opener. This is a very slow, powerful song with hypnotic drumlines. The bridge to the chorus is ballad-like. Overall a nice song, but Kotipelto's voice can be annoying some times.<br />2. I Walk To My Own Song (4.5/5.0) - The single of the album. Your classic mid-tempo Stratovarius song. The melody gets in your ears quickly, and the solo is amazing.<br />3. I'm Still Alive (5.0/5.0) - An awesome fast song which could've belong to the Visions album. Great chorus, and the vocal performance is very good here. There's a very good drum solo at the end.<br />4. Season Of Faith's Perfection (4.5/5.0) - If you're a sucker for ballads, like me, you'll love this song. This is an orchestral ballad (like Papillon from Pt.1, but only in style). The song starts very nicely until a very haunting keyboard interlude. The chorus is awesome.<br />5. Awaken The Giant (5.0/5.0) - Soul of a Vagabound, Pt.2. Much more heavier and direct than Vagabound. Again, another hypnotic song with a very nice drum beat.<br />6. Know The Difference (5.0/5.0) - A lightning-fast masterpiece. Sounds like a cross between Stratofortress and Find Your Own Voice, without the annoying high vocals of the latter. The chorus is excellent, and the use of keyboards is really good. Watch out for the cool solo.<br />7. Luminous (3.5/5.0) - The weakest song in the album. A very peaceful ballad. If you've ever listenned to Into Deep Blue, Pt.1's bonus track, then you know exactly how this song sounds. Great lyrics, but overall it doesn't do too much to me.<br />8. Dreamweaver (5.0/5.0) - A very agressive song. Easily the best one in the album. The song is mostly mid-tempo, but it can get fast at some points because of the constant time-changes. The chorus is one of the best for a Stratovarius song.<br />9. Liberty (5.0/5.0) - A power-ballad and a fantastic finale for the album. This feel-good song is the complete opposite of Forever, and I predict it will become the official closer for Stratovarius concerts. <br />All in all, a very good album which sounds very fresh. Personally, I found this album waaaay better than Pt.1, which was less-direct music because of the heavy use of orchestration. Pt.2 is more direct, and that's what I like when listening to power metal.<br />Heavily recommended.
B00005JMFR|3.0|I have to get some things off my chest, and since everybody's saying something I guess I could too. I was the only one out of the group of my friends who thought the first matrix would be any good. All I saw was a ten second preview of trinity slamming into the skyscraper window. From the quality, the directing of the film I knew it would be something great. That's why I was extemely disappointed as a fan and as an aspiring screenwriter to watch the Wachowski brother's writing weaken with the last two films. It seems they beleive that FX will take the place of thier writing. The reloaded FX were way too much. They could have been done in moderation. In the first film you said \\"Holy crap!\\" In the second film, \\"we've seen this stuff already\\". If they were to have done about four key scenes with new and exciting FX my response would have been the same, instead they relied on slowing things down in places where it wasn't needed. And why is it that if Neo is the only one to move like the agents that the scene at the beginning of Reloaded is using bullet time. Trinity can't move that fast, only the agents can. The Wachowskis must have had an extra mil. to throw around and use up running time. I'm not an authority here, i'm not forming thier philosophy for them, you make it whatever you want, but it appears to me that the Wachowskis got lost in thier own film and what thier own characters abilities are. In the third film I was dissapointed. You don't set up an amazing concept like the first film and then totally blow it off atthe end like they did. There was no resolution, no closureand who really won?! I would have thought the human race would prosper, but that the battle would be bigger, but then again there are alot of machines. After all Neo's discoveries about himself and the system, the Wachowski's decided to \\"tie\\" the game, as it were, at the end of the film. It seems to me that the Wachowskis' lost faith in thier own savior, in thier own hero. I don't know if Revolutions could have been written more solid or not. All i know is that the script was full of holes that the Wachowskis decided to not even press upon or even try to resolve. For instance, the scene in Revolutions where half of Neo is stuck in, what appears to be a \\"forbidden zone\\" of the matrix waiting for the \\"train man\\" to smuggle him back in, AND then his body's in a coma, but he was already unplugged at the end of the second matrix, so what is this??? Did part of his soul jump into the matrix without being jacked in?? How?? And what's with the \\"Final Fantasy\\" anime stuff? And in another scene where Neo and Trinity take Niobe's ship and head to the outskirts of the city; Neo can see things in an orange light, a \\"squiddy\\" comes at the ship, passes over, but the essence of the sentinel passes through his body? What was that?... The Wachowskis have clearly gotten confused somewhere along the lines about things they wanted to do, because some of this stuff didn't make any sense. It seems like they had extra money in thier budget. That's my piece, folks. All in all I'm disappointed by this, maybe I'm not that smart and all the answers are there somewhere. As Neo once said: \\"Where you go from here...is up to you...\\"
B00000I4XR|5.0|Jaws is not only the first blockbuster to gross over one hundred million dollars, a visceral thriller that showcases the art and craft of moviemaking at its finest, and a film that probably made millions of families rethink their summer vacation plans over the past quarter of a century plus, it is a cultural phenomenon that has become a permanent part of pop culture.  John Williams' theme to Jaws is immediately recognizable on both an intellectual and emotional level, whether you've seen the movie or not.  Major and minor problems alike are still met with the words, &quot;You're [or we're] going to need a bigger boat.&quot;  This twenty-fifth anniversary DVD release only furthers and adds to the legend, tossing extra features into the waters of our consciousness like so much delectable chum, and we are drawn to this aromatic feast of bloody entertainment the same way the star of this movie (which isn't Dreyfus, Scheider, or Shaw) is drawn to the smell of blood and the necessity of constant feeding as it slips through the oceans of our planet and, thanks to Peter Benchley, Stephen Spielberg, and others, the oceans of our very thoughts and fears.<br />This movie works on so many levels.  First, we have Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), a New York City transplantee who now polices an island despite his fear of water.  When a young lady is killed in the movie's memorable opening scene, pretty obviously by a shark, he allows himself to be dissuaded from closing the beaches by a slimy mayor who cares more for the holiday tourist season than the lives of the men, women, and children vacationing there.  When a boy is killed soon thereafter in front of basically everyone, Brody is rightly racked with a guilt that the mayor still doesn't understand.  A bounty on the shark brings all kinds of crazy people to the harbor, fighting each other in piddling little boats in a race to catch the killer.  It also brings shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and self-proclaimed shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) to town.  A shark is captured, but it soon becomes clear that this tiger shark is not the rogue killer terrorizing the island; Brody's son is in fact lucky to survive the ultimate proof of this fact.  Eventually, Hooper and Brody go out on the Orca with the eccentric, roguish Quint determined to find and kill the great white shark whom we finally get a close-up view of well over halfway through the movie.  This first real look at the mammoth twenty-six footer is brilliantly shot; having been conditioned to expect the shark only after Williams' incredible theme song begins, Jaws decides to make his first close-up a memorable surprise to the audience and, most especially, Brody.  The hunters soon become the hunted, leading to an increasingly suspenseful, riveting conclusion.<br />Many would view the shark as a monster, but if there is a monster in this film it is the mayor and local businessmen who sacrifice lives in the name of money.  The shark is just doing what he does naturally, feeding, and I cannot do anything but respect this remarkable creature.  The shark is nature's perfect killing machine, perhaps the most magnificent and certainly the most efficient animal on this planet.  This particular shark is as smart as he is huge, making him the most formidable of opponents for the Ahab-like Quint.  Certainly, such a rogue killer has to be either starved out or killed in the interest of human life, but I mourn the eventual defeat of this magnificent animal.  <br />This film was released in 1975, and the great white shark does not look terribly real today, but this takes nothing away from its magnificence and visceral impact on the viewer.  Spielberg shows his genius early on in his directing career by holding back our first look at the shark for so long; the early deaths are quite memorable and pack quite a punch as it is, with levels of blood and panic that make this a film that probably haunted the dreams of many younger viewers and a fair share of adults for many a night.  The final leg of the film is particularly extreme, making me wonder how this film got a PG rating.  One of the most compelling scenes of the film, however, does not involve the shark at all; Quint's absorbing account of his experience after the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis stands as one of the most emotionally enthralling scenes ever filmed.<br />The anniversary DVD edition of Jaws is simply loaded with extras, featuring 75 minutes of bonus footage, including several deleted scenes and outtakes.  The main attraction, though, is the feature Spotlight on Location: The Making of Jaws, which delivers incredible insight on the making of the film.  After watching these interviews with important cast and crew members and behind-the-scenes looks at the grueling, exceedingly challenging making of the film, this viewer's respect for the cinematic wonder that was created here grew by leaps and bounds.
B00005JMFR|1.0|In an effort to take its familiar animation style one technological step further, wasabis pioneered an effect called \\"deep junk\\" for its big-screen version of the matrix revolutions. The enthralling effect, which tricks the eye into seeing neos high-speed travels through the cyberspace in three dimensions, is just one reason to watch this surprisingly affecting tale of a misfit working to reconcile his differences from both machines and humans. At heart, it's an action movie, and a pretty hip one at that - neos motions, as he surfs along serpentine cyberspace and hurtles through the computers, are modeled on those of skateboarders. Plus it has a handful of clever set pieces in which no less than a vicious wasp, a sadistic hunter, and a herd of stampeding clones threaten the safety of the chosen. Many of these are funny, too - when the wasps debate whether a prankster citizen swimming in their drinking hole might be a wasp, one of them points out that it couldn't be because the wasp is indigenous to South America. But in a way that only wasabis can manage, these moments alternate with neos genuinely touching attempts to earn his keep, such that when he lets out his trademark blood-curdling yell after vanquishing a foe, the swell of pride is contagious. The vocal work is unspectacular, outside of will smith as a teasingly proper neo and spike lee as a neurotic elephant. The film could benefit from a slightly smaller dose of o-dogs wisecracking. But the most visually advanced film that wasabi brothers can produce is also one of its most insignificant, and even Phil lynotts dutifully inspirational score gets swept up in the general joke.
B00003CXGG|4.0|I'm a big fan of Jet Li, but I held off watching Romeo Must Die for a while in fear that a strong romantic plot a la Shakespeare would take away from the martial arts action I crave.  I needn't have worried.  This movie is many things, but a love story it is not.  The two main characters do come together despite their families' undeclared war on each other, but it is more an act of survival and friendship than romance.  This is primarily an action movie sprinkled with both kung fu fights and gunfights; unofficially, Romeo Must Die is a hip-hop kung fu film.  Of course, there has to be some comedy thrown in to lighten things up, and a rather nebulous plot that leaves one feeling a step behind the story at all times gives it that classic martial arts flavor.<br />One thing this movie has is a great cast, including the two new-comers of sorts.  For Jet Li, this was his first English-language leading role (although it was his 26th film overall), and for Aaliyah, it was her first of what should have been many more movies were it not for her untimely death a couple of years ago.  The supporting players are great, particularly Delroy Lindo as African-American crime boss Isaak O'Day, a man who is trying to go legit only to see a turf war erupt between his posse and that of a neighboring Chinese crime family.  Anthony Anderson steals the show, though, as O'Day's hilarious goon Maurice, shucking and jiving his way throughout the entire film, always rising to the comic occasion no matter how many times he loses a fight.  Jet Li is Han Sing, a former Hong Kong cop who went to jail to allow his crooked father and brother to flee the island for America; when he learns that his little brother has been rubbed out, he makes a most interesting and enjoyable prison break in order to find his brother's killer.  Aaliyah plays Trish O'Day, an independent woman who is ashamed of her family's illicit business dealings.  Han ends up seeking her out as the best lead for finding his brother's killer, and they eventually form a certain bond and work together as the killings not only continue, they hit ever closer to home.<br />The story as it plays out is a little bit confusing and hard to predict, with an ending that turns out to be quite good indeed, but there's a good bit of entertainment to be had alongside all the senseless killing.  Jet Li on the dance floor is a perfect example of what I'm talking about here.  Han can pretend to know hip-hop, but his moves on the dance floor are significantly less impressive than his moves in a fight.  Another great scene involves Han being attacked by a female martial artist; while he refuses to hit a woman, he comes up with a pretty handy dandy way of kicking her to the curb like she deserves.  Then there is Jet Li's football scene, wherein his character takes the thoroughly American game to a whole new level.  This leads me into one problem I have with the film, though.  Romeo Must Die, from the producer of The Matrix, suffers from The Matrix Syndrome, using wires to orchestrate acrobatic stunts for no reason whatsoever.  Things go so far here as to introduce &quot;ultra pain mode&quot; shots where we suddenly zoom inside a person's body to see the reaction to a punch.  There's just no need for Jet Li to fly through the air; the fact that he can take out every man in a large room without ever setting foot on the ground might sound cool, but it really takes something away from the otherwise gritty feel of the film.<br />Romeo Must Die is really an odd mix of martial arts, hip-hop flavor, comedy, action, you name it.  The soundtrack gives it a driving pulse you won't find in many films of this type, making this a movie that fans of several genres can enjoy.  There is plenty of action, although Jet Li's martial arts skills aren't put to good use nearly as much as I would have preferred.  The DVD is absolutely loaded with extra features: theatrical trailers, 3 music videos, 13 behind-the-scenes featurettes and interviews, and even more goodies for DVD-ROM owners.  It's a very enjoyable film, but its mix-and-match genre outfit leaves it unable to wholly satisfy fans of any one genre.d interviews, and even more goodies for DVD-ROM owners.

6305546789|5.0|This is a true classic of the Gen that you don't see made like this anymore. There have been many imitations, but none have even come close to the sheer terror this movie sparks. If you want to get this movie, seek out the Limited Edition or the last re-release of this with the Hologram cover or the one with-out the hologram cover of the same transfer. I'd personally stay away from the Divimax 25th Anniversary edition if you want to see this movie the way it was intended. The color timing is completly off in this edition, which gives the movie a whole different feel. The grass looks green in the 25th anniversary one. When is the grass green in Haddonfield, Ill. at the end of October? The lights from porches are white, when in the original previous Anchor Bay editions they were dim green, or yellow porch lights. These maybe little minor differences to some people, but if you're a fan of this cult-classic, it's a major differnece, and gives the movie a whole different feel that just doesn't seem right.After all the releases that Anchor Bay has done on this film, you'd think this one wouldn't have been any different than the others with the color timing, except expecting a difference in the transfer, ie: sharp, crisp, cleaner picture. Not change the coloring for God's sake. The picture itself is a slight improvement over the other releases by AB, as in being crisp &amp; cleaner, but the color is what screws this from being the &quot;Definitive&quot;, and last dvd of this movie you'll ever need.Needless to say I was disappointed at this, as I was intending on this to be the definitive release, and was let down by throwing the color timing completley off. The sound though is very nice, and having the Commentary track that was on the &quot;Criterion&quot; Laser Disc thrown in, of Carpenter &amp; Curtis, was a great touch. Please don't get me wrong though, I thoroughly enjoy this film no matter how many times I watch it, and never ceases to make you feel like you're being watched or something by some maniac, and you're going to be diced up at anytime. My only recommendation is if you haven't seen the film yet, (which I can't believe if no one has, especially a die-hard horror fanatic like myself), then stay clear away from the 25th Anniversary Divimax that is Anchor Bay's recent release of the film, and go for their last release of the film. It may cost you a few bucks for the Limited Edtion one seeing it's out of print, or the Hologram cover one, which is also oop, but the 2000 release of it that they sell here on Amazon is exactly the same transfer used on the Hologram cover release, and as it may not be as clean and crisp as the Divimax 25th, it at least is the correct color of the film, as was intended, and as was like in &quot;EVERY&quot; other Anchor Bay release of this movie. That's what burns me, is that color timing. How can they screw that up, when with every other release of this film by Anchor Bay, they were all correct? Inquiring minds want to know, but don't think we'll ever know? Aside of that it would be the definitve release of the film, but I guess we'll have to wait until someone is ready to do this right?Aside of all that hoopla, this is a movie that should NOT be missed, and should be watched and enjoyed by every horror fanatic out there. See where this whole Michael Myers thing started, with the best Halloween EVER. If you don't like this movie.... like, I mean, love this movie, upon viewing this for the first time or whatever, then you my friend have some issues. In my opinion. LOL. :O)  Enjoy the show!!!watched or something by some maniac, and you're going to be diced up at anytime.

B00003CXB4|2.0|Disney had a great opportunity to provide an in-depth look at one of the company's most beloved animated features. With its top notch animation, good plot, excellent characters, memorable songs and an evocative musicial score, The Lion King is amongst Disney finest. The 2-disc edition, however, is far from memorable.    There are some good features on the disc -the audio commentary, a couple of deleted scenes and a extremely brief look on the computer animation are the highlights of this DVD release.    The first disc opens with a flat computer animated sequence with Zazu flying towards Pride Rock. At least it's a slight improvement to the sequences on the two prior releases in the \\"platinum\\" series, Snow White and Beauty and the Beast.     The second disc serve some really nice menus with black silhouettes of animals towards warm backrounds. The content is shallow however, even though surprisingly few seem to notice. Many of the features have good potential. But just when they are starting to become interesting, they end. No features are longer than a few minutes, which naturally limits how informative they get. They creators have even decided to leave out the original 25 minute featurette. None of the trailers or TV spots are included. Many of the features easily serves as promotions of other Lion King related products.    It is hard to take this \\"platinum\\" edition seriously. Buy this to get the great animated feature (note that the \\"Original Theatrical Version\\" is a slightly different version than the actual 1994 theatrical release (some of the animation is altered prior to the IMAX release)). The picture is clear, the sound is good and the atmosphere is as captivating as ever. Just don't expect much from the supplemental features.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I'd be interested in what my reaction would be if I heard this album before loving all her other work. It's not *bad*--Sarah's voice is as lovely as ever, and there are some good songs. But the lyrics don't approach her previous albums, and while I don't agree with people who think all of her songs sound the same and she's elevator music, a couple of these songs make me understand why they say that. <br />'Time' is easily the best song on the album. The lyrics are good, and her singing is *interesting*, rather than just being gorgeous. <br />'Stupid' is actually a good song--not 'vintage Sarah', but I won't hold that against her. for a single, as it's distinctive yet not annoying. 'Dirty Little Secret' is a very pretty song, similar to 'Full of Grace'. 'Perfect Girl' is pretty, but a bit bland. 'Answer' is basically an 'Angel' retread (listen to that first note) with less interesting lyrics, but it's saved by Sarah's beautiful voice. 'World on Fire' is tolerable, sounds very good, but again could do with better lyrics.<br />'Drifting' and 'Trainwreck' are fine, but pretty boring.<br />'Push' is not a good song. The lyrics are *awful*, considering what she's done in the past. I don't think she should write the *same* lyrics, but everything about this song is a cliche. 'You've seen me at my weakest but you take me as I am' and 'You're the one true thing I know I can believe in'? That's not a song, it's lines from a Hallmark card. And don't tell me it's hard to write an interesting song about love. She's done it--'Sweet Surrender' and 'Ice Cream' aren't depressing songs.<br />In short--if someone likes Sarah because of her lovely voice and inoffensive music, they'll like this album. If they want her poetic, original lyrics that manage to express something perfectly, give Solace, Fumbling, or Surfacing another listen.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|At first listen, I too thought the CD wasn't everything it could have been, but after listening a few more times... and reading the lyrics, this is one of Sarah's best. <br />&quot;Fallen&quot; sent shivers down my spine...seriously, and so does &quot;time.&quot; I also love &quot;Stupid&quot; &quot;Perfect Girl&quot; and &quot;Answer.&quot;<br />In an interview, Sarah said that the cd is probably best listened to late at night, very loud, after drinking a lot of red wine... seriously, turn the cd up... and relax, it's amazing. She really hasn't changed her recipe from Fumbling Towards Ecstacy. Sarah &quot;live&quot; is what truly makes her a great artist, she was famous before Lilith Fair, but that put a face to the name, and Mirrorball just capitalized it all... another GREAT CD. <br />You may not be overly impressed, but give it some time.. it was so worth the wait!
B00000J7RZ|5.0|This is a very good CD of J.LO, and one of my favorite<BR>CD's in my CD collection! Below are some reviews of some<BR>of my favorite songs:<br />1.) If you had my love - You all should know this by now,<BR>they play it on the radio sometimes!<br />2.) Should've Never - a ballad song, that is very good!<br />3.) Feelin' so good - a duet with big pun &amp; fat joe, it's sort've a rappish poppish r&amp;b song.<br />4.) Let's get loud - the title says it all, it is a loud song and a fun song to dance to!<br />5.) No me ames - A beautiful duet with Marc Anthony! Awesome!!!<br />6.) Waiting for tonight - everyone should know this one by now also! <br />7.) Promise me you'll try - Another great ballad!!!<br />Well, those are my favorite songs on the album. And the other songs are good too but those are the best ones on the CD!! I reccomend that everyone goes out and buy this CD today if not, then buy it another day but be sure you get this in your CD collection soon!!! It's the best CD!!!<br />To Jennifer Lopez: I love you girl! You're one of my<BR>fave singers and actresses!!! And I love your voice<BR>when you are singing!
B00005JMFO|4.0|Just saw the movie...11;45 am showing and theater was pretty full..LOTS of characters and some took up time from more interesting and more realistic characters...think it will overall be popular, but will cause lots of discussions...which is a good thing..LOVED the lack of makeup and fearless actors showing lines and wrinkles...American actors would never do that...but who can hold a candle to Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson...it is quirky....go see it...bet you will like it...
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Brian De Palma's classic tale of the rise and fall of Tony Montana,a poor cuban immigrant who come to the U.S. at the height of Castro's reign in Cuba is a masterpiece built on the cocaine frenzy of the late '70's and early '80's.with appearances by legends like Al Pacino,Michelle Pfieffer and F. Murray Abraham to name a few,Scarface is intense and reaches across the borders of race and class to expose a much deeper current and a truth about all people.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Twelve-year-old Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes)is the only surviving heir to the chief(Rawiri Paratene)of a Maori tribe that is losing touch with its traditions.  As a girl, however, she is not qualified to assume this position.  Pai feels a tremendous load of guilt and responsibility toward both her people and her stern grandfather as a result--she feels that she can be the kind of leader her people need if only she were given a chance.  This fine film explores the tension between the necessity and inevitability of change as well as the importance of respecting tradition.<br />The cast of this film is magnificent.  Castle-Hughes gives the finest performance by a child actor that I have ever seen--even better than Sean Nelson in \\"Fresh.\\"  Her Pai seems completely natural, strong yet vulnerable.  Paratene and Vicky Haughton, who plays Pai's grandmother, also deserve special mention.
B00009RDG9|5.0|this movie is one of my all time favorite action movies.it was a little bloody but it fits the story and the characters.Benicio Del Toro is riveting as the black ops soldier who is being hunted by his own men.Tommy Lee Jones is equally powerful as the civilian survivalist trainer who is forced to track one of &quot;his boys&quot;.the movie is action packed from beginning to end and the girl who plays Benicio's girlfriend(sorry i couldnt remember her name) did and excellent job,the mannerisms and the dialect for the region were right on the mark.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I love this album. I'm glad they decided to put out a live disc. The DVD is great. Camera can get a little weird and annoying sometimes though, but you get used to it. CD is great, but lacks &quot;Scientist&quot;, but I can live without it, because the unreleased tracks make up for it. &quot;One I Love&quot; strikes resemblance to an old U2 tune, which is cool. &quot;Moses&quot; is solid and decent. My favorite track on the CD and DVD is probably &quot;A Rush Of Blood To The Head&quot;, just because it's been my fav CP song since I became a fan. &quot;Yellow&quot; has a cool intro, which is enjoyable. Those of you who have &quot;P&quot; and &quot;ARBH&quot; should complete your CP collection with &quot;CP Live 2003&quot;. Good stuff.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|I can remember waiting in line @ the RECORD store for &quot;kill &quot;em all&quot;. There's been alot of metal pass my ears since then. And while I can't put ANY band but Pantera up to early Metallica, Godsmack comes as close as anybody. Quit w/the AIC stuff. 2 different bands/genres. I'll take Godsmack over any &quot;new&quot; band from here on out. This disc showed me that they're growing &amp; learning. IMHO, &quot;Faceless&quot; kicks A**!!!! Later...
B00005JMFI|4.0|Family films have become awash in the bland, or have the feel of corporate marketing films--sounding as if written by a committee.  And there's an audience for such schlock.  Ice Age did well; Finding Nemo even moreso; even the Grinch, as awful as it was.  So when a movie that has sparks of originality comes along, you can't help but wake up.<br />Elf is the real thing.  No, it isn't great.  And the ending made me cringe a little.  But I'm willing to put aside the ending in favor of a warm and funny performance by Will Ferrell, some genuinely inspired writing, and a positive, sunny message about life.  Sure, there are some stereotypes here (like the miserly Mr. Greenway who wants his folks to work on Christmas Eve), but those shortcomings hardly detract from a edgy view of life and Elfdom that will put a smile on even the Grinchiest face.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Just listening to each track of this CD I am taken back to the visual images of the move, I have almost worn out my CD. This is, by far, my favorite CD of all times.
B00005JM0B|1.0|Why.  WHY?!  This movie joins Alien Resurrection and Jurassic Park 3 as movies that took a good idea, ran way too long, and ended up stupid.  this had so much potential and it just died.  We sat in the theater laughing because this is histerical, but it wasn't supposed to be.  The &quot;funny&quot; parts were boring and the serious part cracked me up.  Gotta say though, that the part where she locks him in a dog cage is kinda funny, again not meant to be, but it is.  Oh, and why would they pick Claire Danes for this?  She did nothing but scream throughout the whole thing, the relevation regarding her in the future was seen a mile away, and where was Linda Hamilton?  I'll tell you; she probably took one look at the script and wisely said hells no.  So easy solution, we kill her off.  <br />So sad.  go watch the frist two, forget yuo ever saw this one, and enjoy your Terminator world where there is a possibility of a happy future.<br />Terminatrix was hot though...
B00005JMFR|2.0|I would have woken up in my pod by now, cause my mind can't accept how empty and painful this movie is.<br />Revolutions just feels like it was made in an alternate demension.  All of the style and cleverness of the previous ones just takes a backseat to the war in zion.  This overglorified sfx battle is nothing like the battle that was implied in the previous movies. It just seems like the CGI guys got a hold of the LOTR software and went a little crazy.  If you fight machines with machines, why bother with Neo and friends?  Well, actually, they don't bother with them.  The cast we came to love is actually hardly seen in this movie, and the few scenes they have just make them feel dead already.  So it's hard to care about the meaningless sacrifices they make in the ending, if you can even call them sacrifices, it may feel to some as if it's for no reason.  I guess I just had my hopes too high.  I was expecting a Revolution or a Revalation, but it never came.  After the previous two movies, I really felt this was being built up into something special, but it only took something special away from me.  What is the Matrix? Greed.  A money-making system designed to keep us under control, while it turns curious human beings into consumer .... Seriously, I know money is good and all, but why sell-out and mutilate beautiful ideas just to get rich off the masses?
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I'm a fairly new Sarah Mclachlan fanatic!!! Having bought all her previous cds, i must say Afterglow is fantastic!!!  It was ok when i first got it but i kept listening to it and it gets better ever listen.<br />&quot;Fallen&quot; as her first single is awesome, to me it means a time of lose and uncertainty,<br />&quot;World on Fire&quot; to me means being alone and needing some one in this crazy world to help you get through it<br />&quot;Stupid&quot; is a killer song...it gets stuck  in your head for day.&quot;how stupid could i be, a simpleton could see...'<br />&quot;Drifting&quot; i dont knwo cause i really havent gave it a good listen yet<br />&quot;Train Wreck&quot; is a awesome song, crying out for help<br />I would  write  more but im to lazy to and im goin to bed...but the whole cd is awesome!!!
B00005JMFR|4.0|Okay, first, picture me doing a bad \\"Bill and Ted\\" impression while doing air guitar. Okay? Got that out of your system? Although as confusing and mindless as \\"Reloaded\\", that's not why I see these movies, I go and see them for the sheer action value, such as watching a episode of \\"Samauri Jack\\", it's not for the story, I mean c'mon. Please. In this movie, Neo is trapped between the virtual world and the real world, the world of the machines. Morpheus (stealing a joke from J. \\"Ray\\" Purlky of the Atlanta Constituition) has been eating food rations nonstop to become quite \\"husky\\", and I don't mean his voice, and Trinity is looking skinnier and haggard. A lot of stuff is karate-kicked and blown up, they use the Forklift suits from \\"Aliens\\" loaded with machine guns, more stuff blows up, and the movie ends on a surprisingly note. Enough? Go see it, but try not to think too hard, okay?
0743243307|2.0|Ali's writing is superb and she can describe place and situation as well as most anyone I've read.  However, the novel is dissapointing.  The heroine has an empty affair and is less than honest with both her lover and her husband.  She allows her family to break up, and her children to lose their father (although she supposedly loves him) without any attempt to try to save things.  But since she achieves \\"independence\\" in the process, we are unsubtly pushed by the author to approve.  In the end, I felt the story promoted selfishness.  The character development was also quite weak.  It was an interesting read, but unmemorable and hardly worthy of the Booker short list.
0060254920|5.0|Maurice Sendak's beautiful tale, \\"Where the Wild Things Are,\\" is about a young boy, Max.  Max, who is being a little monster in his wolf suit, is sent to his room without supper.  It is in his room that he enters his own little wonderful world of imagination.  Max's imagination takes him through the forest where the wild things are.  The monsters make Max, King and listen to his every demand.  Max has his fun in his world of imagination, until he grows tired of his adventure and he returns back to reality.  When he returns to his bedroom, he finds his dinner waiting for him, as he begins to pull of his wolf suit.  <BR> <BR>The best artistic element Maurice Sendak used was the increasing size of the pictures.  I have never noticed this in the past, when I have seen or read this book.  Now, that I can see that the artist used increasing pictures to represent Max's imagination, I am thoroughly amazed.  I think Sendak's idea of getting further and further into Max's imagination was brilliant, and truly serves its purpose in this story. The pictures increase as the story gets more and more unrealistic, more magical, or becomes more of a fantasy.  I can imagine this is how children really do start their fantasies.  Although, I do not think that most children would understand the use of the increasing pictures, but I think they can relate to it more than we think.  So, I would definitely use this story in my classroom, and once the children are old enough, I would share, \\"the little secret.\\"
B000002J1S|5.0|Heres the thing: Ive been saying since the first time i heard this album as a young lad of seventeen years of age, about 5 years ago, that this album predates, not only punk music but the whole bloody punk scene by 3 years! Gabriel is a visionary and he should be credited accordingly. <BR>  The music is progressive; by which i mean original, and not pretentious(i.e. YES{more like NO} or Emerson Lake and Palmer(more like, ELP! this music sucks!) Genesis used the concept album premise as a way to tell a story, and not as a means to blow their horns. Creatively speaking, Genesis were pushing the  envelope at a time where songs lasted 20min plus not because they had to, but because the musicians were too busy tripping over their self proclaimed egos! <BR>  This album, like any good music, takes a few listens in order to appreciate it. The lyrics are fantastic, the music brilliant and the musicians should be canonized for their performance. I wrote a review for this album when I first heard it, and I thought I should reiterate how much this album, and this band (71-75)gives a good name to an otherwise bleak period of music, represented by hacks like Floyd, YES and ELP who are so self indulgent they make Narcissus look like the Elephant Man.  <BR>  Get this album and dont take it out of your CD player until you have fully understood its brilliance. If you dont like it, I owe you a pint.
0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry's award winning novel, \\"The Giver,\\" describes a utopian society that is far from perfect.  In this society every individual is assigned a job or duty.  Jonas, the main character of the novel finds out that at the age of 12 he is to become the society's receiver.  As the receiver, Jonas learns about the memories that people all around him are holding.  He hears memories, which are both pleasurable and painful.  Jonas also becomes aware of the beauty that his society is missing out on.  The beauty of color, feelings and emotions are held in Jonas' hands.  Jonas is not sure what he should do with all of this information he is responsible for.  He wants to give it back to his society that has forgotten the important things in life.  Does Jonas give these things back to his society?  Or is he \\"released\\" like the others?  <br /> The best thing about Lowry's book, \\"The Giver,\\" is that it is filled with enough detail to make a very unbelievable society, believable.  Lowry slowly gives the reader information about the society, so that the reader does not become overwhelmed by such a unique and unfamiliar setting.  Lowry also leaves the reader questioning certain things, especially in the end.  This gives the reader an opportunity to come up with their own ending, or gives a wonderful leeway to discussion.  I think Lowry intended for the book to be written this way, so that it could reach out to different types of people.  I think anyone could find enjoyment in this novel.  In no way is this book limited to a young reader; it could very well branch out to high school and adult readers.  `<BR> I think the thought provoking book would be an excellent choice to read in a social studies classroom.  It describes a society that one might hope for, before they actually know what the consequences might be.  I am amazed at how realistic Lowry has made this society sound, to someone as young as 5th grade.  As an adult, I found myself reminding myself that this book was stilla fantasy book.  I love the fact that all throughout the book there are plenty of opportunities for discussion questions.
B00008J4P5|5.0|...The White Stripes have a flair for doing it their way. Any long time Rock fan knows that the &quot;rock-and-roll&quot; field has been mined dry for a long time. It's impossible to hear anything new and not be reminded of something that has already been done, usually a lot better, in the past. This partially explains why the majority of current music depends more on style than substance, and so many successful bands focus so heavily on their appearances while being clueless that their musical output is indistinguishable from other current and popular acts. Then, just when you think that Rock is truly dead, along comes an act like The White Stripes who proves, without a doubt, that Rock is indeed very much alive. It's as if Jack and Meg White have an understanding that there's nothing left to tell in the world of rock, but, &quot;we're gonna tell you OUR version of it.&quot;......and that is precisely what they do.  I am extremely happy to tell you that their version is exciting and very satisfying, with a mystique and charm that is almost extinct in the Rock world. Not since Nirvana did it in the early 90's, has a Rock act put such a strong heartbeat back into a dying genre. With songs like Seven Nation Army, The Hardest Button to Button, The Air Near My Fingers and Black Math, these two rock with such abandon that it's impossible, even for the most jaded Rock fan, NOT to feel a freshness. Jack White, simply put, is one helluva guitarist and a singer. All the comparisons to Kurt Cobain are somewhat correct, but, Mr. White is certainly a unique individual who holds his own. Meg White is the perfect &quot;steadfast&quot; drummer who wonderfully compliments Jack's wildly sporadic and innovative outbursts. If she were any better or any worse, it just wouldn't work, because as it is, their in-sync-ness makes an unbelievable perfect harmony. Her vocals on the beautiful and haunting Cold Cold Night are sweet, but, are also an indicator that she is a woman who has an understanding of what works and what doesn't, and her input is greatly needed to make the magic of this duo work to it's fullest. In a nutshell, all 14 of the tracks on this album are great, and have a consistancy and depth that makes the entire CD entertaining and exciting. Again, longtime Rock fans know that &quot;exciting&quot; is a word not often used these days. Elephant delivers it by the ton, and is THE best album of 2003.
0060245867|5.0|Numeroff's main character, a tiny mouse, becomes a BIG chore for a young boy.  After the mouse asks the boy for a cookie, the boy quickly learns that it will not stop there.  The mouse becomes more demanding as the story goes on, wanting something new every flip of a page.  The book carries the reader through fun activities and scenarios that the boy sweetly accommodates the mouse through.  The boy's entire day becomes centered around a tiny mouse with endless demands.  Will the demands of the tiny mouse ever end?  Or will it be the story that never ends? <BR> I think Numeroff's book gives a humorous view on a very imaginative situation.  Children are sure to love this book with its funny plot and illustrations.  Not only does the boy in the story find himself tending to a bossy mouse, he also faces the chance that it might all start over again in the end.  <BR>The story gives an excellent introduction to cause and effect for young readers.  Phrases such as if you, when you, when he fill the pages describing what happens after something else happens.<BR>The illustrator, Felicia Bond used colored pencils to capture the excitement of the boy's day.  The vivid colors keep the reader stimulated through each page.  The pictures also do an amazing job of helping to develop the plot.  Without the illustrations, the story would not be as effective in portraying the craziness of the boy's day because of the mouse.  The pictures definitely make the story more humorous for any reader.  <BR>I have loved this book for years.  Although, I never realized it was really the illustrations that were making the book so wonderful.  Without the pictures, the story would not be exciting, attention-keeping or climactic.  However, combining the illustrations with the story line creates a funny and exciting story that any young reader could enjoy.
6305499365|5.0|This is a comedy masterpiece in so many ways... Great lines that never get old, great characters, and well, I can kind of relate to Peter's character (If you've ever had/still have a job you can't stand, you will too!) <br />I seriously could NEVER get sick of this movie- One weekend I watched it about 4 times in one day :)<br />I really hope Mike Judge continues to make movies, he is a GENIOUS! but I really wish he didn't stop Beavis &amp; Butthead...<br />If you could just go ahead, and go buy this movie if you don't have it already, that would be great, mmm kaaay?<br />Nothin like smashing a printer in the middle of a field :)<br />or putting fish heads on TPS reports :)<br />or, um ok i think i've said enough...<br />GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
0385504209|1.0|I found The Da Vinci Code to be an insult to my intelligence. Anyone who paid attention in high-school math and history class can figure out the codes. And while the theology is interesting, concepts are reiterated so many times I felt like there was going to be a test at the end. Brown actually stops the action of the novel to explain everything to the reader. C'mon, now.<br />The characters were flat, static, dull, monotonous...Little to no attention was given to their development. I didn't get to know them and I didn't care one bit about any of them.<br />The faux-suspense created at the end of every chapter was tedious and condescending. And why so many chapters? Not all of us have the attention span of toddlers; there are intelligent learned persons out here who read books all the time. Give us a break.<br />This book was written to the lowest common denominator of America and it makes me cringe; half because Brown allowed himself to do it, and half because it just shows how many ignorami there are out there.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is an awesome album, I absolutely love Britney Spears, she's definitely a true performerand a true talent. I loved her first two albums, but this one far surpasses both of them. Britney has the awesome ability to continually grow, learn, and get better and better with every album. Anyone who loves Britney needs this album. I am so excited for &quot;In The Zone&quot;!
B00005B58Y|4.0|Is this a great album? By all means! Is it Miles' best? No. It's an album that lies along the way to a second ascent to genius (after the 'Birth of the Cool') with the recording of 'Kind of Blue' to bring the new modal approach into Jazz. With an amazing lineup almost ready for prime time (only &quot;missing&quot; Bill Evans on piano to Red Garland's great playing), Davis presents tracks from Jackie McLean (the killing opening track), Gillespie and Monk, as if to take one last solid look at the (recent) past of jazz to get ready to embark on a new sound for it.<br />My favorite track of the whole album, the title track, which is presented in two different takes, for the listener's enjoyment.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This trilogy is nothing short of amazing.  My strong opinion is that people viewing these movies did not want to *think* when they were watching it.  People as much as said that they didn't understand the movie then go on to bash it.  Incredible.<br />I think all three movies together create a profoundly deep, entertaining, and exciting story that will be entertaining people for hundreds of years.  Revolutions was no exception.  If you want to see this movie, don't go in expecting it to be a certain way, go to watch the story unfold and see if you like it based on that.  It is NOT a re-hash of other movies, it's fresh, entertaining and quite original.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This is a great CD! I just picked it up yesterday and listened to it.. I find that there isnt really a song on the cd that I dislike!
B00005JMFO|4.0|Richard Curtis, the director of \\"Love Actually\\" wrote the scripts for \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" Notting Hill\\" and co-wrote \\"Bridget Jones' Diary.\\" So he knows of what he speaks, romantic-comedy-wise.<br />\\"Love Actually\\" is literate, smart and has enough horse sense to realize that in most cases Love is complicated, hotly sought after and rigorously fought for: in other words it's not a walk in the park though, it often takes that route.<br />Curtis has assembled many of the same faces we have seen in his other comedies: Hugh Grant, Colin Firth to name a couple and all the other actors are charming and quite attractive, but I think in order to give this film the flavor of the others mentioned above, he may have given us too many sub-plots of which some are not as interesting as others. But chalk this up to first time director jitters because so much of what Curtis puts on screen is fun and witty. In particular Bill Nighy as Billy Mack, an almost washed up Rock Star looking for a comeback hit record, who records a Christmas version of \\"Love is All Around\\" and promotes it to a apoplectic radio dj as instead of from \\"some smug teenager... from an old ex heroin addict looking for a number one record at any price.\\"<br />Though Curtis has applied the kitchen sink style of directing to this his first feature, most of what he does works i.e. its funny or charming or both. What he has created is a big gold box tied with a giant red bow of a movie: one that you can take a date to, invite your English teacher to or take your spinster aunt to. \\"Love Actually\\" then is about all of us who have ever jumped into that big morass of goo called Love, survived scathed or unscathed, not always smarter for having done it yet forever willing to try it again.
020161622X|1.0|This book includes a lot of obvious advice (like keep your designs simple --- the KISS principle), and is lacking in any profound insights about how to make it so. The material on Design by Contract elevates a marginally useful idea to a major breakthrough, which it is not. One wonders whether the authors have much field experience writing large systems.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This concert is one of the best concert that I have seen in the last years. The singers, the songs, the sound and the images are extraordinaries. The performer of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr give a unique credit to this memorable concert. It is a true tribute to the great composer that was George Harrison.
B00005YJMX|5.0|What more can be said about tis movie? A true treasure. Klaus Kinski gives his best performance as Count Dracula. The movie scores high points on all levels, the story book village, the beutiful landscape, and of course the Count himself. The makeup for Kinski is superb and fits his role. The story is of course Jonathan Harker's trek to Castle Dracula, in the land beyond the forrest there he meets his host, the centuries old Count Dracula. This ranks high above any Dracula movie ever. The film is dream-like with Great music throught out. Watch for Renfield, a stand-out! The most beutiful and greatest Dracula ever!
0449211002|5.0|I have loved every novel written by Mary Stewart, some more than others.  I read this one well over twenty years ago and many times since then.  It is one of my many favorite of her books.  In her books you get to travel; you feel as if you are really there. I have wanted to visit almost every place I have visited in her books.  I too had pledged to see the Lippizaner stallions someday &amp; I finally got to see them a few years ago.  They were wonderful of course.  There is magic in all the Mary Stewart books; the relationships in this one in particular were warm and appealing.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This album is excellent.  Don't pay any attention to the negative reviews. &quot;Fallen&quot; is haunting,&quot;Push&quot; is an excellent song, especially if you are involved in a meaningful and true marriage (or relationship). &quot;Answer&quot; is vintage Sarah. Yeah, so it sounds a little like &quot;Angel&quot;, who cares, it works!  <br />Buy this album. It is great. You will not be disappointed.  Every album cannot be the same as the last, what would be the point?
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is an amazing movie.  My three-year-old daughter, my husband and I have watched it six times in the past two days.  Be warned though, if you have young children, the start of the movie can be a bit scary when the mommy fish and the babies are eaten.  We fast forwarded through that scene and the rest is just an underwater delight.
B00003CXC7|5.0|One of the best films made by Hitchcock.  Once again the master shows he is the master of suspense, even with a very limited setting.  Nice last line.
B00005JMFR|3.0|If Revolutions isn't what you expected, perhaps its time time to scale down your expectations. The film returns to its roots, sort of, by refocusing on the struggle between Zion and the machine world and Neo's role in bringing down The Matrix. Not everything is what it seems, though, in this complex, loud action thriller.<br />When we last saw Neo he was in a coma. Some of his abilities from the Matrix had intruded upon the real world. As a result, he was able to stop the squids from killing him and his crewmates. Evidently he's stuck between the machine world and the human one. He's stranded in a program that manifests itself as a subway station. His only way out is to get on the train that runs through it but the trainmaster is in the employ of the evil French character from the second film. That's not going to happen without some intervention from Trinity and Morpheus (which does eventually occur though to say how would spoil it).<br />Agent Smith has occupied the body of a human survivor of an attack by the Matrix. He's now able to battle Neo in the real world. He's also multipling in the Matrix taking over programs without end and reshaping the Matrix's interactive human landscape in the process.<br />The main weak point of the film is dividing up the trio of characters at the heart of the film; Trinity and Neo end up on a journey to Machine city where the ultimate confrontation may or may not occur. While Morpheus is shunted to the side as he tries to get back in time to help save Zion. The performances are, as usual, stellar. The point of the Matrix films, though, isn't the acting as much as the visuals, stunts and psuedo intellectual discusses the characters have. So it's a good thing that the Wachowski brothers have four (including Hugo Weaving in his marvelous performance as Agent Smith)strong actors in the lead roles.<br />The visuals are much more convincing here than in Reloaded. Although the sequence on the freeway in Reloaded was great looking, there were many substandard effects shots in that film. While there are times (such as a few of the scenes during the assualt on Zion City)the CGI effects aren't completely convincing, that's not too great a sin; consider what they would have looked like with matte paintings, miniatures and stop motion models by comparison.<br />The film isn't quite the classic that the first Matrix was but is an improvement over Reloaded. Revolutions manages is closer to the spirit of the first film in many respects and the parts of the film that echo the quality of the first film are the strongest as well. The conclusion is both bold and idiotic. I was really surprised by the choices the Wachowski brothers made. I said idiotic because they aren't the most commerical and that's a credit to them; they felt that the story had gone as far as it could go.<br />This film, like Reloaded, is about twenty minutes too long. It seems that the Wachowski's and their editor felt it was necessary to give as much screen time as possible to the battle in Zion City because of all the expensive CGI effects (or perhaps they just didn't know how to cut the sequence). Revolutions meanders just a bit but is still enjoyable entertainment. If you're expecting enlightenment, you'll be sadly disappointed as not all the &quot;answers&quot; are provided. It's just as well as Revolutions had the potential to spiral out of control into a mess (much like Lucas' latest Star Wars installments).<br />Revolutions is an action packed film with many surprises. If you give it a chance, you'll enjoy the film. While it runs about twenty minutes too long, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday night.were many substandard effects shots in that film.

0385504209|5.0|I just wanted to add my voice to the choir.  This book is marvelous.
0446530891|3.0|Baldacci is going to have a hard time topping his first four books (&quot;Absolute Power&quot;,&quot;Total Control&quot;,&quot;The Winner&quot;,&quot;Simple Truth&quot;)<br />After that, his plots weren't as devious or slick and the revelations seemed tired. With &quot;Wish You Well&quot;, nice try, good intetions but ZZZZZZZ and &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; his storytelling just evaporated.<br />&quot;Split Second&quot; is a return to the style of the first four books. And it's very fast reading. But his skill has always been having all the plot threads unravel quickly as you get closer to the end. This time, those revelations aren't as exciting as the setup that proceeds them.<br />Instead of thinking &quot;Cool!&quot;, I thought &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />However, it's still above average compared to other contemporary suspense novels, just below average for Baldacci.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Boy what a conundrum!  To like or not to like this film seems to set a precedence with the reviewer as either a bonafide moron or a person who enjoys something that might be a breakthrough in the comic-book to movie industry.<br />Well, I liked it . . . a lot.  Why?<br />This is a film made for the comic book fan (I loved the original comic books with their great artwork).  Ang Lee (the director) even pulls up images on the screen (occasionally) that are block-like, giving you the feeling that you're watching a type of moving comic book, but with real characters.<br />The cast of characters in this film is impressive, too: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte and Sam Elliot.  It's just a shame that a bit more time wasn't taken to go over the script and fix a few dialogue problems.  Some of it seems forced, just a patch-work to help the plot move along.  But...<br />This still didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film for me.  New ideas were incorporated (something that some 'Hulk Purists' might find offensive), and I found them refreshing.  Let's not forget that the Hulk comic strip never stayed static, either folks.  In this film, nano-technology was introduced.  But it never became over-burdensome with techno-babble.  The action of the film and its characters stayed in the forefront of the film.<br />The movie follows pretty closely the development of Bruce Banner into the Hulk.  Except here, there's a genetic component along with the nano-machines and Gamma radiation accident.  Ang Lee also incorporated some great family dynamics that come back to bite the audience on the nose.<br />It was a good film.  I really enjoyed watching it.  I might even watch it again.  Enjoy.<br />A- rating
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is an intelligent, darkly funny and beautifully crafted film. Everything about it is sheer quality - casting, performances, production and soundtrack. It is subtle, and haunting, with even the minor characters given depth by their portrayal. I would absolutely recommend it.<br />For me, one of my favourite parts of this movie was a minor subplot involving two characters. Drew Barrymore imbues her excellent portrayal of the high school English teacher trying hard to reach reluctant students with great compassion, especially in the byplay between her and the young Cherita Chen. It's a touching and evocative portrayal of the hidden compassion teachers can feel for particular students, of the general struggle of teachers today who care about their students. It's hard to describe it, but it's absolutely magnificent.<br />This movie is worth buying because it's worth watching more than once; there are complexities and nuances of the plot itself and of the minor characters that reveal themselves only on subsequent viewings.
0783240236|2.0|'The Birds' is one of his \\"classics\\", but it is not a good movie.  The concept is bad, the graphics are bad, and it is too simplistic of a story to be compared with Hitchcock's best films.  Every artist has a dud once in a while.  It looks like great Alfred had his with this one.
0790733226|5.0|i think the movie and book are both excellent.<br />for those who have seen the movie/read the book, i highly recommend you read brian greene's, \\"the elegant universe.\\" i say this because greene's first few chapters about einstein's general relativity will easily explain the \\"contact\\" ending very well; i'm talking about how jodi foster's character's time perspective was different than the viewers on earth, but BOTH are valid.
B00008DDSC|2.0|two stars for good acting, but this movie is pretentious beyond belief.  under the guise of an s &amp; m love story, it smugly dares you to say otherwise.  if you don't like it, it's not because it's downright awful; it's because you're uptight and unable to appreciate alternative lifestyles. like many, many movies out now, this one insults the intelligence of its audience by offering up pure drivel disguised as art.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Unfortunately, this is the first Opeth album I have ever owned. That is not to say I wasn't familiar with their sound, and so when I bought this I was expecting beautiful accoustic melodies accompanied by brutal metal licks. However, there are no brutal metal licks here. And I was not disappointed what so ever. Whatever my expectations were, Opeth ripped them appart with one of the best musical experiences I have ever been through. If you love anything from Pink Floyd to Santana to My Dying Bride to Days of the New, from folk rock to psychadelic to goth rock to heavy metal, you can find something you love here. Even though the guitars aren't often distorted, the licks are still in true metal style. Let's put it this way; in 3 years of dealing with Amazon, I have never had a reason to write a lengthy review of anything I have ever bought until now. That should speak a thousand words!
B00005JMFR|1.0|I saw this on opening day.  It was a complete waste of time.  The 'Animatrix', a prequel to the series that I own on DVD, was a lot more interesting.<br />My guess is that the Oracle manipulated Neo in order to destroy him because Agent Smith is really Neo's doppelganger (like evil Superman).<br />My expectations on plot development were high, given where we were left off at part 2.  Even if part 3 didn't answer all of the questions raised in the first two parts, it should at least have posed more interesting questions.  This did not happen.<br />The movie will probably appeal to those 15 years old and under.  The overplayed video game-like sequence at the defense of the docking station was mind-numbing.  The love scene between Neo and Trinity just drips with cliche - just the sort of thing from a 15-year old's unsophisticated mind.<br />This was the rip-off of the year in movie-going if I ever saw one.<br />Don't waste your money.  Rent the DVD when it comes out - if you must.
630356643X|4.0|In the late 1980's, I remember seeing this film.  The original version and the longer and most grossest version.  I remember how much fun it was to watch.  This review is for the 94-minute version on VHS where most of the violence and gore have been cut out, but the film has been lengthened too.<br />  Jeffrey Combs plays a cold-hearted doctor, Dr. Herbert West, who makes a decision to accept a room-for-rent with a couple, Dan (Bruce Abbott) and his girlfriend (Barbara Crampton, (Days of Our Lives [1983], Young and the Restless [1988-2007], Guiding Light [1993-1995], The Bold and the Beautiful [1995-98]).  Dan Cain is a medical student.<br />  Dr. Herbert West is like a modern-day Dr. Frankenstein.  He has invented a luminous serum that when injected (kind of the same has [[ASIN:6305770328 D.O.A.]] [1940]), except it was poison) into someone dead, the person comes back to life as a fighting zombie.<br />  Peter Kent plays the first nude male zombie who puts up a fight.  Peter Kent was also Arnold Schwarzenegger's double in the film, Terminator (1984) and other films.<br />  Lots of fun nudity and grossness.<br />  Note: The soundtrack is NOT from [[ASIN:0783225849 Psycho (Collector's Edition)]] (1960), but it is a similar music score in some parts.<br /><br />  Followed by:<br /> [[ASIN:B00009YXHN Bride of Re-Animator]] (1989).<br /> [[ASIN:B0000DC12T Beyond Re-Animator]] (2003).<br /> Herbert West: Re-Animator to be released February 15, 2018.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|This album has changed my life. I was in a car accident and the other driver was listening to \\"Chariot\\" now I understand why he was so distracted. His emotionally astounding, insightful, heartwrenching, dancey, deep, touching, thought provoking, head bobbing, car dancing, groundbreaking, mature, ...., blusey, unique, meditative, metaphysical, lickable, melodic, earth shatering, arresting, poetic, mind blowing, dreamy lyrics have forever altered my existence. I now realize why I was put on this earth, I am a faithful disciple of Gavin Degraw and worship him every day. In summary EVERYONE IN THE UNIVERSE should own this album.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Her first single Fallen is one of the better songs on the CD, I think. Her music has a lot of piano for background this time around. If you have liked any of Sarah's music previously, I assure you that you will be satisfied with this one. The lyrics are very powerful this time around and are personal to Sarah, who lost her mother since her last album and also became a mother. I recommend this CD to any Sarah fan!
B000006MS3|5.0|It was the fall of 2002 and my second year in college. I was talking to my English professor and he made a comment about the shirt I wore to class, the cover of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. He said, \\"best album of all time... want to know the second best?\\" I said, \\"This one is the second best... the first would be Radiohead's Kid A.\\" Anyway, to make a short story shorter, we traded. I lent him my copy of Kid A, and he lent me a copy of what he thought was the second best album of all time, The Dreaming. I saw the copyright date in the back, 1982, and thought, oh, it's probably gonna be some cheesy sounding early 80's music... to my surprise, this album did not sound \\"totally 80's\\" at all. It sounded like it had just been released this past Tuesday! I was in awe with it's muti layered sounds and \\"overproduction\\"... and the complexity and complete strangeness of it. FAR superior and WAY ahead of it's time... even for today's standards! I thought Kate's voice was brilliant. The music was brilliant. The effects were brilliant. This album is brilliant. So, now I'd have to say, I agree with my English professor. It is the second best album of all time... just behind Radiohead's Kid A.
B00005JMFR|4.0|I can't really say I found the Matrix Revolutions to be totally disapointing. It had tons of action eventhough most of it took place in the real world with man verse machines. I would've liked more kun-fu and more action in the matrix but the action we get is still loud and exciting. After seeing the first one and hearing that sequels were gonna be made I was excited. I expected new villains and different plots but we don't really get that. The trilogy is just one movie with the same plot.<br />  I would've liked to have seen Neo fight a new main villain in the sequels but instead we get Agent Smith again. Not just one but a whole lot of him. I admit that's entertaining because Hugo Weaving is great in the role. It's not much that can be done with the same villain over and over again though. Neo and Agent Smith's fight should've ended in the first one, was not really a need for him to come back. None of the Neo/Agent Smith fights are even as good as their battle at the end of the first one.<br /><br />  It's still not bad though, it looks great and the special effects are awesome. The Wocohwski's direction is well done. They throw a lot of action at you all at once during the battle for Zion scene but you always know what's going on. If it was badly directed you would be lost in a scene like that. They made an intense and exciting movie, we don't get an entirely satisfying ending but it's not really a bad ending. It does make you want to know what happens next though even if there isn't really a need for a part 4. The ending just makes you confused and mad about some of the fates of the characters. The first was a fun cyber-punk/sci-fi/thriller and the second is slow but when it's not it has some really fun action scenes. Revolutions is darker, more violent and not as much fun as the first too. It's still entertaining but not as fun as the others.

B000002QWD|5.0|I love Christmas music, often pulling it out to listen to mid-year.  And you'll never catch me listening to anything but Christmas music from Thanksgiving to Christmas.  That's why I'm a little ashamed to admit to only just now getting this classic collection.<br />What I've been missing all these years is a truly wonderful CD.  Bing has a rich, strong voice that is pleasing to listen to.  The arrangements feel dated, but that's part of the charm.  It feels like an old friend from the very first listen.<br />My only real complaint (and a minor one at that) is the pacing of the album.  The first six tracks are all slower numbers.  They do include a great version of &quot;Silent Night,&quot; and Bing's classic recording of &quot;White Christmas,&quot; so I do enjoy listening to them.  Still, by &quot;I'll be Home for Christmas,&quot; I'm ready for an upbeat track.<br />Fortunately, the second half doesn't disappoint in that regard.  &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus is Comin' to Town,&quot; both sung with the Andrews Sisters, kick things up a notch or two.  Both are fairly familiar arrangements with just enough newness to set them apart from the other versions you already have.<br />The CD ends with the songs I was unfamiliar with.  &quot;Christmas in Killarney&quot; is a fanciful description of the holiday in Ireland, while &quot;Mele Kalikimaka&quot; wishes us a Merry Christmas from Hawaii.  Both songs sound a little like the land they represent and are a fun way to end the CD.<br />The recordings here are old, as shown by the occasional scratchy background noise, especially noticeable on &quot;Adeste Fideles.&quot;  But it doesn't affect my enjoyment one bit.  My only regret is not getting this great CD sooner.
B00000DQSS|5.0|The first Kate Bush album I bought was The Dreaming. I fell in love. And I fell in love with this woman who created this brilliant album, The Dreaming! I then bought Hounds of Love. To my disappointment, Hounds of Love didn't have that oomph of The Dreaming. I head heard that the next best album of Kate's, if not the best, was Hounds of Love. I thought, maybe, like Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville, The Dreaming was the one and only brilliant album from her. Then I decided, I should try to explore more of her albums... I got The Kick Inside and absolutely loved it, it's definitely a fascinating debut. But it lacked that lower range in Kate's voice that I learned to love. It also lacked some complexity as well. THEN, I thought I'd give Never for Ever a chance. To my surprise, I fell in love! This album is perfect! Every song has something very special and different to it. Songs that make you giggle, yet awe in their total beauty. I do prefer The Dreaming, but this album has something that The Dreaming lacked... intense emotion in Kate's voice. Considering my favorite album of all time is Radiohead's Kid A, I really enjoy my music to be very \\"overproduced\\", if you will, and have lots of time and effort put into the music. This album has some very brilliant sounds and textures to it that pull you in and never make you want to escape. To sum up what this album sounds like to someone who hasn't heard it, or Kate Bush even: Very beautiful crazy wide-eyed mad woman screaming with a good melody while doing the shimmy in a very theatrical manner... good visual... now think of what that would sound like.<br />PS. I've heard more of Hounds of Love and do think it's a very good album, indeed. It's just over rated in my opinion.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I, like all of you, have a lot of stress in my life. I'm a freshman in high school, and it isn't easy, plus cross country after school. So I just really like to kick back and try to de-stress myself with some of Norah Jone's music. By the way, yes, I am 14 years old. I just have a hatred for my older sister's rap music and this is my revenge. I prefer either oldies like Elton John or Fleetwood Mac, or women who either play their own instruments or write their own songs, like Jewel (except her new cd, which I hate), Fiona Apple, Sarah MacLachlan, etc. So here's my synopsis of her cd<br />1) Don't Know Why-an obvious mellow hit. Absolutely beautiful 5/5<BR>2) Seven Years- another great one with a mellow tune and one of my favorites. 4.5/5<BR>3) Cold Cold Heart- I don't really like the tune-too different from all of her others. 2.5/5<BR>4) Feelin' the Same Way- A really good summer song with a sunny beat. 4.5/5<BR>5) Come Away With Me- Great. One of my favorites and great for the bath on a rainy day. 5/5<BR>6) Shoot The Moon-Another great summer song. Sounds like track #4, but better.Another one of my favorites 5/5<BR>7) Turn Me On- Kind of dull and boring lyrics. 2/5<BR>8) Lonestar-Different and Great. 4.5/5<BR>9) I've Got To See You Again- A very, very sexy song with great piano music. 5/5<BR>10) Painter Song- Absolutely no tune but ok. 3.5/5<BR>11) One Flight Down- Relaxing with an ok beat 4/5<BR>12) Nightingale- In a strange way, very uplifting. 4/5<BR>13) The Long Day Is Over-Sounds like track #11, but way better. Sssssooooo relaxing. One problem: way too short. One of my favorites. 5/5<BR>14) The Nearness of You-She performed this one as herself in TWO WEEKS NOTICE. Is ok, but like #10 doesn't really have a beat. 3.5/5<br />All in all I really loved it and liked most of the songs. Great for anyone of any age.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I left the cinema crying. And they where definitely NOT tears of joy. I didnt see the origional Matrix in the cine, as I was never too interested in sci-fi, but when I saw it on TV I was amazed. Never before had I seen such an intriguing plot, great characters and most importantly, mind-numbin' gun-totin' special effects. <br />After this, I was first in line to see the sequel and I thought \\"hey, that was pretty good! Not as great as the first, and on its own, probably woulda been crappy... but all the questions raised, all the odd ends, they're all gonna be tied up with just as much special effects to boot in Revoltions! WOOT, MATRIX!\\" after seeing the conclusion, I can only hope for a fourth movie, cos everything that has a beggining, has an end... and this was not it.<br />In exchange for peace, Neo would kill Smith so he could not ruin the machene city as he did the matrix. But to do this, Neo gave his own life. And the machenes retreated. WHY?! That big ol pointy machene made a deal with Neo, but after he has killed Smith, why not just carry on with the attack THAT THEY WERE WINNING and \\"kill 2 birds with one stone\\"? Surely these machenes would have no concept of honour, and could break any promise without regret, something the machenes dont have? And another thing, how is peace possible anyway? As the machenes need the humans in the pods to live, and the Zion humans want to free them, it is not.<br />Really, a predictable ending of the complete destruction of the evil machenes and freedom for the enslaved human race would have been nice. Hell, I would've been happy with the machenes winning, killing the humans in Zion and having all the humans in power pods they needed to survive, with the possibility of the One being reborn, AGAIN, to save the human race in the future. But thats just it, there is no ending. Neo and Trinity die, so does Smith, and the machenes give up their attack on Zion, so we are basicly back where we started! Or are we? Have the humans been freed from their pods? It doesnt say! For absolute freedom, are the people of Zion still going to have to free them? In that case, the ending makes even less sense!<br />All in all, its a great trilogy, and some of the greatest movies of all time, but it is all ruined by this third installment. The movie deserves an ending. We, the fans, deserve some explinations.<br />The Matrix - 10/10<BR>Reloaded - 9/10<BR>Revolutions - 6.5/10<br />Watch this movie, yes, but only for the special effects.<br />\\"...a triumph matched only by its monumental faliure.\\" I think youve got it, right there, Mr.Architect...
0783225903|5.0|This a copied review, slightly edited, but it so succinct that I could not have done a better job.<br />A viewer from Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada posted March 2003<br /><br />Brazil is ultimately a failure on all counts. The plot, such as it exists, centers on a mid-level worker eventually confronting a society crushed underneath a Byzantine system of rules, regulations and paperwork. The world depicted evokes images of such uniquely 20th century works as 1984 and THX-1138; the human soul repressed and minimalized by totalitarianism and the machine of the state. The particular target of this satire, however, is bureaucracy. Unfortunately, while some of the visual design and over the top imagery is intriguing, the movie brings very little new or insightful beyond the premise of bureaucracy runs amok. Indeed after the first few minutes, the message is clear: rules shouldn't obscure humanity. But rather than present any kind of plot to interest the viewer, we're treated to variations of this theme interspersed with sheer boredom. A love story is included as well, complete with dream sequences. These sequences, regrettably, are poorly handled. In a movie with such a surrealistic texture to it's visuals, one would hope for some depth to a dream sequence; messages and themes should be filled with depth and revealed in layers. Instead, here they unfold with all the subtlety of an adolescent dungeons and dragons fantasy. None of this is helped by the fact that the story follows the classic arc of character revelation and disillusionment in laborious starts and (mainly) stops - nothing interesting ever seems to happen. Finally, the movie just isn't funny. And a satire without laughs is one of the most painful of viewing experiences.<br /><br />Taking this together with its lack of insight and slow narrative, Brazil is a remarkably bland experience. Seldom have I watched a bad movie so bereft of any redemptive factors. By the final few minutes one is left not caring at all how the movie ends; just hoping that it will and as soon as possible.the movie ends; just hoping that it will and as soon as possible.
B0000541VS|5.0|You may find \\"Sleepers\\" to be just be a well-acted, provocative legal/psychological drama.  However, beware.  This purportedly true story just might sneak past your guard. <BR> <BR>Robert De Niro is, well, Robert De Niro - always worth watching.  But this is not a Robert De Niro film.  <br />With \\"Sleepers\\" you won't just HEAR about past rapes of boys by slimy prison guards.  \\"Sleepers\\" makes you experience (no male nudity shown, thank you) the Hell's Kitchen of childhood mental and sexual devastation.  (I think that Joseph Perrino, the young \\"Shakes,\\" deserves an Oscar.)  <br />When the movie does a 15 year jump ahead, you are still feeling what they thought they had been able to leave in their past.  Major message of the movie - you don't get past your past by trying to avoid it!!!!  (That's an exclamation point for each \\"boy.\\")  The next scene, when John (Ron Eldard) bumps into scumbag rapist former-guard (Kevin Bacon) in a dive diner, shocked me as much as it shocked John.  John looking at himself in the bathroom mirror may be the most powerful single event in the movie.  <br />A close second is when narrator \\"Shakes\\" gathers up the courage to go visit his father in desperate hopes of telling his own dad what was done to him while in the juvenile prison.  His father is just not on the same page, and Shakes closes back up without telling him.  Wow.  If that scene doesn't move you.......     <br />As an attorney, I particularly liked Dustin Hoffman's defensed attorney come-back (required by awesome character, King Benny).  Hoffman's unassuming cross-examination of the only unmurdered rapist guard is one of my favorite courtroom scenes of any movie.<br />The movie's ending is either a flaw or a masterful choice by director Barry Levinson.  \\"Sleepers\\" takes you from tragic childhood to tragic adulthood, but the very final scene is a flashback to pre-trauma childhood.  Perhaps this ending is an offer of hope that innocence can be regained.  Perhaps it's a thrown gauntlet, to challenge those who need to restart from the beginning - if we can.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|When I first heard the news of Joe's death -- a heart attack ultimately attributed to a congenital defect -- just two days before Christmas last year, I was in too much shock (and denial) to cry. In January, when I read Rolling Stone's loving but brief tribute, I teared up as the reality of his passing sank in. In February, I got choked up during the Grammy Awards as Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, \\"Little Steven\\" Van Zandt and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl sang \\"London Calling,\\" which Joe originally wrote and performed in 1979 as a member of the British punk band the Clash. In March, I damn near lost it during VH1's broadcast of the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame inductions when former Clash bassist Paul Simonon called Joe \\"my big brother.\\" Meanwhile, the news that a posthumous Strummer CD was in the works made me extremely happy.<br />I was finally able to buy a copy of Streetcore -- the third and final album by Joe and his ever-evolving backup band, the Mescaleros -- a couple days ago. Even if I hadn't found myself in a moment of personal turmoil that day (which I won't go into here), my first listen to this album still would have been a very emotional experience. Just hearing Joe's voice, sounding so strong and vital, on the upbeat, insanely catchy opener \\"Coma Girl\\" brought tears to my eyes -- it hit me that Joe would never be making another record. But further spins of the entire album made me realize that, as with any artist's final album, you should just enjoy the music and not torture yourself wondering what more the artist could have given us.<br />Luckily, even with only 10 tracks, there's plenty to enjoy here. \\"Coma Girl\\" ROCKS! It was a great choice for the opening track *and* the lead-off single, and it may be the catchiest thing he's written since his days with the Clash. Joe and company slow it down on \\"Get Down Moses,\\" the closest this disc comes to pure reggae, but Joe sounds as passionate as ever. \\"Long Shadow\\" is a stripped-down folk number originally written for country legend Johnny Cash, but Joe may as well be singing about his own considerable legend: \\"Crawl up the mountain, to reach where the eagles fly / Sure, you can glimpse from the mountain top where the soul of the muse might rise / And if you put it all together, you won't have to look around / You know you cast a long shadow on the ground.\\" \\"Arms Aloft\\" and \\"All in a Day\\" are just fun, catchy arena-size rockers. \\"Midnight Jam,\\" a mostly instrumental track with some spoken voice-overs by Joe (\\"This is London calling!\\"), and the spacey, meditative \\"Ramshackle Day Parade\\" sound like they could have come from the Clash's experimental epic Sandinista! (1980). The ballad \\"Burnin' Streets\\" is a mournful rewrite of the fast-and-furious Clash classic \\"London's Burning\\" (1977). Joe's cover of Bob Marely's folk ballad \\"Redemption Song\\" is moving and surprisingly  beautiful, a tribute to a great man by another great man. Streetcore comes to a close with a sweet, gentle country-style cover of Bobby Charles' \\"Silver and Gold (Before I Grow Too Old);\\" it's hard not to be heartbroken when the disc ends with Joe rasping, \\"Okay, that's a take.\\"<br />Joe had no way of knowing that Streetcore would be his last record, and in that sense, it's closer in spirit to Kirsty MacColl's Tropical Brainstorm (2001) than to George Harrison's Brainwashed (2002) or Warren Zevon's The Wind (2003). All four albums are excellent, but while Zevon and Harrison got a chance to say goodbye to people, reflect on their lives, and ponder the afterlife (with a few moments of levity, such as Harrison's \\"Rocking Chair in Hawaii\\" and Zevon's \\"The Rest of the Night\\"), MacColl and Strummer were both cut down suddenly, and their final discs offer only a quick snapshot of where they were in their lives and what sorts of things they were thinking about. In Strummer's case, he was still (as always) passionate yet very thoughtful, and he apparently died a happy, well-adjusted family man. <br />Kudos to Martin Slattery and Scott Shields, two of Joe's Mescaleros, who produced and arranged this album after his passing, and to Joe's widow, Lucinda Mellor, who helped coordinate the project. (Her brief \\"thank you\\" notes are especially touching.) They worked through a great deal of personal grief to put together this final gift for his fans, and I think it embodies everything for which he would have wanted us to remember him. My heart goes out to his wife and daughters, his friends, and his bandmates. Thank you, Joe, for the music!
0385504209|5.0|I thought this book was awesome!  Hard to put down?  YES.... I finished the book w/in 24 hours.<br />I can't see anyone not liking this book.  I'd have to say the only reason (IMO) one might not like it, is the fact that it could make you question your faith in Catholism.<br />I thought this book was an interesting &amp; fun read, considering I have for a number of years questioned and researched on my own about the council of cicea, priory of sion and symbolisms.
055357342X|1.0|Do this.  Click on the link here at amazon that says something like &quot;Read all #### of the reviews for this book&quot; (Where ### is the number of reviews.)  Then, sort them in order of stars putting the 1 stars first.  Read the 1st 5 or 6 of these reviews.  THEY ARE ALL DEAD ON!<br />I read all of these books and it is quite clear that Martin has no intention of stopping...they just go on and on and on with all of your favorite characters being killed off one by one until, at the end of the 3rd book, there is no one left worth reading about.  <br />Like one of the other reviewers, at one point when both ROB AND LADY STARK ARE KILLED I just gave up...I am not even planning to finish this book--something I have done very few times in my 47 years on this planet.<br />It is clear that Mr. Martin must revel in irritating his readers, I can almost hear him saying &quot;HA HA! that'll show 'em to actually care about my characters!  The world is BRUTAL I tell ya'...here let me hit you over the head a bit.&quot;<br />The Rape, Murder and Mayhem is also unending and tiresome.  Yes it may be realistic--but so what!  Films of hemmeroid surgery are realistic too, I don't think I want to watch one.<br />Save your self.<br />Don't read this one.
B00005JMFO|1.0|I generally don't write movie reviews but I felt compelled to in this case.  Before I decided to see the movie I went online and read several reviews.  Though there were a few dectractors, the overwhelming number of reviews were positive so decided to see it.  <br />I wish I would have listened to the detractors. Don't let the cast fool you, this was definitely one of the worst movies I have every seen.  It is NOT funny, insighful, sentimental, smart, charming, or entertaining.  All the characters are either fools or idiots, the relationships are juvenile, and the jokes typically revolve around being vulgar in inappropriate places--a tired joke that's made more tired by this movie.  I could have forgiven all of it's other failings if it would have just delivered on one dimension, but it didn't.  I wanted to laugh, but it wasn't funny.  I wanted to be stimulated to think, but the storylines were too cliche.  I wanted to like the characters, but they were uninteresting bores or outrageous dolts. <br />If the movie is trying to make a statement about love, it fails miserably.  What passes for love in this movie is little more than a combination of adolescent fantasy and a couple different underdeveloped hollywood cliches about relationships.  It's not a \\"complex\\" portrayal of love as some have said, it's a silly, shallow confusion of love with immature psychological attachment with a little bit of sex mixed in.    It is a truly sad, pathetic film.
B00000DGSN|5.0|This album's a killer from the opening chords of Highway Star to its psychadelic ending with Space Trucking. You can be pretty sure you're going to hear one of the best guitar and organ performances ever(unless you own the album so you already know it). With every song being at least 6 minutes long this album offers so much diversity that you won't get bored of it even after months of listening. The fact that makes this record so outstanding is that every member of the band is  giving his best and the band was as well at its peak at the time of the recording. Ritchie Blackmore delivers an energetic thrust, he has solos 5+ minutes long, but you don't get bored of it like in Led Zeppelin's How The West Was Won(both, by the way, recorded in the summer of '72). He plays with enormous energy even when backing a Jon Lord's showoff. Lots of people tried to copy Lord's stile, but no one has succeeded. Giving a listen to this album will surely reveal why. As for Blackmore, Lord is stunning, his playing makes you get goosebumps,escpecially in songs like Space Trucking. And they both cooperate so well here. Ian Gillan is great, altough he doesn't really stand out so much here(since the album's instrumental part is really the icing on the cake), but he still has a nice voice-guitar duel in Strange Kind Of Woman. Roger Glover is as good as usual, a firm backbone to support all the improvisation. Ian Paice is probably giving his best performance ever and even gets his own solo in The Mule.<BR>I can't understand why he is so underrated. Overall, a very energetic album(but still detailed in song structure), and a very spontaneus performance by all band's members(especially obvious in Lazy). Anyone who I played the album to so far was stunned,and even the most feverish Hip Hop/Techno/whatever fans couldn't deny its quality. <BR>And this is typcal of great music-it stands the test of time. I believe people will still find this album attractive even 100 years after it was recorded. This is a 20th century classic! And as for Deep Purple, I believe they deserve as much recognition as Led Zeppelin. If not agreeing, just (try to) compare How The West Was Won to Made In Japan!
B000002OR4|5.0|John William's efforts to the &quot;Shindler's List&quot; score are wonderful.  Though known for scoring movies like &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, he proves he can also score powerdramas.  His music follows the movie's theme and its scenes exactly.  On the album alone, the listener can feel the characters' trauma in the movie.  Some may cry as a result.  Williams every note is amazing.  His mixture of instruments, mostly orchestral, gives every piece his originality.  Though most tracks follow &quot;Theme From Schindler's List&quot;, they still offer their own theme.  Violin soloist Itzhak Perlman offers his own emotional setting with his amazing talents.  Such genius efforts earned John Williams the Oscar for Best Original Score.  &quot;Shindler's List Soundtrack&quot; is great for those who like orchestral and/or emotional music.  This album will give the added movie experience.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The Strokes have once again successfully recorded a great CD.  When I first purchased the CD I was somewhat afraid to hear what it would be composed of, but upon hearing it for the first time all of my fears subsided.  For &quot;Room on Fire&quot; The Strokes have successfully combined the sounds of their debut CD with a great disco-dance beat style of percussion and bass.  Fab Moretti seems to play more of a role on this cd with completely incredible beats.  Although this CD lacks the melodic basslines from &quot;Is This It&quot; it is more than made up for with incredibly hypnotic melodies in songs like, &quot;12:51&quot; &quot;I Can't Win&quot; &quot;Automatic Stop&quot; and &quot;What Ever Happened&quot;  This CD mimics the sound of their previous CD with the rough and choppy plucking on the guitar, Albert Hammond and Nick Valensi couldn't create a bad melody or solo if they tried.  Nikolai Fraiture may not be as noticeable in this CD as the one before, but he is still there for every note such as the descending bassline in &quot;Reptilia&quot; or just his great sound in &quot;Meet Me In the Bathroom&quot;  And how can I write this without mentioning Julian Casablancas, every note he sings just makes your stomach churn in anticipation for the next note.  All of these things plus marvelously composed melodies make this CD an incredible listen from beginning to end.  So, did The Strokes much anticipated second release fall into the sophomore slump category? Not by a long shot, these musicians are extremely talented and will hopefully keep writing and composing great music for a long time.

630521610X|5.0|This movie did not really scare me but the movie is just so good and brilliant that u have to see this movie over and over and over. Also this movie is quite entertaining. ESPECIALLY THE ENDING. The ending is the best part of scream. Trust me u wont guess who the killer? is in this one.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|...This album is without a doubt one of their best albums and maybe even their best since 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son'. This album contains everything Maiden has done 'til now in one album, plus original songs. It contains short rockin' songs (Wildest Dreams, Rainmaker), long epics (Dance of Death, Paschendale, No More Lies) and some original stuff they've never done before (Face In The Sand and especially Journeyman) and all these songs sound great live too.<br />The production is great, I don't know what you people are complaining about. It's perfect for this album. Plus on this album you can hear 3 guitars, unlike the Brave New World album.<br />It seems like Iron Maiden is the last real heavy metal band. Simply amazing.<br />And about the art cover: yes, it's a strange art cover, I don't know what they were thinking, but what inside is what matters.<br />Shortly this is a great album and even if you won't like it at first listen, it will grow on you, no doubt.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie just plain ROCKS. Its all hi-tech action sci-fi stuff but its awesome. the bad thing is that it is rated R. Dude that just sux yo! besides its not even bad enough to be rated R (id rate it PG-13) oh well, ill try to buy it anyway or just record it when its on tv. so all u 17 and younger ppl i think we agree that the rating is CRAP. ok when we get to watch it...do so cuz this is the best movie
B00004RJSA|5.0|Truly inspired revelations about this music, especially from the wind instruments and the contrabasse. (Do listen on something that will give you bass sound without stint.) The Allegro from the Third is the most exciting music I've heard since Biondi's marvelous assault -- and I use the word advisedly -- on Vivaldi's Four Seasons. If we could hear things played this way in the concert hall, we'd go there more often. Don't miss it. Find it somewhere, somehow and wonder!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan's first studio album in six years, \\"Afterglow,\\" is dedicated to her mother and daughter-fitting for an album that emotionally tackles love and loss.  <BR>  \\"Afterglow\\" encompasses her mother's death and her first child through arousing, melodic tracks.  It's apparent that since her last album, \\"Surfacing,\\" McLachlan's life has evolved into a whirlwind of emotions-she reflects on regret (\\"Fallen\\"), unconditional love (\\"Answer\\") and even calls herself \\"a track wreck waiting to happen.\\"<BR>     \\"When you look up Afterglow in the dictionary, it is defined as `the glow or light that remains once the sun is gone.' You're used to this bright, shiny beautiful glow but the moment sun disappears, all of a sudden you have to readjust everything,\\" says McLachlan on her Web site.<BR>   Although Afterglow doesn't erupt with the similar adventurous flavor of previous albums, it still emits her notable rawness.    <BR>   Like her previous albums, much of \\"Afterglow\\" reads like her own personal diary.  Although vague at times, in the end the poignant lyrics confirm one of the reasons McLachlan has become such a renowned female artist. <BR>   Most importantly, it's the purity of McLachlan's voice that effortlessly glides through each song, giving the lyrics an arousing tug.  <BR>   Particularly on \\"World on Fire,\\" a track reflecting McLachlan's fragile and lonely state during the terrorist attacks.  \\"Something I can do to change what's coming/stay close to me while the sky's falling/I don't wanna be left alone,\\" she sings.<BR>  \\"It's a very transitional moment.  A lot of these songs are about transition...the turning over of the rock, what's underneath, the murky, shadowy uncertainty where everything looks very different,\\" she says.<BR>   \\"Drifting,\\" presumably speaking of a friend's fame overshadowing emptiness, evokes an Enya tone before settling into a less-hushed chorus.  <BR>    McLachlan shines the most when she's stripped down to hergenuine voice and piano on  \\"Answer\\" and \\"Dirty Little Secret.\\"  <BR>   Both blend her gentle voice with passionate keystrokes while revealing McLachlan's need for a loved one and surrendering to the regret from losing one.<BR>    \\"I would not hesitate to tell you all things I never said before/don't tell me it's too late/ `cause I've relied on my illusion to keep me warm at night,\\" she sings on \\"Dirty Little Secret.\\"<BR>   McLachlan may have left the limelight for several years, but \\"Afterglow\\" was well worth the wait.
B0000714BP|5.0|I totally enjoyed this film. It was funny, honest, out of control and off the wall. The actors all did very well with the rolls however Snipes was a bit rough for the roll. It had some meaningful scenes that made good pionts and many scenes that had me roaring out loud. For a fun and enjoyable evening that's not too heavy, watch this movie. Notice is given that if you are unaccepting of diversity this film will most likely offend and confuse you. You may find that you feel guilty for loving this movie and want to lash out, while secretly asking how you would look in pink lace. Just kidding, accept it for what it is and enjoy. Doen't be hating.
B00004U8H4|5.0|This movie cant really be seen as a horror movie or slasher movie.It is a movie which doesnt have alot of gore like the texas chainsaw massacre but leaves it up more to your imagination.The movie delves into the mind of a true sociopath and the modern world in which he lives in.A disturbing image of our materialistic world and the ugliness of human nature.Brilliant acting performances by all the cast especially christian bale.Overall,a great movie which could be enjoyed if you have a true understanding of all the underlying themes in this movie.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED VIEWING!!!
B0000AMRJC|1.0|this is one of the worst movies ever made, pacino is a disgrace to actors.
B000002SE0|5.0|This is a tribute to one of my all-time favorite tenors. He had one of the most beautiful and powerful voice ever for a tenor. I'm so sad.
B00005NGZX|5.0|This is one of the most emotional albums i have ever heard. On this release, converge give you there all. Jacob Bannon has one of the greatest voices i have ever heard. I personally love every song on this release. It takes everything i love about converge and puts it up 10 more notches. this is definatley an album that will be in my cd player for the next ten years and maybe longer. the band is so tight and smooth. they arent as rough around the edges as they were on earlier releases like Petitioning the Empty Sky and When forever comes crashing. i suggest this album to anyone who loves metal music, and maybe if you dont, its worth taking a chance. its that good.
B000003AEB|5.0|I generally dislike hip hop as a whole,but I do like some old school rappers such as snoop.This is without a doubt his best album ever and remains forever a classic.Alot of his classic songs are here and they all have great beats to them.I would recommend picking this cd up to any snoop fan.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This CD came out in 2001, but I blew it off. So many singer/songwriters were coming out, I figured Rufus was just another one of those. <br />Well, I picked up his latest CD &quot;want one&quot; on the urgings of certain people, Instantly it won me over. Wow was I wrong about it being like so many hundreds of the like flooding the market, So I went straight out and bought &quot;posies.&quot;<br />If you like Ben Folds, the high llamas, Sondre Lerche, Elliot Smith, or Jeff Buckley; You'll love this guy.<br />Wainwright strength is his introspective, wry, and heart-wrenching songwriting. His lazy tenor and reminds one of Freddie Mercury, which is a very high compliment, there wasn't a voice like his and I think we can soon say the same about Rufus.<br />I can't even give you a break down rating on individual songs or choose any faves, since there are all perfect. Even his covers of his Dad's &quot;One man guy&quot; and the Beatles &quot;across the universe.&quot;<br />One truly amazing artist. We will here from him for years and years to come.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|With this album The Strokes prove to be the band of this generation. If you liked &quot;Is This It?&quot;, you will also like &quot;Room On Fire.&quot; &quot;What Ever Happened&quot; is the perfect opening. &quot;Reptilia&quot; is fast and furious and proves to be the perfect driving song... The first time I played this song in my car I was going 100 without even realizing it. &quot;Automatic Stop&quot; is great. In the last time through the chorus the guitar starts a little early and when Casablancas yells &quot;wait&quot; it's as if he's talking to Valensi (Or Hammond, not sure which). &quot;12:51&quot; is so catchy... You either love it or hate it and most people love it. &quot;You Talk Way To Much&quot; is another good tune. &quot;Between Love and Hate&quot; has a very good beat and could easily have been the first single. &quot;Meet Me in The Bathroom&quot; is so good. It's catchy with great lyrics. &quot;Under Control&quot;, the first slow strokes song is pure brilliance. &quot;The way it is&quot; sounds like a drum machine but it's Fab Moretti showing how great of a drummer he is. &quot;The End Has No End&quot; has a great chorus. The point of the song is that the resources of music are infinite. &quot;I can't win&quot; is similar to &quot;last night&quot; as it's upbeat and catchy. The last words of the album are &quot;I'll be right back.&quot; Do not hesitate to buy this album. No song on this album would be unworthy of becoming a single.
B00005JMFI|5.0|Will Ferrell shines in his warmest and funniest role. This mostly live action movie cleverly spoofs the classic replacement animation shorts like Island of the Misfit Toys and Rudolph. It is full of laughs and charm from start to finish. The Director does an outstanding job and shows great taste in creating entertainment for all ages. An instant Christmas classic. Easily one of the best comedies I have ever seen!
B00005JMFR|5.0|This last installment of the matrix trilogy is nothing short of pure genius and shows why this trilogy is one of the most powerful epics of the modern age.It is without a doubt one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films.The jaw dropping visual effects and adrenaline charged battle scenes are way beyond anything seen in the first two films.Awesome war scenes,an incredible soundtrack and legendary fight scenes is what this movie brings.Not to mention that the movie is extremely thought provoking because it beautifully expresses our hopes,dreams,fears and other ideas such as life and death.The movie has gotten alot of unfair criticism by ignorant reviewers who are making petty complaints.The main complaints are that the acting wasnt good,not enough fight scenes in the matrix and no final resolution in the movie.First,the acting may not have been superb,but it was good enough.Secondly,people need to get over this complaint because there were enough fight scenes in the matrix done in the previous movies and this was not the main premise of revolutions.Thirdly,were people actually expecting a complete and final victory?Outright victories never happen in real wars because there are too many other variables to take into account such as death and other lingering issues.Christ came to save us and create a new utopian world,but yet we are still enslaved by our natures and the world has become more of a hell than its ever been.Where was the final resolution in his coming?To conclude,alot of people simply did not understand the plot,let alone the philosophy behind it.There is a cultural backlash against this movie because it is being well received by the general public.I suspect that people just had too many expectations for this movie and spent all of their time looking for its faults.The matrix revolutions isnt a perfect movie,but neither were its predecessors or any movie for that matter.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I have had this CD for a while, but I didn't write a review simply because I really couldn't find the right words to describe it. <br />I was so strongly taken in by Damien's' music that I literally sat still doing absolutely nothing for the entire length of the CD, including the stray songs way after the initial songs were over.<BR>When I play this CD it is like Damien is right in my living room, just playing and hanging out. It is that intimate.<br />Damien's voice is, in a word, captivating! Once his voice has hold of you, along comes the angelic whispers of Lisa Hannigan; now there is no escape. Most of the instruments were played by Damien as well as the art work, proving that he is multitalented, not just one of many &quot;singer/songwriters&quot; out today.<br />It seems the genre is getting flooded much like what happened to the &quot;Seattle scene.&quot; Hopefully not destroying it like grunge was killed by commercialism.<br />Damien has taken up the cross left behind by Jeff Buckely. <br />Favorite songs are:<br />delicate<BR>Volcano<BR>the blower's daughter<BR>cannonball<BR>older chests<BR>cheers darlin'<BR>i remember<br />But make no mistake, there is not one bad track on here.<br />a true rival for best of 2003
B00008DDSC|1.0|Most people are scared to say this movie is wrong, antisocial, or wicked. Not because they don't believe it to be true, but because they are AFRAID. Afraid of being mocked, made fun of, called prudish, judgmental, or hypocritical. And  so the censorship by the loud and indignant a-moralists rules the day.<br />Well I have to ask: If someone enjoys being a victim, is it ok to be a victim then? Is it a good thing? Or is the victim to be pitied?<br />This film doesn't care. This movie says that any kind of relationship is a good relationship if both partners are willing. Regardless of whether or not that relationship is demeaning, based on the desire to do harm, or to be hurt. What's even more surprising than this movies decidedly anti-social, immoral stance is that almost no one reviewing this film has the guts to say that it is wrong. Most of the people who loved this movie and justify the situations in it stoop to mocking anyone who makes a moral judgment. There's a valid form of argument! Even people who hated this movie are afraid of appearing to be prudes, so they have to gush about the fine acting. Well, somewhere along the line the quality of the acting is colored by the choice of the role. And for that, Maggie and James each get an &quot;F&quot; for acting. (Does the Third Reich get a 0 star review because of its Evil, or do we give it 2 stars for efficient execution during its first hour? I give it a 0. A nothing. A null.)<br />So go ahead and decry this review as &quot;judgmental&quot;. To judge actions or situations as right or wrong is not &quot;judgmentalism&quot;. It is morality. Handing down sentences and punishment to people over whom one has no authority is judgmentalism. I wish nothing but the best for the people involved in this movie, and hope they will find some kind of healing and life to wake up their dead souls.
B000023VR6|5.0|I got this CD back in 2000 and it still kicks ass. I listen to it all the time and the songs never get old. Dre shows his rap as well as production talents in one of his best CDs of all time. This is a &quot;must have&quot; for any collection and I highly reccomend it to everyone.
B00005AQE8|5.0|&quot;All Eyez On Me&quot; Is by far, Hands down the best Pac album ever.<BR>With it's bangin' beats to it's heart touchin' lyrics, This Album is a must 4 ANY TRUE HIPHOP FAN!

B0000CABBW|5.0|Its wonderful how many people saw and reviewed this movie, this is by far the best film for the year of 2003! I even remember the story of paikea, we'd have it told to us in elementary school from the kupuna's (The Elderly). Its awesome that a movie was made in its honor! It is always nice to educate the rest of the world about one culture and its beliefs! Keisha made a great paikea, I couldnt imagine anyone else pulling it off. This is definately a movie to own!!
B000070IXT|3.0|Resident Evil undoubtedly works far better on the small screen than it did at the cinema. There is no way any director (no matter how experienced) can bring a video game to life without sacrificing art in the process. Anderson has been here before with Mortal Kombat but injected into both movies enough competency and style to make them respectable in their own right.<br />With Resident Evil he has given us a decent story with a touch of complication and a fair amount of suspense. My main gripe is the fact that the movie looks far too slick to be as truly disturbing as the grainy and filthy Zombie movies of the '70s. Plus the violence isn't all that graphic but there is still plenty of fun to be had in watching a bunch of office workers turn into the living dead and it's scary how cheaply their lives are considered by the Umbrella Corp. they work for. I'm certainly not going to work in an office for a company like that if that's what they're going to do to me.<br />The characters are thin but not entirely one-dimensional. You do end up siding with some of them and feel urgency in their futile escape from the underground skyscraper (shouldn't that be 'Groundscraper' then?). Milla Jovovich is cuter here than she was in Fifth Element or Zoolander but Michelle Rodriguez just plain annoys me. All I've ever seen her play is a moody Latino who frowns all the time. It's time for here to try and expand her range a bit and I wish someone else played her character.<br />Video games will never make for classic movies. They can be mind-numbingly terrible (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon) or competent, such as this. Just turn a blind eye to the really, really bad FX at the end when a CGI monster goes on the rampage. My old Commodore 64 was capable of better graphics.<br />The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and a choice of Dolby 5.1 or DTS 5.1 soundtracks which sound great but, as a result, also serve to highlight he meaningless and clich&eacute;d Marco Beltrami/Marylin Manson 'score'.son 'score'.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|This cd is just okay. I couldn't believe it! I expected a lot better from them. I liked the cd alright but I found it a bit dissappointed. Don't get me wrong it's just that I believe that it could be better. (sigh) Why is a singer so great doing a cd this average?
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I'm so glad Warner wised up and re-released this in OAR. It truly is the best Vacation movie and this DVD is miles better than my crappy old pan and scan VHS copy.<br />With a strong John Hughes script, an ace comic performance from Chase and onslaught of jokes and quotable dialogue this is not only best of the &quot;Vacation&quot; series but one of THE Xmas movies. There certain movies that Xmas cannot be without (Scrooged, Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Gremlins are the others) and this is one of them. Xmas Vacaction is definitely the new 'It's A Wonderful Life'.<br />This time the Griswolds are staying at home in the snowy suburbs of Chicago and are preparing for the 'best Xmas ever' as Clark has been dreaming of a 'good ol' fashioned family Xmas all his life'. But it's not that simple. The in-laws hate each other, brother and sister are forced to sleep together, there's no Xmas bonus (not a good one anyway) and Hillbilly cousin Eddie (a classic performance from Randy Quaid) imposes in an impromptu 'surprise' visit. It seems like a disaster waiting to happen but there is no waiting; Just disaster, as everything that can go wrong...does. And them some. But the ever-delusional Chase will not let any little mishaps sway his optimism.<br />The suburban-American Xmas atmosphere is captured perfectly and snow covered scenery gives the impression of a very cosy Xmas. Watch this film during advent, I guarantee it will be to your festive benefit.<br />The new DVD has an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 and has a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack. It's definitely one to get for this time of year.
0792844890|1.0|I cant even rate this movie its so horrible. The worst spoof in history. I watched this movie at my friends house cause this other kid brought it over. I was about to hurl halfway through because it was so pathetic. NOTHING IN THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS FUNNY. We made fun of the kid that brought it over and told him he was gay. NEVER EVER SEE THIS MOVIE.
B00006F7S4|4.0|I was never a fan of Beck's previous music, but I gave this album a chance and I really like it.  It should be apparent by now what to expect more or less from this CD.. gloomy acoustic music.  (although it's not just Beck and his guitar.. other instruments are used)<br />I think this is a solid album and anybody in the mood for sad acoustic songs should give it a chance.<br />Some people say Sea Change drags on too long and is too depressing.  I don't feel the same way about that.  I think Beck has the ability to make very beautiful music even if it is sad..  If you want happy uplifting music, this isn't the place to look, so don't expect it.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|First of all... I really enjoyed this dvd. The special features, tour diary, and the actual show.. GREAT stuff!! I think they mixed the arrangement of the songs up enough to warrant buying this dvd/cd. The video quality is AMAZING and the different really give a great watching and listening experience.  Unfortunately.. it's a bit too post-produced.  Espescially apparent on the first line of \\"Yellow,\\" there's a vocal overdub which makes me wonder how \\"live\\" this show really is. Some other parts make me wonder what's live and what's not, for example many of the sounds straight from the album, like the swell sound on the verses of \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and strings on Politik and others. <br />So... yes buy this dvd/cd, it's GREAT entertainment. I Just wish we could hear the REAL coldplay live.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Taking into consideration the fact that ColdPlay is one of the greatest bands out there, they are even better live. They bring that energetic, mellow feel back to music that makes it enjoyable to hear. Live 2003 just shows you how enthusiasitc everyone else is about their music, along with the band's enthusisasm towards their fans. The Yawner review is wrong, U2 is irish, ColdPlay is british, and if they were copying them, they do a real good job. Its the same as the CD because their songs are the same on the CD, nothings boring about them.....if you want to hear them differently, play the songs yourself.....cranky reviewer is wrong too.....Cold Play rules....everyone else now adays doesn't compare.
B00003CXB4|5.0|One thing we can always count on with a Disney film...there is something for the kiddies and something for the adults that get carried along into the theater with them.  This film is no exception. Most of the humor hit me right in my funny bone and the site gags raised giggles, smiles and pointing fingers from my little ones.  <br />I enjoyed the usual Disney plot:  Cute side characters, bouncy music with sweet lyrics and a life-affirming tale about coming of age in this Big Wide World of Wonders.  The art was beautiful with special note to the computer generated stampede scene which was simply breath-taking on the wide-screen.<br />Slide this video into your VCR and sit back with your kids and a big bowl of popcorn to pass around and enjoy!
B00005JM4Z|5.0|This film was awesome, one defo for the thrill seekers.  Just sit back and enjoy the thrill of the race!  Excellent visuals and special effects and I ain't just talking about those fast cars either, I mean the hot fast men too.  Paul Walker is to die for a total babe-magnet - sex on a stick!! mmmmmmmmmmmm! He is a very talented actor and oozes charisma and charm.  He keeps your eyes glued to the screen and your bott firmly on yer seat. Tyrese's character Roman, is a lovable rogue whose boyish charm and sexy smile leave you wanting more. It also had an element of playground humour between Brian (Paul) and Roman (Tyrese), which was comical at times, this also made it fun to watch.  A definite MUST SEE!!!!!!!!
B00005JKHN|2.0|I remember seeing this film in the theater, not sure what year.  It was the habit of Disney to show their films in rotation, one year Sleeping Beauty, another Bambi, another Snow White, Fantasia, Alice In Wonderland, and so on.  This was before the age of VCR's.  When I saw it I was very small.  Maleficent, the evil witch that put a curse on Aurora, frightened me, as she did when she became the gigantic fire-breathing dragon.  I had a few nightmares about this film.<br />I would caution parents with very small children to watch the tape first without the child present to see if these images are appropriate for their child.  At times, Disney was a bit too over-the-top in the earlier classic cartoons when it came to violence and death and I can recall a few other films he made where the images were too much for me to understand and frightened me instead.  I remembering being very upset when Bambi's mother was shot dead, crying through a good portion of the rest of the film. When I saw Snow White's stepmother turn into the wicked old hag I could no longer look at the screen and wanted to leave the theater.<br />Disney's company was even responsible for a horrible cartoon called \\"Hitler's Children\\" that was made during WWII, I believe as propaganda.  (I was able to view this cartoon recently and was appalled at the images and language!)  So, even though these old cartoon films are called \\"classics\\" parents should take the time to view them before their children do and spare their children some unhappy moments.  I wish my parent had had the same option.<br />The rest of the film tells a good story and the art is visually interesting despite being so old.  I give this film 2 1/2 stars
B000069HZP|5.0|I knew this movie had to be great before I even watched it because it is made by an excellent director and it is played by at least two wonderful actors.Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are brothers (lol) and Douglas plays the role of an unhappy businessman, anyways the movie starts with Douglas's birthday and it's then when he receives a mysterious present from his brother - so what he gets is a enrollement in CRS (Consumer Recreation Services) - a company which creates real life games for each individual.But as the game starts Douglas has every reason to get concerned about his wealth and his life as well.<BR>A nail-bitting movie. <br />Please watch it or own it so you can play &quot;The Game&quot; to your guests. It's a great movie.
B00005JLK1|2.0|True statements:<br />1. No one forced me to watch this film.<br />2. Ghosts like wearing 40's outfits and smoking cigarettes with long cigarette holders.<br />3. Ghosts like making new ghosts cause they're very sociable.<br />4. Ghosts are neatnicks. They may fill up a swimming pool with blood but are always quick and polite to completely clean up their messes afterwards with nary a drop of blood in site. <br />5. Ghosts stare at you.<br />6. A lot.<br />7. Ghosts are considerate hosts. If they kill someone they wait until that person is alone so their screams of terror will not bother the other &quot;guests&quot;.<br />8. This film was silly.
0783225482|4.0|Meryl Streep plays Madeline Ashton, an actress who is obsessed with keeping herself looking young and beautiful. Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn), is a plain looking author with a brilliant surgeon, Dr. Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis), for a fiance. Madeline and Helen have hated each other for years, but things become even worse when Madeline steals Ernest from Helen and they get married. Years later, Madeline is even more obsessed with keeping her youth, willing to do ANYTHING to keep from aging physically. On the other hand, Helen is obsessed to get revenge on Madeline for stealing her fiance. But it seems that there is one thing in common between the two rivals, in that both seem to know the same woman, Lisle Von Rhoman (Isabella Rossellini). Lisle, who has the power to give the two woman something the world has been searching for centuries... the secret of youth. But Madeline and Helen will learn that the 'secret of youth' has a high price, and that their 'lives' will never be the same again.<br />As the title of my review says, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; is a very dark yet hilariously funny movie. Directed by genius Robert Zemeckis (director of the Back to the Future trilogy, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Contact&quot;, and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;), he gives the movie such an underlying sense of psychological suspense that it's really hard what category to put this movie under. <br />Is it a comedy?: Yes, &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; could be called a comedy. But it has a very twisted sort of humor, you'll have to be someone who enjoys all forms of comedy to really enjoy and understand the humor. There is both laugh-out-loud slapstick humor, then there's the dry type of humor which takes a few seconds to really getting you chuckling. But more than anything, the satire and irony of the story is so well imbedded into the plot that there's really no specific part you can pinpoint as the funniest part of the movie. When the movie finished, my parents andI stopped the movie, there was a brief pause, THEN we started howling with laughter! It's the truth, really! No, it wasn't because it was so awful or stupid (some parts were) but because it's not until AFTER the movie that the satire of the film really hits you.  <br />Is it horror?: Yes, there are some parts which you could describe the movie as being under the horror genre. There's the whole 'haunted, creepy, gothic mansion' scene, and one of the themes of the movie is about 'death'.<br />Is it a drama?: Strangely enough, there is a sense of drama in the story. The story touches upon the topics of death and the dream of wanting to 'live forever and retain your youth'. This is very well expressed through the main actresses and actor of the movie. I mean, what will your choice been when given a chance to be able to live forever? The suspense towards the end when one of the characters must decide is well executed.<br />But more than anything, it's not just the story of the movie that really gets you, it's the fact that the actors do such an outstanding job with their characters. Meryl Streep is simply fantastic and she handles the dark side of her character very well. Goldie Hawn is also fantastic, can you imagine her as a fat, depressed, and ugly woman? Well, watch this movie to see her handle the role with ease. And Bruce Willis, you would never imagine seeing him in this kind of movie, but he is just GREAT! He plays the character plagued by two very 'obsessed' woman very well, and he's 'kind of' the 'hero' of the film.<br />As others have also mentioned, the effects of the movie are brilliantly put to the screen. I can't give away much of the story, but check out how they accomplish getting Meryl Streep's character to 'get up and about' after being pushed a flight of stairs and having her neck broken. Weird...<br />Anyway, though a brilliant film, I strongly suggest that people would borrow before getting this movie to add to their collection. Some people might not be able to appreciate or understand the movie enough to enjoy it's twisted look at 'life after death'.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I recently read, once again, the original J.R.R. Tolkien triology of Lord of the Rings and was reminded of the &quot;creative&quot; ways in which the director, Peter Jackson, made a few changes such as having a character say something or do something that someone else had said or done in the books, dropped scenes, and added scenes that never even existed in the books. There is a rumor going around that some day he will explain these changes to angry fans of the original books.  If this is true it will be interesting to hear what he has to say.<br />In the meantime...<br />I said all the above first to get it out of the way.  When I went to see the first movie I was aware of the differences between the movie and original story but I didn't care...this movie was great!  Everything good and beautiful were in place: great locations, top-notch acting, set designs and costumes,it was beautifully filmed, CGI done exceptionally well, beautifully written and directed...this film just rocked!  I was carried along with a story of such breadth and height by all these things and couldn't wait to see the next installment.  It did not disappoint me! <br />LOR: TTT has once again captured me up in the fine art of story-telling and the best of the best in making a film right.  At my first full look at Gollum I sat there with my mouth open, amazed they were able to capture the essence of the creature so well.  (I read the books in my early teens and I remember imagining Gollum just this way!)  Once again, I cared deeply for the characters.  Once again I could not find fault with any one actor's portrayal, even the bit parts were made interesting by the superb acting.  In this film, as in the first, obviously everyone involved was on top of their game. Applause.  <br />Now to the DVD.  I was very disappointed that there were some elements on the DVD I could not access unless I got online and registered.  There was no mention of this anywhere on the DVD itself, that I would need to register and give away, yet AGAIN, my personal information to a company whose only interest is selling me more of their products and selling my e-mail/snail mail addresses to others...GEESH!  So, because I have not registered the product online, (with my very own personal registration code that came with the DVD), I cannot access some of the features on the DVD that I PAID FOR!!!  Bah!!!<br />The other features included on the DVD consist mostly of &quot;The Making Of...&quot; type shorts which are a mix of interesting tidbits for the LORphiles and boring talk about how cleverly they went about all things LOR:TTT.<br />One more month before LOR: Return of the King!
B000006TRV|5.0|people, don't argue. this record is a masterpiece. it's a masterpiece only if u know what does it really talk about. if its pink floyd's best or not, that's a different subject. and for the people who listen to todays crap like r&amp;b( yuck) and that sort of stupid music, well stick to the things you hear and don't dare to talk about pink floyd, it's a blasphemy. it's a matter of IQ mostly, so i propose to take david gilmour and any pop star teen idiot that you like and put them to play guitar, or give jennifer hlopez a guitar. she'll most probably think it's a new type of microphone.<br />get real people, bands like pf, yes, camel, kansas and so on are for the few people that like real music. you wanna listen to lopez or britney, then feel free, i wouldn't want any fan of that kind listening to what i hear. so keep away.<br />as far as the album is concerned, don't buy it unless you really like floyd, concept albums, and have an IQ average that allows you to UNDERSTAND and COMPREHEND, two things lost in our days.
076790592X|3.0|I am an 8th grader, and I chose to read this book for a book report because I had heard such wonderful things about it. I would recommend this book for certain people only.  While Morrie's views may be helpful to some, I truly believe that this book is overrated.  I had heard that this book was life changing, and for me this was certainly not the case.  For extremely materialistic people, this book may change some values, but for an average person, the book won't tell anything they don't already know.  I was disappointed when it most certainly did not live up to the expectations I had in my mind.    <BR>   In my opinion, Tuesdays With Morrie was a good story that was not as well written as it should have been. While Morrie does have good messages to share with readers, these are things that most people are usually conscious of, and only extremely materialistic people may need such reminders.  The writing itself did not do justice to the meaningful story that could have been portrayed.  <br />   However, I did enjoy the story to some extent, and because it is a short book, it is worth reading.  I think that some people may need this book as a small reminder of what is really important in life.  I also appreciate the fact that Mitch Albom shared Morrie's inspirational views with the world, and the idea behind this book is important and meaningful.<BR>     Just the same, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.  Overall, Tuesdays With Morrie was a hardly above average book that I, unfortunately,found very hard to enjoy thoroughly.
6303269826|3.0|Liked the movie Tombstone better...Kurt Russel plays <BR>Wyatt Earp..but still it's not quite right in some parts.<BR>For example one scene where he confronts a group of bad <BR>men on the street...he pulls his gun and points it at the<BR>head of the leader and makes a threat to blow his head off<BR>if they don't all back off!<BR>..hogwash!!! Bat Masterson said Wyatt<BR>never pulled his gun unless there was no other course of<BR>action he could take..in this situation Wyatt would (and<BR>often did) grab the bad guy's right hand with his left <BR>hand (preventing him from drawing his gun) and then with<BR>his other hand draw his pistol and use the barrel like a<BR>night stick hitting the guy across the forehead.<BR>Next he would grab the stunned man by the ear and drag <BR>him off to jail.

B00004TWZF|4.0|After watching the movie, I looked at the clock and was surprised that I'd spent 3 hours of my life watching one movie comprised mainly of underwater scenes and European coastlines, and it was all so pretty. Its a pity I've only heard of this movie recently and can only watch it on DVD... I wish now that I had been able to watch it on the big screen because I think it would've been a breathtaking experience to watch this in a good cinema with good sound system. <br />One can't help but notice the stark contrast between the lives of Jacques and Johanna. Jacques is the deep-sea diver who grew up on Mediterranean shores living a slow-paced lifestyle. He is not tied down by material possessions, places (he travels around a lot) and women(well, perhaps it was just Rosanna he didn't want to be tied down to). The only thing that really matters to him in life is the sea and diving. Johanna is a New Yorker and works for the insurance company. Her character is somewhat shallow, constantly whining, shrieking, crying, whimsical, unstable (emotionally and mentally)...etc. <br />And this is one of the main problems I have with this movie - the obvious incompatibility of the 2 lovebirds, who make up the other main focus of this movie. Jacques somehow knew all along in his heart that their relationship was going to be nothing more than a short-term fling... but Johanna with her child-like shrieking and demanding ways... I don't know... just felt like the movie could have done much better to use a female lead character with more depth and maturity. Rosanna Arquette is a good actress, she has her funny moments and can be really endearing in the right movie, but certainly not in this one.<br />Another problem I had with this movie is the musical score. The worst thing about it wasn't so much that it sounded 80s and very outdated, but that it often sounded laughingly like some background music from a soft porn scene in some lousy old C-grade movie. It ruins the viewing experience, especially during some of the beautiful underwater scenes - complete silence would still be better than having this music playing in the background.<br />Still, this is a memorable movie. The storyline is very simple, and some parts of it remind me of Free Willy. The backdrop/scenery on which this drama is played out offers us a beautiful perspective of life along the coasts of the Mediterranean. This is a unique movie that shows us not only the beauty and tranquility of the sea through the eyes of the divers, but also tells us that we don't need to chase the dollar and have lots of material possessions to be happy. <br />The length of the movie is irrelevant. If you love the sea, dolphins and/or enjoy diving, then this is definitely the movie for you.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Theatrical review<br />As stated above, \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is an exhilarating conclusion to this brilliant, seminal and cinematically beautiful intelligent series!  Few cinematic trilogies can even compare to the experience that is \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" and its two predecessors in its breadth of entertainment on all levels, whether one is talking about its action sequences or the extraordinarily intelligent script that is epic in its nature and scope.<br />All involved, from the series creators the Wachowski brothers to every actor and actress in the film deserve such high praise for their efforts in creating these exceptional films.  From the trials and tribulations in their training for the high speed karate moves to Carrie-Ann Moss even breaking her leg, all of their efforts shine through brilliantly on the silver screen.  As was the case with the first two films, the score for \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" seamlessly enhances every scene in the film and what I found to be a move of genius, the movies creators didn't just extend what they used in \\"The Matrix Reloaded,\\" but they used what seamed to be an all new score for this film.<br />The Premise:<br />As \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" concluded we learned that Neo's seemingly super powers no longer ended when he left the Matrix but he is now in a coma.  The sentinels are continuing to bore down on Zion and Morpheus and Trinity learn that Neo, while not being plugged into the Matrix, is actually in the Matrix, but not where they might expect him to be...<br />What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films where the action sequence with the sentinels getting into Zion in an epic battle and Neo and Trinity's efforts to reach the machine capital will have you, the lucky moviegoer, on the edge of your seat the whole way, hoping and praying that everybody will make it.<br />I highly recommend not only \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" but the entire extraordinary series as you will soon find yourself compelled to \\"enter the Matrix...\\"  {ssintrepid}
B00003CXTF|1.0|Look, unless you're a die-hard war movie freak, or a twisted teenager with a fascination for gore, you'll probably find it hard to take this movie.  Critics said this movie was a throwback to the old war movies of the 40's...get real.  Back then people knew how to make an intriguing movie without showing skin and blowing people to bits on camera.  This movie was just Hollywood's attempt to use a significant historical event to recapture Titanic's blockbuster success.  I don't want to pay money to hear &quot;bang bang bang&quot; for an hour and see flying body parts and people relentlessly suffering and dying.  Yes, war happens and it's horrible and gruesome...do I want to pay $10 to watch it?  Heck no.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|In a time when there are so many brilliant silver screen masterpieces hitting the theaters and DVD racks, the Matrix series stands out among the top series of movies as one of the finest.  As seminal as &quot;The Matrix&quot; was in movie making, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; takes that innovation and sets a much higher mark in movie making originality as it only the second in the series but truthfully just the first half of the brilliant conclusion to the story set up in &quot;The Matrix.&quot;<br />Few movies or series of movies entertain on multiple levels such as The Matrix series and particularly &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; does; between the action and the undeniably brilliant script that is enlightening yet leaves enough open to question that you find you must see the third movie &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; to get to the finale of this essential and cinematically brilliant movie going experience.<br />Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith and all of the other actors all deserve any and all accolades and awards they receive for their respective roles in this astonishing film.<br />The Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry both have with this series proven what extraordinary creators they can be in the film industry.  From the intelligent script to the astonishing action sequences, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; entertains on every level!  The score for the film is &quot;spot on&quot; perfect for every scene. <br />The Premise:<br />How can you top a line such as Morpheus asking Link where Neo is and he replies that &quot;He's doing his Super Man thing?&quot;  <br />After the exciting conclusion to &quot;The Matrix&quot; - Xyon is now threatened with one sentinel per man; woman and child, totaling 250k, digging their way towards it and those in power are trying to find a way to stop them!  Meanwhile, Morpheus believes that the answer is not within the real world but with Neo and within the Matrix.<br />Neo now finds that he must seek out the Oracle once again to hopefully get some of the answers to his questions but he only finds more questions and he soon finds that Agent Smith is not dead and he has some very &quot;creative&quot; new talents.  Morpheus, Trinity and Neo learn that they must find the key maker in order to get to some of their answers but they must go through some of the most exciting action sequences and some extraordinary characters to get to them...<br />If you're looking for one of the most enjoyable thrill rides and intellectually challenging scripts to ever be put to film, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is definitely for you!  I highly recommend not only this film but the first one and the last one as well.  Few, if any, movies entertain on so many levels as does the Matrix series.  This DVD most certainly deserves a hallowed spot on the DVD rack!<br />Special Features:<br />- Preload - Get Behind the Scenes<BR>- The Matrix Unfolds - A Look at The Matrix Phenomenon<BR>- The Freeway Chase - How They did it<BR>- Get Me an Exit - Inspired Design and Editing<BR>- Enter the Matrix - Making the Game<BR>- What is The Animatrix?<BR>- The MTV Movie Awards Reloaded<br />While &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; answers some of the questions that arose during &quot;The Matrix,&quot; it only serves to raise more questions that can only be answered in &quot;The Matrix Revolutions!&quot;  {ssintrepid}
B00005Y6YB|1.0|I saw the original Lonesome Dove series on TV and fortunalely was able to tape it. After buying a DVD player I bought the DVD because of the supposedly better picture quality and no commercials.<br />Was I ever dissapointed. Parts of the program were edited out as the story went along. The unforgiveable sin was the abrupt ending of the story leaving out atleast a third of the story and the conclusion.<br />I want my money back.<br />Bob Glover
B00005JMFR|2.0|I really enjoyed the first Matrix movie.  It was fresh, novel, unique, and not too sure of itself.<br />The second movie was annoying with it's philisophical babble, but the action sequences and fighting was awesome.  (It's saving graces, really.)  It took itself too seriously, and unfortunatly it tried too hard.<br />This third movie is garbage.  Most of the movie I was waiting for _anything_ interesting to happen.  I didn't feel compelled by any of the emotional/plot building scenes.  There is very little in the way of fighting scenes.  One good aspect is the dock fight scene, which is cool.  (I'm always a fan of large shot mass warfare scenes.)  Other than that the way it all pans out is kind of cryptic, lame, and all too perfect.  Most of the action is done with odd flashing lighting making it hard to follow so it ends up looking like chaotic trash.<br />The worst part is they left it wide open for even more crappy sequels.
B0000C8AV2|5.0|&quot;Oh Mercy&quot; without a doubt was Bob Dylan's best album of the 80s and would make it on my top ten Dylan albums of all time list. The 80s was an awful time for Bob Dylan with &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; and &quot;Infidels&quot; being the only albums worth mentioning from that period. &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; shows us a very thoughtful and even bitter Bob Dylan like in &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; and &quot;Time Out Of Mind.&quot; The music is very back-to-the-basics but not in the traditional sense of Bob Dylan's music. My favorite songs are: &quot;Political World&quot;, &quot;Everything is Broken&quot;, &quot;The Man In The Long Black Coat&quot;, &quot;Most Of The Time&quot;, &quot;What Good Am I?&quot;, and &quot;Shooting Star.&quot; <br />&quot;Oh Mercy&quot; is essential to any Bob Dylan collection.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|This is a total different score from K-19 Widowmaker.<br />Pirates is a stunning combination of all good parts from The Rock and Gladiator(2000).<br />Klaus brought in what he knew from his collaberation and work with Hans Zimmer in Gladiator. You can even recognize the bee-hive swarm-like beat from The Battle and Barbarian Horde tracks. I see no problem in compiling similar work to make a score just as powerful and alive.<br />The fast pace percussion is a similar beat to Hummel Gets the Rockets and Rock House Jail in The Rock. Very noticeable in track 07 - Barbossa is Hungry. This is heavily influenced by the overproduction of Hans Zimmer. 'Overproduced' is properly credited especially within the performance and composition of this score.<br />The true theme of this film lies in The Medallion Calls track 02.<br />An excellent piece that seperates itself from all other works and scores.<br />An awesome masterpiece that Klaus Badelt delievers.
B00005B0PU|5.0|O.K., nothing terribly witty or mindbendingly profound here. The others have said what had to be said. Virtually every track will have you marveling at the Zombies ability to play WITH music. Listening to this CD refreshed memories of thought and feeling that I thought were forever lost. &quot;Brief Candles,&quot; &quot;Smokey Day&quot;, and &quot;Walking in the Sun&quot; will renew your innocence... and, YES, that feeling just might provoke a tear or two. One of the top 5 albums of all time? It just might be. Just close your eyes and listen.
B00005JMFR|2.0|The first installment of the Matrix changed the way films will be shot forever, containing action scenes unlike any other, but what really made it special was the captivating storyline and character interaction.  Sadly, this is the area where Revolutions falls short.  The second film hinted at so many sub-plots that I was satisfied to wait for Revolutions to have its mysteries revealed, and never considered complaining about Reloaded as others had done. What was revealed was a thin storyline once stripped of the visual images, and a movie devoid of character interaction except for almost laughable bursts of meaningless dialogue(I have many examples, but why bother).  The problem for me is that I loved this story, and it characters, and I felt that I was on the verge of seeing something wonderful, moving, and unforgetable.  I didn't, and it wasn't even close.  Speculating on what this or that aspect may mean in the \\"cosmic\\" scheme of things is pointless, as it expresses the visions of the viewer more than what was actually presented. I have my own theories of what the writers may have had in mind like everyone else, but they are just not importantenough to mention.  I respectfully submit that many conclusions can be drawn but no hard conclusions are possible because the film is just too \\"all over the place\\" to satisfy on that level.  See it, because if you are a fan of the series you need to, and see if you think I am right.  I am betting you will, and I am very sorry.
B000000W5H|5.0|For many Stones fans, including yours truly, this is where the truly great Stones period. Some migtht argue that &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot; marked the end, and most would argue it was &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot;. But &quot;It's Only Rock 'N' Roll&quot; was the last to feature truly original Stones - sounding music before succumbing to the fever of disco and reggae.<br />If you're a hits - hungry Stones fan, you'll probably purchase this release for its title track. But there are a lot of other great numbers, including a scorching cover of &quot;Ain't Too Proud To Beg&quot;, the acoustic treasure &quot;Til The Next Goodbye&quot;, and Mick Taylor's magnum opus &quot;Time Waits For No One&quot;. The latter track features a genuine 3 - minute guitar solo played with ease and skill by Taylor. &quot;Luxury&quot; is a fusion of reggae, ska and rock that comes out on top as a successful foray into newly discovered regions. Similarly, &quot;Fingerprint File&quot; has the Stones jumping aboard the funk wagon, complete with funky bass lines and amazing keyboard work by Billy Preston.<br />This album is not a true masterpiece like &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; or even an imitation of one like &quot;Goat's Head Soup&quot;, but &quot;It's Only Rock 'N' Roll&quot; is definitely more than average Stones material and is also the last album featuring the Stones performing true Stones music before jumping aboard the bandwagon of disco, funk and reggae.
0553062182|3.0|Apart from being a very spiritual person (VSP), I'm also a highly sensitive person (HSP). I am quickly overwhelmed by noise and confusion, and am easily shocked and offended by the insensitivity of the other 80% of the population. I am easily over-aroused by stimuli, and suffer from a generally high level of anxiety (HLOA). Since life as an HSP is such a challenge, it's a satisfying thing to find a whole franchise of books catering to all the different aspects of being sensitive in an insensitive world (SIAUW). It's very sensitive of the author to be catering to this need among the highly strung.
B000005RR0|5.0|If you don't want to dive headfirst into all of the biggest hits covered on \\"Forty Licks\\", \\"Jump Back\\" is a great place to start your Stones collection.<br />This was the first greatest hits collection to cover this period in the Stones' career, as their early career in the 1960s' has been covered countless times. This one does have its share of the classic hits, including \\"Brown Sugar\\" & \\"Start Me Up\\". But it also has its share of lesser known chart hits, including the funky \\"Hot Stuff\\", the achingly beautiful \\"Fool To Cry\\" ( Mick's true emotions finally come full circle on this one ) and \\"Mixed Emotions\\" ( featuring great harmonies on the tag ). Thrown in the mix too are \\"Wild Horses\\" ( probably their best ballad ), \\"Rock In A Hard Place\\" and \\"Undercover Of The Night\\".<br />I'm sure some people are going to complain about song omissions, and I would have too preferred songs like \\"Happy\\" and \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\", not to mention the \\"Just My Imagination\\" ( not a single, but I love this song ) and the Top 30 hit \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\". But \\"Jump Back\\" is a comprehensive enough hits collection and a good place to start if you want to get into the Stones' later period.
B000002TYX|5.0|NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT THE BEATLES ARE THE BEST BAND EVER!!!<BR>i mean seriously how can u say that the beatles were &quot;not that good!!! they are certainly a hell of a lot better than you will ever be! never mind it's useless to talk to close-minded people like you.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Irony is the master trope of the universe and this week, when the long wait for Sarah McLachlan's new CD finally ended, &quot;Room on Fire&quot; is the album I am listening to pretty much every time the television is off.  I also went back and picked up their first album, 2001's &quot;Is This It,&quot; which makes it pretty clear that this second effort is an attempt by the Strokes to build on a solid foundation.  Once again most of the eleven tracks have trouble breaking the 3-minute barrier and the basic song structure is the same that worked in the glory days of rock 'n' soll in the Sixties.  The end results is just as infectious and you really have to pay attention to what these five musicians are doing to appreciate how well they are hiding the fact their music is more complex this time around.  The lyrics are still focusing mostly on failed relationships, but I really tend to pay more attention to what Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond, Jr. are doing on their guitars while drummer Fabrizio Moretti and bassist Nikolai Faraiture drive the song along than what Julian Casablancas is singing in what is basically the background of the song.  It is amazing how different these songs are given how alike most of them sound.  But a relative ballad like &quot;Under Control&quot; really serves to emphasize the energy of &quot;What Ever Happened?,&quot; the melancholy of &quot;Automatic Stop,&quot; and the beat of &quot;12:51&quot; and &quot;The Way It Is.&quot;  I am reminded of what was said of another band earlier this year, that they were the kind of infectious it was good to be.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This week I watched The Matrix, and Matrix Reloaded before going to see Revolutions.  If you are looking for a sweet little film with a neat and happy ending - then don't bother.  But if you are more interested in an intelligent, exciting and extremely thought-provoking film - then Revolutions is the best.  You have to pay attention throughout the film if you want to truly understand.  The fight scenes were even better then the prior two films. The Oracle's role is fully answered.  The movie is intense from opening to closing scenes.  I will go see it again!
B00000JLWW|4.0|I think there is a reason why this movie is getting trashed so much.  People who have low self esteem and haven't really accomplished a lot in life make themselves feel better by tearing down something that is extremely popular such as the movie Titanic.  This movie made $600 Million in the United States, has sold millions of videos and DVDs, and it averages three and a half stars?  Most likely a lot of those who hate this movie don't get out much and write a lot of negative reviews in this forum.<br />First of all, the movie is not perfect.  Some of the dialogue in this movie is written so poorly it's hard to watch at times.  James Cameron can direct amazing action sequences but he has trouble directing two people in a room talking to each other.  And of course, there is the love story which is far from original.  Girl in the arranged marriage and she falls in love with another man who happens to come from the wrong side of the tracks.  Then there is the fact that wealthy people are stuck up snobs and they are shown in bad light.  Don't you love it when an industry as rich as Hollywood makes movies making wealthy people look bad?<br />With so much wrong why four stars? With all that is wrong with it the movie has a sense of elegance.  The story moves along at a good pace.  With the obvious distractions I was never bored in this three hour plus flick.  Yeah, the first hour or so was a little slow but once the Titanic hits that ice berg the film picks up pace.  There is a sense of awe watching this great ship begin to sink.  However, it loses a lot of it's grandeur on the small screen.  The score by James Horner is really nice although I am one of those grouches who hated the Celine Dion song the first time I heard it.  Then there is Billy Zane.  He had a small role but I hated him.  I was supposed to hate his character and he pulled that job off.  I didn't care a whole lot for Jack Dawson one way or another but I really hated that Calvin Hockley.  This is not a perfect movie by any means, nor is it a terrible movie.  There are those who hate the fact that this one the Best Picture award but hey, so did Shakespeare in Love and Gladiator.  Enjoy.<br />The only thing missing on this DVD is a documentary.  A lot went wrong while making this movie including a poisoned crew, a bloated budget, and a shot that run longer than expected.  Maybe a special two set DVD will be released someday.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I usually review music here at Amazon and not movies but I do so now because this is one of the more interesting flicks to come out of the dream/reality murkiness genre that underlies a lot of cult classics both on celluloid and in print. What makes this flick work is the various meaningful levels it can be viewed from...its open endedness that some critics complain about is really a strength. That Frank is really not developed as a character leaves you wondering who really was in control of time, was time in control of Darko or vice versa,  was Darko really mad, does Darko have an alter ego, is madness and time travel always synonymous, and are we bound up in fate or are meetings with fate established randomly (Frank again). There is that whole Borges question about whether the dreamer invents us or do we invent the dreamer (Liebnez's argument that no real interaction occurs within the universe...that everything is already internallly pre-determined and that reality merely reflects a mirrored image of what events have on one another can be argued here as one side of Borges dilemma). Also, there is the question of personal time travel and madness ( somebody must have been reading Doris Lessing).  There is the MacClean thing and the triune brain that wars with us, especially in our dream states..that that strange reptillian bunny that Frank creates is what is really what Darko struggles against, sometimes losing, but in the end triumphing over it when he destroys Frank and saves his girlfriend's life rather than giving in to the cold survival of his own being (real meaning of love?). Then there is the whole literalist mentality (James Hillman) thing going on with Cunningham and the gross oversimplification of achieving love and happiness by merely dropping all the complexities of the human soul and mind and becoming part of the &quot;animal realm.&quot; Then there is that whole Jungian thing of the shadow side of us, the experienced side (Blakes' Tyger Tyger in the night...)or what Lorca called &quot;the duende&quot;...(the prankster that will lead us through the land of the dead but would just as soon fool and kill us) which forces complexities ( and sometimes evil) on us no matter how much we grasp for simplistic answers to our problems. Then there are minor themes that deal with phychiatry and its role in regulating madness, fate and the truly tragic person ( though Darko's girlfriend's character could have been fleshed out more in her tragic persona), and the nature of education and what education really should and should not be. Finally, the soundtrack is pretty damn good too. <br />But the movie has its flaws. There is a lack of clarity as to why Darko's shrink is trying to call him near the end...there is really no tie in I could find to her knowing what happened to his girlfriend; so the reasoning there is a bit stretched. And where did all those bikes suddenly come from? Also, there is a lack of sophistication in the the time traveling scenarios that I thought had a great opportunity to be addressed through Roberta's book. I would have liked to see a meeting between Darko and the nutty Roberta...or at least some kind of explanation come out of her book that would have tied into Einstein, Hiesenberg, Godel or Bohm (&amp; Aspect's experiemnts of Bohm's theories). For these reasons, I almost dropped it a star, but I would like people to see this one because its &quot;works&quot; at so many levels...again destined to become a cult classic...like Liquid Sky...out of the New Wave era.
B00005NP04|5.0|I think that Martina McBride has one of the most under-rated voices out there. Every song on this disc is really great. But &quot;Whatever You Say&quot; and &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; are perfection.
B000002U8G|5.0|One Of These Days (I'm Going To Cut You Into Little Pieces)- this is a pulsating, fast paced rock song (song???) The song features the only vocals by Pink Floyd's drummer- Nick Mason. It is his chance to shine. And he does ;) . This is one of the heavier PF songs.<BR> Pillow Of Winds- this completely changes the mood of the album. It is a soft accoustic ballad that sounds very relaxing but is not as memorable as most other material on the record.<BR> Fearless- this is another PF song and is more upbeat and fast-tempo than &quot;pillow&quot;. The ending is quite interesting and the song in itself is quite feelgood.<BR> San Tropez- this, I always thought was somewhat a continuation of Fearless (with a different theme, of course). It is also a quite feelgood song and sounds pretty good althought it feels like filler and the CD doesn't benefit too much from it<BR> Seamus- this song is a joke and while it is funny sometimes I guess I just don't really get it. It is a blues melody with a dog barking and howling in the background.<BR> Echoes- this is one of the best songs ever. It is one of those songs that give you goosebumps. It starts with the infamous sonar like *ping* repeating over and over, fades into a wonderful 8 minute long song sounding somewhat like &quot;Breathe&quot;. After which it goes to a 4 minute jam session. After that it fades to a desolate, creepy sounding section with strange sound effects that sound like a pterodactyl probably would. Soon after a nice buildup it goes back to the main theme and eventually a sad sounding piano outro. <BR>Echoes and OOTD (if it was a bit longer too...) alone are worth the price and IMO the rest of the songs were just put so that it wouldn't be a 2 track LP.

B0000CD5FN|5.0|Simply one of the best albums I have ever heard in my life. During my first listen, I cried through all ten tracks, because I finally realized how much influence Joe Strummer had on me. He was at his core a street poet, someone that could have come out of the beat generation. And Streetcore is a testament to that. The 10 tracks are full of such raw emotion that it is tough not to sense it and to feel its beauty stirring within you. By the end of Silver and Gold, my heart was about to burst. Joe was my inspiration. Rest in peace.

B00005ATZT|5.0|The Fugitive, director Andrew Davis' (Under Siege) feature film adaptation of the classic 1960s television series, was one of 1993's biggest hits, thanks to the talents of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, who earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard.<br />Ford plays Chicago surgeon Dr. Richard Kimble (the late David Jansen's TV role), whose life is turned upside down when he is falsely accused of murdering his wife Helen (the luminous Sela Ward).  Taken to the Area Six police station, he undergoes the standard investigative process but can't convince the skeptical detectived that a one-armed intruder is the killer.  Arrrested, convicted and sentenced to death, Kimble is given a sudden and unexpected reprieve when a failed escape attempt causes the prison bus he's aboard to run off the road and land on a railroad track -- and in the path of an oncoming train.  Kimble escapes, but not before saving an injured corrections officer from certain death.<br />When Gerard and his team of deputies arrive at the crash scene, the other surviving corrections officer, in an attempt to cover up his incompetence and to take credit for saving his wounded colleague's life, at first claims all the passengers on board the bus were killed, but when sets of leg irons &quot;without legs in 'em&quot; are found, Gerard deduces that Kimble has survived and become a fugitive from the law.<br />The Fugitive compresses several seasons of Roy Huggins' suspense/morality play TV series, following Kimble's attempts to solve the mystery of the one-armed man while simultaneously evading Gerard's dogged pursuit. Along the way, however, Ford's version of Kimble follows in his television counterpart's footsteps as he changes his appearance and name to keep out of his pursuer's sight.  Yet, even as he risks life and liberty in his own investigation into who and why Helen was murdered, Kimble is true to his kind nature and his oath as a medical doctor, saving several people even at the risk of being discovered.  And as the good doctor closes in on the one-armed man, Gerard gets closer and closer to Kimble as the movie nears its revealing conclusion.<br />Davis and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and David Twohy tweak with the television series a bit, telling the entire story in a briskly paced 130-minute-long film, making Gerard a U.S. Marshal instead of a local police lieutenant. Yet, despite the focus on action and the added conspiracy motive behind Helen Kimble's murder, The Fugitive stays true to the spirit of the TV show. Like David Jansen, Ford is an actor most audiences genuinely like and love to cheer for, and Kimble's predicament and preserverance suit him well in this movie.  Jones, too, gives his Gerard both a steely determination to fulfill his mission and a mixture of humor and compassion that surfaces at unexpected moments.<br />The 2001 Special Edition DVD presents The Fugitive in its original widescreen format. Its extra features include interactive menus, commentary by director Davis and Tommy Lee Jones, two documentaries, a theatrical trailer, and subtitles/language tracks in English and French.people even at the risk of being discovered.

B00005JMFR|4.0|The Matrix Revolutions, the final part in the Matrix trilogy didn't disappoint, atleast me.  The acting and dialogue were not as exceptional as displayed in the first and hell maybe even second flim.  The action sequences were stunning, featuring excellent CGI.  Highlights include a ceiling shootout, an APU vs. the machine army battle and a grand finale betweeen Neo and his arch nemesis, Smith.  Unfortunately, the final confrontation was not as memorable as it could be in my opinion and it also seemed a bit short in time.  The fight scene between Smith and Neo in the original Matrix film was a lot more intense and suspenseful.<br />  As for the premise, well it's still slightly incomprehensible.  Essentially, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus return, and Zion is near total chaos.  The city must be protected for the war against the sentinels is rising.  Neo is on his mission to finally battle and hopefully kill his arch rival, Smith.  The ending of the film was inevitable and a little predictable in my opinion.  But all in all, this was a pretty entertaining film.  Though it must be stated that Reloaded & Revolutions are not at all as good as \\"The Matrix,\\" the true film which created a new visual style in cinema, with it's intricate plot, themes and concepts.  Reloaded has the best action of all three though and probably the most too.  I've heard a lot of negative reviews on this film, but hey it's not horrible and I should point out it's watchable.  Keanu Reeves, loses his ability to convey Neo as well as he did in the first, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus didn't seem to get much screen time.  Carrie-Anne Moss was quiet as Trinity, in fact the relationship between her and Neo wasn't very strong, if you know what I mean.  There wasn't a great deal of character development.<br />Even the inevitable appearance of Smith played masterfully by Hugo Weaving wasn't that great, considering he had only about 2 or 3 scenes.<br />  The Matrix Revolutions is rated R for Sci-Fi Violence and Brief Sexual Content.  The violence includes gunplay, fistfights and some bloody wounds.  This one has the most blood of all three films I'd say.  The sexuality is extremely mild, mainly brief nudity and sexual innuendo.  Also some profanity, not particularly strong, mainly some instances of the \\"s\\" word.  All in all, a fine film, and worth viewing in theatres.  Not too sure I'd buy this one yet on Video or DVD though.ce and Brief Sexual Content.  The violence includes gunplay, fistfights and some bloody wounds.

B0000B1OFL|5.0|A group of con-men steal a safe containing 35 million dollars worth of gold bricks (pretty elaborately) but when one of their own (Edward Norton) turn on them and takes the gold for himself, they fake their deaths and vow to track him down and get their gold back. Not the first time this story has been written, but who cares? It's funny, it's intelligent, it's fast-paced, and has a great cast (Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and more)- Along the same lines as Ocean's Eleven. I'm gonna add this one to my collection.
B0000019PA|5.0|I wanted to write a review of this album because I couldn't not.  This probably won't include anything new or fresh(hopefully, it won't be riddled with cliches either) and it definitely wont be the most elegant review in the history of amazon.com, so if that's your cup of tea you can read someone else's review.<BR>Okay, I love this cd.  The first time I listened to it I thought, &quot;Elizabeth, did you buy ANOTHER cd just for the beautiful cover art?&quot; (This cd is really an undescribable experience that all of you must begin to know and love-something will click I swear unless you &quot;don't have a soul&quot;) And thankfully the music morphed into something wonderful and distinct by the second time through and I now thoroughly enjoy it.  This is at least partly due to my fond appreciation of screaming (no, Jeffie does NOT, I repeat, NOT scream-at all), which has led to my love of that at times near screeching that is presented on this album and also the fact that poor Jeff has the hardest time pronouncing &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot; correctly (it's cute, really).<BR>One thing that will be very sad about this review is the fact that I don't have any other musician or band to compare NMH to, I, personally, don't usually listen to this type of music so I really have nothing to compare it to.  The best I can do is to say that it is embedded with some folk-like elements, though I am not saying that NMH is a folk band.  This is most apparent at the beginning of song two when Jeff is singing about Jesus Christ very loudly (this cd has a few religious references but not enough to make my inner atheist cringe).  There's also accordion music, now, who can go wrong there?<BR>My favourite song on this album is (not that any of you care, but I thought I'd cover all avenues...) &quot;Oh comely&quot;...  This song contains one of the most memorable lines ever &quot;your father made fetuses with flesh licking ladies&quot; (at least it's one of the only one's that Iremember); ahhh, the alliteration, which is also extremely prevalent throughout the entire song and the cd as a whole.  Just think of the joy that could potentially be awaiting you with fun, funky phrases like &quot;fat, fleshy fingers&quot;, &quot;soft, silly music is meaningful magic&quot; or &quot;sugary sweet machines smelling of semen&quot;.... very nice....
B0000BWVCM|5.0|This sequal to the first X-men adaptation of the Marvel comic books is SO darn good, I couldn't believe it. It is FAR better than part one, which I love. In part two, Magneto finds his escape from his maximum security plastic prison (in an absolutely amazing scene!), Proffesor X is drained (only for a while though), the school is unmasked as a refuge and training headquarters for mutants, Wolverine begins to discover his mutant origins, one of X-men turns and takes sides with Magneto's gang, and new characters are introduced. The effects in this movie are breath taking, the plot is superb. The entire movie was borderline perfect! I'm adding this one to my collection the day it comes out!
B00001OH7U|4.0|Station To Station marked a transition from the critically acclaimed glam rock of his previous material to the electronic Eno collaborations of the \\"Berlin Trilogy.\\" Bowie at the time was a serious coke fiend (he can't even remember recording most of this album) and was clearly pressed for new material--there are only six songs on Station To Station, all of them extended to four minutes-plus. This album also introduced a hauntingly dark new persona to replace the glam Ziggy Stardust--the fascist addict Thin White Duke.<br /><br />And yet, Station To Station ranks as one of Bowie's classics, up there with The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust, Low, and Scary Monsters. While there's not a lot of material to work with, what Bowie and his team of musicians (Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick on guitar, Roy Bittan on piano, Dennis Davis on drums, and George Murray on bass) do with it is consistently amazing. Bowie's voice sounds suprisingly soulful for all the drugs, belying the dark narrative.<br /><br />The epic opener of the title track effectively establishes the mood of the album and the introduction of the Thin White Duke. The lurching opening suggests a heavily laden locomotive chugging away, and midway into the song the band blasts off into an incredible jam that goes until the ten-minute mark. A lot of fans call this their favorite Bowie cut, and I can understand why. Golden Years is the only commercial single, a catchy, funky tune with a fine vocal by Bowie. TVC15 and Stay are brilliant and funky tracks that are wonderfully energetic and endlessly repeatable. The album is rounded up nicely with Word On A Wing and Wild Is The Wind, both decent ballads--a little maudlin, perhaps, but listenable.<br /><br />This is a great introduction to Bowie, because it bridges the gap between the more popular glam-rock material preceding it and the more challenging Kraftwerk-inspired trilogy that followed. Start here, then go either forward to Low, Heroes, and Scary Monsters or backward to Aladdin Sane, Hunky Dory, and the two Ziggy Stardust albums. All and all, an essential Bowie record.Hunky Dory, and the two Ziggy Stardust albums. All and all, an essential Bowie record.
B00005JM02|5.0|Definitely one of the best Disney films I have seen in years. Personally I felt Disney had been going downhill after The Lion King, give or take a few, but Finding Nemo is an EXCELLENT movie! I got it for my daughter, who loves it,but my husband and I were both equally entertained. Nemo is a handicap fish (one fin is smaller than the other) who gets taken by a fisherman as an addition to his fish collection and his over-protective, worry-wort father, Marlin, swims all the way across the ocean with help of a new friend Dory (Ellen Degenerous) to get his son back. It a beautiful story about father and son, the lengths that any parent will go to in order to protect their children, lessons in differences, and lessons in learning how to let go. Kids will love it for the goofiness and undersea visuals, adults will love it for the heart warming story and underlying jokes. No DVD or Disney collection will be complete without this one!
B00006RU5B|5.0|It's incredible. I heard of Audioslave from my older brother, he let me listen to Cochise and I loved it. I watch bought the album a while back and Audoslave is now my most favorite band ever. I found out who Audioslave consisted of and went crazy. I knew it sounded like Chris Cornell from Soungarden singing when I first listened to it and to my surprise it was! Soundgarden was my most favorite band before I knew Audioslave. Audioslave also has one of the best lead guitarists of modern day rock, that guy is Tom Morello. I enjoy hearing the kick ass music of the vocalist from Soundgarden and the musicians from Rage Against The Machine combine produce the album of the millennium. Cochise, Show Me How To Live, Like A Stone, Shadow On The Sun, and Exploder are my most favorite songs on the album. Set It Off and Bring 'Em Back Alive are the two LESS GOOD ones of the album. Nothing by Audioslave comes close to sucking. , so there. Cochise really gets you pumped with the awsome guitar tunes. Show Me How To Live just has one hell of a music video so naturally I just like it. LIke A Stone the words catch me so that;'s the good one. Shadow On The Sun has one of those names that makes it look like a good song and it lives up to it, too. Exploder I really like the vocals in it sounds like Led Zepplin. Here's how I rank them:<br />Cochise 10/10<BR>Show Me How To Live 09/10<BR>Gasoline 09/10<BR>Waht You Are 08/10<BR>Like A Stone 10/10 My Favorite Song Of The Album<BR>Set It Off 07/10<BR>Shadow On The Sun 10/10<BR>I Am The Highway 09/10<BR>Exploder 10/10<BR>Hypnotize 09/10<BR>Bring 'Em Back Alive 07/10 My Least Favorite Song Of The Album<BR>Light My Way 08/10<BR>Getaway Car 07/10<BR>The Last Remaining Light 09/10<br />Buy Audioslave It ROCKS. I Guarantee it.
B00005JMFR|4.0|I did not know what to think coming into the third Matrix movie. I was a fan of the first two. What I saw though was a film that was certainly different from the first two. The first one was essentially a mystery - a quest to discover what the matrix was and what was going on. The second film was a kung fu/action film which I found personally quite enjoyable (especially the freeway chase). The third film however was completely different from the first two. With only two fights scenes occuring within the Matrix and 90% of the film in the \\"real world\\" the film smacked more of Aliens than the Matrix (especially with those mechs...) - the action was of a completely different nature to all that that came before - whilst spectacular lacked some of the magic that defined the first two. It was a bit too symbolic with the blinding of Neo etc and the obvious christ metaphor with Neo splayed out at the end and all the Satrian philosophy with the train station etc. The movie was enjoyable although some of the dialog was a bit dodgy in places, especially at the start. It was certainly different from the first two but I believe deserves a second viewing

0156027321|5.0|There's just something endearing about this one.  I can't even put my finger quite on it.  The bulk of it could be considered rather mundane - a lot of routine, a lot of description of tarpaulins and ropes and daily monotony.  The story is amazingly simple and straightforward and uncomplex on the surface.  Yet . . . it holds you.  You take this journey with Richard Parker and before you know it, you've been at sea for 7 months and he's gone.  And it's not just Pi who lives that disappointment -- I did too.  The ending, too, just left me on a sublime note; I cannot imagine a better way to have left the story.  Is it &quot;really&quot; a true story?  I cannot tell you.  Did Pi even really experience what he seemed to in the context of this (fictional?) world?  I can't even give a 100% answer of that.  But as so often happens, we are more affected by the journey and its impact rather than the strangely unimportant question of &quot;is it real?&quot;
B00008NRL8|5.0|Each cut on this cd is filled with excitement and great, blazing color.  This group's transnational personality couples Brazil's  sexy tango heritage with the cool nightlife found in Paris dance clubs, and cafes all along the Mediterranean.  The group personnel is a superb mixture of the above, and the sound they generate is spectacularly good.  Listen to \\"Last Tango in Paris\\" and you can hear what the movie could have been and almost was, but fell short of.  I hope that the group finds the kind of success necessary to generate more work, more recordings and appearances.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have to admit, it was with a certain amount of tredipation that I purchased this cd, after hearing mixed reviews.  I was hopefull though, after hearing Sarah perform &quot;Fallen&quot; on David Letterman.  I've listened through it several times, and I must say that I'm very pleased.  The songs are not ones to jump out and immediately demand your attention, and at first I mistook them as being not that great, but upon my second run through, I realized they are actually quite brilliant.  My guess is that people who thought &quot;Surfacing&quot; was disappointing will find this a let down as well. For the rest of us normal people, it will be an incredibly enjoyable experience.  These are all great songs, if you just give them a chance to work their magic. Right now my current favorites are Fallen, Drifting, Push, and Time. After having to endure years of Britney Spears, numerous boy bands and the like, Sarah is the light at the end of the long, dark tunnel.
B00005JM02|5.0|I'm from Australia, i couldn't wait to get the DVD special edition for Finding Nemo. so I bought it from America through the net. I thought this movie is really cool and it's been long time that i haven't enjoyed the movie that totally rock.<BR>When i first saw the movie in the cinema, i went to see it twice and i sworn to myself that i definately collect the DVD for it when it first comes out. the story line is excellent, the animation is fabulous and technical welldone. i really admire the whole thing from the making of it to the whole entire movie. it's really worth collecting this fantastic DVd for Finding Nemo
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This newest release from an incredible woman, with an incredible voice is just that...resplendent beauty.  As a fan that traveled to many Concerts and Lillith Fairs, and has purchased many import cd's to have as much of this wonderful voice as possible, I was extremely disappointed to find this cd only has 40 minutes of music.  This is the first album of Sarah's that has NO BONUS TRACK.  I'd listen to this beautiful woman sing in the shower if it was on a cd.   So Sarah fans, you'll love the lyrics, the vocals, the presence you will feel while listening to this newest endeavor, however, if you're like me, after waiting 6 years for a new release, you'll be disappointed that there is not more of it to enjoy.
B00005R24K|4.0|This is a really fun &quot;B&quot; movie.  If you like horror movies featuring gore and dismemberment, then add this to your collection.  The special effects are a bit &quot;cheesy&quot;, but it's all in good fun!<br />Recommended.
B000001GPX|5.0|When it comes to Beethoven's symphonies I highly recommend spending a little extra to get the entire cycle, as provided by Herbert Von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic (Polygram Records - #429036). The quality is exceptional, while the 5 cd set averages to about $7/cd. With that said however, I must admit that this Kleiber recording is my only exception. It is hard to verbally explain why, but at the very least I should say that there is a degree of energy and passion to Kleiber's which makes listening an experience of spiritual proportions.
0780631684|4.0|This is a &quot;killer&quot; teen movie with a new twist.  Good acting, great special effects, and a fun ride.<br />Recommended.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|DT have once again produced an absolutely incredible album, with the usual complex arrangements and lengthy soloing. Petrucci in particular is all OVER this album! He just shreds, and wails! Portnoy remains the powerhouse bundle of energy he has always been.The grooves laid down by all 4 instrumentalists in this band are thick, heavy and guaranteed to make you bob your head, scowl, and give the 'Metal' sign with your fingers. And this is indeed metal. Prog-metal though DT may be, on this album they show flashes of more standard metal throughout. \\"This Dying Soul\\" has a serious Maidenesque guitar part, and leadoff track \\"As I Am\\" has some serious Metallica sound. The 11-minute instrumental track \\"Stream of Conciousness\\" will leave the DT freaks on the floor, minds blown. The strongest track, though, is the epic closer \\"In The Name Of God\\", which, although still very new to these ears, may well be the finest track Dream Theater have ever produced. This album is a highlight in their career. Superb from beginning to end.
0780624890|4.0|This is an exciting movie.  I don't usually use that word to describe a movie, but it fits here.  This film opens on a high action note and the whole movie flows well.  The special effects are a sight to behold!  Full of action that doesn't stop.<br />Highly recommended.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|So if you're reading this, you've already seen the reviews of other fans saying how great<BR>this series is. I won't repeat that. It was simply put one of the best shows of the last dozen<BR>years and I'm not easily impressed. <br />I wanted to post a defense of the stronger Western aspect that some people have<BR>commented on. The reason for so many of the worlds looking Old Westernish is well and<BR>properly explained in the series. The storyline Firefly is set in is two sided, the wealthy<BR>core planets with ultra high tech and the dirt poor colony worlds that start off with<BR>nothing. The two are blended well and since our heroes move about doing whatever work<BR>they can find, they move from tech to poor and back again. It works, it blends well and<BR>more importantly, it's a load of fun. <br />Firefly moves in a world far more realistic than we normally see in a series. The characters<BR>are human and complex and I agree totally, the theme song kicked major backside! <br />Can not wait for the DVD and I WILL be first in line when the movie is out!!
B00005JLKN|5.0|Much more watchable than &quot;Manhunter&quot;.  This film has style, is well-acted, and doesn't feel so &quot;1980's&quot;, unlike &quot;Manhunter&quot;.  Plus, it features Sir Anthony doing his thing as Hannibal.<br />Highly recommended.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Fantastic, passionate and beautiful is what I have to say about Gavin DeGraw's debut album. I am looking forward to catching him live because I imagine that his passion and energetic voice, which one senses through his album, only enhances and adds fullness to the music and lyrics. His voice does remind me of Stevie Wonder and his piano skills are Billy Joel-like as other reviewers have said, but I must say he stands in a category of his own. The lyrics are mature and experienced and Gavin's energy makes the album an instant favorite on my list. Buy it and smile, for this is only the beginning for a promising talent.
6305137293|3.0|What's interesting about this sequel is that it picks up directly where the first ended.  It's a seamless transition and a worthy addition to the Halloween series.<br />Recommended.
B0000AQZYM|4.0|pixar(makers of the famous Toy Storys, Bugs Life and Mosters Inc) comes this success involving a missing fish called Nemo and his dad has to find him,and in the process meeting strange underwater creatures. with colorful and nice animation, this one is a keeper for kids. a gem. one of the best of 2003 for kids. Albert Brooks as Nemo's fish is hilarious
B00003CXFG|4.0|A great movie featuriing good acting, directing, and use of lighting to tell a story of creepy inhabitants of another planet.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JMFR|3.0|I agree with the writer of the review a few posts down, Revolutions has a very bittersweet ending, it makes me sad because it could have ended another way without losing Neo and Trinity, most of the scenes take place in the real world and Zion, wich is also a slight letdown, not as much \\" in matrix action\\" mostly real-world horrific warzone, it get's really bloody and takes a little out of a horror movie, I found myself thinking \\"am I watching the matrix? or machine jurassic park?\\"<br />But the beginning was interesting, the oracles body guard does some helpful action, and Smith loses his mind altogether...<br />It didn't really feel like a Matrix film to me, but I guess everyone will see it differently. I got the point after the ending, but they didn't have to go about it the way they did.
6305291446|5.0|THE most worthy sequel to Halloween.  Fresh, innovative, and featuring the return of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  This one has all the suspense, thrills, and chills we loved in the original Halloween.  Also features a great cast, who does a wonderful job!<br />Very highly recommended!
B00005JMFR|4.0|You know, it amazes me, judging from the many negative reviews on here, how people don't seem to want to watch a movie with an open mind.  Granted, movies are suppose to be entertaining and relieve some stress, but who says it can't do that and make you think at the same time?  Movies like that are ones you never get tired of.  Just look at Lord of the Rings.<br />Matrix Revolutions ended the trilogy wonderfully.  Not only where there awesome battle sequences and cool visuals(in particular, Machine City), but it really went out to prove the points the Wachowski brothers wanted to make through their Christian/Judaism/Hinduism theologies.  It wasn't all perfect, but it explained the theme of all having a purpose in life itself and how much we use our gifts to see to that purpose and find out truth very well.  And isn't that something we'd all like to do?  You may not think that in every-day life, but deep down, I know that's something we all want to know.<br />The acting was decent enough for our three main heroes, but Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith stole it for me.  He is probably the greatest sci-fi/action villain to come out in the 21st century.  And his final battle with Neo was simply breathtaking.  Reeves portrayed Neo good too, constantly pondering where his place is in this war and how it's going to end.  Overall, the acting wasn't that bad that a lot of critics seemed to bash in their reviews, although I do admit a little more emotion needed to be shown in some people.  I mean, there are thousands of Sentinels about to kill them, wouldn't you be scared to death?  <br />My gripes were little but kept it from being a perfect score.  First off, Morpheus did absolutely nothing in this movie.  OK, you can count him being a co-pilot, but what does that do for him?  Seemed like a big downfall for the man who helped find the One.  I already stated that some actors could show a little more emotion and there were a couple of loose plotlines that never really were cleared up, mostly dealing with the Frenchman and the Architect.  But from the way they ended the movie, it could be something the Wachowskis could deal with in the future.  Hmmm....<br />All in all, Revolutions was probably the 2nd best of the trilogy.  Better than Reloaded, but not the original.  That should be an obvious considering how innovative the first movie was at the time.  But it's a solid flick that really got unfair reviews.  Open your mind to the Matrix movies and try not to think every sci-fi flick has to have nothing but action.  It is indeed a good action flick, but it's also about seeking your purpose in life and how to make the most of it, something myself, being a Christian, try to seek and carry out every day of my life in order to reach the \\"truth\\".  That's just from my perspective so take this review anyway you want it.  I just know this movie made my thumbs go up.
B0000524CY|5.0|This movie is a worthy addition to your DVD horror library.  It features a refreshing balance of drama and horror.  The horror builds very gradually, almost seeping into the lives of the main characters.  Great acting, great directing.<br />Very highly recommended.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Every once in a while, a movie spoof gets it right, e.g. NAKED GUN, HOT SHOTS, TOP SECRET.  I have to add the Wayans SCARY MOVIE to that list.  Even 12 years later, I still laugh through most of this movie.  Sure, it's often crude and offensive, but it's outrageously hilarious.  Anna Faris became a marketable star with this and nobody could have done it better.  Shawn and Damon Wayans, Lochlyn Munro, Regina Hall, Rick Ducommun and yes even Carmen Electra are perfect in their support.  The next 3 sequels aren't quite as funny and I'm not sure the upcoming SM5 will work since Faris and Hall are not involved.<br />Anyway, SCARY MOVIE is in my spoof hall of fame.
B00005QW4K|4.0|A strange entry into the Evil Dead series.  Worth a look, this movie retains its trademark humor and gore mixture.<br />Recommended.
B00005JMFO|5.0|If you loved Bridget Jones's Diary you will most likely love this movie. It is fun and clever, with quite a few great performances. There are multiple storylines happening simultaneously and so, yes, inevitably some fall to the wayside. However, the movie sticks to its title. Everything is about love, in all its incarnations: new love, forbidden love, love of the family, love at first sight, first love...and all the humor and drama involved therein. I highly recommend it!<br />On a side note...a few reviewers have mentioned \\"political overtones\\" in this movie being a problem. I utterly disagree. The 9/11 attacks are mentioned in the opening monologue. This was done not to exploit those who died, but to speculate that they were probably thinking about the ones they loved, not about whom they hated. And a press conference scene between the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the President (Billy Bob Thornton)is actually in NO WAY POLITICAL. Its all about a girl. See the movie yourself and you be the judge.
B00003CXSP|4.0|This cinematography in this film is remarkable.  The plot, however, is a bit weak.  The absence of Ms. Foster affects the film in obvious ways.  On the whole, the film works despite its flaws.<br />Recommended.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|This was Van Halen's first CD. I dont think it could have gotton much better than this. Van Halen sounded raw rock n roll style which was very cool. Some of my favorites on this CD are You Really Got Me, Eruption, Running With The Devil, and Jamies Cryin. This CD is a must have for anyone a classic rock fan or a rock n roll fan. I rated this 5 stars listen to some of the samples just to get a idea how powerful this band really are. I cant really say much more but buy it!!!
0792164903|4.0|A refreshing interpretation of the Sleepy Hollow legend.  Featuring humor, good special effects, and a great feel for the period portrayed.<br />Highly recommended.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Im a Jimi Hendrix Fan also a Stevie Ray Vaughan fan. Texas Flood marks to be SRVS first album. This is one of my favorite SRVS CDs. Here is the song list for this album Love Struck Baby, Pride And Joy, Texas Flood, Tell Me, Testify, Rude Mood, Mary Had A Little Lamb, Dirty Pool, I'm Cryin', and Lenny. The deserves 5 stars because its a classic stevie ray CD. The Bonus Tracks are even better heres the list for the bonus tracks SRV speaks, Tin Pan Alley, Testify, Mary Had Alittle Lamb(live), Wham(live).

B00000DHZJ|5.0|This CD is great for what it is. I mean of course alot of people who write reviews on this CD will give there opions but if you really want to know the truth about this CD then READ THIS. This CD is a great starter album for a Hendrix fan or a first time listener. If you have all Hendrix's CDs then you dont need this one. This just covers some of Hendrix's greatest hits from Purple Haze to All Along The Wacthower. Alot of reviwers write no Machine Gun but Hendrix never did Machine Gun in the studio and that was not his hit. But I have to give this CD 5 because it still have some great music. My favorite is All Along The Wacthower. Check out my other reviews for more Hendrix!!!!
6305841861|3.0|Funny, yet &quot;terrifying&quot; sequel to Evil Dead.  Increased gore with mediocre acting--all done in good fun!<br />Recommended.
B000002P7R|5.0|This CD gives you an rare look behind Jimi Hendrix's music. I love to listen to unreleased Hendrix stuff. This CD includes Message To Love, Midnight, Little Wing, All Along The Wacthower, and many others. This gives you a prime example of Hendrix's latest work on CD. If your a Hendrix fan you should buy this but others may not appreciate this CD as much as the Hendrix fans. This CD provides the best sounding quality. The music comes first then theres the booklet thats included with rare Hendrix photos. I would say this is a must have I rated this 5 stars Experience Hendrix did a good job on this CD. Enjoy!!
B00005JL3A|4.0|A decent translation of the Playstation game onto the silver screen.  Good acting, good special effects, and compelling story move this film along.<br />Recommended.
B00001R3GF|5.0|The Rolling Stones have had some great albums over the years. No other album could compare to this one Some Girls is a classic also my favorite. Some Girls reached number 1 on the charts selling over 8 million copies. My favorites are Miss You, Shattered, Far Away Eyes, and Some Girls. This is a must have to add to your Rolling Stone collection. I love the Limited Edition with the pull out faces its so cool. The sound is amazing expesically being Remastered. I gave this 5 stars if your looking to buy this Limited Edition version of Some Girls then please go ahead. Listen to the samples for an insight on this classic. ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKWJ|3.0|This film, though not as good as the original, is a marvel of special effects.  The plot is less coherent (and, ultimately, less believable) and moves a bit more slowly.  What's missing here is some originality.  We've seen most of this in the first Blade movie.<br />Rental only.  Buy if you're a fan of the series.
B000002KHH|5.0|Paronid made its debut back in 1970 the best part about this album is the music and the band. Iron Man just kicks ass I have to say im not a big Black Sabbath fan but I do love there first 5 albums. War Pigs, and Paronid dont have the intensity as Iron Man but there still great songs. The rest of the songs just go with the album. If your a rock n roller then buy this without second thought. This is a classic that should be added in your collection for great rock n roll memories. 5 STARS it is Black Sabbath Paranoid enjoy.
6305971099|3.0|This fifth movie in the Halloween series follows events featured in the fourth Hallowween movie.  Watching this, one gets the feeling that the franchise is getting old and those at the helm are running out of ideas.<br />Rental only.
B00005NB0H|5.0|The Who played Leeds in Feburary 1970. The concert was a smash hit it was sold out. When the Who came out on stage the crowd really got fired up with I Cant Explain. The Who did trumendus numbers like Pinball Wizard and Fortune Teller. This is my favorite Who CD yet the deluxe edition is the must have. The Deluxe Edition includes a huge booklet with pictures and writings its certainly Deluxe. If you like the early who then buy this. Around the same time they played The Isle Of Wight I have not yet listened to that concert but I know for a fact that Live At Leeds was better and longer. If your a Who fan then buy this Deluxe Edition if your not then I suggest you dont buy this yet go with something else like the new Who's greatest hits CD I also wrote a review about that CD if you want to check it out. Listen to the samples and see what you like I loved this CD and I rated it a 5/5 one more word for you ENJOY!!!!!!
B000060MMI|1.0|I couldn't disagree more strongly with the reviewer from Toledo, who labeled our precious Mollies &quot;only the most hirudinoid pantaloons to infest our granary since Lazar Kaganovich peddled veratric to the unwashed&quot;. Strong words, but groundless. Our Mollies have not once strayed from their appointed task of restrictive indorsement. Furthermore, it was established long ago that lead singer Bosie Douglas never remaindered so much as a mustiline, much less &quot;sought to suborn it bilaterally,&quot; whatever the hell that means. Frankly, it takes real gall to insinuate such rubbish. Seeing as how this is only their sophomore effort, one might expect aleatoric invention, or at least monodical rigor. But, alas, all we get here is tenebrous progressions linked hyperbolically to supposedly &quot;seminal&quot; directorates. Anyone who thought this time we'd be reconnected was sadly deluded. Next time, take the 106 bus and transfer before hitting this supervenience!
B00004THDI|5.0|Set in the civil war era,\\"Dances With Wolves\\" is a western dramatic encompasing the untamed breathtaking wilderness of the West, with a pinch of melodrama . In fact, \\"Dances with Wolves\\" cut across movie genres and levitated itself to becoming one of the most poignant and epic movies of all time. But it wouldn't have achieved such recognition without the haunting but beautiful score that John Barry composed: the music fitting every scene of the movie seamlessly. As expansive as the movie itself, the score does not just strike a cord every time you play, but places you in the boots of John Dunbar and how he feels as a lonely man set across two worlds that teach him very different truths about life ; the rush of the Buffalos, the intimacy with his beloved horse Cisco, his relation and feelings towards the Sioux, the battle against his own legions and of course...his dance with the  wolves!. Buy the album and see..no,no...feel it for yourself. There are very few scores right now, that will leave you utterly spellbound and introspective; and this score is certainly one of them.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Well, it was a great trilogy up until the last 20 to 15 minutes at the end of REVOLUTIONS. Very confusing ending, bu I did manage to make some sense of it. It seemed like a weak ending and a ignorant way to end some of the characters lives.... they had been through everything just to meet a cheap and very sad demise. Although some good things came from that demise i suppose... but no the ending we deserved.<br />REVOLUTIONS was amazing other than that, as well as Reloaded and the original, but as a fan, its hard to see the \\"Reason\\" why the wachowski brothers ended the series as they did<br />There were alot of gap's and holes that should have been closed that weren't though, and it seemed the storyline could have had more to it.<br />But, as far as Trinity and Neo.... for them this one was Film Noir.... no happy endings.<br />but although Silver the producer can say there wont be any more matrix movies all he wans, I personally think its a bunch of crap.... Revolutions doesnt appear to be any sort of \\"Final\\" conclusion and has too many possibilities for further installments..... either Silver is out of his mind, or he's lying for whatever purpose it is. Besides, I don't beleive Warner Brothers is going to let one of their best films end so easily.... I'm shure if they had to, they'd yank the rights straight from Silver's hands and hand the project to someone else.<br />But maybe not. Maybe it is the final movie. <br />Then again, sometimes fans get lucky. Something good comes out of it. Something we know we wouldnt deserve in a million years.<BR> <br />;-)<br />radiantz
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I beleive the matrix Realoaded was great.  Although it wasn't as good as the first one (nothing could be) it was a good follow up and bridge to the final installment.  It is said the the seond moonie in a trilogy is the hardest but this movie gets very close to the first one.  Now Ive seen all three movies and I have to say that all of them are very diffrent but they hold their own well through the series.  The action was great, and the dialoge wasn't bad concidering that this movies purpose was to get to Revolutions.  Also the the three major characters, ( played by Reeves, Moss, and Fishourne) hold their own very well, and do a great job of keeping the story going and exiting.  So I think people made a big mistake comparing the first two installments to each other because they are both great in different ways.  Plus you should watch the movie at least once for it's spectacular special effects.
0792151712|4.0|Titanic the movie came out when I was in third grade, and I was the only one in my class who didn't see it. You have no idea how happy I am about it. My friends all told me that it was a waste of time, and not even to bother with the movie, but I knew I had to see it. When the movie came out, my dad and I watched every documentary on the Titanic, knew every fact, read every book. Now I've finally seen the movie. 6 years later, I finally understand why those 8 year olds didn't like the movie. They didn't get a single detail about it. But I'll tell you what...I cried like a baby almost an hour before the end. So now my friends have fair warning...tell me that the movie stinks and I'll tie you down to the couch and force you to watch it until you can memorize the movie. :-D
B00005JMFI|4.0|Was pleasantly surprised by this movie - was expecting something much worse.   There are several parts that are incredibly funny.  If you're looking for a light-hearted movie to take your children to during the holidays, this is it.
B000000WJK|5.0|It is truly hard to believe that this album was released in '93.   The sound is so timeless, whereas any other '93 (or other era) grunge/rap/pop related music is instantly discernable as to the when and where of it all.   The Verve managed to produce a seminal album that will seem as vibrant and timely many years into the future.   My freshman year of college would have been quite different had I never stumbled upon this record at School Kids record store in Athens, OH.   Truthfully, this album will not be for everyone, there hasn't been or ever will be an album created that will manage to please the masses, just look at the swill that goes platinum now.   But, the comparisons to the best of Pink Floyd and Stone Roses aren't far off the mark.   Come see what the beginning of the second British invasion was really about in the mid-90s.   This is one of those albums that just fell through the cracks because (thankfully) it wasn't something MTV could latch onto and promote to death.   If you enjoy music, and are looking for a 10 year old breath of fresh air, just listen to the 1st note from Star Sail and you'll know you are in for a hell of a ride. <br />Adios...
B00000G3Q4|3.0|I have to frankly admit that I was hesitant in purchasing this DVD. The reason being is that I purchased \\"Evil Dead 2\\" first after reading several of the rave reviews posted on this site. I was extremely disappointed with it, at first (I have since re-watched the sequel multiple times and I like it now, almost as much as the original. Sometimes you need watch a film more than once I guess).<br /><br />The story deals with several people spending some quiet time in an isolated cabin in the middle of nowhere. They accidentally stumble upon an old book - the very powerful \\"Book Of The Dead\\" and foolishly recite some of its incantations and in doing so, unleash hell upon themselves. The demons start by raping one of the unfortunate girls and later possess her. The victim, once it is clearly evident that she is possessed by a malevolent demon, is put under restraint and thrown in the cellar however the demonic infection is passed to others until the only one left is our hero Ash who must fight to survive amongst the possessed. The film moves along at a good pace and there is gore-a-plenty. What makes this film slightly superior than its sequel, in my opinion, is that it's scarier despite its much lower budget (\\"Dead by Dawn\\" clearly had a better budget and better special effects). It is over the top but not  to the extent of the sequel. There are no severed walking hands, laughing moose-heads or laughing lamps. What you get are frightening possession scenes, reminiscent of \\"The Exorcist\\", pencil stabbings, be-headings and a lot of blood and slimy gore. The films major strength lies in it's creativity and excellent make-up effects, although some of the clay-mation effects in the climax are a bit cheesy and not as effective.<br /><br />Gore-hounds and horror film fans will find a lot to like in this fast paced shocker that delivers the goods despite it obvious low budget.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5
B00000K19E|5.0|For four years, people had been telling me how great this movie was, but for some reason I never got around to seeing it.  Sick of people talking about it and people messing with me because I hadn't seen it, I rented the DVD, and I must say it is one of the best action flicks I have ever seen!  Unlike most films that get bragged about in today's society, this one actually lives up to expectations, if not surpasses them.  After now seeing the movies that followed this masterpiece, I must say that this has by far the strongest plot of the trilogy, since the other two focus on action more.  The characters in this movie are unforgettable, despite me not being a big fan of Reeves.  I especially think that Fisburne takes the cake with his character of Morpheous, and I think that Moss does an outstanding job as the leading lady in Trinity.  So overall, this is one movie that everyone should see and lives up to expectations!
B000005IRG|3.0|this is 8 songs, some of them a little on the boring side. &quot;Marquee Moon&quot;, laid back as it is, is good, with haunting lyrics. The song &quot;Friction&quot; is the most powerful thing here (really one of only 2 rockers in the whole set). The dual guitar work in &quot;Friction&quot; is about the best I have ever heard, it sends chills up my spine sometimes. Killer tune. Other than that-it's almost easy listening. It IS a LITLE too rough for the Cheryl Crow market, but not by all that much. This reminds you of what was called &quot;progressive rock&quot;, as much, no MORE, than punk.
B000066NW0|1.0|once i heard this i had a new hate in my life...i know that all of you little pathetic avril loving souls out there are gonna hate me because i am picking on this pathetic excuse for a singer and this sad excuse for an album (what a waste of plastic!!) Heres my top 3 reasons why avril sucks a lot:<br />1. she can't sing...(plus, all her S's sound like SH's, god! go to speech therapy or something!...its so annoying!)<br />2. she's one hell of a freaken poser!...she says 'i can play guitar!', yet i never see her do it...she says shes punk (and that, thankfully, has made people hate her some more)she has the label 'anti-britney' but most people in their right mind know shes going to turn into the next whorish britney<br />3. she's planning on making a new cd...(more waste of plastic!)<br />i could come up with more but its such a waste of time talkin about HER...i would have gaven this cd a zero, but, unfortunatly they dont give you that option...i know the next people who are going to write more reviews are gonna say not to listen to me...but hey, i speak the truth! dont listen to THEM!<br />to end this little avril extravaganza...dont WASTE your money!!!!
B000002AP1|4.0|The Stooges have Iggy singing, and Scott Asheton on drums (although he's not lively here-basically he comes off as a session drummer, while he really stood apart from the band before). Ron Asheton moves to bass (and does a fine job), replacing the underrated Dave Alexander. The new guy on guitar (James Williamson) is good...but it just doesn't sound like the Stooges-although the song compositions are in the same vein (if more complex). The production is wierd-a little murky. &quot;Iggy does Alice Cooper&quot; almost!
B00005RFAI|4.0|im almost ashamed to like this cd, but nobody should be cuz its actually really good... she can actually sing...unlike somepeoples, and i wont say their name!!...but this cd has been called pop but i think its more than that and every song on here rulz...except..misery.....THAT SONG RUINED IT ALL!!!...not really i could just skip it but i literally cant listen to that song, its painful, but the rest of this rox a lot
B000001FMX|4.0|These songs are very good. The production is murky, which probably works for the better in this case. The Dolls dress in womens's clothes and (I think) Army boots-not a real cross-dressing thing as much as a pose. It's not as heavy as the early punk type music that came just before them (MC5, Stooges), but is probably as heavy as most of what came out as punk later in the 70's. The melodies of these tunes are based on 50's rock (which in this case is a positive thing). Lyrics reflect New York, the era the Dolls lived in, and loneliness/isolation. This is a fun, powerful piece of music. the Dolls live up to their rep here, and there are no duds on this album, although there are a few moments of punk rock noise punctuating the very cool melodies. Better than the first Kiss album easily, and quite possibly glam's finest moment.
B000069HK2|2.0|i really like all the music on here . but its just the singer's voice that gets on my nerves<br />i love taste of ink and a few others but i cant remember 'em considering i took this cd to the pawn shop a while back...taste of ink is so catchy i listen to it over and over again. i give that song a 5. i would have given this cd a 4 or something but the guys voice bugs me THAT MUCH
B00005JMFR|4.0|WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU SAD, UNAPPRECIATIVE and obviously LONELY people?! Okay, maybe that was a bit harsh, but COME ON!  Horrible?  Trash??  I mean really, what was the last good trilogy or even sequel you've seen?  Charlie's Angels 2?  The 'Friday' series?  102 Dalmations?  Get real...  The Matrix: Revolutions solidifies the 'Matrix' franchise's status as one of the great trilogies in moviemaking/storytelling history.  True Matrix fans, while undoubtedly dizzy from following the jump from the original to 'Reloaded', appreciate the movies for what they were - MOVIES.  Movies that made you think, long after you left the theater, coupled with groundbreaking special effects and intricate fighting sequences.  Everyone from kids to college professors have theorized on the possible paths this final chapter may take to draw this series to a close - many people didn't even know who the real Merovingians were, now they are drawing up all sorts of hypotheses and synopses.  If nothing else, 'Reloaded' taught us to always carry a thesaurus.  <br />For those of you who never even liked the original -WHY ARE YOU WATCHING THEM?  What are you expecting to see - VeggieTales?  And for those of you who did like the first 'Matrix', but not the sequels... I ask that you check your own expectations of the films prior to seeing them.  If you're like the majority of us (movie audiences), you had them set way too high.  This is definately not a movie I'd recommend watching if you haven't followed the entire series, since in essence it's telling one grand story.  This is to include the 'Animatrix' short films, as well as the 'Enter the Matrix' video game which took place during 'Reloaded'.<br />Breathe...<br />Okay.  The Matrix: Revolutions.<br />The movie (which was filmed simultaneously with 'Reloaded') picks up exactly where we left off in part 2: the machines are advancing rapidly towards the last human city - Zion - and the citizens are bracing themselves for what lies ahead.  Neo is still in limbo, torn between the 'real world' and the Matrix, and Agent Smith is spreading like wildfire throughout the Matrix.  He has also cleverly managed to take over the body of a Zion soldier (Bane), and proceeded to sabotage his ship's role in the preliminary military offensive... resulting in the rest of the crews being slaughtered by the sentinel machines.  Neo, as well as his fellow shipmates Morpheus and Trinity, also have to come to grips with the fact that the entire prophesy concerning 'The One' may have been a lie - that it was another layer of control used by the machines over humans.  Zion itself had been destroyed 5 times prior to this current threat, consequently there have been 5 prior 'Ones'.<br />In the third installment, Neo has completely gone from a computer-hacker gone vigilante superhero, to a Christ-like messiah for humanity, even being referred to as 'Savior'.  (In one scene taking place in the real world, he walks towards the machine city - the light images shown resemble that of a man walking on water.  Hmmmmm....  with that in mind, Neo's fate was pretty easy to guess long before the release of this movie.)  He finally comes to terms with what it is he must do in order to have any meaningful impact on this war and to save mankind.  Trinity, after showing much heart and determination in rescuing the love of her life from his torn state, goes along with him to the Machine City.  Along the way they do battle with Bane (Agent Smith), and our hero is blinded. (His response: \\"Trinity, you're gonna have to drive.\\")  That's pretty much all you see of Neo and Trinity until Neo's climactic showdown with Agent Smith at the end...  a huge chunk of the movie passes by and they are nowhere to be found on the screen.  This is probably the one aspect that I felt should've been done better, as their story (aside from Neo being the main focal point of the entire series) of love together added the only real 'human emotional touch'.  <br />The majority of the film takes place in the 'real world'... not the Matrix, where all of the cool fighting usually takes place.  The city is buckling down and getting ready for the impending attack from the machines.  (The expanded roles of Zee, Niobe and others from the 2nd film was welcome.)  The sentinel attack on the city is nothing short of phenomenal, a seamless fusion of real-life and CGI action that lasts for a good while, but doesn't seem to just linger on like the shorter but less-effective Neo vs. Smith clones fight marathon in 'Reloaded'. <br />Meanwhile, back in the Matrix, Agent Smith is growing stronger by the second, and is threatening to completely destroy the computer-generated world altogether.  The final fight sequence between he and Neo is exceptional, if not familiar.  Smith is MUCH stronger than before, and even shares Neo's ability to fly.  The majority of this anticipated showdown takes place in the air. (kinda corny, if you ask me... but effective anyway.)<br />In the end, we are teased with the possibility that this may not be the last we see/hear of The One.  Seemingly taking the most simplistic route for drawing things to a conclusion, the 'W' Brothers may have upset some followers.  In a way, I find it fitting that so many people spent so much time/energy hypothesizing what would take place next and how it would all end - with all kinds of finely-detailed theories and philosophical overtones, when in the end it may have been the easiest route that everyone had in the back of their minds all along.<br />In the end, I give this entire series a A-.<BR>(The Matrix - A<BR>The Matrix: Reloaded - B<BR>The Matrix: Revolutions - B+<br />This trilogy belongs up there with the all-time greats.  Time will tell.
B00005JKC3|2.0|What a disappointment! The dialogue was weak, the story was boring and frankly absurd. Can't believe talented actors like Nolte and Connelly actually got through this film. <BR>I read that this was supposed to be deep- so what does deep mean we're talking about a guy who becomes a green giant when he gets mad and goes on a serious temper tantrum. <BR>There are no words to describe how awful this was. <BR>Haven't seen anything this bad since the first Star Trek film.<BR>I love a good drama but this didn't even have the elements to make it one and it obviuosly wasn't a typical action movie. <BR>SO what was it?<BR>I thought Crouching Tiger was an exceptional movie but this didn't even seem like it was done by the same person. <BR>Don't waste your time with this one. <BR>A disappointing offering from a very talented director...
B000089RVR|5.0|This CD proves without a doubt that Dido is a serious musician.  Her music is a deep expression of emotion and it takes time to &quot;say what she wants to say.&quot;  So this time around the wait is worth it because she's saying things she didn't get to say on &quot;No Angel&quot;.  &quot;White Flag&quot; is a great song with emotion and great lyrics.  &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is too.  Other songs on this CD that are good are &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;, &quot;Do You Have A Little Time&quot;, and the hidden track that plays right after &quot;See The Sun&quot;, called &quot;The Closer You Get&quot;.  I recommend this CD to anyone who really enjoys music for music, not for some cheap sing a long or great guitar player.  Dido is an artist with music and this is a very entertaining collection of songs.  Buy it!
0066620996|1.0|I had to read this book for my university and write an essay on it.  If I were to write an essay on this book it would sound too offensive and degrading to Jim Collins.  I think this book is absolute crap.  So many Americans are in love with it though.  I have made notes on nearly every page where he contradicts himself over and over just to make one company sound better than another.  Anyone could write this book and abuse data the way Collins does.  Save your money and time.
B000000WF0|5.0|Without a doubt this is one of the greatest albums of the 90's, if not one of the greatest of all time. I was shamefully late in scratching beneath the surface of the Verves more obvious singles, but listening to Urban Hymns changed my outlook on music altogether. Plain and simple. It is a collection of some of the deepest and most painfully honest records ever made, one would be forgiven for thinking that the rest of the album would be pale in comparison to the anthem of all anthems that kicks it off; Bitter Sweet Symphony. But not so. The Verve were a spark that burned brighter and stronger than they had any right to, its difficult to imagine the recording of this album as being anything other than a religious experience for all those involved. Whatever prices were paid emotionally and physically (we hear a lot about the problems such an intense process can cause a band) surely the result is worth it. BSS and 'The drugs dont work' (possibly the most acute translation of emotion into music?) are of course spellbinding, but looking beyond the singles the album contains other gems such as the beautiful &quot;Space &amp; Time&quot;, and the tripped out &quot;Catching the butterfly&quot;. The strength of character and self belief that the band always epitomised is present also with pure adrenalin rushes laid to tape in the form of &quot;The rolling people&quot; and &quot;Come on&quot;. Quite simply this is a collection of songs that compliment each other. Sit and listen to it all the way through, you'll feel like you've just lived all the highs and lows of life in the space of 70 minutes. You'll feel liberated and educated. Richard Ashcroft always said that history had a place for the Verve and despite the shocking lack of recognition they gained from 'Storm in Heaven and 'A Northern soul' this album really does ensure that this prophecy is fulfilled. This is the album that defines what music should be, and what it should do to you, created and written from the heart of a band that belong to a higher order of being. You've got to love it like your own child.
0385504209|5.0|This is a rock solid book, filled with historical facts, trivia, and information.  Beautifully written, grips one from the first few pages and doesn't let go till the end!  I recommend this to anyone with an open mind.
B0000C4GQV|5.0|It was a nailbiting few weeks before the realease of this album. I was really scared that Machine Head didnt learn their lesson with Supercharger and that i would be disgusted all over again. I was still hoping that my love for this band and knowing that they have the ability to be absolutely superb, would pull it through......and they SO did!! I must say, Phil Demmel was probably the best decision MH made in the past few years and his involvement delivered probably the best album of the band's career. TTAOE has the heaviness of Burn My Eyes and The More Things Change and the more diverse and melodic touch of The Burningred and for the first time Machine Head was able to combine all these factors into one album and let me tell you it's HUGE! The guitars will take your breath away, that combined with amazing vocals by Flynn and equally good harmonising and kick ass melodies, as heared in songs like \\"Days turn Blue to Gray\\", brings the familiar Machine Head feel back - something that has been missing for a while and something a lot of fans were worried were lost forever! Imperium is a classic opener and i suppose it was MH's way of giving a  \\"F#%$ YOU VERY MUCH!!!\\" to all their critics over the past few years and giving all the listeners an introduction that makes Davidian sound like a Christmas Carol! There are numerous songs on this album that bring back MH to their roots, with the fast, bone crunching guitars to what has to be Dave McClain's best performance on drums in his entire career (the doulbe bass on VIM is amazing). <br />The thing im most pleased about is that the guys really thought long and hard on the mistakes they made in the past few years and to have such an amazing come back deserves a pat on the back!! Weldone Robb, im sure you didnt only recruit a TON of new fans but you made those who doubted you and who got lost along the way come back to the Machine Head of old....pity theres only 10 songs on the album.
B000002UEB|5.0|Needless to say this is the album that got me into Queensryche, and IMHO, the finest heavy metal recording I've ever heard! When you break it all down, music, lyrics, production, it's just brilliant. The story itself centers around a youth who becomes caught up in an underground movement to assasinate political and religious leaders. There are a few political overtones, but generally the whole thing deals with psychological manipulation through the media, religion, and drugs. The songs just flow perfectly from one to the next adding a really good visual feel to what's going on.  Geoff Tate is just at the top of his game proving why he's always been one of rock's great vocalists. The chemistry between Wilton and DeGarmo is just perfect.  What I think sometimes goes a little unnoticed but strikes me more than anything is Scott Rockenfield's performance. Following in the footsteps of Neil Peart and John Bonham, his work on this album is really amazing. Tracks such as Suite Sister Mary, Anarchy-X, and Spreading the Disease come to mind.  All in all this is a great album to start your q.r. collection and really shows you why they coined the phrase &quot;thinking man's metal&quot;.
1400086035|5.0|A Christmas Carol Audiobook<br />read by Jim Dale<br />I once heard it said that to appreciate Dickens best, one should read his stories aloud. I have never had the time to try to do this, but having just listened to a new unabridged reading of A Christmas Carol from Random House, I can see the validity of the statement. Playing the CD's I felt as if the narrator was, in the words of Dickens himself, &quot;standing in the spirit at your elbow.&quot;<br />And what a narrator! The multi-talented Jim Dale reads the story...no, that is not correct...Jim Dale PERFORMS the story. I counted 42 voices in the three-hour recording. Jim Dale is well known for his over 200 voices (and counting) bringing to life all of the characters in the Harry Potter books, which he also records for Random House's Listening Library.<br />I first saw Jim Dale in the 1977 Disney movie Pete's Dragon where he played the bumbling villain. The next year he played three hilarious characters in another Disney film, Hot Lead and Cold Feet. I was lucky to see him in two musicals on Broadway, in Barnum, and Me and My Girl. Both very memorable performances. I plan to see him next month as he sings and dances Scrooge in Madison Square Garden's Christmas Carol - The Musical. I figure if he is great in the audiobook, he will be even better on stage. An actor has only two tools...his voice and his body. In the audiobooks, of course, only the voice can be used.<br />And Dale's voice talents are well showcased here. I often found myself laughing out loud, thanks to the combined genius of Dickens and Dale. In a couple of cases, the genius is pure Dale. At one point he adds a bit of a dog's panting that really cracked me up.<br />I have seen and/or heard other wonderful actors do one-man renditions of A Christmas Carol. A number of years ago a friend played a tape for me of John Gielgud doing an abridged version. I saw Patrick Stewart do his acclaimed one man show on Broadway; from the first row! And I have seen the author's great-great grandson, Gerald Dickens do his skilled and energetic version several times. They are all memorable and it would be impossible to say which was the best. But I can heartily recommend that Jim Dale's version be added to the family library. It is complete, it is accurate and it is a virtuoso performance.<br />Although I certainly know the story well, I found by listening to the audiobook I was paying closer attention to the lesser known parts...the parts that, to be honest, I usually would skim over when rereading the book. In fact, there were several sections where I felt as if I were hearing them for the first time. Marvelous sections. I couldn't believe I had missed them in the past. Maybe Jim Dale's voice just made them more vibrant than my own inner voice.<br />I suppose that asking me to review Jim Dale reading A Christmas Carol really isn't fair. One of my favorite performers reading my favorite story by my favorite author! But surely I am not alone. Dickens is universally known as England's greatest novelist. I wouldn't be surprised if Jim Dale was gaining a reputation as one of the world's greatest readers of audiobooks.  They are both master storytellers. And to quote the Dickens himself, &quot;If that's not high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it.&quot;n the author's great-great grandson, Gerald Dickens do his skilled and energetic version several times.

0066214122|4.0|All right. You are a computer scientist/programmer. You made the Predprey system. Chrichton looks at every aspect of losing a job, and having 2 kids. Brutal. Then, as if to add more stress to the bundle, your wife is wearing clothes you never thought she would wear.

1558908455|5.0|Having trouble finding a good vampire flick that's exciting and scary?  Looking for something that doesn't abide by regular horror genera rules?  &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; may be the one to choose.  With a sizzling screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and perfectly directed by Robert Rodriguez, this is a horror/thriller to remember.<br />The Gecko brothers are two extremely violent criminals who end up taking a family hostage. The family is forced to drive the notorious brothers to the end of the border.  They end up making a pit stop at a Mexican bar, where the brothers are supposed to meet their contact.  However, things get out of hand when it turns out that the place is contaminated with vampire strippers and truckers.  You add all of those elements together and you get one hell of a ride that you'll never forget.<br />I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, but I thought this was an EXCELLENT movie.  It's unpredictable and exhilarating.  You have no idea where the movie will take you until it's all said and done.  This is not your ordinary vampire flick, and that's what makes this movie so great.  It's a breath of fresh air and so much more.<br />The acting really makes the movie what it is.  George Clooney gives a remarkable performance (this was before he was the big star that he is today).  Quentin Tarantino does a great job of contributing dark and chaotic humor to the film with his role.  Other major players include Harvey Keitel, Juliet Lewis, Cheech Marin and plenty more.  The screenplay by Tarantino is great and never misses a beat.  It's packed with snappy dialogue that one would not expect to hear in a horror movie.  Rodriguez does an exceptional job of directing as well.<br />I don't have the fully loaded version of the movie, so I am stuck with the plain version for now.  The picture quality looks pretty good, considering that it isn't enhanced for widescreen TVs.  The sound is really lacking, though.  I had to keep fumbling around with the volume controls throughout the movie, as it kept going from being quiet to extremely loud.  That might be reason enough to get the Collector's Edition of the film.  A theatrical trailer and teaser trailer are both included on the DVD, but those are the only extra features you'll find on this DVD version.<br />&quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; is a wildly entertaining flick that really stands out from the others.  It has some extremely funny moments, as well as some very scary and exciting sequences.  This movie pretty much has it all.  If you're looking for a horror/thriller movie that isn't like the rest, give this one a try.

B000024D4R|5.0|This is quite simply my favorite Pink Floyd album, David Gilmour's guitar fills the album as opposed to the mostly synth/saxophone solos in Dark side of the moon and wish you were here, this album is simply amazing.  I should've bought it a long time ago, every song is perfect but I think my favorite is &quot;Dogs&quot; because it starts out fast and then in the middle goes to a slower tempo and just is filled with an atmospheric feeling that u just can't describe, 1977 had some good albums but i think animals is the best.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|How was that after this album the band broke up?<BR>They were getting a very big band at that moment. Well, at least they gave us a wonderful collection of classic songs to enjoy. The sound and the feeling of the band in this record are simply incredible. The highest points of the album are &quot;Only you can rock me&quot;,&quot;Natural thing&quot;(this live version is much better than the recorded in studio),&quot;Lights out&quot;, &quot;Too hot to handle&quot; and of course &quot;Rock bottom&quot;. One of the best Hard rock albums ever.
B00005R2BG|2.0|I saw this movie on DVD last night and I don't think that it was all that great as other people have commented on it. First I could not understand why they didn't come up with original music, they had to borrow from &quot;The Sound of Music.&quot; Are they kidding? Diamonds are Girl's Best Friend? And when did rap come in to play in the 1900's? The camera action was so fast I had to go in to slow play to see what I had missed.<BR>I had to turn the volume up to hear what the actors were saying<BR>and then when the music came on it was so loud and I had to turn it down. Actors should take alocution lessons and learn to project their lines so we can understand what they are saying. And as for their singing, Nicole and Ewan sounded like two wimps.<BR>Well others may like it, but I am from the old school when musicals were made to be entertaining and the voices could be heard.
B00004NJJQ|4.0|El primer album de UFO con Schenker es una buena manera de conocer esta banda. Ya muestra parte de su potencial aunque el resultado no es del todo perfecto debido a algunas canciones mejorables. La produccion tampoco es la mejor que han tenido. Canciones como &quot;Crystal light&quot; o &quot;Space child&quot; restan puntos al album. Pero otras como las impresionantes &quot;Doctor doctor&quot; y &quot;Rock bottom&quot; lo convierten en un clasico. A destacar tambien el precioso instrumental &quot;Lipstick traces&quot;, del cual Schenker siempre se ha mostrado orgulloso.
B000084T18|2.0|50 Cent doesnt have that much talent what so ever in rapping. I have no idea why hes so popular, there are only a few good songs on this CD which are probaly In Da Club because its catchy, P.I.M.P. because it has a good beat, and Patiently Waiting because Eminem is in it. If you listen to 50 he has no flow or rythym and hes just boring, unlike Ludacris or Eminem who bring style into their songs and sound different in all their songs. 50 has no good dance beats on this CD so I am puzzled on why this guy is so big maybe people will learn. O yeah he didn't get shot 9 times its all part of his big tough guy from the hood image.
B00003OO3O|5.0|What a collection of classic songs...The second album of UFO with Schenker really catches the essence of the group. On important thing here is the pressence of the Rhodes piano which makes a great accompaniment to the guitar.<br />Great riffs: &quot;let it roll&quot;, &quot;shoot shoot&quot;, &quot;this kids'&quot;<br />Amazing solos: &quot;high flyer&quot;,&quot;Out in the streets&quot;(maybe the best song)<br />And the great work of Way(bass) and Parker(drums) in &quot;Dance your life away&quot;.
B00005JM02|5.0|I have loved what animators can do ever since I was a young child watching reruns of Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, &amp; a plethora of movies ranging from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Cool World, and of course, Ice Age, The Lion King, et al.<br />By far, Finding Nemo is one of the hardworking CGI (computer animation as opposed to hand-drawn) movies since Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (a fully realized world based loosely on the video game series, albeit with no controller and a story that was so-so) that really impressed me, both visually and storywise.<br />The movie opened around Memorial Day 2003 and at the time, I was interested in &quot;The Matrix Reloaded.&quot; Finding Nemo was an afterthought, however in this world I have found that a persons first thought is not always the best. But maybe we need them to appreciate the &quot;sleeper&quot; things, such as this adorable movie for people of any age.<br />I love Widescreen movies best, however, for this movie, the Fullscreen version provides more of a complete enjoyment. Set mostly underwater, you're transported to a fantasy world without prophecies of computers wiping us out in a computer program, no evil-eyed Terminator's, no bad boys blowing up things for shock value, and most importantly -not a second of wasted time.<br />The DVD is hitting the market at just the right time, and in the right edition. What I mean by that is, Thanksgiving and the Christmas season is upon us and it's time for family. Finding Nemo is assured to please any age and whether you silently want to despise the movie, you'll give in to rejoicing with it. At least I did, thus, it was an afterthought to see the movie at all. Why I waited having loved animated movies, I don't know. All I can come up with is that I bought into the hype of the summer sequels, which left me flummoxed at best.<br />The DVD extra's are done just right, not overwelming, not intrusive or boring, but filled with educational value and a great behind-the-scenes look at how this movie came about, and also, how it was animated. Grab your family and curl up for a timeless and classic movie that deserves to sit next to the best.at how this movie came about, and also, how it was animated.

B00005JKJA|3.0|It's been said there's often a thin line between pretention and genius, and the director comes perilously close to crossing the line ten times over. The dream sequences, the idea of 'No hay banda', the lesbian activity...all pulled from the mess of hollywood cliches and thrown together into the weird psychological film, 'Mulholland Drive'.<br />If you have a night to sit down and work out the actual line of events, the storyline, and what the hell the blue box symbolises, this is a very good film indeed. For light entertainment, you'd do better sitting in a dark room, hitting yourself with the DVD box.<br />The pretention of the film distinctly put me off: I found the lack of meaning in some of the weird scenes irritating, difficult to follow and generally disappointing. Equally I found the representation of her ego (the two old parents), the huge culmination and some of the more simple ideas excellently portrayed and very enjoyable indeed.<br />A film that stray from the sublime to the ridiculous, that ends too late or prematurely, that is a mixture of genius and pretention; that is Mulholland Drive.<br />Enjoy if you will!
B00005JMFR|5.0|The Matrix Trilogy is an art-form of the structure and dynamics of consciousness.  Based on my own 10 years of research on the \\"Geometrical Structure of Consciousness\\" (email me at THENINTHLEVEL57@YAHOO.COM to learn more) using math and observation, the movie near perfectly (in art form) describes consciousness.<br />Don't fool your self.  If someone didn't like the movie, it is not for any other reason than that it scares them.  Someone who can appreciate the movie and understand it may have achieved a level of consciousness; continued on with their \\"path\\".  Those who don't like the movie and cannot understand it feel threatened by the movie because it incites feelings of guilt for losing their soul and \\"way\\" many years ago.  They are lost souls like the \\"vampires\\" and \\"werewolves\\" in Reloaded.<br />You can't blame them...to lose your path and stop developing in consciousenss means stupidity, igonorance, blindness, repression, shallowness, arrogance, etc., and movies, they believe, should arouse their genitals, not their mind (they probably stopped day dreaming during \\"orgy\\" in Reloaded.<br />This is a quite a psychological observation, those who report their liking or not of the Matrix.  You have (1) those who like the movie because they achieved a level of consciousness and are following their path; (2) those who despise the movie  (come on, 1 star?) because it reminds them of what they lost in the past and know they cannot get back (they commited metaphysical suicide); or (3) those who love the movie because THEY are lost but haven't given up on the search -- they are not bitter yet.<br />I am surprised to see so many DID like the movie.  You had to think and it required a level of intelligence and experience to even enjoy or see the movie...as far as I am concerned the rest can just continue to watch the \\"Telli Tubbies\\".<br />Brian Woodward, Ph.D.

B0000C8AVR|5.0|I'd admit it, I was skeptical.  I didn't think that the SACD treatment of any of Dylan's catalogue would sound much different than the digitally remastered analog recordings we've been listening to for years.  Boy, was I wrong.<br />From the opening crack of \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" I knew the SACD was money well spent.  The piano on the opening track, once hidden and muddy, now adds a whole new color to this classic.  Bob's harmonica screams with crystal clarity, carrying much more power than ever before.  \\"Tombstone Blues\\" propels Michael Bloomfield's wild guitar licks right into the depths of your skull.  Harvey Goldstein's bass work is clear, imaginative, and amazing.  <br />I could go on and on about every tune on this classic disc, but I couldn't finish this review without mentioning the brilliant \\"Desolation Row,\\" one of Dylan's all-time greats.  You could write a dissertation on the lyrics of this song, but with the SACD treatment, the guitar playing comes alive in a beautiful way, adding another dimension to this mind-blowing masterpiece.  <br />Just for the record, I have a regular CD player, and I must say the difference in SACD sound will blow your socks off.  But I warn you: After listening to one SACD, you're going to want them all.  And it'll be worth it.  <br />TOTAL TIME: 51:32
B00005JMFR|4.0|bFirst off I am a huge Matrix Fan and so is the family. I saw Revolution 1st day 1st show with my wife while on vacation in Daytona. I wasn't dispointed. Whereas my wife was. My Daughter who saw it this week ( Because we wouldn't tell her about the movie) called us with a big headach. Saying the movie was confusing. There is an ongoing debate in my house about the ending, left 2 many things unanswered. If you look at the reviews on this board they pretty much mirror my household.<br />My Question to them is what did you expect? How would you have wanted it to end? How would you have crafted the ending. Or are all of you disappointed because this is the last in the sequel.<br />Story line was good, CGI incredible and the fight scenes were outstanding.<br />Finally 2 things the movie creates lots of conversation/debate and I can't wait until the \\"The Revolution\\" comes out on DVD so I can have the Matrix movie night.<br />How boring is That?<br />PS: Challenge to all the disappointed. How would you have crafted the Ending?
B00005JMFR|2.0|I will make it short and sweet, this movie absolutely sucked.I mean compared to the 1st movie which was awesome,and reloaded was fair,but this had no point ,no story and the ending,what the hell was that?

Off. <BR>Because this spoiled little rich Boy, this spoiled Brat who has Parents. Parents that care. Parents that returned from Tokyo. Just to make sure their bad spoiled Boy gets the Care he needs. In the Hospital. For which they spend much Money. They have spent Money on him before. How do I know? I know. <BR>I know. <BR>Because. <BR>He tells us.<BR>He says: I am an Alcoholic. I am a Criminal, &amp; I have been an Addict. And an Alcoholic. For 10 years. Since I was 13. <BR>But this spoiled Boy spent at least 4 of those Years. At least 4, he tells us. In College. College where he met a beautiful Girl. A beautiful Girl who loved him too. Even tho he was an Addict. And an Alcoholic. And who paid for the Boy to be in College to meet the Girl while he was an Alcoholic? His Parents. His loving Parents who cry. But love him. Even when he smokes Crack. Even when he sniffs Glue. Even when he jumps Bail. His Parents love Him and cry. And pay. <br />And this Boy has Friends. Friends who call the Brother. Friends who care if the Boy gets well. Friends who visit on Sundays, bearing Gifts. Friends who don't want to see the Boy walking bare-assed around the Hospital. Which his Parents are paying for.<br />Some Addicts don't have Loving Parents. Some addicts don't have Friends who care about them &amp; come visit on Sundays. Some Addicts had to spend their time in the Hospital walking around bare-assed because no one cared. Cared if they had clothes. Cared if they had toothpaste. Cared if they lived. Cared if they died. <br />Some Addicts didn't have the luxury of 4 Years of College. Some Addicts didn't get to party while the Loving Parents paid for it. Some Parents don't cry.

Only, you don'thave any Friends to tell this to. No one to hug you while you cry. No one to push away because you feel Vulnerable. No one. Period.<br />So, spoiled James Frey, cry. Cry for what a Bad Boy you are. Cry because your Mama cried for you. Cry because you are an Addict and a Criminal. Just remember while you cry: some Addicts never had no crying Mama. Some Addicts can get clean without. Sturm. Und. Drang. Some Addicts have to do it. All by themselves. Because. No one cared.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Now I have seen the entire trilogy, and I can successfully render my opinion of it- \\"The Matrix\\" did not need any sequels.  The trilogy doesn't exactly end with a whimper for \\"Matrix Revolutions\\", but let's just say I was not sad to see it end.  The film looks great, there are some terrificly tense scenes, and not too many loose threads are left hanging, but the thrill is leaving.  There's just not as much sense of awe anymore.  It's time to call it quits for \\"The Matrix\\" series.<br />There are some great things about \\"Revolutions\\".  The siege of Zion was one of the most impressive sights I've ever seen in a film.  The action throughout is very competently done.  Every frame of the screen is filled with detail, every texture is vividly rich.  There are some very tense moments, such as the aforementioned Zion battle and when Neo and Trinity take on the Machine City.  Seraph and Niobe are given some nicely extended roles.  Hugo Weaving is still terrific as Agent Smith.  And even the Oracle's replacement actress- Mary Alice for the late great Gloria Foster- is charismatic and mysterious.  These are all the things I liked about \\"Revolutions\\", and these moments hint at the just how great the first film was.<br />However, I couldn't help but be disappointed with it all.  One of the main problems was that I was honestly indifferent to almost everything- there's little emotional core to \\"Revolutions\\".  The supposedly emotional and sad moments are not handled well by the directors- they had just a slightly higher impact on me than George Lucas' dialogue in \\"Attack of the Clones\\".  This was not one of the movie's strong areas.  I was not a fan of \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", but I cared more about what happened to the characters in that film than I do this one.<br />I mentioned in my review of \\"Reloaded\\" that I wanted to know more about the Merovingian and his role in the whole thing.  I take it back- he returns in this film, and this time he's downright irritating.  The Architectonly has a cameo and we learn little else about him.  And those omnipresent Agents that were so sinister in the first film?  Sorry, they don't even show up this time outside of Smith.<br />And the ending?  Let's just say they could not have been less obvious in the symbolism- I almost giggled at some points.  Unfortunately, this doesn't really add to the emotional impact and sometimes makes the whole thing seem downright ridiculous.  Most things are resolved and explained (albeit in a contrived way), but just enough is left hanging to leave the door open for more sequels.<br />I honestly hope this does not happen.  With the coming of \\"Revolutions\\", it's becoming obvious that the Matrix's time is passing.  \\"Revolutions\\" will not send the franchise out on a high note, but at least it will save it from the doom of becoming boring and repetitive, which is what \\"Matrix IV\\" may do to it.

B000068PQ0|5.0|This is simply a rare, wierd and wonderful album. On its surface it is about a Japanese girl battling the evil pink robots, but at its cotton candy center it is a beautiful meditation on life, happiness, and taking chances. Every song in its unique way makes a profound statement on the everyday beauty that most music these days fails to express. Every number is a great achievement, particularly &quot;Fight Test,&quot; &quot;Are You A Hypnotist,&quot; and the gorgeous &quot;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell.&quot; Pick up this album now so you could enjoy the best album of recent years.

The fish in the dentist's office were hillarious, along with those pelicans and those penguin-type birds.

0671004107|5.0|If you thought the movie was great, do yourself a giant favor and put this at the top of your reading list. Sagan's novel is light years better than its film counterpart.<br />The writing, concepts, and characters are so wonderful I forgot this was Science Fiction I was reading. Even though I thought I knew the story from the movie (there are some big differences), I got wholly caught up in the excitement and possibilities. I really didn't want this one to end.<br />An excellent touch presented by Sagan is the inclusion of quotations from a multitude of diverse sources at the beginning of each chapter. The persons and characters quoted are a well rounded group and really give a terrific perspective to the ideas presented in the novel.<br />Perspective is what this novel is about. Though written more than 15 years ago, Contact is still very contemporary--especially during a time when it's difficult and even painful to see hope in our world. In this novel you can take delight again in being human. You come away feeling like a kid again.<br />Highest accolades to this work--one of the best novels I've ever read.
6302752337|4.0|By the mid-60s, the traditional movie audience had changed from a middle-aged, high school-educated, middle-to lower-class viewing group to a younger, college-educated, more affluent, middle-class audience. This is the movie that revolutionized and redirected the industry by proving that phenomenal returns could be made from a modest investment, if it appealed to its new audience, as well as launching an interest in producing youth-cult pictures. At a glance, Easy Rider appears to be and has the charm of a cheaply made underground flick seeking to exploit the iridescent youth movement. Well it was cheaply made, as far as money goes, costing a meek $350,000, but it returned $60 million worldwide. It was the first independent film to be distributed by a major company, Columbia, and it remains one of the most vital additions to film history because it best articulated the angst and energies of this alienated mass we call the counter-culture.<BR>     <BR>Directed by Dennis Hopper, produced by Peter Fonda, and starring both as two shaggy haired, reefer-reveling vagabonds inhaling the southwestern countryside atop their motorcycles, an excursion financed by an earlier cocaine deal, the movie is fueled by a caustic, equally rebellious soundtrack. Indeed, the first half hour seems more like a continuous rock video, commenced by the ultimate road song, Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild. They leave L.A., headed for Mardi Gras, and pass through various towns, a hippie commune, and the boundless, sun drenched American landscape, but also through areas where local residents are increasingly narrow-minded and hateful of their longhaired freedom and use of drugs. Watch as Fonda casts away his wristwatch in the beginning, a symbol of an inner escape from the constraints and complexities of modern living. The title also points to our anti-heroes' rootless natures, who's capricious decision to discover their world directs them to the road's infinite freedom.   <BR>     <BR> There's an interesting distinction to be made between Fonda's and Hopper's characters. Fonda plays the cool and introspective &quot;Captain America&quot; Wyatt astraddle a gleaming, low-riding bike with a 'stars-and-stripes' tear-drop gas tank, clad in tight leather pants and a black leather jacket with an American flag emblazoned on the back. Fonda said he actually soaked in a tub while wearing these pants, striding around in them afterwards until they had dried to give them the worn appearance. Hopper is the mustached, longhaired Billy, with a tan-colored bush hat, fringed buckskin jacket, and an Indian necklace of animals' teeth. Their names refer, of course, to the Western legends of Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid, and this is indicative of their personalities. Wyatt is quiet, more mature, and content with any surrounding; the jive-spouting Billy is restless and easily irritated. It's easy to imagine these drifters instead as idealistic gunslingers trotting across the immortal, sun-dried West, seeking out the untarnished American Dream in a corrupt, conformist environment. A quote from the coarsely brilliant George Carlin comes to mind, who wrote \\"The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it.\\" As our exploration of the great civilization deepens into the bowels of the bigoted paranoia of the South, this becomes increasingly manifest. <BR>     <BR>Relish also Jack Nicholson in the performance that made him a star. After a decade or so of anonymity, he was contemplating giving acting up - lucky for him, and us, he did not. Playing the part of the jovial, rustic, and alcoholic lawyer, George Hanson, a part originally intended for Rip Torn, our hippie friends discover him in a jail after a night of obvious, though unstated, inebriation. He joins Wyatt and Billy on their quest and is bludgeoned to death one night as they camp in a forest on the outskirts of a terribly prejudiced, volatile Southern town. Think about what this represents:George, while he shares their longing for escape, is the least like Wyatt and Billy - he doesn't dress like them, doesn't speak their lingo, and doesn't have a shaggy mane. Even his addiction to alcohol seems to separate him even further from this equation - grass was a substance whose popularity belonged to the youth; alcohol was a more ancient addiction. So in him, we have a combination of both liberal and conservative values, in whose death the distinction between those dedicated to the rebellion (Wyatt and Billy) and those who're only innocent concomitants (George) diminishes. The locals are sort of killing a native son. Pay attention to what George tells Billy in campfire palaver: <br />      \\"They're scared of what you represent to 'em (freedom)... But talkin' about it and bein' it - that's two different things. I mean, it's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. 'Course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free 'cause then they're gonna get real busy killin' and maimin' to prove to you that they are. Oh yeah, they're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom, but they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em.\\" <br />Really, a fascinating picture. Once you get through Hopper's esoteric directorial methods and the rambling, improvisational nature of the script, I think its greater message will truly affect your viscera.
B000002J2E|5.0|In theory, Steve Hackett's departure was expected to negatively affect the band, but it didn't. A highly controversial album, yet is beautifully crafted and performed. In my opinion, this is Genesis' most soulful and melodic release, courtesy mainly of Tony Banks' beautiful keyboard orchestration.  The compositions, arrangements, interpretation and lyrics are of the highest caliber. I re-discovered And Then There Were Three many years after its release, and to my surprise, I found out this album to be one of Genesis' best, both musically and lyrically. Oddly enough, my least favorite track here is the most commercially known (Follow You), as the other songs, when slowly digested, have many different and interesting things to offer.     This is not The Lamb, Selling England, et al... and it is definitely not the blatant sellout of the band's post-releases. This is simply highly inspired music, so well crafted and innovative. I challenge hardcore Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett's aficionados to really listen to this album and to finally give credit where is due.
B000002H2Z|5.0|Whenever I'm mourning the death of our old friend, Good Music, I just slap any Cure CD onto the disc player. The Cure is the definitive \\"80s and beyond\\" band. Their mercurial pop melodies mingled with singer Robert Smith's Poe-meets-Rimbaud-meets-Dr. Seuss lyrical musings and plaintive wail make The Cure a truly mesmerizing presence. All of its albums are stunningly solid efforts, including the recent \\"Bloodflowers,\\" but 1985's \\"Head on the Door\\" is its most intriguingly layered offering, serving up an experimental foray into various musical styles; bits of flamenco, Japanese new wave, funk, hard rock, and even jazz sneak their way onto this magical album. The best part is, the Cure manages all the musical genre-melding without surrendering its trademark surrealistic sound.
B00005JMFR|4.0|I found Matrix Reloaded to be thoroughly engrossing.  The feeling the movie generates (albeit a little heavy on the cliche war movie side) is so deep, so impactful, that I found myself dealing with the largest disappointment only upon leaving the theatre and realizing it was over.  The imagery of the movie is breathtaking, and while the acting is far from oscar material (Keanu, I love ya as Neo, but you could be out-acted by a inanimate carbon rod), it nevertheless pulls the movie through.  I especially liked the far more artistic and impactful manner the final neo-smith battle is executed in (I'm not ruining anything here... you KNEW they were going to fight) as \\"wire-fu\\" can only go so far before it plateaus on the excitement-meter.  While the movie does leave many questions unanswered, it ends the trilogy in an oddly satisfying and permanent manner.  I only hope that if there are ever any more matrix movies, they think hard about the idea before going forwards... the pure magic of this trilogy is a special thing, and I'd hate to see it go the way of batman (we ALL know what I'm talking about).  <br />This movie, in my opinion, is utterly forgiven for its faults.  Watch it for the art, immerse yourself in the story... and enjoy what it has to offer.  It offers quite a lot.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|After the first couple of listenings to Afterglow, I wondered what had happened to the Sarah of Fumbling.  As I listened more though, I realized that she was still there, just layered more in her music.  To those who have listened to this album and are unhappy, I provide the simple advice: give it time.  While I encourge anyone and everyone to listen to Fumbling first, I think Afterglow is a fine addition to Sarah's body of work.  Certainly \\"Stupid\\" and \\"Time\\" will join \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"Sweet Surrender\\" as some of my favorite songs.  <br />Whatever the case may be, it is nice to have a new album, and one that did not change her style completely (like some other recent artists).

I'm sure you will recognize most of the songs.
B00005JMFR|1.0|It disappoints me to say that The Matrix Revolutions is one of the worst films I have ever seen! I had high expectations for this film as it was the final installment in a franchise that I am a big fan of, but this film did not deliver on anything the first two films worked so hard to set up. Nothing is answered, the dialogue is cheesy and horribly written and the story is horrendous. This film makes the three main characters we love  (Neo,Trinity and Morpheus) and makes them supporting characters in their own stories. How can such an iconic character as Morpheus, portrayed by the best actor in the series, Laurence Fishburne,have nothing to do in the biggest war of his life? Why did the Wachowskis expect audiences to care about second rate characters with third rate dialogue in the final installment of a trilogy? It was not the best time for new characters to develop, if that is what you want to call it. There is harldy any of the famous action sequences that made the first film an instant classic and saved the second installment from being mundane. Outside of Mary Alice as the oracle and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, the performances were so wooden it made the performances in the last two Star Wars look Oscar-worthy. The film was boring, idiotic and a complete waste of time. This movie is a joke and so are the directors and producers for trying to make it sound like it was amazing. Don't see this film unless you like wasting money and time,because that is all the movie is.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I'll be honest here, if I had seen this film as an independent story from new material, I'd have given it five stars.  In essence I'm rating it here against the first film in the series.  The first film was nothing short of amazing, incredible visuals, standout characters, and truly &quot;boffo&quot; action sequences.  The reason for a letdown here is the characters were a bit forgotten. The majority of people I asked, and including myself came out of this film with the idea that the biggest standout character was Gollum.  &quot;Strange it is my precious&quot;, when the most notable character in an epic movie is an animated one!<br />I have to blame this on the direction.  While a difficult thing to do, a director must give the movie some focus, and enough intimate scenes with the characters. This is to keep from being over shadowed by the special effects, and epic battles. Perhaps it was bit too easy in the first movie having the interaction of Tolkiens &quot;Fellowship&quot;, to give the characters focus.  I'll admit that since you have groups of characters spread in many different locations, it is nearly impossible to accomplish a good focus on each group. Yet, the Gollum character seemed to accomplish it.  Perhaps by asking for a bit more &quot;over the top&quot; performances we have been able to see the characters, over the roar of the epic battle scenes.<br />Along with Gollum, the battle sequences just made the movie.  Recent movies with big battle scenes such as the Aussie opuses, Braveheart, and The Gladiator, were actually dwarfed by the size, and scope of the battles seen here.  I didn't think film could ever contain the huge scope, and flow of the battles Tolkien described in his &quot;Rings&quot; novels, but movie proved me wrong!  The struggle depicted really made you think that the forces of evil, could indeed overrun, and control all of middle earth. It gave even more credence, to the mission of the ring bearer.  This was a great movie, I just couldn't rate it &quot;quite&quot; as good as the first.<br />Some notes on the DVD, I like the wide screen version because I don't like my epics to be cut.  I know some folk out there that complain they are missing content when it is wide screen, because of the bars on the top and bottom. It becomes hard to explain, that they are not really taking away any picture, they are just using less of your TV screen.  My response (usually takes people by surprise) is that TVs near future is watching it on HDTV and plasma screens. These sets have a wider aspect ratio than our current TVs. Would you want your future dvd showings to have the bars on the sides where you, &quot;really are&quot; missing content?<br />One final note, I am prepared to hate the final movie in this trilogy.  The reason is: like in the books, Tolkien understood that we the reader would know that the ring bearer would succeed somehow.  Which is probably why the ring is destroyed midway though the last book of the trilogy. Its rare when a book plays out it's ending into the life after the big climatic sequence.  Even though us as the reader usually wants to hear more of the story.  Tolkien did that, and did it successfully, by returning the Hobbits to the Shire, and having them use their &quot;battle tested strength&quot;, and &quot;bred from experience&quot; guile, to defeat yet another great evil.  I hope this will be included in the final film, but because of time constraints I have my doubts.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever watched.. It was far from the first one, the story is weak and unbelievable ... it does not have a contincency, action scenes are terrible .. the only good thing is for this movie is the fabolous Demi Moore.. One wonders what happened to the angels in time.. there was a scene between Drew and old angel from the series and you realized there, these angels simply won`t do, they are lack the beauty... especially Ms.Diaz....
B00005JMFR|5.0|This was easily the most action packed 3 hours ever! This is where they answer all the questions, they explain what Neo's purpose is, and then they fill in the time buy showing off some truly amazing special effects, and the greatest fight scene since Yoda's fight from Star Wars: Episode 2. Wow this was what I was hoping for, a big showdown. They were also realistic on how the machines and humans made peace, because there was no way that the small army of humans could have defeated the sentinel army. NONE WHAT SO EVER! So the first Matrix film introduced the characters and the situation, and the goal of the humans, the second one added more plot and more questions and was much more fast paced and allowed us to see samples of \\"the one's\\" power, and the third one gives us the biggest and coolest battle, possible in the hystory of cinema. I personally didn't think any of the matrix films were hard to follow or mentally stimulating, but I found them awesome! Yes there's opening for a Matrix 4, and I'm sure, even though they said they wouldn't, will make another to cash in and capitalize in the sucess, but then again who wouldn't?
B00005JMFR|1.0|They may as well give that title to the fourth in the series - if they dare to make one.  Lets hope this is it folks, because what started out as an awesomely creative and original premise in the first film has degenerated into one of the most boring, pretentious, cliche-ridden, overhyped pieces of Hollywood trash that I have ever seen.  The final entry is nothing more than an emptyheaded plop in a sea of nonsensical McDonalds mysticism, mixed up with a lot of overlong battle scenes that are obviously nothing more than an attempt to titillate the enormous mass of \\"gee-whiz\\" folk who will marvel at any and all explosions, kicks, and what-have-you.  I had hoped that this film would be an improvement over Reloaded (that wouldn't have been hard to pull off), but they topped themselves and made a last-ditch cookie-cutter attempt to maximize profits and jump ship.  I don't blame the Oracle (Gloria Foster) for passing on to the next world after Reloaded - maybe she had enough real life clairvoyance to bail before they could snag her into making this third stinker.  A great shame since the first film was so genuinely brilliant.  Luckily, the first film stands on its own - as it always will on my shelf!  Adios Wachowski brothers (lets hope!)
B000083E79|5.0|This has to be the most definitive collection that I have ever listened to. Following Cher since I was a child, she never failed to impress me, and through this collection, I can remember seeing her in those Bob Mackie costumes singing her heart out, thinking this is a true DIVA. This collection picks some of her best performances and is a delight to listen to.
B00003CWOL|5.0|while more than a few feathers were ruffled (not surprisingly because of the main topic at hand) this movie isn't about bashing religion... well, mostly not. in fact, i feel that the movie might even hold some kind of a revelation for one who questions faith.    kevin smith made such an amazing job as scriptwriter and director considering the gravity of the issue at stake (har har). how he manages to make a movie with a scion who lost her faith, the 13th apostle, 2 angels kicked out of heaven, a muse working as a stripper, 2 foul-mouthed prophets... it boggles the mind. and yet, it rings true as any church bell would. it's not a mega-budget blockbuster but a refreshing and honest look at what the regular joe might think about religion. so many things are said in the movie that are profound, yet never feels like it has been packaged neatly to be palatable like any feel-good disney flick.    personally, i can feel the insufferable pain both angels went through by being barred from the heavens. when bartleby looks into gods eyes... man, that scene was priceless -- even if i do not like ben affleck -- because it's something that any kid who ever wanted recognition from his or her parents, could connect with.    salma hayek was excellent as the .... muse, but i have to say my favorite character was alan rickman as metatron, the seraphim and Voice of God. he's a total riot, with his boundless sarcasm and wit. i ABSOLUTELY love, love, love him!    all in all, it's a really great flick that makes you think about the nature of religion, no matter what dogma you prescribe to, or not. it's about faith, and that is out of this world.    kevin smith proves that you don't need a lot of money to make a movie that's good and relevant,.
6301247485|1.0|If you've read the book, you know how amazing it is - with lots of symbols and puns,and great way of narrating the story, so it must be hard to make a good movie based on it.And this movie is not good at all. It's like some cheap romanse, and even worse, with this flat character of Daisy by Mia Farrow, who seems not to know the difference between &quot;acting&quot; and &quot;pretending&quot;.The rest is played not so bad,but Daisy made me so annoyed...I had to watch it at school,and that was the only reason for which I saw the whole film-otherwise I wouldn't make it to the end.The music is horrible,and the photographies - like those of lonely birds on the grass - made me want to commit a crime on the teacher for forcing me to look at something that disgusting.  <BR>So, my piece of advice - you better read the book than watch that crap,or you're gonna break down and never be the same again...
B00005JMFR|3.0|For one thing, see this movie now while it is in theatres. I am pretty sure all the mind-numbing action will not have half the effect when played off a DVD. For another, no point reading too many of the partisan reviews, The Matrix franchise never had the unanimous universal appeal badge after its first film.<br />But since this is a review, I need to offer my personal take.<br />The first Matrix, a fab concept executed with unprecedented  pizzazz, was a colossal hit because of its novel concept -- it let your mind ponder the extent of the concept. \\"Reloaded\\" dug into the story and complicated things further, which was a mixed bag as far as I am concerned, but still left me anticipating an ending I was sure would blow me away.<br />Having seen this third installment, I just feel gyped. I guess anyone who anxiously awaited this release will know exactly what I mean. It's almost like the Wachowskis sat down to review the first two movies and said, \\"Hey, too much character development and story. Now let's get down to the nitty gritty, and start shooting\\". There's more bazooka-toting characters here than you'd find in a crude Japanese anime, and the whole ambience is very hasty as if time was running out to rake in the dollars from the movie making.<br />So, personally, I am a bit disappointed and seek consolation in the knowledge that when the DVDs do become available as a Criterion trilogy or something, the first movie alone will carry the entire Matrix family.<br />Nevertheless, if you manage your expectations, this third part makes for some fast-action weekend popcorn if that's your thing.

B0000DJZBA|5.0|I agree with Michael Zoglio -- the exclusion of &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; is disappointing.  Chances are they had trouble clearing rights to footage from Terminator 2:  Judgment Day (which is now distributed by Artisan, I believe), which had been used liberally in the video, since the promotional value of &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; has long passed.  Too bad, because that was a great Guns N' Roses on-camera performance.<br />There's still tons of great music video filmmaking here.  &quot;Sweet Child O'Mine&quot; is a bare-bones performance video, but superior because it's free of the hyperactive post-modern techniques that characterize music videos today.  And I seem to remember the girl in the video is Axl's ex, Erin Everly, who had inspired the original song.  &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; is chaos incarnate, with Axl's prominent hairdo and psychotic performance sending the song over the top.  &quot;Patience&quot; has Slash's pet snake and Axl's subdued studio performance, &quot;Don't Cry&quot; began the band's experimentation with narratives in its videos, and of course &quot;November Rain&quot; is one of the greatest videos ever made, with a grand stage performance (Axl doing his Elton John, sitting at the piano with Roger McGuinn-flavoured 'granny' sunglasses) juxtaposed with beautifully shot narrative footage, and the dizzyingly gorgeous Stephanie Seymour.  The small moments in this video (Seymour licking wedding cake from Axl's finger, best man Slash losing the wedding ring) were beautiful to behold, and Slash's guitar solo outside a hilltop church is still rock n' roll at its most sweeping.<br />Guns N' Roses were one of the great on-camera performance bands of its time and this DVD release was long overdue.  Essential music-video viewing.

B0000DF3PN|4.0|I first fell in love with C&eacute;line's music from the early `80s when her songs were delightfully bubblegum-poppish (think Visa pour les beaux jours, Amoureuse, Je ne veux pas etc.), and now, listening back on that simpler era full of puppy love and upbeat tempos is a pleasant sort of C&eacute;line nostalgia, but I prefer the strong woman that C&eacute;line has become: accomplished performer, loving wife and mother, as I approach the same stage in my life. \\"1 fille &amp; 4 types\\" shows us again that C&eacute;line's mature talent and creativity have no bounds. She is relaxed, refreshed and radiant here, and this is quickly becoming my favourite C&eacute;line album of the last decade.<br />C&eacute;line returns triumphantly to the Francophone music arena with « 1 fille &amp; 4 types, » her first French album since 1998's S'il suffisait d'aimer. We find C&eacute;line with a new image: short-cropped, mussed hair, wearing a baby tee for Buff's Car Wash, looking older, wiser, and perhaps a bit edgier on the album's cover, surrounded by her four \\"guys\\" from the title: Jacques Veneruso, Erick Benzi, guitarist Gildas Arze and French superstar Jean-Jacques Goldman, who last collaborated with C&eacute;line on D'eux and S'il suffisait d'aimer.<br />The thirteen songs are woven from sheer poetic beauty, by turn gentle and pensive, declarations of love and loss and moving on. There are no belted love anthems here. C&eacute;line is at a point in her life that she brings gravity to the thirteen songs, makes the listener utterly entranced and hooked on each lyric (the songs were co-written by Goldman, Veneruso, and Benzi).<br />The songs occasionally evoke memories of earlier albums, such as Des Milliers de Baisers (Thousands of Kisses), with a drum intro reminiscent of Pour que tu m'aimes encore. As with D'eux, C&eacute;line and the gang experiment with different musical influences, such as a marked Irish rhythm and tinwhistles on Je Lui Dirai (I'll Tell Him), a touching declaration of C&eacute;line's love for her young son Ren&eacute;-Charles. Ne Bouge Pas (Don't Change) evokes Delta Blues with its saucy slide guitar and blues harp, backed by a gospel choir. The bonus song, Valse adieu (Farewell waltz), is a folksy, five-part harmony, with acoustic guitar, and is beautiful, but much too short at a minute and a half.<br />If you don't speak French, don't let that scare you off from experiencing this wonderful album. The emotions of the songs speak for themselves, although if you do speak French or are learning, dust off your dictionary to appreciate the beauty and simplicity of the French lyrics, which I consistently find to be more emotional and poetic than C&eacute;line's English albums. (Also, listening to music is an excellent way to accustom oneself to learning another language.) \\"1 fille &amp; 4 types\\" is C&eacute;line's most personal, touching work to date and a sure crowd-pleaser for music critics and C&eacute;line fans alike.

B00005JKC3|4.0|I didn't go to the theater to see this movie because I thought it was another one of those mindless, all special effects films like the new Star wars, so I rented it. I was very surprised, I actually liked this movie, it had a serious side with a main plot and the special effects were very good although too much CGI is not my thing. The hulk looked very good and the anger and destruction that followed were very well epicted. The hulk really show that exploding rage in his body language as well as the physical devastation caused by it. I did not like the mutated dogs (they looked too much like CGI) and the final fight against his father was over the top and somewhat cheesy. I rented the VHS version and the picture quality was so good that I could barely tell it apart from the dvd image, the sound was also top notch with excellent dynamics and clear dialogue. Overall: VERY GOOD.
B00005JLTM|2.0|The mark of a special effects driven film that has the unmistakable cachet of being memorable is a function both of how often it is viewed after its original release and whether it has elements other than special effects going for it.  These two marks are related in that long term critical and popular acclaim depend on their interaction.  With THE MATRIX RELOADED, the brother directors Wachowski try to build on the short term success of its prequel THE MATRIX.  In this latter film, they had reasonable success in postulating a world that was a simulation of its sleeping humans who were cared for by their machine masters.  This interesting philosophical underpinning combined with some startling special effects stamped THE MATRIX as a good, but not quite very good science fiction movie.  In this Part II, the brothers Wachowski flirt with, rather than delve into, the tension inherent in a world that was not all it seemed to be and a world fought over by unsleeping humans and attacking machine squid creatures.  When the very basis of the film's aesthetic core is hidden murkily by frequent glimpses of these tentacled devices that do little more than flop around on command, then what remains is a motivation that has nowhere to go.  On a stylistic level, this aimlessness of drive is matched by an equally aimless series of montages that feature gravity-defying leaps, elaborate martial arts bouts with no one getting hurt, and a freeway chase that looks more like computer-enhanced car crashes than a filmed set piece with real stunt drivers racing up and down in their equally real automobiles.  With all these unintegrated special effects, the result is to place the viewer in the uncomfortable position of trying to care about characters who seem fated never to suffer actual harm.  Even when co-star Carrie Moss, who as Trinity, gets shot by a slug that in other scenes no one had trouble dodging, her fate is as lackluster as that of the titular hero, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.Reeves plays Neo as some impossible combination of Superman and Jesus Christ.  Yet, his flying and resurrection abilities do not add up to a film populated by believable characters.  Not for one second in any of the film's interminable fight sequences did I believe that Reeves was in any mortal danger.  What this second in a projected trilogy boils down to is a film that is fun to watch, but as the viewer approaches mid-point, he begins to hope for something other than special effects to hook onto.  The early returns on the third movie, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, suggests that the Wachowski brothers are continuing the same dreary route that began with the second half of THE MATRIX.

B00005JMFR|3.0|First off, let me just say that this was a fun, popcorn-crunching, action movie. If I just let my mind sort of shut off, I loved watching all the big explosions, and lots (I mean really lots) of machine gun fire. I had fun. Now, I find myself wondering: is that really what I wanted to see? The charm of the original Matrix movie was that it held up to all levels of scrutiny. If you wanted to go see people getting kicked and shooting other people, it was that. If you wanted to go and think about the nature of reality and whether ignorance is really bliss, it was that too. This second movie felt like if you wanted just fun action, you'd have to rent it on DVD and use the scene jump feature to go to the cool fight scenes (like the one in the temple with all the weapons...). \\"Revolutions\\" is almost the opposite--if you actually think about the plot, it makes no sense. For instance, (PLOT SPOILER COMING UP NEXT) the battle against Smith is won because the machine that is hooking Neo up to the matrix sends an electric shock into his body, causing all six billion or whatever Agent Smiths to explode and turn back into their original selves. Then the rain stops, and the little girl makes the sun rise. And Neo is carried off by a giant machine, maybe dead, maybe not. If anyone can explain that to me, I'd love to hear them.

0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown must be doing something right for this novel to be a best-seller.  Everyone I know is raving about it.  So I read it.  But, having read Holy Blood, Holy Grail 20 years ago, the DaVinci Code is like a small appetizer after a large, gourmet meal.  Dan Brown is credited with extensive research, but it seems to me that he merely skimmed HB,HG. Character names reflect this.  The British Royal Historian, Sir Leigh Teabing? The three authors of HB,HG are historians Lincoln, Leigh and Baigent, an anagram of Teabing. The murder victim Jaques Sauniere? The real-life priest who discovers the &quot;secret&quot; in HB,HG is Berenger Sauniere.  Bezu is the name of a Templars' castle.  But that's enough.<br />The characters seem to be linguistically challenged in figuring out the word puzzles.  I can't imagine a French woman not knowing that her name, Sophie, means wisdom. The foreigners just seemed to be Americans with funny accents.<br />As for the pay-off, is a 2,000-year-old &quot;secret&quot; really a motive for murder?<br />That said, perhaps the subject of this novel will open up a few more minds.

We know that he dangled his youngest child over a balcony in Germany, he has totally altered his face since the earlier days,and yes, his skin is currently white, but wait! Stop there for just a second.<br />Go back to the year 1988. Michael Jackson is still capitalizing on the success of his first two major-label albums and has just released his third album, Bad. He is wondering what's next for him. He decides to write a tell-all autobiography, explaining his past, present, and future in music and the entertainment business. He also explains his love life, his ability to come up with extraordiary music, short films, and even dance moves, and also tries to clear up some of the nasty rumors that have since plagued his career.<br />Ladies and gentlemen, this is the single greatest autobiography I have ever read in my life! Not only does Michael express his feelings about music, children, and personal life, but he also displays true detail and emotion within every single sentence. If you are a die-hard Michael Jackson fan, you will really want this book!<br />No matter what anybody will ever say about him, Michael Jackson is, has been, and always will be the greatest musical artist in the history of this world!
B00005JMFR|4.0|As with all sequels to blockbuster movies, people allow themselves to get caught up in the hype, and go into the film with unrealistically high expectations. To all those who have given this movie a one star rating, I feel sorry for you.<br />I saw Revolutions on Sunday afternoon, after months of eager anticipation. I tried to go into it with as little expectations as possible, and knowing as little as possible. It paid off. I was thrilled by the conclusions that the movie delivered. It wrapped it up cleanly, while doing the typical Hollywood thing, and leaving open the possibility of another movie.<br />Quite possibly the only movie that will top this experience will be The Return of the King.<br />Anyhoo, as most will know, Revolutions picks up at the precise point where Reloaded finished. Neo is trapped in a sort of limbo between the real world and the Matrix, unable to escape. From there, we are taken on a roller coaster ride (admittedly less mind-blowing than Revolutions' two predecessors) through to the finale of the human's battle against the invading sentinels, and Neo's final confrontation with the numerous Agent Smiths.<br />Through it all, the film does a great job of proving that despite the revelation that Neo is really just another part of the program that is the Matrix, he is still human and capable of experiencing all the strengths and frailties that makes us human.<br />And, in the end, it is that which will save Zion from extermination, rather than simply being able to piece together the riddles that the Oracle gives.<br />Revolutions is the perfect finish to the Matrix trilogy. It is not absolutely conclusive. If anyone went into the movie expecting that, then they were idiots. It does leave the door ajar for future projects. But in the grand scheme of things, I believe the Wachowski brothers could not have done a better job of wrapping things up.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I'm more than a little tired of reading or hearing about how this movie did poorly.  It had a very successful first weekend, it totalled over 220 million worldwide, it made a profit.  It wasn't reasonable to expect it to make 800 million as Spider-Man did, it's too dark, too violent and too smart.<BR>First, let's all get on one page here:  The Hulk is NOT a superhero, he is a monster.  He has boundless courage and will literally move mountains for the people he loves, but he doesn't care much about &quot;puny humans&quot; as a rule.<BR>The supposedly slow beginning in fact very crisply and quckly introduces and explores the four major characters and advances the plot toward the Hulk's first appearance.  (Does anyone remember that the first Superman film also went nearly an hour before he appeared in costume?)  After that it roars and smashes its way to the end (and the Hulk has plenty of screen time).  The Hulk does not look &quot;like a p'oed Shrek&quot;.  The ending is not obscure, the viewers are dumb.  The point is that the Hulk, fueled by virtually limitless rage, has virtually limitless strength.  When he shouted &quot;Take it all!&quot;, he was so furious that he absorbed and converted energy at a greater rate than his father could absorb, so Daddy blew up real good.  Thank you to all, by the way, for finally explaining how the extra mass comes  and goes.  It's moisture absorbed out of the air, converted to nutrients as needed by the &quot;nanomeds&quot;, which runs off his body by the gallon (a couple of hundred gallons, in fact) when he changes back to human.<BR>So well done Mr. Lee and all, and all my pity to the parents of the people who don't &quot;get&quot; this film.  Sorry, folks, you have dumb kids.
B000063147|4.0|I had never even heard of Avenged Sevenfold until I bought and played Madden 2003 for the PS2.  After hearing their song \\"Chapter Four\\" (from their second album, Waking the Fallen) I was hooked and decided to check them out.  I'm glad I did.  Lead singer M Shadows perfectly blends his screaming style of singing with a slower, more passionate voice to create some truly great songs.  Being a fan of the power ballad, I would have to say that my favorite song on the album is Warmness on the Soul.  Both of Avenged Sevenfold's albums are a great buy and I look forward to more from this up and coming superstar band.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Just a comment to the idiots out there rating this album below four stars. You're out of your league on this one. Go back to your Limp Bizkit, Nelly, and 50 Cents. I really like the comment that one reviewer wrote, &quot;students (in his/her college) with REAL taste listened to artists like Janet Jackson and Madonna who are much better.  <br />I understand that Dylan isn't for everyone but get a clue. Why do you think that this album (as well as Blonde on Blonde and Highway 61 Revisited) continually show up on top 100 album list all over the net? These albums are classics that will be listened too 100 years from now. Dylan is a rare talent. A once in a life time musical genius. Just count how many covers have been performed on his songs. How will they rank your favorite artist a 100 years from now. A blip on the radar screen.<br />I guess I could be an idiot and go review a Madonna album but that would mean that I would have to listen to one first. Yuck!<br />Just to save you more money you probably shouldn't buy these CD's:<br />Joni Michell - Blue<BR>Joni Michell - Court and Spark<BR>Phebe Snow - Second Childhood<BR>Richard and Linda Thompson - Shoot Out the Lights<BR>Neil Young - Moving Pictures<BR>Neil Young - Rust Never Sleeps<BR>Neil Young - Comes a Time<br />Now excuse me while I go listen to Blood on the Tracks for the 437737 time.

B000006YMN|3.0|After the lackluster Eyes Of A Woman album, I Stand Alone was a much better album and more homogenous, and Agnetha's new looks were stunning! Agnetha recorded this with Chicago's Peter Cetera, and this could have been huge - really huge - had Agnetha not been so reluctant to promote it. It was heralded by a bomb of a single, The Last Time, that should have been a hit, and there were several other songs with great hooks: Let It Shine for one, but also Little White Secrets and the title track I Stand Alone. The sound is warm, the production slick and laid-back but perhaps also a bit bland, although Agnetha tried to add some edge with the rocky We Got A Way. It's nowhere as awful as Save Me (from the Eyes Of A Woman LP) but it's one of those 80s rock tracks that haven't aged very well. The other tracks are mostly ballads, including a duet with Peter Cetera, I Wasn't The One Who Said Goodbye (also recorded in Spanish as Yo No Fui Quien Dijo Adis), that are pleasant enough but not particularly interesting. I don't think the album is as strong today as I thought back then but it is enjoyable, and I award I Stand Alone 3 stars in total for some nice 80s nostalgia.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|The album is for the most part a \\"Shaking the Tree\\" upgrade -- a bunch of songs from the 80s, only now with 90s/00s material added. But it falls short precisely where \\"Shaking the Tree\\" does: only 1 song (\\"Solsbury Hill\\") from the 1st 2 albums. <br />In addition, Gabriel includes 5 songs from his latest album, which begs the question: Why? \\"Up\\" was no doubt strong, but it does not merit 30 minutes of disc space at the expense of his early work.   <br />\\"Hit\\" is not a representative sampler of Gabriel's output.
B000006YMM|2.0|Agnetha has said that she's no longer very pleased with her post-ABBA solo albums, and upon listening to this 1985 offering, you can understand why she has later said that &quot;some of the songs don't feel nearly as convincing now as they did back then&quot;. Back in '85 I had high hopes for this album when I first heard the flagship single I Won't Let You Go. Co-penned by Agnetha, this was a strong pop tune with great hooks, but I recall being immensely disappointed by the album. Even though some of the songs are in fact not that bad, the album generally suffers from a very sterile sound and an overblown 80s production that hasn't aged very gracefully. As another reviewer has also noted, it is a major problem that most of the songs are cut in a low key that doesn't suit Agnetha's voice very well - she's best in her high registre - that's where her voice really got to shine on ABBA's recordings. She probably comes closest in the ballads The Angels Cry and the song penned by producer Eric Stewart (of 10CC), I Won't Be Leaving You. Even the up-tempo second single One Way Love (penned by Jeff Lynne of ELO) fails to sound entirely convincing. One of the better cuts, Just One Heart, received a limited release on single in Holland and recalls the calypso feeling of The Heat Is On from her previous album, just as the rocky I Keep Turning Off Lights is reminiscent of the far superior Can't Shake Loose. Side 1 holds together pretty well until the annoying last song Click Track (she did a superb video for that one, though), but side 2 is quite weak. We Should Be Together is a good track, but the song (Why Don't Ya) Save Me is dreadful 80s rock at its cringiest. Two more songs were recorded for the album but only released as B-sides: You're There is a lovely pleasant mid-tempo cut, also co-penned by Agnetha, and it's a shame this wasn't included on the album. The other one, Turn The World Around, has some intriguing verses that are not only let down by the tinny production but also by a weak and  repetitive chorus. Both tracks made their CD debut on the Agnetha &amp; Frida - The Voice Of ABBA CD but can also be found on Agnetha's Greatest Hits package That's Me. Eyes Of A Woman is not entirely worthless, but knowing what Agnetha is capable of singing, this album simply does not do her justice, and the production drags down, leading me to only award this two stars.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|I still jump when I watch this film. I've seen it over 100 times and it's just as great now as it was 20 years ago!! BUY IT!!
B000003TAW|5.0|I started off my Weezer collection a few years back with the Green Album. Many hardcore fans would probably ridicule me for deciding that this CD was catchy and had good melody. However, I now believe that this CD, the Blue Album, is not only the best Weezer CD available, but more importantly, perhaps the most important CD of the 1990's.<br />Rivers Cuomo has a talent many music-writers can only dream of. He has, in my eyes, created 4 (5 if you count The Lion and The Witch, their live CD) albums that are flawless. Every track on this CD, especially, has its own.. soul.. if you will. It is not lyrically bound to any stereotypes of the other songs. Every track, such as the catchy Buddy Holly, to the awe-inspiring In the Garage, sounds awesome. Pick this one up if you don't have it.<br />=w=
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|My infamous review of &quot;Is This It&quot; was probably not the apex of sound musical critique, and I am certainly not overly proud of it.  Yet my feelings towards it and towards this sophomore effort are still those of unimpressed cynicism--I do not understand how a mediocre power-pop band that writes uncatchy songs consistently in the same key and with the same simple chord progressions can be elevated to the plateau of &quot;rock saviours.&quot;  Each of these 11 tunes mines the same ground of VU-Television-Cars regurgitation--and such overlying simplicity ought not to be excused with comparisons to the Ramones, since The Strokes are doing nothing as revolutionary as their punk predecessors.  Fabrizio Moretti still sounds like he can't find a fill to save his life, Hammond and Valensi's guitars spit out the same stuttering riffs again and again, and Julian tries to make everyone forget the fact that he can't sing by recycling that grating noise-distortion vocal effect again and again (surely The Strokes have something more up their sleeve that this).  The riff of &quot;12:51&quot; owes an unpayable debt to The Cars, and the song's mumbly vocals (more distortion) provide no distinction whatsoever.  But, according to such magazines as Spin and Rolling Stone, it only matters how 'cool' a band is anymore--forget their actual songwriting or performance talents.  While this diluted garage rock, falling somewhere between VU-Lite and Stooges-Lite, may have been appealing to some two years ago, I can't see how anyone could throw such praise upon The Strokes now that the far superior Interpol and White Stripes have taken center stage.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Clearly separated by the violent yet punishing beauty of \\"Mer De Noms\\"; \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a welcome, yet bipolar avenue of music with crushing ease and an ambient thrust. The spectrum of melody and experimentation is broadened in this effort, and each song holds its own quiet force of deafening emotion.<br />This release flows from the heavy ballads of a journey through rapids in \\"Mer De Noms\\" into a waterfall of free falls, calming beauty and focussed song writing that is evident in \\"Thirteenth Step\\". An obvious contradictory approach to music from that of front-man Maynard James Keenan of Tool fame, those who are looking for another Tool album will not be satisfied. This album requires an open mind and an apt for beauty, as each song releases an opposite emotion to the last. <br />Billy Howerdel really is the driving force of this masterpiece, his almost foreign guitar rhythms and melodies create a very addictive aura within the record- you never know what he is going to throw at you next, which really emphasises the incredible song writing of this record. As usual Keenan's lyrics are at a remarkable level, and fit perfectly with the mood of each song, tackling such topics as addiction, war and Christianity. Due to the departure Violinist/Bassist, Paz, the soothing violins that contradicted heaviness in the first release aren't evident. There is a more mellow strings movement in this release, supported with strong baselines from addition Jeordie \\"Twiggy Ramirez\\" White of Marilyn Manson Fame.<br />Overall this record is a breath air in a rock spectrum crowded by nu-metal five-minute-wonders. A rock album that shows that there are intelligent songwriters! Clearly not a Mer de noms II, \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a work of art in its own right. A Perfect Circle will show the world real music with this release; that will go down in history as one of the best rock albums of all time.<BR>5/5
038572179X|3.0|I just finished Atonement with my book club.  Out of seven of us, I was the only one who was happy I read it.<br />McEwan's writing is so sensual and detailed that you can truly picture his scenes in your mind's eye.  It is truly poetic and beautiful description.  For me, this made the book worth reading.<br />On the other hand, the book is divided into three segments and the first segment is excrutiatingly slow.  If you can manage to slog through this first section, you will be rewarded by the remaining two thirds of the book which are much faster paced and culminate in a &quot;twist&quot;.  I should warn you that the twist is subtle and requires careful reading of the final chapter.  It was the type of twist that left me thinking, not the type that I sat up and said &quot;oh my goodness, how clever!&quot;.<br />In terms of the subject matter, you will follow the life of a young girl who accuses a member of her household of a terrible crime and in fact ruins his life.  The book follows the accuser and the accused through time and through a war.  I didn't feel particularly close to any of the characters by the end of the book so on some level the ending really didn't move me.<br />I did give it three stars though simply for the fabulous use of the language.  I am anxious to try another book by the author to see if the plots are more engaging, because the writing is so rhythmic and lush.  <br />This may be a great book to listen to on tape.  I found that reading it aloud was actually more enjoyable than reading it silently.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album sheds a light amongst its overcrowded genre. Unlike \\"Hybrid Theory\\" the album is not written around the guitar, its drive is through the innovative sampling and vocal melodies. A perfect balance in its diverse musical realm, \\"Meteora\\" is full of integrity and does not fall directly into any category of music. Maturity of the band shows their intelligence in song writing and this album is truly a meteoric experience. <br />Chester Benningham's vocals are top notch and balanced perfectly with the more focussed rapping of Mike Shinoda. The use of Joseph Hans sampling and DJ skills allows an adrenaline and a propos musical direction. Every song carries a veracity of its own though unfortunately dulled by the shortness of the album. Just as you get into the album it finishes, allowing for the album to become repetitive rather quickly. <br />\\"Meteora\\" will inevitably be a hit in the music scene, drawing a varied crowd of listeners- this is in favour of the band, as the song writing is a lot more focussed than Linkin Park's album of establishment, \\"Hybrid Theory\\". In order for the band to carry on the brilliance of this album, an even more focussed album needs to follow, or the band will loose their grasp high up in the rock/hip hop assembly. Overall the album sets a higher standard amongst the band than their first release, yet shows that commercialism doesn't just come with power chords, DJ's and manufactured ballads.<BR>(4/5)
B00002SWEM|3.0|I absolutely loved the Buena Vista Social Club album, but this DVD was not all that I had hoped for. It had a nice slow pace, but it became a bit boring at times. I don't feel like I really got to know the artists, although there are some nice moments (when they are exploring New York comes to mind), it is mostly abbreviated footage from concerts and recording sessions along with some brief interviews with the performers. It shows some very flavorful images of Cuba, but I couldn't help thinking about how much money Ry Cooder must have made off of these amazingly talented musicians! He seems very aloof in the parts that show him. My biggest disappointment: I was hoping for uncut footage of the concerts, but we only get two or three uncut songs. The &quot;El Cuarto de Tula&quot; concert at Carnegie hall that plays during the credits is fantastic, but this DVD needs either more documentary or more music! It is somewhere in between. Also, my favorite song &quot;De Camino a la Vereda&quot; is nowhere to be found in this DVD.
076790592X|3.0|I chose to read this book for a book report because I had heard such wonderful things about it. <BR>Tuesdays With Morrie is an insightful true story about the friendship of a man and his old college professor, Morrie, who is slowly dying of ALS (Lou Gherig's disease).<BR>I would recommend this book for certain people only.  While Morrie's views may be helpful to some, I truly believe that this book is overrated.  I had heard that this book was life changing, and for me this was certainly not the case.  For extremely materialistic people, this book may change some values, but for an average person, the book won't tell anything they don't already know.  I was disappointed that it did not live up to the expectations I had in my mind.    <br />In my opinion, Tuesdays With Morrie was a good story that was not as well written as it should have been. While Morrie does have good messages to share with readers, these are things that most people are usually conscious of.  The writing itself did not do justice to the meaningful story that could have been portrayed.  <br />However, I did enjoy the story to some extent, and because it is a short book, it is worth reading.  I think that some people may need this book as a small reminder of what is really important in life.  I also appreciate the fact that Mitch Albom shared Morrie's inspirational views with the world, and I do agree that the idea behind this book is important and meaningful.<br />Just the same, I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.  Overall, Tuesdays With Morrie was a hardly above average book that I, unfortunately, found very hard to enjoy thoroughly.

078401213X|4.0|\\"Pi\\" is a breath of fresh air for those who enjoy original and dark movies. Written and directed by the experimental and promising Darren Aronofsky, \\"Pi\\" presents an interesting and intelligent story.<br />Max Cohen (actor Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius, obsessed with his theory that says that all the elements that conform life are based on numbers. Max thinks that there are mathematical patterns in everything around us, and that a particular number is the key of all existence, so Max will do everything to decode that hidden number. Soon he will learn that he isn't the only one looking for that number.<br />Sean Gullette delivered a great performance as the neurotic Max, and carried on his shoulders a big percentage of the interest of the movie. The director Darren Aronofsky took care of even the slightest detail of the film, the story, the music, the situations and the mathematical theories are very interesting overall.<br />\\"Pi\\" is recommendable for everyone who enjoy good independent movies.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!? Sorry but I read some discouraging reviews and I just wanted to ki-... Ok Mulan is a GREAT movie!!! Funny, Cool... All that. I think it was made very well. Now I don't know the original story or whatever but this was great! It could be for girls or boys. It doesn't have all that lovey dovey stuff. If your like... I don't know how old, but this is a very good movie! It's about a girl who was told by the matchmaker that she would never bring her family honor. So she dresses up as a boy to fight in the army in her father's place. Her father uses a cane so he wouldn't do so good in the army. You know fighting... Anyway there's Mushu(Voice of Eddie Murphy), Cri-kee,(her lucky cricket), her horse Kahn, Li Shang(Her captain), the bad guy Shan-Yu and her friends Chien-Po, Ling and this short guy but I forgot his name... Something with a 'Y'... But anyway Disney did good with this. Good for the whole family. You may want to hear stuff people say these days and stuff. Or stuff Eddie Murphy would say normally or whatever but I think you don't need that because It's still a cool show! So go out and BUY IT because it's cool, fun and just FANTABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> P.S(It WAS made in 1998 after all, then was... kind of different from now, right?) :-)  &gt;^,,^&lt;  (Trust me. All of this is the honest truth!!! I mean why would I lie?) ;-]

B00005JMFR|5.0|Story: A Acting: B Direction: A Visuals: A+ Overall Grade: A <br />Okay, first of all, I loved the first Matrix. I couldn't wait for the next 2. BUT I did not see Reloaded in the theater because the critics and my friends told me it was terrible. I listened to them and ignored it all the way until last week when I reluctantly rented the DVD. Much to my bittersweet chagrin, I liked it. A lot. The action + special effects were awesome (in the true sense of the word), the story was fluid and the themes dealt with were relevant and intelligently handled (the major theme being free will vs. predestination and how love works out out within that apparently paradoxical framework). Excellently executed in a taut, thrilling, butt-kicking, name-taking rollercoaster ride of a movie. Good stuff.<br />First lesson learned: Movies are subjective. Everyone has different tastes. Your taste is not mine. I will never listen with absolute attention to a critic or my friends again. Of course, I will weigh their opinions and tack them on to my \\"discretionary buffer zone\\" before deciding to see a movie - but I will never make an absolute decision based on others opinions in matters of subjectivity again. Second lesson learned: Expectations suck. (Which is probably why the critics and my friends were let down with Reloaded)<br />Now, onto dealing with Revolutions...from my perspective:<br />After my unexpectedly pleasant encounter with Reloaded, I eagerly anticipated seeing Revolutions. This time around, critically speaking, the critics reviews were tougher and my friends expectations were once again shattered. They either *liked* it, mildly disliked it or hated it. All were disappointed by it. Hmmm...what was I to think? I learned my lesson after seeing Reloaded...this time around I was going to ignore them and go into it with no expectations. I decided to let the story take me where it was going instead of me having a preconceived idea as to where I 'expected' it to go. I just saw it. ILOVED it. <br />First lesson reinforced: Critics suck. I can't fully trust my friends' judgments ever again. Second lesson reinforced: Drop expectations (of a subjective nature of course...moral expectations are a different ball game). Sometimes when it comes to judging film, instead of letting the storytellers take us on a journey, we become the backseat drivers. We kick and scream, begging the driver to change his/her course because it's not where we wanted to go. I surmise that this could be the reason that most folks disliked Revolutions. They jumped into the car wanting to go somewhere else.<br />Now Revolutions was definitely a change of atmosphere and pacing in comparison to the previous two. In this movie, most of the story took place in either ZION or a spacecraft. The feel of this movie reminded me of ALIENS (Alien 2)...dark and at times creepily suspenseful. And unlike the first Matrix and Reloaded, the filling isn't comprised of mind-blowing special effect laced - reality-defying kung-fu action sequences. Instead, the action, however quantified, is INTENSE in a different way. Replacing the usually ever-present hand-to-hand combat is a craaazy techno-war between the humans and machines with an insane amount of bullets being fired. FUN. Furthermore, for the first time in this trilogy, I felt a genuine sense of fear. I actually feared for the lives of the characters faced with imminent death. The Wachowski's did a tremendous job portraying courage in times of absolute terror...which is a large part of the movie. And the ending...wow...now this is RIDICULOUSLY COOL. Neo and Agent Smith duke it out for the last time. I must say that this is the BEST fight scene depicted in the trilogy (again...in my opinion). I left the theater very satisfied.<br />For many, the depth of philosophical exploration in the Matrix series was not adequate enough. I disagree. Although I concede that I did leave the theater with some questions still unanswered (ontological in nature), the simple truths brought out by this series WERE more than enough for me. Revolutions was a terrific compliment to the previous two, ending the series brilliantly - tying together the loose strings Morpheus, Trinity and the people of Zion were anticipating. Simplicity is often very profound. Faith. Hope. Courage. Love. Hate. Life. Death. Choice. Fate. These are the concepts the Matrix tautly grappled with - and with boldness like no other film I have ever seen. Simple concepts...yet each with significant relation to our core existence. <br />Now, the movie did end kind of open-ended. We weren't really given complete answers to everything. Well...I hypothesize that the Wachowski bros. left our questions insufficiently answered for a purpose. Not that they want us to believe there is another movie coming that will seek to offer further explanation, but they want us to choose what we believe. Maybe they want us to take the journey Neo and the others took instead of telling us plainly. If all the questions were answered, we wouldn't have to think. Now that would be a shame. Hmmmm...could it be? It's possible. :)<br />5/5 (Booyah!)
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Don't get this backwards, I really did love this movie (the screenplay, the acting, the filming).  It's just I felt a little, um, uncomfortable, each time a scene ratcheted back, and we find the main character in the equivalent position of somebody that's had the ol' shaving cream-and-feather prank done to them while they're sleeping.  He is constantly \\"reawakening\\" due to his medical condition, and usually it is with figurative egg/pie/shaving cream on his face...he is constantly momentarily confused until he figures out what has just gone on.  <br />He is on a Dirty Harry type of avengement for his wife's rape and murder, but his clothes don't fit right, his car looks like he forgot to buff the wax off, and he's constantly looking for his Life under the couch cushions.   Everybody calls him Lenny, which he hates.  He gets tricked into doing everything from paying for two hotel rooms to carrying out somebody else's vendetta.  Still, you root for the guy, which may make this one huge practical joke on the viewer...you end up feeling at the end of the movie like somebody slipped something in your drink.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Ok, now I have read all of these reviews and have read all of the reviews on enigmamusic (dot) com and I DISAGREE with all of the negative comments.  Grant you, this album is different but hey, who wants to buy the same ole, same ole?  I listened tho this SEVERAL times before I posted a review and I must say IT GETS BETTER AS I HEAR IT MORE OFTEN!  It is a TERRIBLE shame that this album has not been promoted more.  If you are interested in listening to a music cd that will captivate your mind and soul - I recommend this one!  For all you out there who say you are true enigma fans - let me be the first one to say that the key is an OPEN MIND.  If you don't have that - you won't enjoy the enigma experience.  I recomend this CD over and over!
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I have been a Sarah McLachlan fan for a long time.  When I saw this CD was out, I could not wait to purchase it.  When I listened to it the first time, I was so disappointed.  All the songs sound the same; there is nothing distinctive about this CD.  I thought perhaps I would warm up to it after listening to it a few more times, but still, nothing.  Don't waste your money on this new CD, her previous CDs were so much better.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought Fallen after seeing Evanescence in concert in February at the famous Metro in Chicago.  This was weeks before the C.D. even dropped.  The tickets cost a mere $8.  That was the best money I've ever spent. The concert was amazing and I knew within the first notes of the first song that I would be buying Fallen as soon as it hit the shelves, also money well spent.<br />     Maybe it's the tortured soul within me but this sound and these lyrics were something I could relate to.  They were what I have wanted to belt out many times had I had the ability.  And Amy has a certain distinct quality to her that I found very inspiring.  There is so much emotion behind every word she sings.  It's truly amazing.
0345409671|5.0|One of my all time favorite Rice novels. Brilliant and captivating as always.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I have enjoyed the previous movies by this writer / director, that the latest \\"Love Actually\\" was brilliant. I cant wait to get it on DVD and watch it again with my wife.<br />5 stars !
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This album is different from all her previous other albums, but Sarah is in a different part of her life now and that's what makes her work great is change. Many complain that this album is too soft? or doesn't have stand-out tracks, weak lyrics or only has 10 tracks. All these comments sound the same just like when &quot;Surfacing&quot; first arrived and was reviewed. I think only time and repeated listening is what type of artist Sarah is. This album is great on its own merit and think people should listen to it more than once before making harsh remarks. I love Sarah's voice no matter what time of song she does. Let's be happy that she does what she does and we are able to experience her wonderful voice again. I predict World on Fire will be the 2nd single as it's very strong and meaningful.
6303122876|5.0|\\"Another world, another time, in the age of wonder.  A thousand years ago, this land was green and good, until the Crystal cracked.  A single piece was lost, a shard of the Crystal.  Then strife began.  Then two new races appeared:  the cruel Skeksis and the gentle Mystics.\\"<br />The ones in power in the Castle of the Crystal are the tall, lumbering Skeksis, a cross between vultures and dinosaurs, putrid lizards, as Aughra calls them.  Some are downright fierce, such as the Garthim Master and Ritual Master, others are comical, such as the Chamberlain who challenges the Garthim Master for the emperor's throne...and loses.  They also must have won the Worst Table Manners by a non-human intelligent species Award, as they burp and make loud smacking noises when eating their roast Nebri.  In contrast, the four armed, tan, silver maned Mystics are more laid back, content in their simple peaceful ways, and despite being pokey upon their travel to the Castle of Crystal, don't underestimate them--they are powerful.<br />Jen, a Gelfling raised by the Mystics when the Skeksis massacred his people, is the Chosen One.  His journey--I know, Joseph Campbell--is to find the shard and heal the Crystal, and the land, or else the land will become a place of evil for good.  As the prophecy goes, \\"When single shine the triple suns, what was sundered and undone, shall be whole, the two made one, by Gelfling hand or else by none.\\"  So when the Skeksis discover his existence, they press the panic button, so to speak, and sic the Garthim, lumbering black-carapaced crosses between woodlice, sowbugs, and beetles with crustacean claws who make clicking sounds when aroused, after our hero.<br />In his quest, Jen is helped by Aughra, a squat gray curmudgeon of a harridan with her one removable eye, who lives in an observatory, and Kira, a pretty blonde Gelfling who knows how to communicate with animals via their calls, so it shows not all blondes are dumb, as she proves more resourceful than him, including a significance anatomical difference that saves both their hides later in the movie.  Her pet Fizzgig is the most comical creature, resembling a furry light brown ball that barks, and reveals a mouthful of teeth when it roars.  Jen and Kira complement each other, he has spent his life under the learned Mystics, while she has spent her life at one with nature.<br />Jim Henson clearly borrowed some Buddhist principles here.  The low-register chant of the Mystics owes a nod to the multiphonic chants practiced by the Tibetan Buddhist monks, as is the sandpainting one of the Mystics does in the early part of the movie.  Then there's Aughra's mindset on what happens if Jen fails in his quest:  \\"The end of the world, or the beginning.  All the same, big change.  Sometimes good, sometimes bad,\\" which is kind of a Hindu mindset recalling the Shiva/Vishnu relationship, of destruction and renewal.<br />Another symbolic representation is the image of Aughra's house the Mystic leader shows Jen.  It resembles a brain, which given the orrery in her abode denotes her as the one gifted with scientific knowledge.<br />Apart from the jungle scenery, it's the creatures that's a real visual triumph, from exotic plants and animals.  The only letdown are the potato-like quiff-haired Pod People, who look like some toys for the 5 and unders.  But of individual creatures, Fizzgig, Kira's pet, steals the show, as does the calculating Chamberlain, with his funny cunning whimper and sickly smile.<br />Aided by Trevor Jones' sweeping score, The Dark Crystal will be optimal for kids 8 to 11, as those younger may find the Skeksis frightening and even disgusting, but for those into fantasy, people of any age, depending on how well you can take the Podlings., including a significance anatomical difference that saves both their hides later in the movie.

0812550706|4.0|Orson Scott Card thrills readers in his first installment of the Ender series.  It tells the story of Ender's rise to power at Battle School leading up to the ultimate showdown between the humans and the buggers.  I thought it was a very interesting book with a plot and storyline that keeps your interest. I advise any lover of science fiction and fantasy is sure to love Ender's Game, as well as the entire Ender series.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This movie is quite possibly one of the best movies I have seen since Bridget Jones's Diary. I loved it and so did my fiance. Not only is it extremely well written, it is also extremely well acted. There is not another feel-good movie out there this holiday season!
B000002534|5.0|The first concert I ever saw was Santana here in Baltimore in 1970. A friend insisted that I go and Carlos and I have been connected at the umbilical and in the spirit ever since.<br />Borboletta is just one of many examples of Carlos' magic and soul. The musicians that lend themselves to this awakening are mostly masters themselves. The ebb and flow of the sounds on this CD will transport you and make you get down and everything in between. Words fail for the most part so let me end by leaving y'all a quote that I came across some time ago.<br />&quot;For heights and depths no words can reach, music is the soul's own speech.&quot;<br />This is the best tribute I can think of right now for Santana and just one of many great works of his - Borboletta
B00005OM4N|5.0|I had to listen to this album a second time because i could not believe I was listening to Britney Spears. &quot;Britney&quot; is chalked full of up-beat catchy songs that far surpass those on &quot;Baby One More Time...&quot; and &quot;Oops....&quot; &quot;Anticipation&quot; &quot;Cinderella&quot; &quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot; &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; &quot;Overprotected&quot; &quot;Bombastic Love,&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; acutally made me want to dance (very unlike me). &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot; is a very cute ballad for what it is.<br />I was surprized to find that Spears (like Aguileria and Simpson) co-wrote a great deal of her album. In fact, her songs, including &quot;Anticipation&quot; &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot; are some of the better tracks. The only &quot;goof&quot; on the album is the iky &quot;Not A Girl,&quot; which sticks out like a sour-thumb (not co-written by Spears).<br />&quot;Britney&quot; is the best pop album I have heard in some time. Striking in its stuberness not to be classified in the same class of music that Spears herself helped to bring back to the forefront of Popular music. It is up-beat like her previous tries, but totally different in the &quot;air&quot; of the album. Certainly worth a second (and third) listen.
B00005JKC3|5.0|Don't take any word from anybody about this movie, you have to watch this movie to actually know if you like it or not.<BR>I personally love it, I have watched this movie numerous times, and still enjoy every bit of it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|All that can be said it that Christina really does &quot;Strip&quot; for the audience, emotionally speaking. The results are fantastic songs such as &quot;Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Walk Away,&quot; and &quot;Soar.&quot; Some of the more fun songs such as &quot;Dirrty,&quot; &quot;Infatuation,&quot; and &quot;Fighter&quot; make the album all the more apealing.<br />I was surprized to find that Aguilera has a huge hand in writing the album, and even more surprized with fabulous results. I look forward to her work in the future, and I hope that this trend of &quot;soul bearing&quot; will continue.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought &quot;Let's go&quot; for my then-6-year-old because even though I thought Sk8r boi (or whatever) was completely vapid, both my kids knew all of the words.  Avril is not punk.  Avril is not deep.  Avril does not have an enormous vocal range.  Avril lacks stage presence (yes, we went to the concert--my partner, me, and three kids under eight; give us a medal).  What Avril has is an ability to sing songs that kids get, that they can sing along to, and that will, over time, help them to understand that life sometimes sucks and sometimes doesn't. If she sounds like Pink and Alanis, so much the better.  We have their albums too.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I saw this in theatre I was totally blown away with what I was seeing. Eye-candy is the only word I can think to describe this wonderful film. Kidman and McGregor light up the screen with wonderful vocals. <br />The DVD itself is a force to be dealt with. Music videos, entended and deleted scenes, and tons of extras are packed into the extra disc making this a must have DVD for serious movie lovers.
B00005JMFR|5.0|The Matrix 3 is a groundbreaking film. You must let the directors take you on the ride instead of holding your own thoughts on what should happen. The films message is one that proves effective with any given points in life. The idea of Love.Neo fights for love in the movie and so do the people of zion. This film is not easy to forget. The cast could not have been better. The love story is honest. While the ideas are highly original. Its best when viewed more than once.
B000089RVR|5.0|&quot;No Angel&quot; was a wonderful album of mellowed out sad love-songs, but &quot;Life For Rent&quot; ventures into deeper territory. Dido's beautiful voice compliments the tri-beats and beautiful melodies that infect the album with an unshakeable dreary lovelyness.<br />Gorgeous songs such as &quot;White Flag,&quot; &quot;Sand in My Shoes,&quot; and the unstoppable &quot;Life For Rent&quot; make the album a must have for any serious music lover.
0440237688|1.0|Ok, here is a story about a town who doesn't have to worry about pain or change.  You are assigned jobs and you have to apply for spouses and children but there are only 2 children, one boy and one girl, per household.  And they have The Ceremonies, where at certain ages you get certain privliges.  Anyways when this one kid named Jonas turns 12 he is \\"selected\\" as the Reciever of Memory and he meets the Giver where he gets all these memories.  He expiriences stuff the rest of the town has no clue about.<BR>Anyways I had to read this book for school and I didn't like it too much.  It wasn't hard to understand - everything was explained clearly.  But I mean come on, this book is so strange in a bad way.  And when Jonas learned what being released was it made me want to put the book down and never touch it again.  I can handle a lot of things but this book makes me sick!  And I would not read this to younger children or those with a weak stomach.  So to anyone who is thinking of buying this book, don't unless you have to for work/school.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Wow, is of course the only word that can descibe the ethereal euphoria that McLachlan creates in her beautiful ablum. The six year break that she took after Surfacing was certainly an emotional roller coaster for her, with the death of her mother and the time with her child, but it yielded wonderful results.<br />Again the music is haunting and mystical, but it takes an even deeper detour that was skipped in previous works. Love is portrayed in a &quot;dark place&quot; and life is cast in a blue, hazy light.<br />McLachlan gives us a look into a dimension of conscience that few writers are able to bless us with. She is proof that it doesn't take &quot;an album a year&quot; to stay beloved by the public, and truely she only gets better with time.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Jennifer Connelly is a great actress and she was great in this. That said: Everything else about the movie sucked.<BR>Went on too long also. I was sitting in the theater waiting for it to end and it just kept going!!!
B00008J4P5|5.0|This cd is anything but boring. It is one of the best cds i have ever bought.  Each song stands out and is just amazing in its own right. However, i will not be naive, this cd does has a fall back. The last song, I admit, is not very good, its more like a conversation than a song, and i dont really listen to it much. <BR>Songs on the album that everyone should hear, are Black Math, Hypotize, Little Acorns and the greatest white stripe song ever recorded, The Hardest Button to Button.<BR>Great CD, buy it.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This cd is a masterpiece, Pink Floyd really knows how to make good music. The best tracks are &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Money&quot;. Pick it up if you want a great cd, there is not a flaw on this album. Also, check out some Frank Zappa for good music.
B000068OSK|5.0|This is the greatest cd the white stripes have ever made. It captures music in such a raw sense, its like you are listening to it live. Ther songs are simple, but thats what makes it work. Their is nothing more to say than its amazing and their best cd.
B0000009SI|5.0|Zappa is the GREATEST!!! Apostrophe is musical genius. It is just one out of many Zappa masterpieces. BUY IT!!!
0060194995|4.0|Wow! This book was great. I am not much of a reader and I have a really hard time concentrating on reading something when I am not interested in it. This book was very interesting and caught my attention the first time I picked it up. The character that interested me the most was the little girl Scout who was also telling the story. Scout was a normal 8 year old girl who was very much a tom boy. She loved playing with her older brother Jem and could very much hold her own. They lived with their father Atticus Finch who was a trial lawyer. Atticus Finch gets an offer on day to defend a african american man who was accused of raping a white woman. As much talk is going around the small town, Atticus is still able to set a great example for his children and beliving in what is right. There was alot of hate in the town and everyone wondered why he was defending this colered man. Nobody wanted to believe him. Atticus believed that the man was entitled to a fair trial and the whole town was very angry with him. As he stood his ground his children were there watching all of this and realized that nobody should be treated different just because of their skin color or anything different from anybody else. Atticus taught his children that you should not be ashamed for helping others and not letting other intemadate you. Overall I thought this book was great and it brings to reality what is true in this world.
B000069AUI|5.0|The Coldplay &quot; A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; CD is one of the best complete records ever produced. To listen to the layers of sound and detailed rhythms is truly a pleasure. To understand, concur and enjoy the messages in each song is simple.  Each song is not only lyrically satisfying but the music's tones, beats, rhythms and techniques are unique and remarkable.<BR>This is one CD that is worth the money!!!!
B00005JMFR|2.0|Came to the theatre today looking for more philosophical brain food for thought (similar to the Oracle and the Architect's dialogue in \\"Reloaded\\") than what delivered. Instead all the dialogue was just drivel, and many of the main characters (Morpheus in particular) were marginalized. The wagering between Morpheus/Trinity and the Merovingian created some excellent tension - which was negated, then forgotten.  E.g. his request to \\"bring me the eyes of the Oracle\\" as he toys with 2 martini olives on a toothpick. Makes you shudder, eh? And the subway-station limbo world was an intriguing setting that I hoped they would explore more; instead the Oracle wager is quickly abandoned and Neo is whisked away. <br />So, instead of true substance, the movie was overwhelmed with cliché and useless feely-good subplots. We have the overzealous (dare I say obnoxious) 16-year old who wants to fight in the war and somehow manages to outlast all the seasoned war generals. The Indian family that wanted to save their young daughter seemed an artificial ploy to extract some sympathy from the audience. And I wanted to bang my head against the wall during Trinity's long spiel to Neo, where all the old Hollywood \\"I love you\\" clichés are recycled. <br />The final fight between Smith and Neo in the rain seemed the high point of the movie - visually stunning and on par with the visuals of the prior films. But again, soo much potential that quickly plummets. It seemed the writers caught themselves in a bind here - both Smith and Neo have already proven that they are indestructible while in the matrix and thus cannot destroy each other physically. Then Smith seems to be hovering on the verge of existential crisis (lack of purpose) and I thought this would be cool, having his downfall rooted in the existential, rather than the physical realm. But no, we just get a series of inexplicable, blinding-white explosions. In the final scene we have characters I could care less about making cryptic comments and flinging the Sequel door wide open. So what, now there is peace? I.e. no more conflict between the machine world and humans, each just coexists? Do the machines continue to use embryonic humans to fuel their existence and the \\"awakened\\" humans are still relegated to their (now destroyed) underground lair? Seems to me the humans still get the short end of the stick...
B00005QIPH|5.0|When I say perfect, I dont mean free of flaws. This CD has its mistakes, as do most (there are noticeable similiarties to the Cure and the Velvet Underground).  It is however, the perfect FIRST album in the respects that the songs seem to just flow together.<br />I bought this CD after I heard \\"Is This It\\" on the radio, and I couldnt be more impressed.  I havent heard anything this good in some time, they offer a beautiful alternative to the junk you hear on the Top 40 type stations.  There doesnt seem to be any filler songs on this album, and I love that. Each and every song has amazing lyrics and great beats.  My favorites are Barely Legal, Hard to Explain and Is This It.  I wish they would've included 'New York City Cops' on the US release of this, because it really is a great song. <br />I do think it was a mistake that they chose to release both Last Nite and Someday as singles, because to me, they are the most similar on the album, and its given tons of people the impression that all the Strokes songs sound the same, when it couldnt be less true. To me, they just have an incredibly distinct style. <br />Part of what sets these guys apart from other groups out there, is the carefree look and attitude they seem to maintain throughout their rising fame. They also have a great sense of style. They always look like they've rolled out of bed...and it grants then automatic sex appeal. <br />I had the pleasure of seeing them live not too long ago, and they are *excellent*. They blow the quality of the CD recordings away, you cant say that about tons of other bands. It takes talent to be better live, without all the enhancements of the studio. <br />The bottom line is, the Strokes are one of the most promising bands of this decade. They managed to bring back some great elements of rock into this gangster rap dominated world. They are most definatly going to be around for some time.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|You know, I really dislike Britney.  Her voice has always taken a back seat to her body, and her completely apparent fakeness in interviews make me hate that she's become sucessfull.  That said, In the Zone can be fun.  Most tracks are so well-produced that you can ignore the lyrics and singing.  If Britney didn't try to be a vocalist (or artist of any sort) and let producers take over, *her* music would be great.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Wait Until Dark (Audrey Hepburn, among others) is a thriller that will make you sit on the edge of your chair, or on whatever else you're sitting. The suspense is very tangible and also increases during the movie, never fading.<br />I'm not sure about this, but I believe WUD is based on a play. If not, it will make a good one. The script is clever and the cast is just wonderful, with Richard Crenna playing an amiable Mike Talman (just amazing). Alan Arkin, who plays the many Roats, is far more sinister, but even this villain possesses a certain charm.<br />Now I must honor Audrey Hepburn, who deserves a paragraph of her own. So... It's her performance that really hits the nail. She plays a blind woman, and she's not to be underestimated...<br />Watch this, and don't expect a mere 'contemporary' horror movie. Excellent!
B000066NW0|1.0|I used to hate Avril Lavigne. I mean really HATE. Her image, her music, her videos, the total package sickened me to my self-righteous, music-loving core. I put the whole burden of the death of music on her shoulders, from the record industry going down the toilet, to the ridiculous lawsuits issued by record companies to unsuspecting Kazaa applicants, to the infuriatingly narrow-minded approach taken by music television channels and radio stations. But now I've finally bitten the bullet and shifted my loathing to a new extreme: pity. I figure that pity wounds pride worse than a simple &quot;You suck!&quot; ever could. So now I just smirk at her success, all the while feeling sorry for her. I feel sorry for the fact that she was suckered into embracing the passing fad known as 'Pop-Punk.' I feel sorry for the fact that her core fan base is little girls with disposeable income and a ten-second attention span. I feel sorry for the fact that she is completely oblivious to how the record industry is flaunting her ridiculous image to that same fan base to make a quick buck. I feel sorry for the fact that her Punk Rock credibility is so laughable that it renders her practically cartoonish. But most of all, I feel sorry for her. I feel the same way that Metallica did when they winced in pity as Avril weakly tried to rock out on their 'Icon' special. I can't hate her. It just seems cruel.
B00005JMFI|3.0|Will Ferrell, like most SNL alums, is like a old friend, you always have to go see what he's doing, even if you suspect it's basically no good.  I went into this with Mom, of all people, expecting it to be really awful. It wasn't. It opens up really cutesy, with some characters reminiscent of the old Rankin-Bass specials I still watch every year, especially the Snowman, now that was a treat. Buddy the man-elf crawled into Santa's bag, came to the North Pole with Ed Asner's Santa, got raised by Bob Newhart's (always brilliant) Master Tinkerer, and learns he's human, and sets off for New York. It not as predictable as you might think and Zooey Deschanel is really, really cute in her elf costume, and made liking Willie pretty believable, though even when he's shirtless or nude (Old School) you have to admire his drive to make you laugh, no matter what. Will Ferrell goes for the gusto, never holds anything back. I recommend taking your date to this movie, you'll thank me for it later.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Gangs of New York has a lot of problems. (1) Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio are miscast. They have no chemistry, Diaz' role is confusing, and DiCaprio appears to be stoned in almost every scene. (2) Their love affair is a needless distraction from the revenge plot. (3) The set design is amazing, but it seems to take up too much of the screen. It's anything but subtle. In Scorsese's other films, he creates a world to surround the characters, but he doesn't call attention to it. (4) The movie is split over two DVDs. There's no reason for it. I have other films of the same length on a single disc. The extras could have been placed on the second disc, and the entire film on the first. (5) There was a lot of controversy about the production of this film, including cost overruns and fights with the producer. That story is not mentioned anywhere on the two DVDs. It's a whitewash.<br />And then there are the good things. (1) Jim Broadbent and Daniel Day-Lewis are great. I could watch those two guys all day. They work the scenery, they work the costumes, and they know when to overdo it to keep the story fun and colorful. (2) All of the historical moments are well-done. Scorsese has a knack for cutting away from the plot, giving you background, and then getting back to his characters. The best example is Casino, whre he spent the first 45 minutes teaching you about Las Vegas. Here, he shows you everything from immigration to racism to corrupt politics and draft fees. (3) The movie is packed with stunning shots, such as the moment at the beginning when Bill's gang silently emerges from between the houses to form a mob in the snow. Or the climax, with cannons firing into the city and looters storming the mansions. (4) Scorsese's audio track is worth listening to.<br />Overall, Gangs of New York is a \\"chocolate cheeseburger\\" --- a movie that tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one. Scorsese should have edited it mercilessly, cutting out the romance (as much as possible) and paring it down to an ultra-violent 2-hour epic. He would have lost a few casual viewers, but they ended up offended or bored anyway. I recommend this to anyone who likes Scorsese movies, simply because its an important part of his body of work. But for those of you who stayed away because you thought you wouldn't like it --- well, you probably made the right choice.
B00005JMFR|4.0|I thought that the movie was great and i would give 4 stars out of 5. the thing that stroke me the most about revolutions was that how the special effects designers had advanced the special effects into another level. The fight between Neo and Smith was fantastic and i have never ever in my life seen such detail graphic designs in that seen. The ending was not what i had expected it did not make me belive that the triology its over i still think that there is something missing in that film i was not satisfied with the ending and so were some of my friends. It could had finished with something more symbolic and a knowing the future of Zion and the human civilisation. Happy with the special effects but not happy with the ending of the film.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Love Actually is a big warm fuzzy of a movie.  It's very touching and heartfelt.  Leave your cynical side at home and let the love wash over you!  My husband (romantic comedy avoider) and I both really enjoyed this movie.  I can't wait to buy it for use as a little pick-me-up on those days when it seems the world has gone totally dark.
B00005JMFR|2.0|Matrix should have stopped with the original.  The original was amazing.  I've seen in well over 50 times.  When I heard that number 2 and 3 were coming out I couldn't wait to have all my questions answered.  That, my friends, was a mistake.  The second one, left many questions still unanswered, making me want more, but still feeling sorely disappointed...I mean the car chase scene, the twins, the big room fight sequence: it was all good, but still was lacking.  Then last night, I get to go see Revolutions.  I was extremely excited.  However, I found myself increasingly more and more disenchanted as the movie went on. The action and especially the lines were so predicatable.  My wife and I found ourselves saying the lines before the characters themselves.  Almost every trite and overused scene, line, and concept was overused.  The effects were amazing and I believe the best ever in movies.  But like the Star Wars Episode I, great effects don't make up for a crummy story and bad writing.  I want my money back.

0385512104|5.0|This book is a murder mystery of sorts told by an autistic British teenage boy.  Christopher feels he has been framed for the murder of his neighbor's dog, and after the police take him away, he decides to find out who the real murderer was.  He begins to keep a diary of his conversations with his neighbors, and as he uncovers more information, he finds out some very interesting things.  Everything is not as it seems.<br />I really enjoyed this glimpse into the life of an idiot-savant gifted in math and science.  The diagnosis of autism has always intrigued me, and I remember doing a project on it in my masters' psychology program.  I am curious as to what part diet plays in the onset of the disease, as there is a theory that many of those diagnosed with autism actually suffer from celiac disease, and can be cured as a result of following a special no-gluten or processed food diet.  Just something interesting to think about.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for something outside the traditional story line.<br />The main character was slightly reminiscent of the Adrian Mole books, but that might simply be due to the subject matter.  Great book!
B00005JMFR|3.0|The film served well as a straight-forward action flick, but in terms of philosophical ideas, it brings little to the table. The appeal of the first two matrix movies was the fun matrix talk it contained, clever dialogue and logical views on choice, freedom, etc. The first half of Revolutions was fine, giving us hints of the philosophical talk and an abundance of action. What disappointed most of us is the fact that this movie took place mostly in the real world, which is a lot less interesting than the matrix. Fans of the movies loved seeing the gravity-defying stunts in the matrix, but we only get glimpses of that here. the final battle between neo and smith was a huge disappointment, full of explosions and collisions, but we all know smith can't die via neo's fists, so what was the point of the whole fight. i can tell you that smith is defeated, though this should not come as a surprise to anyone, but the way he was defeated makes little sense. the wachowski brothers, faced with a genuine opportunity to make a truly great conclusion, just resorted to the final face off. <br />the best scene in the whole movie was not the 20 min battle to save zion, nor all of the endless action sequences, but rather the small quiet scene at the train station where neo exchanges words with a middle eastern family. the last stand of zion, though visually stunning, is an obligatory scene that does not add up at the end. you will see why. the ending itself was murky, leaving more questions than answers. <br />performances in the movie were generally solid, though keanu reeves might want to find another emotion than just the stunned look he struts around with. smith is an interesting character, but we get little of him. the chainsmoking oracle lacks the warmth of gloria foster and morpheus and trinity both contribute little to the movie. monica bellucci was a huge disappointment, uttering only one line the entire movie. The merovingian, who was interesting in the second movie, gets one little scene in this one, allowing him time to eat only one olive. <br />i am not looking forward to a sequel to this trilogy.
1400049628|5.0|The Zombie Survival Guide is a great piece of satire.  It's written as a straight survival guide, complete with campy pen and ink drawings illustrating such vital points as keeping your hair cut short and the importance of physical fitness.  <br />What surprised me was how *good* the advice was!  If there were a zombie invasion, you could actually use this thing.  Let me put my review in context.  I live on a semi-remote parcel in South-Central Alaska.  I'm off grid, and I've learned about survival the hard way.  Much of the advice from Brooks rings true to my experience (though I have not encountered the undead yet).  Brooks even knows a thing or two about firearms, which isn't what I would expect from such a dazzling urbanite. He also offers sound advice regarding the need for clean water, food, and good off-road transportation.<br />Anyway, thanks to Brooks, I'm ready!  Bring on the hordes of undead!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Revolutionize your mind into the real world. The best of the best is here. I think this is the best Matrix movie ever made.<br />Sci-Fi, Action, Drama, Oh yah........ it was very sad when Trinity died. Neo the one himself saved Zion from the machines. Although the end of the movie was vague. Neo dies and Morphius and Niobie do not know of his death. And the deja-vu part ment there was a glitch in the matrix something changed, oh yes it did. The world was free.............Thank you Neo.................Wherever you are
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|I'm probably the only person that will speak my mind truthfully on this band. I'm sorry but they are the most overrated band of the last couple years. It just doesn't make sense why they are as popular as they are, and as for this latest album, IT'S BORING, and sounds exactly the same as their last. The singers vocals are mixed so low and have a filter effect, do to his lack of singing ability. I have also heard the strokes live, and it really doesn't make much difference. They are unimaginative, and are not doing anything break through. Their music style has already been done,so I wish media would stop<BR>making it seem like they are these KINGS OF ROCK??????(According to rolling stone) Also, shame on the record companies that concentrate their efforts on this mediocrity!
B00005JM02|5.0|This has got to be the best kids' movie ever made.It has great animation and sound.<br />This movie is about an overprotective clownfish searching for his son Nemo who was taken off of the reef by divers and brought to a dentist office in Sydney,Australia.Nemo's father,Marlin,is crossing the entire ocean searching for Nemo.Along his way he meats a forgetful but hysterically funny blue tang fish named Dory,three vegetarian sharks,a lantern fish,a field of jellyfish and a surfer turtle dude named Crush.<br />The DVD comes with 2 disks:disk 1 is a widscreen versian and disk 2 is a fullframe versian.Each dis has its own special features like the documentary:making Nemo or Mr.Ray's encyclopedia and much more.<br />Overall this is a musthave for adults and children alike.
B00005JLYW|2.0|This is bad!  Lots of action, lots of FX, lots of noise - but makes no sense.  The action is SOOO over the top, it is like a video game; the only place you could watch this stuff and buy into it.  The problem?  Unless you control the joystick - its stupid to watch!  I like Barrymore, Diaz and Liu, but all they do here, is change clothes, speak in third-grade-level double entendres and hang from invisible wires. (Damn Crouching Tiger ...!)  John Cleese?  Why is he here?  They don't even give him a funny line!  Bernie Mac (God Bless Him) tries really hard, but he is fighting a losing battle.  Crispin Glover?  Can anyone explain to me what/who he is in this movie?  I still have no clue.  An Demi Moore?  Well, she looks great and actually injects the most life of anyone into this puddle-deep film.  Her revenge?  She got lots of s**t for her 12.5 mil. payday for the awful Striptease.  BUT ... Cameron Diaz got 20 mil. for this!
B000003TAW|5.0|This is where it began. There is no cd I love more than this one. I have other bands I like more but this cd tops them. Say it ain't so has to be one of the best songs I've heard. Well for rock it is.
B00004T9UF|5.0|sheepnut, cranky reviewer and music fan are all the SAME PERSON??????<br />I realize many, many people don't get Eminem's irony, but he is what he is, and before you bought the CD, had you never heard of him before?  Didn't have a clue what to expect?  The reason he's been called a genuis is the way he laces together words that have weight into a melody that you have to move to.  If he wasn't a rapper, he'd probably find some other creative way to express the frustration of his life.  Millions are drawn to him, and it's not just angry young men who have been brainwashed by the violence-hungry media.  I'm a 40 year old woman, a mother, a professional, and I think he's brilliant.  I do not take offense to anything he says because I GET IT.  While the songs ARE about anger, frustration, &amp; violence, I don't believe he's ACTUALLY a misogynist or homophobe.  I think he's a man who has been let down by the very people he should be able to trust with his life and who claimed to love him, and he's getting it out through his music.  This CD is worth every penny, then some. I wouldn't let my 8-tear old son listen to the explicit version, but that's because HE'S EIGHT and doesn't understand much about irony and the weird little nuances of life and art.  But he will, and then I'll let him listen to whatever he wants to, because I will trust that I taught him what I thought was important to know (love, respect, compassion, honesty) and the rest is up to him.
0671027344|5.0|As I read other reviews of this book, I see that one aspect of the story has been left out. I can plainly see that along with Charlie's struggle with growing up, he also faces much depression and anxiety. Throughout the story, he finds himself fearing for his well-being. Charlie will often find himself wondering if there might be something wrong with him. His thoughts are randomn and out of control. He obsessives over things and he finds himself blaming himself for much that happens around him. As an avid observer of people, Charlie wonders about why certain things are done the way they are and why things are the way that they are. I feel that many people who find themselves struggling with these types of things will be able to truly relate to this story as I have.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD if awesome. If you're in a bad mood, you can listen to a piano-peice like &quot;Hello&quot; or if you're in suicide-mode, you can listen to &quot;Tourniquet.&quot;   <br />BUT a lot of people want to buy this CD. I warn you, a lot of these songs are not like &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; the rap/rock 'Linkin Park' song that you hear on the radio. Some are piano peices, or more rock, that does not include rap. I encourage you to borrow this CD/download some before you actually decide to buy it. <br />But I love this CD, something about Amy's beautiful voice and the combined selection of piano music and rock music makes you want to listen. My grades for this CD:<br />#1. Going Under--A+<BR>Good song to start off the CD, about betrayal. Rock song, with feeling. This is also Amy Lee's favourite song. One of the best songs on the CD.  <br />#2. Bring Me To Life--A<BR>We've all seen the music video, heard the song. Rap and rock in this song are an awesome combination. Also played in the movie &quot;Daredevil.&quot; Nuff said.<br />#3. Everybody's Fool--B+<BR>Not the best song, but it sort of shows the protential and basically what this rock band sounds like throughout the CD. Like past reviews mentioned before, this song brings you into the band.  <br />#4. My Immortal--A+<BR>One of the most beautiful songs I have honestly ever heard. It's a piano peice, with Amy's voice (of course). Amy and Ben wrote it when they were only in high school.<br />#5. Haunted--A+<BR>Lyrics are awesome. This song doesn't start off too rock as the rest of um though, but I think the beginning is awesome anyway. This is a very short song, and it also has a chorus in the background.<br />#6. Tourniquet--A<BR>A song that mainly focuses on suicide (but I've also heard it has something to do about drugs, but whatever). Rock, of course, and Amy's voice is especially powerful in this song.<br />#7. Imaginary--B+<BR>Not the best, but it does have pretty interesting lyrics. The middle of this song is very very nice though. It's sort of about suicide, but isn't as deep as &quot;Tourniquet.&quot;<br />#8. Taking Over Me--A+<BR>My favourite song on the CD. It starts out as a piano song, but then goes into rock. People said that this sounds like Linkin Park--I disagree. It's beautiful, and brings out Amy's voice. <br />#9. Hello--A+<BR>Beautiful song. It's a piano peice, like &quot;My Immortal,&quot; but isn't light and as colourful. Many people say that it's boring, but it does get better. This song really does show how beautiful Amy's voice is.<br />#10. My Last Breath--B+<BR>OK song, but rock and suicide (not like &quot;Tourniquet&quot;). The lyrics are good, but could use a little more work. <br />#11. Whisper--B<BR>Eh, I don't really like this song. It's rock, but I don't know whether or not to consider it suicide-ish. Even though the main chorus that Amy sings is good at the beginning, at the end the chorus singing in the background isn't as good. Lyrics aren't good either. But what annoys me most about this song is that at the end, you hear the chorus that were singing before singing something in latin and it isn't very clear (they're singing something like, &quot;save me from the dark, save me from danger). <br />Overall, I loved this CD, and I do reccomend it. =)

And I love them, mainly because if I'm going to have her zone out in front of the tv at all, I'd rather have her learning something in a format that she enjoys.<br />And, on top of all of that, these are enjoyable for the parents too!  Unlike some of the other children's programming out there, it takes a LONG time for me to get worn out on this one!

6305908648|4.0|This DVD is from a 1999 performance by Deep Purple, along with various guests, including the London Symphony Orchestra. They probably should have called it &quot;Deep Purple And Friends&quot;, for reasons that will soon become obvious. <br />The show gets off to a slow start, with two ballads featuring Purple keyboardist Jon Lord on grand piano and the orchestra. The first, Pictured Within, has a singer named Miller Anderson on vocals. The second song, Wait Awhile, features Sam Brown, a female vocalist who has recorded several solo albums, and has also toured with Pink Floyd as a backup singer. Neither of these songs is very good, and are the primary reason why I'm not giving this release a five star review.<br />After the dull opening, Lord and orchestra are joined by most of his Deep Purple bandmates, bassist Roger Glover, drummer Ian Paice, and guitarist Steve Morse, along with Ronnie James Dio. With this configuration (plus a few backup singers and violinist Graham Preskett) the group performs two Glover penned songs, Sitting In A Dream and Love Is All. These songs are drawn from Butterfly Ball And The Grasshopper's Feast, a conceptual work that Glover released in the mid 70's. It's interesting that the band would choose to spotlight such obscure songs, but I think in the end, these two songs are played rather well. <br />Following this, Dio and Morse both leave the stage, and the remaining three members of Purple and Preskett, plus the infamous Kick Horns (who ruined many a classic song when they toured with The Who in 89) tear into the classic Purple instrumental Wring That Neck. I suppose if this was someone else paying tribute to Purple, I'd regard this as a great arrangement, but I was expecting to hear Steve Morse play on this track. Like I said, it's a good arrangement, and I suppose the band gets points for trying something different. <br />After this, show the REALLY picks up steam, as they present Lord's Concerto For Group And Orchestra, a piece that Purple originally recorded in 69, and which hadn't played much since then, until circumstances brought upon the inspiration to resurrect the piece 3 decades later. <br />So, what does the Concerto sound like? Well, it sounds like exactly what I had imagined it to be, ie a mix of an orchestra playing classical sounding music with the classic Purple sound. Some of the orchestral interludes seem to go on a bit, but I think in general, it's very successful in mixing classical and hard rock music. There's a couple bits during the second movement, where Ian Gillan sings, but it's mostly an instrumental piece. <br />After the Concerto, the band performs a handful of 90's era songs, before ending the set with Pictures Of Home. The encore is, of course, Smoke On The Water, performed with the full cast of musicians, along with members of The Steve Morse Band and a second guitarist who isn't really identified (he's not mentioned on the back cover, though presumably his name is amongst those listed under the word &quot;Guests&quot; in the closing credits). Dio and Gillan trade off on vocals, and suprisingly, the orchestra, Kick Horns and even the back up singers (I HATE back up singers, what does a rock group like Deep Purple need back up singers for?) sound great.<br />To those who demur at the idea of Deep Purple without Ritchie Blackmore, I might point out Steve Morse is a genius. He's had a long career playing with The Dregs during the 70's as well as The Steve Mores Band and Kansas during the 80's. He twice got so sick of the business of the music industry that he quit and took a normal job, but found the pull of playing music too strong to stay away from his first love. He does a perfect job at filling Blackmore's shoes. <br />As I said before, the only reason I'm giving this DVD a four star review instead of five is because of the two boring Jon Lord songs that open the disc. I think it would have been better if they had started out with a few Purple songs, then the Concerto, then more Purple material to wrap up with. Maybe they could have stuck the songs the songs featuring Miller Anderson (WHO IS Miller Anderson, anyway?!), Sam Brown and Ronnie James Dio in the middle someplace, but I think it was a bad idea to start with them. <br />Anyway, I think this is a nice release, and once they get into the actual portion of the show that features Deep Purple, it's fantastic.
0345409671|5.0|Once again, Lestat and Anne Rice have brought the beautiful and sorrowful into a most luscious courtship. The emotions I felt through every word for all the characters involved, actually, was like water being washed over my every pore. The reader can really obtain a unique inside view into both Lestat and Memnoch apart from what they are, and feel really WHY and HOW they are, and why we love Lestat, in particular, so very much.
B00004Z459|5.0|Wow!I think I have listened to this cd 500000 times.And I think its the best.The mix of all the types of music is fresh and hot.Ive memorized each word.There is no one better than Linkin Park they are totally the best.If you are seriously picky then this is a picky cd.The songs are really something I think EVERYONE can relate to.No matter if you are 12 or 32!This is definitely a cd everyone should have.I should know I have alot of cds but this is the one permanently attached to my cd player.In the End was the 1st song I heard by Linkin Park.So I think it's my favorite because that one song sucked me into completely loving Linkin Park.Ask anyone who knows me...IM A FREAK!!!

B00009TB5G|5.0|First! The new Tolkein cult is assuredly more pious and zealous about their hero and his fantastic literary achievement. Please answer this: Is it more entertaining to over analyze, pick apart and find fault than it is to allow yourself to be swept up in and enthralling epic fantasy? I'll tell you this: There was NO LOTR/Tolkein cult until the re-realease of the Hobbit in the 60's. \\"Hey Maan!\\" \\"Have you dug this book yet?\\" \\"Mind BLOWING!\\" are but a little of what I heard as a young reader in the 60's and into the 70's when the \\"FAD\\" lost steam. We were Tolkein worshipers, my brother and I devised calligraphic and symbol derived signatures to be more like Gandalf and we were not silly kids then. If ones view of reality was skewed by chemicals (as many were) it didn't necessarily make the stories better. One could float away on a fantastic voyage (hey wasn't that a movie??) and I never heard anyone complain about the wide variety and individuality of opinions on what made these stories ring magical for them. We ORIGINAL \\"Culties\\" of TLOTR and the Hobbit, were however almost unanimous in our scathing condemnation of the cartoon versions of the film. Not so much for lost content, though that was troubling, as for the fact that cartoon characters couldn't catch the darkness, or the suspension of belief necessary to be carried off into another time and place. You see cartoons are inherently unbelievable and that is acceptable to us as we suspend belief for a while. However, in so much as the LOTR is already beyond our perception of reality, it is still a story rife with Judeo-Christian, Celtic and Scandinavian mythology and symbolism. And, cute little colorful and cherubic animated people don't make it easy to believe. And so LOTR on this deeper level is very approachable as literature. The written word gives you time to digest, reread, contemplate and discover and perceive in your own time and your own way. Through the written word one instills characters with one's ownperceptions, and enters into these characters as ones self with ones own set of experiences. Cartoons already divorced from reality don't readily allow this in the moving image business. We need human characters to convey us into the fantasy. We need to identify with them. <BR>Second, this new Tolkein cult: Sorry Peter but it is a cult conceived, created and marketed by commercialism and studio execs to garner profits. However Mr. Jackson let me not seem to diminish the accomplishment. This new cult drives itself and the \\"culties\\" are naturally more zealous than we were in our day, for the simple reason that they need to be perceived as the genuine article. To be seen as true followers of the WORD of Tolkein so to speak. Hey people just enjoy the books, and enjoy the film. I've waited nearly half my expected life for these films to be made and they are MAGNIFICENT to say the least. 25 years ago I mentioned to a friend in film school that I thought some day computers and CG effects may make it possible to make these films. I was almost right. It took blood, sweat and tears (dating myself again) and good filmmaking and human actors committed to the task and a man with a vision. CG just helped him tell a story. In the end, to address the reviewer from Garland Texas: Hey take a pill, relax and allow the epic to sweep you away. You will always have the books to retreat to when you're feeling vulnerable. When poorly conceived films tell a story already well told in print they often fall short. BUT, these are bad films and poorly told stories in and of themselves. One doesn't need to criticize to make ones self feel better about their opinion however, and I'm not criticizing you now, just pointing out that film is a literary art, but it isn't literature. Key point here: film is a medium with which one tells a story and therefore literary. It can be an art when done well and can even be extraordinary. Thank you Mr. Jackson you tell a good story Maann!
0679879269|1.0|My main problem with this book is that it left too many things unexplained... like if God was dying, then what was there before God?  The ideas that were put forth in the first two books led me to think that the author would have some magnificent explanation and ending.  I was severely disappointed.  The book was not cleverly written; the author seemed to be able to form the beginnings of a story but could not take us to a satisfactory conclusion.  It was an irregularly woven tale.
B0000AR8NK|1.0|The past 10-15 years or so i give new Bowie albums a listen out of pure curiosity. With the exsception of &quot;Outside&quot; most of these albums are the type you give a listen to and within 4-5 songs you basically give up.<br />  &quot;Reality&quot; has been no different in that respect. For some mysterious reason Bowie fans made some noise after this sad LP was released, and once more, i allowed myself to fall in the trap and give this new Bowie outing a listen.<br />  I really dont get it i must admit. People are calling this a &quot;re-invention&quot;? A &quot;great Bowie LP&quot;? &quot;One if his five best&quot;? I mean, what's going on here, is there some secret version of Realiyt that didnt reach my hands that these people are listening to, because, the one i did check out is an ultra boring one...<br />  Re-invention? Try J.Cash's &quot;The Man comes around&quot; or Iggy Pop's &quot;Avenue B&quot; for re-invention. Best album? Compared to what? Compared to fifteen years of failed efforts to revive an once great songwriter?<br />  Sorry but I'm not buying in folks.<br />  The only thing that can be said with certainty about &quot;Reality&quot; is that it's painfully insignificant, totally unhooky, majorly feelingless, a profound collection of utterly poor songs.<br />  Surely, there's a good reason why people keep tuning in to every new Bowie release no matter what dissapointing records he's been releasign for the past 15 years. The reason is that Bowie made a legend of himself in the early 70s in a very emphatic way that has basically outlived its creator.<br />  But people are giving up in droves in case Bowie is noticing (i tend to think he doesnt care).<br />  Sad, really sad to see an once great songwriter reduce himself to a classic case of has-been. But that's reality too.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Don't try to break it down.  Don't try to analyze it, or even think about it.  Sigur Rós certainly doesn't.<br />This album is full of gorgeous music without a message.  It has no political musings, it has no outward cries to anyone or anything.  All it is is music that exists to be listened to.  Not listened to with a fiery heart, or a keen mind, or anything else that could scrutinize or misconstrue, but just listened to.<br />To all those that say it's &quot;pretentious&quot;, you're obviously bitter about your own musical shortcomings and have fallen prey to the evil beast of pseudointellectualism, wearing its traditional thick, black rimmed glasses, anti-culture t-shirt, worn jeans and Carhartt jacket.  Shut up.  You know nothing of what you speak.  You can't enjoy it with tunnel vision and a closed mind.<br />It's not rock, it's not ambient, it's not classical, and trying to find &quot;influences&quot; or saying &quot;it sounds similar to Radiohead&quot; will just not do it justice.  This is not Radiohead.  This is Sigur Rós, and it is truly beautiful music for people who wish to listen to it and have their own experience.

B0000VD04M|5.0|.....there were MANY very amusing and amazing scenes that were edited out of the original VHS.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|It's been a long time since the release of Sarah's last record and I have eagerly been anticipating the release of Afterglow. On initial listen I was a bit dissapointed, I felt that it wasn't as good as Surfacing or Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Upon repeated listening however the coal turned to diamond, it's a beautiful record and a fine complement to the rest of her work. Highlights include Fallen, Answer, Stupid and the beyond gorgeous Drifting. If you are looking for music to your ears and your soul you've come to the right place.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie was the best one I have seen in theaters for years! The very first day it came out I rushed to the store to buy it. In about 6 days I have watched it almost 8 times! I loved the funny one liners and how every character had a personality that made them a joy to watch! It was an amazing movie and fun to watch!!   If you havent seen it yet dont even bother renting it just go out and but it that's how dazziling it is!
076790592X|5.0|&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; by Mitch Albom, deals with his weekly visits to his old college professor, Morrie, who was dying of the Lou Gehrig's disease. After graduation, Mitch was too busy pursuing his goals to remember about his promise to keep in touch but sixteen years later, after watching an episode of &quot;Nightline,&quot; which did a piece on Morrie, he made a trip to see Morrie one last time before he dies. It was a Tuesday and for the next thirteen Tuesdays, Mitch would be making weekly visits to see his professor. This was going to be Morrie's last class and Mitch is going to be his last and only student and the coursework would be a final thesis (the book). Each time Mitch visited Morrie, his old professor would be teaching him lessons on life - how to love, how to forgive, how to appreciate your loved ones and also his perspective on death. Morrie unlike majority of the people, was not afraid of dying and his mantra was &quot;when you learn how to die, you learn how to live.&quot; <br />His outlook on death was so unusual that Ted Koppel did three shows on Morrie for &quot;Nightline.&quot; Each time Mitch visited Morrie, his condition deteriorated to the point that he could barely moved his toe. And yet, Morrie was not one to wallow in self-pity and was in fact thankful, that he knew of so much of love. One of the most unforgettable moment for me was when Morrie held a memorial service for himself - before he died so that he could appreciate all the good things that people had planned to say of him.  <br />I really enjoy and appreciate this book for all its lessons. Mitch writes in a simple way, to deliver a most unusual message. Contrary to some reviewers who believed that Morrie's message was for the rich, the extremes, I feel that his message was for everyone. That love is the most important thing and make sure that you appreciate those around you before it is too late. One of Morrie's most memorable message for me was that even when a persondies, the relationship between you and him/her doesn't have to. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn.
0671027387|1.0|If you like an unbelievable, contrived plot, card board characters, and lackluster prose, this book is for you.  It took me four months to plod through this nonsense - and its only because I kept hoping the hype about this author would finally be realized - that and being anal about finishing books I start, no matter how drool and boring they become.  What does the nonsense involve? A plot by NASA to save itself by planting a fake meteorite under the Artic ice cap...to help save the presidency....YAWN!  Stink, stank, stunk!  At least it will save me from reading any more nonsense from this no talent (albeit rich) author.  Shows you that the Peter Principle is alive and well in best-seller dumb!
B0000VD04M|5.0|.....there were MANY very amusing and amazing scenes that were edited out of the original VHS. It's easy to see why this film is an Oscar winner; now with the additional footage, it should be an even more splendiferous flick. <BR>\\"Ed Wood\\" isn't for the chronically uptight, but, if you are cool (at all) you will dig it.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I have mixed emotions about this movie.  On the one hand, it was definately a movie that made ya think a lil bit.  An interesting, and often confusing, storyline that acts as a perfect bridge within the trilogy.  The fight scenes were a bit more daring at times, which helped fill in the spaces between important story lines.  On the other hand, it was almost TOO confusing, and also pretty cheesy.  Zion, which was only mentioned in the first movie, looked like some big religious/techno fest, with roots in Star Trek, as opposed to the underground army I had pictured.  The whole dance/sex sequence was too long, and just went over the top.  The scene at the end of the movie, where Neo (who can fly apparently) swoops down to save Trinity was damn stupid.  Did we really need that kind of sappy love crap?  I understand the two characters are in Love, but I think the rest of the movie showed us that.  Trying to prove to the audience just HOW in love they are by doing that whole \\"Trinity, I can't live without you...\\" stuff is just lame.  It was the one part of the movie where they were definately trying to make it look like the first, and failed at doing so.  <br />As for the ugly, well, I know these new computer effects are supposed to be the greatest thing to happen to movies since color, but during some of the scenes I felt like I was watching Shreck in High Octane mode.  Computer effects are great, when they're not over done.  The whole Neo vs. Smith(s) battle was a good idea to show some cool moves by Neo, but once the computer took over I felt like I was watching a cartoon.  It just seemed a lil tacky.  Most of the interstate scene better, except for Morpheus vs. the Agent on top of the truck--too much of it looked like computer animation.  Just didn't cut it for me.  <br />But, overall, the movie is entertaining.  I can't wait to see Revolution here pretty soon.  I'd kinda hope the twins came back, as they were a pretty tough duo who should've gotten more screen and story time.  Great villians are hard to come by.  And as great of a villian that Smith was in the first Matrix film, in this one he just seems annoying more than anything else.  I still don't quite get why he's there.
B000084T18|2.0|50 Cent has catchy tunes that one could listen to once in a while, just like many other hip hop artists out there.  Nevertheless hip hop just has to go.<BR>  <BR>     The time has come...<br />                           LONG LIVE ROCK N' ROLL!!!
6304806442|5.0|This is a movie about heroin addicts. So why anyone shocked that the movie is dark gritty and shockingis beyond me. This story is told by Mark Renton aka Renton. He and his friends are hopless and addicted to heroin and it isn't pretty. It's real. Mark's life is ruled by drugs. This movie dosen't try to make drugs seem cool or nice. It shows what hitting up can really do, what it really does.I don't think (I hope) that anyone saw this and said. \\"Geezs I sure wish I had their life.\\" This movie dosen't tell you drugs are bad.  It dosen't have to. I mean would you want to be Marcus or any of this friends? I liked that this move covred both sides. It wasn't just about drugs it was about life.How we choose to spend it. How the actions we take shape it.  to live it. Listen to Renton's speech at the opening. I mean did  the people who didn't use have any better of a life? You also got the feeling they were telling you drugs weren't the only thing you can abuse. If you think this movie is about glorifying drugs you've missed the whole plot. If anything this movie is anti drugs.And I love the way they didn't come out in a   after-school-specail-way to do it  The sceen with the dead baby, the toxoplasmosis and the taxi cab sceen should all stick vividly in your mind as reason not to ever want to go anywhere near smack. Over all this was just a good movie. One you'll remember long after you've watched it.
B00008PW2D|1.0|I was all set to pre-order this DVD as I have purchased the first four seasons.  But after seeing the other reviews and realizing this only has a shorten season but the regular price, I have decided not to buy it.  HBO is just too greedy.  I probably wont buy the remaining seasons either. I hope more people also skip buying this DVD.  That is the only way HBO will learn they can't rip people off like this.
0800196767|5.0|A fantastic movie based on the wonderful book by Roald Dahl.<br />Matilda (Mara Wilson) is a lovely and brilliant little girl, who is ill-treated and neglected by her disgusting parents (played by Danny De Vito and Rhea Perlman)<br />She go's to the library, to take books out, everyday, by four, and slowly discovers brainpower within herself (as the narrator reminds us, we only use less than a tenth of our brainpower-well not Matilda!).<br />Finally her father agrees to send her to school, a school which is run by the hideous and cruel psychopath Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris), who resembles something of Stalinist labour camp commissar.<br />Well, she certainly abuses the children, from swinging a tiny girl by her pigtails, to locking children up in a tiny dark chamber with spikes in the door.<br />By the way, this can all be very frightening to children of pre-school age.<br />But Matilda is shown love and care by her wonderful and sweet young teacher, Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz).<br />The most wonderful part of the film however is seeing Matilda see that the horrific Miss Trunchbull gets her comeuppance, and finding the happiness and love she deserves.
0743243307|5.0|\\"A man's character is his fate.\\"  With this quote from Heraclitus, Monica Ali takes us on Nazneen's 35-year fateful journey from her birth in 1967 in the Mymensingh District of East Pakistan to her independence in London in 2002.  As a newborn she did not nurse for five days yet survived. In 1985, at age 18, she marries a man 22 years older whom she had never seen, a man who had been living in England since the early 1970s.   Chanu needs her to cut his hair, his nails, and  his corns, clip his nose hairs, feed him, keep his apartment clean, wash his clothes and to bear his children.  When she is 21 she bears a son who dies after a year and then she has two daughters.<BR> <BR>Chanu is educated and she is not.  He has a degree from Dhaka University in English literature and is working for an Open University degree.  She knew no English. When she expressed a desire to go college to learn English Chanu said \\"there was no need.\\" What English she learned she learned from her daughters, who \\"demanded to be understood [in English].\\"  She lives in a cube, with thin walls, falling plaster, and two sinks, in public housing.  Her husband's ambition is humbled by the racial wall-at the age of  43 he resigns from his job in the council of  the local government.  After months of depression he determines to return to Dhaka and to raise money for his trip he becomes \\"driver number one-six one nine\\" for Kempton Kars. <BR><BR>It is Nazneen, however, who makes the money for the family with her sewing machine.  She has an affair with a younger man when she is 34, a man who brings her garments to sew and is a founder of an active Islamic group, the Bengal Tigers.  She learns about love from the wise Dr. Azad:  \\". . . 'there are two kinds of love.  The kind that starts big and slowly wears away, that seem you can never use it up and then one day is finished.  And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit to itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.'\\"  <BR><BR>Nazneen's younger sister Hasina, is always in the background.  She never leaves Bangladesh.  At age16 she elopes in a love marriage, a marriage that fails.  She works as a machine woman sewing garments but her beauty is too much and she is locked out of the factory, accused of licentious behavior.  She becomes a prostitute and marries Ahmed, one of her clients.  Family pressure causes him to later turn against her.  She seeks refuge in the House of Falling Women, run by Brother Andrew from Canada.  Lovely hires her as a nanny for her son and daughter.  Ultimately she runs away again with Lovely's young cook.  It is Hasina who tells Nazneen about their mother's suicide dressed in her best sari.  This is the mother who told her daughters \\"'If God wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men.\\"<BR> Although Chanu has been gone from Bangladesh for over thirty years, he pines for home.  He yearns for the sixteenth century, when Bengal was the \\"Paradise of Nations\\". When Dhaka was the home of textiles.  When the Bengalis invented muslin and damask.  In the Eighteenth Century Bengal provided one-third of the revenues of Britain's Indian Empire.  He is pushed to return home by the anti-Islamic hostility after September 11, 2001.   Chanu, at age 57, returns shortly thereafter without Nazneen and his daughter.  He has plans to go into the soap business and to gain self respect.  <BR><BR>The minor characters are fascinating and suggestive.  In Bangladesh, there is Makku Pagla, always reading and carrying an umbrella who kills himself by falling down a well.  There is Tamizuddin Mizra Haque the quiet barber who always knows the correct information about every thing.  In London, there is Mrs. Islam, the money lender with her two sons, Number One and Number Two, as enforcers.  There is Razia, Nazneen's closest friend whose husband dies when seventeen frozen cows fall on him in the slaughterhouse where he works.  Her response is that \\"I can get that job now.  No slaughter man to slaughter me now.\\"  Nazneen too becomes free for the first time with Chanu's departure for Bangladesh.<BR>The novel has considerable depth to it.  I strongly recommend it.
B000084T18|4.0|I have to say the album is decent.  I can listen to the entire album which is a feat to achieve in this age.  As impressed as I was, I thought 50 was lacking something throughout the album.  He was lacking his true creativity that you can only find on his mixtapes.  When 50 busts freestyles his lyrics are dope, and the flow is there, but when it comes time to go retail there's something holding him back.  50 has a lot of potential, but he and whoever is producing his ish needs to let it flow straightup.  Listen for this lack of flow in G UNIT'S Beg for mercy droppin on NOV 14 2003.  I hear it lacks the energy of their previous mixtapes.
0446530891|3.0|I am a huge Baldacci fan, and after &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; and hearing this was the 1st in a new series I was really anticipating this book.  Although pretty good, it certainly isn't his best work.  I recommend it to any fan of his, but do not expect too much.  It is a good read and think it is better than most author's work, just not his best.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used have developed a nearly flawless and perfect album. Every song from start to finish is awesome and full of emotion and energy. Though it seems odd to praise a lead singer whose main strength is a freightening scream, Bert McCraken takes listeners to a new height of musical emotion. The other band members blend together perfectly to make a flawless band. This CD is perhaps the greatest and most fun CD ever.<br />Maybe Memories- Very up tempo song, Bert quickly shows off his singing abilities and vocal range. The band also displays its unique rock music sound. 9/10<br />The Taste of Ink- A radio friendly hit. The song is very appealing to the ears and never seems to grow old. The dualing vocals by Bert are superb and the music flows very nicely. 10/10<br />Bulimic- The song is unbeleiveable. Nice opening guitar and the song suddenly takes off with a high pace. The chourus is awesome and the progressions of the song turn this into a very strong song. 10/10<br />Say Days Ago- This song takes off from the beginning with heavy drums and guitars. The vocals are amazing and the song has excellent feel to it. One of the heaviest songs on the album. 9.5/10<br />Poetic Tragedy- The band really shows its diversity and takes a different direction on this song. Very soothing and soft throughout the beginning of the song. The music creates an nice atmospshere and the lyrics and the vocals are perfect. Towards the end Bert takes over with his screaming and makes this song a masterpiece. 11/10<br />Buried Myself Alive- The number one single from this album. Everything about this song is perfect. The drums are awesome, the guitars sweet, and the singing flawless. The song has a rocking and uptempo pace to it. If you can't fall in love with this song, this music sytle is not for you. 15/10<br />Box Full of Sharp Objects- This song gives the band its image and put them on the map. It is crazy and FULL OF ENERGY. If you want to know what Bert McCraken's screams are all about check this song out. The music rocks and the song is a fan favorite. 11/10<br />Blue and Yellow- another single from the album. The song is very soft and peaceful. The piano at the beginning is amazing. Bert's vocals makes this song. He takes a simple song and turns it into something unbeliveable. 10/10<br />Greener with the Scenery- This is a beautiful song and seems to be a fan favorite. The music seems to blend perfectly with the vocals and the LYRICS. The words almost seem to be expressed in the music it's strange (you just have to listen). 10/10<br />Noise and  Kisses- My personal favorite. The drums are sweet at the beginning and the guitars take the song right into Bert's vocals. The lyrics are unbeleiveable and the music flows throughout the whole song. 20/10<br />On My Own- Peaceful song with beautiful guitars. Once again Bert's voice takes over and the band turns out another awesome song. 10/10<br />Pieces Mended- Awesome opening with a sweet mix of drums and guitar riffs. At first it appears that the music is what makes this song, but once again Bert doesn't fail, delivering heart-felt vocals. 9/10<br />Choke Me- This song is on the same track as Pieces Mended you just have to fast forward a little bit after the song. This is crazy, crazy song. Bert screams his throat out during this song and the music is crazy as well. Its an interesting song to listen to, but it's a bonus track for a reason. It's just a nice little add on and it's not as good as the other stuff--but hey it's cool. 7/10<br />Make sure you go out and get the Maybe Memories DVD. On the CD the best Used song ever is on it. Alone this Holiday is the most amazing song in the world. Also It Could be a Good Excuse and Zero Mechanism deserve to be on this album as they are awesome songs.<br />Go buy The Used-- You will fall in love with this music.
B000089RVX|4.0|Excluding Amy Lee's vocals, the reason all of us love Evanescence is because of Paul McCoy from 12 Stones. I actually don't think Evanescence is all they are cracked up to be... Let's face it, all John and Ben do is strike power chords. However, Ben has a few solos in the record, and they are a nice break from the power chords. I met them on Sept.12 when they were here in Atlanta for the Nintendo Fusion Tour. I actually met them by a meer coincidence where some dude about age 40 had an extra Meet and Greet pass. I was at the show for my dudes in Cold (Check them out). Cold should have headlined the tour..... Also check out 12 Stones. They rock! I hung with Paul McCoy and the guys on June 14, and Paul made me and my friends feel like royalty. Newayz, back to Evanescence..... The cd is kick-ass, but I just wish Ben and John would put more into their riffs and stuff. Later, y'all.
B00005JMFR|2.0|This story could be great if the W- brothers condensed it into one or maybe two movies. Two and Three may be condensed maybe not one. The first movie was fresh and innovative. Two and three dragged on and on. The whole concept and the theories were very interesting. I had to force myself to stay awake during the last two movies. The movie moved too slow at the beginning and too much special effects in the second part. What this movie missed was balance and a decent pace. Too bad because the concepts were really interesting and worthy to explore.  I had to step out for a couple minutes during the fighting scene for personal reasons and did  not to miss anythig...and that says something about how overdone something is.  Wait until this comes out in DVD and then skip the long drawn out battle scenes unless this is what you like most about the movie.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia shows how surviving principles, driven by a weak balance of stakeholders and principals, drives people into trapped constructions of live mostly without finding the need or way for what really counts. It's an amazing film when the brain allows a moving step to the next faze of live to be better of as defined by Abraham Maslow 1908-1970 with his Maslow theory.
0553213105|5.0|&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen is a classic that is well worth reading.  The descriptions of the characters and their interactions with one another truly make this book enjoyable and unique.<br />The book centers on the developing relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.  They start out disliking one another, but as the story unfolds, they begin to see each other in a different light.  Soon, respect for one another develops and eventually a love that is greater than either have ever hoped to experience.<br />The setting for this book is 18th century England, where there is a separation of classes: upper class, middle class, and lower class.  Elizabeth Bennet is from a respecatble, middle class family, whereas Fitzwilliam Darcy is from a very notable, upper class family.  Mr. Darcy sees any alliance between him or his friend, Mr. Bingley, and the Bennet family, as highly reprehensible in the beginning.  Elizabeth's oldest sister, Jane, is in love with Mr. Bingley and believes Mr. Bingley to be in love with her as well.  Mr. Darcy does not want his friend having any connection with the Bennet family, so he takes it upon himself to separate his friend from Jane and believes himself to be in the right to do so.  This upsets Elizabeth greatly and she refuses to have anything to do with Mr. Darcy, if she can help it.  Fate had something else in mind, though, and they kept getting thrown together.<br />The interactions between these two characters were, at times, very humorous.  Jane Austen developed them in such a way that I had to keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next.  She definitely did not disappoint my curiosity in wanting to know how everything would eventually turn out for the characters.<br />British Broadcasting Company, in partnership with Arts &amp; Entertainment television, produced the movie, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet.  I was so impressed with this movie after watching it on television, that I immediately went out and bought it.  It stayed with the book for the most part and really brought Jane Austen's characters to life.  It helped me to understand her characters and their situations even more.<br />This is definitely a book I would recommend to most anyone who is looking for a great, romantic classic to read.  It is my favorite book of all time and I look forward to reading it many more times throughout my life.

0783226063|5.0|Dune is the open door to fall in love with the whole Frank Herbert work. I was just a child when the dark and tragic vision of David Lynch made an impact in my life showing me a new whole concept of science fiction far beyond Star wars, more complex, deep and adult.<BR>            This time the good special effects wasn't the most important thing, not even the action, It' was the drama, the tragedy of Paul Atreides in his way to became a future messiah.<BR>            The best thing of David Lynch is the understanding of the whole universe of Frank Herbert making a movie that you can watch once and again finding new things.<BR>            The cast is the best they can found, far better acting than this trash for TV bad called Frank Herbert's Dune (is anything less a faithfully adaptation of Frank herbert work) and the soundtrack is amazing specially the love themes.<BR>             Forget the John Harrison brainless adaptation, the David Lynch version it's far beyond the common science fiction movie.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Words cannot express how wonderful &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; is.  Her solo debut marks a new and improved beginning in her career without The Fugees.  Amazingly, she compiles everything she's learned about R&amp;B music and expresses it as her own.  Most other artists don't compile her levels until they're in their forties.  Lauryn Hill was only 23 when she released this.  She combines ole skool R&amp;B, hip hop, and rap.  Her powerful message is wonderfully expressed on every lyric.  Such quality deserved her ten Grammy nominations, turning to five wins, including Album of the Year for 1998.<br />Every track is as deep and catchy as the following.  Her rap skills excels equally to her soulful singing as expressed on &quot;Lost Ones&quot;, &quot;Superstar&quot;, and more.  She shows her heavy soulful R&amp;B side on &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (the track), and more.  &quot;To Zion&quot; is a moving dedication to her son.  &quot;Forgive Them Father&quot; expresses her gospel affililiations without losing the catchy grooves.  Her #1 single &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; combines every musical quality on her album, giving it a new and unique theme.<br />After five years, &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; remains as fresh as the day it was released.  Many critics have hailed this as the best hip hop album in history.  They are right.  This will be a classic in the next following years.  This is an important album to put in a CD collection.  After listening to this, many will be highly pleased.
B00005JMFR|3.0|The Matrix Revolutions is a fine final movie, but it needed to have a more human touch and a better ending than it did. Keanu Reeves, Hugo Weaving, and the gang is back but the spectacle is gone, and the ending is must to be desired. Great special effects that do put the first two movies to shame, and the final confrontation between Neo and Agent Smith is a crowd pleasers. <br />It just needed more that it had to be a satisfying ending.
0783240287|5.0|This is the absolute best DVD production of all of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals.  The performances of the cast are excellent with special mention of Donny Osmond's outstanding performance who plays Joseph.  The music is good, the interpretation of this biblical story is unconventional, sincere, comical, and yet sad at the same time.  Your sympathy is obviously for Joseph but you find yourself being a little more understanding of his brothers' actions.  <br />I love the way the show is presented with its opening commencing in a classroom and then you are transported into the world of Joseph, his brothers, and the people of Isreal and Egypt, and then you are brought back into the  classroom at the end again.  This was done I presume to give the audience an awareness that the advent of this play was really in a school and of course Webber brought it to the world. <br />This production gives something for people of all ages to enjoy.  My 8 year-old nephew cannot stop watching it and while this production may not follow the bible to the tee, it is a great way of introducing a biblical story to a young child.  For an adult, you will appreciate the performances, the songs and the simplicity in which the show is presented but yet you finish watching it with a sense of awe and utter enjoyment.<br />If you love musicals, this is a must-have.  You will have no regrets.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Her voice is as sweet as ever. Fumbling is hard to beat, and I think that's the problem - people are comparing Afterglow to her last album(s). Instead of doing that, try listening with no expectations and just accept it for what it is, a gift from Sarah.<br />Fallen, Stupid, Trainwreck and Drifting are all great songs, but if you're still unsure check out Sarah's website and listen to the sound clips.
B000083E79|5.0|This is a compilation of Cher's greatest hits within her forty-year career.  With every track, she answers why many still love her and why she deserves her long reign.  Behind the extravagent outfits, she has a beautiful voice.  She shows the listeners how she's evolved as an artist through her career.  From easy listening pop(\\"Gypsies, Tramps, And Thieves\\") to dance/techno(\\"Believe\\"), her quality never fades.  She includes two tracks from her time in Sonny & Cher: \\"I Got You Babe\\" and \\"The Beat Goes On\\".  Her remake of the classic \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)\\" lives up to the original, as performed for her movie \\"Mermaids\\".  Her other movie single \\"After All\\", her duet with Peter Cetera, gives \\"Chances Are\\" a great name.  Throughout this compilation, she proves that she excels in many musical genres: pop, dance, and rock.  Such variety gives these classics the long lasting effect.  Her semi-new track \\"Different Kind of Love Song\\" is a great remix to end the album.  Regardless of how long she leaves the spotlight, her talents always and always will welcome her back to the mainstream.  \\"The Best of Cher\\" is a great compilation for any Cher fan.  This encourages many to anxiously await for her future projects.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded is not as good as the original classic but it's a very good follow up none the least. Keanu Reeves is back as Neo, the savior of mankind against the machines and Hugo Weaving is back as his archenemy Agent Smith. This is the second movie of the series, and while it does get too involve with its post-apocalyptic philosophies, it's a pretty good follow up.
B000094DUP|4.0|All I can say is \\"haha\\" to you Americans who love Delta. Bad luck to you that she isn't air-played on US radio, Neighbours isn't on your TV guide and you don't get a chance to meet her in person or see her win 7 gongs @ Arias. <br />Well if you reckon you know this girl. Then you didnt know that she's got a DVD out -\\"DELTA\\" which features live performance, videos + heaps of bonus stuff like documentaries. <br />And i bet you didn't know that her debut single was actually release in November 2001. Yes 2001. And the song was \\"I Don't Care\\" written by Steve Kniper. I think it also featured \\"Love\\" & \\"Here I Am\\". The single didn't take off Delta's careers, but then in 2002, she was signed onto Neighbours and then everything went sky-rockettin'. \\"Born To Try\\", \\"Lost Without You\\", \\"Innocent Eyes\\" & \\"Not Me, Not I\\" = all number #1 singles on ARIA -offical charts. She also won 7 aria gongs! <br />\\"I Don't Care\\" is on \\"Delta DVD\\", but not \\"Innocent Eyes Album\\". The record company and Delta Goodrem said the song didn't represent Delta -no piano pieces in the song. And the song/image was very Britney. Thankfully the song wasn't a success or else Delta might've gone into the wrong direction musically! <br />Well let me inform you on some more info: <BR>Delta is gonna release \\"Predictable\\" -a reindition was sung by Cosima deVito on Australian Idol. The single will include a new Delta song: release Dec1,03<BR>\\"Merry X-Mas (War Is Over)\\" which is a reindition of a song by John Lennon. So for you American and English fans please envy me!!! haha. I single also includes a piano/orchestra version of the inspiriational song, \\"Here I Am\\" -B-side to her debut \\"I Don't Care\\". <br />Just joking! America -you got to see Kelly Clarkson grow thru American Idol, i didn't and I'm a huge fan of hers!   :( <BR>And UK -Emma Bunton is getting big there I heard, here her songs are even available for sale! :(
B00005JMFR|5.0|First than anything, Matrix is a show. Just a show. You go to the cinema and watch it to have fun. It is not the Bible, it is not the Quram.<br />I went to see Matrix Revolutions almost in a forceful way (since i saw Reloaded, i had to see revolutions). I was very dissapointed with Reloaded, so i went with no hope.<br />However it was a nice surprise to see the characters becoming more human and real. Even the programs (the indian character, Smith, the Architect) show a lot of complex emotions and feelings, sometimes humorous, sometimes heart-touching.<br />Neo is no longer all powerful, and that brings life again to the movie, since you don't know what's going on next. That will keep you at the edge of your seat most of the time.<br />It was easy to recognize elements taken from many other sci fi movies (Aliens, Star Wars, even Dragon Ball and other Anime in general).<br />And the fun thing is that it makes you think. Not a lot, of course (this is a blockbuster movie), but it will keep going in your head for a while. It was worth to see Reloaded just to understand Revolutions (as it was worth to see the awful The Phantom Menace to understand the Attack of The Clones).<br />Should you watch this movie ?<br />If you saw Matrix 1, and you liked it, then you'll have a great time with Revolutions, since it closes many circles that opened in the first movie. If you didn't enjoy Matrix 1, there's no point in watching Revolutions (and don't even bother with Reloaded).
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I just can say this album is one of the best cds this year. It's difficult to hear a such deep, refined, adrenalinic music.. Thirteenth step puts you down into the deepest hole and rises you up to clouds in a few seconds. Guitars are not only powerful and wicked like Smashing Pumpkins' sounds, but even light just like Robert Smith of The Cure could do, and like the best James Iha did in Mellon Collie.. Plus, Maynard's melodies have something special that no one else can have.. they're simply wonderful. You must have this cd..
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the first Matrix movie and it's really the best. We are introduced to Neo, and the gang, as well as the evil Agent Smith and we are put into the war between man and machine. The special effects are ground breaking and the cinematography is as well. This is the first of the trilogy and its still with out a doubt, the best.  <br />It's followed by Matrix Reloaded, and Matrix Revolution.
B0000C4GQV|5.0|I'm a long time metalhead and Machine Head fan.  I have every CD they have ever released as far as I know.  Anyway, the new one exceeded my expectations by so far its insane.  It captures the original MH edge, and adds melody, and complexity.  BME was amazing in its day, but TTAOE is better overall.  By far the best CD I've bought in a long time, out of hundreds.  Standouts on this CD are Imperium, Bite the Bullet, and In the Presense of my enemies.  The double bass is back, heavy solos are back....do yourself a favor and FIND a copy of this one NOW!
B0000931QR|3.0|Acabo de regresar de España y es increíble el éxito que tiene éste grupo allí, se escucha todo el día y a cualquier hora por la radio y en la TV su video dá vueltas una y otra vez, especialmente la canción 'Rosas' su segundo single luego de 'Puedes Contar Conmigo' que fue el primero.<br />No sé a que llaman ROCK los españoles; pero les aseguro que de Rock esta banda NO TIENE NADA, NADA DE NADA.<BR>Sus letras son un tanto &quot;cursi&quot; (snobbish, a la Robbie Williams in the UK) dichas de una manera que NADA TIENE QUE VER CON EL VERDADERO ROCK ESPAÑOL, que sí hay en España, pero que ésta banda nada tiene que ver con eso. Es más bién un Pop blando lleno de &quot;cursilería&quot;, aunque debo admitir que su música es realmente muy pegadiza y contagiosa, pero NO ES ROCK.<BR>Música entretenida, para regalarle a alguna noviecita ilusionada, nada mas que eso: BUEN POP CURSI.<BR>(if you like The Cranberries, you'll enjoy this band).   &gt;&lt;((((°&gt;
0140277447|5.0|First I want to say this book is a vivid account on the massaccre. If you still don't understand why the Japanese refuse to admit to what their army did at that time, just read the book reviews from the Japanese readers. <br />But rather I would like to point out something I discovered among the reviews here. As I scrooled down to read more reviews from other readers, I found something really interesting. I noticed that almost all the one-star ratings get positive responses. (ie. a large portion of the readers say the rating is helpful) On the contrary, most of the 4 star or 5 star ratings get a negative response, for example, 5 out of 50 readers find the review not helpful. This applys to some well-worded reader reviews. This is highly suspicious. It seems to me that someone who hates the author of the book and the facts presented in the book are intentionally giving manipulated feedback to other readers. Since Amazon cannot track who rates the book and who evaluates the reviews, readers should be more cautious.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Let's get it straight..except for a 3 minute battle between neo and agents the first hour is just talking...and the second hour is half talking....but when the action starts its priceless..Neo vs 100 agent smiths's was awesome...the 15 minute freeway battle was also great and the battle in the french guys(i forgot his name..mera something...)palace was good too and the last scene....Other than the Action..movie is pretty flat....3 stars..fair
0380733358|5.0|Ken Follet's Eye of the Needle was an extraordinary book about a German spy named Faber, who knows the greatest secret of the Allies.  If he gets the information to Hitler than the war is most likely to be won by the Nazis. <BR> <BR> It is a race between Faber and many intelligent Allies.  Two of them, Godliman and Bloggs have traced back many murders and crimes to Faber and are always close to catching him but somehow he always finds a way to escape.  They both know that The Needle, Faber's codename, is very important and close to Hitler because he ends his letters with , Regards to Willi.  <BR>Which most spies would never be that casual with their leaders.<br /> Follet also tells the story of two of the important people following Faber.  Godliman was a professor before the war started and throughout the search for Faber he remembers seeing him somewhere when he was younger.  Bloggs is young and has just lost his wife in a bombing.  He blames every Nazi for this and will doing anything to find and kill Faber.<br /> Follet also tells of a young couple who are living their lives on a small cozy island with their son while all of this is going on.  David, the husband, was going to fly a plane for the allies but got in a car accident and lost his legs.  They both act happy when visitors come but Lucy, David's wife, knows there is something missing between them. <BR> <BR> The Needle ruthlessly kills anyone that gets in between him and the Fuehrer.  He even kills people on his own side.  That is the reason, though, that thousands of people are looking for him but no one can find him.  Follett adds an interesting pattern at the ends of the chapters that The Needle kills someone end with the phrase \\"You saw my face.\\"<br /> You do find out he has a heart, though, at the end of his mission when he crashes on a lonely island.  For once, he hesitates to kill someone.  <br /> This book is definitely a page-turner and has a very intense plot filled with adventure, suspense, andromance.  It keeps you interested from the very first page to the very last.
B00005JMFR|2.0|This movie went wrong in so many ways...Neo is missing in the movie for 45 minutes.isnt the movie about him?..while he is missing an over animated battle between the humans and machines is occuring...second Neo is blinded in the first half of the movie and he puts a purple bandana over his eyes making him look a ninja turtle.third was it me or did the machine god look like the wizard of oz????..come on now...and why was agent smith laughing like Dr Evil????..this was more a comedy than drama...i give it 2 stars for the cool final battle between Neo and Smith which was really weak but cool water effects....shame shame
B0000C6E4D|5.0|How can you rate Sarah if not with five stars?<BR>&quot;Afterglow&quot; is an album describing mature love, after &quot;Fumbling&quot; described the leaving of adolescence and &quot;Surfacing&quot; the entering of a new love dimension. It resembles to &quot;Fumbling&quot; for the steady inspirational tension (there's no weak songs on it) and to &quot;Surfacing&quot; for the sound. Difficult to pick up a favorite: &quot;Train Wreck&quot; if you're looking for Sarah's usual sensuality or &quot;Push&quot; if you're looking for her usual tenderness. &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Stupid&quot; if you are looking for &quot;Fumbling&quot;-themes. &quot;World On Fire&quot; is new and unexpected for Sarah: written by her and Pierre Marchand, this are so far the most beautiful September 11-related lyrics to me (and I've adored Bruce Springsteen's &quot;The Rising&quot;).<br />Definitely worth the wait, and for the ones who say it's too short...remember Joni Mitchell's &quot;Blue&quot; was only 36 minutes and also ten songs long!
B00000F566|5.0|From the time I was a little kid, I have loved this movie. Having it on DVD is even better. You get a ton of special features, including Patrick Swayze's music video! Plus you don't have to worry about the end of the movie going fuzzy from watching the tape so much! Trust me, it is worth it to have this classic on DVD.
B00005UKKF|1.0|If I wanted to listen to her lip sing I would have just listened to the darn CD. This dvd is a total waste of money. She doesn't sing, just dances around moving her mouth to the music, proving she has no talent other than dancing around in skimpy outfits. I'm not impressed at all. Wish I could get my money back.
0156027321|4.0|Great story of isolation, survival, and realization of creation.  The story will begin an internal debate of what religion best describes God.  If you've ever spent more than a minute believing the world may evolve around you, this story was written for you.  Yann Martel did an excellent job of putting the reader in Pi's world.
6305291489|5.0|This remake of the original Parent Trap was no disappointment. In fact, and some might disagree, I think that it is just as good. I absolutely love this movie! <BR>Annie and Haley are twins who are seperated at birth by their divorced parents. They each grow up never knowing that they have a twin sister - until a freak meet up at camp. They switch places so that they can find out what they have been missing with the other parent and then devise a plan to get their parents back together. <BR>Great movie, great cast, great acting - and the script holds up very true to the original. Great for a family movie night!
B000063COX|3.0|Iron Maiden exploded onto the scene of the NWOBHM with the 76' recordings known as the soundhouse tapes.  They quickly earned a fearsome reputation as a live band, and it was obvious that their debut CD was going to be a cracker.  While not the best maiden CD, its one of the most essential recordings ever made.  Fronted by then vocalist Paul Di'Anno and with guitarist Dennis Stratton; Maiden were a rising power already.<br />Prowler 9/10 A riff-mongous start to the album, one of the most catchy guitar parts of all time, and an amazing solo to go with it.  Maiden show off their soon to be signature time changing as well.  Catchy melody, strong chorus as well<br />Sanctuary 8/10 Originally not on this CD, but a bonus to the enhanced versions, its a live staple, but heavily heavily overrated.  Similar to Running Freen in this aspect<br />Remember Tomorrow 9/10 RIFFS!  Some fantastic guitar workings, with some added lyrical poignancy, ah, who said Paul coudn't sing?<br />Running Free 7.75/10 The 2nd most overrated maiden track of all time probably, very decent, a simple rhythm with a catchy melody, i dont remember a solo in this song....  but i like the lyrics, and it IS a catchy one.<br />Phantom of the Opera 10/10 THE epic that started it all, a monster 7 minute long piece with amazing guitar work, amazing solos, blazing riffs, catchy chorus, and one of the most BEUTIFUL instrumentals in it.  Paul also shines, i only have one complaint about this song.  the chorus is only played once, i would have loved to hear it twice, but o well, still an amazing track.<br />Transylvania 9/10 First maiden instrumental, nuff said.<br />Strange World 9/10 A SOFT? maiden track?  gasp, must be no good right?  Nahh, a laid back song with nice vocal work, but it actually dosent rlly stick in youre mind at all<br />Charlotte the Harlot 8.5/10 Begins with a kind of stupid kiddy riff, first saga of the charlotte series, a decent song, with a nice instrumental, Murrays first attempt at writing a full song.  Not bad, but we're still recovering from Phantom.<br />Iron Maiden 8.5/10 THE MOST OVERRATED MAIDEN SONG OF ALL TIME.  Nice riff, but i just hate that pounding snare drumm (no offence clive), but does maiden need to play this song at EVERY single concert?  Nahhhh, but its still got a pretty good chorus, but way to redundant, with only ONE verse!  <br />Maidens first attempt is not immediately catchy, in fact the only really amazing song is Phantom of the Opera.  But as far as first albums go, this ones a winner.
B00005OM4N|1.0|You're kidding me, right? THIS IS NOT MUSIC PEOPLE!!! She is some corporate created no talented girl who has to push her[self] in everyones face to stay in the spotlight. This album is a waste of money. There is not an ounce of vocal talent on the entire album. Yes, Britney is beautiful. But who cares? There are a ton of beautiful girls out there...
B0000931OL|4.0|this album is a tough album to review without looking backwards into the band's previous records. if you have followed this band since their debut album (like i have) then it should not surprise you that blur have changed their sound again. alot of blur fans feel that their best work lies within their &quot;modern life is rubish&quot; and &quot;parklife&quot; albums...and they may be right. but one cannot deny the impression this new album leaves after repeated listens. and i think that is the key element: repeated listens. i was slagging on this cd really bad when i first previewed a few songs off of it. coxon out? no! how could this band stand without the distinctly unique and tasteful playing of their main guitarist? well...quite simply, they've made an album that does not require a guitar. sure...there are splashes of six-strings throughout these songs...but the songs never rely on them. there's alot more rhythm involved and alot of interesting production ideas. alot of these ideas seem grounded in old turkish rock of the 60's mixed with a certain dj sense. there is a great dusty musty creaky feeling to &quot;think tank&quot; which gives me images of ratty acoustic instruments being played by strange peyote desert spirits. there are  a few songs that do not work here...namely &quot;we've got a file on you&quot; and &quot;crazy beat.&quot; these are  both good songs on their own, but they seem off balance within the context of the rest of the album. and the lyrics have a tendency to be on the edge of too much or not enough...i don't know. but this album has grown on me deeply and i would love to see graham coxon rejoin the band as they pursue this new direction. as a sort of a tease and a bonus, he is heard on this album playing on the last track 'battery in your leg'..which is an absolutely gorgeous ballad that would not have worked without his sprawling spiral guitar lines. listen to this album..then listen again. you'll find something worthwhile in this think tank.tank.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This story has been told about how many times? Probably a million, right? - okay maybe less. But who cares? Because it's not the story you tell but the way that you tell it that counts. This is a great movie. The story is about an engaged-widowed-working mother who is constantly bickering with her funky-opinionated-guitar-playing teenage daughter. An older chinese woman sees the two fighting and decides to interject by putting a curse on them which causes them to switch places. When they wake up in the morning, the daughter is in the mothers body and the mother is in the daughters body. They have to try to go about eachothers day without bringing notice to anyone else that anything has changed all while trying to figure out how to get back to their original bodies - and they have to do so soon - the mother is set to get re-married the next day and the daughter is scheduled for a pivitol band audition. But, what starts off as a curse just might be a blessing in disguise when each has to be in the others shoes for a day. <br />This movie is a really great family movie. Kids love it, adults love it. What mother and daughter can't relate to this movie? Highly recommended!
0671673009|3.0|It has been many years since I read this book and reread it. There are definitely some truly wonderful tools, which I have kept with me ever since I read the first line of the book... Life is difficult. As soon as one reflects on this fact and accepts it, it really isn't so difficult any more... <br />Of course I now realize-after having gone through some very painful experiences since I first read those lines-that this is an over-simplification. Life can and does throw some serious curve balls that really knock the wind right out of you! Realizing and understanding that life is difficult, is not enough of a tool to get you through loosing someone to death... Because there are all kinds of disturbing and hellish emotions that go along with loosing someone that you love so very much.<br />For anyone who was raised with any kind of a religious background, this book does not provide enough reasons as to why we feel the way we do about life's circumstances and our own roles here on earth. The messages that many-if not most of us have been given as children-from our parents and mentors can be quite confusing and contradictory. These messages stay with us, and as twisted as some of them may be, influence many of our decisions and keep us spinning within that vicious sphere. <br />If you have bought this book or are thinking of reading it, I say, go ahead and read it. It probably will give you some insight and some good tips on coping with life. But if you are seriously searching and trying to change your life, I would strongly recommend The New Dance of Christ by Anthony T Massimini. <br />The New Dance of Christ is a wonderfully, insightful book which will really blow your mind! I do wish that the title were different though. I consider myself a Recovering Catholic and no longer even consider myself a Christian. If it weren't for a friend of mine recommending this book to me, I would not have picked it up because of the title.<br />But don't be swayed by the title! Because even if you don't agree with all of the theories of Massimini, you can't help but be intrigued, fascinated and even altered by his words and facts... Whether you are a Christian, Buddhist, or even an atheist, this book will unlock something inside of you that was there all along but blocked and un-nurtured.
B00000JPH5|5.0|I grew up watching this movie almost daily. I absolutely love it.<br />Sarah (A young an then unknown Jennifer Connelly) plays Sarah, a teenage girl wrapped up in a dream world who wishes that her baby brother be taken by the Goblin King (played by David Bowie). But when he is actually taken she is shocked. &quot;I didn't mean it!&quot; she says!  The Goblin King gives her 24 hours to find her way through the labyrinth which leads to his castle, where he is keeping the baby - if she does not make it he will turn her baby brother into one of his goblins forever. So, Sara embarks on a journey where everything that could go wrong does go wrong all while making a great bunch of muppet friends along the way. <br />Everyone that I know that has seen this movie has a ton of fond memories of it. How could you not? It's one of Jim Henson's greats! Recommended for the whole family! Young and old!

B0000AQS6R|5.0|So funny it will make your gut and facial muscles hurt! In the tradition of the other NL vacation movies, Chevy Chase is on a mission to create the BEST Griswold holiday ever! From stapling himself to the roof, riding on the worlds fastest sled, and putting a Christmas tree through his humbug-neighbors window - this movie will keep you laughing all the way through! A great movie to watch to get into the holiday spirit &amp; shake off those Christmas frustrations ... and it's funny enough to watch even if it's June!!!
B00008H2LE|4.0|This album is awesome! It is not as good as 'Hybrid theory' in my opinion, but it is still an outstanding effort by Linkin Park; the best band to come along in years.  Here is how I rate the songs:<br />1) Intro-Ok Intro.  It is too short though. It seems it should have been part of the next song. 5/10 <BR>2) Don't stay- AWESOME! *****.  This is what Linkin Park songs are all about.  The guitar will blow you away!  My favorite song on the whole album. I don't know why, but it reminds me of the movie 'a clockwork orange', particularly the scene with the Ludivigo technique. 'forget of memories, forget of possiblities.  What you are changing me into'.  If they ever remake ACO, they should play 'don't stay' on it during the brainwashing sequence.  10/10<BR>3) Somewhere I belong-Hell yeah! another great song! The guitar is awesome! The lyrics are pretty good too. 'I won't ever feel anything else until my wounds are healed'.  I think I relate to this song.  I have a lot of darkness in my past that I want to forget too. 8/10<BR>4) Lying from you- Pretty good! Not as good as the previous two songs, but the guitar is still superb.  Go homeboyz! 7/10<BR>5) Hit the floor- Oh yeah! the second best song on the album.  'One minute you're on top, then you hit the floor. Making it non-stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone' Coolness! 9/10<BR>6) Easier to run- Not bad, guys.  I love the guitar; it reminds me of 'crawling' a bit, and the lyrics are pretty cool. 'It's easier to run, replacing this pain with something more'.<BR>7) Faint-One of LP'S Rap/rock combos.  It All right, but not as good of the other songs.  6/10<BR>8) Figure 09-Pretty good, not great.  7.5/10<BR>9)Breaking the habit- My least favorite of the whole album.  It reminds me of the fag street boys.  'I'm breaking the habit tonite'.  Still, it is LP, so I'll give it an extra point. 5.8/10<BR>10) From the inside- Good, but not great.  The guitar is awesome, but the chorus lacks. 'take everything from the inside and throw it all away' 7.5/10<BR>11) Nobody's listening- Meh.  I'm not a hip-hop enthusiast, but this is all right.  'but nobody's listening....'6.8/10<BR>12)Session- OK.  Another of LP's instrumentals.  Not cure for the itch, but all right. 5.8/10<BR>13) Numb- Here we go! This song will make you 'numb', that is from dancing! Hell yeah! 9/10<br />All in all, an awesome album.  Yeah, it has it's flaws, but that hasn't lessened my opinion of Linkin Park.  Also, the music video of somewhere I belong on the enhanced CD has excellant choreography.  I don't understand these people that think that LP is just yelling.  All rockers yell, for christ's sake!! So ignore the nay sayers and go out and get this kick ass CD.  You won't regret it.
B00005JKG7|5.0|I have only seen this movie once, but I remember it clearly because it scared me so much. I heard good things about htis movie, and I decided to give it a whirl. And I ended up watching it late at night with some friends, and I could barely get any sleep! The way it was filmed and the way the story goes it what I think makes this such a frightening movie. And it's not like other horror movie, it has some class and it gives genuine scares and chills. The acting was good and the music and picture quality was terrific! The images of some of the ghosts looked as real as they could, and it was just a fun/good/exciting, and lets not forget, horrorfying film. This is one of the best. I guess a true classic never dies...
6305127689|4.0|This movie is unbelievable and anyone that says otherwise is ignoring raw human instinct after all this is all that this movie is raw instinct.  This movie is filmmaking at it's most basic in every aspect.  The chorography the dialogue the soundtrack the way the actors move in the movie all just basic raw emotion the way it gets to you no thought is needed.  The lighting is so good it's bad the dialogue is so cheesy it's good.  If you get the DVD go to title 1 chapter 16 this might be the best few minutes of movie ever filmed.  The movie so plainly puts out the idea that Maverick is a wild man that doesn't do any thing by the book.  The dialogue by Kelly Mcgillis, &quot;My review of your flight performance was right on, but I held something back I see some real genius in your flight performance Maverick, but I can't say that in that taxpayers I was afraid everyone in that taxpayers room would see right through me and I don't want them to know that I've fallen for you.  Title 1 chapter 16 has the best movement of characters in a movie I've ever seen.  How the character of Hollywood leans in to talk to Maverick in the class to say &quot;gustiest move I've ever seen man&quot; and how Maverick kind of shrugs his head.  How after the class Maverick is walking a few steps ahead of Kelly Mcgillis with that cool 80's walk.  How Charlie chases after Maverick in her car how those cars at the intersection perfectly stop.  The way that Charlie's car comes to a skidding stop the way Maverick walks over to her car the way he takes of his sunglasses.  The whole love scene that follows I mean this is art.  Every film student at NYU should take a whole course in these 5 minutes of Top Gun.  I mean that it so beautiful I want to shed a tear.

B0000C6E4D|4.0|The American buying public remains in this day and age that most fickle of animals, and many artists react with the changing times in order to keep up with their ever-changing audiences' tastes.  So I guess we can give Sarah McLachlan at least a little credit--she hasn't changed one bit in the ensuing six years since she hit big with SURFACING and the accompanying Lilith Fair extravanganza, staying the course with her now trademark brand of ethereal folk-pop.  AFTERGLOW sounds like it could have been recorded at the same time as SURFACING--or SOLACE or FUMBLING TOWARDS ECSTACY, for that matter.  So it's safe to say that McLachlan doesn't do the musical makeover that old colleagues Jewel and Liz Phair have undergone with recent efforts.  The fact that she breaks no new ground becomes moot the minute she unleashes that glorious wonder of a voice--in a time when female singers sound either mechanical(J.Lo or Britney) or overwrought(Christina), McLachlan's soprano remains an instrument of unfettered purity.  It's further helped by the fact that she's got a pretty swell batch of tunes this go-round--highlights being the unjustly ignored first single &quot;Fallen&quot;, the 911-driven &quot;World On Fire&quot;, and the emotional whirlwind &quot;Train Wreck&quot;.  In the end, AFTERGLOW reaffirms McLachlan's continued relevance in an everchanging musical world.

B000089RVR|4.0|Though a very solid effort in its' own right, Dido's NO ANGEL didn't hit big until Eminem sampled her &quot;Thank You&quot; for his track &quot;Stan&quot;.  Fortunately, superstar assistance is not needed for LIFE FOR RENT, which not only outpaces NO ANGEL on an artistic level, but will hopefully prove Dido to be no one trick pony.  Indeed, first track &quot;White Flag&quot; is easily her best single to date--and it's not even the best track on the  album. That would be the electronic-laden &quot;Stoned&quot;, though it's followed very closely by the title track and &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot;, all of which have not only gloriously hook-filled melodies but first-rate lyrical content.  The rest of the set is lyrically strong, though lacking the immediacy of the aforementioned tracks.  In the end, I would never have thought that this would turn out to be one of the best pop records of the year--shows what I know.

0802130208|5.0|It is hard to say what is amazing in this book. Maybe it's the simple thing that is the world around us... There is so much humour in this book and yet underneath it a tregedy that cries so many tears... The hero, or better yet the worst hero type i have ever read in my life, making him the best antihero ever, is the strangest experience you will ever have the pleasure to read! Once you start this book u won't be able to put it down, but still this book is not for everyone interested in just a book. The writing in this book is amazing and as such should be appriciated. those who do not care for these things should do better by picking a diffrent book, even though i believe that this book is really by far the greatest writing piece i have ever read!!!
6304078145|5.0|After reading a pompous and preachy review following a 1 star rating, I had to throw in my 2 cents. For one, I dont believe in belittling another person based on their opinion. I loved this film. I have a great appreciation for anything that can be original in this age. Originality is getting harder and harder to achieve. The first room (story) is pretty cheesy, but it gets better with each room thereafter. The 2nd room is humourous. 3rd room even funnier. The 4th and final room is an insanely hilarious finale. Based on the first room, I was going to give this film 4 stars, but I couldnt bring myself to giving it less than 5. If you are into big budget box office (generic) movies, then this probably isnt the film for you. But if you have an appreciation for original thought and artistic brilliance, then you have to check this out. As for our small minded aforementioned reviewer, stick to your &quot;titanics&quot; and save your reviews for a genre that you understand.

0380002930|4.0|Watership Down is beautifully written, and well planned, but Richard Adams could have benefitted from some editing.  At times dry, it has enough action and pace in it to keep even the humblest readers satisfied.  An ideal book for teenagers, it has remarkable messages about beig the underdog and rising to the top.  Not perfectly expressed emotions, but Adams is very good at keeping what would otherwise be a boring book intriguing, twisted, and humorous.  A good read, and not too deep.  Good story line.  Timeless.

0192833588|4.0|Perhaps the negatives of Jane Austen is the dated quality of the words she used.  But, when one accompanies reading with a dictionary, she becomes a thoroughly charming author.  I read Jane Austen first in the 8th grade, and found it difficult to follow, and difficult to understand the humor.  After the 10th grade, a student gave a lecture on Irony and Seven Common Uses as Seen in Jane Austen's Three Most Famous Novels.  After hearing this, I came to a new appreciation.  Not light reading, it is the type of book that can be read over and over, and enjoyed more as the years go by.  I finished it for the fourth time three days ago, and still find myself dreaming, writing, and even speaking in the cautious and conscious turn of phrase that Jane Austen can so well suspend.  While not a book for a younger generation, it is definitely the kind of book that should and will be read.  Not, however, as sintilating as her future novels, and not as humorous as Emma or Pride and Prejudice.  A good starting point to get into reading British Literature.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I just want to point something out and prove a thoery of mine to everyone. People have said that this album didn't do well. Am I missing something here? It sold almost 5 million copies and it wasn't sucessful? Let me explain to you why this album sold as it did: It was a Britney Spears album. This album was so brilliant but let's look at the facts. This album yielded no major hits; Im a slave 4 U peaked at #27 on the Hot 100, Not a Girl didn't chart, Overprotected peaked at #86 and Boys failed to chart as well. But there's got to be something there right? Britney's name put on anything will sell. This album proves it. It was her best yet but imagine if it had a hit on it? That is exactly why it sold only half of her last album. Christina Aguilera had 3 top 20 hits on her new album Stripped yet it barely sold 3 million copies. Avril Lavigne had 3 top 10 hits on her album Let Go and it sold just over 5 million copies, The same as Britney's. Do you see? She is so incredibly popular that she took a risk by changing sound and still w/o any hits had a 5x platinum album. It appears the world was ready for the new Britney but I don't know about \\"Britney\\". Was the world ready for her, her music or neither. A multiplatinum ablum proves they were ready for Britney and In The Zone will be her test if the world is ready for her music. I am sure she's not going anywhere anytime soon but you have to wonder whether people really care about her music. I definately do but was the world ready for \\"Britney?\\" With 5 million sold you tell me.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Each time I listen to the entire CD I not only hear new sounds, but I'm taken to a new place, Amazing!!!!  I've seen Radiohead twice now and hearing this new album live was by far greater then I'd ever imagined. Keep it coming guys...I'll be waiting!
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci Code got off to a great start and made for a gripping read for the first hundred pages.  However, after that it became a little &quot;same old twist-ish&quot;.  After developing a wonderful plot around a very believable alternate history, it seems Brown got tired and just decided to quickly tie up some loose ends.  Without giving any names or giving away the ending, my major gripe is that, there was no explanation for why those characters who had been painted as potential &quot;behind the scenes&quot; masterminds were suddenly the good guys at the end.  The ending (all of twenty pages) seemed to be a &quot;let me just finish this book&quot;.  The entire story could have been condensed to half its current size in which case the ending may not have seemed like such an implausible soap opera.  After developing a whole host of characters in the first two hundred plus pages, he suddenly needs two new characters to finish off the story!  Quite disappointing for a book that could have been filled with intrigue.
6304539258|5.0|It's been over a quarter century since George Lucas (THX 1138, American Grafitti) first shared Star Wars with millions of awestruck moviegoers in the late spring of 1977.  Both the director and the studio executives at 20th Century Fox thought they'd have a modestly successful sci-fi/fantasy film with &quot;just okay&quot; box office receipts.  Instead, bucking their logic and lowered expectations, Star Wars became not only the biggest hit of its time, but it also launched both a multi-movie series and a huge merchandising/multimedia &quot;empire&quot; that made millions for the shy, unassuming USC film school graduate from Modesto, California.<br />Star Wars (later renamed Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) begins with one of the most stunning opening scenes in movie history: After the 20th Century Fox Fanfare and a moment of silence for the &quot;a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away&quot; card, the Star Wars logo appears with the opening chord of composer John Williams' now famous &quot;Main Theme&quot; -- which serves as accompaniment to a title crawl that sets the stage for a battle between good and evil.  &quot;It is a period of civil war,&quot; and Rebels have united to challenge the evil Galactic Empire.  From a hidden base in the Outer Rim, the Rebel fleet has won its first victory against Imperial forces.  In the heat of battle, Rebel agents have discovered the secret plans for the Death Star, a huge space station with a planet-killing superlaser.  Now those plans are in the hands of Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and her starship carries her back to her home world of Alderaan with a huge Imperial Star Destroyer in hot pursuit.<br />It is the very climax of this pursuit that starts Star Wars: A New Hope with that indelible first scene of a small Rebel blockade runner being pursued by the huge wedge shaped Star Destroyer.  The Blockade Runner is tractored into the Star Destroyer's ventral docking bay, and after a short and furious battle, Imperial troops led by Lord Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice by James Earl Jones) overrun the ship's defenses and capture Princess Leia.<br />But wait! Just as the battle is ending, C-3PO and R2-D2, a pair of droids who are a comedic pair along the lines of Laurel and Hardy, have evaded capture and left the captured Rebel ship aboard a small escape pod.  Below them lies the desert planet Tatooine, with its twin suns, small farming settlements, and two persons whose destiny was inextricably linked decades before.<br />The first of these two that the droids will encounter is young moisture farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a restless teenager who yearns for adventure and excitement beyond the confines of his Uncle Owen's (Phil Brown) struggling farm. With good mechanical skills (he modified his landspeeder on his own) and natural flying skills, Luke wants to follow his friend Biggs and enter the Imperial Space Academy.  But Owen and his wife Beru (the late Sheelagh Fraser) fear that Luke's dreams are much too dangerous, and Owen does everything possible to stall his nephew's ambitions. At first glance, one might think Owen is just a stubborn man, but when Beru points out that &quot;Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him,&quot; his earnest gaze and simple reply (&quot;That's what I'm afraid of.&quot;) hint at things yet to come.<br />The other person of great import to the struggle between Empire and Rebellion is Ben Kenobi  (Alec Guinness), an old hermit who lives beyond the Western Dune Sea.  Considered by the locals to be a &quot;crazy old wizard,&quot; he keeps to himself in a spartan hut carved into the face of a cliff. But looks can be deceiving, for as Luke discovers when &quot;Ben&quot; rescues him from a band of Tusken Raiders, Kenobi was once the legendary Jedi Knight and General Obi-Wan Kenobi.<br />When Obi-Wan hands him an old lightsaber, Luke also discovers that his father had not really been a navigator on a space freighter, buthad fought alongside Kenobi in the Clone Wars as a Jedi Knight.  &quot;A cunning warrior&quot; and &quot;the best starpilot in the galaxy,&quot; Skywalker the elder had been betrayed and murdered by a young former pupil of Obi-Wan's named Darth Vader.<br />After watching a holorecording of Princess Leia's plea for help, Kenobi then attempts to enlist Luke to take the droids to Alderaan with secret plans vital to the Rebellion, Luke hesitates. He wants to leave Tatooine, yes, but he feels an obligation to his aunt and uncle.<br />Alas, the long arm of the Empire has reached Owen and Beru first. Having tracked the robots to the jawas who had sold them to Luke's guardians, stormtroopers have slain the couple and orphaned Luke.  Now, fate -- or the Force -- has taken a hand, and Luke Skywalker vows that he  wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi.<br />Star Wars' second half, starting with the fateful meeting in the now famous Mos Eisley cantina with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and culminating with the climactic space battle over the Death Star, is a fast-paced chain of cliffhangers intended to be an homage to the cheesy-but-thrilling movie serials of the Thirties and Forties.  Will the Rebels get past the detention cell? Will the droids stop the trash compactor in time? Will Darth Vader face off against his former Master? Will Han Solo and Chewbacca go off to pay Jabba the Hutt, or will they save Luke during the last attack run down the Death Star trench?<br />Lucas' clever mix of various movie genres (Westerns, gangster films, sword-and-sorcery, and war movies), his pioneering advances in special effects, and John Williams' Academy Award-winning score are just a few reasons why movie audiences embraced Star Wars in such a manner that it became a part of American culture.  It's not perfect and it's hokey, yes, but it allowed many of us to forget (for two hours, anyway) all the troubles of the world.had fought alongside Kenobi in the Clone Wars as a Jedi Knight.  &quot;A cunning warrior&quot; and &quot;the best starpilot in the galaxy,&quot; Skywalker the elder had been betrayed and murdered by a young former pupil of Obi-Wan's named Darth Vader.  <br />After watching a holorecording of Princess Leia's plea for help, Kenobi then attempts to enlist Luke to take the droids to Alderaan with secret plans vital to the Rebellion, Luke hesitates.

B00000258J|5.0|This is not only a great sounding blues album - it's a great sounding album. Who doesn't know the testosterone-laden &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;? Who could listen to &quot;I Can't Be Satisfied&quot; and not be affected in some way? The rhythms and guitars pound like locomotives right into your helpless brain. Water's voice is strong as ever, and the band is as tight as the density of a neutron star. This has to be one of the best blues albums out there (though we can all have a good time trying to find out).
B00005JKC3|5.0|The story takes getting used to, but the special effects are great. The movie hulk is portrayed closer in character than the T. V. hulk ever was. A must have for any Hulk fan.
B00000E4OJ|5.0|I currently own three Schubert Symphony Cycles and this one by Istvan Kertesz and the Vienna Philharmonic is the best so far.  The stereo performances, beginning in 1963 with the 8th and 9th Symphonies and the Overtures, with the remainder done in 1970 and '71, are first rate and the value is unbeatable.  Compared to the other two Cycles I own, you get more music with the Kertesz than the Bohm in the form of three Overtures, and the performances are every bit its equal.  It is also a better overall value (and better performances!) than the Karajan (currently available as four mid-line single discs in EMI's \\"Karajan Edition\\" series, though the label would be wise to reissue those performances as a competing slim, paper-sleeved box set).  With that being said, my dad and I have yet to swap Schubert Symphony Cycles, so I cannot comment on accounts by Sawallisch, Menuhin or the new budget reissue by Sir Neville Marriner, which finishes the \\"Unfinished\\" and even completes a 10th Symphony.  Despite that, I can't imagine a more successful Schubert Symphony Cycle from start to finish than this one by Kertesz.
B00009TB5G|5.0|so many of you that leave these reviews take this stuff way too seriously. for god's sake just enjoy the fact that you were alive to see these movies made. to pick them apart like these people we all can't stand on TV (the critics) just shows how much free time you all need to fill with something else.
B00005JMFR|5.0|The Matrix revolutions (in my opinion) is the best movie I have seen in a while, one that I had been looking forward to beforehand as well.  Although some probably wouldn't agree, I thought the end of this trilogy brought a somewhat satisfying closure to the story. It shows you the war Morpheus had been referring to and foreshadowing since waaaay back in the first movie, Morpheus described how devasting the war was becoming and now you have a chance to see just how intense and overwhelming it really is.  I give the action scenes an A+.  <br />Although I'm not much for love stories, I know a good one when it comes along and the latter scenes focusing on Neo and Trinity is extremely heart-felt, very well done.  Everybody has their own theories on what the Matrix \\"means\\" and what it is implying POSSIBLY about our world, frankly I don't know WHAT it was trying to tell us.....but what I got out of the movie is that it had a lot to deal with fighting for what you deeply believe in at all costs, making unselfish sacrifices at the most opportune moment, and dying for your loved one/s without thinking twice.  Love, sacrifice and war are all timeless ideas that every human being can instinctively relate to, so who's to say this movie is a waste?, even if you are one who didn't discover the movie ending you had expected.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites, and I'm usually into movies like The Matrix, Blackhawk Down, etc... but Finding Nemo found its way into my library of good DVDs.<br />However, don't let its cute appearance fool you. It's not REALLY for young kids. Some of the jokes go over their heads while some of the animations could cause the kids to have nightmares. There's a scene where Dory and Marlin first meet Bruce the shark. His looming presence made me jump a little in my seat.<br />Then there's the deep sea fish w/ the bioluminiscent light...<br />For parents or older siblings, I highly recommend you watch this movie FIRST before showing it to younger children - simply cover their eyes when the &quot;scary&quot; scenes occur. Other than a few scenes, the whole movie is a blast to watch.
B00005JLR2|4.0|I don't usually submit reviews, but after reading a lot of the ones here I couldn't help myself.  Treasure Planet is a great little movie for kids.  As with most Disney movies of late, it is not aimed at a preschooler crowd -- some younger kids may be o.k. with it, but parents should be prepared to watch it with them (some scary characters, lots of shot-'em-up action and swashbuckling, etc.).  Bottom line -- my kids liked it, and so did I.  It deals with a title character who has some problems; his dad abandoned the family, and he's trying to deal with his anger and prove himself.  It also deals with friendship, good vs. evil, and all the usual &quot;Disney formula for an animated film&quot; stuff.  <br />It drives me crazy when so many reviews talk about the lack of plot line and character development...Hello!!!  This is a KIDS movie!  Kids like simple plot lines, characters that are clearly good or evil, and lots of repetition!  If you're looking for depth, an animated film made for kids may not be your best bet. :o)  True, some parts of the movie are annoying beyond belief (one word -- Morph), but reading three Dr. Suess books in a row drives me bonkers, and those are considered children's classics.  <br />Bottom line, this movie is not a life changing experience, and not in the same category as the Pixar films like &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and &quot;Toy Story.&quot; There are better disney films out there.  BUT, it's still a good way to pass a rainy afternoon with the kids.
B000002HRE|5.0|Contrary to what Metallica detractors preach, Reload is a great record.  With portions of it recorded during the same sessions that yield Load, Reload sound is in that same style but different at the same time.<br />The first thing you notice when Fuel begins is the production sound.  Only a year appart and Reload's production and sound is much better than Load's.  Second thing you notice is how good Fuel is!!! This song rocks with such gusto, it's definitely one of my favorties on this cd.  Where the Wild Things Are is another one of the songs that's among Metallica's best over.  The vocal effects are unlike anything the boys have done in the past and the theme revisits that of Disposable Heroes.  The epic Fixxxer is just amazing, great lyrics and music.<br />Unless you've been living under a rock, you've probably listened to The Memory Remains and The Unforgiven II, and know how good these songs are.  Other personal favorites are Devil's Dance, Carpe Diem Baby, and Bad Seed.  <br />Don't listen to the trash-talking Metallica haters who've probably haven't even listened to the entire cd but still bad-mouth it.  Give it a listen and you won't be dissapointed.  Kick-... cd.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I would just like to start off by saying that downloading a few tracks off of Kazaa, Win MX, Limewire, etc. will not do this album justice. If you are a fan of Maynard's, go out and BUY this. The reason you need this entire recording is it is very atmospheric. If you are like me, you were disappointed in Mer De Noms because it had a few good songs but seemed slapped together. It's obvious that more thought was put into this album after the first song. it is much more mature and mellow than their debut was, and I didn't find my self skipping more than half the tracks, setting it to &quot;repeat one&quot;. Paz and Troy have been replaced by James Iha-Of Smashing Pumpkins fame-and Jeordie White. I can't wait for APC's next release to see what direction they take it in, although I'm not sure if Maynard will return to Tool for another album, or stay with APC for another, than return to Tool. Either way, his bands will continue to amaze. One option is that APC go on without Maynard for an album, but that would be a perfect example of shooting one's self in the foot, and there is only a .0001 percent chance of anything that stupid ever happening. <BR>Bottom Line: Buy this, it's well worth the money, unless you were a huge fan of Mer De Noms, in which case, you'll probably hate it.
B00000IQC8|5.0|The film goes back and forth between a \\"regular\\" working day, and the personal lives of Randal (Jeff Anderson) and Dante (Brian O'Halloran). Dante works in a convienient store. He is a whiny, goody two shoes, that puts up with all of the customer's crap. The day before, he had to work an open to close shift. The boss called him on his day off, and promised that he would be in at 12:00 noon to take over. He stands Dante up, making him work back to back open-to-close shifts. \\"But I'm not even supposed to be here today!\\" Next you have Randal. Randal works next door at the video store. Randal goes out of his way to upset customers and does what he wants, when he wants. Everything from spitting water in their faces, to watching pornography in the store. Randal and Dante make the perfect pair. They are so different, but make you laugh the same. \\"Clerks\\" also marks the first time appearance of the two lazy drug dealers named Jay ( Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob ( Kevin Smith). They either stand around outside and sell, or come in and make Dante and Randall miserable. Thrown into the mix are the two most important women in Dante's life. There is his ex girlfriend Katlin (Lisa Spoonhauer)who cheated on Dante nine times, and is getting married. Despite all the bad treatment, Dante still wants her. Then there is his present girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti). She loves Dante dearly, and is the best choice. But she unfortunately has a long lost of ex boyfriends, that has caused her to have a high number \\"sexual favors\\". \\"I'm number 37?!!\\" <br />Most of the time, people save the best for last. But in this case, Clerks was Kevin Smith's first and best film. In fact, the film almost did not get made. Smith sold his comic book collection for $27,000 to make it happen. That makes \\" Clerks\\" one of the most profitable films ever made. The story is one that anyone can relate to. It is every person's dream to be able to tell the customers what you think of them, and do anything thatyou want when you are working. This is the reason why the film is so funny. It offers a no holds barred look at perfecting the art of ignoring the rule \\"the customer is always right\\". Jeff Anderson summed up the idea behind the film perfectly when he said \\"This job would be great, if it weren't for the customers\\". The film is shot brilliantly because it is in black and white to give the appearance of watching through a security camera. The entire cast did an outstanding job in this film, despite the fact that they were all relatively all unknown.<br />\\"Clerks\\" is an unforgettable film. The cast is incredible, and the story couldn't be better. The Collector's Series DVD is amazing. Kevin Smith likes to offer the best possible extras. You get commentary from Kevin Smith as well as the cast, deleted scenes, and a hillarious alternate ending. This DVD is a must own, that you can watch over and over again!
0316666343|4.0|There is only one word to describe this book, that word is amazing. This book is unlike any other book I have ever read. Alice Sebold is great author and did a wonderful job writing The Lovely Bones.<BR>     Susie Salmon is a fourteen-year-old girl who was raped and murdered by a strange guy in her neighborhood.  From that day on Susie watches over her friends and family from what she calls `her heaven'.  She watches her family as they struggle through a miraculous journey while trying to cope with her death.  She watches her crush and first kiss, Ray Singh, as he tries to move on.  She also watches a girl named Ruth, whom she never talked to on Earth but gained a special connection with after her death.  Though none of them knew it, Susie was with them when they needed her most. <BR>     By reading the `blurb' in the book you get the impression that it is a sad and almost depressing book.  Yet, after reading it I can truly say that it is anything but.  This is a heartwarming and sometimes funny story that makes you think about life and your own family.  It is an absolute page-turner from the very beginning.  I recommend The Lovely Bones to anyone and everyone in search of a good book to escape in.

B0000048V8|5.0|My husband and I first saw this video on public television about 15 years ago and thought it was fabulous, and anxiously waited for it to play during the Christmas season.  When our daughter was born, it was finally available on VHS and she would sit mesmerized watching the color and and listening to the music throughout the movie.  She wouldn't move as she sat in my lap and watched.  There is not one little thing that is violent or scary -- just wonderful! It is a very special movie to share with your family!

He can't rhyme or tell a story. anyone who thinks he's good is either 5 years old or dosen't know what real rap is. he's been around for years. where have you people been. eminem could have picked anyone and you idiots would like whoever it was. If eminem said the moon was made of cheese most of you people would probably believe him. this album is a joke.
B00005N5S5|4.0|While lacking the superior effects and epic preachy scope of its successors, the original film serves as a taut and gritty introduction to the Terminator mythos of James Cameron.  Sent back in time by the machine world god to eliminate the mother of the leader of the human resistance, played by the creased and unattractively mannish Linda Hamilton, Arnold is the Terminator T-101, a killing machine wrapped in human flesh.  To stop him, the human resistance of the future sends a lone soldier back to ostensibly save Hamilton but also to fulfill is uh other duties.  Shot mostly at night, there is never much of a let down in the action as the Terminator stalks and shoots at the two protagonists.  The stop motion animation of the T-101, and the miniatures of the opening and dream sequences, well before the advent of affordable CG, doesn't hold up too well these days.  Also in the post-Conan era, Arnold brings a blank relentlessness to the Terminator that would do Michael Meyers proud.  Unlike the two sequels, the film is widely humorless, except for, amusingly enough, Lance Henriksen as the cynical cop.  While rightfully a genre stand-out, it does appear a bit dated.  The 2 sided DVD offers some rather old documentaries on the making of T1 w/ Cameron and Arnold vying for conversation control.  There's also the original treatment, and Cameron's artwork.  Not bad and still recommended.
B00006690G|2.0|This is just proof that eminem could put crap on a cd and 10,000 idiots will waste there money on it. If you think this is anywhere near as good as his first 2 albums then you obviously have a drinking problem
B000089RVX|1.0|It's quite fitting that one of the definitions for the word &quot;evanescence&quot; is &quot;n : the property of lasting for a very short time.&quot;  Dear Lord, we can only hope.<br />Just another group of white, middle-class kids wearing black and wining.  Let's look for a new gimmick people, please. <br />Don't buy it.  I'm glad I didn't having heard a copy belonging to me friend.  Ewwwww!  BAD CD ALERT!
B00000I2UC|2.0|Compared to all other J&amp;MC albums, this one stands out as the most banal and 2-dimensional. <br />This album was produced by suits. End of story.<br />There is no question that a reasonable album was cut in the studio and a bunch of remix jockeys massaged it into something that pandered to the lowest common denominator. Psychocandy had none of that and was a large commerical success - why the label decided that could not be replicated, I could not tell you. <br />Muscially there are some very interesting elements in this work, but they have had all the rough edges sanded down. If you are looking for J&amp;MC albums that are creative and push the edges of music, listen to Psychocandy and Munki.<br />While I *do* enjoy listening to this album, keep in mind it is J&amp;MC work in an &quot;Elevator Music&quot; warpper. <br />Annoying and dissappointing.
B00003CX8T|5.0|Although the standards of Disney animation will constantly be evolving with virtually every movie they make,there are some that will always remain popular - Pinocchio and Dumbo spring to mind. I'm not sure if Aladdin is generally viewed as a classic but it certainly is in my eyes. I love the whole idea of this movie - big, spectacular Persian palaces, magic carpets, treasure troves... The soundtrack, although not as moving as that of The Lion King is still very good and very suited to the film. <br />I can't believe it's taking Disney so long to release Aladdin on DVD either. Here in the UK they released a special edition of Beauty and the Beast about a year ago and now they have jumped to releasing the Lion King. I'd be interested to know why Aladdin wasn't released on DVD before the Lion King as it was made first. I rang a number on the back of a Disney DVD and spoke to someone who told me that Aladdin should be released in the UK about October 2004. I sincerely hope it's earlier than that!
0385504209|2.0|I had my doubts about this book, but I enjoyed it.  I'm grateful that I got it from the library rather than paying a ridiculous hardcover price for it.  It's entertaining, but certainly not worth the money.<br />&quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is a quick read.  The writing is not at all challenging, which makes it a good bedside book.  The characters each have their interesting qualities, although none is fully developed.<br />My two biggest disappointments with this book were the tricks used to throw the reader off from guessing who the bad guy is,  (apparently this is common in mysteries -- I don't generally read them so I was peeved,)  and the failure of some of the more historically interesting passages to deliver in any way that transcends the book.  Each piece of information works within the story, though, which I suppose is all any reader ought to expect.<br />It's an entertaining book, but I really can't comprehend the excitement around it.  It's got average writing and average storytelling.  The subject -- the possibility of a secret society protecting actual descendants of Jesus Christ -- is stimulating, but ultimately not very well explored.<br />For those of you still on the fence, get it from the library or wait for the mass-market paperback edition.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|The word going around on the AC/DC forum at Elektra when this first hit the market was that some of the tracks on this DVD had been over dubbed. Meaning that its not the original sound found on the VHS version! And no one knows why as of yet? But that dosent stop this show from beeing worth buying, only the hardcore AC/DC fan will notcie a few slight changes! Its nothing to worry about, the sound is absolutly fantastic!<br />AC/DC's greatest show is now on DVD. Which is great because I, like many others had the shoddy VHS version that Angus's guitar was not hearable, so I never even knew what the original solos sounded like, the only thing i could tell a diffrence on was TNT it seemed to have been more the \\"oi oi oi\\" of the LIVE SE albums chant on TNT ...but again, its nothing to worry about!<br />The extras are a few alternate camera angles! but there a bonus feature, there not one of those ones where you can press your remotes \\"camera angle\\" feature, there seprate all together! Theres not one for every song, or is there any two angles for the same song! Most of them are Angus and Brian, one or two for Cliff and Malcolm, and i'm not even sure if Chris Slade got one or not? There is a short Audio Commentry with Angus and Malcolm and they give you some info about some intresting things! And there is a discography of pretty much all the world released AC/DC albums, with Angus and Malcolm putting some Audio Commentry over the top of them if youd like some info about those albums!!!!<br />apart from the new dubbing. This DVD isgreat, and will be the video to make all you non AC/DC fans eyes pop open and hear a sound unlike no other! and the enormous crowd headbanging along to the worlds greatest Rock N Roll band thats sure to make you see this band in a whole new light if you know nothing of the worlds most electrifieing band. This DVD is no disapoinment, and features more footage then released on the VHS! for egsample, the VHS did not come with \\"High Voltage\\" and tho its seen as to why it was cut because of some malfunctions with Angus's guitar, its there now for you to enjoy!
B00005JM02|5.0|I've been a fan of Disney/Pixar movies since Toy Story, A Bug's Life, ect. When I saw the previews for Finding Nemo, I couldn't wait to see it. I finally saw it in the movies with my dad and my best friend, and I LOVED it! The computer animation and colors were beautiful! The voices were perfect, and the story was cute. The movie starts out with a young clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) with his wife Coral who are parents-to-be. Suddenly, a baracuda attacks, and eats Coral and the rest of the eggs except for one: Nemo. Marlin takes care of Nemo on his own, and is very protective of his son. But soon, Nemo is kidnapped by divers! Marlin desperetly tries to find Nemo with the help of his new friend, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has short term memory loss, and the adventure begins... <BR>~~~~~~<BR>Will Marlin and Dory find Nemo? Buy this movie and find out! :)

So far I enjoy to read this interesting story so much .Also , I have made a self-questioning that is how many books have I read before.<BR>   Speaking of Matilda, she is a intelligent girl and has quick-learning ability.She absorts knowledge by reading books and starts to know her family members have many wrong thinking and behaving .She starts her school life and occurs in much experience.<BR>    I'd like to continue reading Matilda and found more interesting from it.
B00008MNYS|4.0|The US version has most of the same songs, but its missing the great songs \\"Hot Fudge\\" (the best RW song yet), \\"Song 3\\" and \\"Cursed\\". But here you get \\"Get A Little High\\", \\"How Peculiar Reprise\\" and \\"One Fine Day\\". Its better to get the import because you get Get A Little High and One Fine Day on the Come Undone and Sexed Up import singles. Still, the US version is Robbie, so its great too.
0141301066|4.0|I think people should read the book Matilda by Roald Dahl because you can get hooked because of the author's creativity.<br />A good thing about the book is that it is very detailed. When Matilda meets the Trunchbull it is easy to visualise what the character looks like.I image Trunchbull always wears a brown cotton smock with a leather belt with a silver buckle. I can really see her ugly bottle-green stockings with turn-up tops and flat-heeled brogues with leather flaps. <BR>The book also gets interesting at some parts. It is great when the secret about Truchbull is revealed.<BR>I recommend this book for people who like fiction and \\"English\\" rather than \\"American\\" words and writing style.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|This sounds like a great album. Certainly a relief from the &quot;rap&quot; influenced music nowadays. The music is raw and straight rock. Maybe..just maybe bands like the strokes will give rock n roll another chance to thrive...
B00005JMFO|5.0|This was an excellent movie. I loved it! My mom went with me and didn't like how there were so many different stories going around but I thought that was what kept you interested in the movie. I highly reccomend seeing it.
B000092ZYX|1.0|I know the Radiohead fans will buy this CD just to have it for their `collection', regardless of how bad the CD actually is. However, if you're not collecting Radiohead CD's, then don't buy it. There is no other way to describe it without using the words `painful' and `awful', especially the track to which I only refer to as the `clapping song'. That one made me want to start bashing my head against the wall in hope that I would pass out and no longer have to listen to that terrible noise coming from my CD player.<br />Luckily, I didn't buy a copy, so I don't feel like I have wasted my money. However, I was forced to listen to it. I now have an urge to start scratching the CD with a sharp object whenever I see it for the trauma it caused me.<br />If you want to hear it for yourself, then just download some of the songs off the internet, or borrow it from someone. Don't buy it based on the assumption that its good because its Radiohead
B000089RVX|5.0|I was going on a trip to California and I bought this cd after only hearing &quot;Bring Me To Life.&quot; While on the plane I decided to listen to the whole cd, and was AMAZED. I am one to always read lyrics because I love it when lyrics relate to my life, and Evanescence's did like none other before. Every song is soothing with just a little bit of an edge to keep you alive. Amy Lee's voice is so amazing because it is impossible to match. Seriously. Try it. She gives you the screaming without the scratching growling. You must get this cd. You won't be disappointed.<br />Best song: Hello
B00008J4P5|3.0|I really like the singles from this album, and so I decided to download some of the other songs. As it turns out, I don't like them at all.<br />I suggest to anyone that is hearing the White Stripes for the first time, to go and do the same. If you like the other songs on the album then go buy it. <br />If you buy the CD because you have heard the singles and you've liked them, I cannot guarantee that you will be at all happy with owning this CD.
B00008H2LB|3.0|With their release of a third album, Linkin Park fanatics would surely debate, &quot;Which one of their albums is the best?&quot;<br />Meteora isn't on my list.  It is a pleasant C.D., but I perfer Hybrid Theory and Reanimation over it.  After listening so many Linkin Park songs, you'd probably get my point.  Their rap-metal style is the same, but I think it's gettting redundant; that's why I stick with the first two albums.  The album is relatively short.<br />New lyrics and tunes are great, but I'm not surprised by it.  It's not a &quot;must-have&quot;, but nevertheless, it is an enjoyable C.D.  to listen to... for a couple of times.
0688163173|5.0|What an excellent read this was.  I had almost given up on Lehane after Mystic River, which I found HORRID.  But, with Shutter Island, he proves just how wonderful a writer he is.<br />The end is an absolute GAS!!  You will definitely feel duped.<br />Hey, Dennis, are you EVER going to bring back Kenzie and Gennaro?  I'm still wondering what happened to Bubba. . .and, although Shutter Island is pretty close to a modern masterpiece, I do miss the fun of the Kenzie/Gennaro series.<br />Man, this guy can write.
B00006RIO7|4.0|Having never seen the original Broadway musical, I can't comment on how the movie stacks up to the stage version, but I enjoyed the movie a great deal.  Although you really have to see the movie itself to appreciate the music on the soundtrack album, the music is terrific!  The real show-stealers are Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma and Queen Latifah as Mama Morton.  Catherine's got impressive vocal chops - particularly on the scorching-hot album opener, &quot;And All That Jazz&quot; - and if you've seen the movie, you know she's a terrific dancer too.  She definitely seems in her element, having performed on the stage in London before.  And as for Queen Latifah... I knew she could rap, but I didn't know she could sing like that!  &quot;When You're Good To Mama&quot; is a showstopper, both aurally and visually.  I wish she had more than one solo!  Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger's vocal abilities didn't impress me quite as much, but I think their singing fit their roles very well, and Renee actually can sing better than, say, Jennifer Lopez.  Renee did a great job of capturing the &quot;ditziness&quot; of Roxie Hart.  (&quot;Funny Honey&quot; is hilarious, especially when Roxie realizes her husband is ratting on her and the tone of the song changes...) For me, Richard Gere's real shining moment in the film is one that wasn't captured on the soundtrack CD, because it isn't a song: his tap solo during Roxie's trial.  My absolute favorite track on this CD - and my absolute favorite song from the movie - is the &quot;Cell Block Tango,&quot; with the Six Merry Murderesses' sordid tales of how they killed their lovers that manage to be provocative and amusing at the same time.  &quot;I fixed him his drink as usual... You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic!&quot; (Haven't listened to the hip-hop version of &quot;CBT&quot; or the Anastacia track, so I can't comment on those, but I'm not really a hip-hop fan so I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like those cuts.) The one song I really don't like on this CD is &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot; (good vocal performance, but I hate the song... it's too depressing).  Also, &quot;I Can't Do It Alone&quot; loses something in the translation to CD, because you can't see the dance moves that Catherine (as Velma) is performing.  Overall: Again, you have to see the movie to appreciate the music, but with a few exceptions, the music holds up very well on its own.  After this, I would love to see the show on stage, preferably on Broadway.  4.5 stars.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones: A Novel<BR>     Do you want to read a book that keeps you wondering what is going to happen from beginning to end?  The Lovely Bones: A Novel by Alice Sebold is the book to read.  This book is full of suspense and keeps it's audiences wanting to read more.  Alice Sebold is a wonderful author who wrote a book of fiction, but focuses on events that really happen in everyday life.  <BR>     The way that Alice Sebold wrote this book connects well with the title.  This book is about a fourteen-year-old girl that was raped and gruesomely murdered by her neighbor.  Suzie, the fourteen-year-old girl, tells the story from heaven.  This book focuses on what heaven was like from Suzie's point of view, and the events she saw taking place on earth while she was in heaven.  Suzie struggles being in heaven, and not being able to help her family find whom the murderer is.<BR>     Alice Sebold uses wonderful detail and great description in this book.  This book is well organized and wonderfully wrote.  This book is intended for a teenage to adult audience.  Alice Sebold compares and contrasts the things that Suzie sees on earth.  Alice Sebold tells how Suzie would figure them out and how her relatives do on earth.  <BR>     I didn't find any weaknesses in this book.  I thought it was very well written.  Some of the strengths in this book are the way Alice Sebold had Suzie give her description of heaven from a teenage point of view, the way she wrote about events that families go through in every day life, and how Suzie's family coped with her death.  <BR>     The Lovely Bones: A Novel shouldn't be read by a younger audience because of the graphic details.  I think that the content was very suitable for teen to adult ages.  I think the contents in this book give its audiences an awareness of things that could happen, and does happen to the ones we love.  <BR>     I liked The Lovely Bones: A Novel because it held my interest from the beginning to the end.  This bookmade me wonder what heaven is really like, and what I would do if something like that happened to someone I know.  I enjoyed this book also because the author made her points in the book very easy to comprehend, and easy to follow.  <BR>     If you are looking for a book to hold your interest, and keep wondering what is going to happen next, The Lovely Bones: A Novel by Alice Sebold is it.  You won't be sorry you took the time to read it.
B00005JKOI|4.0|Pretty in Pink deals with teen and social problems at their worst.  It shows that no matter how far you've come there is always somebody somewhere who will not like or accept you.  <br />Pretty in Pink is watchable and fairly entertaining. It doesn't have the cool scenery and hot dialogue as St. Elmo's Fire.  It's not nearly as funny or fast paced as Sixteen Candles and it comes nowhere close to being as incredibly fabulous as The Breakfast Club ( which is the best Brat Pack film hands down!).<br />Put Pretty in Pink deals with a teen's look at how being poor can damage your love life and your reputation.<br />Molly Ringwald is Andie.  The red-head 80's teen queen Ringwald plays Andie similar to the role of Sam in Sixteen Candles.  Andie lives with her father who hasn't been able to deal with the fact that his wife/Andie's mother left them with no explanation.  Andie is a teen with a lot on her shoulders. She goes to school, works, studies and takes care of her father.  Without her friend Duckie she wouldn't have made it through the harder moments in life. He keeps her laughing when everyone else is laughing at her. Duckie ( Jon Cryer ) is head over heels in love with Andie. The audience can't sense that Andie knows this.  When Duckie starts the lovey duvey talk Andie always brushes it off as another one of jokes. It's not until Blane ( Andrew McCarthy ) steps in the picture that Duckie gets the nerve to tell her how he really feels. Duckie reluctantly steps aside to let Blane and Andie embark on a stressed relationship. While Andie believes the relationship is hardest for her to deal with because Blane is rich and part of the in-crowd, she has no idea how hard it is for him to be with her. It turns out that Blane's snotty friends are giving him a hard time. James Spader is Steff ( probably in one of his most memorable roles ).  Steff is the richest and the cruelist kid in the entire school. He's Blane's nasty best friend who tries to persuade Blane to stay away from Andie.  On the other hand Steff has a secret motive.  He doesn't resent Blane and Andie's relationship because of their social differences, but because he has been in love with Andie and can't take no for an answer. After constantly bullying her to date him and getting nowhere, Steff pulls out all the stops to make Blane give up on his true love.  <br />This film is described as a &quot; Cinderella &quot; type but I thought it was more on the lines of &quot; Sleeping Beauty &quot;. It is indeed a modern fairytale.  This film was made seventeen years ago ( when I was eight ) and I never paid it much attention although I'm a brat pack fan to the end.  This is not the best brat pack movie in the world but is and will always be a classic to us 80's kids. Once again Molly Ringwald was on top of the world.
0393317552|3.0|Jared Diamond is a thoroughgoing geographical determinist. His book highlights both the strengths and the weaknesses of this approach.<br />Diamond's major topic is the Neolithic Revolution. His intention is to demonstrate that environmental conditions were not equally suitable to the development of agriculture on different continents. Eurasia, he contends, was the most appropriate place. It had the largest number of domesticable plants and animals, an east-west axis favoring the diffusion of inventions, offered good possibilities for inter-continental communication, and was the largest and most populous continent. So the Eurasians were first in developing agriculture, gaining thus a headstart in history. Agriculture led to rising polulations and created a dynamic that prompted the evolution of states, writing and a sophisticated technology (guns and steel). These social and technological advantages, plus immunity to the most dangerous infectious diseases (germs), allowed Eurasians to easily subdue the natives of the Americas, Australia and Southeast Asia.<br />On the whole this argument, which takes up the first 410 pages of the book, is convincing. Diamond is also right to insist on adopting a long time-frame. As early as 8000 years ago Eurasians had a substantial edge over their rivals on other continents, making it unlikely for those peoples and civilizations to catch up.<br />Had Diamond stopped writing at this point, he would have published a good work.<br />However, he was not content to treat only the Neolithic Revolution, but wanted to cover all major turns in world history. Hence the last 15 (!) pages of the book are devoted to a completely different subject. Having explained the rise of Eurasia, Diamond now wants to explain the rise of the West. Quickly the question becomes: Why Europe, not China? Borrowing an idea from Eric Jones ('The European Miracle'; but beware: Jones' approach is much more sophisticated than Diamond's, avoiding any kind of monocausal determinism) Diamond provides a simple answer: Europe was geographically more diverse than China. Therefore it did not become politically unified. Political fragmentation led to openness and openness to progress - ideas and inventions that were rejected at one place could succeed at another.<br />This speculation is not plausible at all.  <br />First, there is no geographical NECESSITY for European fragmentation and Chinese unity. Europe has many features favoring political unity. Its long coastline and a great number of navigable rivers allow for easy transportation by water, offering an important asset to any would-be imperial power. The Romans took advantage of this to the utmost, and if they were able to conquer a great part of the continent, there can surely have been no compelling GEOGRAPHICAL reason for later powers to fail. Diamond himself seems to realize this, when he admits that India had even more agricultural core areas than Europe. Yet India was ruled as a unified empire for most of its history.<br />Second, Diamond's explanation - even if assumed to be correct - accounts only for INNOVATION. It tells us why certain inventions made by Chinese craftsmen were never introduced into the production-process of China's economy. A more important question to ask would have been why many significant inventions were not made in China in the first place. A prime example coming to mind is modern natural science, which was never developed in the Middle Kingdom.<br />Third, it is easy to see that Diamond's argument is undermined by his own evidence. As he tells us, China was scientifically and technologically ahead of Europe (and the rest of the world) for more than 1000 years. If China could achieve this superiority despite its supposed geographical disadvantages, we cannot escape the conclusion that those disadvantages either did not exist or were of minor importance. Europe, on the other hand, remained a cultural backwater for most of its history despite its supposed geographical advantages. Again, we cannot but conclude that these advantages either did not exist or were of minor importance.<br />Thus Diamond's environmentalism is completely refuted by Chinese and European history before 1500 a.d. Moreover, no other version of geographical determinism is likely to fare better. Since China's geography did not change within the last 2000 years, every purely geographical interpretation of its history must be wrong. It will either fail to account for the period of Chinese superiority or for the period of Chinese backwardness.<br />Diamond's errors are grounded in his method. Geographical determinism can explain the Neolitic Revolution, because this transformation was brought about by small bands of hunter-gatherers extremely dependant on their environment. Even so, Diamond needs FOUR causal factors to account for its different outcome on each continent (1. The wild plant and animal species available; 2. Orientation of the major continental axis; 3. Possibilities for inter-continental communication, 4. Size of area and population of a given continent). When we look at the great Eurasian civilizations, we have to deal with a type of society vastly more complex and far less dependant on its environment than are bands of hunter-gatherers. Yet Diamond wants to explain the history of these civilizations with reference to just ONE causal factor (the impact of geography on political unity). Instead of becoming more sophisticated in accordance with its subject, Diamond's approach turns brutally simplistic just as it is applied to the most difficult problem of world history.<br />It is unlikely that the rise of the West can ever be explained geographically. Any serious attempt to write global history for periods after the Neolithic Revolution will have to be sensitive to the complex interplay between geography, economy, technology, politics and culture that shapes the development of large societies. The work of Max Weber and Fernand Braudel provides good examples of the kind of scholarship needed for this task. Jared Diamond's book not only fails to rise up to this standard, but is crude, superficial and disappointing even from a geographical point of view.<br />Clearly Diamond did not know when to put his pen down. His book would have been better if he had refrained from addressing topics unsuited to his method.
B000003TAR|5.0|As someone who became a fan of Nirvana upon listening to &quot;Nevermind,&quot; I can attest to the fact that &quot;In Utero&quot; is a bit unsettling at first. The first time I put it on in the car, I nearly took it out. But then, I gave it a few more tries, and it is now my all-time favorite CD. It shows all of Nirvana at their best, and listening to it even ten years later, it is almost unbearable to know that this band will never be together again in the studio. <br />I'd like to put in a special note about &quot;All Apologies,&quot; the final track on the album and my favorite song of all time -- it is the most beautiful song, starting out slowly and then building a little, then ending with the softening refrain of &quot;All in all is all we are.&quot; When you finish listening to it, you feel as though you've just listened to Kurt Cobain's final words. And that, in itself, makes this triumphant album worth buying.
B0000C8AUO|3.0|I loved Bowie's HOURS and HEATHEN so I was anxiously awaiting REALITY.  My first listen didn't go well.  I didn't care for the disc at all, but decided I'd give it more time to grow on me.  And it has, but not by much.  I enjoyed the melancholy tracks &quot;The Lonliest Guy&quot; and &quot;Bring Me The Disco King&quot; the best, but none of the upbeat songs stayed with me.  I'd list this as his weakest effort in awhile.  Still, it's more interesting than most performers these days.<br />As for the bonus disc, the remake of &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot; is the best, but I prefer teh original and don't see why the remake was necessary.  I would have rather heard a completely new track.  &quot;Fly&quot; and &quot;Queen Of All The Tarts&quot; follow the mold of the main album and are not that memorable.  I suggest buying the regular version of the album if you're not a Bowie completist.
B000003TA4|4.0|I wouldn't say &quot;Nevermind&quot; is overrated, because it did revolutionize music, but the thing is, &quot;In Utero&quot; is a better album. However, &quot;Nevermind&quot; is great in its own right, and it was an excellent sophomore effort for the band that I believe to be the best of all time.<br />The album opens with the great &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; which may be the greatest way to open an album ever. You hear Kurt scream the final words and the guitars fade out, and you think &quot;Wow -- there's another forty minutes of this coming?&quot; And it absolutely psyches you up for the rest of the album.<br />The rest of the album is very good. It contains the great songs &quot;In Bloom,&quot; &quot;Come As You Are,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; and &quot;Polly.&quot; However, it also has its somewhat mediocre songs, such as &quot;Lounge Act&quot; and &quot;Stay Away,&quot; which fit in fine with the album but individually are not excellent at the level which some Nirvana songs are.<br />Basically, I recommend this CD for anyone who has an appreciation for excellent drums, amazing lyrics, and powerful bass. If you have never listened to Nirvana, this is where you should start, so that you have an understanding of what most people consider to be their greatest album.
B0000DD79B|4.0|This is my first Simon &amp; Garfunkel CD though I am somewhat familiar with their music.  I've been enjoying this set for a few weeks now.  My only complaint are the 8 live tracks included.  I hate it when live tracks are included in a greatest hits collection.  I'd much prefer the original versions.  Aside from that minor complain, I'd highly recommend this set.  i think it's their only 2 disc greatest hits set.  That alone makes it a great purchase for new fans like me.<br />As a bonus the booklet includes original recording and release dates, states the album the track is from and the tracks Billboard ranking.
B000002C1W|5.0|&quot;By the way, which one is Pink?&quot; is a lyric line from Pink Floyd's follow up album to &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot;<br />Let me tell you Pink Floyd fans my opinion: Pink's real name is David Gilmour.<br /> &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; has replaced &quot;The Final Cut&quot; as what I personally believe to be Pink Floyd's greatest work. My opinion is only my opinion, and I invite other music lovers to buy all 25 or so works of this fantastic group and then decide for themselves.<br />Yes, buy this CD. <br />But first, go to amazon.com and buy the DVD of &quot;David Gilmour in Concert&quot;. Yes, there are NO helium-filled flying pigs or spectacular pyrotechnics or crumbling walls, but if you want to see exactly who is the &quot;meat-and-potatoes&quot; guy of this band , and you happen to like really good music, this is the DVD that you are certain to love and that will drive you back to the web to buy &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; on CD.<br />By the way, which one is Pink? What an easy question to answer.<br /> David Gilmour, with help from original band members Nick Mason and Richard Wright.  What a pity I can only give this wonderous CD five stars.<br />Come on, boys and girls, NOBODY does this level of excellence alone. Pink Floyd is a group, not a single person. It has survived and brought joy to millions, both when Syd Barrett had to leave and when Roger Waters had to leave.  This ship sails on, but not without me aboard!
B00005ATQD|1.0|perfect title wrong movie. i fell asleep fifteen minutes into the movie. it's that boring.
B0000029GA|5.0|I bought &quot;It was written&quot; and thought it was great so i bought Illmatic expecting it not to be very good as debuts usually aren't. Although there's only 9 tracks it's still good value. Anyone who likes raw hip hop will love this album every track has got a perfect bassy backbeat and then on top of that there's Nas' MCing (he's the best rapper in the world). My favourite tracks are NY state of mind, Halftime, Memory Lane, One time for your mind and Represent. This is classic hip hop and the best Cd ever. Buy it if you like real hip hop none of that RnB s**t!!!!!!
B00005JKC3|1.0|it isn't a good movie by any sense. i pity yall who like it and say it's s good movie.
B00005JMFO|1.0|When I came out of this movie and someone told me it was written by the same guy who wrote Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary, I was shocked to say the least. Where do I start to rip this sublime piece of crap a new one??? Hmmm, let me see... well, for starters the bloated cast. Don't get me wrong here,I like all of the actors in the movie, with the exception of the alien fish boy (who has a disturbingly large role for some reason)but there are so many couples with so many problems that talented actors like Liam Neeson are left with nothing to do but play foil to a disturbing fish kid. Oh yeah, and that's another thing kids, there are a ton of kids in this movie but they are all in scenes where the actors have nothing better to do than stand around saying \\"... this and sod that and ...'s yer uncle and bugger me!\\" and speaking of buggery for some reason they just keep throwing in these scenes with this couple doing stand-ins for a porno? It's ilke you're watching a G-rated romantic comedy and then all of a sudden BOOBS and not pretty boobs, Gwyneth Paltrow boobs. I'm talking deflated balloons nailed to a 2x4, gross, pale, english boobs. Ah well my ire is spent, do yourself a favor and skip this one; rent Notting Hill or Bridget instead, both are better films with plot lines that have a beginning, middle and end.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|I just received my copy of this DVD from Amazon, and it's a wonderful DVD. Any film footage from the Floyd during the 60's/70's is virtually non-existent, so this original film, shot in 1971 at this ancient Roman Amphitheatre, finds the band at their pinnacle, enjoying a momentum that would last, at least, until their 1977 &quot;In The Flesh&quot; tour. The tracks are wonderful, and the sound, despite only stereo, has been beautifully remastered.<br />Then, why did I give it only 4 out of 5 stars? Because the new &quot;Director's cut&quot; is kitschy at best. Full of computer generated &quot;space footage&quot; (awful), plus DSoTM era interviews (some of them truly revelatory, and wonderful to watch), director Adrian Maben put in everything he could, despite the fact that most of that material was totally unrelated to the Pompeii concert. Thankfully, on the &quot;bonus features&quot; section, Maben had the good taste to leave the original theatrical film -unedited and uncut-, where the band performs their music, warts and all, as nature intended, and as millions of fans all over the world watched it originally. In my humble opinion, I think that the DSoTM interviews should have been included as bonus features, having the original film under the spotlight.<br />But, rest assured that if you like the early Gilmour era Pink Floyd, you'll absolutely love this DVD. The music is incredible, and the band are in top form. This is, probably, the definitive Pink Floyd live film we'll have from the classic years (at least, until something is unearthed from the 1970/1977 period).
0142004235|5.0|I have to admit that I read this book because of the warm praises it received and how it touched so many lives. And...I have to agree.<BR>The book plays with the ultimate struggle with good and evil.  Cathy, symbolizing Satan, looks for the evil in each person and tries to draw it out and exploit it. Steinbeck says, \\"And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\" Cathy has to continue to change. She changes her name and story constantly. After the murder of her parents and the shooting of her husband, she changes to Kate and becomes a prostitute in a whorehouse.  This is the story of evil. Satan can always conceive new and creative ways to lure people to him and yet the evil always dies and is forgotten. On the other hand, virtue is remembered and honored from generation to generation. Samuel's teachings and philosophies are often relied on long after his death. Lee incorporates Samuel's teachings into his upraising of the Trask twins. Therefore, good always conquers in the end as it does in East of Eden. Cathy begins to realize reluctantly near the end of her life that the evil on which she thrived caused her downfall. She had trained herself never to trust anyone and in the end Cathy even began to doubt herself.<br />The most obvious case of an internal struggle between good and evil is present in Cal, whom I feel I strongly relate too. As a child, he is aware that his light-haired brother is favored over him by nearly everyone. When Cal finally confronts his mother, he believes that Adam loves Aron more because he looks like Cathy. Cal's peers are scared of him and he has no friends. The first young girl that that twins meet is won by Aron. Cal often feels that he has no choice in his evil actions. He believes that his mother's blood that runs through his veins causes him to be bad. Most of Cal's evil actions are merely because of his desire for love and acceptance. \\"...everyone in the world to a large or small extent has felt rejection...and there is the story of mankind.\\" Cal has felt this rejection throughout his entire life. He knows that Abra favors Aron so he tricks the young girl to try to win her love. But underneath Cal's harsh appearance, is an earnest desire to live a good life. He has a genuine love for Aron and a desire to protect his weaker sibling. \\"In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love.\\" In Cal, one can see the entire story of mankind unfold-the search for love, the feeling of rejection and hopelessness, and finally the acceptance of one's individuality. Steinbeck successfully created a story that will endure for generations because of its truth and honesty of the story of mankind and our constant battle between good and evil.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is easily the best post-rock album of the new millenium. i first heard it at a friend's house and bought it the next day. i have listened to all or part of this album EVERYDAY since i purchased it. This cd was the best ten dollars i have ever spent.
B00005JM02|5.0|I saw this movie last night.  I have to say that the movie totally sucked.  First of all, as ridiculous as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, in which human could fly, it's absurd that fish (and turtles and birds) talk in this movie.  Have you ever heard fish talk in the pet store?  That's my point.  My second objection relates to the fact that the characters are not developed enough.  I didn't feel that I even cared if Marlin found his son in the end or not.  I was not really able to relate to those fish at all.  I went to the theater having heard all the rave reviews and came out feeling ripped off.  But if you want to laugh your belly button off, forget about the world around you, and be immersed in the surreal world of underwater pain and happiness (a little like the Spongebob experience) this is an adorable movie.
B0000AI45P|4.0|Television wasn't punk.  A lot of people didn't like them in the olden days because they jammed too much, just like the Dead, and because of what many have described as a bad personality on the part of one of the dudes in the band.  In England, they treat &quot;Marquee&quot; as if it were one of the greatest records ever made.  Is it?  I dunno.  It's good--they're tasty, tasty guitar pickers, Verlaine and Lloyd, and some of what they lay down is pretty, as in &quot;Guiding Light.&quot;  Verlaine has a very annoying voice that works on this; in England, a lot of people got and get angry over the alleged bringdown of the followup to &quot;Marquee,&quot; &quot;Adventure.&quot;  He sings just the same on that one, and on his first couple solo records.  I always liked &quot;Dreamtime&quot; myself; it's the only other thing by Mr. Verlaine I would call essential.  Richard Lloyd sounded out of it on solo records like &quot;Alchemy,&quot; which is kind of charming but not the kind of thing to make a man like him into the rock star he probably needed to be.  &quot;Little Johnny Jewel&quot; is a good bonus track here, and this is a very nice record--overrated, as most of these kinda things are, but good, good, so spend your money on it and you won't be sorry!
B00008VGL6|4.0|This album of covers from Martin really does deliver despite what you may have heard. Far superior to many of the originals, stays true to DM and really takes you away to a dream world. It has this mesmirizing quality that I can't really put my finger on. You just have to listen. It loses it towards the end, but still well worth the money. I think DM still have a few more great albums in them. Exciter I thought was quite good, Ultra I LOVEd, SOFAD is their best I think, not enough praise is given to that album. Keep going guys.
B0000AI45P|3.0|good, good, so spend your money on it and you won't be sorry!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Having read a few negative reviews about the Revolutions, I wanted to drop in my five cents.  What this movie lacked in romance and dialogue, it more than made up in action and special effects.  Here are some comments:<br />1.  What's with Neo's child dialogues?  \\"I have decided to bla bla bla..\\"  Trinity asks: \\"why?\\" \\"Because I bla bla..\\"  \\"What?\\"... And it goes on.  The brothers need to work on the scripts.<BR>2.  In the Revolutions, Morpheus was a follower rather than a leader.  He had lost all his charisma that we were used to in the Matrix and Reloaded.  Moreover, I was expecting more romance between Naobi and Morpheus, maybe in place of the lousy dialogue about change.<BR>3.  Is the senate abnormally calm or what!  Just like the machines.. Such an irony.<BR>4.  Cool story line.  I liked how it all linked to one another in the end.  However the end was expected, specifically from the speech that Senate member gave to Neo about how humans needed the machines and the humans needed machines (Reloaded).<br />Anyway, long story short, watch the movie.  It is worth the time and money.
0451169514|3.0|I really enjoyed the book. The powerful construction of the characters makes it one of the best in-depth books I've ever read that really explores the human nature. Unless you were a &quot;loser&quot; when you were a kid, you wouldn't be able to identify with the characters. Fortunately, King caters for all by including several types of losers -- a fat kid, one who has an obscene and vulgar father, one with an overprotective mother, a stutterer, and one who can't keep his mouth shut and wears glasses. The character development on its own is utterly stunning and for that and the plot of the story (which I wont bore you with since most people here have already described it), earn the title 3 stars. <br />Two stars were deducted for the simple fact that the story dragged on and on for over 1100 pages in the edition I read. Contrary to most readers, I thoroughly enjoyed Mike's interludes, but this does NOT remove the notion that this book should have been greatly edited, since I feel several pages of the book could have been removed without much overall harm to the storyline.<BR>Also, the ending was a disappointment. The &quot;final battle&quot; is not really satisfying, and is overall disappointing, though finishing the story left me feeling empty for a couple of days, missing the characters. But the continuity of the story really suffered because its structure was so disorganized, that I sometimes I stayed away from the book for a while every now and then because I got a bit bored.
B000055ZDT|5.0|As far as the genre of doom-metal is concerned, this si the best band and album there is. If you've never heard electric wizard before, here it now. The guitar sound is unbelievable. It sounds like a plane crash or somehting. Awesome.
B00005JMFR|1.0|I won't be long.  I've ranted enough already.  This movie was terrible!  The Matrix has been an obsession of mine for the past couple of years, mostly because of the philosophical ideas presented and the cool kung-fu stunts.  This movie was a completely unsatisfying climax to two great, thought-provoking, and original films.  Let's see... about 2% of this movie deals with the ideas in the first two films... there are, maybe 3 scenes with the kung-fu we all know and love, one scene with bullet time and a climax that makes sense I guess, but did the Wachowski brothers really need two other movies to give us this??  I give it one star because there was a little, precious little, substance to this film and because I can't give it zero stars.  Don't waste your time, people.  Just read reviews with spoilers.  Believe me- you won't be missing much at all that you liked in the first two.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Many people who have seen this movie believe that it doesn't successfully conclude the trilogy. Why? Well, it should be obvious... they don't understand the ending. And to be honest with you, I don't completely understand it either. But that doesn't mean I'm going to criticize it based on that; it is, after all, a philosophical movie. But to make an attempt at clarification, I will point out some things that I found significant.<br />Let's start at the beginning, since that would seem most reasonable. It starts out where it left off: Neo and Bane lying opposite each other on tables. Notice that they're wearing the exact same clothes and look like reflections of one another. Then, there is the scene with the train station. If you think about it, the train station is a kind of purgatory where you are transported one way or the other. Mobil Ave on the back wall is Latin for \\"Hail Transportation.\\" While in this place, Neo reads like someone who is jacked in. The mind is the ultimate matrix and evidence of this is that they can't \\"see\\" Neo while he's in the Matrix.<br />(...) Don't jump to conclusions because if you do, you'll miss a conclusion altogether.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I am the last person to be a Madonna fan, remembering the Material Girl. My tastes run from reggae/ska to ballet music to Miles Davis - eclectic? A friend recommended this, and it blew me away. I am impressed with Madonna's honesty and continuing re-making of herself. I respond mainly as someone who had the early loss of a parent,  as has Madonna . . . always searching for that lost self, or trying/having to create a new self. Madonna's daughter is at about the age that Madonna lost her own mother. Now that she is a parent, Madonna is revealing a whole new identity.   &quot;Mother and Father,&quot; and &quot;Die another day,' knocked me out.<BR>But the whole album is powerful.<BR>She MAY shed this skin, also, and find other identities, but for now I salute where she's coming from and am enjoying this incarnation.
B000002J6F|4.0|After the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" and The Who's TOMMY, it became fashionable for artists to record a \\"double album\\". The unfortunate consequence was that, under the necessity of filling two vinyl discs, material was included that might otherwise have been left on the \\"cutting room floor\\", so to speak. Double albums were a stretch and, as a result, tended to be somewhat uneven.<br />MANASSAS was, at once, a band put together by Stephen Stills, the name of the album released by that band, and Stephen Stills' double album. Despite the presence of other well-known musicians, the album is very much a Steve Stills project from beginning to end. The band is very good and the musicianship is tight, but Stills is out in front throughout. He plays the leads, he's the lead singer, and he wrote almost all of the material.<br />MANASSAS is organized into four sections, corresponding to the four sides of the original two discs, and each has its own sub-title. The first, titled \\"The Raven\\", prominently displays latin, jazz and blues influences. It includes \\"Jet Set (Sigh)\\", a blues-based rocker that is my favorite song on the album. The second section, \\"The Wilderness\\", has a strong country-western flavor. It's a bit too twangy for my taste, and is my least favorite part of the album, but has some nice moments. Third is \\"Consider\\", a section of essentially folk-rock tunes. \\"How Far\\", another favorite of mine, is found here. The last section, \\"Rock And Roll Is Here To Stay\\", is basicaaly straight-up rock although it has a short, bluesy finale.<br />I've always regarded Stills as a pretty significant rock artist. His credentials are impressive, beginning with Buffalo Springfield and continuing through the various permutations of CSN and CSN&Y, Manassas and solo efforts that were, in some instances, quite good. Though he has been referred to as \\"not the most accomplished\\" member of CSN, I think that point could be argued. He's probably the most prolific, has probably penned the most hits, and is probably the most versatile. In my mind, he's the lynchpin of CSN (&Y perhaps, given Neil Young's erratic level of participation). Crosby and Nash certainly never got far commercially without him. He can be criticized for sometimes releasing music that was over-produced, perfunctory and/or self-indulgent, but he has been responsible for some inarguably great music, as well. MANASSAS is one of his better moments.<br />MANASSAS is not, in my opinion, an essential rock album. It isn't one of my ten all-time favorites, either. The material is stretched a little thin and is a bit uneven, overall. Those statements alone will probably make me unpopular amidst all of the five-star ratings here. The other side of the coin, however, is that this IS a very good album. There's lots of good,  listenable music, and the band is excellent. Moreover, what was once a \\"double album\\" at a \\"double album\\" price is now a single CD at a single CD price. A bargain. Enough so that I bought the CD, even though I bought MANASSAS in LP format when it was originally released. It's not quite a five-star classic in my book, but definitely worth having. You'll especially want it if you like Stills' performances with either Buffalo Springfield or CSN (&Y).its, and is probably the most versatile.

B00005JMFR|1.0|.....So I was one of those geeky people who bought their tickets for the first day, 2nd showing of Matrix Revolutions.  I had also done the same with the Reloaded sequel.  The 2nd film....I thought was actually horrible AND boring!  I wanted my $$ back, but most importantly, I wanted my 2+ hours back!!!  Same with this third installment.  Take ALL of the horrible cliches from EVERY war movie you've ever seen, and put it in this one!  The young kid, not really old enough to be in 'the army', the spouse who thinks their partner is dead, so sarifices themselves for the greater good, the 'hardened' old army guy who fights 'til his last breath.  UG!  The first 20 minutes of the film made me have hope that THIS sequel would finally redeem the entire series! BUT NO!  To top it all off...the ending isn't really an ending...please hope there isn't a 4th one!  A word of advice to people out there...pretend like this is the Highlander movie franchise...the first one is the REAL movie and the rest were just bad dreams!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE FIRST MATRIX FILM, don't get me wrong!!   PLEASE RENT IT WHEN IT COMES OUT ON DVD -- That way you can turn it off!!
B000092Q4U|5.0|In my opinion, Lamb of God is probably the fastest rising band out of this whole New Wave of American Heavy Metal shxt. Man, these guys have toured non-stop, have had their videos played countless times on the Ball, and just recently, they signed to Epic. I see them being the headliners of the second stage of next year's Ozzfest. Well, anyways, here's my review of their album:<br />I was blown away when I first heard this album. Right now, it's a 4 way tie for best album of the year also including Mushroomhead, Chimaira, and Dimmu Borgir. The musicianship is incredible on this. Metal bands, take notes, cause this stuff is top notch. Like Chimaira, their sopomore effort has way better production (thanks to Mr. Devin Townsend). The album begins with a bang with &quot;Ruin.&quot; Full on mosh music, until the bridge, where there's a ripping solo. Great stuff. The title track is probably the fastest one on here. Heavy riffs, lighting-fast drumming, and evil vocals, make this a fav. <br />I'm sure everyone by now has heard &quot;11th Hour.&quot; Probably the catchiest tune on here. It reminds me Pantera, until the last minute of the song, where it goes full on speed. My fav. on here has to be &quot;Blood Junkie.&quot; The music on here reminds me of Meshuggah. Every 10 sec. it has speed changed, and heavy ass breakdowns. Plus, Chris Adler goes nuts on the drums.<br />Anyways, for people who haven't given new school metal a chance, you will instantly respect Lamb of God. Scott Ian siad it best. It's like Reign in Blood all over again.
B000062YAZ|5.0|The 80's sucked. Almost the only good music was thrash metal. There was Venom, and Metallica, then Slayer really took it to the next level. It's very fast, very heavy. This was as far (as history has proven) the Thrash metal experiment could go-after this, there is only noise (which sounds good sometimes, but ain't metal). Hardcore punk fans loved this (and afterall, Hardcore was always more metal than punk anyway). 28 minutes, the lyrics are throwbacks to Led Zep and kingdom Come I guess, but mainly to Black Sabbath (very visual and depressing/occult lyrics). The guitar players screech the leads, play typical thrash rythms (but faster); the drummer is s blur; the singer moves between screams, growls, and the occaional screech. unbeleivably powerful.

B00005JLEX|1.0|Jon,<BR>Baboo is from Pakistan, not India.<br />With all these complaints about personal Seinfeld tape recordings  being unreliable, with inferior quality, and aging etc, why not just get a DVD set-top recorder already and record your favorites onto recordable DVD?  Sounds like the reason why SeinDVDs aren't out yet are for the fact that everyone watches them on TV and the fanbase increases and increases worldwide....and it's still making money on the TV.   If people really want DVD,  stop watching them on the TV :)   A whole season would be what....like $50 or more?   Multiply that by 9 and you have $450.  Add a inflation equal to the time it takes for all 9 seasons to be available and you have maybe $700+ cost.  Invest that money in a set-top DVD recorder and record your own personal  favorites like you would  VCR.  The commercials would be a nostaglic  :O)   Cause who really cares to watch all of the episodes.  And remember this... SEINFELD will always be on the tube.

B0000DBJDM|3.0|Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii <br />Pros:<br />On DVD - Finally! <br />Sharp picture and outstanding stereo audio!<br />The original concert footage from the 1971 Film is included as a Extra Feature.<br />Fantastic pre-Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd space music.<br />The additional black & white interview footage from Paris in 1972.<br />Cons:<br />The so called \\"Director's Cut\\".  What a travesty!  <br />Directior Adrian Maben seems like an intelligent man in his interview included on the DVD. <br />However, this so-called extended \\"Director's Cut\\" is a  good lesson in how to botch a really great concert film with bad editing and just plain stupidity.  It is difficult to believe that the members of Pink Floyd approved of these unbelievably inept changes.<br />The director's extras really detract from a pleasurable viewing of this film. For example:<br />Cheesy, worthless animation, inserted in the most inappropriate places. Even the animation of the reconstruction of Pompeii during Echoes part II adds nothing to the film. <br />Shots of a Subway (and a shot of an empty Subway station) during Echoes part I.  A truly bizarre decision. St. John's Wood? What could possibly be relevant about this random insertion?<br />Other random shots of modern day Pompeii - pointless and distracting.<br />Very Poor conception - Adrian Maben's idea of a rocket taking off from an outer space world and coming to earth to listen the the Pink Floyd concert at Pompeii is completely laughable.  As a result we get cheap space animation of planets and space travel which simply do not work on any type of conceptual level with this film.<br />Unfortunately, no additional film footage remains - it cannot be found.  The lost footage would have been a great addition to the extended version of the film and could have made for a decent Director's Cut.<br />Lack of the inclusion of the full 1974 release of the film which includes band interviews and DSotM studio sessions. These are included in the Director's Cut - but is it really worth watching again?<br />The ONLY reason I would recommend this film is for the Extra Feature that contains the concert footage only from the original 1971 film.  Five Stars for the Original Concert Footage on DVD!

6304806418|5.0|The life of Eva Peron is one that has intrigued many throughout the years. Even before Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice decided to write a musical about her brief but amazing life, there were others who had tried to revive her legend. There was a short lived off-broadway play called \\"The Diamond Orchid\\" which was loosely based on her life, a soft-core European movie titled \\"Little Mother\\" released in the early 70's and a short lived French play titled \\"Eva Peron by Copi\\" which had the role of Evita played by a Transvestite. But it wasn't until the release of a double album in 1976 by Lloyd Webber and Rice that made Evita famous once again. 20 years later, after many false go-aheads, the film version was finally released.<br /><br />The musical traces the brief but meteoric rise of Maria Eva Duarte de Peron. Her sudden rise from childhood poverty to becoming one of the world's most powerful woman, made her a hero to some, a power hungry villain to others. The movie, like the woman, was controversial. Even after the movie was over many were still left with the questions, was she a Saint or a Sinner? Good or Bad? Was she the Savior to Argentina's \\"shirtless\\" ones or a Monstrous dictator to the well-to-do? People will just have to come up with their own conclusions but having studied the subject for over 12 years now, I must state that you should not take a Broadway/Hollywood musical as a history lesson. Especially when the subject matter is someone who's as complicated as Eva Peron. Both Peronists and Anti-Peronists agree- the woman was an enigma, a paradox. We may never know the whole truth. However the facts should be noted. Her foundation built over 1000 schools (according to historians although the totals vary), over 100 hospitals, thousands of homes for the poor, several orphanages, old age homes, shelters for runaway girls, shelters for unwed mother, a complete miniature village for children, and youth hostels all between 1948-1952. Health care became free to the poor and the mortality rates among children improved and many diseases such as cholera and TB were reduced. She also sat in her office for 15-20 hours a day receiving the poor up until the last year of her life. She would visit shanty towns and personally give out food, sugar or a bottle of cider. She would pick up homeless people off the streets and take them back, in her limousine, to the residential palace where she would bathe them and feed them. Many have laughed at the idea of Eva Peron being referred to as \\"Santa Evita\\" (Saint Evita) but the above accomplishments are the reasons as to why so many thought of her as a Saint. And then of course there is the darker aspects of her character which are emphasized in the Black Myth. Her undying loyalty to her husband and his cause, her driving ambition, her alleged ruthlessness, her determination to succeed no matter what the cost. What is the point of these ramblings? Well, her career, her legend is far too complex to explain in a 2 hours musical that is largely based on gossip and supposition.<br /><br />Moving on to the movie and it is beautifully filmed with sumptuous costumes, glorious sets and Lloyd Webber's score is one of his best. Many have complained about the repetitiveness of the music but objectively speaking, you can't really write a rock opera (no spoken dialogue) without recycling some of the tunes and a lot of contemporary theatre composers repeat the main tunes throughout their score. You can't expect Sir. Lloyd Webber to write a new tune for every single sung phrase, let's be realistic. He is not the first and certainly won't be the last contemporary theatre composer to repeats his melodies throughout. Speaking of the music- it ranges from exciting- \\"Buenos Aires\\", \\"Rainbow High\\" (my personal favorite) to theatrical-\\"A New Argentina\\", \\"Rainbow Tour\\", to haunting- \\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\\", \\"Another Suitcase In Another Hall\\", \\"You Must Love Me\\". It is true that the score had to be modifiedto better suit Madonna's range but in actuality she never sounded better. Madonna's passion for the role is clearly evident in her performance. We saw Eva's passion, power, ambition and pain. We were charmed by her youthful vitality in the first half of the film (despite looking much older than 15), moved by her sincere attempt to win acceptance in the middle and saddened by the pain of her ravaged body in the final frames. The physical resemblance was also striking. However, I must state that Eva Peron at her physical peak (before the cancer destroyed her appearance) had a particularly unique aspect to her beauty. Many have resembled her or at least tried to resemble her but the original woman had characteristics that made her beauty and elegance stand out. Looking at the several picture magazines of the time period and the newsreel footage of her, she was a larger than life persona with an aura of a goddess- the song \\"Rainbow High\\" is very accurate in its treatment of her elegance during that stage in her life where high maintenance glamour was at the forefront.<br /><br />Being a fan and collector of Eva Peron, I have read and collected several magazines and books- I have over 100 in my collection, and I still find her story fascinating. Although the musical \\"Evita\\" is biased and one-sided, the stage version of the show captivated me from the opening number to the final scene so I was eagerly anticipating the release of the movie musical version. Almost 20 years separate the original stage version and the movie version and there were some changes made, most notably- Eva Peron's character was portrayed more sympathetically. Many felt that the reason for this was solely because the makers needed Former Argentine President Carlos Menem's approval so they could use the Presidential Palace in the celebrated balcony scene. Anyone who has read Alan Parker's Book, \\"The Making of Evita\\" will know that that is not entirely true. There have been many books about Eva Peron published since the opening of the stage musical but at the time when Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice decided to write a musical about Evita, there were not that many biographies on the subject. The only major biography available at the time was Mary Main's hostile and inaccurate \\"The Woman With the Whip\\". Notable historians of Eva Peron (Maryssa Navarro, Nicholas Fraser, J M Taylor, Alicia Dujovne Ortiz and even Alan Parker) have denounced this book since the books author was a rich Anglo-Argentine who used the opposition as her informants and her book (although well written) is a malicious, anti-Peronist and damaging view of Eva's life. She accuses Eva Peron of every unpleasant act known to man. Stating she slept her way to the top is one thing but accusing someone of murder and torture without having the slightest shred of evidence is pretty irresponsible- Mary Main even states in her book ...\\"there is no proof\\". Alan Parker and Madonna who had read every book there was on Evita took this into consideration and is why they chose to portray a more balanced view of the woman.<br /><br />\\"Chicago\\" (2002), is being credited as the film that revived the movie musical and although it is entertaining and technically well made, it was by no means (and I know that many would agree) the best film of the year. \\"Evita\\" pre-dates \\"Chicago\\" by many years and was the first major musical to come from Hollywood since \\"Grease\\". \\"Evita\\" is rarely given credit for breathing new life to a movie genre that had been dead for nearly 2 decades. In 1996 \\"Evita\\" (and Madonna) was snubbed by the Oscar's- although the movie did receive 5 Oscar nominations and it did win 3 Golden Globes, it didn't receive a nomination for \\"Best Picture\\" or \\"Best Director\\". Whether you loved the movie or hated it, one has to admit that Alan Parker did an extraordinary job in transferring the musical from stage to screen.<br /><br />In closing, \\"Evita\\" - the movie, like the woman herself, is a love it or hateit type of experience. Many will hate the subject matter, the politics, the fact that there is no spoken dialogue (rock operas/sung-through musicals are an acquired taste). Others will take offense at the film's so called glorification of an \\"immoral\\" and beautiful fascist leader. But for those wanting to experience something a little different- a Hollywood-esque attempt at a history lesson with some tango, pop, and theatre thrown in, \\"Evita\\" may be the movie for you. Give it a chance and you just might fall under the seductive spell of the elegantly dressed and bejeweled temptress in front of the microphone.

B0000AI44Q|5.0|As 57 year old \\"child of the 60's\\" and former 70's and early 80's FM Radio Rock DJ, and guitarist, I've been a fan and close follower of Neil's music, and politics (the two are often inseperable) from the beginning, and own a fairly complete library of his works. I haven't always liked everything Neil has done and I can be critical of his music (and politics). I've also never felt compelled to write a review before, so believe me when I say that Greendale really grabbed me. This is Neil Young from the very bottom of his soul and at his very best! Neil has gone back to the classic Concept (album) format to tell an ingeniously entertaining tale and deliver his message of peace, love and respect for planet Earth. Characters that captivate the imagination, tongue in cheek humor, some directed at Neil himself, tragedy, death and serious message intertwine throughout. The electric music on the CD is simply great basic from the gut blues based Rock-n-Roll, including great guitar chops, Neil, not trying to be dazzling or fancy, just delivering solid riffs and solos that have me listening time and again. To top it all off the Bonus DVD solo acoustic performance recorded in a small club in Ireland is more than worth the price alone. Thousands of words will be written about Greendale but in my estimation one word says it all, BRILLIANT! Unfortunately, in today's sad narrow minded rock and roll radio market the general public isn't likely to hear much, if any, of Greendale. As previously mentioned I've never felt compelled to write an online review before but listen to Greendale and you too will likely be driven to spread the word. Collectively, we owe that to Neil for coming up with such a great work absoultely worthy of multi-Platinum sales status. Thanks, Neil Young, for more great music I will enjoy for the rest of my life.
0790744295|2.0|When I was a horror movie loving kid growing up in the 70's and 80's, there were many genre films I wanted to see but didn't dare watch because they looked so scary when their trailers aired on T.V, \\"Creepshow\\" being one of them. Now that I'm (a bit) older and have viewed most, if not all of these films that once instilled fear in me, I can't figure out why I was so scared of this film? Good marketing I guess? \\"Creepshow\\" has to be one of the un-scariest movie ever made. Not only does it lack thrills and chills, it's pathetically over the top, loud, and cheesy. The cheese factor may have been done purposely since they were trying to recreate the comic book style but the end result is an over-acted mess of a horror film that is too quirky to be scary. That said, it still entertains. Why? Because it's absolutely hilarious and some of the performances are good- especially Adrienne Barbeau who plays a rather unpleasant but likeable shrew.<br /><br />The special effects, for the most part, are pretty atrocious. I understand the film was made over 20 years ago but that doesn't excuse the poorly constructed make-up effects. Considering this was a star studded Hollywood production more care should have been taken, unless they purposely designed these ghouls and monsters to look fake. If that was the case, then mission accomplished or they may have run out of money on several of these stars salaries.<br /><br />I think I would have liked the movie better had they not had the awful second story which stars the charmless and goofy Stephen King. Mr. King may be a good horror writer but he is not much of an actor. As a matter of fact, he is rather irritating and lacks on screen charisma. Since he was the sole protagonist of that lacklustre tale, it made it all the more unbearable. The plant effects and its fluorescent hue looks like something straight out of a failed science fair project.<br /><br />Admittedly, the idea is rather interesting for a horror movie and I am a big fan of horror anthologies but a lot in this movie was poorly done. It's even more grating when the talent involved is taken into consideration. Romero and King have done way better than this. The film is ambitious but childish and the end result is as scary as an episode of \\"Dennis the Menace\\".<br /><br />Has it's moments but overall, very disappointing.of horror anthologies but a lot in this movie was poorly done.

B000002UVX|3.0|Jimi Hendrix and The Band Of Gypsys played a few fillmore east concerts. This CD covers only six songs from there two concerts they played at fillmore east. I was in disapointment buying this CD. If your looking to buy this CD then think again. If you really wanted to listen to the full length fillmore concerts then buy the Experience Hendrix version Live At Fillmore East double disc CD with kick ass booklet. The Experience Hendrix version is 90% better than this CD. Still im not going to diss this CD cause its still great atleast the six songs are but I still think the Experience Hendrix version is way better. I rated this a 3 out of 5.
B000059PPN|3.0|Typical gory Fulci fare about a young family who settles into a creepy, run down house that comes complete with cobwebs, killer bats and a beast in the cellar. The lovely Catriona MacColl returns and gives (as usual) a very good performance. The child actor in the film is adorable but whatever cuteness he possesses goes right out the window because he becomes increasingly irritating as the film moves along thanks largely to the horrible dubbing. It sounds like adults were used to dub the children's voices and the end result is extremely annoying.<br /><br />Before I mention the gore/violence, I do want to point out that the film's score, at times, is beautiful. Many scenes in the film are enhanced by the melodic yet eerie score such as the scene in the beginning, after the opening gore sequence, when a seemingly lost child looks out from her house's front window and her image is frozen on screen as the main child actor contemplates her frozen image in an old photograph. The brief scene is rather poignant and poignant is not a word I use to describe a Fulci film, yet the music is the star of that particular scene.<br /><br />Despite the poignant moment described and the repulsive gore that is on display, \\"The House by the Cemetery\\" is one Fulci's slowest moving pictures. It opens with a couple of brutal slaying's but you'll have to wait at least another 30 minutes before another life is extinguished so those who are expecting a fast paced slasher film need to remember that this film moves at it's own pace. However, during it's few key moments, it delivers the gore in abundance and Fulci, as expected, leaves nothing to the imagination. There are head stabbings, throat-ripping's, and one of the most disturbing scenes involves a gorgeous actress loosing her head. What disturbed me about this movie was how well done many of these gore sequences were especially when the films obvious low budget is taken into consideration. For a moment there, it had me questioning my morals as a human being. Why do I like seeing innocent people suffer like this on screen? Why do I enjoy seeing innocent people being savagely carved up & slaughtered? I honestly can't answer these questions. I watch horror movies not because I enjoy watching horrible things happen to good people but mostly for the shock and the adrenaline pump that is sometimes felt when something unexpected or revolting is put on for your display. Whatever the reasons may be for enjoying the genre, this film did leave me with a very uncomfortable feeling after viewing it.<br /><br />So please keep this in mind, if you can stomach the repulsiveness of these films, you should find \\"House by the Cemetery\\" interesting viewing and the three star rating I gave the film is solely for those who like this sort of morbid unpleasantness. All others, avoid at all costs. You will do yourself a dis-service by viewing these types of films.ls as a human being. Why do I like seeing innocent people suffer like this on screen?

0385504209|4.0|One of the members of my book club recommended this book and I purchased it, aware of some of the things revealed within this mystery/thriller.  But not all of them - I had never heard of the Priory of Sion. It's a good read - quite revealing.  As someone who appreciates the artwork of Leonardo DaVinci, I found the information about the &quot;secrets&quot; behind his paintings very interesting.<br />&quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; is best read with an open mind.  Believe it or not - or choose to simply look at it as a fictional book wrapped in what some claim to be historical fact. It's worth the read.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I give LOTR The Two Towers five stars. It is among the best movies ever made. And those Tolkien purists who complain about the differences between the books and the movies don't understand that the love story of Arwen and Aragorn was really close to Tolkien's heart.<br />The love story of Arwen and Aragorn is not found in the LOTR story itself, although it is found in an Appendix in Vol 3 ROTK, and is also found in Tolkien's Silmarillion. And so we know that the story is based on the love story of Beren (mortal man) and Luthien (immortal elf-maiden). In the movie FOTR (extended version), Aragorn as much as tells us this himself, when he sings the song about Beren and Luthien while he leads the hobbits in the wilderness on their way to Weathertop.<br />The love story of Beren and Luthien was important to Tolkien. After the Hobbit was a smashing success in 1937, the publisher asked Tolkien if he had any more material to be published. Tolkien gave him the story of Beren and Luthien, as part of the Silmarillion. The publisher declined to publish this story, preferring instead to print a sequel to the Hobbit. As we all know, this sequel is LOTR...<br />And here's the reason why the story of Beren and Luthien was so important to Tolkien. Beren is Tolkien himself, and Luthien is Edith Mary, the sweetheart of Tolkien's youth, whom he married in 1916, and faithfully adored until her death in 1971, two years before Tolkien himself died. You can see the inscription on their tombstone in the Wolvercote Cemetery in the northern suburbs of Oxford, UK ([...]<br />When Tolkien wrote that Luthien was the fairest elf that ever lived, he was writing about his wife. And when Peter Jackson decided that his movies should showcase the themes that Tolkien really cared about, he knew what he was doing when he included the love story of Arwen and Aragorn.
0385504209|3.0|Interesting and enjoyable if you have a taste for historical mystery and drama. Read it straight thru until 3am which is a good sign - I didn't want to put it down.

Anyone who writes a 5 paragraph review about a book they did not like - including this nonsense: &quot;How did it cross the equinoctial border that divides summer reading from autumnal brooding?&quot; probably shouldn't be ripping on the writing skills of a best selling author.

Its like a plague that has all the producers and even veiwers screaming and hooting for stupid impossible stunts...For instance in the ending two people fall off a 15 story building and they both survived...it was a sign  that killed them when it fell from the same location...I have to also say that the dvd does not have any fun bonuses and i would not even consider ever watching another CA movie ever again...

B00004U8JV|3.0|Spielberg never seems to pass up an opportunity to preach to the crowd and JP2 is no exception. His main thrust is the usual  predictable Hollywood eco-wacko worship of &quot;nature&quot;, usually based on the twisted propaganda of Greenpeace and others of their ilk.<br />Protecting the environment is a good thing and if the dinosaurs in question had been discovered as survivors of the reptile age in some remote part of Antarctica then taking extreme action to protect them would be justifiable. However the dinosaurs in question are not really dinosaurs but artificially created creatures that are part frog anyhow. They are not real dinosaurs. They have not been raised in the real Jurassic environment (we'll ignore that T-Rexes are from the Cretacious period not the Jurassic for simplicities sake). There is little to be learned from studying them. So the comments of various characters that messing with the pseudo-dinosaur part-frog creatures is wrecking some sort of ecological system is bogus. The pseudo-dinosaur part-frog creatures are interlopers into a real ecological system and it is the pseudo-dinosaur part-frog creatures that are ruining the ecology of the islands.<br />In fact, eco-wackos are always going on about how evil humans are wrecking the environment by introducing foreign species that wipe out the native ones. So the Eco-terrorist phony journalist character from Greepeace should be helping the hunters capture the darned things!! In addition to this the eco-terrorist directly precipitates the death of the first guy in Goldblum's party by stupidly taking a wounded faux T-Rex baby to their camp. This in addition to his criminal act of releasing the pseudo-dinosaur part-frog creatures which destroy the hunters' camp, eventually resulting in the slaughter of almost all of them. The eco-wacko journalist character should have been arrested, tried for the deaths he caused and permanently removed from society. Either life at hard labor or execution would be fine. He is protecting animals that are not even real dinosaurs! And he has no justification under the Endangered Species Act to do so. Especially on foreign soil.<br />The pseudo-dinosaur part-frog creatures were created by the Ingen corporation, were they not? So how on earth can Ingen be considered evil for simply making use of the things? Anyone who buys dead animals to eat at the supermarket is also to be reviled I guess. Ingen spent a lot of money developing these creatures, so whatever else their faults they deserve some credit, don't they? Not in Spielberg's mind.<br />The movie moves into utter silliness with the pseudo-dinosaur part-frog faux T-Rex's foray into SanDiego. We'll pass over just how the faux T-Rex managed to kill the entire ship's crew and then lock itself up in the hold. (Maybe it was the severed arm that cleverly waited until the T-Rex went back in the hold and then lowered the doors.) Faux T-Rex runs down the dock and destroys the big sign that proclaims the authority of the United States of America. This is supposed to symbolize that the US is powerless against pseudo-dinosaur part-frog creatures, I guess. However this is not true and any US Marine company has the fire power with its heavy weapons to easily slaughter any number of pseudo-dinosaur part-frog creatures. <br />Enough lecturing. Still, the movie is entertaining. The added unintentional laughs that result from Spielberg's eco-wackoism only add to the entertainment value.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I am truly one of the biggest Matrix fans there is, but I simply cannot recommend this film.  The special effects were nothing short of spectacular.  Beyond that, I was bored out of my skull.  I loved the first episode (and have watched it about 50 times), was luke warm about Reloaded (bought the DVD), and was utterly disappointed with Revolutions.  There really wasn't any advancement of the story, just dialog to fill in between the action scenes.  And the ending...what ending???  Where's Neo?  Dead?  Injured?  Transformed?  <br />Just a note on the action scenes - how is it that Zion didn't fall in about 2 minutes?  Thousands of sentinals vs. about 100 APU's, not much of a match.  All-Powerful Neo seems to get his butt kicked a little too much in this installment.  Isn't this the same guy who could stop Sentinals with his mind?  Too many inconsistancies in this movie, so many that it became distracting.  I know that this is an \\"adventure\\" movie, but there is only so much disbelief that I can suspend. <br />Lastly, I can do without all of the sentimental love scenes.  Come on...how long does it take a person impaled with several steel rods to die?  I could have lived without the 10 minute \\"I love you\\" speech.  We know they loved each other!!!  <br />With all this being said, I will probably still run out and get the DVD when it's released.
B000059T1G|4.0|In a way, this is not really a Traffic album.  This album was prompted by the fact that Traffic had officially disbanded, with Winwood off to join Blind Faith.  Island decided to capitalize (literally) on the media blitz that surrounded the Blind Faith 'supergroup', and scraped together studio outtakes from their first two albums and a live performance as a trio, recorded during one of Mason's many hiatus'.  The Studio outtakes comprise side 1 (on the original album), and actually hang together pretty well, aside from the throwaway instrumental &quot;Something's Got A Hold Of My Toe&quot;.  It's side 2 that, to me, is a waste.  Winwood provides the (pedal) bass line and organ parts, and is not able to play any guitar or piano.  He's an excellent musician, but seems very restricted in this context.  The bass lines are understandably simple, as his right hand has to provide the harmonic foundation of the song.  An interesting live experiment, but NOT anywhere close to the best live traffic.  <br />If you're a Traffic fan, you should probably own this, but it certianly isn't essential.
6304711905|3.0|&quot;Tombstone&quot; was not a bad movie.  It just doesn't stand out as a good movie.  The scenes tend to jump around a lot, and are choppy.  Overall, the movie seems rushed into production and forced.<br />Val Kilmer is wonderful in the role of Doc Holliday, and in addition the actor that played Virgil Earp really gave a great performance.  Kurt Russell did not make a convincing Wyatt Earp though.<br />If you are a big time fan of Western movies, you might like this film.  Its entertaining, and has its good moments.  If you're NOT a western film fan, rent it before buying.  This film is average to at best slightly above average overall.

From the lush string and brass and woodwind arrangements that are reminiscent of Capitol era Nelson Riddle charts to the pithy and vulnerable poetry that animates the verses of these songs, we are dealt a work that is perhaps too subtle for this vicious world.<BR>Too subtle for a bombastic culture that needs explosions, beer and<BR>cheek implants to get happiness in a digestible form. If on the other hand you are open to a musically polymath experience that encompasses the symphonic scope of Ravel, the social wit of a 21st century Cole Porter and the liquid vocal gift of the late Jeff Buckley then<BR>you are ready for &quot;Want One&quot;. The cheeky consumerism referenced in the title is I feel the one mistake of the whole album. &quot;Want&quot; by itself would have been far better as it distills the very notion of love, desire and creation. This is a landmark album in a sea of sameness, do not<BR>walk away from this record, it will like Picasso or Miles Davis, permanently improve life on earth.
0679731725|4.0|This story explores a world of Butlering that no one could possibly have imagined. When the average person thinks of Butlers they probably don't associate that field with excitement and yet this book which revolves around a Butler named Stevens and his reflections on his employers and his years in the field always keeps the reader turning to the next page. <BR> <BR>The story is told from Steven's point of view and when reading this it felt almost satiric on the part of the writer. Stevens seems to take the world and the dilemma's of butlery in high seriousness, and the reader will probably find this humorous. It is this seriousness towards running a household and his profession that make this such an enjoyable read because a reader cannot help but be amused by all this. <br />There are many characters in this books all seen through Stevens eyes and their interactions with the main character are quite amusing. The back and forth dialogue alone is worth reading this book just for the witticisms and entertaining banter. It is because of this dialogue that many fun nuances wander through the pages of the book, building up tension. This nuance helps the reader to both sympathize with Stevens based off certain events in the story and at the same time feel angry with him for his selfish behavior. It beg the question: Is there such a thing as too much professionalism?

B000065AI3|4.0|From a rock history perspective, this was an important record in the 1970s. It introduced a band with a refreshing back-to-roots sound at a time when commercial music had become stale. It was also an alternative to the other alternatives, punk and new wave. Someone who grew up on late 60's music didn't have to acquire any new tastes to enjoy this recording.  It was flawless, nearly every song became a staple of the Heartbreakers' live shows for a decade or more, and it deserves the 5-star reviews for all of that. Plus I personally love the record.<br />I'm taking off a star off for 3 reasons. First, two better records emerged soon after this one (Damn the Torpedoes and Hard Promises), and this shouldn't be rated as highly. Second, the sound hasn't aged as well as it has on those other two records. The songs remain great and are performed with passion, but most sounded like oldies when I listened to them today. I may be as old as Petty, but I tend to pop something that sounds a little more modern into the CD player. If I'm honest with myself, I'm more likely to listen to Echo when I'm in a Heartbreakers mood, even though it's a flawed and minor recording, than to this classic. Finally, younger generations of Tom Petty fans who discovered him at the Full Moon Fever stage or later simply may not enjoy the earlier sound. There have been lots of other great back-to-basics sounds in the last quarter century of rock music, and this CD having changed things in the mid-70's likely doesn't mean much to those who weren't there.<br />The songs are still great, the album was a major breakthrough, and I can listen to it and enjoy it. This is a band and singer and songwriter that had it together in a major way, and this is an obvious essential to serious Tom Petty fans. But it hasn't aged as well as some other, better recordings from the 70's. Other than American Girl, which still gives me chills, this CD often sounds dated. I'd point those who are unfamiliar with his early work and who are interested in it to Damn the Torpedoes or Hard Promises before they paid for this one.
0812550706|5.0|I was recommended this book by two friends while on a Spring Break trip as one of the greatest books EVER written (they were appalled that I had never heard of it before).  I couldn't pass up skipping that one now I decided.  I came home and started reading it and soon couldn't set it down!  I was so enthralled in the book that I spent every moment out of college and work reading it!  My girl-friend actually got jealous and upset that I was paying too much attention to the book and ignoring her and my studies!<BR>     It is enthrawling and suspenseful!  It is amazing to see Card's view of the future (as the book was written way back in 1985).  The strategies that Ender comes up to understand his enemies enlighten you to feel as if you are one of those smart children, like you know how he feels!  And with that understanding comes the capability to crush and destroy them in competition.  Yet he does not wish for power, or glory.  Everything is in this story that you could ever hope for...and just when you think the book is running out of time to get to a good ending...the surprise will blow you away.<BR>     I have not read a book like this in a VERY VERY long time.  It doesn't have any dull or slow moments, and it is hard to set down.
B0000027RL|3.0|Pearl Jam's first album is divided into two parts. The first half is full of great rock songs that radio stations love to play. The second half is for the fans. Songs like \\"Porch\\" and \\"Release\\" are boring for the average listener; the hooks are forgettable. But for the dedicated fan, you can find a certain blend of Neil Young and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in the second half, something that's all yours that the casual listeners will never pick up.<br />Overall, this is a surprisingly weak album. It's the sound of a band that's great live, but has trouble capturing that energy in the studio. This album turned grunge into classic rock, transforming the public image of the Seattle sound from lumberjack punks to sensitive heavy metal. Fortunately, Pearl Jam would go on to better things.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Phantom Menace was long awaited.  Lucas made a BIG MISTAKE in waiting so long to move back into bring the Star War Sagas to film.  The long long wait caused so much anticipation that I think before this movie was cursed with high expectations, so HIGH that it set up everyone for a BIG disappointment.<br />I have watched the film repeatedly, and I am left with the feeling - Lucas, you had ALL THESE YEARS, and this is what you settled for?  And I do mean settled.<br />Time has passed and we are Special Effects &quot;trained&quot;, so the power of Light and  Magic is sort of ho hum now...we except bigger and better and when we get it we go...is that all there is?  It would be curious...had Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones been released all those many years ago would they have impressed us more???<br />One only has to look to the brilliantly conceived and executed Lord of the Rings movies to see the ability to thrill us is there.  What is the different? - THE CHARACTERS.  You care so much for the struggles of Frodo, Aragon and the others...and in caring everything about the movie becomes more real, more vital.<br />You have a hard time caring about the characters in Both of the New Star Wars movies.  When you don't care, you are left with Special Effects.  They are great, but there should be writing and acting to SUPPORT THEM.<br />I enjoy the performances of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, but on the balance the sparkle has dimmed on the force.  The original movies worked because YOU CARED.  Think back when Harrison Ford was being frozen and the expression in his eyes and the expression in Carrie Fishers....they is what kept the movies special in everyone's heart.<br />One hopes the final instalment of this trilogy gets back to that.  Fun time, but it will not live long in your heart as a special film.  And please,GL, pay a little attention to better dubbing.  At times, this has plagued both films.<br />A fun time...but leaves you thinking you were somehow shortchanged.hanged.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Okay, I'm not going to go into all the small details that most people are complaining about on here.  I saw the movie last night and I thought it was pretty good.  I did like Reloaded a little better but I'm not disappointed with this one.  I DID have one problem with it, however.  They replaced the Oracle!  Okay, I've thought this through from the point of view of the story and I can't find a reason why they would do this.  There really was no reason to replace her, story-wise.  That means the reason had to be on the actress' end.  (I haven't heard anything on this, but if she died....that would be a good reason and I'll stop complaining real quick.  Hopefully, she didn't.)  Anyway, there must've been some dispute or something if that didn't happen. Regardless, the movie it'self was very good.  A great way to end the trilogy.  Taken as a whole (all three together as one movie), it's awesome.  All you people out there that tore this movie apart....try to look at it as one movie, not part 3.  You might see you like it more than you think.<br />Follow up:  Ah...I've just found out the acress that originally played the Oracle did die during the filming of the second movie.  Now it doesn't look that bad to me.  I just couldn't figure out why they would do that but the replacement did a decent job of acting like Gloria.  It's sad that she didn't get to finish a role that was really well done.  At least they found a way around her death for the sake of the story.  One last note:  After letting the movie sink in for a few days....I find I like it more and more.  A very good finale for a very good trilogy.  And next, it's almost time to end another great trilogy!  But we all know how it will end, huh?
B00005JMFI|5.0|This film was an early Christmas present... finally a Christmas film worth seeing, one you could take the kids (or even a date) to. 'Elf' was funny, and at times even heartwarming. The cast is great- Will Ferrell, Bob Newhart, James Caan, Ed Asner, and Mary Steenburgen are just a few of the key players. It's a new premise for a movie- a human raised by elves, only he doesn't know he's human until adulthood- and I, for one, was delighted with the plot. I will be seeing this one again, before the holidays, and I have been recommending it to everyone I know- especially those with children, and those people who don't enjoy the sex, violence, and bad language that is peppered throughout most movies anymore.
B0000A1HQP|4.0|First, you will laugh.  Then you will laugh more. At some point, you will feel the anger of Pierre Brochant and say to yourself, &quot;I have enough of this idiot!&quot; The next minute, you will be stomping and slapping, and laughing again.  You just don't know what will happen, or should I say what will go wrong!?<br />It is silly, but entertaining. Definitely a keeper!
0385512104|5.0|Christopher John Francis Boone cannot stand to be touched.  He relates well to animals, though, like his pet rat, Toby, and his neighbor's dog, Wellington.  He can calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head for fun...and uses this device when he faces something he cannot comprehend--like emotions.  Christopher is autistic.  When Wellington is killed with a garden fork, Christopher cannot help but find the killer.  He turns to his favorite fictional character to help him &quot;detect&quot; the clues he'll need, even though he &quot;doesn't like Arthur Conan Doyle.&quot;  His sleuth-work gets him into all kinds of trouble, not only with the local constabulary, but his father and neighbors as well.<br />Mark Haddon, author of this wonderful book, brilliantly makes Christopher his narrator--a boy unable to fathom emotions but telling a highly emotional tale.  The voice is fresh, the story engaging, and the plot twists enough to wrench the reader's heart, no matter how cynical.  I strongly recommend this novel...and if you enjoy it, also try &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; by Jonathan Lethem.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|I'm generally not a huge fan of live albums, but when I came across this concert performance of AC/DC, I just had to check it out.  \\"Live\\" is two plus hours of unadulterated hard rock that's everything we could expect from these guys.  The group cruises through their history from the early days of Bon Scott right up to their 1990 album \\"Razors Edge.\\"  To be honest, I wasn't sure if Brian Johnson could pull it off as a vocalist onstage, but he pleasantly surprised me.  Not only does his voice project well in concert, but he sings the Bon Scott songs with enough authority to almost claim them as his own.  I was really impressed with his renditions of pre-\\"Back in Black\\" material like \\"High Voltage,\\" \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" and \\"Highway to Hell.\\"  And guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young hold their own impressively on personal favorites like \\"Shoot to Thrill,\\" \\"Who Made Who,\\" and the aggressive \\"Let There Be Rock.\\"  The reason why \\"Live\\" works so well is 1) it's a fantastic performance of AC/DC and 2) it could also be a greatest hits set as the tracklisting covers the band's history pretty well.  I understand that there's a single disc version available, but don't be cheap and get that edition.  Go for the gusto and get the double disc version, which has a fourteen minute (yes, fourteen minute) live version of \\"Jailbreak\\" which is mandatory listening for any AC/DC fan.  If you're even remotely interested in this group, then \\"Live\\" should rank high on your albums to get.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Since Stephen King's novels are extremely long, the mini series format is perfect for them. Even though SOME things have to be cut out (the author was never stingy with words or overly long descriptions), but this allows the script writer and director to leave enough stuff in to allow them to follow the original story without having to make big changes in the plot line to cover up for things that had been cut out.<br />This movie has stayed pretty much loyal to the original story - even though the order of events in the book has been changed (in the movie, we first see the kids' story, then the adults', while in the book both are told stage by stage - for every stage the adults go through, we see the kids' equivalent). I thought that the book version was more effective. The cast (which included the amazing John Ritter, which passed away not that long ago) was great too.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is a must have for any Beatles fans out there. It's about the Beatles, by the Beatles. Can't get any more exact information than that... I've watched it so many times I don't think I can even count that high! It's really awesome. It has interviews, music videos, movie clips... You name it, it's in there. <BR>The last few chapters were very sad; I was in tears!
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|As a long, long, long time fan of Peter Gabriel, I must say I was a tad skeptical when I heard of this release.  But, after having these discs for 2 weeks, nothing else has been put in my CD player.  It is an unbelieveable compilation (not perfect, but what is?) that old and new fans should love.  BUY IT TODAY!!  While you're at it, buy the GROWING UP LIVE DVD, wowww!!!!!!!!!!
B00008EY9G|5.0|This is a thrilling &quot;who dunnit&quot; film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I rented it recently, but will now buy it.  It is a great addition to anyone's collection, and one you will want to see again.  It has a very exciting and unique story plot.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Ths movie isn't much like Fargo.  It's funny.  I like the Big Lebowski because it was such a funny, unpretentious movie.  I like John Goodman's character, who won't bowl on Saturday because it's Shabbas (not Jewish) and Steve Buscemi's lovable, kind-hearted victim.  I like John Turtoro's vain, egotistical diva of a bowler.  Mostly though, I liked the Dude.  I remember how much I liked Starman, but I had forgotten why I liked Jeff Bridges.  As the Dude, Bridges doesn't just deliver lines, he projects a state of being.  <BR>Plus, I like the Coen brothers zanines that the Dude as Everyman finds himself in.  S&amp;M, freaky Germans with weird Rodents, etc., etc.  See Raising Arizona for more info.  Actually, see the Big Lebowski, then see Raising Arizona.  And did I mention I like this movie?
B00008PW2D|1.0|Reading all the other reviews I have decided not to buy season 5 even though I bought all other 4 seasons. I havent seen this (5th) series but I think I can live without these 8 episodes. If the price would have been fair, I still might have considered buying it. Its a shame HBO is only trying to get as much money out of it as possible.
B00005JMFR|5.0|\\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is an brilliant finale to one of the best movie sagas in our and any time. Keanu Reeves, returns, of course, as Neo, The One and possible savior of Zion. Neo is in a coma, which, strangely, doesn't look like a coma because his brain patterns are different than a person in a coma, unfortunately. Laurence Fishburne, is, back as, Morpheus, the man with all the ideas. He believes in Neo, because of what he can do. Carrie-Anne Moss is, of course, back as, Trinity, who would give her life to save Neo. Neo is trapped between the machine world and the real world, unfortunately, by the Merovingian, played again, by Lambert Wilson. The Oracle, this time, played by Mary Alice, replacing the late Gloria Foster, is back, too. As is, Agent Smith, played, with sheer brilliance, by Hugo Weaving, who has never looked better in a performance like this, unfortunately. Niobe, played again, by Jada Pinkett Smith, is back, as well. This is also an appearance by the Architect, played again by, Helmut Bakaitis. The rest of the cast from \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" returns as well, too. This is an brilliant movie with brilliant ideas and thoughts in its brain, a little more than \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\". It doesn't have that many fight scenes as its first two processors did, unfortunately, it is brilliant, nonetheless. The score by Don Davis, is a triumph in itself and it is one of the best scores heard this year so far. The directing by The Wachowski Brothers, is superb and dynamic, but it is also brilliant, too. The Costume Design by Kym Barrett is excellent. The Production Design by Owen Patterson is wonderful without compromise. The Cinematography by Bill Pope is superb. The Film Editing by Zach Staenberg is dynamic. The Screenplay, also by, the Wachowski Brothers, is excellent and superb, without compromise. The Visual Effects is brilliant as its first two processors, and it shapes the filmmaking of tomorrow's newest talents as \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" did. Go see this movie now and try to see it again, if possible. It is a visionary achievement that shall be remembered for all time.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|this cd is amazing...just like any other Sarah cd. i have been a huge fan for years, and i think that &quot;World on Fire&quot; is definetly one of Sarah's best. I have read some reviews and seen that some people thought it was horrible, apparently they are Sarah fans, because the only thing horrible they are reading is their own comments.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I was first turned on to Sarah McLachlan in 1998 when I had been watching the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the song Full of Grace appeared on the season finale and Angel from City of Angels Soundtrack. I was hooked from the start. I already has her song I Will Remember You on a CD Compilation but I still wasn't sure I wasn't sure I wanted to buy her CD so I brought Surfacing on tape and fell in love with every song on there (and being the Buffy and Angel fan that I was, I thought her songs were so applicable to my fav TV couple). <br />And then I heard Fear on the series opener of Roswell (I thanks them for giving me Dido as well) and I was changed.<br />I went out and brought every CD of Sarah's the I could find. And I've never looked back. So when I listend to Fallen, then Push, and then Little Dirty Secret, I was blown away. Sarah had done it again. Now some say that this CD is quite repetitive, but I disagree. I think Sarah on this CD is sending out the message that stillness is not a bad thing, a bit of normalcy wouldn't hurt anyone. The tunes are haunting, classic, and sung so beautifully you just want to cry. I haven't heard a bag song from this woman yet. And don't plan to in the future.<br />You have to admit that no on stays the same forever. People change. And why should we expect anything different from our favorite performers. They too need to evolve and becomes something other than what they already are. Afterglow says it all: It talks about lows, highs, and stuff in between. And okay, so it will never be Surfacing or Fumbling... but who cares? It's worthy of five stars on in it's own right.
B00005JLET|5.0|Historically I've had a bit of a hard time digesting Japanese anime movies. At times I can't quite make what it is they're trying to convey, with a whole mithology and a world of its own that I have a hard time relating with. Therefore, though I'd only heard great things said about &quot;Spirited Away&quot; (and read about the many awards it had won) I was still worried that it'd have that I-don't-know-what that had characterized most animes I'd seen.<br />I was gladly surprised, and fortunately I was wrong. With its exquisite art direction and brilliant storyline, this animated movie falls in a category somewhere between &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The similarity to &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; is because of the fantastic elements (actually there's a dragon, not unlike the eighties' classic!), the story of a brave little kid (a girl, Chihiro, in this case) battling courageously, though is somewhat more &quot;terrestrial&quot; conditions (working hard in bathhouse to to maintain her integrity, and be able to save her parents) and the abundance of spells and magic in the story. As for the parallel I see with &quot;The Matrix&quot;, it has to do with the parallel &quot;world&quot; in which the spirits of the movie inhabit, by night: a supra-world, you might call it; one where they rule and admit no actual humans (I guess it's not the best comparison, but you get the idea... I hope!)<br />The movie as a whole is not a typical Sunday afternoon popcorn-in-the-couch flic: it is a story that departs from conventions. But it constantly rewars you with a clever and adorable storyline that is not short of funny moments. In the end, you get a very refreshing feeling deep inside. I, for one, have become very interested in Miyasaki's work. Will continue to check out his other movies.
B00009V7T2|5.0|There are some misconceptions about this CD that should be cleared up now:<br />1) While Omar and Cedric (the guitarist and lead singer, respectively) have called this a 'concept' album, please do not let this scare you off--the lyrics are so oblique and fragmented that you can ascribe whatever meaning you wish to the material.  And should you wish to follow along with the 'story'--or at least try to--more power to you.<br />2) 'Cedric and Co.': While the Mars Volta are a band, we must give credit where credit is due: Cedric Bixler is the lead vocalist and lyricist, but Omar Rodriguez is the mastermind behind the majority of the music on this CD.  Just because Cedric is the front man, let's not lose sight of who wrote most of the material: Omar.  (If you dispute this, you need only read any interview with the two--Cedric does not deny that Omar is the strongest creative force in the band.)<br />3) &quot;This doesn't sound like At the Drive-In!&quot;  Listen to the music first.  This album is a logical progression from certain songs on &quot;Relationship of Command.&quot;  I can't imagine many ATDI fans not liking this CD (although I'm sure there are some who won't).  And even if many parts don't sound like At the Drive-In... who cares?  It's not At the Drive-In.  While ATDI were (obviously) one of the greatest post-punk/hardcore bands of their (or any) time, things change... and now we have the Mars Volta.  For At the Drive-In fans, check out The Blood Brothers.  That should whet your hardcore appetite<br />4) &quot;I don't even know what to call this kind of music--it's too weird!&quot;  This is a very common misconception, perpetuated by people who have only heard the album once, or perhaps only a couple of songs; this album has HOOKS.  It has MELODIES, and, even better, CHORUSES.  Almost every single song has a singable and memorable CHORUS.  This is MUSIC.  This is not 'noise'; these are actualy songs.  Yes, the album is original, and fractured, and made up of many disparate elements (although it rarely sounds 'experimental' just for the sake of experimentation), and may take a few listens to fully appreciate, but soon you will be singing along to the choruses... just like you did with At the Drive-In.<br />Recommendations:  If you like this, please do yourself a favor and check out The Blood Brothers' &quot;Burn Piano Island, Burn,&quot; and Refused's classic &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot; -- a CD that shares artistic similarities with &quot;De-Loused,&quot; but came years before.
B00005JKED|5.0|this film was TIGHt, from start to finish, its great. Humorous at times, but intense. I watched this film over and over, i memorized the script. But this movie or atleast rent it, its worth it, I also reccomend out of time and antwone fisher
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is my favorite action movie, although it is a little bit bloody and gory, and a few guys get their heads and arms chopped off. This movie really filled a special warm spot in my heart.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|One of the hallmarks of a great album is, when reading the reviews, nearly every track on the disc is someone's favorite.    <BR>  Tull's inventiveness is perfectly restrained; their choices are smart; their execution is stellar ('Pavane'  and \\"A Winter Snowscape\\"  are both Grammy material); and it is abundantly clear that this band is having a lot of fun, which makes for a Christmas album that  is neither huge nor heavy nor ponderous, but rather lifts you to a real holiday mood; the kind where you're truly in Tull's magical Christmas Album scene from the days of yore.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Before i saw this movie i thought it was going to be the stupidest moovee ever, i thought it wuz gunna really suk. After i saw it that all changed, it was so funny, i was laghing so hard i had to change my pants about sever times. this movie is filled with the best stupid humor ever, even better and more stupid than dumb and dumber. if you are one of those people that doesn't watch funny movies, u better make an exeption for this one. this movie really moved me, it filled a very special playce in my heart.the best line in the movie changed my life fore ever, that line was the only line i said in 14 months untill my brother beat me in the head with a fish untill i forgot the line. THIS MOOVEE WUZ A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!!
6305127638|5.0|(...) I liked Star Trek First Contact and it's one of the best things Star Trek has ever done.<br />First Contact is the continuing adventures of the crew of the Enterprise from TNG series. The crew must go back in time and stop the cybernetic species The Borg. The Borg are trying to stop Zepryham Cochran. The man who developed warp drive and established first contact. If stoped it could be catostrophic to the futre of the Enterprise and of the federation.<br />The cast from The Next Generation is fantastic. They all had there specific talents that added to the show. They all shine in First Contact.<br />Patrick Stewart is great. He is one of the most underrated actors of all-time. He is a former Shakesperian actor and he can flat out act. He wasn't always given the best work in Star Trek and this is some of his finest work he has ever done.<br />Jonathan Frakes is great. Not only does he continue his role as Cmdr. Riker but he directed the film. He uses the suspense and unkown of the Borg well. He really does add to there race with what he does with them in the movie. He's funny as Riker and is less of the playboy that Riker is in the show.<br />Brent Spiner is great as well. It's a shame he hasn't done a lot more out of Star Trek. He really gets into his characters well and plays them well. Data is one of the most beloved characters in Star Trek and the film really shows why.<br />Levar Burton has a great role in the film. He plays Geordi well in what has become his signature role. He's argueably the most successful man ouside of Star Trek with his role on Reading Rainbow and from the hit mini series Roots. It's great to see Geordi without that stupid visor he had the show. I love his optical implants.<br />I love the score Jerry Goldsmith wrote for this film. I think it's the best work he's ever done. I think it got jipped at the Oscars. The woodwind and horns are beautiful in the theme. If your a classical music fan you should love the score.<br />Star Trek FistContact is one of the best Star Trek films ever made. Fans outside of Star Trek should like it. You don't have to be a trekkie to understand the film which really helps it a lot. It's a must for anybody that calls themself a Trekkie and I think all Sci-Fi fans should see it. It's a great movie that will do what movies are suppose to do: Teach us a lesson and Entertain us.
055357342X|5.0|The third installment in &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; proves once again that George R.R. Martin is not only a master of his craft, but that he can constistantly provide an intrigueing story that breaks through the cliche of modern fantasy.  Characters such as Tyrion Lannister and Lord Stannis are fleshed out in gray terms, not the stereotypical black and white of mainstream books.  The plot is suspenseful and surprising, never leaving you where you'd expect.  I've reccomended this series to numerous friends, all of whom recognized it for the achievement that it is.  Don't miss out!
0790729652|5.0|I love comics. They were something that were introduced to me at an early age. I never bought to many because I wasn't able to afford to. Nevertheless I did read them in any way I could. Batman is a well made movie based off a comic book.<br />Batman is the story of Bruce Wayne. Bruce is a billionaire buisness man by day and the dark knight by night. He lives in Gotham city which is plagued by crime. Jack Napier is a criminal. He's a gangster who is cheating on his boss with his girl and in business. His boss knows and sets Jack up. Jack ends up in a vat of chemicals that change him into the criminal Joker. Vicki Vail is the hot vixen reporter that wants to know the truth about Batman. She ends up geting involved with Bruce and the Joker falls for her as well. Will Batman keep the girl and stop the bad guy, you'll just have to watch the movie and find out.<br />Michael Keaton was a surprise as Batman. Like I said earlier I've read a lot of comic book and I wasn't sure if Keaton could carry the darkness of Batman. He does it very well and I think you can argue him as the best Batman. The expectations as Batman are huge and he lives up to them. His performance won't leave you disappointed, but is adequate.<br />Jack Nicholson steals the movie. He is such an awesome actor and is one of the better ones to ever grace the screen. The Joker is a crazy character and Jack is crazy. I think it's a role he was born to play and I can't see anybody except for maybe Jim Carrey doing as good as a job as the Joker. The Joker in my opinion is the greatest on screen villian from a comic book ever. Jack Nicholson does that good of a job.<br />Kim Bassinger is great. She is totally hot and plays Vicki Vail well. She plays off the other actors well. She is also believable as a photograher and the writers and directors deserve credit for that. She is so hot and I can watch the movie for her alone.<br />Tim Burton deservesa a lot of credit for this movie. He displays the world of Gotham well. From the tall buildings, the darkness, the politicians, everything is just done well. I think it's one of the best movies he has ever done.<br />Danny Elfman has written a fantastic score. It's the best work he has ever done. It rivals a John Williams score and accents the movie so well. This is one of the best and catchiest scores you will ever hear.<br />I love Batman. It's one of the best comic book movies ever made. If your a comic book fan this one is a must. If your a Batman fan it is a definite must. Everyone should own this movie. It's a great film.ell.

B00006LLNU|5.0|I had my doubts about this CD since I bought it without much expectactions. But as it started playing I knew this was going to be hot. You have to be able to appreciate music without lyrics and this album does a great job. It starts off slow and builds up its pace and gets faster and more involving. There are some classic on this album like track 3 which I could play over and over again, and perhaps track 4 which has that incredible piano part on it that I wish I could learn how to play.<BR>If you enjoy new age, ambient stuff or good music in general then this should be a part of your CD collection.
6305127689|5.0|I have to admit I love Top Gun. I'm a young man that is considering the military and I was a military kid growing up. This isn't the best or most realistic military movie ever made, but it' one of the funniest.<br />Maverick(Tom Cruise) and his navigator Goose(Anthony Edwards) get the Navy pilots dream, a chance to go to Top Gun. It's at Top Gun that Maverick falls for one of his instructors Charly.(Kelly McGillis)Also at Top Gun Maverick is battling for the honor of top pilot against IceMan(Val Kilmer) Will Maverick stop being so cocky and fly like to his potential. Will he keep the girl? You'll just have to watch the movie.<br />Tom Cruise is fantastic. He does an awesome job playing Maverick. I've had the chance to spend a lot of time around pilots, and so many are like his character. This movie reminds me a lot of being with my dad on the base. Pilots are full of so much b.s. and are such hot shots. Cruise displays it on screen perfectly.<br />Anthony Edwards is great also. Goose is one of my all-time favorite movie characters. He's so loveable and goofy. A lot of pilots and navigators are like him too. I hate what happens to him in the movie, and I must admit it is hard to fight the tears.<br />Kelly McGillis is hot. She is beautiful in the movie. Her carear would have been so much better if she had kept herself looking the way she did in this movie. I like'd her charcter Charly. She does a good job.<br />I liked Val Kilmer. He plays the nemisis pilot great. He plays the macho b.s. pilot hotshot well. His charcter is a little more believable than Cruise's, but not nearly as fun. It's one of Val's better movies.<br />Top Gun is a fantastic movie. I've never met anyone that didn't like it. It's got an all-star cast, great comedey, great one liners, a fantastic soundtrack, action, romance, and much more. A great family film. A great guy film. Some people have even called it a chick flick before. You'll have fun with Top Gun.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am the type of person who does not own an album unless I can play and enjoy all if not most of the songs.  I don't know what goth is, I don't own any Linkin Park album, I have only heard that &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; song about 3 times before I bought the album and I thought that single was just another easy-to-get-sick-of one-hit-wonder heavy metal song with rapping.  I LOVE THIS ALBUM FOR ALL THE OTHER SONGS.  This is a beautifully produced album, and if they cannot play these complex songs live, I don't care because the the CD still kicks ass.  They have a choir, an orchestra, heavy metal guitar rifts, a piano, and a woman's mesermizing voice melding everything into a perfectly blended sound.  Other than the two simple and heartfelt piano solos, the songs are hard, loud, and enchanting candy to mind.  Many of these songs I just want to crank up, fill my soul, and meditate to the perfect blend of sound.  I am sure I will be keeping it in my super-selective mass collection of great albums for a long long time.  ITS A GREAT FIND AND WORTH EVERY PENNY.
B00000JGHS|3.0|First of all what I dont understand is the bad reviews I have been reading. Some seem to be pretty irate about this film. Looking at the dates of the reviews, 1999-2003,this movie was released in 1996 and had been on cable and later on free tv,yet it seems like these people lived in a box and then decided to get out and buy it. I'll admit that I have bought this film because I think Demi is hot. For the irate people, do us all a favor and watch a movie before you buy it . Would you buy a car without test driving it?
B00005AQGH|4.0|2pac Hardcore fans don't mad at me because I don't give it 5 stars!<BR>I think people is kinda overrated this album because it have some clue/maze of suspicion about 2pac death, make someone still believe pac still alive, he'll be back some day!<br />Lyrically, 2pac is one of the best rapper, fo sho' !<BR>but those beat in this album not really all is good, I tell y'all later!<br />after a Ill intro which offends about nearly all best rapper from N.Y.!<BR>this album first song \\"Bomb First\\" is a GREAT DISS song,<BR>I love pac when he makin' diss song actually!<br />\\"Hail Mary\\" is anothe Pac's Classic song, with that really really creepy and mystic Music Video!<br />\\"Toss It Up\\" it's a quite Pop song in this album, featuring couple R&B singer, they singin' too much in this song, people sayin' the first verse pac is talk about woman, and verse 2 is a Dr. Dre Diss,...it's still a great song!<br />\\"To Live & Die in LA\\" what can I say about this song...

6305922756|5.0|This is the first movie that showed to me that Christopher Guest-- and all of his players-- are great. This movie could be watched a gazillion times and still be funny. It's one of only a few DVDs in my collection, and it's one of my most prized.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Allright, I know that this is just a little girl CD, but it is way good!!  Turn off your computer and buy it!!
B00005JM02|5.0|Wonderful movie for both young and old. I really enjoyed it.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This movie had incredible script, grate fight secuences, deep meanings, philosophy, amazing special effects and what I believe was the best way to end the series. Its better than Reloded and has so much to analyze and talk about that someone has to see it more than twice to really get it. In the end it creats controversy which leads to a good profound conversation. This is one of the best movies I've seen.
B00009V7P8|3.0|This album should be applauded for it's faithfulness to Damien Rice's live sound, which has been responsible for most of the positive press coverage he has received of late. I couldn't beleive it when I heard that he produced it himself... a very professional job.  After listening to the first 3 tracks you know that you are listening to exceptional live performers who rely solely on their sound to produce a captivating atmosphere, rather than an overly well crafted studio effort, with effects and overdubs galore.  I gave the 3 stars, however, becasue the album does have one big draw back.  Rice's songs aren't very catchy, and as such I found them instantly forgettable.  True, if you read the lyric in the sleevenotes you could say that they have a poetic style which is not seen much these days, and his guitar playing and  vocals gel together seamlessly, but in the end the songwriting just lets them down.  They are good songs... but Rice's performance ability needs him to write just a couple of classic tracks before he will be able to do justice to his own talent.<br />On the plus side, I do listen to bits of this album everyday (for the past 3 weeks) and I'm not bored of it yet.
B00005JMFR|4.0|The final installment in the Matrix trilogy has disappointed some, but entertained many.  There is no doubt that the film has a different feel than the other two, but if you have watched the first two movies I cant imagine skipping the third.  The story in Revolutions comes down to two big battles: The defense of Zion against the machines and the final confrontation of Neo and the Smith program.  To that end, this is more of an action picture than the other two.  The film picks up at the precise moment that Reloaded left off.  There is no recap of the first two so if it has been a while since you have seen them I suggest watching them again before seeing Revolutions.  Unlike the first two movies, little time is spent in the Matrix.  Most of the time that is spent in the Matrix is done early in the film.  Fortunately it is quality time as it takes place at a party in Merovingin's club (and this guy knows how to party!).  I wish more time had been allotted to this character (Merovingin) and Persephone.  Most of the rest of the Matrix time is with the Oracle until the final Neo/Smith battle.  We are given a descent explanation why the Oracle looks different (the original actress passed away before filming was complete).  <br />From here the movie splits time between the battle at Zion and the epic battle between Neo and Smith.  <BR>The battle between the sentinels and the Zion APUs is like watching a giant video game.  It is visually fantastic and quite well done.  More screen time is given to Smith (Hugo Weaving) and is welcome.  He has some great dialog and his character is interesting and colorful.  The Trinity/Neo relationship is not as prominent (thank goodness).  However, the worse scene in the film and for me the only  real disappointment comes at the expense of Trinity (I dont want to spoil anything.  Suffice it to say you will know what I mean).  In the end, the film wraps up the trilogy fairly well.  Many questions are answered, but some things are left for interpretation.  There is still plenty of religious symbolism, but most of the philosophical babbling is gone, replaced by all out action.<br />This is a movie that just has to be seen on the big screen.  The epic battles look awesome and the sound is fantastic.  Go to a theater with a good sound system.  The bass will vibrate throughout your body.  I look forward to seeing the movie again on IMAX.  I suspect that like Reloaded, I will enjoy it even more the second time around.
0393038912|2.0|It is very frustrating to give this book 2 stars because it deserves more.  The concept and scope of the book is fascinating, however, the execution leave much to be desired.  In talking with several people about this book we all came to the same conclusion, the book is too long.  Diamond repeatedly brings up interesting points and then repeatedly beats them into the ground.  A neat idea that can be covered in 3 pages, instead takes 15.  After the first 100 pages yout get what he is talking about, but there is still another 300 pages to go.  Unfortunately I can't recommend this book to anyone, because it is too painful to read.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love this album! I can't see any of them being big hits on the radio BUT then again, Sarah isn't a mindless bubble-gum chomping, skin-flashing pop queen.<br />Each song on this album is very good. I know it'll be one of my favorite albums played over &amp; over. The best way I can describe this album is this: I can't wait to play it in the middle of the night while watching the snow fall, enjoying a glass of good wine.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I really liked the movie. Selene is a 'death dealer', a vampire trained to kill werewolves. Vampires and werewolves have been at bitter war for centuries, each determined to drive the other to extinction. Now, the werewolves may have an edge as they discovered a way to combine the genes of both species to create a half-vampire, half-werewolf breed with strengths of both and none of their weaknesses. It all hinges on a human doctor, to whom Selene feels forbidden attraction, especially since he'll soon turn into a werewolf himself. The storyline was very tight, gradually revealing how the war began and not everyone is as he/she seems. The action sequences were amazing. The movie seems to have focused on building to story, perhaps leaving the personal drama and romance to the sequel which is in works. I'm looking forward to it.
B00005JM02|3.0|This is solely in reference to the actual DVD release, and more specifically, to a certain technical issue.  I won't go into the actual movie, as I generally agree with all the great things said about this wonderful piece of entertainment.  My bone to pick is with something that has come up on numerous DVD's...<br />On some DVD players, you may notice some instances when particular parts of the image, mainly the bright red Marlin character, looks a bit jagged or 'blippy'.  We're talking about a blink of an eye here or there (one frame - 1/30th of a second, actually, but in several places in the film).  Most noticeably, the scene with the sea turtles when the young turtles pile up on Marlin.  If you go frame-by-frame, you'll notice some pixelization here and there.  I tried three different Nemo DVD's on my new Pioneer DV-563AS player, in both progressive-scan and standard, through both component and s-video output, and the anomalies were still there.  Strangely, I did not see this on an older Sony unit that I have.  Additionally, there seems to be a surprising amount of grain in the picture for a digital-to-digital transfer.  I can only determine this to be less than optimal DVD encoding as performed by the factory.<br />I think a good benchmark for DVD picture quality (especially with a progressive-scan to HDTV set-up like mine) is Pixar's Toy Story 2, especially the opening sequence.  This is an overall pristine DVD with the utmost clarity and picture integrity.  I've also heard of some problems with Monsters Inc., but watched that DVD again very closely and noticed no such issues as with Nemo.<br />So.... there's a good chance that many viewers (especially those with standard TV set-ups) will not notice this.  And perhaps the Pioneer player is the only one that will show this (as the Sony did not, although my Sony player is 5 years old).  But since the other DVD's mentioned play cleanly, and since I haven't noticed any such thing's with any other of my many DVD's,I'm behooved to lay blame on the DVD encoding.  I kinda' hope it's just my player, as I'd like to believe that DVD encoding quality is on the way up.  But in reading through many DVD-rating sites, this kind of DVD encoding problem is more common than it should be.....especially on such a movie that should take advantage of newer home entertainment technology.
0156027321|5.0|I have read so many books this past year, and here is one that did not let me down, from the very beginning, until it's end.  Not only was the story incredibly imaginative, it was thought provoking and just plain enjoyable to read, a real adventure.  I also learned things I didn't know, not only about survival, but also animal behavior.<BR>I plan on recommending this to my reading group, next time we meet!
B00005JLK1|2.0|The very first sequence in GHOSTSHIP is one of the most gruesome scenes in recent memory. (Director Steve Beck previously used similar gruesome scenes in his remake of THIRTEEN GHOSTS.) This is a high concept (yet poor in execution) film taking the haunted house premise to an ocean liner. Yet this is still not anything new and  the film manages a little originality in its plot with a couple of decent twists and surprises. The story focuses on a salvage team on board the 'Arctic Warrior'  They are approached by a pilot from the Canadian Air Force who claims he has spotted a ship adrift in Alaskan waters. They set out to find the ship. Julianna Margulies of tv's ER is cast almost in the same vain as Sigourney Weaver's character (Ripley) in ALIEN and Gabriel Byrne as Captain Murphy somehow ends up as a support character once the story shifts to the the haunted oceanliner; 'The Antonia Graza'. Then the story and frights shifts to predictability as each cast member gets picked off one by one by the strange disturbances of the haunted ship and the audience is subjected to a few more gruesome scenes brought on by ghosts. The production values, sets, and casting ,are first rate. However,  the script is weak and all the characters are generic.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Can someone tell me where all the original and amazing art has gone because we need to get it back!!  Two days before being stunned by the mediocracy of this cd, I sat stunned by the droning 3rd Matrix movie.  So much potential from both Sarah M. (Fumbling Towards Ectasy) and the Wachowski bros. (Matrix 1) and such milquetoast!  I preordered the latest Sarah M. cd because I love her work so much.  Unfortunately this cd all sounds the same, with no distinctness anywhere except Fallen and Answer.  The rest of the songs don't evoke any feelings other than mourning for the original, evocative art that Sarah M. is beyond capable of.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I read some reviews of Revolutions prior to seeing it last weekend and then decided that, for my own sake, I should stop so that I would not let the close-minded opinions of others cloud my own. Everyone is griping about how it was terrible and how they expected so much more.  What else did you expect?  Revolutions was incredible.  Great action.  High emotions.  And thought provoking.  I guess most people want all of the answers at the end of the movie without having to think and discuss and use the \\"muscle that really matters\\".  <BR>Revolutions is amazing and an awesome end to the trilogy.<BR>Just a quick note for those who say Reloaded had a weak plot/story to it; were we watching the same movie?  Reloaded was non-stop with a story from the opening scene.  And another thing for those who say the acting is bad;have you ever tried it?  Keanu is awesome.  Revolutions is the best movie of the year(tied with Reloaded of course).
B000067JG3|5.0|I LOVE THE SOUND OF MUSIC! I'm not just saying this because I love to sing and all that kind of stuff, but I love the story, the energy that the actors put forth, especially Julie Andrews. My favorite parts of the movie include the great songs by the great composers. If you already like musicals, you should definitely see The Sound of Music and you'll fall in love with it! The kids made me laugh with this slick wit, well what they thought was slick. Anyway, the whole movie is great. If you ever get a chance to see the play, do that, too!
0671027344|5.0|Looking through the reviews I am baffled as to why some people hated this book. Sure Charlie's character was odd, nieve, and emotional, but he was also genuinly nice and caring, all of these things make him all the more endearing. He is unique and I really do truly think he made me change my outlook on life. Sam and Patrick are the friends you wish you had, and I find myself laughing aloud at Mary-Elizebeth's character. It is an excellent book for any age because I think everyone can remeber growing up scared and confused like Charlie. This book also introduced me to some truly beautiful music and literature. Though it was a quick read i'm sure you will find yourself reading it over and over.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|when i first saw a picture of these guys, i immediatly thought &quot;ok, trying a little too hard to be 'gothic' and 'dark'&quot; but then i heard the song 'remenissions' on my music chioce channel on direct tv....i immediatly started listening to more of their stuff and came to the conclusion...&quot;these are the greatest guitars i have heard in the longest time...they are my new favorite band&quot;, they say that they are hardcore punk..but all i hear is the most beautiful melodic/old school metal...please do yourselves the favor and buy (or steal) this album as soon as possible.
B00005JM02|5.0|This was a fun ride!!  Through out the movie, we are on an adventure and we are generally interested in seeing characters suceeding.  The story line of this movie reminds me of Disney's other classic, Bambi.  Through tragedy comes acceptance.  This was a beautifully crafted, well made movie that will become a classic in years to come.<br />Note: The first 5 minutes of this film could be very traumatic for children under 6 as I experienced with my three little cousins who were crying hysterically in the movie theatre at the sudden loss of a loved one.  BEWARE!!
0385720920|5.0|<BR>Ive read \\"Survivor\\", \\"Choke\\", \\"Fight Club\\", \\"Lullaby\\", and \\"Invisible Monsters.\\". Choke was by far the best. Dont be surprised if you see this on the big screen. <br />To write the review the would have helped me... \\"Choke\\" was better than his other books, for serious! <br />\\"In Palahniuk we trust\\"
0140182829|5.0|This classic story is famous for its addictive eerie atmosphere -it deals with the protaganist stumbling upon, by chance, of a magical castle in the midst of a wild forest, and what happens there, and the impossible attempt to find it again.  The story should really not be spoiled.  But if the idea intrigues you, check this one out.  Other books somewhat like it, in the sense of having a magical atmosphere that draws you in, include Bulgakov's the Master and Margarita and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows.<br />This classic translation by Briton Frank Davison has been around in Penguins for many years, and has been read by thousands of readers who fell in love with the story because of its fine literary English.  The reviewer below who complains it is old and not &quot;American&quot; enough in its slang has missed this point.  The best translations don't need to be changed, even if the TV-computer games generation can't handle it.  For example, the Master and Margarita, beautifully translated by Mirra Ginsburg in the Grove Press edition, was later ruined by another translation purposely wrought into modern American slangy English.  But both the Grand Meaulnes and Master need the good Queen's English which their grand tales demand.  Read the classic Penguin translation here and see why.
B00005JMFR|4.0|In a nutshell, the best way to describe Revolutions is: Matrix 1, inverted! Just think of how and where the action was staged in The Matrix and flip it completely. <BR>Just when you think that you have never seen a sci-fi fight scene this grandiose, the Wachowskis kick it up one very fat notch,(I'm not talking about the end-game sequence here either). There is more psycho-babble, every bit as vague/simple as Reloaded, but if I don't walk away from a sci-fi flick without feeling at least a bit dorky, then I'm just not getting my moneys worth!<BR>Technology is used for no practical purpose, in needlessly dangerous ways, by people who say things to each other in convoluted parables which just makes it harder for Keanu, who is struggling to keep up anyway...and I guarantee you'll love every minute of it.<BR>There are even parts where you just want to yell out to characters to (metaphysically) watch out behind themselves...and they never do. Great fun!<BR>The most cynical criticism has been leveled at the conclusion of the film, but in yet another great sci-fi tradition, the end matters not one over-ripe fig. It's the ride we're along for here folks, and to knock the Matrix for trying too hard is like getting frustrated with a forest because of all the damn trees.<BR>Matrix Revolutions, you'll cry, you'll laugh, (both in all the wrong places),but you'll still be talking about it long after the credits roll.
0060977493|5.0|Arundhati Roy's first novel, The God of Small Things, is a fine exercise of storytelling and style.  The general structure of the tale (sequence of narrative, etc.) is actually a bit like the late Douglas Adams.  The events described are not told in chronological order.  There does not seem to be a plan for the novel through much of it.  And when it seems that the plot cannot become any more convoluted, everything starts dropping into place.  Of course, in Adams' works the curtain drops to reveal hysterical punchlines of some immensely entertaining wisdom-ish type.  Roy's novel is not meant to betray a comic sentiment in the end, although there are moments of sheer joy in the novel.  When everything coagulates in her book, a tragedy unfolds of relatively gigantic proportions.   There is a sadness, helplessness, and resignation present in the novel that presents quite starkly the plight of many Indians, not just the fictional ones found between the pages here.<BR> The God of Small Things reveals the dignity of downtrodden characters and the underdogs while scouring the abusive caste/class system that in much of India (and really, in much of the world) refuses to die.  The characters, both upper and lower caste, who seek to preserve their arbitrary social status by whatever means they can find are given the rough treatment warranted while the transgressors of societal norms are revealed in their beauty, all flaws included.  The prose is constructed in way perfectly suited to the story.  What appear almost to be whimsical flights of fancy for the pen turn out to be the very substance of the novel upon which all the character development rests.  Be it Rahel &amp; Estha's penchant for reading things backwards (eB ti lehaR &amp; s;athsE tnahcnep rof gnidaer sdrawkcab) or the peculiarities of Chacko's different voices, all the exercises in random reveal insight into the characters and their perspective of the events described.<BR> For about twenty pages late in the book the story seemed to drag a bit before revving up again for the finale.  Given how much I enjoyed the rest of the novel, I'm apt to chalk that up to having read it in one long sitting and not some fault of the author's.  This is indubitably one of the finest novels I've read.  The characters are enjoyable, alternately vivid or gray depending on what Ms. Roy has decided to paint them as.  The prose is alive and inventive.  The story is compelling and very moving.  The book is, in short, a masterpiece.
B00008X5J3|1.0|Just could not stand watching this movie.  Actually there is no movie, it has too simple of a story with only about 10 to 15 minutes of dialogue, the rest of the time is halfas*ed musical scenes.  Truly a waste of money.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I don't understand why some goofs are rushing to pan this film. Is it now cool to hate these movies? That must be the reason. It's not because this film is bad because it was great.<br />I loved this film: it's philosophy, the cinematography and the great action scenes. I went to see this movie with two other people, when it was over they both agreed that the movie was great and the critics are crazy!<br />The fight scene at the end was phenomenal, well worth the price of the ticket and the battle for Zion scene was exceptionally good. This film kicked major a$$!!<br />So why all the bad reviews? Who knows.. The Wachowski brothers have managed to turn The Matrix from a pure action film series into a credible work of science fiction, and I guess that made things too complicated for some people. <br />Anyway, follow the philosophy of the movie: think for yourself. if you want to go see the movie, then go see it.
014028902X|5.0|Author Gerald Durrell continues his fascination with animals in \\"My Family and Other Animals.\\"  The true, personal narrative discusses the adventures that take place as ten-year old Gerald finds a family of scorpions in a plaster wall.  The settings are full of frenzy as Durell becomes captivated with his new friends.  The series of events show a typical family's response to the antics of the \\"Dennis the Menace\\" in the family.<BR> As the story proceeds, Gerald is ripping sections of plaster away from a decaying wall in order to capture his new-found friends.  Finding a female scorpion with masses of babies clinging to her, the young boy decides to give them a new home.  He sneaks the arachnids into his family's home by means of a matchbox.  As the  twenty-three year old brother, Larry, starts to light up a cigarette, the story becomes explosive.  Even though the female scorpion means no harm, she hoists herself up and scuttles onto the back of Larry's hand as he slides open the matchbox.  His scream of horror terrifies Lugaretzia, the maid, and she drops a plate, which in turn brings Roger, the family's black woolly dog, out from under the table.  Larry flicks the enemy between Margo and Leslie, Gerald's older sister and brother.  Margo swirls a glass of water towards the scorpion, but instead drenches Mother.  In a comical sequence, the Durrell family exchanges a series of terrified comments.<BR> \\"Look out! Look out! They're coming!\\"<BR> \\"Quick...quick...do something!\\"<BR> \\"Look out...there's another one!\\"<BR> In the mean time, Roger the dog assumes the family is being threatened.  Since Lugaretzia is the only stranger in the room, he feels it is his responsibility to attack.  And, so, she receives a nice bite to the ankle.  As the story draws to an end, the pandemonium stops, and the family retires to the drawing room.  Gerald conjures up all his spider friends and take them on a one-way flight to the garden wall. The only repercussion for the ten-year old comes from Mother as she procees to update his education by means of the belt.  The author's purpose to enact an entertaining event in the lives of the Durrells is met.<BR> The author moves form character to character in a spordic chain of events.  What begins as a typical evening at home with the whole family ends in a total uproar in the household.  The scenes definitely show the expressiveness Durrell is trying to present.  From one character to another, each action produces a reaction. The auther presents great visual imagery concerning the chaotic nature of the whole affair.  The personal narrative being told by Gerald, the ten-year old, adds an additional amount of humor.<BR> Durrell does an exceptional job in depicting a typical family and its struggles to survive.  The character portrayed by Gerald shows the immense imagination and curiousity that most children of that age have.  Gerald's nature of learning and growing could be overlooked by the reader, but a lot has to be said about his meantality.  He discovers scorpions like to eat bluebottles, grasshoppers, moths, and lacewing flies.  He even notices one scorpion eating another!  At night he takes a flashlight and  delves into the walls of plaster and catches the scorpions in their sexual acts.  Mother fails to see that the best education Gerald is receiving is the one about life.<BR> The results of the events were many.  Brother Larry developes a phobia about matchboxes.  Lugaretzia walks with a limp due to the dog bite.  Margo and Leslie wants to slaughter the whole batch of baby scorpions, but Mother allows me to release them in the garden.  The author uses lively verbs and comical sequences in allowing the reader to enjoy the confusion of the Durrell family.  My personal views on \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" include a pronounced invitation for others to read and enjoy its contents.
B000009EAD|3.0|Now, this being the only Iced Earth record I own, I don't have much to compare it to. It sounds to me like good old school progressive metal. A lot of the songs on this one will take you back to the days of old school prog metal/rock bands like Rush or Iron Maiden, but with more of a fantasy type direction, just not a full-on Blind Guardian type direction. Most of this album sounds raw, but not punk raw. It's true heavy metal type raw. This sound is mostly due to the production, though. <BR>The album kicks off well and stays very well from tracks 1-9. I like how the album seems to go from fast hard songs to a more ballad type and switches off like this mostly throughout the whole record. Most especially the track 9 instrumental &quot;1776,&quot; which alone warrents the purchase of this album, and is undoubtably one of the greatest metal instrumentals of all time! After track 9 though is where I feel the album starts to slip a bit.<BR>Track 10 is good, but feels somewhat too simplistic. I can listen to it, but not everytime, just once in a while. Tracks 11 and 12 didn't really get me off my feet either. I tend to skip these. Track 13 is where the album picks up again though, and even though the song as a whole would probably be a 3out of 5, there are some great moments in it; like the nice piano into and the chorus chanting in the middle and end of the song. This is the only song which has a fantasy type sound to the likes of Blind Guardian. <BR>Now usually, if I was to enjoy about 3 quarters of a record, I usually would give it 4 stars, but the only reason I went a step down with this one is its simplicity in guitar playing. I'm not saying these guys can't play, sure they are much better musicians than most of the idiot nu metal bands plaguing the airwaves. Still, after hearing such great guitar work from bands like Symphony X, Blind Guardian and Opeth, these guys would rank bottom. Impressive solo's are seldom, and most songs consist of easy power chords. Most ofthe acoustic ballads also consist only of easy bar chords (nowhere near the genius of Opeth acoustics). Now, don't let this deter you, even though the guitar work itself is rather simplistic as a whole, the songs themselves are still very good. Hell, Metallica's guitar work isn't very impressive (sure Kirk Hammet can rip on solo's), most of their stuff consists of easy power chords, too, just more thrash like - but still, the songs themselves were great. <BR>I definitely recommend a purchase if you want to get into these guys, but I'd suggest giving more than 1 spin on the cd player before you judge it. If you're into old school stuff, you'll probably love it.
B0000AFX64|3.0|this is a rebuttal of sorts....<br />For the record, BG was planned as a TV miniseries in 1977-78, and was shot in standard TV format, meaning full frame aspect ratio of 1.33:1. However, the show had cost more than expected, and so it was decided to release a edited version to theaters in canada and probably overseas.  In order to do this, they reprinted the film with the top and bottom portions masked off to adapt to then-current movie projectors.  Then, as now, practically every theater was setup to screen films in either 1.85:1 or 2.35:1.  So this version is a representation of BG that was sent to theaters in 1978<BR>(As for this DVD being without anamorphic enhancement, that's just Universal being cheap and seeing a chance to exploit BG fandom by double-dipping. Although I don't know how many takers they will get because they included a promo for the SciFi Channel's &quot;reimagining&quot; Of Battlestar Galactica....something that dedicated Galactica fans HATE!!!)
B00005JLWN|5.0|I loved this movie. I think this movie and it's star (soon to be Batman - Christian Bale) are highly underated. It didn't do so well in the box office, probably because of poor marketing (I only saw one commercial for it prior to it's release and never even new when it came out. I would have never seen it if I hadn't come across it in the video store). Pay no attention to the review above in which Pavel Simsa complains that there is not enough realism in this movie. Sure, there are some unrealistic scenes in the movie, but hey, I've got a news flash for you Pavel - IT'S ONLY A MOVIE! and a SCI/FI movie at that. Sci/Fi movies are supposed to be unrealistic. If you want realism, go rent Steel Magnolias or something. So relax and enjoy. Bottom line - If you liked The Matrix, and you're not one of these people who sits there through the whole movie picking it apart saying &quot;That would never happen&quot;, you'll love this movie. Lots of action, a good storyline, and a great cast. I've added it to my DVD collection and once you've watched it, I'm sure you'll do the same. Pay no attention to the editorial above either. I liked the gun katas and I happen to think that the fight scene over the puppy was awesome! Who wouldn't fight someone that was trying to kill a puppy dog?
B000003TA4|1.0|If you ask me, I think we need to counteract this agnst-rock &quot;revolution&quot; that Nirvana have bore. Please... just take a gander at the cr@p they've spawned... ahem, I mean &quot;inspired&quot;. Pearl Jam. Green Day. Bush. Marilyn Manson. Smile Empty Soul. It's all apathetic, careless, thoughtless, and downright souless. What do bands like Green Day and Smile Empty Soul have to whine about?! Come to think of it, what'd Cobain ever have to whine about? So he was smacked around a few times by some Aberdonian hicks in grade school. 95% of kids go through worse than that. At least Cobain had looks. MTV just force-fed and pre-packaged &quot;alternative&quot; rock for snotty rich kids who thought not having a ride to the mall was hell. I don't care what it takes, bring back adult contemporary if it's necessary, but truth be told, agnst-rock is not getting anyone anywhere by teaching kids to be smart-azzed, intolerant schitts. Real rock in the alternative vein teaches kids to question authority in an intelligent way when needbe, and not to spout off hate at the nearest concept/type of human being they're too think to understand. Nirvana is stale. For all Kurt Cobain's hype, the world truly deserved something better than what he gave us. And that's all he was... He was just a glamourized peice of shiype.
B00005JLKB|5.0|this is the most badest show ever made like it's good.
6302800927|5.0|I think the movie, Stand By Me, is an excellent movie.  It's excellent because it contains some things a movie should.  It contains friendship, adventure, life, drama, and heart.<BR>This movie is about of course 4 friends who come of age in the summer in the 1950s.  In this movie, I think you learn a thing or two about what really matters and how things can change.  The ending is good, but I thought it was a little sad.  I understand that this is a coming of age movie, but usually coming of age movies and books usually have a factor which changes and new things come about from this.<BR>This movie was wonderfully made.  So see Stand By Me, and you'll see what I mean!
B00003CXB4|3.0|My husband and I popped this into the DVD player to watch one night when we wanted something friendly and comforting. The intro sequence with Zazu (minus his proper voice) was dull and endless, but we were most horrified to reach the scene with Simba's pouncing lesson to find a hideously extended version. We literally had to stop the DVD, it was so bad. We realized at this point that Disney had allowed the selection on this DVD to default to their new special edition. Hey Disney folks--if we want to see crappy extras, we'll go watch the special features.<BR>If the regular cinema version hadn't been on this DVD, I would have returned it in a heartbeat.
B00005JM02|4.0|This movie begins with a tragedy (like Bambi and The Lion King).<BR>It also includes physical deformity (like Dumbo with his big ears).  You would think that they could come up with a storyline that didn't include whiping out the entire family.<BR>Once I &quot;got over it&quot; I enjoyed the rest of the movie.  The animation was wonderful.
B00009TB5G|4.0|First things first: This extended version of The Two Towers is a superior stand-alone film and a superior adaptation of Tolkien than it's theatrical cousin.   Unfortunately, TTT SEE still does not reach the bar set by Fellowship of the Ring in either of these categories.  Fellowship of the Ring (both Theatrical and Extended) was a truly fantastic accomplishment because it worked brilliantly as a stand-alone film and it worked brilliantly as an adaptation of Tolkien's masterwork.  Peter Jackson did something amazing.  He met my huge expectations in both of these categories.  After FOTR, my expectations for The Two Towers were even loftier.  Sadly, even with the superior extended edition, TTT fails to meet my expectations.  In my opinion, the filmmakers got a little cocky, a little too creative and began to tinker with the story in places that did not need tinkering.  The end result:  Two Towers, even in this extended version, does not reflect the brilliance of the book in the way that FOTR did.<br />That being said, this new version of the film is still very good.  The added scenes do much to flesh out the newly introduced characters (Treebeard, Eowyn and Faramir especially).  The new scenes add Tolkien dialogue (always appreciated).  They make the story feel more epic, giving a greater sense of depth and history to Middle Earth (Numenor, entwives, Dunedein are all mentioned).  However, several of the new scenes contain (what I would consider to be) misplaced humor.  If you had significant problems with the theatrical cut (non-Tolkien characterization of Theoden, time wasted with Arwen/Aragorn, Merry/Pippin tricking the ents into launching their assault on Isengard, Elves at Helm's Deep, Frodo taken to Osgiliath, etc.) then the extended cut of the film will not do much to satisfy you.  However, there are several additions that should make purists markedly happier:  Here are a few:<br />-The Return of Gandalf is amped up with additional dialogue, including some classic, spine-tingling Tolkien prose: \\"Something is about to happen that hasn't happened for an age.  The ents are going to wake up... and find that they are strong.\\"<br />-Treebeard is given more dignified lines and scenes.<br />-Faramir's motivations are at last understood.  He wants to please his demanding father (great performance here by John Noble as Denethor), but in the end understands that the Ring would enslave the Steward of Gondor.  Thus he releases Frodo to complete his errand.<br />-An explanation by Gandalf of the \\"One Advantage\\" of the West: that Sauron would never expect that the Ringbearer's quest will be to destroy the Ring.<br />There are several more great additions that I will leave a surprise.   <br />In summation, for those that loved the book and loved the 1st film, but were disappointed with the Theatrical TTT, this new, LONG, version of TTT is richer and more enjoyable than the theatrical cut, but is not \\"nearly perfect\\" - as I thought the extended version of FOTR was.  I still give it 4 out of 5 stars, as it is a far better film than most of the junk that is being made these days (Fellowship would get 6 out of 5 stars, in my opinion).
B0000041LL|5.0|There are obviously many recordings of Beethoven's string quartets.  This is my favorite performance of them, and the depth of feeling is unparalleled.  In particular, Op. 131 is perhaps the most beautiful music ever written.  The performance of the allegro molto vivace movement is lithe and delightfully playful while the adagio quasi un poco andante movement is impossibly slow and as somber as a funeral.  It must be the rarest performance to have so mastered such breadth of style and emotive content.  On this basis, the best performance of Beethoven's string quartet warrants the five stars, but be forewarned that the recording is of only passable quality.  Though made in the 1970s, one might well guess its vintage as a decade earlier.
B0000AQZYM|1.0|Two months after I took my son to see this, he was still asking what happened to Nemo's mom....<BR>Too sad that killing parents is still the best they can figure out to make a &quot;childrens' movie...
B00000K31Q|2.0|I had read the reviews as well as heard my friends' opinions on this movie and had thought that it would be great and witty and funny...and it was a great disappointment.<br />Kat and Bianca are sisters in the same school, Bianca being popular and Kat the polar opposite. Popular boy Joey wants Bianca and she feels likewise. However, their dad won't let Bianca date unless Kat does...which seems impossible to him. In order to have Bianca, Joey pays Patrick to woo Kat and date her. Seeing the money, Pat goes for it, only to fall in love with Kat...even though he's still taking money. Cameron is also in love with Bianca and had planned to tell Joey to pay Pat so that when Bianca can date, she would choose him. However, his plot is foiled until the end, when Bianca realizes what a bastard Joey is.<br />When I had seen the trailer, with Heath Ledger singing, I had thought this was when their true feelings are revealed. Little did I know that he was still taking money from Joey. This just seemed very much like betrayal to me and I didn't like that in a romantic comedy. I would never be able to forgive the guy as quickly as Kat did.<br />Also, I felt that there were so many subplots that the movie was all over the place. It felt as if the director was trying to ram all this information into and hour and something of film. As a result, many of the subplots are underdeveloped. Such as the romance between Cameron's geeky friend and Kat's Shakespearean addict friend. Also, Cameron and Bianca barely had any chemistry and Cameron's reasons for transferring are never referred to...he was just there one day, saw Bianca and wanted her. Joey and Bianca's \\"relationship\\" was also very fuzzy. Not to mention the part where Kat reveals to Bianca the very reason why she hates Joey and Bianca storms out of the room in anger.<br />The only redeeming qualities of this movie is the hilarious counselor and Kat and Bianca's father, who's comical talent is seen in this film, which is why it received two stars instead of one.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is probably one of the funniest movies ever made, I can't remember any other comedies where I've laughed so hard. The story revolves around Jeff Lebowski (played by Jeff Bridges), also known as \\"The Dude\\". A couple of thugs accidently mistake him for another Jeff Lebowski (who turns out to be a millionaire), and after realizing that they've got the wrong person, they proceed to pee on his rug. That's when things are set into motion. The plot itself is actually very complex, but by the end of the movie, everything fits together nice and neatly.<br />Throughout the movie, we meet lovable and well acted characters such as the Dude's friend and bowling partner, Walter (played by John Goodman). He gives the best performance with his easily enraged, gun-toting personality which is perfectly offset by his devotion to his ex-wife and the way he seems to remember his war buddies from Nam at the most inoppurtune moments. Some of the situations him and the Dude get into are the funniest moments in the movie. Other great performances include Donnie (played by  Steve Buscemi), who is the submissive and somewhat nerdy bowling partner of the Dude and Walter. And a brief, yet hilarious performance is given by John Turturro who plays the hispanic bowling fiend, Jesus (yes, it's pronounced \\"Jee-zus\\").<br />One of the things that stand out is the dialogue which really pulls the movie together. The conversations that erupt between the characters flow extremely well and are endlessly quotable. Something that's missing in a lot of comedies these days.<br />Aside from the the great acting and dialogue, one thing that stands out are the subtle nuances that reward repeated viewings such as the jokes that might've flown right over your head during earlier viewings, pop-culture refrences, or small plot details.<br />The only thing that really bothered me is the DVD itself. The menues suck, and the only special features include a trailer, a badly done documentary on the movie, and small bios on the cast. Nothing that isn't on every other DVD that comes out, but hopefully special edition of The Big Lewboski will come out one of these days. Aside from that one small problem, I reccomend anyone who's in for an awesome comedy to go buy this.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. I have honestly watched it at least 10 times. It's one of the sweetest stories ever made, a great adaption of the Cinderella story.<br />Danielle de Barbourac, after the death of her father, grows up as a servant girl under her stepmother and two stepsisters (one of which is not so bad). She is a girl with a strong will and a stronger throwing arm, as she flings apples at the runaway prince as he speeds away on her family's horse. He is thrown off the animal by her strikes...Danielle realizes its the prince, and so the story truly begins.<br />Prince Henry dreads having an arranged marriage to the Princess of Spain and has ran away many times. He is in many respects, still a young boy. After this episode, the King informs him that he will have until the masked ball to choose his own wife, or else the arrangement with Spain holds.<br />Henry sees Danielle again as she dresses up like a courtier to save one of the servants that her stepmother has sold into slavery. She looks familiar, but Henry can't recall. He is intrigued by this spitfire of a girl and Danielle leaves him with the name Countess Nicole de Lancre.<br />The romance evolves through several forbidden &quot;dates&quot; with Leonardo da Vinci as the &quot;fairy godfather&quot;. Meanwhile, Baroness de Ghent (the stepmother) and Marguerite (evil stepsister) has had their eyes on the Prince ever since they received news that he will be able to choose his own bride.<br />I will not ruin the climax of the movie as it is the best part of the film. But needless to say, they lived happily ever after. It's a wonderfully enchanting film and Drew Barrymore couldn't be more perfect for the role. This movie also has many great quotes full of wit, humor, and love. It will touch your heart and I couldn't recommend this film more. It's a must-see and a must-buy!<br />The score by George Fenton is also powerful, touching, and magical. I recommend the soundtrack for all lovers of the movie as well as classical music.
B00005JLYW|1.0|Pushes the stupid button so often that it is painfull to watch-if you think I'm being harsh-my 14 year old son passed on watching this for the cartoon channel. So much for the draw of T &amp; A.
B00005JMFI|5.0|My daughter and I say this movie. Everyone was laughing including us. It was so funny and innocent. It had a great message in all the slap stick comedy that touched your heart and kept us laughing. Can't wait till the dvd comes out to laugh some more.
0312319517|5.0|La novela tiene claramente dos facetas: por un lado la trama de acción, original, bien urdida y absolutamente adictiva; por otro lado está todo el trabajo de documentación que justifica, precisamente, la trama de acción. Es una novela que clarifica muchos de los actuales acontecimientos que hoy están sucediendo en los puntos más conflictivos (calientes) del Globo.<br />Es una magnífica mezcla de novela de acción, espionaje y periodismo internacional, todo ello escrito en un lenguaje preciso y directo que te absorbe desde la primera página hasta la última.
B000002RXS|5.0|I'm not a Callas fan, but I find this recording riveting!  I think her Chason Boheme is absolutely outstanding!  What fire and passion.  Yes, there are a few ugly and ill-focused notes, but this tessitura suits her in a way that NORMA did not at that time in her career.  I still am bothered by that bottled and covered voice but Carmen bothers me very little.  <BR>Gedda is wonderful as always and, though I wish Freni was cast as Michaela, the rest of the cast sings admirably.  My favorite Carmen.
0385504209|1.0|I'll keep this short, as I already wasted too much time reading the book.  I admit I read this hoping that there was something unique about it.  Sadly disappointing in its predictability.  Anytime the sleeve notes say something like &quot;wickedly clever&quot; or &quot;a must read&quot;, run, run far away.

B00005JMFR|5.0|I have to recognize that after the first time I saw Matrix Revolutions I felt a little bit dissapointed. However, after three times more, you start to realize how amazing this movie is. Personally speaking, I think the movie close almost perfectly with all the two previous movies. More than this, it makes Reloaded a better movie -I love Reloaded- but Revolutions add more info that helps Reloaded for a better understanding.  All you need is to put some attention in some clues here, there and everywhere in Revolutions and then you start to notice the meaning of the movie and the meaning of the whole trilogy and the circle begins to get closed.  A circle that started back in 1999 when The Matrix took the world by storm. One thing, you can not compare Revolutions with the Matrix. That is beyond any comparisson but if you take Reloaded+Revolutions then you probably will have a 258 minutes movie -a gigantic one- that honors The Matrix. Hail The Matrix Reloaded Revolutions.    If you ask me What is the Matrix Trilogy major achivement? Well I would answer you with this: It was and is to put Philosophy outside the scholar's classroom and into the everyday world. Thanks to this movies I was able to know about Descartes and Baudrillard, Charles Taylor and Budhissm and Hindu Mithology. all this for free -all I needed was my own desire to learn more about the underlying messages in the movies. This has not price.  Revolutions achieved that and more. And on the SFX, well it has raised the bars for upcoming and future movies. The Zion battle is the very CGA definition and the Superbrawl, well Superman, you better watch out. . .
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). &quot;Toy Story&quot; 1 &amp; 2 and &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; are some of my favorite family films; &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.<br />As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In &quot;Toy Story&quot; they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; they showed us the monster world. In my review on &quot;A Bug's Life,&quot; I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.<br />This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.<br />Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets whyMarlin is following her.)<br />Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie &quot;Platoon&quot; might have something to do with that.<br />This is taken from my &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; review: &quot;Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.<br />With &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios isprobably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they seperate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it's almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.
0316666343|4.0|I know that this is a really good book.  But I also have to admit that the beginning was kinda freaky to me and that the rest of the book was equally odd.  But it was still pretty good. Suggestion: DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS READ THIS!!!!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I didn't quite know what to expect going into \\"The Matrix Reloaded,\\" and I came out with mixed feelings. This is a sequel to the 1999 film that enthralled audiences. I was a bit underwhelmed by the original, and so I figured the sequel would either be better given my disappointment in the first, or even worse. There's no doubt it's a good film, but it has some very bleak, almost corny scenes with long, metaphorical speeches. There is either too much or too little thought put into this film.<br />It takes place, supposedly, a few days after the original. Neo can fly, Trinity wears tighter and shinier leather costumes, and Morpheus is fatter. Neo dreams that Trinity dies in the opening sequence. Then back in Zion they realize that 250,000 sentinals are digging their way into Zion. In order to stop something they need something that does something which involves, though does not limit to, (...), kissing Persephone (Monica Belluci), rescuing a Keymaker, having a long car chase, beating up people, cloning Unleashed Agent Smiths (who appears not nearly as often as the trailer would lead you to believe), and blowing up things.<br />This film's plot goes to waste very quickly and so it falls back on special effects. They're great, yes, but not very different from all the \\"Matrix\\"-rip-off films we've been getting since the original. The beginning sequence wows the audience with terrific special effects, but later in the film they must have run short on their budget because Neo's fight with the million Agent Smiths (...) Either one works.<br />(...)\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" really only has some good action scenes, which includes a highway chase atop of cars, trucks, motercycles and more, that goes on and on for seventeen minutes. Action fans will eat it up.<br />But it's not exactly the smartest of films. It thinks it's really smart, it tries to prove it, but scenes like that with \\"The Architect\\" (NOT the Archeologist) prove the movie is out of ideas. It tries to continue the smartness and freshness of the first film and tries to have revelations, but they confused me because the film moved through all the plot scenes too quickly so they could return to the action. Maybe they will be all sorted out in \\"The Matrix Revolutions,\\" which opens in November. I certainly hope so.<br />\\"The Matrix\\" may not have been one of my favorite films but I did like it to a certain degree. It seemed pretty smart and a breakthrough achievment in special effects. It targeted all filmgoers - from sci-fi to action to drama to romance - whereas \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" really only targets two audiences - die-hard fans of the original and sci-fi-lovers. That's probably one of its biggest of many flaws.<br />But it is still a pretty good movie.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have read many reviews for this album, saying it is not as powerful as &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; or &quot;Surfacing&quot;.  In some ways it isn't, but I personally feel the album as with her last two studio albums, &quot;Fumbling, and Surfacing&quot;, are like one long opus.  &quot;Fumbling&quot; being a beginning, to &quot;Surfacing&quot; being the middle and heart shattering part of our lives (it helped me through my father's death: Full of Grace is the most soul wrenching song ever written) and &quot;Afterglow&quot; being the moment of understanding.  I've just found understanding in my life, and listening to this album lets me feel that understanding.  From the simple &quot;fallen&quot; to the throat clenching, &quot;stupid&quot; to my all time fav Sarah song &quot;answer&quot; the  album is just one more step in Sarah's awakening.  &quot;Afterglow&quot; is not as soul searching as &quot;Fumbling&quot; or as heart shattering as &quot;Surfacing&quot; but it's a step in her musical and spiritual life that everyone should find.  A step away from pain and resentment to clarity and understanding.  A must have
B00005JKZV|4.0|There is the rare occasion when a sequel is as good as its predecessor. &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; &quot;Toy Story 2,&quot; &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day.&quot; I tried to put different genres into that, and if I can squeeze in fantasy, it would be &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.&quot;<br />Based on the famous/classic work by J.R.R. Tolkien, this is the second &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film to grace the screen, or, as its fans refer to it, &quot;LotR.&quot; In the previous film we saw Middlearth (one word?), home of the human-like species of Hobbits, brought to life by director Peter Jackson. It was bright, cheery, happy...but &quot;LotR: TTT&quot; is much darker than its predecessor. No cheery shots of grassy plains here; it's dark, broody, and evil.<br />In the first film, we found out that long ago a creature/figure known as Sauron created a mystical ring deep in the craters of Mount Doom, located conveniently in the evilest place in the whole wide world, Mordor. (Just listen to Hugo Weaving say &quot;Mordor&quot;--it sounds creepy.)<br />To get to the chase, Sauron was temporarily destroyed, and the ring, through one way or another, came to the creature Gollum, who then lost it to a Hobbit named Bilbo (who, in Tolkien's novel &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; found it on a quest with Gandalf--a story not ventured into much in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;).<br />Years passed, and Sauron grew stronger (even though he's sorta dead), and he sent out baddies to try and hunt down the Ring, so that he may use its power (only he can wield the ring) for evil. Bilbo had since left the ring to Frodo, his kin, who then fled Middlearth with three others (four if you count Gandalf). Soon a few more joined their quest, and these men, Hobbits, and what not, formed a Fellowship. Their quest is to venture into Mordor and destroy the ring where it was created. <br />At the end of the first film the Fellowship of the Ring had been seperated. Here's what has happened so far in the second film: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) found Gollum, who becomes their tour guide to Mordor.<br />Aragorn, Legolas and co. made their way to a castle somewhere, that is about to be attacked by a band of Orcs led by Saruman (Christopher Lee). They prepare for the battle by readying troops.<br />Pippin and Merry escaped from the band of Orcs that kidnapped them at the end of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; where they came upon talking, walking trees, one of which took them to the much-alive Gandalf, who says that he died and returned to earth as &quot;Gandalf the White&quot; (versus Gandalf the Grey) to help out the Fellowship.<br />That's the main plot, but the film (ranking it at just about three hours) has so many characters that is constantly either a) forgets about some (not much of Frodo and Sam in this film), or b) tries to remember them by abruptly cutting to them. One of the film's only flaws is its inability to focus on all the characters equally; a feat &quot;X-Men 2&quot; accomplished quite nicely.<br />The new character Gollum is a scene-stealer. Easily the best character in the film. One of the most impressive visual effects I have ever seen, which I suppose is because he was formed from images of a real man running around, and then was just overlapped with graphics and such.<br />&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is fun to watch, and though some scenes could definitely have been dropped on the cutting room floor, the film more than makes up for the overlong scenes. I especially liked a battle between Aragorn and his troops, and Orcs on top of creatures that look like a mix between hyenas, dogs, and pigs. The dog-creatures move extremely fast and viciously (but of course the good guys still win ;). And the last half hour or so is one gigantic battle against Orcs, and the special effects are truly enthralling.<br />You liked the first film? You're going to really enjoy this one. You didn't like the first film? You're still going to enjoy this one. I thought the original film was a tad overrated. Okay, a lot overrated. Seeing that on IMDb it suddenly beat out every single movie ever made and ranked in at the no. 1 film of all time, you can say I was fumin' a bit. It was good, and I especially liked the shooting locations in New Zealand, but you can say I wasn't exactly a huge fan.<br />If I had to choose a favorite so far, I may very well say &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; It's hard, because the first had some great scenery. This one loses the brightness of the first film, and I must say I liked the cheeriness of the original. (Of course, it is supposed to lost the brightness, just like the book did, because they are venturing closer to Mordor.)<br />I expect &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; to excite all the &quot;LotR&quot; geeks out there, and thrill the regular audiences. I just wish the fans would stop getting thirty usernames on IMDb and voting &quot;10&quot; millions of times.
080013558X|1.0|Iam john and i like the disney one better. That one is great than any otther of the old ones. There is nothing wrong with this one but i said what i said.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Who said sequels aren't any good? &quot;Terminator 2&quot; is the ultimate sequel, a big bad wolf ready to chomp the head off of anyone who crosses its path. It's dark, it's mean, and it's one tough movie. It's not as bleak as the first film, at least in terms of visuals, but rather has a new kind of bluish-tint that supplies a great backdrop to the ongoing battle between man and machine.<br />If there was ever a contemporary mainstream visionary director, it is James Cameron. Here we've got Cameron's real thoughts on the series, those repressed by a low budget in the original film. He lets loose here, filling every frame with hard-boiled action and special effects. He introduces a liquid metal Terminator that he wanted to use in the first film, but graphic processors and CGI were not advanced enough in 1984, at least not advanced enough to work on the low means he had to film the original. So his original dream is finally unveiled, and good golly, gee Molly, is it wonderful.<br />Yeah, he's &quot;back.&quot; Arnold (like he needs any introduction?) returns as The Terminator, Series T-101, Model T-800, an indestructible cyborg sent from the future to assassinate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in the first film. Well, it's 1991. New film. New mission. He has to save the future resistance leader of mankind who will ultimately defeat the machines of the future, John Connor (Edward Furlong), Sarah's 11-year-old son. (Though his age has been switched from 11 to 13 and back to 9 over the years, with no help from the third film that takes place in 2003, yet claims he was 13 in 1991 though his age doesn't match with his age in the third. We'll just leave it at 11 in this film. Got that?)<br />Another model Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), has been sent back to 1991 programmed to annihilate John Connor. Which explains Arnold's appearance. Arnold, an undoubtedly lesser opponent compared to the T-1000, has to help save the day and learn to appreciate humanity. It won'tbe easy. First, he has to find John Connor, who is a rebellious angst-driven pre-teen living with foster parents. Then, together they have to break into the local loony hospital and release Sarah from the clutches of Dr. Silberman (Earl Boen), who believes Sarah is delusional. (You may remember Silberman as the psychiatrist from the first film, too.) Then, they have to stop a computer chip designer (Joe Morton) from creating the first version of a SkyNet computer, modeled after a destroyed chip his employment company discovered at a large mechanical warehouse. (Which is, of course, the chip from the destroyed T-800 of the first film.)<br />Whew. On with the film analysis, right? Where to start? This isn't as fierce or brutal as the first film, but it's got plentiful action sequences, a large budget, great special effects (even compared to those gracing the screen nowadays), not to mention a great character study of the machine we loved to root against in the first film. Of course, this Terminator has no memory of the first film, since he wasn't in it--SkyNet creates hordes of the same version machines on a large conveyor belt and ships them off to fight in the war. Some are sent back through time. So, with that in mind, John Connor's resistance found an extra Arnold lying around in an abandoned warehouse, programmed him to keep John Connor out of harm, and sent him through the time portal.<br />Sarah doesn't trust him. In a deleted scene available on the Ultimate and &quot;Xtreme&quot; edition DVDs, Sarah says, &quot;You don't know what it's like to try and kill one of these things!&quot; It's an important scene that should have been left in the final cut. In it, Sarah is about to destroy the machine's central processing chip located inside his head, when John stops her. It's important because it focuses on the fact that Sarah still doesn't trust him, and came close to destroying him purely out of prejudice, without giving him a chance. As much as I don't like it when people go on about hidden meanings in films that obviously are not meant to have hidden meanings and are purely little flubs made by directors unrightfully analyzed for deeper meaning(s), &quot;T2&quot; clearly has an underlying message: One, don't judge a book by its cover. Read it first. Two, if an emotionless killing machine can learn to appreciate life, why can't everyone? And three, the most important fact of all: Never mess with a muscular man who walks into a bar completely naked and requests your clothes and means of transportation.<br />I suppose the question on most interested viewers' minds is this: Is &quot;T2: Judgment Day&quot; better than its predecessor? Well, in some respects, yes. In others, no. It lacks the fierce brutality and darkness of the first film, but makes up for it with spectacular visual effects and action sequences. It lacks the horrific central focus of the first film (futuristic, indestructible cyborgs with no feelings being able to unemotionally kill), but it makes up for this with a new focus of humanity, coming to accept your future, and how it would look if two colossal killing machines entered into an arena together.<br />If you're looking for an action film, &quot;T2&quot; is your safest bet. It's ten times better than the other junk out there, and it has a definite, not-stop, pulse-pounding sense of action, that leaves you trying to catch your breath. It has a strong narrative and a clear statement on our society. On the other hand, &quot;The Terminator&quot; is probably the film for horror fans, time travel film fans, or those who like to be thrilled while they're watching their films regarding the future.<br />In some respects, I like the first better. But then I think about the second film and I have a hard time choosing. I suppose if I had to choose I'd choose the first film. And let me just state for the record that I'm glad I don't have to choose.
B00009TB5G|3.0|(...)now bact to the movie, because, mabeye, if someone is whining, wow what a concept, it might mean somthing. <BR>   what i have to sat about the trilogy to date is that it one of the most visually stunning pieces of cinema in a long time. period. the producers of these movies must have read my mind, because they have been on the same track that my minds eye was when i first read the books. no matter what else is said about the series, i commend the producers on that momentous feat. congrats. <BR>   now personally, i will be watching this very intensely, why? because if the directors and editors dont clean things up in the two towers like they did the fellowship of the ring, i am going to boycott the release of the 3rd installment, mabeye even protest it, see u on the news!! they have been stadily going downhill since the release of the first movie in regards to the accuracy to the books, and i do understand some, if not most of the changes made, but they have, with the release of this second film, actually made changes contrawise to what the brilliant mind tolkein put on paper over half a century ago. (...)<BR>   now I can totally understand having to make changes to convert the book, with tolkeins gift for imagery and dialouge, to a visual format like a movie, i see where u can and need to make changes, but elrond even encouraged the union of aragorn and arwen, to paraphrase, 'just as long as you win!', no joke, JUST READ. but to make (...), er elrond, sorry, actually opposed to their union is just one of the many problems that i personally had with this movie, just one example of many, that has actually angered, mildly, this fan of tolkein. <BR>  bottom line, if you like good movies with cool effects, go for it, enjoy the cg animation, and dont forget the popcorn because they ARE good movies that are well done for the most part. And besides, it may just spark your interest enough to go read these wonderful books, which is never bad. IF you like the books for what they are, and for story, unless they get their act together on this one, i will have totally lost interest in the series, and will refuse to back this effort to commercialize somthing that should be shared with everyone, but never stepped on. I may be alone on this in todays world, but i would rather read the book anyway, even if the movie was brilliantly perfect, and i can never spread that word enough, because the brain is the most amazing thing we know about, and using it is such a wonderful thing...
B00005JM0B|4.0|A little low-budget film named \\"The Terminator\\" hit the streets in 1984. This extremely low-budget actioner was about a machine \\"terminator\\" sent back in time to assassinate, or \\"terminate\\" the soon-to-be mother of the future world resistance leader, who would fight back against Skynet's machines who would fight for their dominance of the earth.<br />19 years later, and one sequel later, comes \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,\\" the massive differences between the original film being the budget, special effects, and action pieces. Being a long-time \\"Terminator\\" fan, of both \\"T1\\" and \\"T2,\\" I can tell you this baby don't disappoint. )(...) When production finally started, and was delayed to 2003, and started again, I held my breath and expected the best. After the trailer I expected the worst. Now I got the best. This film blows you away, it's the best sequel of the year and James Cameron's absence from the film, though visible, doesn't hinder it.<br />Judgment Day never happened. The world never got hit by nuclear bombs, the machines took over, and now a twenty-something John Connor lives \\"off the grids,\\" with no home, no telephone, no nothing. Just in case the machines happen to take over one day in the future and try to assassinate him again.<br />Of course, the machines DO come back again, as without them there would be no sequel. One is a sexy terminator called the Terminatrix (Kristanna Loken), whose mission is to assassinate John Connor's future lieutenants and his future wife, a current veterinarian, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), since the machines can't find where John Connor is (that's where the off-the-grid stuff comes in handy for him). However, John Connor happens to meet up with Kate Brewster the same night the TX tries to kill her (and now him since he is a primary target for termination), but the T-800 model cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is also back to protect them, who has been sent back in time by Kate Brewster in the future after the protectioncyborg murdered John Connor...in the future, that is...err...confused yet?<br />Wow, what a thrill ride. Give me a moment to catch my breath. Action non-stop throughout, great special effects, everything. It's nowhere near as great as the first two films, but as far as summer sequels go, this ranks in as one of the best.<br />Arnold is back in fine form after \\"End of Days\\" (I liked \\"The 6th Sense\\" and \\"Collateral Damage\\"), and for a brief moment in the film (when he throws Kate into the back of a truck), the way he is outlined against the night sky makes him look just like he did in the first film. His haircut is very much the same in that shot. Anywho, he's back.<br />Nick Stahl takes over for druggie Edward Furlong in this installment, and by George he is great! Claire Danes doesn't do much but scream and run around and look pretty, but there's more purpose for her being there than in most movies like this.<br />Like I said before, James Cameron's absence from the film IS visible, but new director Jonathan Mostow does a great job of taking over from him. The film is lacking some of the human elements that made the first so great, and it feels more like a regular action blockbuster than the predecessors. \\"T2\\" set a new level for action films; \\"T3\\" is more of a follower than a revolutionary film such as the first two. The special effects are impressive, but just like all the other films out there nowadays. \\"T3\\" in no way is as vicious, dark, or amazing as the first two films, which are both some of my favorite films, but Jonathan Mostow has done a great job handling Cameron's baby, and it shows, making \\"T3\\" neither disappointing nor bad; it's the best film of the summer, and one of the best action films in a long line of dull flicks. <br />And in conclusion, I can honestly say that he'll be back. Trust me. So stick around. When he's back, I'll be back. But for now, hasta la vista, baby.

B00000JMOJ|4.0|&quot;Running Man&quot; is based on a story by Richard Bachman, a.k.a. Stephen King writing under pseudonym. <br />It takes place in the near future, where everything is run by the media and the government. Kind of like right now. In the future, there isn't much selection on television. All there is is &quot;The Running Man&quot;--hosted by Damon Killian (Richard Dawson, host of &quot;Family Fortune&quot; in real life)--a show that features convicts, or &quot;runners&quot; being chased by madmen, or &quot;stalkers.&quot; It's a bit like a futuristic gladiator sport. No one ever, ever wins the show. But Schwarzenegger has yet to play. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, also known as The Butcher of Bakersfield, for firing upon a crowd of humans in a food strike. Only one problem. He's been framed--he never shot anyone. After Arnie escapes from jail, Damon Killian wants his hands on him for the show--so they hunt him down and bring him in. Damon offers Ben a deal--if he goes on the show, he'll let his friends from jail go free. But if he doesn't...he puts his friends on. So Richards agrees to play the game, only to find that Damon has put his friends-from-jail in the show anyway. Right before being launched in the arena, Ben Richards says to Damon, &quot;Hey, Damon. I'll be back.&quot; There is a pause. &quot;Only in a rerun,&quot; Damon says. Yeah, right.<br />This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched an action movie you're going to see in a while. We see an excuse for Schwarzenegger being thrown into an arena with killers, where he must use his brains, strategy, and most of all muscles, to kill the stalkers. But the thing is, the excuse for throwing Schwarzenegger in the arena is a good one. They didn't completely ignore the plot; they don't even throw him in the arena until at least a half hour into the film. They set up the plot first, which is nice.<br />Arnold proves his acting talent is not just in his muscles once again. Too many peoplemake fun of Schwarzenegger's acting skills, but to tell you the truth, I prefer him over Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone any day. Bruce and Sly are mumblers, in my opinion. Anyway, I like Arnold in this movie, because unlike in &quot;The Terminator&quot; where he is an indestructible cyborg, he is a vincible human with emotions in this film. We see a different side to Schwarzenegger, and it's pretty nice.<br />Richard Dawson is surprisingly good as Damon. I love his charisma on screen. Of course he's good at playing a gameshow host--he himself was one--but he also has a very good acting talent. Check out the scene where he offers Arnold a deal for going on the show. Look how smug he is in that scene, and how well he delivers his lines. He envelops his character very well. An underrated actor if ever I saw one. He comes off slightly creepy and slightly likable.<br />This movie is good fun no matter how you slice and dice it. I've often noticed it has a bit of a weird vibe to it, but then I realized that's just the sci-fi/futuristic vibe of the film. I've felt it before when watching sci-fi films. There's something about them. When I watch a film, or a certain genre, I get different vibes. Sci-fi gives me a weird vibe that is undescribable. This film gives that vibe to me. It sounds weird, but I think a lot of people get &quot;vibes&quot; and don't realize it.<br />I recently viewed this movie twice in less than a day; once at night and once in the morning. It just goes to show how easy it is to watch. It is strictly a fun, action film with lots of imagination and charisma. Easy to watch with a high re-watch factor.<br />What would you rather do with 90 minutes of your life on a Friday night than watch Arnold Schwarzenegger get to knock some skulls together in a gladiator arena? Exactly.
0679745203|3.0|Ondaatje has a marvelous way with words but somehow the story seems a little too romantic and self-serving, given the situation in which he embeds his characters.  The story loosely revolves around Count Almasy, who was quite a different person in real life, especially in terms of his sexuality.  But, Ondaatje doesn't let such little things deter him from telling his tale.<br />Ondaatje approaches his works as an Impressionist.  The colors are muted and blended into each other to create a stunning variety of illusions which carry the reader along with their figurative charm.  The situations seem drawn largely from romance novels but are given a more earthy tone in the way he tells his stories.  He weaves together essentially two stories, with the Count as the bridge between these two worlds.  It is a way to tell of WWII on two fronts: the African front at the height of the war and the Italian front after the Americans had overwhelmed Mussolini's republic. Ondaatje uses romance to soften the effects of war with the only gritty character being Caravaggio.<br />The book translated well to film, with wonderful performances by Dafoe, Fiennes and Binoche. But, in its own right there isn't much to hold the reader beyond its well worn images of love in the time of war.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album has to be listened to more then once to be enjoyed, when i first heard it, it seemed short, sparse, and seemed to be missing something, but i kept listening and it all came together.<BR>Production/lyrics: its obviously less dance/pop then the last 2 efforts (ray of light/music) but if you want that then you can buy the singles with the remixes, it takes the direction where &quot;Music&quot; left off.  I made some connections between the 2 albums, &quot;Nobody knows me&quot;/&quot;Impressive Instant&quot;,&quot;Nothing Fails&quot;/&quot;Don't tell me&quot;, &quot;Easy Ride&quot; seemed to blend &quot;Gone, &quot;Don't tell me&quot;, and traces of &quot;Frozen&quot; Shes seems to be trying to blend the styles of previous songs, with an all new message while capturing the sound of both previous albums. Does she need to completly change her sound and style with each release, no. And I think thats why it turned people away.<BR>Singles:  The singles aren't taking off on the charts because of hip/hop and rap dominating its a phase in music, and it will pass, yes its unfortunate that the singles only charted on the dance charts and not the pop charts. That doesn't mean the songs are terrible, its just what the teens are listening to these days. Hey its Madonna and she will put out what she feels important not crap, your hardcore fans are still with you, regardless if your album doesn't &quot;take off&quot; we love you!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is a beautifully packaged 2-DVD set of the quintessential Western saga.  The movie never looked so good as it does in this restored version.<br />Sergio Leone's masterpiece turned the notion of a Western on its head, most visibly by portraying Henry Fonda as a bad guy.  The star-studded cast plays their low-key roles to the hilt.  None better than Bronson, who was really in his element in this movie.  But, all the credit should go to Leone for coming up with a fantastic story that weaves together so many themes of the West into one of the most evocative films ever made.  Leone never loses his step, building the movie thematically, with a musical score that lifts the film to the level of opera.  This was the crowning achievement of Leone's \\"spaghetti\\" westerns.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This album generally continues in the style of their breakthrough album, Silver Side Up, but there is some experimentation, such as mellow songs \\"Feelin' Way too Damn Good\\" and \\"Should've Listened\\", and songs with guitar solos and a strange ethereal atmosphere \\"Do This Anymore (one of the best)\\".  All the material is easily as well written and good as the first 2 albums, though there is an obvious radio single with \\"Someday\\".  The band has pushed their sound to new extremes, shown by the actually-pretty-heavy almost metal sound of \\"Flat on the Floor\\".  The drummer is also more featured, this time using some quick + fast double bass patterns that he didn't show he could do before now.  Overall, a solid step in the right direction for Nickelback.  True their is only so much they can do with their poppish grunge-influenced sound, but I think that without changing their sound, this is the best they could do.  I praise Nickelback for being the only popular band I know that stays good on their second major popular CD.  Even Staind and Korn suck now.  The only dissapointment is that there's nothing like my favorite Nickelback song \\"Woke up this Morning\\" on here.  They should make more songs like that.<br /><br />Recommended if you like Nickelback.  Some might think it's too poppy.<br /><br />In retrospect I'd rate this album 4 stars.  Only releases with no bad songs and few noticable flaws get 5.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Well, we have waited about 6 years for her follow up to the INCREDIBLE 'Surfacing'.<BR>It is worth the wait?<BR>For me personally, NO - I am disappointed.<BR>As usual her vocals are absolutely beautiful, and on the occasions were she uses her lower register - WOW! I would like to hear more sung in that key.<BR>But there is no 'Building a Mystery', 'Sweet Surrender', 'Adia' or 'Angel', or even 'Witness'.  Nothing matches the power of those songs.  'Fallen', the lead track and single is beautiful, and probably the strongets track.  Everyone will have their own favourite, but I don't believe anyone would consider it better.<BR>This album is much of a muchness, the same throughout.
B00000I8BX|5.0|However, fear factory is not.  Obsolete is, simply put, a great album. What many people don't realize, however, is that's it's not all about the music with Obsolete, it's about the music in relation to the story in the booklet.  The album's lyrics follow the story in the booklet, and if one or two songs simply blast and have no melody and just blast, it's because of the story (If you have this album, think track 8).  I own the digipak version of this album.  It comes with 5 bonus tracks as well as the original ten, and I would say they are worth your extra money.  I can't really say whether this is Fear Factory's best or not, considering the only other FF album I own is Digimortal, but it is definitely worth your time.  Here is my track by track review.<br />1) Shock (8/10) A somewhat good opener.  Not as good as \\"What Will Become?\\" on Digimortal, but still good.  Insanely heavy, and the only melody comes in the form of Burton holding notes.<br />Meaning- About putting a \\"shock to the system\\".<br />2) Edgecrusher (10/10) Kind of rappish, but that's OK 'cuz rap-metal isn't bad for the most part.  Nice bassline during the chorus.  An FF classic.<br />Meaning- \\"Edgecrusher\\" is the (good) terrorist from the story in the booklet.<br />3) Smasher/Devourer (10/10) One of those FF songs that mixes melody and screaming rather well.  The low singing (I am the way) during the chorus is reminiscient of what I've heard from Soul of a New Machine (Major-laber debut) and Concrete (Independent first release).  Nice singing after the chorus.<br />Meaning- The \\"Smasher/Devourer\\" is, in effect, a futuristic police robot in the story.  It tracks criminals down.<br />4) Securitron (Police State 2000) (9/10) At the start of this song, it sounds like a police raid, and someone says \\"There is a Fear Factory in this division\\".  Other than that, this song isn't really that memorable.  Chorus has singing, but really doesn't convey any sort of tune to the listener.  Creepy melody during the bridge.  I like when he says \\"no place to hide\\".<br />Meaning- Securitron is the security organization of future.  They cameras placed all over the place, apparently.<br />5) Descent (15/10) This is total change from the first 4 tracks, and that may be because it is discussing things human rather than machine related things.  I LOVE the guitar riff and drumbeat.  This is one their \\"all singing\\" tracks.  Oh, I bought the CD because of this song also.  My favorite track on the album.<br />Meaning- Edgecrusher is comtemplating whether his life is worth it.  Is he just descending further into oblivion?<br />6) Hi-Tech Hate (8/10)  A lot like Securtron.  There is nothing really special about this song except the cool special FX.  A good headbanging track.  I like when Burton screams \\"Cowards to all!\\".<br />Meaning- This song's words are supposed the speech of a rebellious man to group of anti-society activists.  They speak of man's war against the machines they created.<br />7) Freedom or Fire (10/10) My favorite of the heavier tracks.  The intro is so awesome, I love the guitar!  Dino is one my favorite guitarists of all time.  Screams most the way through, but when he starts singing it sounds so evil (in the coold kind of way).  My 3rd favorite.<br />Meaning- Relates to the man speaking in Hi-Tech Hate.  A bunch of  Securitron officers discover the activists and start causing chaos and destoying things. The man speaking lights himself on fire rather than being captured by the Securitron,  hence the name \\"Freedom or Fire\\".<br />8) Obsolete (7/10) Kind of just here to get the lyrics across and go with the story.  Everyone says it so terrible, but I like the guitar riffs.<br />Meaning- A robotic Secutitron officer picks up the megaphone the now flaming man was using.  The words of this song are what the officer yells through the megaphone.  It contrasts the words of Hi-Tech Hate. The booklet says something like \\"The intrument that was the once the voice of reason has now been transformed into a melted, mutated version of  disorder.\\"<br />9) Ressurection (10/10) Hugely different from the track before it, once again because it speaks of Edgecrusher and his whereabouts.  Has a lot of singing and almost seems positive rather than scary and mechanical like the rest of the album.  AMAZING, Love the strings. They could have made this the last track on the album.  My 2nd favorite.  If you havent yet, you must hear this before you judge Fear Factory.<br />Meaning- The meaning isn't as clear here as in the other songs.  I think it refers to the resurrection of the memories that have been forgotten since the world became so technology oriented.  During this part of the story, Edgecrusher finds a statue of a long dead man, and thinks he remembers it from somewhere.  I'm pretty sure the statue is supposed to of Jesus Christ.<br />10) Timelessness (10/10) In this track, the meaning and the music seem to coincide with each other.  Just Burton singing over some beautifully done strings.  Seems to be mourning the loss of everything that was lost during the course of the album.  The story in the booklet may seem a little far fetched to you at this point, but if you read it you will be able to tell that if things keep going the way they are, it could easily be this way by 2067 (when the story is set).<br />BONUS TRACKS-  These don't follow the story.<br />11) Cars (8/10) A Gary Numan cover featuring Gary Numan. This was a big single.  Like the orginal with added guitars and Burton singing.  The second or third best bonus track.<br />12) 0-0 (Where evil dwells) (9/10) EVIL.  Another cover.  Pure death metal.  Kind of creepy (as death metal should be).  About a serial killer in Northport, Long Island.<br />13) Soulwound (11/10) This is so awesome! By far the best bonus track. Worth your extra money alone.  Originally recorded for their now re-released first album \\"Concrete\\".  Havent heard the Concrete version, just this one.  Death metal, like 0-0.  I love it when he sings \\"Soulwound, soulwound, deep cuts cut deeper\\".<br />I like this better than some of the normal tracks.<br />14) Messiah (9/10) Some really cool intrumentals with Burton screaming \\"Messiah!\\" over the top.  I don't remember if it has any other lyrics or not.<br />15) Concreto (9/10) Sounds like a comic super-villain.  More death metal stuff.  Blasting bass drums and low singing.  I used to hate this.  I like it now.<br />GO BUY THIS ALBUM (The digi-pak version)into a melted, mutated version of  disorder.\\"<br />9) Ressurection (10/10) Hugely different from the track before it, once again because it speaks of Edgecrusher and his whereabouts.

B00005JMD3|2.0|No, it's not very good but what can be expected of a show based on a dullish 70s (short lived) TV show? There wasn't too much material there to begin with. At least it wasn't based on a Disneyworld Theme Ride.<br />It begins with a little promise of some real story about SWAT sniper Jim Street (up and coming Irish hottie Colin Farrell, who does an utterly convincing American accent) who has both career and girl friend troubles. Street's lifestyle, apartment etc., are presented realistic for a change -- he's not a fantasy cop living in a condo overlooking the ocean -- and the early action and training scenes when he gets back into SWAT are convincing. <br />It goes downhill in the 2nd half with an absurd \\"caper\\" involving a French billionaire drug dealer who offers ONE HUNDRED MEEELYYYION DOLLARS if some thug will bust him out of prison. Oliver Martinex, marginally convincing in last year's \\"Unfaithful\\" is utterly ridiculous in this role, although he didn't have a chance since the part is written absurdly. He too young, slightly built and \\"fashion model-ish\\" to be menacing, plus how scary are the FRENCH anyhow?<br />Samuel L. Jackson and Michelle Rodriguez are wasted in this. Jackson reprises his unexceptional role in \\"The Negotiator\\", to no great effect, and Rodriguez -- the rare actress who can believably come across as physically tough -- is just a PC addition to the rainbow coalition cast. She is given literally NOTHING to do, not even fire her weapon. There is a vague suggestion that she and Farrell's character will or have hooked up romantically, but something was left on the cutting room floor and this plotline isn't developed. The filmakers clearly haven't got a clue what to do with a female SWAT officer.<br />The rest of the cast are treated with such indifference, they barely register. Soundtrack is annoying and extremely LOUD, apparently designed for a urban audience close to deafness from listening to very loud boomboxes. This is a hugely irritating trendin action movies lately and is totally out of control.<br />SWAT units are an interesting part of the police force, and it's too bad that an ORIGINAL (non 70s TV series) script could not have been developed, especially one focusing on female officers in a male dominated arena. This movie lets down in virtually all aspects. Just a by the book, loud action flick with no character development and relying on noisy violence instead of the precision and cleverness one would normally associate with SWAT. Only worth renting for the testostorone impaired.
B000002NIW|5.0|Deftones- Around the Fur<br />This is a very good album. I wouldn't say it's better than Deftones' others, but it's good. It takes a little getting used to. It isn't conventional metal. Everything- the guitar riffs, the singer's voice, the lyrics, and drumbeats- everything is out of the ordinary. The first thought that came to mind when I first heard it was 'What were they thinking?'.  I thought it screamed too much, and that it wasn't catchy enough. Now it's one of my favorite albums. Here's my review of each track-<br />1) My Own Summer (Shove it) 13/15<br />Music: This song gets stuck in your head and will most likely be one of your favorites when you first listen to it, but it gets old fast because it only has one real hook, which is the guitar riff that runs through the song. The best part is in the bridge of the song where the guitar stops and all you can hear is the bass and the soft sounds of Chino's singing.<br />Best Lyric: The shade is a tool, a device, a savior.<br />2) Lhabia 14/15<br />Music: Completely devoid of any catchiness. The screaming at the end is kind of pointless. The fast guitar and frantic vocals gives it a kind of chaotic edge. Has a mellow, singing chorus. Really doesn't use the normal verse-chorus-verse song structure.<br />Best Lyric: Somewhere outside there are tricks and evil.<br />3) Mascara 10/15<br />Music: The slowest, quietest song on the album. It's a love song about Chino's wife. Peaceful atmosphere. A little bit boring. Usual song structure.  Good chorus.<br />Best Lyric: There's something about her long shady eyes.<br />4) Around the Fur 14/15<br />Music: Opens with a memorable drumbeat. Real heavy screaming chorus. This is a good example of what the album is like. The lyrics are strange and metaphorical. This was one of my favorites, but I listened to it too much and started listening to the other songs on the album. Goes crazy at the end and ends abruptly.<br />Best Lyric: Hey vanity, this vile is empty, and so are you.<br />5) Rickets 12/15<br />Music: The heaviest track on the album along with Lotion and Headup. Metal fans will like the guilt filled lyrics. All the vocals in the song are either whispering or screaming. No singing here. It just cycles between the chorus and the verse a few times then ends, so it's only about 2 minutes long.<br />Best Lyric: You're probably right this time but I don't want to listen.<br />6) Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) 15/15<br />Music: Very emotional, with few lyrics because he sings them slowly. The song itself, however, isn't slow. Features an ingenious riff that plays through the song. This song has a groove to it. Another peaceful sounding track. The way it sounds, the lyrics, and the title, make you  feel like you're driving in a car on an open road. It has a music video, but it's not so great.<br />Best Lyric: Now drive me far away. I don't care where just far away...<br />7) Lotion 15/15<br />Music: When I first heard this, I hated it.  Eventually, I heard it enough that I realized how much it rocks.  It's insanely heavy and the tune changes every couple seconds.  Tons of screaming that suddenly breaks into singing during the chorus.  The best part is when he's yelling &quot;I FEEL SICK!&quot; over and over.  Guitar work is AWESOME.<br />Best Lyric: I feel sickened, and who the ---- are you anyway? You suck.<br />8) Dai the Flu 20/15<br />Music: The opening tune will run over and over in your head for hours.  This song has creepy distorted verses with an awesome chorus.  Lyrics are more easily decipherable than usual.  Kind of a ballad, at least until the end, when he starts screaming.  Great example of what this album is like.<br />Best Lyric: Fifteen stitches and a soft parody to make my eyes be like deceit.<br />9) Headup 12/15<br />Music: A real kick in the face.  Not as chaotic as Lotion, but even more screaming.  It even has a little of that classic Deftones choking noise...you'd know what I meant if you heard.  Has something resembling rap in the verses.  Pretty cool chorus, with lyrics that impossible to figure out..  This is even more heavy than most of Adrenaline...  It's also interesting how he chants &quot;Soulfly, fly high, soufly, fly free&quot; because that's the kind thing the band Soulfly is known for singing...Chino is even in one of their songs..check out &quot;Pain&quot; and &quot;First commandment&quot; by them (with Chino).<br />Best Lyric: The spirit's so low it's coming over you.<br />10) MX 15/15<br />Music:  Awesome, simple riff with a slow tempo.  Has a girl saying something in the background during the verses, and some distorted laughing in the chorus.  Doesn't take as long to get used to as the others.  There's plenty of heaviness here, but no screaming.  An awesome finish to an awesome album.  The song is about five minutes, but the track is 37, because there's a hidden track (Damone).<br />Best Lyric: You're a bore, but you move me like a movie that you love.<br />11) Damone 15/15<br />Music: This is the hidden track to MX.  Scary edge.  Very heavy with lots of screaming.  Moves faster than most on the CD; doesn't sound like he's stuck in something sticky and getting pissed and trying to get out, which is the overall atmosphere of the CD.  Mellow verses with emphasis on the drums.  Like a fast version of &quot;Battle-axe&quot; from their new album.  This is just as good as anything else on the album, I don't know why this isn't one of the normal tracks, although I do like how you get more than you plan for when you buy the CD.  Fast forwarding all the way to it is annoying.<br />Best Lyric:  Just smile, stand still while you look right back at me.<br />Go buy this and then pick up all the Deftones other albums (Adrenaline, White Pony, Deftones s/t).<br />Then go check out Mudvayne (the best band in the world), Korn, Static-X, Slipknot, System of a Down, Tool, and anyone else like any of those.etty cool chorus, with lyrics that impossible to figure out..  This is even more heavy than most of Adrenaline...  It's also interesting how he chants &quot;Soulfly, fly high, soufly, fly free&quot; because that's the kind thing the band Soulfly is known for singing...Chino is even in one of their songs..check out &quot;Pain&quot; and &quot;First commandment&quot; by them (with Chino).<BR>Best Lyric: The spirit's so low it's coming over you.<br />10) MX 15/15<BR>Music:  Awesome, simple riff with a slow tempo.  Has a girl saying something in the background during the verses, and some distorted laughing in the chorus.  Doesn't take as long to get used to as the others.  There's plenty of heaviness here, but no screaming.  An awesome finish to an awesome album.

B00000F566|4.0|Even though I was 11 years old when this movie came out in 1987, I knew there was something magical about the story.  What a glorious time during those \\"Wonder Years\\" of the late 80's. So, here you have a movie that takes place in the 60's but uses 80's music during the pivotal scenes.  That is the first strange aspect of this film. This movie proves one thing, and as a white suburban male I can say this with experience and accurate observation: The suburbs are overly predictable, boring, and  the birthplace of aesthetically bland and mind numbing activities as shown in the recreational activity scenes of this movie.<BR>  As a political scientist college graduate, I appreciate the outright class prejudice that this movie teaches us about. You have the White suburban family lead by the following characters: a physician father with all the expectations and prejudies that typically characterize most wealthy suburbanite males , the passive, somewhat attractive but emotional mother, the dumb sexually active sister, and of course Baby, the liberal, soft spoken, and sexually frustrated \\"daddy's girl\\".<BR>  Then you have Patrick Swayze in his breakout homo-erotic role as a bus boy who is the gigolo for Westchester County Socialites who crave slumming with the blue collar crowd. Swayze's character is both the alphamale (as a dancer) and the lost mamma's boy in search of Baby's characer who will fill the void in his life left by the stagnancy of his own lower class existence.  <BR>    So what ultimately is the point of this movie?? Well, rich liberal suburban girls love to dance with blue collar men who make them hot and bothered in ways the country club set could not possibly do on any given Sunday. I love this movie as a guilty pleasure because I am elated when the class lines are blurred and conventional stereotypes are deflated by people with honest emotions and sincere intentions. If Patrick Swayze's character was Black, well then!!!, this would be the movie to beat in all genres because as is well known, the greatest fear of white suburban parents like those portrayed in this movie is that their innocent little girl will get corrupted by the black man with rhythm. So if Swayze's character was black, this movie would not have been the success that it is... thus proving that back in 1987 we were still 1,000 yrs away from meaningful racial tolerance.  Now, I'VE HAD THE TIME OF MY LIFE writing this review.
B00005JM02|4.0|\\"Finding Nemo\\" is another delightful animated movie from Pixar Studios [released through Disney]. Other Pixar creations include \\"A Bug's Life\\", \\"Toy Story\\" and its sequel, and \\"Monsters Inc.\\" Pixar is famous for its awesome digital animation, and \\"Finding Nemo\\" is its best work so far. If there is a flaw, it is simply that this tale is a bit less interesting to adults than Pixar's other movies. It seems specifically aimed at kids aged four to ten. Those who are not fans of Albert Brooks and/or Ellen DeGeneres will be less amused than those who are because it is their voices that carry the bulk of the film.<br />Marlin [voiced by Brooks] is a clown fish who lives in the sea near the coast of Australia. When his wife produces something like two hundred eggs, Marlin is delighted. Catastrophe strikes, and Marlin loses his wife and all but one of the eggs. When the remaining clown fish is born, Marlin names him Nemo. Times passes, and Nemo becomes old enough to go to school. Disaster strikes again when the adventuresome Nemo gets too close to a boat and is caught in a diver's net. The little fish winds up in a fish tank in a Sydney dentist's office. Marlin, aided by an addled fish named Dory [voice of DeGeneres], goes on a quest to find Nemo. Meanwhile, Nemo is befriended by a motley assortment of fish in the tank who have their own escape plans. <br />Adults may find the movie only mildly amusing. Kids will find it uproariously funny. And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with making a great movie for children.
0385504209|5.0|This book fell into my radar when I saw this book on the bestsellers list.  I became curious about the book realizing that the book had topped the chart for many weeks.  I knew nothing about the book at the time but bought it anyway on a whim.  Once I started reading the book I was hooked and read the book practically nonstop and finished the book in a mere 3 days!  It seemed to me that Brown found the formula to write a bestselling novel.  The book has pace and the characters always are on the move which adds to the tension that is always maintained in the book.  But the real formula of this book's success was the mixing of known historical facts and making grandiose implications of conspiracy and adding believability to the story.  Conspiricies regarding DaVinci and his works of art, the conspiracy of the writing of the gospels, and the relations of Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  All of these conspiracies have real elements backed by evidence and yet are not complete to tell the whole picture.  If you are on the way towards buying this book don't forget to visit danbrown.com he's got a couple of webquests that help you kill time as well as promote other books he's published.  It worked on me because I've already purchased a second book written by him.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah McLachlan's star power really peaked in the 6 years SINCE her last studio album, SURFACING, was released.  Several FM hits were spawned, three years of Lilith Fair, a live album, and a huge buzz about her impact on the music scene all followed.  (For long time Sarah fans, this acclaim was overdue).  AFTERGLOW doesn't contain the obvious chart toppers of its predecessors, but has that great Sarah &quot;sound&quot; that will keep it in your CD player long after you buy it.  In my opinion, this CD reminds me more of 1994's FUMBLING TOWARDS ECSTACY in the subtlety of some of the songs' brilliance.  That being said, AFTERGLOW does not hit the heights of FUMBLING or SURFACING, though it is more enjoyable than either TOUCH or SOLACE, her first two CDs.  AFTERGLOW'S first song and single, FALLEN, is dreamy and catchy, albeit depressing.  Very nice video, check it out on VH-1!  WORLD ON FIRE is more upbeat in tempo, though addresses 9/11 so it is hardly a happy song.  STUPID is a standout track, with a memorable chorus that is the closest thing Sarah does to actually yelling - this self-critical song reviews mistakes in a relationship gone bad.  The other standout track I would commend (and hope to hear on the radio) is TIME, with a very catchy and memorable chord progression, and some sobering lyrics regarding a relationship gone sour: (&quot;If I agree, well, it's just to appease you, Cause I don't remember what we're fighting for&quot;).  Other tracks like DRIFTING and TRAIN WRECK are muscially beautiful.  The very spare ANSWER may have benefitted from a little more production.  I suppose what's missing from this album is the heartbreaking urgency of some of Sarah's quieter songs (i.e., FULL OF GRACE, WAIT, HOLD ON) or the obvious power of her more well known songs (POSSESSION, SWEET SURRENDER, BUILDING A MYSTERY).  That being said, I was thrilled to have a CD of 10 new Sarah songs and am confident that they will grow on me the more I listen, and I could see severalof these tracks making it onto radio playlists so that everyone else will be reminded that the 1990s queen of Lilith Fair is back after a hiatus, and not gone forever.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Having read most of the reviews of this album, I am beginning to realize why most artists do not read them.  In short, all of the &quot;music reviewers&quot; that did not enjoy surfacing... did not enjoy this album.  Surfacing sold over 8 million albums... the reviewers do not know what they are talking about.<BR>   Music and Sarah McLachlan is a deeply personal experience.  So, I would advise you to take a listen to this album before you read the reviews. For me, Sarah has once again managed to pour out into song alot of what I happen to be going through at the moment, and listening to her is a comfort I cannot even begin to describe.<BR>   I like every song on this album, but there are a few stand-out songs that deserve to be mentioned. &quot;Fallen&quot; (the album's current single) is probably the most radio-friendly song on the album. It is both haunting and catchy.  &quot;Stupid&quot; is a song that has only gotten better the more I've listened to it. It has a really hard rock grove to it, which breaks up the numerous ballads on the album.  &quot;Answer&quot; is perhaps the most beautiful love song I have ever heard.<BR>   In summary, this album is a continuation of Sarah's body of work and a definate must for any Sarah fan.  For those of you who have heard one or two songs by this artist it will be a welcome relief from the contrived pop hits that have dominated the charts for the last 4 years.  If you are looking for meaningful lyrics, beautiful vocals and great music you will definately find them here.  If you are looking for another bubble gum album by artists who lip sync whenever possible... look elsewhere.
B00006WKSZ|4.0|This is the last album to feature the fantastic Uli Jon Roth on lead guitar. All their classics are here except for Catch Your Train, Sails of Charon and Polar Nights which was transferred to the CD-version of In Trance.<BR>Roth, serious as always about his music and lyrics, left the band after this album because the other members intended to change directions and become a more straight-forward-no-message-included rock act. So if you're the &quot;Roth&quot; kind of person when it comes down to hard rock this is probably the best Scorpions CD on the market. Good sound quality and enthusiastic playing. A pity they didn't leave out the rock 'n' roll medley so Polar Nights could 've been included. And for those who aren't german out there: don't worry about Klaus Meine's english pronunciation on this earlier recording, it's not worse than it is today , haha !
B00004TH7Z|3.0|Not as good as their mid eighties stuff but still pretty good. It's nice to see that Maiden isn't trying to re live their 80's glory, nor are they trying to be Limp Biscuit. Tracks 1-6 are pretty good. &quot;Wicker Man&quot; the title track and &quot;Dream Mirrors&quot; are the best tracks. Out of all the 80's band that are reuniting and putting out new records. Maiden  is one of the few that still making records worth listening to.
B00008PW2D|4.0|While Season 5 was a let down - it wasn't as glamorous as past seasons or as long, it did get down to some issues of being single in the city. Sometimes you are alone for a while and are feeling older and out of it. I thought Anchors Away was one of the funniest episodes they ever did as well. The plot lines for Charlotte and Miranda were pretty strong. The only one who kind of went downhill in this season was Kim Catrell. Sometimes they write the silliest plot lines for her (dying her pubic hair, getting a chemical peel) and don't really show the fact that she can act. <br />I'm also surprised about all the pricing complaints here. Yes, it is not as good of a product as we've had before. But people also pay from 15 - 20 dollars for a cd on average. We're getting two dvd discs for 30 dollars. It's not that big of a deal! I watch my Sex and the City dvd's over and over again so it's worth the price. I'm kind of surprised that they just didn't tack on the six episodes from the other \\"bonus\\" season and have season four be only 12 episodes like the first one, so that way both bonus seasons would give us 14 episodes. But whatever. That's one way to do it. I plan on buying it all the same. <br />So overall, yes this season was a let down. The fashion wasn't as strong before, the plot lines weren't either. But still over all it was good. I recommend it for Sex and the City fans.
B00003CXB4|5.0|From the first moments of the film, as the sun creeps up over the Sarangetti, introducing the audience to the sweeping plains of Africa, there was no question that Disney had created a masterpiece.  The opening song &quot;The Circle of Life&quot; drives the message of the movie home and sets the tone for the entire 90 minute film.<br />Mufasa, king of Pride Rock, and his mate, Sarabi, have given birth to a lion-cub, Simba.  The entire kingdom celebrates his birth, save for Scar, Mufasa's brother, a coniving, manipulative lion whose jealousy of Mufasa's rule drives him to turn against the pride of which he is a part.<br />Simba, curious and anxious to become a lion (&quot;I Just Can't Wait To Be King&quot;), finds himself often getting into trouble, and when spurred on by Scar, heads off to an Elephant graveyard with his future mate, Nala.  Mufasa saves them, but not before the cubs have a close encounter with a pack of mangy hyenas, who have pledged an alliegence to Scar, unbeknownst to Mufasa.  Scar, angry at the hyenas failure to kill the cubs, sets out to destroy Mufasa and Simba both so that he can take the throne (&quot;Be Prepared&quot;).<br />Scar once more deceives Simba, insisting that Mufasa has a suprise for him, by taking him into the middle of a gorge as a pack of wildebeests are sent stampeding when suprised by the hyenas.  Mufasa rushes to Simba's rescue, narrowly pulling Simba from the gorge and taking him to safety before falling back into it himself.  When Mufasa, with his remaining strength, again jumps from the gorge and claws his way up the steep wall, he is met by Mufasa, who betrays him crying aloud &quot;Long live the KING!&quot; before throwing Mufasa back into the cavern, where he is crushed.<br />Later, Simba discovers Mufasa's remains, and Scar approaches, admonishing Simba to leave Pride Rock since it was Simba's actions that killed Mufasa.  Simba, distraught and terrified, does as Scar suggests, and flees, leaving behind Pride Rock unchallenged for Scar to take the throne.<br />Simba, depressed at his father's death, collapses from exhaustion, and is saved from certain doom by Timon and Pumba, who teach him &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot;, which means &quot;No Worries&quot;.  They advise that when the world turns your back on you, you turn your back on the world. Knowing thats not right, but still lost in his own grief, he embraces his new friends advice and ventures off with them, where he grows into a lion.<br />As an adult lion, he saves Pumba from Nala, who has strayed from the pride, which is now in desperate disarry after Scar took the throne, proclaiming to have forged a new alliegence with the Hyenas.  When Nala discovers that Simba is still alive, she is enthralled, because it means Simba is the rightful heir to Pride Rock.  She encourages him to go home, but Simba resists, still feeling the guilt of causing his father's death.  All the same, Nala stays with him, and begins to feel a bond with Simba (&quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot;).<br />In the pivotal moment of the film, Simba meets Rafiki, a wise baboon whose magic has foreseen his return, and is given the wisdom that he must not live in the past, but learn from it, and take his place in the circle of life.  Simba, still unconvinced, is visited by the spirit of his father, who admonishes him to &quot;remember&quot; his place and the wisdom his father once instilled in him.<br />Simba returns to Pride Rock, and, upon confronting Scar, learns the truth-specifically that Scar killed Mufasa, not Simba.  Simba overthrows Scar and reclaims his throne, restoring Pride Rock to the kingdom it once was as he continues the &quot;Circle of Life&quot;.<br />This film features an all star cast:  James Earl Jones, Johnathan Taylor Thomas (of &quot;Home Improvement&quot; fame), Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowin Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Cheech Marin (of &quot;Cheech and Chong&quot; fame), and Jeremy Irons.  With lyrics and music by Tim Rice and Elton John, and additional orchestrations by Hans Zimmer, the music stands alone, and is one of the finest Disney soundtracks ever.  <br />This movie is destined to become a Disney classic.  It is already, arguably, the strongest Disney film in the past 20 years.  It is suitable for all audiences, and has a strong and powerful message for young and old alike.  This is a story about friendship, family and about the parts we all play in the circle of life.  Watch this one again and again.  It is worth the experience, no matter how many times you experience it.<br />Scott Kolecki
B00009TB5G|5.0|I'm not gonna go into a whole review here because I don't wanna be long winded. I loved the theatrical version and knowing how amazing the fellowship of the ring EE was I eagerly awaited this version knowing it would be just as wonderful as fellowship. One year later and I am not dissapointed. There are SO MANY great additional scenes that add alot of more weight to existing scenes. We learn the origin of the horse that saves aragorn. We learn why faramir's first reaction to the hobbits is not as pleasant as in the book series. We learn why he says \\"a chance for faramir to show his quality.\\" It gave me goose bumps. This is the true vision of this film, and as I eagerly await return of the king, I know sadly there is a better version awaiting our eyes next november. Excellent job. Another great film turned into a timeless masterpiece. With the additional 40 minutes the film has time to breathe adding more depth, more laughs, and more heart.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I cannot understand why so many people gave this one a bad review! I watched the Martix and Reloaded several times each before seeing this one and I think this one is the best! It is unbelievably good as an action movie and the special effects are blended in so well it appears to be real! This movie shows our planet and the pods in more detail, which I found fascinating since they just hinted at this in the other films. The first Matrix was about Birth, the second about Life and this one all about Death. You can feel death in the air and it is spooky. All the Matrix movies are so different and all have their own feel. I found myself not believing how good this movie is! The action scenes are reminiscent of Star Ship Troopers very much. The Captains in this movie make the movie with their superior acting and deep love for Zion. Lots of people have to have faith in Neo, since they are so outnumbered by the machines; they stand no chance on their own. They have to believe in miracles and you can see their struggle in doing so. A true battle of the spirit and the questions one must face in believing in more then one can see. But the true heart of this movie is the war. This is an Epic battle and I've never seen such immersive action and excellence in blending computer-generated art with reality so seamlessly. I came away from this movie saying to my husband that this was not only the best matrix, but also the best movie I have ever seen or will ever see in my lifetime. He saw it the next day and agreed with me 100%. Those people that gave it a poor review must see it again!

B000009O8A|4.0|\\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" has a rather remarkable history for an exploitation film. I vividly remember a little video store close to where I lived ten years ago or so placed this film in their adult section, apparently concerned that the disturbing images within were so dangerous that only those interested in the latest Ron Jeremy release could appreciate them. Director Meir Zarchi, a definite one shot wonder if there ever was one, continues to squeeze every drop of coin out of his film as possible. How many different versions of this movie is this guy going to release? A \\"Millennium Edition\\"? Are you kidding me? I have spent some time viewing several of the more extreme entries in the exploitation genre, and I can confidently state that \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" is one of the more milder contributions to that exalted field. If you want to watch something truly mind boggling, track down a copy of Ruggiero Deodato's \\"Cannibal Holocaust.\\" The fact that Zarchi's film got a widespread DVD release while Deodato's little gem remains mired in virtual obscurity constitutes one of the great crimes in the B movie arena. Still, \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" does have a message for those willing to sit down and watch it.<br />In what must have shocked New York filmgoers who screened this exploitation piece in one of the grindhouse theaters in the 1970s, \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" concerns the brutalizing of a young girl from the Big Apple named Jennifer Hill during a sojourn she makes into rural upstate New York in order to write a novel while slumming around in a riverfront cabin. Jenny, played by a very pretty Camille Keaton, almost immediately runs into four local losers when she stops at a gas station near her rented house. These four goons, after learning that one of their gang has never spent time with a woman, arrive at the brilliant idea of launching a full frontal assault on Jennifer. They don't immediately overwhelm her, of course, but rather build up to it by slowly terrorizing her. They cruise by her digs on a noisy motorboat, distracting her from her writing with their hoots and hollers. Our gang of rural cretins finally makes their move when they discover Jennifer out on the river in a little row boat. Using their big, bad powerboat, the gang hijacks the unfortunate lass's vessel and tows her to shore.<br />What follows are several distressing scenes of rape and violence, sequences that drag on for what seems like hours as the gang has their fun, lets Jenny go, and then reappears for more nightmarish activities. After this lengthy degradation finally, mercifully comes to a close, the criminals force one of their crew to go dispatch Hill with a knife. Regrettably, for these tough guys who seek to erase the evidence of their monstrous endeavors, the man they pick to do the deed suffers from a mental disability and cannot muster enough nerve to go through with the ultimate crime. Big mistake. Jennifer recovers from her injuries and begins to plot her revenge against her tormentors. Making good use of that old adage about a \\"woman scorned,\\" Jenny uses her feminine wiles to lure and ultimately murder the four men who committed such nauseating violations. What you would think would provide plenty of gory thrills turns out to be a rather tepid series of revenge killings. One of the men dies when Jenny hangs him from a tree, another in a bathtub when Hill applies a knife to a most cringe worthy area, and the final two in the river. The movie ends with Jenny roaring down the river in a motorboat, seemingly sated by her well laid plans.<br />Several things do actually work in \\"I Spit On Your Grave.\\" The willowy, pretty Camille Keaton lounging around her house at the beginning of the film in her bikini is nice (but definitely not later, when the horror begins), but doesn't inspire me to admire in any way the activities of the men in the film, one of whom eventually tells his victim that she was \\"asking for it\\" because she wore revealing clothing. I canappreciate what Zarchi tried to do with his nasty little shocker: present a picture of rape that is both as realistic as possible and as disturbing as possible. The director does achieve the desired effect, I think, by showing how such a despicable crime degrades everyone involved in it. What didn't work was the mediocre script, especially when Jennifer Hill goes on her vengeful rampage. The fact that these guys willingly went along with a woman they terrorized just two weeks previously seemed amazingly contrived. I am willing to believe these men are stupid, but not THAT stupid. If a woman who suffered such a horrific incident as Jenny did decided to strike back, I think it would probably resemble something like serial killer Eileen Wuornos's rampage rather than \\"I Spit On Your Grave.\\" Women simply don't go on killing sprees against their attackers, and even nowadays often don't report rape to the police.<br />The DVD I watched contained a trailer for the film and a widescreen transfer of the nicely restored picture. \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" is definitely a film with a message and worth watching once, but I recommend renting instead of buying it. If you like viewing Zarchi's film on a regular basis, you probably have some problems that need addressing soon, preferably at a place where nice men in white jackets can introduce you to the wonderful world of Thorazine.an appreciate what Zarchi tried to do with his nasty little shocker: present a picture of rape that is both as realistic as possible and as disturbing as possible.

B00005JMFR|3.0|One thing that stunned me about Revolutions, aside from the fact that it was actually engaging and pretty provocative, were the stereotypical portrayals of so many blacks as people who can't be bothered with grammar.  I found it pretty insulting.  But, with that out of the way, Revolutions actually provides pretty good entertainment.  Perhaps the weakest part of the movie is the dialogue; in fact, it's painfully bad.  Here's what the typical exchange sounds like:  \\"I knew you were coming back.\\"  \\"I know.\\"  \\"Did you know I loved you?\\"  \\"I knew you knew, but I didn't know that you would say that you knew.\\"  \\"I know.\\"  It becomes downright impenetrable blather because of the writers' limited English skills.  There.  Someone needed to say that.<br />The acting is pretty good, but let's face it.  It's hard to act when you're given such mediocre lines.  And what happened to Laurence Fishburne?  He looks bloated, slow, and hesitant.  In fact, he seemed to be hung-over.  Thankfully, his presence in the film is quite limited.  Then there is the infatuation with leather and vinyl.  One might almost suspect a cross-dressing leather fetishist did the custume design, and no one could bring themselves to point out how silly it looks.  (I'm sure in a grungy metropolis just outside the hot core of the Earth sweaty leather will be the clothing material of choice.  Sure.  If not that, PVC vinyl.)<br />What is good about Revolutions is that actually starts saying something interesting about human nature, and the relationship of our own world to the matrix--pointing out, quite effectively, that our world isn't much more than or different from the matrix.  I won't go into much more detail about this thesis, other than to say that it makes for a much more subtle commentary on human relationships and emotions and provides a interesting philosophical bridge between humans and machines.  A lot of the movie is difficult to understand, but a least there is meat to chew on--unlike the pointless and silly Matrix Reloaded.<br />So, there you have it.  Not as good as the original (which didn't try to answer its questions and had a much more compelling and engaging premise), but much better than part two.pointless and silly Matrix Reloaded.<br />So, there you have it.

B00005JLWN|1.0|yes, you are right, it's only a movie, sci-fi one what's more. you are right that sci-fi movies can be unrealistic. but only in terms of let's say technology, advanced science or principals (take startrek for example). but the events still need to be at least a little logical. i mean, come on. especially the lobby fighting scene when he's reloading. there are 10 guys with assault rifles in front of him; it's like he's saying &quot;wait a minute folks, i need to reload so don't shoot&quot;. there are too many contradictions in the main character's behavior... sometimes he behaves like a highly trained killer (that's what he's supposed be right?) and a scene later he turns into a stupid rookie who can't assess a basic combat situation. that's what makes matrix so different, even though the first look might suggest they are equally good. because in matrix (well, leave aside the &quot;beautifull princess kiss of life&quot; at the end) all the characters behave logically in each situation and the jumps and fighting skills are justified by the environment they take place in. that's the kind of realism i'm talking about - not considering 50 meter jump unrealistic. but it seems to me that in equilibrium, the characters take completely irrational and unlogical actions just in order to buy some time for next few scenes - it's like you don't check-mate your opponent in chess when you have a unique chance to do so just in order to play next few moves. but usually chess are not about life/death or fate of the entire city...
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone who likes fish and a great story.  It's the hilarious story of a clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is over protective of his son Nemo (Alexander Gould).  When Marlin runs into the loveable character Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) because she knows where he might be able to find him they run into sharks, turtles, jellyfish, pelicans, a whale and all sorts of other animals.  The only problem is that Dory has a terrible case of short-term memory loss.  As they travel the ocean into the EAC (East Australian Current) they work together to find Nemo who is stuck in a tank at a dentist's office.  Nemo and his new friends in the tank work together to come up with a way to free him before Darla (LuLu Ebeling) comes to pick him up for her birthday present and get him back into the ocean.  It's going to take a lot of planning and courage from both Marlin and Dory to find their way to the dentist's office and from Nemo and his friends to escape the tank and the clutches of Darla.  In the end, will Nemo find his way back into the ocean where he can reunite with his father or will he end up going home with Darla as her birthday present?<br />This is a must buy for anyone who likes Disney and especially Pixar fans.  It is sure to be an instant classic to be watched over and over again.  The DVD extras include the great short film Knick Knack with audio commentary and 5 or 6 virtual aquariums you can turn your TV into.  The DVD also includes documentaries on putting this film together, which are amazing and makes you realize how much time and effort is put into making a digitally animated film look so real.  There are 2 discs, one disc has the windscreen version of the film and the other has the full screen version, both with tons of DVD extras.<br />In all go buy this movie, it's one of the best Pixar movies made, and you won't regret it!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Rock has become such a broad category today that not one band can single handedly become the &quot;Kings of Rock&quot;. People make the mistake by comparing The Strokes, The Vines, The Hives etc. to some ultimate rock band that will become the savior of modern music. If you're looking for the next Nirvana or the next Beatles, then you will become disappointed. But as long as you appreciated the bands for what they do, rather than what you expect them to do, then you will be satisfied. I know that a big appeal of the Strokes are that they are hip and trendy, but there's also much to admire about the music. They have a non-chalant, emotionless apporach to their music that contrasts with present band's blatant attempts to copy Cobain's energy and honesty. Julian Casablancas writes about those moments that are neither profound or paramount, but make up a large potion of our lives (going out on a date, getting drunk at a party etc.) and the intrumentals are genius in their mix of simplicity and melody. The sound is a kind of distorted beauty, much like a Picasso painting. If you weren't educated you might look at an Andy Warhol painting and think that there's nothing to see. Same thing applies to a Strokes song. Once again, The Strokes aren't going to be saviors of rock. Stop expecting more, and just take a look at what is offered. <br />notable tracks:<BR>12:51- the catchiest tune. Nick's synthesizer is perhaps the most flavorful instrumental in the album<br />under control: very motown-like. laid back and smooth.<br />reptilla: there is an inriuging amount of tension that builds up in this track.<br />The end has no end: a genius mix of varying pieces of music. I consider it to have three different choruses.

As a 16 year old girl, I loved this book at the time, though I'm sure now years later, the misogyny might irk me.  Nonetheless, this book raised so many interesting debates about free will and human morality, I would urge everyone to read it.

The overt sexuality was overdone, considering the right audience for the story, or more correctly, stories, is not likely to be the type of audience to appreciate the soft porn. It interferes with the lightness of the movie, pulling the audience from their relaxed dreamy states to one of irritation, and it was all unnecessary.<BR><br />The cast and music were the biggest saving graces of this film.

B00007G207|1.0|Sorry, i know a lot of people adore this film, but it made me slightly nauseous.  It tugs so relentlessly at the heartstrings that it got on my nerves frightfully.  Cute little boy who adores cinema, gruff but kindly old man who befriends him, boy saves old man's life in fire and ends up doing his job, crikey, all it needs to complete it is a lovable hairy dog.  Also I was shocked that when the boy leaves home he never comes back once to see his mother in 30 years.  What kind of a son is he?  He could have come back to see his mother on her birthday at least, or for Christmas.  I thought Italian men were supposed to be nice to their mothers.  Disgraceful.  This film kept on trying to make me cry, but I remained resolutely dry-eyed.  I prefer films that make me laugh anyway.

B00007G207|2.0|I just rented this film last night, and didn't realize it was the &quot;New&quot; Cinema Paradiso.  As you know, this is the director's cut, and has EVERYTHING in it, which is probably more than you want.  The story is much different, even a bit disturbing, whereas the original cut was much more charming, and loveable.  <br />In this new version we learn about everything, including how the adult Toto stalks his childhood girlfriend's modern-day daughter (who is protrayed by the same actress who played his original love interest).  He finds the daughter's home and sees her drive off with his old friend (the one he beat to the punch in the original encounter with Elena) who is now obviously the young girl's father.  <br />He realizes this is the home of his now married, Elena.  He stalks the house and gets the nerve to call his long lost girlfriend.  They have a private meeting and finally make love for the first time in his car (after waiting 30 years).  <br />He continues to be creapy with her for a few more days and finally goes on his way to embrace his now clearly pathetic life of as a single, loney adult who waited his whole life for nothing.<br />Sorry if my spoiler here spoils your view of the movie, but I recommend you buy the original cut and continue to enjoy the story you loved in 1990.  Besides this issue, the new cut is so long, you really just get to a point where you want it to end.<br />Hope this helps.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|It is a fact about sequels - almost all of them dont live up to the originality and quality of their predecessor. Perhaps this is simply because the first is the first and the second and third are no longer introducing a new idea or concept. Therefore, it is very difficult to have the audience more surprised and amazed by the second and third.<br />Although the Matrix Reloaded is a sequel to a great and hard to beat original, it is still a very refreshing and entertaining sequel that pretty much lives up to its hype. Plenty of great fight scenes, as there were in the first Matrix, make Reloaded a fun ride from beginning to end. Having just seen the third(Matrix Revolutions) of the Matrix trilogy,which was very good but was my 3rd favorite of the 3,i can say that the Matrix Reloaded was definately a close second best to the original. The Matrix Reloaded is definately a worthy buy - you will want to at least watch these fight scenes many times - so you dont want to waste your money renting the movie over and over again. The DVD also comes with a bonus disc, with some interesting extra features about Reloaded to check out.
0156029065|3.0|Just finished reading Baudolino, by Umberto Eco.  It was good enough that I kept reading through to the end, but rather disappointing compared to The Name Of The Rose or Foucault's Pendulum.  Baudolino is a poor simple peasant who is picked up by a king and uses his wits to survive.  The book is a story of his exploits during the middle ages, as he uses lies and storytelling to alter the course of history.  Eventually, Baudolino forms alliances with other liars, and they run off on a quest that increasingly resembles a Breugel painting.  &quot;Rose&quot; and &quot;Pendulum&quot; both deal with themes of faith, devotion, love, and mystery, which is perhaps part of their appeal.  Baudolino, on the other hand, is a rather crass and materialistic fellow who wears his religion only because of expedience and social obedience.  The book attempts at time to give Baudolino some depth, but he comes across as rather shallow and unsympathetic.  The book gets smugly preachy at times, seeming to delight in ever-greater examples of how history itself may be a lie, religious extremism is dangerous, and so on -- but without a very sympathetic or believable charater, the preaching gets boring.
B000002LCK|5.0|With the death of Ian Curtis, everything ground to a halt for Joy Division. Unable to continue in the vein of songs like \\"Komakino\\" and \\"Decades,\\" unable to embark on their American tour, unsure of where to go after this sudden catastrophe, but unwilling to just give up music and disappear, at that time the remaining members of the band could only finish what was already started; their first release as New Order was the single \\"Ceremony\\" with B-side \\"In a Lonely Place.\\" These are Ian Curtis' last poems, and the music for them had already been written, but Joy Division had not had time to release them, and so they came out under the New Order name with Bernard Sumner on vocals. Sumner doesn't do a bad job, really, bringing just the right restraint to them, but all he succeeds in doing is making Curtis' absence felt. Amidst the tender serenity of \\"Ceremony\\" and the haunted plains of \\"In a Lonely Place,\\" not hearing Ian's familiar voice is heartbreaking. Needless to say, among Joy Division's followers these songs have attained the status of lost treasures. The most valuable aspect of the big Joy Division box set Heart and Soul is the presence of two low-fidelity rehearsal recordings of these very songs, filled with tape hiss, ending abruptly, but with Ian on vocals. For New Order, however, this was only a first step.<br />The Everything's Gone Green EP is the sound of New Order's road back from Joy Division's sound. The dance elements are there already - the jumping, processed synthesizers in the title track and \\"Procession\\" - but Sumner's singing still carries traces of Curtis. Due to this, the songs still hint at the striking beauty Joy Division had glimpsed, but Sumner's lyrics are really fairly inexpressive, though Peter Hook's bass in \\"Procession\\" sounds like many early Joy Division songs (\\"The Kill\\" in particular). Even New Order's breakthrough \\"Blue Monday\\" still retains enough of Joy Division in it to make one think Ian Curtis might start singing any moment, despite sounding already fundamentally different.<br />It's \\"Temptation\\" where New Order really became New Order - some loud drums, a keyboard undercurrent, a warm and memorable guitar jangle, and of course, Sumner's affectionate singing, filled with irrepressible joy at simply being alive even while \\"bolts from above hit the people down below.\\" New Order's main theme is born here - Sumner hints that his life might just have undergone some sort of upheaval, but cares not a bit about it, asserting simply, \\"I'll find myself as I go home.\\" His songs often have a solitary air, but find that solitude to be a cause for happiness. After all, when one goes outside and sees a beautifully clear winter day, with frost on the ground but nary a cloud in the sky, who really cares about angst, problems, and anything other people might have done?<br />A few more songs, a few more milestones - \\"Confusion\\" uses scratching and gruff hip-hop-style backing vocals, \\"Thieves Like Us\\" features keyboards as a lead instrument, but \\"The Perfect Kiss\\" tops all of them. Sumner sings an ambiguous, strange song about danger and disenchantment (with a chorus that affirms his belief in \\"a land of love,\\" of course) to a masterful, layered rhythm track, and at the song's very end, there's a veritable explosion of sound, as the celestial lead thunders up and down over Hook's rolling waves of bass. A more spontaneous expression of carefree delight is difficult to imagine.<br />Themes of danger and crime run through \\"Subculture,\\" \\"Shellshock\\" and \\"State of the Nation,\\" but Sumner is no malicious outsider, but more of a seeker of harmless thrills who favours a pleasant walk about town at night. It's hilarious to hear him assert that \\"Another day goes by and ALL I do is cry\\" in a completely non-lachrymose tone of voice. It's \\"True Faith,\\" however, that is the pinnacle of the first disc, and doubtless a pinnacle of the genre. Sumner returns to his favourite theme, singing with great warmth about waking up tosee the \\"morning sun.\\" Lost human connections and uncertainty about the future are addressed with the lines \\"That's the price that we all pay\\" and \\"I guess there's just no way of knowing,\\" respectively, and nothing more is made of them. This is what every great New Order song always comes back to - the simple realization that the morning sun, observed in solitude, is exactly what happiness is, and everything else can be disposed of with absolute calm.<br />The second disc, aside from featuring \\"In a Lonely Place\\" and the rest of the Everything's Gone Green EP, doesn't have as much to offer. Five of the tracks on it are remixes of songs from the first disc, and of these, only \\"Shame of the Nation\\" is interesting, since it's not an instrumental remix but actually an entirely different take on the song that strips away the noisier moments and adds unintentionally funny backing vocals. However, the disc also contains the gorgeous \\"Lonesome Tonight,\\" a winsome song that steers closer to the \\"rock\\" end of New Order's dance-rock scale than anything else on the album, as well as the dense instrumental \\"Murder\\" and the dramatic, compelling \\"1963.\\" The last of these is especially great, showing Sumner's storytelling as well as vocal talents.<br />Substance is an excellent album, a perfect introduction to New Order for those unfamiliar with them, a fine compilation for fans (only four songs on here can be found on studio albums, though their Substance versions are significantly different), a document of the completely unexpected, triumphant rebirth of an already great band, and a landmark in both rock and roll and dance music (soon to become electronica). It's creative, infectious, and above all a lot of fun (how else could one describe moments like the ending of \\"The Perfect Kiss,\\" really?). It isn't Joy Division, but nothing is.
B0000073BG|5.0|I was introduced to this band about 30 years ago and have never ceased to be amazed at how Annie Haslam's voice effects me.  I can close my eyes and take trips to faraway places and forget the hassles of my day.  The band is solid and backs her up with power and precision matched by a few bands in existence.  My opinion is that Renaissance is one of a rare breed of band with talent and depth and true lasting power.  To Annie, John, and the rest.  You will always be the band that takes me on the best journies of mind and heart.  May your music last forever.  The only thing that would be better for me is if you came out with a DVD of videos.  Then I know I would be in heaven.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I loved this movie. I think I really appreciate the fact that some of the women weren't little stick figures that are unrealistic. I also enjoyed that there were several love stories into one.Yes it was the typical love story but it all connected into a creative movie. I haven't seen this good of a romance comedy in a long time. I was very impressed with the taste of the whole movie. I really felt like I could relate. It also has an awesome soundtrack.
0446530573|4.0|As a huge Sopranos fan, I bought this book more for the editorial content than the recipes.  What a fun surprise to find that this is actually a great cookbook, in addition to a wonderfully funny addendum to the series.  The &quot;Sunday Gravy&quot; is a particular favorite, and soon to become a staple in our house.  Enjoy!
B00005JMFO|5.0|I saw Love Actually this past weekend on a whim. I had not heard of it previous to this occasion; however, I could not be happier that I did. Not only is the cast stellar, with the talents of Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant, but the plot is also one of the most multi-faceted and well-conceived in a film that I have ever seen, with a clever sense of humor that didn't have to try too hard to be funny. This movie captures the essence of relationships between a group of adults of varying ages and stations in life, exploring what really makes love--and life--tick. I walked into the theater expecting to be entertained for two and a half hours, which I was, but I also walked out with a new favorite film. Anyone who wants to see a funny, sweet movie this holiday season, go see Love Actually. You will not regret it!
B00000G3PA|1.0|This movie epitomizes Hollywood's love affair with fluff over substance. This whole film is so glossy, so formulaic, and so utterly empty that it's really quite extraordinary in its vapidity. The marketing tie-in with Aerosmith smacks of additional cynical money-grubbing. The visual style in particular is laughable and shameful: one second, it looks like an MTV video, the next a car commercial.<br />Avoid if you want to respect yourself in the morning.
B000067CQK|3.0|It would get 5 stars for the music alone but the packaging brings it to 3. As a previous reviewer pointed out the CD booklet is ready to rip out. ( I bought it at a local retailer and after returning the first and opening 5 more copies at the return desk I selected the least damaged and put clear tape on to avoid further damage).
B00005JMFR|1.0|Ok, this movie sucked for a number of reasons.  Hello, where is the plot?  Didn't you forget something, like a story that made sense?  So what happens in the end?  Peace?  Peace of what?  It clearly showed all the little human embryos still in their little embryos.  Maybe the ones in Zion just get left alone below the earth mid their rubble...that is a happy ending alright...  And who is that little Indian girl?  How sweet that she makes sunrises and sunsets I suppose, but who cares? What happened to her parents?  Are they still locked in?  And what about Frenchy?  Is Neo dead or alive?<br />And what was the point in killing Trinity?<br />Only good actor was Smith who is always good no matter what crap he is doing~<br />Did Neo even have a story line?  I can't remember it, except he didn't get to eat any cookies...<br />Too weird... See Brother Bear instead.
B000089RVR|4.0|Wow, this a great album. I got Dido's first album a year or two ago for one song and fell in love with the whole album. Her voice is just so beautiful and I really appreciate a lot of her attitudes toward life.  She's very free and that often is a breathe of fresh air in the world we live. <BR>Anyways, got the second album not expecting too much, and it blew me away. I love the cd. No need to fast-forward any tracks. My favorite track has got to be Life for Rent - the title track. It's got an excellent message and a catchy tune. <BR>I encourage you to go and get this album if you've liked any of her stuff. You'll love it. A lot of people are scared of buying a chic/pop album because it just doesn't look so macho, but hey - what's music really for? Enjoyment or status? You take your pick. But go for it if you like her.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have to admit,,When I first listen to this cd, I felt a bit dissapointed...the songs all seemed soft and slow. Nothing seemed to be easily accessible, with the Fallen being an exception.. But after listening, I discovered more to this whole album.  Yes, this is different than her previous, but that is good!  Change is good, and these songs show a maturity that some artist never aquire.  I hate buying a new cd from an artist I enjoy and it sounds the same.  These songs are all beautiful and now I love this album.  The title Afterglow is apt, for these songs leave a warm, quiet feeling in your soul.  Don't give up on this one just because it takes some time to enjoy.   Best songs, in my opinion, World on Fire, Stupid and Time.  Though I could find something to love on each song
0792841344|4.0|Gruesome, quirky and highly inventive low budget horror film from the late 1970's has definitely achieved cult status amongst terror aficionado's , spawning multiple sequels over the past quarter century, and a legion of loyal fans to the battle between good &amp; evil at Morningside Funeral Home. Young director Don Coscarelli's horror cheapie was a surprise hit globally in 1979, and like other inventive low budget horror films \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", it has become a pillar outlining the trends of modern horror movies of the past 25 years.<br />( Interestingly, Coscarelli's celluloid life has been virtually consumed by \\"Phantasm\\", in much the same way as George Romero's onscreen output has been dominated by the \\"Living Dead\\" since 1968. Coscarelli has directed all the subsequent sequels to the original \\"Phantasm\\" !! )<br />Innovative, and often humorous plot has two orphaned brothers ( Mike &amp; Jody ) , and their ice cream selling buddy ( Reggie ) investigating unusual phenomenon at the nearby Morningside Cemetery. Mike witnesses all manner of strange happenings including malignant, grunting dwarfs ( looking suspiciously like Jawa's from \\"Star Wars\\" ), a stunning lady in lavender wooing amorous males to their death, and a deadly chrome sphere that drills the brains out of those unfortunate enough to forget to duck !!<br />The gatekeeper ( literally ) to all this evil, is the Tall Man....a malevolent alien robbing the graveyard's of recently deceased to supply bodies for his nefarious purposes.<br />This DVD package is excellent value with a wonderful introduction by the Tall Man ( Angus Scrimm ) to a top quality print of the feature film. In addition, there is an insightful audio commentary with the director and all key cast members, deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage with commentary, TV &amp; theatre trailers, TV interviews, a booklet.....and much, much more !!<br />When \\"Phantasm\\" was released in Australia in 1979 the distributors changed the film's name to \\"The Never Dead\\". And the reason why ??? Well, in 1977 a soft porn film with plenty of onscreen nudity was made &amp; released in Australia with the title \\"Fantasm\\" ! And the distributors of \\"Phantasm\\" in Australia obviously did not want horror fans accidently walking into the wrong theatre.....<br />Arguably, \\"Phantasm\\" hasn't aged brilliantly since it's initial release in 1979, and it looks quite hokey in some places by current horror standards. However, the film's raw unpolished style and it's effective combination of a truly eerie soundtrack, believable heroes, a dominating onscreen villain and scarey jolts combined with injections of humor still make it an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes. Fans of modern horror should have this imaginative film in their inventory !!stributors changed the film's name to \\"The Never Dead\\". And the reason why ???

B00005JMFO|5.0|I knew this film would be amazing even before I went to see it!  The cast were top rate (Hugh Grant, Colin Firth AND Alan Rickman in one film!) and the director has previously written the hits Four Weddings, Notting Hill & Bridget Jones!  I have to admit though, that to get all the jokes being a Brit (which I am) helps.  The one scene that made me laugh (but no one else in the movie theatre) was the bit when the aged rock star is interviewed by Ant & Deck, two v. famous kids TV presenters.  In the background is a HUGE pic of the pop group Blue, which he defaces with some offensive comments about their manhood! Hilarious!<br />This is one the girls will love (my man wouldn't come with me), and the romance coupled with the Christmas overtones will put you in a good mood for at least a couple of days!<br />SEE IT!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I have listened to the cd over and over and I can't stop.  It's a great cd, her lyrics are great, the music enigmatic, and her voice is mesmerizing!  I have waited over 5 years for this cd and it really was worth it.  Sarah has delivered a great album that holds true to her art.  I am so glad that she didnt change her music to be something she's not.  If you liked FTE and Surfacing, you will love this one.  It is a bit softer, but it is as touching if not more than her previous work.  Put the cd in and put on your headphones.  Grab the lyrics and just follow along as it plays.  That is the way to appreciate this music and really GET what make's it great!  <BR>Some personal fav's:...<BR>1 - Train Wreck (absolutely the best!  I love her!)<BR>2 - Fallen <BR>3 - Answer<BR>4 - Stupid <BR>5 - Perfect Girl
B00005JMFO|5.0|As I write this review and look at the calendar, I wonder why, for once, I am not dreading the arrival of the holidays.  I usually do not look forward to them with all their chaos, confusion and tiresome ceremonies.  And yet, after recently seeing \\"Love Actually,\\" I suddenly have changed my tune!<br />This is a testament to what is truly one of the finest Christmas films of all time.  \\"Love Actually\\" is shamelessly touching and endearing. It takes chances and liberties with its plot all the time, but it is done so well and acted so credibly that it all comes together perfectly.<br />That excellent acting is brought to you by some of England's (and the world's!) top actors: Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth & Alan Rickman (to name just 5!!!).  While it's amazing to have all these A-list stars in one film, what's even more impressive is that there is no one star, per se.  This is an ensemble piece in the truest sense of the word.<br />Brought to us by the same folks that brought classics like FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL & BRIDGET JONE'S DIARY, this film contains the same type of offbeat, oddly touching and sometimes dicey British humor.<br />Critics may claim that the film is uneven, too sugary-sweet, and too mature to be the ideal \\"feel-good holiday film\\" it strives to be. But all this is neither here nor there.<br />LOVE ACTUALLY is the ideal Christmas gift for one and all.  You will leave the theater with a warm, fuzzy feeling that no other film in recent memory will leave you with.<br />In short, this is a Romantic/Holiday comedy done the way only the Brit's could do it- oddball, screwy, offbeat and thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.
B000089RVX|3.0|This disc is refreshingly different from much mainstream rock, and has several good tracks.  Unfortunately, the best tracks off of this disc have been played over, and over, and over again on radio, and television.  So if you watch tv or listen to the radio you've already heard most of what this disc has to offer.<br />The three quality songs on this album are:  Going under, Bring me to life (both played seemingly continuously on the radio the past several months), and tourniquet (which is a good track, but sounds quite a bit like the first two mentioned.)<br />It's not a terrible disc - the three songs mentioned above are GOOD songs, but beyond that the album doesn't have anything else to offer.  So if you have a radio, you really don't need this cd.
B0000025D0|5.0|He would have been hard-pressed to outshine Bruce Springsteen.  I first bought this LP in 1978, as a 16 year-old, on the strength of having loved \\"Born To Run.\\"  The mood shift is clear from the opening track, perhaps my favorite rock 'n' roll song:  \\"Badlands.\\"  Coming out when it did - 1978 - with factories closing all around my native Detroit, malaise gripping the country, hostages taken in Iran the next year, et cetera, this work combined songs mixing equal measures of hope and despair.<BR>     As another reviewer noted, this was also the first rock 'n' roll album I heard dealing with adult themes - from the fantastical workd of the Magic Rat, et al, on \\"Born To Run\\" to flesh-and-blood Joes and Janes trying to keep hope alive, this was a new experience, and a necessary one, as oldies about going to the Hop do not speak to the realities of adult life.<BR>     More than any other LP, this one deals with how the artist relates to his father.  Count the number of serious songs dealing with father-child relationships in contemporary music - they are rare.  \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\" and \\"Factory\\" are clearly attempts to come to terms with his father - like many men of his generation, a soul whose life revolved around supporting a family by doing brutal, drudge work, with nothing to hope for except making it in one piece to the next day (\\"Through the mansions of fear/Through the mansions of pain/Watch my Daddy walk through them factory gates in the rain\\").  The former also reveals that something in catechism must've stuck, because the track is bathed in Christian imagery - in some places more subtly than in others (\\"...You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past\\").<BR>   After not hearing any of the songs in 20 years (and Springsteen is rarely on the radio - then usually \\"Born In The USA\\" or \\"Born To Run\\"), I bought \\"Darkness\\" on cassette to have something to keep me awake while driving my 'big, old Buick'- and the raw emotional power of every song, sung as though he meant every word, autobiographically perhaps, struck me again, just as it had in 1978.  After 25 years, in a post-9/11 world, with factories closing all around my native Detroit (and elsewhere), perhaps that's more than just a coincidence.<BR>     I'll second the reviewer who said that if he had to own one rock 'n' roll CD, that it would be \\"Darkness.\\"<BR>-Lloyd A. Conway<BR>P.S.  After 25 years, I still believe in the Promised Land

With Julia Roberts as Vivian Ward  playing as a prostitute.  Richard Gere as Edward Lewis a very successful wealth man.  Edward pays for Vivian's services for a week.  You will just have to watch the movie to see what the out come of the movie is.  \\"Pretty Woman\\" is a great comedy, classic movie.  Great for any adult to enjoy.<br />Julia Roberts and Richard Gere work good together.  With both bringing such good acting to their movies.  \\"Pretty Woman\\" and \\"Run Away Bride\\" both starring Roberts and Gere are great movies.  Both Roberts and Gere out do themselves in both movies.  I would recommend any of Julia Roberts or Richard Gere movie's for any adult.<br />\\"Pretty Woman\\" is one of the greatest romantic movies made.  With Roberts and Gere they just seems to be a perfect pair.  They seem to work great together.  <br />I give \\"Pretty Woman\\" a 5 star because, it is a really great movie that anyone could enjoy.

0385504209|5.0|I thought this was an amazing read. Many of you avid readers - I'm sure- thought this to be a predictable story, however, those of us who have never read Dan Brown would agree that it was a page turner.<br />Many years ago I read Holy Blood, Holy Grail and found it difficutl to follow because of the all the detail and historical facts. Tying to piece it all together was not easy; so when I read The Da Vinci Code it put all that information in the form of a story. This is what I totally enjoyed.<br />I was also able to follow up all this stuff on the internet and found a plethora of information about the Kights Templar, The Priory of Sion etc. This book has made me question my own faith and confirmed many of my beliefs.<br />Some have said that Dan Brown's previous books have been better, but having never read Dan Brown - I thought this book was awesome.<br />I recommend this to anyone who has a penchant for religion and knowledge.

Just remembering the music, all the action...WOW.<br />The Platinum Version is going to be spectacular, I hope. Well, that's all...
B00006IUL7|5.0|Robin Williams plays a great serious role as a slightly crazed novelist who kills a teenage girl in a small town in Alaska.  Al Pacino is the big city cop from Los Angeles brought up to catch him.<br />The town, Night Mute, is the Halibut Fishing Capital of the world, but with its picturesque granite mountains in the backdrop, it looks as though the movie was shot in a larger version of Yosemite National Park, one of the most beautifully breathtaking places in the entire world.<br />Pacino solves the mystery early but kills his partner by accident in the process - and the killer sees him do it.  What ensues is a subtle mating dance where two spiders, Williams and Pacino, face off against each other.  One is going to die (probably) and the other is going to get screwed (just figuratively).<br />The pretty girl who is killed is shown in flashback, and there isn't any skin in the entire flick, except if one counts her nude figure lying dead across the coroner's table.<br />Hilary Swank plays a great role as a bushy tailed rookie cop who idolizes Pacino, but then at the end sees him as the human being that is all of us.<br />The mental sparing between Williams and Pacino makes the film come alive - even though with the Alaskan 24-hour days Pacino isn't able to sleep throughout the entire film.  <br />The movie builds to a climactic finish, and you won't be able to either (sleep, that is!).  Pacino, as an experienced, cop is in his element.  But Williams, as the villain, is superb!    `Insomnia' is a feature you'll love from start to finish.  I highly recommend it!
B00008H2LB|3.0|I approached this one with a certain amount of apprehension. I heard their first album about a month before it dropped; being a DJ has its perks. I knew from that first listen that they were going to be big. I had no idea that they would be as big as they were. When your debut sells 10 million and is the best-selling album for a year, spending 50-some weeks in the top 10, you definitely set a standard. Pressure? A little. Sophomore slump? Not here.<br />A lot of people hate this band because they are so popular. Since the one thing they didn't have to worry about is being labeled a sellout, they had a clean slate with which to create Meteora. And create they did. Rather than commercialize their sound, they took the fundamental elements from first album and mined them even further. And to keep things fresh, they definitely brought some things to the table that you would've never heard on Hybrid Theory.<br />The one thing that differentiates LP from many other bands in the genre is their ability to write big fat catchy hooks. How many times did you walk around singing, \\"Crawling in my skin...\\" Love it or hate it, it sticks with you. So it was probably a good move to keep that, although, it does get a little predictable on certain cuts.<br />As for tracks that standout, well, let's start with the first single, \\"Somewhere I Belong\\"; it's one of the least inspired songs on the album and when you listen to the album in its entirety, it becomes inevitable that \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" was going to be the single. It was safe. Other songs that don't really stretch things too much include \\"Easier to Run\\", which could have been called \\"In the End: Part II\\", and \\"Numb\\", which could've been called \\"Crawling: Part II\\". (Incidentally \\"In the End\\" and \\"Crawling\\" are two songs on my list of Songs I Liked at One Time But Make Me Want to Puke in My Shoes When I Hear Them Now. The interesting sidebar to that story is that LP is the only band on that list with two songs. Other songs include\\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".)<br />Discarding those tracks, the rest of the album is pretty good. \\"Hit the Floor\\" is as close as LP comes to bone-crunching. \\"Breaking the Habit\\" brings a nice drum n bass feel with some strings over the top. And the Japanese flute sample in \\"Nobody's Listening\\" is infectious. It would be fantastic if any of those songs became the next single. But in a Justin Timberlake world, though, I doubt it will happen.<br />Upon the 5th or 6th listen, especially in headphones, one thing becomes very, very clear. No other band in this genre spends as much time working on production as LP. They use ProTools and they know how to use them. Some of the production elements wouldn't be missed if they were never there, but you get the sense that the song is simply the starting point for these guys. I, for one, appreciate the effort that goes into that kind of work. Sure, there is something to be said for lo-fi, but when you hear this band work this music this way, the production alone almost becomes as much of the listening experience as the song. Extra props to veteran mixman, Andy Wallace, for recognizing that and keeping it in the forefront.<br />Only real gripe about the album, and this is minimal, is that the broken-hearted torment that keeps creeping in gets stale. They are not as gloriously pathetic as Stabbing Westward and that is the kind of conviction that is need to pull that style off. After a few listens, I just want to play them the line from the (hed) pe song \\"Boom (How You Like That)\\" that reads: \\"Don't get mad, get high, go get even/ Go get yo s**t back, and tell that lyin' ho you leavin'\\". Keep it a little more dangerous, Chester.<br />The CD also comes with a CD-ROM that features of the art of Meteora. It's a 17-minute documentary that reveals a lot about this band. LP makes a conscious effort to make artistic statements in whatever respect they can reach fans. They may be on a major label, but they probably have more integrity than most indy bands. <br />Wrap up: it's safe to say that you will be seeing a lot of Linkin Park for a long time to come. I really feel that these guys have the potential and outlet to reach a level of popularity enjoyed by Metallica and Van Halen. They are revolutionary in a whole new way that, sad to say, the last generation just doesn't get. Hell, I'm still 20-something and I'm barely grasping it, but it sure is exciting.

0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, follows society's elite through the trials and tribulations of love, pride, money, and marriage negotiations.  This novel takes place in 19th century England and revolves around the slow development of love found between two characters.  The first of these characters is Elizabeth Bennet, a clever, beautiful, and spirited young woman.  Pride and Prejudice begins, when Mrs. Bennet asks Mr. Bennet to call on their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Bingley has an income of 5 thousand pounds a year and is not married, so Mrs. Bennet hopes to marry one of her 5 daughters to him.  Jane, the eldest daughter, and Mr. Bingley begin to like each other during a ball.  Elizabeth, the second oldest, meets Mr. Darcy at the same ball.  Darcy initially does not care for Elizabeth, and refuses to even dance with her.<br /> However, as Elizabeth grows to dislike Darcy, Darcy starts to become very fond of her.  She and Darcy meet again when she stays with Mr. Bingley, because her sister, Jane, has taken ill at their house.  Ms. Bingley, the sister of Mr. Bingley, herself hopes to wed Darcy, and seeks to make Elizabeth less appealing to Darcy.  After Jane's recovery she and Elizabeth return home.  There they welcomed to their home by their cousin Mr. Collins, who, because of the inheritance customs of the times (the Bennet girls had no brothers), was the heir to the Bennet family home.  Together, Elizabeth and her family travel to town, where they met Mr. Wickham.  Mr. Wickham notices Elizabeth, who he found charming, and describes to her a terrible deed he alleges Darcy had committed against him.  Wickham claimed that Darcy owed him money and had denied him of a promised avocation.  This new information causes Elizabeth to despise Darcy even more.<br /> Soon Mr. Collins, the rather odd clergyman, proposes to Elizabeth.  To her mother's dismay, she refuses him.  Instead, her friend Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins, and Elizabeth goes to visit them and their neighbor the great Lady Catherine De Bourgh.  During her stay Elizabeth sees Darcy again, and he proposes.  Elizabeth refuses, reciting all the terrible things he had done, including the mistreatment of Wickham.  In response, Darcy writes Elizabeth explaining how Wickham had tried to elope with his sister because of her money. Elizabeth is forced to rethink, her opinions relating to Darcy and Wickham.<br />That summer Elizabeth traveled to Pemberly on holiday with her aunt and uncle, and while there her aunt and uncle wanted to see the beautiful Darcy estate.  While visiting, Darcy showed up.  Darcy and his sister heartily welcomed Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, and invited them to dinner.  Elizabeth began to grow fonder of  Darcy.  Dreadful news arrived during Elizabeth's stay at Pemberly.  Her frivolous younger sister Lydia had run off with Wickham.  Upon learning of the circumstances, Darcy sought out and found Wickham and Lydia, forcing them to marry.  Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle returned to the Bennet home.<br />Bingley and Darcy together visited the Bennet household to call upon Jane and Elizbeth.  Jane became engaged to Bingley, and when Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, her heart had changed, so she said yes.  Elizabeth had fallen in love Darcy.  They had both seen past their pride and past the prejudices that they had learned from society.  Elizabeth and Darcy were happy in marriage, and remained forever grateful to Elisabeth's aunt and uncle for uniting them.<br />I would recommend the book Pride and Prejudice.  It forces each of us to think about our roles in life.  The novel also makes us think about our own pride and our own prejudices against others, and the need for us to learn more about people before we judge them.  This book is also one of the greatest Romances of all time, bringing to life the love that a man and a woman held for each other from another era.  It provides meaningful messages that all of us should learn.  The charactersare also interesting. This book is good for people who understand the use of language in the 19th century.  Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel that I love, and believe everyone would enjoy.
B0000549B0|5.0|&quot;Harvey&quot; is the tale of elegant congenial gentleman, Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) whose best friend just happens to be a six foot, 3 inch white rabbit named Harvey. Naturally, Elwood?s family thinks he's a few carrots shy of a salad. After thoroughly, but unintentionally humiliating his two spinster aunts, Veta (Josephine Hull) and Myrtle (Victoria Horne) at a social gathering, the two plot to secretly have Elwood committed to a sanitarium for psychiatric evaluation. However, upon visiting the sanitarium with Veta, Elwood meets Dr. Sanderson (Charles Drake) and the administering nurse, Miss Kelly (Peggy Dow) who mistake Veta for their patient and promptly usher her off to a padded cell, leaving Elwood free to roam the grounds, then plot as to how he can create the ideal environment for Miss Kelly and Dr. Sanderson to fall in love. Eventually the oversight is corrected and Elwood is ushered into the sanitarium for treatment. However, a reprieve comes when Dr. Chumley (Cecil Kellaway) realizes that Elwood is not crazy.  You see, Harvey really does exist. He?s an invisible spirit guide of sorts, presiding over those who need his services the most.  This film is a delightful blend of comedy and drama and blessed with an inexplicable magic that makes the entire premise seem entirely plausible. <BR>The transfer is stunning! The black and white DVD exhibits ideal picture quality. Blacks are black. The gray scale is superbly balanced. There's really nothing more to say about the transfer, other than it is simply one of the best you are likely to encounter of a vintage classic on the digital format. The audio is mono but nicely balanced. Extras include an introduction by James Stewart that is a bit on the long side but too short to be considered a documentary. You also get the film's theatrical trailer.

6301247485|2.0|The novel by F.S.Fitzgerald seemed to be a very good basic for a successful adaptation. It is a truthful and insightful picture of the 1920's America. However experienced the team creating a movie may be though, it appeared to be very hard to express the meaning of the novel and come up to it.<BR>   &quot;The great Gatsby&quot; from the year 1974 with good reason was prized for the music and costumes. The realism and a very detailed way of preparing marvelous parties at Gatsby's place, colorful and beautiful costumes, the bands rendering the atmosphere of the Jazz Age; all of this was really taking my breath away. The director Jack Clayton and Nelson Riddle responsible for the music disserve a huge applause for an enormous piece of work they did. But, what I regret to admit, this is actually all that the movie can offer. <BR>   The film is very faithful towards the novel and uses a lot of quotations to be as close to the general sense as possible. Unfortunately, it is not very much thought-out and lacks of the deeper message that Fitzgerald's text undoubtedly has. The characters are rather flat and some of the important themes omitted.<BR>   In my opinion the best performance gave Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway. That was the only round character in the movie, with almost all the meanings he had in the novel. The most annoying actress was Mia Farrow as Daisy. Her voice and the way of acting could really get on the audience' nerves. She created Daisy as a thoughtless, a little bit insane girl. She some how showed only the outer side of this character without really becoming and understanding Daisy.<BR>   I am also very much disappointed with the Robert Redford's acting. Of course, he took care of the general impression of Gatsby being a newly reach and, in a way, conceited loner. He looked very well never sweating like the rest and looking at Daisy with the real desire, bitterness and longing. But, in my opinion, at the time he lacked the maturity needed for creatingsuch a complicated character.<BR>   After reading &quot;The great Gatsby&quot; I was expecting much more from the movie. And, as I wrote above, it can only impress the audience with its splendor. I cannot call it a successful movie because of the superficiality.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This is a great, heartwarming holiday movie.  Yes, it has some language and situations that are very adult but somehow they are not offensive.  I was charmed by the couple who meet as extras on a porno set yet are shy and ever so polite as they try to work up the courage to see each other off set.  The love stories vary from romantic love to unrequited love, to love of family and love of friends.  the characters become very real even though they may only have short times on the screen.  The young boy who will stop at nothing to win the attention of his dream girl at school is just darling!  As in reality, not all of the stories end happily but you will leave the theatre feeling good.
B0000542D2|5.0|How the F*** can Cranky Reviewer (who by the way has wrotten some of the worst reviews ever. Check his area to see) say the beatles are a freaking rip-off of Oasis?!?! I mean F***, the bandmembers might havent even been borned yet!! Technacily Oasis is a good band but to say this blasfemy is just stupid! Im thinking hes doing this to anger us, but really.<br />-By the way the movie is great. Great songs and the visual for those songs is awesome, though one can say it INSPIRED, NOT RIPED-OFF, Oasis and maybe that lame Spice world movie.
B000002LQR|5.0|I will make this short.  If you know what good music is, and you haven't bought this CD, buy it NOW.  Absolutely incredible from beginning to end.  The feel of this album is incredible, and I have never heard anything else that remotely compares to it.
B00005JM02|5.0|Most of the upsetting scenes for my 2 year old daughter occur in the beginning of the film...the mother is eaten, Nemo is kidnapped, and the father is chased by a large shark. But the rest of the movie is absolutely wonderful and very entertaining for her. I like that the dvd has scene selection. We simply start up the movie for her after the \\"scary\\" scenes, and we haven't had to worry about nightmares.

B00005JMFR|2.0|Matrix: *****<BR>Matrix Reloaded: ***<BR>Matrix Revolutions: **<br />Before I address this review we must see the trilogy as a whole. The difference between Reloaded and the original is that the original had more of an indie film feel with a novel premise. Reloaded cashed in by giving us better special effects with less story. Revolutions gives us less special effects, less story and some sort of a justification finale.<br />Revolutions has its problems from the onset. The story is derived directly from Reloaded with little emphasis on the original movie. There are too many characters from Reloaded given a way too much screen time in Revolutions and other characters from Reloaded are simply omitted (The Twins), dealt with too briefly (Morpheus, The Architect) or forgotten about in the course of the movie (The Trainman). Some characters are even changed (the oracle is replaced because of the original actresses death.) New characters are introduced but they have very little bearing on the story. So what is it all about? <br />The truth is that Revolutions is just plain crap. It is served along with Reloaded as an \\"enjoy the special effects... but that is all there is to it.\\" type of film. The effects in Reloaded are better. The center action piece in Revolutions revolves around the machines attacking Zion with \\"Aliens\\" type robot units manned by soldiers fighting them off. The other action sequence is the fight between Neo and Agent Smith which is not nearly as good as the one in the original movie.<br />The film does not end too badly but it does leave you feeling unsatisfied. Bottom line is that you should go to see it but it really is not a very good blockbuster movie by a long shot. (...)<br />Fans will not be too happy.
B00005JM02|5.0|The first time I heard about this movie, I thought it would be the worst PIXAR movie created.  My mom dragged me along to see it with my little brother, and I'm glad she did.  This movie kept me rolling!  It is the best PIXAR movie I have seen!  I am extremely pleased they created it.  You will be crying at parts and laughing at others.  The animation is beautiful.  And Dory, a forgetful fish, will be quite unforgettable.  Extremely cute and one of the best movies this year.
B00007AJF8|5.0|\\"Being John Malkovich\\" is one of the most daring, strangest, and original movies in years.  We meet unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), tepidly married to wife Lotte Schwartz (Cameron Diaz), who has filled their small apartment with psychologically damaged zoo animals.  Craig is only engaged when practicing his artistic puppetry (the film opens with a puppet doing the \\"dance of despair\\").<br />Craig finds a want ad for a \\"fast-fingered\\" man and is hired as a filing clerk, on the 7 1/2th floor of an office building.  The ceilings are less than 5 feet high, and everyone walks around stooped.  His ancient boss wants to talk about his ancient sexual conquests, and the boss's secretary deliberately mistranslates everyone's speech.  So, loser Craig now has oppressive home and work life, when he meets the devious Maxine (Catherine Keener).  Craig falls for Maxine, Maxine couldn't care less about Craig, and lets him know in the nastiest way.  Craig doesn't care.<br />One day he finds an opening behind a file cabinet and follows it into... John Malkovich's head.  For 15 minutes Craig experiences Malkovich's ride in a taxicab.  Then Craig is dumped by the side of the NJ Turnpike.  He tells Maxine all about it, and she immediately sees the business possibilities.  Craig goes along, wanting to please her.  Lotte meets Maxine and also falls for her.  Maxine decides she prefers Lotte, but only when Lotte goes through the portal and is \\"being John Malkovich.\\"  Craig, by now insanely jealous, locks Lotte in the chimp cage and becomes Malkovich himself, knowing Maxine has a \\"date\\" with \\"Lotte.\\"<br />And things continue from there, plenty more plot I haven't told you about, such as what happens when Malkovich finds out about this business venture!  Director Spike Jonze did a marvelous job with the lighting and sets; Craig's life on the bizarre 7 1/2th floor is just as cramped and closed-in as his apartment full of pets with childhood trauma.  Only in Malkovich's worldis there space and light.  <br />A brilliant original.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park takes all of the horrible aspects of wonderful bands like Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, and AC/DC, and mixes them into a hunk of poo. this album is garbage. I was severly dissapointed with Hybrid theory, but at least that was tolerable. Re-animation took a mediocre album, and made it worse. things like that should not be tampered with. this reached an all time low. if i could i would give it a zero, exept for the song Faint which is the only thing i think theyve done thats any good.
B00005JM02|5.0|If you missed this film in theatres this summer, don't despair; it's out on DVD and it looks great.<br />Finding Nemo uses the same formula Disney has recycled since Bambi: take a young animal, put him in danger, and kill off one of his parents (usually mommy).  Nemo's mom is eaten by a barricuda before the opening credits and he hasn't even hatched yet.  Alas, all his siblings' eggs are eaten, too, and his big-thinking father (Albert Brooks) turns into a neurotic worrywort once the opening credits have finished.  Marlin is determined that nothing will happen to his son, and hovers overprotectively, leading Nemo to take a dare he wouldn't have had dad stayed in the schoolyard with the other parents.  Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and taken to Sydney to live in a dental office fish tank.  Dad Marlin, having already lost his wife and other children, will stop at nothing to get Nemo back, be it sharks, explosives, angler fish, whales, or pelicans.<br />The film is an interesting mix of sitcom (Nemo's tankmates seem straight out of Cheers), action/adventure (near-escapes from various sea predators), farce (vegetarian sharks on 12-step programs, anyone?  Surfer dude sea turtles?), nature documentary (seagulls who chant &quot;mine! mine!&quot;), camp (tank escape plots straight out of Hogan's Heroes or Chicken Run) and pathos (Marlin lost his son by always meddling).  The parallel stories of Marlin seeking his son, with the &quot;help&quot; of a forgetful Dory (Ellen deGeneres), and Nemo learning he can handle the real world, under the tutelege of tank leader Gill (William Dafoe) reinforce the film's basic message to trust in each other and love will conquer all.<br />Did I mention that the animation is absolutely spectacular?  If you haven't seen any of Pixar's films in the last few years, you must take a look at this one.  A delightful film for kids and adults.
B00005JMFR|5.0|What's the problem folks? Why is this one so hard for people to swallow? It was an incredible film. And who keeps saying there wasn't enough action? Were they in the bathroom the whole time the machines were attacking Zion? Series not resolved? Of course it was. Neither The Matrix or the machines were destroyed, this is true. However, the series was about Neo, and Neo's story was resolved. And what was there to not get? I keep hearing from people who were confused during this movie. How? I don't understand that. Reloaded had so much more senseless babble that went on and on. Remember the scene with the Architect in Reloaded? Now that was a lot of long-winded crap. Or Neo's conversation with the Oracle in the park, now that had some truly bad dialogue. Revolutions is so much more advanced than Reloaded. I don't know. It makes me sad that so many are depriving themselves of an amazing movie, but that's alright, I loved it and strongly urge others to see it for themselves.
B00008WJBU|5.0|Some people believe that a certain kind of thing can bring a good luck to them.  Clover with four leaves, black cat (in England), and Japanese beckoning cat.  Then, what if a luck happens to be something you can steal, collect, and use?  And use to kill?<br />&quot;Intacto&quot; is a bizarre, unnerving, and quite original thriller from young Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo.  Its story is complicated, but is not hard to follow.  One crimial Thomas (Sbaraglia), the only surviver of a terrible plane crash, meets a strange guy Federico in the hospital.  Federico asks Thomas to draw a card just casually.  Little did Thomas know that it is only the beginning of games that test his own luck ... the game that becomes more and more deadly as it goes on.<br />As Federico and Thomas travel together, they unwittingly involve some other 'lucky' characters; Sara, female police investigator who seems to be unaware of her own luck; Arejandro, a bull fighter who somehow got never hurt; and Sam, the owner of a casino (excellent Max von Sidow), who survived one of the tragic events known in the world's history.      <br />This is Fresnadillo's feature debut (though his short &quot;Esosados&quot; has been nominated for Oscar in 1996), and like another talented Spanish director of &quot;Open Your Eyes,&quot; he has his own style.  The picture always exudes some eerie atomosphere (like David Lynch), and though his narrative gets slightly confusing (especially the conclusion), he carries this unusual material to the end quiet gracefully.<br />There are many &quot;games&quot; that test the characters' lucks, which might look, to be frank, somewhat silly to some of us.  Certainly few of us would dare to do these things, risking their limbs and life, but the director has enough visual skills to convince us that there must be some people who try to run THERE, blindfolded.<br />My material says that the director actually witnessed the plane accident in the Canary Island when he has achild, and that experience is part of inspiration of the film.  Also, he has read the books of Primo Levi (&quot;Survival in Auschwitz&quot;), whose background helped to develop the concept.  The film at first sight looks too incredible, but close inspection reveals that it contains thought-provoking things like the guilty feeling which some survivers of terrible accidents have.<br />But of course, you can enjoy it as entertainment, and as such &quot;Intacto&quot; is just great.  And the images are very beautiful, such as the bleak landscape of the Canary Island (where the casino is set). <br />Hollywood (Buena Bista, at the time of writing) has already bought the right of remake, and that fact testifies that the film is very original.  If you like the kind of films like &quot;Thesis&quot; or &quot;Open Your Eyes,&quot; you should not miss this thriller.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Along with George Lucas with the STAR WARS series, The Wachowski Brothers have gone to the well that was expounded by Joseph Campbell with epochal \\"The Hero of Thousand Faces\\" to create another myth for our time. What became in THE MATRIX is story of the naif (John Anderson a/k/a Neo) who called to his path by a mysterious shaman (Morpheus. In THE MATRIX RELOADED, that naif is still awakening and fighting every minion of (...)on his great path. In REVOLUTIONS, the naif has finally awakened to realized that he and his path must end. <BR> In short, REVOLUTIONS concludes all of this with all of the vigor that Wagner put into ending his Ring Cycle. The Machine assault on Zion is an assault on the senses that can be best described and viewed as Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH if it was directed by Jackson Pollock. <BR>  For me, the trilogy will provide food for thought for audiences, critics and students of cinema for years to come.
B00004XONN|1.0|Don't believe the hype. This is horrendous.<BR>Just because this is Radiohead, a band I would have considered among my favorites before this excrementally horrible piece of garbage, does not mean this is good. Anyone who says otherwise is just as big a sheep as Thom Yorke so frequently writes about.<BR>This isn't music, this is atmosphere, and harshly unpleasant atmosphere at that. I'm truly at a loss to describe how mind-numbingly bad this is, but I'll try. If you don't like melody, buy this album. If you like skittering, slithering rythms with nothing else adorning them, buy this album. If you like non-musical bursts and bleeps of sound, buy this album. If you can't stand guitars, audible lyrics, or any identifiable instrument, buy this album.<BR>One moment I do, however, enjoy is the sound that I can best describe as a New Orleans Jazz Marching band being crused by a boulder on the title track.<BR>If you're capable of independent thought, I can't, in good conscience, reccomend this horrible, horrible album.<BR>I do however, recomend the live albums that these songs appear on. They are evidence that this music isn't bad when made by actual people, and that Radiohead still has it - they just went temporarily insane on this album.

B00000JXVK|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. I watched it after I started riding dirt bikes, however, I can understand how it would have inspired many people people to start riding motorcycles. In all of his films, Bruce Brown has the unique ability to portray that &quot;you shoulda been there&quot; feeling. Never in my life have I wanted to travel back in time more than when I watched this movie. I can only imagine what it would have been like racing across the SoCal desert atop a 500cc Husqvarna, riding right next to Steve McQueen. Buy this DVD.
B000000WG4|5.0|I heard it for the first time at 10 years old when somebody that I knew wanted to show me his musical taste.  He had a great collection of albums (Mike Oldfield, Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Chick Corea).  No doubt for me at that time, this guy knew more about music than anybody else around me.  27 years later, I still think he had the nicest musical tastes with the exception of Chick Corea which I don't buy.<br />A nicely done album which is a kind of homage to a lot of musical instruments.<br />I am attracted to bell sounds in music since this album.
B000002O5L|4.0|This is Tom Petty's first album without his Heartbreakers and since the initiation of The Traveling Wilburys in 1988. The songs on this album are very good. Hits include FREE FALLIN',I WON'T BACK DOWN,LOVE IS A LONG ROAD,FACE IN THE CROWD,RUNNIN' DOWN A DREAM and YER SO BAD. This was one of the best-selling albums of 1989. Some of the aforementioned hits debuted on the radio in early 1990(the album continued to sell well then). After track 5 on the CD and before track 6,is the following message spoken by Petty: &quot;HELLO CD LISTENERS! WE'VE COME TO THE POINT OF THIS ALBUM WHERE THOSE LISTENING TO THE LP OR CASSETTE WILL HAVE TO TURN OVER THE RECORD OR TAPE. IN FAIRNESS TO THOSE LISTENING TO THE CD,WE'LL TAKE A FEW SECONDS BEFORE BEGINNING SIDE 2. THANK YOU. HERE'S SIDE 2.&quot; Obvioiusly Side 2 of the LP or cassette begins with FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER. That message is only heard when the CD is played in the normal mode. Great album,though!
B00005UEAR|5.0|No, they don't have limits.  Their musicianship is certainly not limited because they can do anything.  Having their own sound but audaciously picking styles of other master musicians here and there.  Can't limit themselves to 5 minutes songs, they just need to extend them over 10 minutes.  No limits to their solo acts too.<br />Disc two is my favorite with the &quot;Goodnigh kiss&quot; and &quot;Solitary shell&quot;.  There is two song titles that I hate to see on an album, &quot;Overture&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; because I never like them.  &quot;Overture&quot; on this one is no exception.<br />Disc one was the reason why I bought this album.  Particularly for song &quot;The great debate&quot; that I heard somewhere?? As always, the etheral part caught my attention.  Nice disc too.<br />Can't describe them to well as there is too much to say about them.  You need to listen.
B000003TA4|1.0|I saw a review below that said nirvana &quot;inspired&quot; Pearl Jam... dude, what kind of drugs are you on? nirvana inspired Pearl Jam about as much as Poison inspired Led Zeppelin, kid.  maybe you should look around a bit, i read an article on here that explains how pearl jam created nirvana, just get your info straight boy.  &amp; that brings me to this review, this album wasnt revolutionary... maybe in the mtv world, but this album could be called a rip-off of 'Doolittle' by the Pixies.. when Pearl Jam released 'Vs' in 1993, that was truly revolutionary, maybe not commercially, despite it being the fastest selling album ever, but it certainly was revolutionary musically, something nirvana has never done, but took credit for
B00005JMFR|5.0|When I went into the theater, I realized that my questions would be answered.  I thought about how everybody thought that this movie wouldn't live up to the hipe that it generated.  You know what?  I hate it when people do that.  They try to force their opinions on others to try and ruin it for us.  Well, when I saw this movie, I completely forgot what they said about this movie and the others before it.  I loved this movie so much.  I was so absorbed by it.  It answered all of my questions, and if it didn't answer all of yours, you just didn't look hard enough.  Instead of trying to look at all of it's faults, I paid attention to the actual movie.  The battles were the greatest I've seen yet.  The music was fantastic and went perfectly with the mood of each scene.  I was totally satisfied by the end of this movie.  And if you weren't, oh well.  I liked it, and that's all that matters.

B0000CDL93|3.0|The movie &quot;JFK&quot; is a slick piece of movie making, for which I grudglingly give it 3 stars, but it is NOT history. It lionizes Jim Garrison as if he were a hero, when he was anything but. Garrison had no credible evidence, changed theories more often than he changed his shirt, and relied on a cast of witnesses that would make the average county jail population look like the Chamber of Commerce by comparison. He proceeded to railroad forward a prosecution of Clay Shaw that was so transparent it became a national embarrasment. When the case went to trial, it was not Garrison who courageously argued it in court (like the movie depicts). He assigned that suicide mission to his deputies. He had started his investigation in early 1966, arrested Shaw over a year later in March 1967, then took nearly two more years to get the case to trial. He thus had over three years to investigate and assemble his proof, but when it finally went to the jury, the evidence was so insubstantial that in 45 minutes (and just one ballot) they acquitted Shaw. For a prosecutor, that's like getting pantsed in a Louisiana downpour.  One juror later reported they would have been back in half the time, but a few of them needed to use the restroom before returning to court. <br />Stone (a gifted film maker) took Garrison's fantasy, then &quot;dramatized&quot; (changed) some of the facts, and created others, to make things seem more plausible. For example, the Donald Sutherland character in the film didn't even exist (check Garrison's book).  Also, Stone portrays supposed witness David Ferrie as being forced to ingest something which kills him -- a murder.  Garrison's original theory on Ferrie's death was suicide (he developed more sinister explanations later).  In fact, Ferrie died of natural causes due to a type of brain aneurysm that is impossible to fake or induce.  But that doesn't make good drama.<br />The resulting film is fiction based on fiction. It has the same relationship to actual history that the Jerry Springer Show has to investigative journalism.  A slick movie, for which I give it 3 stars, but in its underlying premise and point, pure fiction.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Yeah, you heard all the critcism.  From the serious critics, there is not enough emotion and an overbearingly metaphorical plot.  From the arm-chair critics, there is not enough action and a convoluted plot.  Both of these camps agree that they should have left well-enough alone with the first film.<br />I respectfully disagree.  I do not believe that the writers/directors planned on there being only one film.  Remember what the Oracle prophesized to Neo in the middle of the first film - either Neo or Morpheus will die.  It took the third and final installment of the trilogy to bring this prophesy to fruition and bring the story full-circle.<br />(...)
0385504209|2.0|Another reviewer accurately terms the writing &quot;paint by numbers&quot; and I must agree. My family and I listened to the audio tape together and had predicted out the plot by the end of the first side of tape I. The concept is old, and has been better done by others. Very disappointing.
6304493681|4.0|This is sort of a cross between Blade Runner, The Terminator and La Femme Nikita. The animation is good.  The story is interesting and raises some philosophical questions. I thought the characters were a bit underdeveloped, although the character biographies in the special features help by giving some background. Another problem is that the music calls too much attention to itself by getting way too strident at times. Overall it's worth a look, especially if you are a fan of anime.
B00005JMFI|5.0|This is a great Christmas movie for people of all ages. The plot is about an elf who needs to figure out who his real family is and where he belongs.

What's the story being told?<br />This album is simply one of the most melancholy, beautiful, trippy and soulful albums I've heard, ever. Period. For all the five-star reviewers here gushing, each song brings out certain emotions and memories and quickly associates itself with them. For some, it speaks to driving in Kansas City late at night, for others, makes them think of the NY waterfront. We each have our own special place we go to when we hear this music. For me, it's sitting on the cliff edges of Ireland, seagulls squawking above, waves crashing below, and Midnight in a Perfect World being... perfect.<br />This classic groundbreaker will make you rethink your ideas of hiphop.

0679441018|5.0|Anne Rice's Memnoch the Devil<BR>Book Review<BR>Vampires, witches, and the walking dead are all things you would expect to read about in one of Anne Rice's books. The book I am doing a review on is called Memnoch the Devil and the author is the New Orleans writer Anne Rice. This book is the fifth book in a series of books called the vampire chronicles, and the last and final chapter in the vampire Lestat's adventures and also the most interesting to read out of the five.<BR> I gave Memnoch the Devil five stars because I think the book is the best vampire book Anne Rice has yet to write for many reasons. One, because it end the story of Lestat her most beloved character from the Interview With the Vampire, and second, it gives a different way of thinking on life after death.<BR> This book is very fast paced going from being stalked by the devil (That hates names given to him through out time such as Satan, Lucifer, and the prince of darkness. He wants to be called by his original name, which is Memnoch.) to passing through heaven and hell to help the devil.<BR> The devil in this story is not depicted as the well known evil devil from the bible but he depicted as a compassionate being that's story for being in hell that he created is for getting humans right with God and sent back to heaven.<BR> The language used in this book is very descriptive. In one scene Lestat is in a small restaurant having a cup of coffee, not drinking the coffee but letting the heat rise to heat his face and taking in the drinks smell. The way Anne Rice describes that scene you can almost hear the people around Lestat and can smell the coffee in front of him as if you were actually there because of the way it is described.<BR> The story of Memnoch takes place in New Orleans Louisiana as well as most of Anne Rice's book about vampires and witches. In the story this is Lestat's final adventure he is writing about, in the book it starts with the devil following him around as a ghost finally asking him for help and Lestat is shown heaven and hell and how the creation of man came to be, to finally watching Jesus crucified on the cross and talking with God. <BR> The vampires in Anne Rice's books are not shown to be monsters as they are shown in most vampire movies, her vampires have a personality as Lestat does, he is still depicted as intelligent, and a witty know it all with a French manner of speaking. With all of Anne Rice's vampire books you get a sense of wisdom from the way they speak as if they really have been around for centuries.<BR>Putting a end to the vampire chronicles with this book Memnoch the Devil, the ending of the book will have the reader wishing for another book for more insight because Lestat does not stay in heaven or hell he just goes insane stopping the book with him tied up screaming in his tower after the devil returns his eyeball in a box to him from hell.<BR> I really enjoyed this book; I had to go back and reread it after I was done with it the first time I liked so much. I would recommend Memnoch the Devil to anyone who has ever read any of Anne Rice's books and enjoyed them or to anyone who likes vampire books because she always has the best insight and stories for her vampires. That is why I gave her book five stars in the review because of her sheer brilliance in the book about a vampire and the devil.
B000007ODL|5.0|This is my first JJ Cale album. WHERE HAVE I BEEN???<BR> The music is a refreshing, original and all consuming ~~ I haven't stopped listening since the minute it went into my player.<br />You will not waste a penny buying this!!!
B0000027RL|5.0|Nevermind had more music videos than 'Ten', it was more promoted, it was played on MTV &amp; the radio more... it still is, 'Nevermind' is usually always above 'Ten' on every best album list... etc, etc...<br />Yet... even though all of this is true...<br />Nevermind = 10 million copies sold<br />Ten = almost 12 million copies sold<br />the point? Pearl Jam didnt need mtv, the radio, or critics to prove to everyone they were much better than Nirvana, &amp; made a much better album than 'Nevermind', numbers dont lie<br />Why would 'Ten' of sold more than 'Nevermind'? if 'Nevermind' was , &amp; still is, much more promoted? the only option that leaves is because of the music<br />This, was the true explosion from Seattle.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Living in the U.K.therefore not realisticaly having the oppurtunity to see Rush on the Vapor Trails Tour,the Rush in Rio was a must buy.First impression was what an interesting cover ,quite humourus for a band that has a stuffy ,boring tag in the U.K.Turning over to see the tracklist was a huge dissapointment.Tracks like Tom Sawyer,Big Money,Trees, Freewill,Dreamline,Red Sector A,2112,Limelight,Strangiato,Spirit of Radio seem like they're on every live Rush album.To be honest after seeing the track list I almost put the C.D. back on the shelf.However ,owning everything they've ever recorded I went ahead and bought it anyway.The first thing I noticed was how good the sound was,quite raw and unpolished .It sounded how a live album should sound &quot;LIVE&quot;.I do however own a rather expensive hi-fi which I'm sure must help.Personally I think its the best Live Rush album by a mile.Different Stages and Show of Hands have been tinkered with Exit Stage Left didn't have a live feel at all.All The Worlds a Stage is up there with Rock in Rio in terms of a true raw live sound.I'm really looking forward to the DVD I just wish they'd leave out the tracks we've heard live a thousand times for some of their other classics as well as more stuff of Vapor Trails like Freeze,Peaceable Kingdom and Nocturne.
B000003TA4|1.0|Everybody, EVERYBODY is sick of Nirvana &amp; Nirvana fans. at one point in time, nobody really cared, &amp; lots more even LIKED nirvana... but now EVERYONE IS SICK OF NIRVANA AND HOW MUCH CREDIT THEY GET!!!! Nirvana does NOT deserve as much credit as the Cure, or Pearl Jam, or ALice in Chains, or the Smashing Pumpkins! down with Nirvana, everyone is so incredibly SICK &amp; even DISGUSTED with them by now, just shut up about them, this album is NOTHING compared to ANY of the Cure's albums, and Pearl Jam's albums, thats a fact
B00000JLWW|4.0|Okay, I've been reading all the reviews of this movie, and even though I've already posted my review, I felt the need to do it again. I like this movie because it accurately portrays the evnts of the sinking, and, also, it shows what the human race is like when disaster strikes. I'm very into the Titanic itself, learning about the history and events of that time. However, even saying all this.... this was not an extraordinary movie on the whole, and certainly not the best movie ever made. If you don't know anything about the time in which this movie takes place, or even interested in it, you probably won't like it or understand it. And the acting certainly wasn't great. The dialog at times was cliched and predictable. The special effects, at the time, were the one thing the movie had that was great, to even die-hard haters. I, myself, was partial to automatically give this movie a great rating, simply because I am so interested in the subject. But after reading the reviews of other people, I can see why not everyone will like it. But so what? If you don't like it, you don't like it. But do we need to argue like children? I understand why the people that liked it did, and I also understand why the people that didn't like it, didn't like it. But give it a rest already. If you really didn't like the movie, then why are you wasting your &quot;supposed&quot; intelligence to keep complaining about it? Titanic was made over 6 years ago, so just move on. And if you DO like the movie.... then just keep liking it and stop wasting your time arguing over something pointless. Anyway, with that said, I found this movie great for die-hard TITANIC fans, and just average for the others :)
B000002AZ8|5.0|This album is so raw, intense, emotional, demented, twisted, &amp; powerful, its hard to keep up with...<br />If you see bad reviews for this album, its only because people dont know how to keep up with an album this emotional
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is one of the simplest movies ever made.  And yet, it is absolutely brilliant.  The misadventures of Dante and Randal became the basis for 4 other movies, and it is a genuinely entertaining 90 minutes.<br />What makes this black and white movie with little camera movement and bad sound so great?  The script.  The dialogue is hysterical.  Smith really hit a homerun with some of his material here.  From &quot;37&quot;, to Randal's video order, to the overall &quot;I'm Not Even Supposed to Be Here Today&quot; recurring joke, the movie nails just about everything it goes for.  Kudos to Brian OHalloran and especially Jeff Anderson for just nailing the script.<br />If you want to laugh, check this out!
B00004Z459|1.0|THIS IS THE WAY PEOPLE WILL REMEMBER THESE UNTALENTED GUYS TEN YEARS AFTER... SHAME! AVOID THIS TRASH! INSTEAD OF THAT, TRY MASTER OF PUPPETS FROM METALLICA, OR EVEN REAL ROCK BANDS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN, OR, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING MORE ACTUAL, TRY DREAM THEATER.

B00000DRA9|5.0|Mmmm, how I love this music... this movie was always one of my favorite movies as a kid, and listening to the music always takes me back to my childhood, to those happy times... anytime I'm feeling stressed, or down and out, I just need to put this on and it's all happy!! <br />But the cd transcends the movie in my opinion... yes the nostalgia factor is part of its appeal, but it also is full of real emotion... listen to the Happy Flight melody, and tell me you don't feel happy and upbeat while it's playing... the little Fantascia part is errie, while the Ivory Tower part as a cool little triumphant feel to it... and Theme of Sadness... oh my, it almost makes me cry everytime... kids music my ass, this is adult music, full of complicated emotions!<br />I don't know if I'll ever be confident in my self to put this on during a party or anything, but damn this cd is good... if I have to keep my love of this music secret so as to not be outcast by my friends, then so be it... but this music RULES!!! :)
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The Strokes should have a slogan , like a disclaimer, on every t-shirt they sell.<BR>''If you haven't heard it before, You won't hear it here.''<br />There is nothing wrong with that statement.<BR>Room on Fire keeps the party going, and also taps into every corner of your buzz, good or bad, like the friend that parties and parties and never seems to fall down.<br />Oh, and Reptilia is the best of all 80's style revisionist singles. Hot Hot Heat and the like should take note.
0446530891|2.0|I'm a fan of Baldacci's books. This one is a real page turner and you spend a good moment, until you arrive after de 2/3 of the book. Then you realize something is wrong with the story, that is a bit artificial... This feeling is confirmed by one of the most ridiculous &quot;end-revelation-solution&quot; that I have read in my life. I told myself: &quot;He's kidding&quot;... But no, Baldacci is not kidding.
B00000IP3S|5.0|The title is kinda stupid to this review, but this is really a great album. I bought this album with &quot;Tales From the Twilight World&quot; after purchasing &quot;Nightfall In Middle-Earth&quot;. The album is great from start to finish. I'm not sure BG knows how to make a bad album. What can I say metal at it's finest. So if your tired of the nu metal check out this band.
B000059QY3|5.0|This is an outstanding Traviata, the best I have seen.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have been reading a lot of pretty harsh reviews of Sarah McLachlan's newest release - Afterglow.<br />I have not shared the same expeirence with this cd.<br />My family lost my grandmother about a year ago. She was the center of the family, the heart. She and I were extreemly close, and I find myself a year later struggling day to day with her death.<br />When I first listened to Afterglow, I was instantly struck with the sense that I may be listening to the most beautiful female voice I'd ever heard. The way the sound of her voice rolled over the words to the songs like water over rocks in a stream moved me.<br />Then I started listening closely to the words to the songs.<br />The songs seemed to travel the journey of someone who was going through the stages of grief. The pain and suffering behind each sigh made my heart stop.<br />When I listened to the words of the song &quot;Drifting&quot;, tears started to stream down my face as I drove my car. I felt like someone was singing a song about how much I missed my Grandmother. I felt her pain, it was also mine.<br />Obviously, Sarah McLachlan has used this album as an outlet to deal with the loss of her mother, and the birth of her daughter. I think the songs on this album are a reminder of one of life's greatest lessons; with each death a new life begins.<br />If I ever met Sarah McLachlan on the street, I'd feel compelled to stop her and thank her. This cd is a piece of beautiful art that I can listen to and use to reflect on and heal from the greatest loss of my life thus far.<br />&quot;Cast me gently into morning, for the night has been unkind.&quot;<br />Thank You,<br />A Sarah McLachlan Fan
B00008MLSH|5.0|This is one of the best recent classical vocal albums. She has a beautiful voice and uses it with intelligence and feeling. I look forward to hearing more of her.
B000002H3E|5.0|Under Lock and Key(1985). Dokken's third studio album.<br />Dokken started out in 1983 with their first album, Breaking The Chains, which although raw, it showed a stunning display of musicianship between Don Dokken's vocal delivery and legendary guitarist George Lynch's killer riffing. It continued on with the harder edged sophomore effort, Tooth And Nail(1984). This album delved into the more metallic side of Dokken's abilities due to their blazing title track which can be comparable to the faster songs of Judas Priest. It also housed their first major hit, 'Alone Again' which was unintentionably responsible for coining the decade's popular phrase &quot;monster ballad&quot;.<br />By 1985, Dokken had reached popular status and was labeled as one of the forerunners of glam metal. They shed some of the hard metallic qualities that dominated TaN, and even though they softened their sound a bit for ULaK, the songwriting remained a strong point for them, and hasn't been this great since this album. It takes on a dark melodic overtone throughout the whole disc. The production is actually nice and polished here and every instrument from the wailing guitars to the echoing hammer-pound drums can be heard clearly. While there are certainly more ballads here, there are no &quot;filler&quot; songs to be found. This album succeeds on all levels due to the fact that when the songs intend to be soft and melodic, they do exactly that, and same thing with the faster and heavier tracks. ULaK is accessible enough that anybody who is new to the band should start here before checking out the other albums. Here's the lowdown:<br />1) Unchain The Night- Great start to the album with its keyboard backed intro and transition into a melodic rocker. I'm quite surprised that this song didn't end up on Dokken's Greatest Hits disc, considering it was actually quite a hit for them. Excellent. Sounds somewhat like Bon Jovi's song 'Secret Dreams'. *****<br />2) Hunter- This song slows the pace down, but it's not quite a ballad. Another winner here. Don's vocals shine on this one. *****<br />3) In My Dreams- Wow. Probably one of the catchiest songs Dokken has ever written. Similar in style to 'Unchain The Night'. It'll be sure to stick in your head long after it's over. *****<br />4) Slippin' Away- ULaK's first ballad. This one never became a hit, but it's a good ballad nonetheless. ****<br />5) Lightning Strikes Again- SIMPLY AWESOME! The band breaks from the mid-paced anthems and ballads to deliver a fast balls-to-the-wall rocker. Great guitarwork and drumming. I wish this track could've become a hit. *****<br />6) It's Not Love- This anthem is actually ULaK's biggest hit to emerge, and yet I find it to actually be the weakest song on here. Still, it's not bad at all and it contains a small interesting dialogue section after the solo with Don and some girl. ****<br />7) Jaded Heart- The second ballad to be found here. It's very lightweight and melodic, but if you hear the song, it's actually a good thing. In the same vein as 'Alone Again' although it never became big like the aformentioned song. *****<br />8) Don't Lie To Me- A straight-ahead rocking anthem similar to tracks 1 and 3. What makes this one stand out to me is George Lynch's rhythm guitaring sounds its best here of the three mentioned tracks. Don't skip this song or you'll be missing out. *****<br />9) Will The Sun Rise?- Again, this track is another straight-ahead rocker, though this one combines accoustic and electric guitar stylings. It doesn't really stand out from the other songs here, but it does bear a resemblance to the Def Leppard song 'Foolin'. ****<br />10) Till The Living End- Perfect title for the final track, and what a way to end an incredible album. Another fast rocker in which George Lynch's guitar shredding ability is at its best. Sounds like a cross between an earlier Dokken song, 'Live To Rock, Rock To Live' and the Judas Priest song 'Freewheel Burning'. Thus ending an awesome album with a BANG! *****<br />Overall, I find ULaK to be Dokken's best album, although Breaking The Chains and Tooth And Nail come awfully close. 5 stars for excellent songwriting, production, and musicianship. It represents not only a high water mark for Dokken, but for any glam metal album as well. They may have lead the scene, but Dokken showed great talent when it came to their music. ANYONE WHO IS NEW TO THE BAND SHOULD START HERE, THOUGH YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY OF THE FIRST FOUR ALBUMS. Unfortunately, after Back For The Attack(1987), George Lynch left the band because he opted for more of a heavier sound, while Don Dokken was more into appealing to the girls. From then on, Dokken was done for in terms of creating solid music, but like Def Leppard, it's best to just remember them by their 80s material. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />Other similar dark, melodic, &amp; heavy albums that sound like ULaK include:<BR>-'Pyromania' by Def Leppard<BR>-'7800 Degrees Fahrenheit' by Bon Jovi<BR>-'Defenders Of The Faith' by Judas Priest<BR>-'Pride' by White Lion
B00005JM02|5.0|I did take the time to read the reviews even though I had already bought this movie, and I've now watched it 3 times.  Basically, this is one of the most spectacular achievements in CGI that I have seen yet, and I am a staunch supporter of Disney and Pixar.  This is a KID'S film!!!!  I say that because based on some of these reviews, people obviously don't understand that!  The characters don't need to be &quot;fleshed er-fished out&quot; because that would bore the kids to death!  As well as most people.  Remember how The Hulk backfired because of all that wonderful character development where it didn't belong?  Also, OF COURSE THE FISH WILL TALK!!!!  I refer back to my previous statement that this is a KID'S film!!!!! That floored me that there were actually people upset that the film wasn't &quot;realistic&quot; enough because the fish talked.  Also, my kids LOVED it, and one of them is very young, no nightmares here!!!   I honestly don't see where there is anything &quot;dark and scary&quot; in this movie.  But then, my kids aren't over sheltered either, and they can discern reality from fiction.  Anyways, we all loved this film, and will enjoy it for many years, and I will continue to shell out the money to Disney and Pixar in the hopes that they will keep making the movies that I have known and loved for all of my 30 years.
B00005JMFR|4.0|I rewatched &quot;The Matrix&quot; before I watched &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; on DVD, so that when I went to the theater and saw &quot;The Matrix Revolutions,&quot; I would have a fighting chance of being able to follow along and possibly appreciate the climax.  I would not say that the ending was predictable per se, but given the pair of problems afflicting Neo's world (the sentinels are coming to Zion City to kill all the humans while Smith is taking over every being in the Matrix) the solution has the virtue of logic (albeit Hollywood rather than cybernetic).  Anyway, I am not all that sure that thinking too much about this film is necessary for enjoying it, although I did take small pleasure in being ahead of Neo a couple of times in the film.  I do not thing there really could be any other ending, given the set up, but if you were expecting something spectacularly new and more substance than style in the conclusions of the trilogy, you are going to be disappointed.<br />&quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; comes down to two gigantic battles.  The first is the defense of the dock in Zion City when the sentinels break through.  What we have at that point is basically the biggest shootout video game you have ever seen.  The second is the final showdown between Neo and Smith, which manages to combine the contradictory principles of bigger and better with less is more.  While each is going on you are two busy enjoying the spectacle to be overly concerned with what it all means in the end.  I mean, sometimes a EMP is a good thing and who cares if kicking a computer virus is really not going to do it much harm?<br />For me this was the biggest kitchen sink movie I have ever seen.  The whole &quot;Matrix&quot; idea got props for being cutting edge, but for the finale I was repeatedly struck by bits and pieces of dozens of other films and had to fight down an urge to yell, &quot;Use the Force, Neo!&quot;  But there is a vessell fighting off attackers like &quot;Star Wars,&quot; big guns like in &quot;Aliens,&quot; millions of attacking creatures like in &quot;Star Ship Troopers,&quot; several scenes lifted from World War II movies, Neo fights Smith in a driving rain like the climax of &quot;The Seven Samurai,&quot; and dozens of other cinematic references.  This is not to say that these references are intentional homages, but neither are they intrusive (cf. &quot;The Rock&quot;).<br />I was also struck by how &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; has the same basic structure as &quot;The Return of the King,&quot; the upcoming conclusion of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; in that you have a giant pivotal battle (the Battle of the Pelinor Fields) and then the whole thing comes down to a mano e mano confrontation (Frodo and Gollum).  It also occurs to me with both of those movies and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; earlier this year, actor Hugo Weaving (Smith and Elrond), has the opportunity to be the first actor to ever appear in movies that came out in a single year that could end up earning $1 billion in the United States.  At the end of the first week of release of this film he has already broken the $400 million mark.ar Wars,&quot; big guns like in &quot;Aliens,&quot; millions of attacking creatures like in &quot;Star Ship Troopers,&quot; several scenes lifted from World War II movies, Neo fights Smith in a driving rain like the climax of &quot;The Seven Samurai,&quot; and dozens of other cinematic references.

B00005JLXE|4.0|I think the negativity exhibited towards this movie is misdirected.<BR>This is a fine superhero action movie. Period. The opening &quot;origin&quot; vignette actually is one of the best of its' type put to film. From casting to cinematography to editing...it's a beaut.<BR>Yes, Ben Affleck is a bit smug, but as a serious longtime comic geek, my big beef was that his hair wasn't red. That's it. That's all. No big deal.<BR>Jennifer Garner, as Elektra, is luminous. Perfect casting. They shoot her in a manner that elevates her from &quot;very pretty&quot; to &quot;absolutely stunning&quot;. Her intro works perfectly within the plot, and Murdock's &quot;superpowers&quot; are creatively and often poetically demonstrated.<BR>Colin Farrell joins the list of simply awesome movie villains. With a few quick scenes, you know all you need to know about Bullseye. His psycho-manic performance electrifies the screen.<BR>The story neatly encapsulates a chunk of the Elektra saga from the Frank Miller era in the comics. The winks toward the comic book audience were greatly appreciated. There are hundreds of not-so-subtle nods to the significant creators of Daredevil...Stan Lee's cameo, DD's dad fighting John Romita, name-dropping &quot;Miller, Mack and Bendis&quot; as fighters, &quot;Joe Quesada&quot; as a bad guy, Kevin Smith showing up as a guy named &quot;Kirby&quot;.<BR>But I particularly loved the angles and shots that recall specific classic images from those old books, especially the ending of the fight between Bullseye and Elektra (Frank Miller covers come to life), and the swirling cable around a plummeting Daredevil, evoking the cover of the most recent relaunch of the series.<BR>It's a &quot;dark&quot; movie, emotionally and cinematographically. The former didn't bother me, but the latter sometimes had me squinting trying to discern details.<BR>I have read many of the other reviews about this film, but I have to say I was totally satisfied  when it was over. I really did want more.
B00005JLRT|2.0|My God... what were they thinking? I used to be a big Star Trek fan... and still am, in some ways. I love the new series. However, I think the next generation has overstayed its welcome. That was clear to me with the dreadful Insurection, but is made abundantly clear by Nemesis. The only good thing I can say about it is that it isn't as bad as its predecessor. The story is laughable, Picard's clone ruling the Romulan Empire. The plot-twists, if they can even be called that, are predictable and downright ridiculous at times. Not worth your money....not worth your time.<BR>The verdict? Only see this if you're a REAL trekkie, otherwise it is a complete waste of time. What annoyed me most is that they contradict themselves... The least they could have done is do their research, Deanna Troy marrying Will Ryker? That's not what happened in the final episode of the series. If you ask me, I think they should have stopped making next generation films when the superb Voyager stopped being made, they should have switched to films about that instead.
B000000XB9|5.0|This CD features all 20 of Creedence Clearwater Revival's chart singles, so if you only need the hits, here they are.  It's all good stuff, too.  I have to mention that &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; is the full length album version, but for some reason, &quot;Susie Q&quot; is the single edit.  Still highly recommended.
B00000K31V|4.0|The intellectual counterpart of the matrix. This film is truly enjoyable and made me think. Not only that, but the first thing I said after seeing it for the first time was `are we still in the game?' It was disturbing, extremely well written, well acted, the special effects were very well done and an amazing atmosphere was created. Overall, I would recommend this film.<BR>The story is about the creator of a game called eXistenZ, which plugs into the human nervous system via a bioport on someone's back. It deals with far more though, it is not so much the story which is important, as are some of the underlying themes and questions, such as `what constitutes reality?'<BR>The verdict? Terribly good. Terribly engaging. Worth several views and capable of providing hours of material for discussion. Definitely a thinker, but very enjoyable if you don't feel up to that.
B000002KB8|5.0|This is the ultimate Black Sabbath album.  Other's may think that 'Paranoid' was the band's greatest work, but I beg to differ.  Their first album is so much more bluesier and has so much more different flavors to each song.  I often lie on my bed in the mornings, turn on this album, and don't get up until it's played from front to back.  Some people may think the first and last tracks on this album are slow, but I think the anticipation of Iommi's mind-blowing solos and Geezer and Ward's groovin' licks is half the fun.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Bruce Banner (Eric Bana)is a genetic scientist who, while trying to save a friend, puts himself infront of a radiation explosion.  While recovering in the hospital, he realizes that he's not in pain and feels much better than he ever did.  The downside to the accident is that it gives him the power to turn into a bulging green giant whenever his angry feelings no longer remain supressed.  For someone not knowing anything about the Hulk, I was quite surprised to find myself enjoying this movie. The only bad thing I have to say about this film with the CGI in this film.  It was awful.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Over and Over and Over again I keep seeing(and hearing) negative reviews for this movie and I cannot undertand it at all--There are people who keeps saying that there should not been a RELOADED or most recently a REVOLUTIONS and that it should have stopped with the original movie when if people will remember that THIS MOVIE WAS MEANT AS A TRILOGY!!!!!! The Wachowski Brothers KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING!!! (for those who are lost go and pick up a copy of THE MATRIX:REVISITED) What I have found is that most people were disappointed in this movie and RELOADED because they only were interested in THE MATRIX as just another simple action movie when these movies represent so much more <BR>REVOLUTIONS end is as clearly oultlined and lead up to if you refer back to the first film(those fans of the ORIGINAL) Stop refering to these movies as seperate entities and view them as a whole picture(also view  THE ANIMATRIX--most of you probably hated that too) and then as Morpheus says \\"FREE YOUR MIND\\"<BR> teatyme1@hotmail.com or Tmorpheus1@hotmail.com
0688172377|4.0|Desert Flower<BR> Waris Dirie tells the story of her life, from a world of poverty and the nomad lifestyle, to the pressures of being a super model.  I found her biography to be one of the most compelling books I have ever read.  She is able to tell the remarkable story of her life and in doing so teaches its audience about the struggles that women still face in many other cultures today.  She truly takes advantage of her privilege of living in the United States where as many of American natives take the simple pleasures for granted.<BR> She gives excellent detail in telling her story and captured my attention quickly.  She starts talking about her life as a child and the hardships that were brought upon her living the nomad lifestyle, constant moving around and a father with several wives.  To make matters worse she is attacked and raped several times.  One of the most heart breaking parts of her story is that she had to have Female Genital Mutilation, which is a common practice in Africa, but definitely illegal her in the United States. Through telling of her experiences it helps the readers of the book especially women to be thankful of the rights and freedoms we have today.  <BR> This book is a true inspiration and shows the power and strength of the human spirit and the will to overcome struggles.   The shortcomings are a lot of bad words were used in the book, although I realize sometimes a certain word needs to get a point across to the audience.  That was really the only part that bothered me.  Overall I would rate the book at four stars.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Afterglow has a shimmering soft sonic sheen, and Sarah McLachlan's vocals float like clouds.   But there's something too tasteful and detached about the songs on this album.  And the production and engineering, especially on her vocals, are perfect and predictable to a fault.  There's nothing wrong with the mellow tone, but melodically and lyrically, there's seems to be little memorable distinction from song to song.   There's none of the subtle rhythmic and melodic shifts that elevated her last 2 studio albums to modern singer/songwriter classics.    This is a remarkably soothing album, yet for all its sensitivity, McLachlan sounds emotionally detached.  Lovely, yet lightweight.
B00004VXF2|5.0|It's not noisey music, it's noise. maybe even ambient in the John Cage sense. It's feedback run through amps and speakers (I think), and repetitive of course, but you actually hear it make it's own impossibly fast beat after a while-maybe it's not really ambient after all, since it is actually difficult to ignore. No voice, no melody, no beat (in any obviously accessible way), just a lot of screech!!!!!!...maybe it should be considered a sound effects album, even! This is really stimulating, and one of the more annoying things ever recorded.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|There are a lot of great ideas out there regarding the story of this movie trilogy. The wachowskis are probably sitting back reading what everyone has to say and just loving it. After seeing this movie about 5 more times, (prior to watching revolutions on imax) and taking in a few more reviews, I think I'm close to solving this thing!   Someone spoke of the struggle in the matrix being similar to all these goals we set in life that really don't mean crap.(You don't see Tahitians engaged in class struggles or ladder climbing career moves!) The harder we work, the more life throws at us. The better Neo gets, the better Smith gets. Humans have learned to tap into the machine world, so doesn't it make sense that machines can tap back into the human world (BAIN). Smith learns how to gain control of others, like a virus, which in the first movie he cliams is the problem with humans, (because they HAD CONTROL of machines.) Neo ups the stakes by gaining control of the machines at the end of reloaded. Neo finally realizes at the end of reloaded that his existence is not about being the ONE, or attaining the power of the one. Life is not about goals, it has no meaning, it is simply meant to be lived and loved. Which is why at the very center of this trilogy is a tribal rave/ and love scene. A celebration of life, and its most passionate moment!    For those who have not seen revolutions, I won't divulge anything here, but as you watch any of these movies, know that you will need to see them at least 3 times to take in what is trying to be said. This is so much more than an action movie. sorry if this is scattered, its late!      Bravo!
B000005JA8|5.0|This may be the strangest album I've ever heard. Is is less dangerous than punk rock?? NO. Musically, this goes further, well beyond the 4/4 beats and one dimensional lyrics. It doesn't belong to any genre-there are traces of blues, poetry, and jazz, but the key word is TRACES. Mostly it's just an original thing. I played it for my parants a year ago, and they called it the worst thing they ever heard (they've heard slayer, punk rock, and whatever else, so take their word for it).

B0000AZJXQ|1.0|The UGLIEST album cover in the history of album covers.  The visual downfall is only a foreshadowing for what you're about to hear.  So sad... so so sad!  This is pseudo-artistry at its finest.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|'Afterglow' gets a 3-star rating just on the benefit of Sarah McLachlan's past work and Pierre Merchand's production value.  As songwriting goes - it's sub-par for McLachlan's talents.  Yes, I know she had a child and lost her mother.  But by her own admission, most of these songs are 6 years old - before either of these events.<br />The beauty of her other disks was she alternated styles (to a degree).  There is no &quot;Fear'&quot; &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, or even &quot;Steaming&quot; on this disk.  This album seems to be one big long song - all in style of &quot;Angel&quot; from 'Surfacing'.  One song like that is great.  7 or 8 on one disk - not so much. The vocals themselves are fine...or better than fine. There is very little variation in tempo or vocal style.<br />There is some good material on 'Afterglow'.  &quot;Fallen&quot; is the caliber of what we have come to expect from McLachlan.  &quot;World On Fire&quot; is not the post 9/11 song I would have expected from her (of course, I want to put a temporary ban on all post 9/11 songs for another 5 years).  'Answer' has some extremely trite lyrics (&quot;I won't break, I won't bend.  I know it will be worth it - worth it in the end&quot;???).  I expect way more from her than this.  I will say that the closing cut, &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot;, has something going for it that I can't place my finger on.  I like it.<br />Musically, there is some more interesting stuff than 'Surfacing' but I see hints of repeats from 'Fumbling Towards Ecstasy'.  Chords directly from &quot;Possession&quot; or &quot;Good Enough&quot;.  I know other reviews have said she needs to let loose - and she does: something in the vein of her collaboration w/Delerium on 'Silence'.<br />I'm sure I'll attempt to really connect w/the album, but if it weren't for her past accomplishments - this disk would be getting a 2-star rating from me.
B00005JMFR|2.0|Holly wow... I saw Matrix two days after it came out and I must say, I was truly disapointed.  Some of the dialog in this movie was simply horrible. Pitiful. Hilarious even. \\"You can't die...\\" \\"Yes I can *pause*... UGH\\" Ummm.... right.... ok... moving on... Let's not forget the pointless focus on unimportant characters, such as the reload kid, and the bazooka lady, and also the little girl. I must admit the dock breach scene was amazing and the \\"uber\\" punch at the end with Smith and Neo was quite interesting... but appart from that, the movie was disappointing.  The final fight scene with Smith... can you say Dragon Ball Z? What's with all this flying crap? All there was missing was the screaming and the golden hair... And the bubble explosion effect? Sure it was cool, but that doesn't mean they should use it 8 times in 10 minutes... Also, near the end, they keep switching between scenes, even when the war at the dock is over, and all you wanna know is what the hell is happening with Neo... it's annoying, and long.  This Matrix was truly disapointing... and I think the series truly was a downward spiral.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Just a few things stuck in my head after watching the film:<BR>-The sound of the rain.<BR>-The creaking floor boards as people move around. <BR>-The he-means-business scowl on Clint's half-lit face.<BR>-The gun barrel appearing in the saloon doorway for the showdown.<BR>-The empty whiskey bottle hitting the muddy ground as Clint rides   into town to even the score.<BR>-&quot;I ain't like that no more&quot;<BR>-&quot;We all got it coming,kid&quot;
B00003CXAA|5.0|I wouldn't know how to even begin writing a review of two films that have become cultural icons Godfather Parts I and II are certainly in that category. There is so much here in addition to unforgettable performances by Brando, Pacino, De Niro,Duvall, Cann and so many others. The plot is intricate. The use of flashback sequences has never been utilized to such effect. The sets and the time period are perfectly depicted. The screenplay is so memorable that it is often quoted and used as a reference in other films and everyday speech. This DVD collection is beautifully packaged and the transfer to DVD is flawless. The extras included are well done and interesting. Overall I'd have to say this is a great investment and one of my prized possesions. Any serious film lover deserves to have this in their collection.
0743424425|5.0|Have you ever read a book that was impossible to stop reading? I have and it was Stephen King's The Shining. The master of horror is good about writing books that you just can't put down.  The novel is about a family that goes to take care of a huge hotel during the off-season.  They are not informed that the hotel is ahunted until the last person is about to leave.  The little boy of the family has the ability to &quot;shine,&quot; which is the ability to see and communicate with the people that had been murdered in the hotel. The little boyalso had an imaginary friend by the name of Tony that played a big part later on in the book. The story contains the famous line &quot;Redrum, Redrum, Redrum&lt;&quot;which is murder spelled backwards: aslo it is a sign of bad things to come.  The storyline pulled me right in and i could not stop reading.<BR>   The suspense of The Shining is intense.  King leaves you right on the edge of your seat.  There is a chapter in the book where the little boy rides his big wheel past the room that the murders had taken place. He began to hear voices and saw apparitions at the end of the hall. He peddled as fast as his little legs would take him to get away. Even though he peddled  as hard as he could, he could not seem to escape the voices. I wondered if the apparitions were actually going to kill him, but they had other things on their minds.  I had to keep reading, that night I think I probably read eight to nine chapters.  I could not put the book down to save my life. <BR>   The storyline and plot were absolutely astounding.  King uses the most descriptive words and phrases.  This book made me feel like I was the one there. I could picture the very scenes and conversations that were taking place.  I love how King ends the chapters, he was able to keep me wandering what would happen next.<BR>   The story continues with horror and fear being bestowed into the family's lives away from home.  Stephen King definitely knows how to throw you thorough many loops while reading his books. There are many parts to this book that shocked me and at times scared me a little. At one point in time the mother and son are out walking through a hedge maze that was builit behind the massive hotel. The mother turned around and all of a sudden her son was gone. She began screaming his name and going in circles. WEhen all of a sudden he just reappears.  His untrustworthy imaginary friend talked him into leavign so they coul dgo have a talk. Yeah I know, it's kind of weird but King makes it so appealing that I felt like he had pulled me into his world.  The father is trying to write a novel at the same time he is supposed to be performing keep-ip duties on the vast hotel.  The spirits eventually start speaking to him, which ends up being the worst thing that could happen.<BR>   The novel seems to just gradually flow to the next sequence, rather that having a great deal of flashbacks, like some of King's other works. He keeps you in the present story. King told the story of the family at the very beginning and kept sequence after sequence going strong throughout the book.  This novel was a very interesting tale of the supernatural and how it can possess other people. King has a very proficient mind to come up with some of the books that he has written. The Shining is a book that you need to just take a whole day to read and use a great deal of imagination to allow yourself to be drawn into his writings.<BR>   Hang inthere when you first start the book because it starts off rather slow.  Once it hits about half way through the third chapter it starts to pick upand gets a little out of the ordinary. If someone is looking for a good book that you can not stop reading I suggest Stephen King's The Shining.
B00005JM02|5.0|I just rewatched this movie with my dad and lil' sister and I always find it funny to read the 1-star reviews when the movie's really highly rated. 3 of the most amusing ones:<BR>#1: Someone saying, &quot;Wow, this was a bad ocean documentary.&quot; Get a clue, this is a KIDDIE FILM! This is NOT &quot;Splendor of the Seas&quot;... Jeez...<BR>#2: Some African-American person decided that this was a racial movie because the pelicans were white and the fish were different colored and the pelicans had to save the fish... SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU EVER MET AN ORANGE PELICAN! GIMME A BREAK!<BR>#3: This guy and his wife buying the movie without having seen it and deciding it was boring. Sure, a lot of the jokes are aimed at older people like teen/adult range, but in essence, this is a KID film! I cannot say that enough! I am still young enough to appreciate it but not old enough to think it was boring...<BR>This movie has vibrant beautiful animation that looks so real that you want to go up and touch the screen. The stereotypes displayed in the fish amused me such as &quot;chronic memory loss&quot;, &quot;neat freak&quot;, and &quot;over-protective parent&quot;. It's a really cute movie that's great to watch with your younger sibs or kids or whatever. Read the 4 and 5 star reviews, a lot of the others have nooooooooooo idea what they're talking about...
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Anyone who knows anything about good music owns this album. It is just that simple. On &quot;Blood On The Tracks,&quot; we hear Dylan at his most vulnerable and emotional. It is a very sad album as it is about his divorce to wife Sara but it is written from such a deep personal level that it becomes poetry that can speak to anyone who has gone through a similar situation. Most people labeled Dylan as a social critic and writer in the 60s but here, Dylan speaks from the bottom of his heart that few artists have managed to do without falling into a hole of obscurity and sappiness. &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; is without a doubt one of Dylan's top five albums of all time and one of the greatest albums ever. Like I said starting my review, if you like good music then you own &quot;Blood On The Tracks.&quot;
B000088E6D|5.0|This cd must be recognized! It's flawless and beautiful to listen to. Having had the good fortune to hear M.B. sing live I knew his first major release would impress! And M.B. doesn't disappoint. Incredible rich vocals....M.B. has the most pleasing voice I've EVER heard. Sorry Sinatra, you were my #1 until now.<br />Producers Foster, Anka and Gattica show their talents as well - to take the variety of songs they did and make each song sound as if they were just written for M.B. takes some kind of skill. <BR>Orchestrations are beautiful and just the greatest compliment to the making of beautiful music.<br />Bublé, Foster, et al - you've created a winner - please give us more &amp; soon!! (I'd love to hear M.B. &amp; Norah or Krall duet)
B00005JMFI|4.0|James Caan is always perfect. The older he gets; the better he gets. I really enjoyed going to the movies with my family without worrying wheter there would be filthy language or nudity. It seems like most comedians think throwing a few choice off color words make the movie more appealing. Not so! Parents and Grandparents can take thier kids to see this movie.
B00005JMFR|3.0|...but that's about all the praise I can give this movie.<br />When I first saw The Matrix in the theaters back in 1999, it was everything that Star Wars Episode 1 wasn't: thought-provoking ideas, mind-bending action sequences, swift pacing and a great plot.  Roughly four years later, the Wachowski brothers are making the same mistakes that George Lucas is making.  In Reloaded we were given some great action sequences (the freeway chase is one of my all-time favorite action scenes); but what the movie had in spades, namely, pseudo-philosophical gibberish that might impress someone who didn't take Philosophy 110 for their Humanities requirement and a string of seemingly pointless characters (Persephone?  The Merovingian? The Keymaker?) the audience didn't want or need.  At least Reloaded's conclusion left the possibility that Revolutions would wrap-up all of the loose ends.<br />Unfortunately, the directors did not answer any of the important questions raised by the first two films and introduced even more characters and scenes that leave the viewer wondering who these people were and why were they so important.  Why do we waste 15 minutes of Neo talking to a Hindi family?  How do the Merovingian and Persephone fit into the whole scheme?  Why is there no explanation of Neo's powers in the real world?  Will humans be liberated from the Matrix now?<br />The movie itself is mildly entertaining.  It has some great fight scenes (unfortunately, none of which match the intensity of the freeway chase in Reloaded) and spectacular special effects, but the acting is overly-reliant on cliched one-liners (\\"You did it,\\" \\"No, we did it\\" etc.) that made me cringe everytime I heard one.  The final fight between Neo and Agent Smith is entertaining and has fantastic visuals, but far too short and leaves me wondering \\"Why didn't Neo just do that in the first place?\\"  <br />So, if you turn off your mind to any of the questions raised by the first two Matrix movies, Revolutions works as an so-so sci-fi action movie with some really cool fights and effects.  But one that pales in comparison to the original \\"breath-of-fresh- air\\" that the first Matrix was!
0394806220|5.0|I don't think there's one Dr. Seuss book that I can't recall being read to me when I was  somewhere in the under-10 age.  Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You? stands out in particular.  How could a child forget the first time mom makes those delightful noises to go with the pictures in a book?  It's the stuff of high comedy and intense interest to three-year-olds everywhere.<br />Mr. Brown is a funny little man dressed to the nines (in dapper brown of course) who can imitate all sorts of noises like a wiz.  You'd better be prepared to go beyond barnyard animal sounds, too - lightening cracks, goldfish kisses, and a hippo chewing gum (which is GRUM GRUM, for those of you who don't know!). The book prompts children to try and match Mr. Brown's sounds in a nice, low-pressure way.<br /> I'm not sure if this book has ever received official recognition for its educational value to young children, but as far as I'm concerned MBCMCY is a wonderful tool for teaching kids to be better observers, listeners, and responders to their surroundings.  Better yet, it introduces parents to the fine art of interactive reading.<br />-(...)
B000007T1M|5.0|Me, I'm a metalhead. But, I'm a really picky metalhead. To me, Limp Bizkit, Korn, etc. they all suck. Nu-metal has to really WOW me before I can consider it excellent. All that aside, I can say without a doubt in my mind, that System of a Down has WOWed me. I bought Toxicity as soon as my friend showed me the album. It was only a matter of time before I was to go back in time. Compared to Toxicity, their self titled endeavor is much more raw. Also to note that it is much more profane. It starts simple with Suite-Pee, a great opener complete with a funky intro similar to an old video game. It swings quickly into Know, a cult classic that you'll be content to listen to each time you play the CD. Next is SOAD's national anthem, Sugar. It is possibly the best song on the CD and definately one of System's greatest. Suggestions and the pop-crowd favorite, Spiders follow and serve as concert regulars. Ddevil is a hilarious song and is great to sing along to. Soil is one of my personal favorites, simply because the guitar-work is phenomanal. War? follows and is a riffy SOAD song. Mind, my #1 pick on the album, is next and is certainly SOAD's all-time heaviest song. Peephole is cool, but it's very confusing, and Darts serves as another really catchy song. The CD finishes strong with P.L.U.C.K., a very personal song for the band. All in all, you shouldn't purchase this CD if you perfer System of a Down's lighter stuff or if you cannot handle hearing them say &quot;F--- this and F--- that&quot;. But you shouldn't buy this if you love the American government. Otherwise, this is an album that all metalheads who aren't impressed by bands that suckup to the media should buy without delay. If you are a fan of Rage Against the Machine or even if you're a punk, you have even more reason's to buy this CD. &quot;I had an out-of-body experience, the other day, her name was Jesus. And for her, every one cried, every one cried, every one cried!&quot;
B00005JMFR|3.0|I have been debating whether or not the get \\"Reloaded\\" on DVD.  Now that I've seen \\"Matrix: Revolutions\\", I know that I can save my money.  \\"Revolutions\\" was a very o.k. film.  Not terrible, but not great either.<br />The bad part first.  The dialogue, acting, and character direction in this film is the worst of the three.  I'm going to try to word this as spoiler free as possible.  We all know at the end of \\"Reloaded\\" that Agent Smith had somehow possessed a human (Bane, I think?).  We all know from the preview (and intuition) that Neo will eventually confront him.  What we didn't know is that it will take Neo forever to figure out who he is...even though he's calling him \\"Mr. Anderson\\", and talks about stinky human flesh, and uses the same way of speaking as Agent Smith, etc.  Neo still spends an eternity going \\"Who are you?...No!...Who Are you?...No!\\"  Also, in the running it into the ground category, is the new Oracle.  Unfortunately the actress playing the first oracle, Gloria Foster, died during the filming of the last two matrix films.  They explain the new actress decently once, the audience buys it, and we can move on...except for the fact that EVERY character who encounters her in the film has to comment on her \\"new look\\".  Then there's that conversation between Neo and Trinity at the end (you'll know it when you see it) which seems like it will never end.  It wasn't moving...just tedious.  The acting through out is either completely stiff (Neo, Trinity) or overly enthusiastic (The \\"Kid\\").  I can't blame the actors completely, though, because the dialogue is very poorly written.<br />Now that I've seen all the movies and the Animatrix, I still don't understand why the Merovingian character was necessary...at all.  I forgot if there was a point to \\"The Last Exile\\".  This movie seemed to go over the obvious ad nauseam, and then gloss over things that may have been interesting.  The old hippie Jedi*cough*Zion council seemed pointless in the scheme of things.The old white guy kept looking like he was waiting in anticipation of something about to happen, but the viewer never really knew what it was (I guess \\"the prophecy\\"...which we never were really told what that was either).<br />O.k., you get the idea.  Time for the good bits.  I'm one of those annoying people who usually complains that movies have too many effects, and not enough story.  This is one of the few cases that I'll say that the effects were amazing, exciting, and I wish there could have been more of them.  The Chase, the Battle for Zion, and the Battle vs. Smith all worked for me.  Through all the mud, the point of the movie does eventually shine through.  This is mostly seen through the words of Smith and the actions of Neo.  The movie does end the trilogy conclusively.  Sing Ngai as Seraph (ha ha) is just plane cool.<br />As I said.  It's not great, but it's not terrible either.  I don't think it would be worth owning this movie when the DVD comes out.  It's good to watch once or twice.  The first \\"Matrix\\" is still a fantastic film, and stands very well on it's own.  For me, at least, that (and the \\"Animatrix\\") are the only parts of the Matrix world that I think I'd like to visit again and again.
B0000CC5CS|5.0|I saw this in the movie theatres only five months ago and now I will add this to my collection! I own Everything on the TERMINATOR  series.
B00005JM02|5.0|What a fun story and a great depiction of &quot;fatherhood&quot; in a society where the role of &quot;Dad&quot; is too easily dismissed.  The graphics are really amazing, and the voices of Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenares are a perfect match for the characters they play.  The producers did a really incredible job in putting together a story that is engaging, fun and moving.<br />The other characters are great, including my personal favorite the sea turtle (a dead ringer for Spicoli in Fast Times), the other fish in the tank with Nemo, and the sea gulls with their &quot;mine, mine, mine, mine&quot; calls.  Too funny.<br />A great film for the whole family, although little ones may find some of the scenes a bit too intense.  My two year old was scared in a couple of scenes.  Overall though, a home run for Disney on this one!!
B00006BXI0|5.0|Although I gave a 5 for this disk I have to say that V is a little better, even though V doesn't have an amazing 20-minute epic. I did get this CD before V too, and at that specific period in my life (age 12)I was taking a radical step from nu-metal crap like linkin park to this amazing music, and so it took me a while to get me turned on to it. And from that moment on my life was changed!!<BR>In my opinion, all the tracks are great (some more than others, mind you, such as Of Sins and Shadows, Accolade and Candlelight Fantasia). What is weird is that some of the songs on DWoT sort of &quot;match up&quot; to V: &quot;Of Sins and Shadows&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot; (two smokin' speed metal opening tracks), &quot;Accolade&quot; and &quot;Communion on the Oracle&quot; (two mystical slower songs that almost have identical intro riff patterns), &quot;Eyes of Medusa&quot; and &quot;Cataclysm&quot; (roaring vocals and grinding guitars), &quot;Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;Egypt&quot; (obviously Egyptian sounding songs), among many other similarities. So it sort of sounds like these two albums were made simultaneously (i haven't got Twilight in Olympus).<BR>As amazing as ever, the musicians execute the songs almost flawlessy, amazing solos by Romeo and Pinella perfect note for note, and Russel Allen's awesome voice still razor sharp as ever. There is a slight difference in the sound and effects used by Michael Pinella, but this doesn't change his etheral soloing and love for the spotlight.<BR>I think that's enough reviewing for now. This and V are my only two albums from the band, and from what i've heard, Odyssey beats them both, and Twilight is great but not as good. I have yet to draw my own conclusion, and so if you are new to the world of Symphony X, I suggest you buy either of these, which are hailed as the tru classics of the band. Either way, Symphony X rules just the same! Peace!!
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie has a plot as well as action and some special effects.  The Matrix was all special effects.  The story is based upon a book &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; by Ira Levin. Unfortunately he isn't credited for it by the producers.  It is basicly a story about individualism versus totalitarianism with some very entertaining plot twists.
B0000AMJEH|1.0|This movie wasn't much without Vin Diesel.  Tyrese was funny, but Paul Walker should have had Vin to back him up in his acting.  The cars were great, but Eva Mendes can't make up for the abscence of Vin and Michelle Rodriguez.  Better luck with the next movie, guys.  Make it more worth our time to watch.
B000063UR2|3.0|I thought the movie was well done. The artistry in the set, costumes, makeup was excellent.  It seemed like the target audience were 13 year old girls.  For small children - too much viloence.  For older adults - puerile and childish.  I shouldn't slam this movie too much.  The scenes between the devil and the girl were excellent. Probably the best I've seen in any movie.  After having read some of the other reviews about the international release and the domestic US release much is explained.  I watched the domestic realease. It seemed chopped. Scenes did not flow together well. I plan to see the international release.
B000099T2L|4.0|I was really impressed with Beyonce's debut solo album. The entire CD is well put together. I listen to it every morning when I wake up, and I listen to it every night before I go to sleep. It is my favorite R&amp;B CD next to Alicia Key's Songs in A Minor. My favorite track from Dangerously in Love is Speechless.
B00005JMFR|4.0|I'm sure by now you have read all the other reviews flaming the movie for a variety of reasons. if you go into the movie expecting the movie to be as ground breaking as the first one then you will be disappointed. Guess what everyone, the ground was already broken by the first matrix. The purpose of the second and third movies in a trilogy is to advance the plot not to invent something new. Bad acting? overly long shootouts? cheesy lines in a pleasant overacting sauce? Not any worse than the first matrix. <br />now that I've got that out of the way, there were some notable faults in the movie. Like Matrix Reloaded, the \\"pep talks\\" in Zion were overdone and lacking in substance. lets face it, Patton is AWOL. The \\"touching emotional scenes\\" felt about 30 minutes too long. during one death scene I found myself thinking \\"just die already!\\" Not exactly the desired effect I believe. during the final fight scene the special effects (while cool) were way overdone. SFX should support the fight not the other way around. It would have been nice to see a little military strategy in the real world battle scenes. as it stands it had all the forethought of pre-revolutionary war battle lines. There was no maneuvering to speak of, no combined arms tactics, very little use of cover or concealment, and no changes to the original plan (if you can call \\"stand in a line in the open at shoot the enemy a plan). <br />on a brighter note, the plot was actually pretty decent for an action movie. The further divergence from the strict \\"it is prophesy\\" themes in the first half of the series was a welcome change. it was especially welcome that victory was not assured just because he is \\"The One\\". By the end of the movie I realized that several elements seemed to be heavily influenced by the Dune books (by Frank Herbert). Fans of that series may get additional enjoyment noticing parallels between the two.  <br />all in all, the movie is worth admission but realize that it is just a continuation of the first two movies. Don't expect Reeves to suddenly learn how to act and don't expect anything earth shattering. Just go in to see how it all ends up.
B0000028M7|5.0|Simply brilliant. If you don't have it, get it.
B000000WF0|5.0|All of the accolades that this album rightfully deserves have already been written here. I can only reiterate how outstanding this album is on so many levels--lyrically, technically, artistically, etc. I'm a harsh critic, but this is a special album deserving of its recognition. I've listed to the album for many years and have never tired of it. &quot;Velvet Morning&quot; is easily my favorite song...seeing it performed live in Hammerstein Ballroom in NYC was a near religious experience!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Very good movie.  Very intense action, but like the first two installments the plot is paramount.  You can't take this movie at face value.  It requires thought and analysis - and if you are able to give it some thought, I think you will enjoy it.  I would also recommend checking out Reloaded within a day or so of going to see Revolutions.<BR> <BR>Revolutions is Neo's continuing quest to figure out his purpose.  The basic plot starts out in two directions - first, the machines moving towards Zion attempting to destroy the remaining humans who are freed.  In addition, Agent Smith has made his way out of the Matrix into the \\"real world\\" in the form of Bane.  Neo has found that his powers exists outside of the Matrix and now Smith has done the same.  I equate Smith to a computer virus that continues to adapt.  Smith is Neo's dramatic foil and the Oracle tells Neo that he and Smith are \\"negative twins\\".  <BR> <BR>Break for the very long intense fight between the humans and machines.  Great battle scene (despite no Neo or Trinity).  Suspense builds as we wonder if Zion can hold off the machines long enough to get support from Niobe & Morpheous.  <BR> <BR>After the fight, Neo makes peace with the machines by telling the machines that Smith is a threat to the machine world just as he is the matrix (at this point, Smith has overtaken the matrix).  The machines then allow Neo to go into the Matrix and attempt to eliminate Smith - in the second film, Smith had adapted and was stronger (than he was in the first film) - unable to be destroyed by Neo.  The big question is how will Neo destroy Smith and what will the implications be.  The way Smith was finally destroyed was very profound.  <BR> <BR>Inside the Matrix, Smith overtook the Oracle, just as he had done to about everyone else inside the Matrix.  We even saw some foreshadowing here, Smith (sounding frustrated) asked the Oracle \\"if you knew I was coming for you, why would you still be here\\".  This was the Oracle's choice,and she knew that allowing Smith to overtake her would ultimately lead to his demise.  The oracle said to Neo earlier, \\"Everything that has a beginning also has an end\\".  <BR> <BR>Another cool fight scene between Neo and Smith.  Just as Neo was lying on the ground and nearly defeated, he finally realized how to defeat Smith.  This realization came about when Smith said (standing over Neo), \\"I am now supposed to say - 'everything that has a beginning also has an end'\\".  Neo then allowed Smith to overtake him, and then the machines pulled the plug that linked Neo into the Matrix.  By pulling the plug, the machines killed Neo and since Smith had overtaken Neo, this ultimately killed Smith.  Thus, Neo (major symbolism here - Neo is Christ-like) dies to save everyone else.  Smith dies and everyone inside the Matrix that Smith had overtaken turned back into themselves - hence the Oracle lying on the ground where Smith was slain.<BR> <BR>A cut scene shows the matrix \\"repairing\\" itself.  The Oracle is sitting on a bench next to Seraph and the little girl (all of whom were earlier overtaken by Smith) and the architect tells the Oracle that she found a creative way to beat Smith.  The end.  <BR> <BR>Conclusion - The matrix still exists.  Big question - was the architect correct when he said at the end of Reloaded that Neo is an anomaly of the Matrix and that 5 others came before him and more will come after him?  The little girl (sorry, can't remember her name) asks the Oracle if they will see Neo again and the Oracle says \\"I think so\\".  <BR> <BR>All we know is that the Matrix still exists and that for now the freed humans and the machines are going to coexist.  Another question - will the machines continue to use humans for energy, or will those humans be freed - stay tuned...I think there is more to come. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>There is a ton of Matrix philosophy on the this web site.  But it is limited to the first film.<BR> <br />[...]<BR> <BR>On the top right, go to the mainframe and then click the box that says philosophy.  A good article on the religious symbolism is \\"Wake Up!\\" by Flannery-Dailey & Wagner.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Great movie, it reminds me a little of an earlier Lynch film LOST HIGHWAY, which also dealt with the theme of people unable to remember, or perhaps deliberately blocking, something terrible they'd done or something that had been done to them.  But this one has a better story to it, I think.<br />The first 90 minutes is almost like a Nancy Drew mystery story, with the ultra-perky blonde, wanna-be actress (you can imagine her expostulating things like, &quot;Oh golly!&quot; and &quot;Gee whiz!&quot;, though I don't recall if she actually goes quite that far) helping an amnesia victim recover her memory.  Then the story takes a major, psychologically disturbing turn into Dark Weirdness in the last hour or so.  Several very &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; scenes in the film, particularly with the surreal music show in front of the red curtains and also the dwarf wearing the cowboy outfit.  <br />I was browsing through some of the earlier reviews, looking at some of the interpretations others have of the film.  My own involves a cyclic life/punishment theory, where the characters are repeatedly given the opportunity to make decisions and then punished when they make the wrong choice.  Remember, the cowboy guy says something to the director like, &quot;If you choose right, you will see me one more time.  If you choose wrong, you will see me two more times.&quot;  And the part where the assassin tells the girl, &quot;If you give me the money, it's a done deal.  You sure you want this?&quot;  And she says:  &quot;More than anything in this life.&quot;
068484267X|5.0|If you can make it through the first 100 pages of &quot;Angela's Ashes,&quot; then the rest is much easier. This isn't because it's poorly-written.  Far from it; &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; quickly captures the reader with a unique and compelling voice. The difficulty is that the first part of the book is tragic beyond words... and yet Frank McCourt has found words which capture the tragedy of his early years with ruthless honesty.<br />In bone-clean prose, McCourt details the events of his early childhood, first in America and then in Ireland. His story is an interesting one, to be sure, but the most notable thing about it is the way he tells it. McCourt's straightforward style perfectly portrays how a child sees the world and his family. Especially early on, there is no moralizing or judgment; events simply happen, often for no discernible reason (although reasons are clear to the reader). As McCourt grows, so the prose becomes more complex, and his understanding of what is happening to his family crystallizes.<br />McCourt also does a great job capturing the rhythm and cadence of dialogue and regional accents, especially the Irish way of speaking English. While reading the book's dialogue sequences, a reader can hear the people speaking in their inner ear, can hear the thick Irish accents of some, the clear English of others. Simply put, Frank McCourt has one of the finest ears for dialogue of any writer I've ever read.<br />The imagery of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is simple but vibrant, the story moving and very, very real. It is, in many ways, a difficult book to read, but that is simply because it is so well-written, and portrays a difficult subject with honesty and clarity. One finishes the book wishing that more writers could write this clearly, but even more important, the reader understands what Frank McCourt went through as he grew to a young man. If that reader is anything like me, it will make them very thankful for what they have.
0064400557|5.0|I am letting my six year old daughter do this review... I liked charlotte's Web because it is a really good story. I liked the funny parts about Templeton and when Lurvy chases Wilber and tries to put him back into his pen. I also liked when Charlotte saved Wilber by writing in her web. It was sad at the end but I also felt happy when Wilber made new friends. This would be a good book for other kids to read because it's a a story of friendship. Good job, now it's time for bed!

0156027321|4.0|I like to read and often read a book a day. Sometimes it is hard to find new books that are worth reading especially when you have never heard of the author and the book doesn't fall easily into a catagory. This book did not dissapoint. It discriptions of India and young Pi's life were written in an interesting style. The soul searching journey that he goes on as a castaway keeps you reading chapter after chapter. I think that many readers will be surprised at the end as I was.
B000002U82|4.0|As a devoted Pink Floyd fan, this album truly resonates with me. Not only is it some of the best music that Floyd ever wrote, but it's very diverse. Rather than being all &quot;super-slow rock ballads&quot; as some have suggested, it shows a great variety of styles, from the slow, chilled-out melodies of &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; to the up-tempo, rhythmic sounds and bass of &quot;Money&quot;. It is an all-around great album, for longtime fans looking for a bit of variety to new listners who are searching for something easier to diegest than &quot;The Wall&quot; -- which is, by the way, an excellent album if you have intellect to understand it.
0792833260|5.0|i cried so hard at the end. i just loved this movie. Dustin Hoffman rules.
0385507755|1.0|Stylistically awful, kind of pretend-punchy Hemmingway meets Elmore Leonard (but without the talent), with the most irritating syntax and repetition. Market-driven drivel, really. The narrator comes across as a brat. There's no interior subtlety. No real inner world beyond the self-obsessed, self-indulgent anger that drives the narrative. It becomes pretty indigestible by half-way through. I noticed Nan Talese is thanked in the acknowledgements. I guess everyone is entitled to a bad day. Or that even good editors will sell out if the market looks like it gives a green light. This book stinks of the quick buck. Anyway there's nothing it's going to add to the sum total of the world's literature. Bet you any money this Bile Brat-Boy can't come up with a second novel that's any better. (And if the book really is true, it's hard to believe this guy hasn't relapsed by now -- which, one imagines, would make it hard to even get that second novel started.)<br />Who the hell made the decision to left-justify all the paragraphs? It's an unspeakably annoying habit. Is this the new in-house signal for &quot;groovy cutting edge&quot; in publishing?<br />I give the book one star, in a sense because the hilariously bad ending, when Frey &quot;Just Says No&quot;, is such a classic of bad literature and is worth reading for a belly laugh. But you could do that standing in the bookshop. Try and imagine the Hollywood violins, amping up the emotions, in this scene in the film version of this book, which you can be sure will follow.<br />If you want the real goods, a truly beautiful masterpiece on the addicted soul, I suggest &quot;Candy&quot; by Luke Davies is the one to read. It's an extraordinary and moving book. Deeply affecting, and we identify deeply, even those of us who have no experience of addiction. There's nothing really &quot;moving&quot; about Frey's limp memoir.
0156027321|5.0|I was not really looking forward to this read, but I am reading it for book club, so I had no choice.  At first I was slightly interested, but by the time I reached page 30, (which didn't take long as this is a fast read)I was hooked for my entire Saturday!  The book keeps you thinking; several times I found myself going back in the book to re-read the italicized chapters, especially 21 and 22.  Further, much of the lamenting Pi does earlier in the book is revisited in Pi's behavior after the shipwreck.  This was a very pleasant book which left me feeling serene; I did not want this book to end!
B000000OTU|4.0|This is kind of an odd collection. It's not career-spanning, and only takes the hits from &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, &quot;Pump&quot;, and &quot;Get A Grip&quot;. But if you're a fan of their early 90's work, this is for you. Included is &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Love In An Elevator&quot;, and &quot;Cryin'&quot;, as well as &quot;Dude (looks like a lady)&quot;, &quot;Janie's Got A Gun&quot;, and &quot;Livin' On The Edge&quot;. Plus many more, including a few new songs. &quot;Dueces Are Wild&quot; is really good. Pretty much all these songs are on the 2-disc collections, but if this is the era you like, then you'll love &quot;Big Ones&quot;. It would go perfect with the earlier &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album.
0156027321|5.0|i started this book thinking i was reading one story, and when i put it down, it didn't strike me as all that powerful. but, since i was reading this for my school bookclub, i went to the meeting and discovered a whole new side to it, and the story was much more interesting and unique to me. when you read this book, ask yourself &quot;who is pi?&quot; and think about the book on deeper levels. :) i'd definitly recommend it to a group for discussion.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I don't know if I can call this the masterpiece of 2002 that others have, but it is extremely good. It does take a few listens to really appreciate though. All the songs I like, but my favorites are &quot;Kamera&quot;, &quot;War on War&quot;, &quot;Jesus, etc.&quot;, and of course &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot;. I can relate to that song, because I've seen a few bands on the riverfront in St. Louis myself. This doesn't sound too much like the &quot;Jeff Tweedy&quot; we knew from &quot;Uncle Tupelo&quot;, but it will go great with the recent &quot;Beck&quot; and &quot;Flaming Lips&quot; albums.
B00005JMFR|4.0|The Matrix Revolutions has some of the best action. It is so much better than Reloaded, and about equal to the first Matrix. The scenes with Niobe flying the ship is hot, and the battle between the Machines and Humans is great. The final battle is awesome too, as well as trinity,morpheus, and Seraph in the club. You have to go see this movie, but you need to see the first 2 before watching this one.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I loved Beautiful and I've been waiting forever to get this cd and I finally got around to getting it.  Just that song is enough to buy the cd, but the other songs are great too. It's different, but in a good way.  You won't be disappointed. People should give this cd to young girls, it's really inspirational.  Should make great stocking stuffers!
B0000A36J5|5.0|I'm truly sorry for those people who did not like peter jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's masterpiece(I don't mean this in a sarcastic kind of way). Me being the person who watched LOTR movies without thinking about the details, found the movies to be extremely good. Although I did read the books before the idea came of making these movies, I was just a child so can't remember the details but I remember the basic story and how much I enjoyed it. I think you will enjoy this movie if you have or haven't read Tolkien's books. I personally enjoyed every minute of the movie, and so I enjoy the special extended edition even more. There is not a scene i would take out nor things I would add (except make the prequel). If you don't enjoy the LOTR movies then I don't know of any recent movies that you could enjoy. If you like battle sequences look no farther, these movies have it all. If you want a love story these movies are full of love. These movies invented the word adventure...
B00005JMFR|3.0|First up- The Original Matrix is my all time favourite. Second- When I first saw Reloaded, I was disappointed; it took 3-4 viewings to grasp it, then I enjoyed it. Third- I have only seen Revolutions once, I am sure it will take another two viewings at least to fully grasp it all.<BR>Conclusion? I'm not 100% certain! And probably won't be until I have seen it more. The Original Matrix has always been five stars all the way, with the second definately good- But not great three stars.<BR>The Third I think will fall into that good but not great slot. Perhaps it's simply an unfair case of the first film being SO good that they really were on a hiding to nothing with the sequels; the gut feeling maybe they should never have existed really comes to mind here.<BR>To the point though, if you liked Reloaded you will like Revolutions, as it is really the second half of the four hour movie. The SFX are incredible-In this modern Cinema world of Jaw dropping effects it has been a long time since a movie has blown me away like that.<BR>The main problems with it are the drawn out story around the main war; Matrix II & III really could have been pushed into a single movie...And in some places, where the main characters are missing from the action during the big fights, it kind of feels 'Independance Day'-like. Lots of cheesy dialogue and big effects.<BR>Having said that, when it's good it's very good. I like the Philosophy aspect as most Matrix fans do, and I thought the plot was a good, fitting end to the series. I get the feeling a lot of critics have slagged it because (A) Those people like everything explained for them, without ambiguous 'discussion points', and (B) They wanted a Star Wars-ish happy ending with all our Heroes receiving medals on a stage. The Matrix was always too dark a story to do that.<BR>Overall, it's a good movie which was never, EVER going to live up to the hype. But please, dear Brothers...Pay attention to the 'Tomb Raider' video games- Enough is enough,don't destroy the franchise by thrashing it.
0451169514|4.0|IT is a very scary book, the kind of book that makes you notice the noises your home makes when you're trying to sleep...<br />The book showcases characterization, especially with the bad guys.  Tom Rogan, Henry Bowers, and several of the 7 main characters' parents are no exception.  They are real evil, in human form, and provide a powerful tangible foil to the creepy, mysterious IT and it's various forms.  <br />The 7 kids (kids in 1958, adults in 1985) are also richly developed.  By the end, the reader is deeply connected to these &quot;losers&quot;.  <br />While I recommend this book to any and all non-sqeamish readers, it is not without its flaws.  The book's principal flaw is that it could stand some trimming.  At 1100 pages, IT is certainly a daunting challenge.  Some repetition could have been avoided, and perhaps there are just a few too many characters.<br />But the thing that bothered me the most is the same thing that always gets me with Harry Potter...  At the end of the first Harry Potter book, we learn that all his power against Voldemort is because of HIS MOTHER'S LOVE...  Gag, gag.  IT uses the power of a child's imagination in a similar way, and it deflated much of the horror for me.  This book is very creepy and scary, but that terror could have been maintained throughout the entire book with a little less about imagination.  Instead, the book hits a lull in the 800s and then gets on a full head of steam again in the 900s.<br />Overall, an enjoyable (is that really the word when you're freaked out?) read, and highly recommended.
B00006RU5B|3.0|On paper, Audioslave sounds like the ideal fusion of the talents present in Rage Against The Machine and Soundgarden. Wrap your head around the potential--the talents of Rage guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Cumberfield, and drummer Brad Wilk (maybe not as talented as the rhythm team of Ben Shepard/Matt Cameron, but more than adequate) with the soaring vocal prescence of Chris Cornell instead of Zach De La Rocha's harsh rapping. Good idea, right?<br />It should be said that I am a fan of both bands, and both had their own unique values and characteristics that endeared them to me. I enjoyed RATM's political message and the unique feel that Zach added, and I loved Soundgarden's &quot;Black Sabbath-meets-Led Zeppelin by way of Seattle&quot; sound too. But Audioslave, in the end, does these influences a disservice by being inferior to both bands.<br />The lyrics ditch the political aspects in favor of philosophical/mystical subject matter, and I'm fine with that. The problem is that the sum of the band members just isn't as strong as it should be here. While Tom Morello's guitar work is still unique and powerful (listen to that solo on Like A Stone and try telling me you don't get goosebumps), the rest of the band feels somewhat uninspired. The rhythm section is solid but dull compared to their work with RATM, pretty much just bashing out imitations of what they did before. Most importantly, Chris Cornell's voice has degenerated badly since his Soundgarden days, and has become much too raspy. He's lost his patented banshee howls, and while his softer vocals are passable they certainly aren't as powerful. The overall effect is that of a second-rate Soundgarden.<br />Alright, perhaps I'm being too critical, as there is enough good material on this debut to make it worth buying. The opener and single Cochise is a great song to start, and it's followed by good tracks like Gasoline, Like A Stone, Exploder, I Am The Highway, and Hypnotize (which features neat, almost spoken word vocals). My pick for favorite is Shadow On The Sun, which features a mind-blowing solo and shows what this band *could* create if they put some more work into it.<br />I'll throw this album a three-star score. Looking at it from the angle of a brand-new band, this is a good debut (especially given its mainstream competition). However, as a Soundgarden/RATM fan, it is very disappointing to see this level of talent go to waste. I won't write them off just yet, as their upcoming second album may be a lot better. For now I give this album a tentative recommendation.spoken word vocals).

0385504209|3.0|The Da Vinci Code is far from perfect, but that didn't keep me from flipping all 400+ pages in an afternoon.  This book has much to offer:<br />1.) Interesting facts about artwork, the golden proportion, cryptography<br />2.) Details enough about Freemasonry, the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, and the Knights Templar to make budding consipiracy theorists salivate<br />3.) Plenty of red herrings and foreshadowing to keep you guessing and revising your guesses<br />4.) Excellent pacing<br />Some readers may find the short chapters unusual, but they work well in maintaining multiple concurrent threads.  The result is a page-turner in the truest sense--the reader almost feels as if he is in the same desperate chase as the characters.<br />The Da Vinci Code is far from perfect, however.  The writing sometimes calls attention to itself, and the author often pauses the narrative to provide backstory and history lesson.  The lines between historical fact and pure fiction are intentionally blurry, but that may be unsettling to some (devout) readers.  And some scenes, including the ending, an interrogation early in the novel, and a climactic scene at Westminster Abbey, seem contrived.<br />Also--don't believe anything Brown says about Harvard...<br />Overall, this is a fun and entertaining book that doesn't deserve the harsh criticism it has received.  I recommend it without reservation.
B00005JM02|5.0|I missed this movie in the theaters, and was very anxious to see it.  I LOVE IT!  Good story, diverse assortment of sea life, and very realistic scenery.<BR>I can't really see where there are any parts scary enough to induce nightmares!  A little scary, but nothing out of the ordinary. (Think Bambi, Dumbo, Lion King, etc) My 2 year old niece watches this movie at my house at least twice a week.  Totally captivates her, and it doesn't frighten her at all.<BR>I thought that writer/director Andrew Stanton was perfect as Crush!  The surfer dude turtles were great anyway, and it was neat to find out that he did the main turtle dude's voice.<BR>Who could blame poor Marlin for being so overprotective of Nemo?  It was his decision to move to the drop off, which led to the death of Coral and all of his future children, except Nemo.  And then, when Nemo was born with a \\"lucky fin\\", it probably gave him even more reason to be neurotic.  It shows a lot of love and devotion for Marlin to brave sharks, jellies, whales, etc, when he would much rather be safe and secure in his anemone.  And the look on Nemo's face when Nigel is explaining to Nemo that his dad is looking for him.  He only knows his dad as smothering, and taking some of the fun out of being a kid.  To know that his dad was confronting all of these creatures, and renews Nemo's spirit, and gives him the urge to keep fighting and to not give up!<BR>All children are shocked to learn exactly what their parents will do to keep them safe, and Nemo is no different.<BR>Dory is fabulous, and her whale talk is hysterical.  And one of my husband's life questions was answered... \\"mine, mine, mine\\"<BR>Over all a great movie, and the DVD extras are great too.
B000000WCA|5.0|Yes!, the Girl Power debut album was in fact a very corny independent woman music record, but, this album set the scene for the return of the POP-DANCE EASY listening music to the charts in the USA.  \\"Wannabe\\" their first single and first & only #1 song set the standard for a new era for woman in music who proclaim independence in a funny way, of course Wannabe will stay in poeple's mind as a track that they don't like to admit they used to like it and sina a long with it, the second single \\"Say You'll Be There\\" took the top 10 by storm help by the power infused by Wannabe, but the song stood by it own power.  \\"2 become 1\\" a sex-love song, with trendy delicatessen, confused many by the real meaning of it, song in a sweet touchy vocal way, this song established the girls as a musical force by the end of 1997.  Other tracks mainly pop-dance well crafted and produced were the disco a like \\"Who Do You Think You Are\\", the inspiriational \\"Mama\\", and the soulful \\"Some Kind Of Lover\\", overall the \\"Spice\\" album gave Sporty, Ginger, Crazy, Posh, Baby the great window of fame and even it got them a movie job, figure that out, if this wasn't a hit, what was it?
B0000AQZYM|3.0|This is a cute movie.  But it starts out with such a sad beginning and some pretty scary parts.  Personally, i think it is for older kids.  My twin 6 yr olds and my 3 yr old will not watch it.  it is too scary and sad.  If they could see beyond those scenes, they'd love the movie.  Some of the humor is hard to catch, but when you do, it's hilarious.  I'll watch it again, but my kids aren't interested.  Maybe in another year or two.  Why can't Disney make a film that doesn't have a tragic, scary and horrible scene!!  Every Disney movie for &quot;kids&quot; has a bad part.  Can't they make just a cute, fun and nice movie for kids???

0553573411|4.0|In &quot;Royal Assassin,&quot; Robin Hobb continues the development of Fitz's character as he perseveres through more young man's emotional growth.  Hobb's strengths, the tactile first-person narrative and the fluid realism in Fitz's mental connections with other characters, flourish as Fitz's mind becomes even more intertwined with Prince Verity and a new animal character.  This parallels his emotional development through interactions with the youthful Molly, the exhausted Verity, and the wasting King Shrewd.<br />However, Hobb's consistent weakness, the glacially moving plot, struggles to carry this character development as Fitz languishes in Buckkeep for the first 500+ pages.  The continuing Red-Ship raids provide external pressure on the leaders, but until Neatbay, the actual raids feel distant from the insulated narrative.  Fitz's brief summer as an oarsman reads like a contrived plot detour to allow the narrative to witness a few battles, but the gritty counterattack at Neatbay provides a crucial visual face to the raiding and features key plot points for Fitz and Nighteyes, Burrich, and Kettricken.<br />Against the backdrop of the coastal-inland political tension, the vicious royal intrigue feels like a natural element in this book, unlike the abrupt shift at the end of &quot;Assassin's Apprentice.&quot;  Hobb boldly casts Fitz emotionally adrift, as his three closest mentors, Chade, Burrich, and Verity, all spend long periods of time away from Buck before the conspiracies rush to a climax and Fitz descends into frantic countermoves.  The ending would have been cheesy deus ex machina in the hands of a lesser writer, but hints in the Epilogue and the first pages of &quot;Assassin's Quest&quot; show that to Hobb, it is merely another character choice that has benefits and consequences.<br />Hobb's intensely real depiction of Fitz's character and the growth she steers him through manage to carry &quot;Royal Assassin&quot; on the strength of that developing character alone, without any fast-paced ordinary fantasy plot.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Erykah Badu is simply a very creative artist.  I would buy this album just to have &quot;I Want You.&quot;  The song starts with a heartbeat and builds layers until Badu is singing full tilt and the rythms are pumping full stream.  In fact I wouldn't have gotten it except I got addicted to this song at the music store.  Who's sick of formulaic radio crap?  Badu breaks down the formula and turns out some great tunes, including some more cohesive tracks than #4.  Check it out, Badu is worth a good listen.
6305508550|4.0|that would be great! What a classic line! The movie rocks from the initial traffic jam scence to the red stapler to kicking the printer in the open field. There are a couple of cliches though. But the movie is great overall.

B000089RVR|5.0|I really enjoyed Dido's frist CD and was really excited when her new cd &quot;Life for Rent&quot; came out. It has some truly incredible songs on the album and is great to sit down and work to. The songs sound svery acoustic and help me to relax when working and studying. <BR>White Flag her first single is the best song on the album but there are other potential singles on the album. I can honestly say I don't know all the names of the songs as I always just listen to the CD as a whole. <BR>The second track stoned is my current favourite on the CD, the song sounds a little more upbeat then the other songs on the CD but different which makes it stand out. <BR>Life for rent is an interesting song with sensational lyrics that really make you think, well written and a great song. <BR>Mary's In India wasn't my favourite song when i first listened to the CD but it is growing on me and is a decent song...not my favourtie but still good. <BR>Sand in my shoes is an upbeat catchy song, makes you want to smile when you hear it. <BR>I think they saved one of the best songs for last, see the sun is a beautiful song and although the CD is finished when you hear this song I can't wait to hear it every time i put the CD on. <BR>Then of course there is a surprize...the secret song, good song. I was very excited when i first realized there was a secret song, by no means a bad song very relaxing and nice to listen to. Overall the CD is incredible and great to listen to, i LOVE it! <BR>(Even though I didn't talk about all the songs on the album I still enjoy all of them. I just wanted to highlight the BEST songs on the album and the ones that are really worth listening to)
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|What a load!  These two baldinis need to get jobs laying brick and quit the music biz.  They take themselves way too seriously for their ridiculo musico.  If you're a 13-year old boy you'll like this album.  Anyone with an ounce of education with see through the pretentiousness.  What the hell happened to this band????
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I've listened to the CD before reading any of the reviews here and elsewhere. I have to say I'm quite baffled by some of the negative comments made about Afterglow. This album is unquestionally beautiful containing very well-crafted songs and it's very Sarah. All the songs are very good and there's no filler. My favorite tracks here are World on Fire, Stupid, Trainwreck, Push, Answer, Time, Perfect Girl and Dirty Little Secret.... mmm that's almost all of them. It's definitely better than Surfacing, which was a slow draggy sleep-inducing CD. There are varied moments in Afterglow but overall it's easygoing and low-key.<BR> <BR>One problem with Afterglow is that it doesn't immediately grab you on the first couple of listens. It doesn't have any 'stop-you-in-the-tracks' kind of songs like Possession. People will likely mistake this low-key effect as meaning that it's not good when it's actually just the opposite. Also, what Sarah McLachlan album is digestible on the first listen? When I first listened to Solace and Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, I actually put them away because most of the songs didn't grab me. What a mistake that was! Now both albums sit in my Top 10 collection of &quot;must-have CDs&quot;.<br />Don't judge by the surface of things. Dig deeper into Afterglow and maybe you'll find some gems there that you never believed were there before. Just be warned that it's a slowburn CD that doesn't make an impression on the first listen, but it definitely gets better when you put it on repeat and let the lyrics and music sink into your senses. If there is one aspect of Sarah McLachlan's music that's constant, it is that it has the tendency to creep into your life one way or another and you may end up relating to her music and feel comforted by her, like I am.<br />So don't give up on Afterglow, give it a chance!
B00005JKED|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - it's truly deplorable, totally unbelievable. There's no way on earth the sleeze-ball portrayed by Denzel Washington in this flick could ever become the commander of an elite police unit in a major US city - just no way. And if I were a Hispanic or Black American, I would be totally insulted by the way my people are portrayed in this film. ALL of them appear to be low-life, drug guzzling,  promiscuous whores and thugs. The only character with any morals is, of course, white. How do these so-called \\"film makers\\" sleep at night? What some people will do for money never ceases to amaze me.
B00000254Q|5.0|I KNEW from &quot;Santana III&quot; that the Santana Band always had a little of the funk in 'em but on &quot;Amigos&quot; it all blasts out from<BR>the grooving &quot;Tell Me Are You Tired&quot; and the Stevie Wonder-like<BR>&quot;Let It Shine&quot;.On &quot;Take Me With You&quot; Carlos's guitar blisters<BR>every funky lick while &quot;Dance Sister Dance&quot; is a luscious latin<BR>groove not heard in this form since &quot;Abraxas&quot;.&quot;Gitano&quot; is a rare<BR>and inspired foray intop classic Mexican folk styles and lead<BR>singer Greg Walker adds spice and vitality to the affair.Once you<BR>have the first three albums of Santana THIS is the place to go!
0805066691|5.0|Being an author of my own book, \\"Under the Rose: Poetry of Tragedy, Essence, and Romance,\\" I can tell you in an unreserved fashion that this book is ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS I EVER READ!<br />I read this book 20 years ago and it opened my eyes and shone light upon me. It moved me so much that I had to write a poem called \\"Early American Strife,\\" which is in my book, UtR. I read Wounded Knee 3 times since then.<br />If you love to read tragedy, suspense, and adventure in a novel of fiction, then this book of nonfiction is for you. I do not know the author of Wounded Knee, and I'm not shootin' from the hip; I speak the truth about this book.
0897500482|5.0|Since the late 1970's,  I have studied Mr. Lee's \\"Way of the Intercepting fist.\\"<br />This book is more than the physical aspects of his methods, but it is a philosophy and a way of life.<br />My favorite quote: \\"Knowing is not enough, you must apply; willing is not enough, you must do.\\" -Bruce Lee<br />Please do not hesitate to check out my Poetry book that I published while in the U.S. Navy in 2003; \\"Under the Rose: Poetry of Tragedy, Essence, and Romance\\"
B00005Y7KX|5.0|the music was amazing, the dancing was one of the best I ever seen.  The sing, I don't even have words to describe it.  Probably the best singing I ever heard.  Truly, a work of art!!(I don't even speak Fremch)
B00005JMFO|5.0|For all those reviewers out there who are saying that Love Actually is not that amazing, I challenge them: it was one of the best and most moving, not only Christmas films, but motion pictures that I have ever seen. I left the theater feeling uplifted by some of the stories, yet saddened by some as well, and in my opinion it takes a great film to truly make you want to laugh and cry at the same time. Love Actually did that. It is just a different kind of film than Bridget Jones, Four Weddings, and Notting Hill, but it certainly, in my opinion accomplished it's goal of being a touching, feel good film.<BR>     There are many subplots to the film which are cleverly joined together by the movie's creators. I will try to summarize some of the plots, however, please excuse me if I skip over some just because there are so many. If you do not want to know the subplots even though I am in NO WAY giving away the endings to the movie, just summarizing parts of the story, stop reading at this point.<BR>     Essentially Hugh Grant has just been elected Prime Minister of England, and falls in love with one of his aides, Natalie (played by Martine McCutcheon), however, he is scared to do anything about it because she works for him and he has such a high profile position. His sister, Karen, (marvelously played by Emma Thompson) is trying to comfort her friend Daniel (also brilliantly played by Liam Neeson) whose wife has just died and who is growing increasingly worried about his stepson Sam (played by the young Thomas Sangster who is adorable) who is becoming more and more isolated from him (we learn it's because he is in love with a girl named Joanna from school and he \\"love's her so much it hurts. It's very cute and watching the father-son bonding over love is very touching.) Karen is married to Harry (played by Alan Rickman) who is conflicted about whether or not to cheat on his wife with an attractive and very forward coworker named Mia (played by Heike Makatsch). Harry is also trying to help Sarah (played by Laura Linney) confess her true feelings for Karl (played by Rodrigo Santoro) that she has harbored for two years, however she too has her own problems because her parents are dead and she is trying to care for her mentally ill brother after they both moved to the UK from America so that he could get proper care. Keira Knightly who plays Juliet, and Peter (played by Chiwetel Ejofor) are newlyweds who are friends with Sarah and Mark (played by Andrew Lincoln) who plays Peter's best male friend who has feelings for Juliet secretly and therefore he tries to ignore her, but she eventually finds this out and thus is conflicted between the two men. Colin Firth plays Jamie, another friend of the couple, who walks in on his girlfriend and his brother going at it and so he goes off to Paris to get away for awhile and write (he is a writer) only to fall for his Portuguese housekeeper Aurelia (played by Lucia Moniz). There are also a few comedic random stories like the story of Colin (played by Kris Marshall) who is kind of floating about all the stories (for example he passes the food out at Juliet and Peter's wedding) and can't get a date, so he thinks that by traveling to America women will dig his \\"sexy British accent\\"; the story of Judy (played by Joanna Page) and John (played by Martin Freeman) who fall in love whilst filming a porno; and my personal favorite for what I believe is the highlight of the movie the story of Billy Mack (played brilliantly by Bill Nighy), and aging rocker who wants to have a Christmas number one by rerecording that famous Wet Wet Wet 90's hit \\"Love is All Around\\" (actually, the theme song from Four Weddings). However, he knows his rerecording sucks and he is not at all politically correct and is very funny in many of his comments.<BR>     Everyone finds their way into everyone else's story and it is really interesting to see how they all unfold. Performances from Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy, and Alan Rickman were highlights, however, the entire ensemble was quite brilliant. Keira Knightly looked gorgeous, Colin Firth looked devastatingly handsome, Emma Thompson and Laura Linney gave heartfelt performances, and Hugh Grant was his usual flawless comedic yet touching performance. Rowan Atkinson had a small, yet hysterical role, as a department store worker in Selfridges, and Billy Bob Thornton makes a small cameo as the President of the United States who makes a pass at Natalie and makes Hugh Grant upset.<BR>     This movie was truly brilliant and I highly advise every one of all ages to see it. It's not just a Christmas film, it's not cheesy, it's true to life and wonderful. Hugh Grant's whole speech at the beginning of the film about Love is Actually all you need is so true, and it really sticks with you after you leave the film as well.

B0000DD79B|5.0|When this CD set came out I couldn't wait to get my hot little hands on it. It was worth every penny, and the concert in Seattle was...well, I cried, okay? There. I said it. What a wonderful evening of memories and music! This was one show you wished would go on and on. Their music is timeless and speaks of a time when we were full of hope and innocence. I highly recommend this CD set to anyone who appreciates good music, perfect harmonies and incredible songwriting. Get this CD set... you won't be sorry. And go to the show if you can!
B0000CAQ26|5.0|Try This is a great example of someones ability to move on through their musical ability. I feel that Pink started out in the R&amp;B type industry but her true strength lies here in the more rock/rebel type sounds, I dont really think that pink has a style as such because she is her own style, she is unique. Try This proves That when you listen to the tracks, there are songs like God is a Dj which is very rock/pop, dancing music which i love to the softer side of her voice which we dont often hear when she sings the beautiful Love song.<BR>Great album which I recommend to anyone to give it a try, unless you are already die hard pink fans, then I know of course you will already have it.<BR>Well done Pink, Love it. 10/10
B000066C6Z|4.0|It's remarkable how few people I know seem aware of this great comedy. The jokes fly fast and furious in the mode of Airplane -it's by the same team.
