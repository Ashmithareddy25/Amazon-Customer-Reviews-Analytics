B000FVQLQQ|5.0|We had to watch this movie for a Medical Terminology II class, and write a paper about it. This movie is a great movie that depicts the struggles in the life of a person with schizophrenia. It is a true story of the life of John Forbes Nash. Amazing movie! Highly recommend seeing it.
0609603086|3.0|This was the least interesting, most predictable mystery by Ken Follett I've read to date. Just a really lame story considering several others I've read by him.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app for Pinterest. At times it is definitely 5 star worthy, but occasionally it will get blotchy and some of the settings for your account, i.e. the photo displayed for each pinboard, cannot be changed. Also you can't add a secret pinboard! I will definitely re-review if its changed.
0451219597|4.0|Excellent character development of most characters. Exciting and engaging story line, generally a good page turner. Looking forward to next one!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|THIS is the best, most heartwarming version of this classic Christmas movie. To have it colorized is the icing on the cake! Don't hesitate to purchase it!!!
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|No substance as a sequel and it underwhelms, the connection to the previous Bourne film's events are pointless, solely to justify the use of the Bourne name for marketing purposes. Action set pieces--especially in the final are dull and overlong.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|again another great book by Tom Clancy hope he keeps up the good work with more great books looking for more
B00866H7SS|2.0|I'm not sure how this could have got published - so many elements in the book are similar to 50 shades of grey that it makes you wonder if it could be just coincidence.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the best game on the market everyone get it asap there are so many things on this game that you will like
B00992CF6W|5.0|How do you craft it is still a good app though please help me so with crafting I am  New to the game
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|This game is very fun. Kids will play with the pieces for hours, not necessarily playing the game. I would suggest to not play it with any more than three people, because it takes a long time to set up for each turn- and the pieces are light, thus a little difficult to set up. But overall, it is very entertaining and very similar to the ipod game!
6304698798|5.0|not much i can say , clint eastwood, eli wallach, and lee van cleafs epic western classic was clints best role , in leauge with his classic josey wales, This was a replacement for an old vhs tape i wore out. also this has left out scenes from the original movie that were cool to see..

B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I watched this series before I read this book. I am a fan of both! I love the idea of Dexter. All the characters are amazing to get to know and fall in love with. Thank you Jeff Lindsay for being so creatively genius! And the books are different from the tv. Series but I love both. Its not a bad thing at all!

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Very enjoyable. While the story does shift through time in what seems a disjointed manner, the author provides a connective tissue that helps the reader over look that issue.  This would make a wonderful movie based on how vivid the descriptions are.  I thoroughly enjoyed it from stem to stern.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is interesting, requires note of skills and proceedural thought and keeps the mind active.  It is fun to work with!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|How could I not love this show? It combines history, the English nobility, drama, romance, war, peace - well, I could go on and on and on. I had just finished reading Ken Follett's Fall of Giants and Winter of the World, the perfect backdrop for this series. Despite my best intentions and the impending Christmas holiday, I devoured both tapes in less than a week. Now I'm going cold turkey until the DVD comes out with the third season. Please don't tell me what happens to Bates.
B006RXQBUC|3.0|Long, winding and ultimately boring. Hard to follow, the plot makes no sense, goes nowhere slowly. Great cast and a wonderful period piece, watch for 20 minutes and then turn off.
B00ANT6OK8|4.0|This (slightly) fictionalized dramatization of the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden is often difficult to watch, for a variety of reasons, but that doesn't mean it isn't any good. It's just not your typically polished, glistening Hollywood rendition, and that takes a bit of getting used to. Flubbed lines are left in the final cut, which serves to humanize the cast. Quiet, unsuspecting character moments are unforgettably interrupted by sudden explosions of violence - effectively mimicking (or so I have to imagine) the bloodrush of a real-world terrorist assault. The methods of torture employed in America's hunt for Al-Qaeda's leader are brazenly featured, as are the mixed spoils of their occasional success. The first act points a firehose of information at the audience, leaving them just as overwhelmed and buried by minutiae as the lead. Jessica Chastain is fiery and confident in that role, essential traits for the complicated character she occupies, but the rest of the supporting cast fades into the wallpaper when she's around. The actual onslaught on Bin-Laden's compound, which eats up the last hour of the film, is the smoothest and most accessible scene by a longshot, remaining factual and vividly lifelike while also ratcheting up the pacing and the tension. As a whole, though, the film is well-acted and effective, but often slow and over-inflated. Though it paints just one side of the story, it refrains from drawing any final conclusions and instead leaves the viewer to deal with the validity of America's motives and methods.
0385737955|3.0|This is the most addicting book that I've ever read in my life. The author has perfected the formula for making a book that you can't put down.<br /><br />I loved this book at first. It's set in a dystopian future, where a group of about forty boys have been sent a few miles up to a stage in the air that is surrounded by a giant maze. The boys have been there for two years, and each day, the elite of the group, called Runners, sprint around through the maze looking for patterns and looking for a way out.<br /><br />The maze is super dangerous, and it's inhabited by deadly Grievers, which are half animal, half machine, and who have already killed about ten boys. Also, all of the characters have lost their memory. Thomas is the main character, and even though he doesn't remember much, he knows that he wants to become a Runner.<br /><br />It's the perfect environment for a great story. It asks so many great questions. Who are the people who sent these boys up in the air and designed the maze? What are the boys supposed to accomplish? Where in the world are they? When in the future does this take place? How did the boys get their strange lingo and dialect? What makes Thomas special and unique? What does the rest of the world look like?<br /><br />The book is action packed. It has great good guys, bad guys, conflict, and problems to solve.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />It is way too addictive, and there is too little substance. This reminded me of playing a farming game, like [[ASIN:1118016963 FarmVille]]. Every time I play one of those games, I end up detesting all of the time I spend playing them. I realize that I've spent a bunch of time, learned next to nothing, and have a craving to keep playing, even though my mind isn't very active.<br /><br />That's the same way with this book. It takes a very very long time to find out very much at all, and when you find it out, it's not very informative. It gives you just enough information to pique your curiosity and make you want more, and then you're enmired in yet another conflict that must be resolved right away. Everybody keeps tons of secrets, which heightens this experience, because you find out very piecemeal the information about how everything works. There are conflict after conflict and problem after problem to be resolved. Every chapter ends in a cliffhanger, that propels you forward. Also, things keep getting worse. Here are two quotes from the book. \\"Things just kept getting worse and worse,\\" and \\"For Thomas, things just seemed to be getting worse and worse.\\" Each chapter has a partial resolution, followed by a greater downfall, which I think is part of the addiction formula.<br /><br />I was so frustrated by how addicted I got to this book. I knew that if I didn't do something, I'd spend my next few days doing nothing but reading every other book in the series, and by the end I'd be even more frustrated. To protect myself, I went online and read the entire detailed plot summary for the other three books in the series. Thankfully now I'm now cured, and I have no desire to read the other books in the series.<br /><br />I liked this book, but I hated it as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Incredible dystopian environment. The environment that these boys live in was wonderfully imagined. If they made a book called, \\"The Illustrated World of Maze Runner,\\" I'd buy that book immediately.<br />+Action packed. The action sequences are great.<br />+You will want more and more and more<br />+Great book if you're buying it for someone who doesn't enjoy reading very much, and you're trying to motivate them to read<br />+If you want a blueprint for making an addictive book, then use this book<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Missed an opportunity to explore group dynamics of a bunch of boys, like [[ASIN:0307281701 Lord of the Flies]] did<br />-It turns out that most of the rest of the world outside the maze is zombies. When I realized this, I thought, \\"Oh no, so the rest of the books in this series are going to be zombie books?\\" I really don't like zombies, so I'm not too thrilled for what happens when they get out of the maze.<br />-Doesn't answer very much, and doesn't give enough detail into the world the book created, and not too much detail into the personalities of the characters. Maze Runner forgoes this for action.<br />-Addicting, and not necessarily in a good waye going to be zombie books?\\" I really don't like zombies, so I'm not too thrilled for what happens when they get out of the maze.<br />-Doesn't answer very much, and doesn't give enough detail into the world the book created, and not too much detail into the personalities of the characters. Maze Runner forgoes this for action.<br />-Addicting, and not necessarily in a good way
B002Q4TKAO|5.0|I have to say this is probably one of the best live concerts I have seen. The Killers are a force to be reckoned with. If you are debating wether or not to buy this concert, rest assured that this DVD + CD is a sound choice. The extras are unbelievable with additional footage of different songs in different shows. I haven't seen DVD's like this one before.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|I got the Kindle version but you can't bookmark \\"pages\\" and there's no table of contents. I saw a poem I wanted to tell someone about but it was hard to find again. I had to go back page by page then try to find where I left off again.<br />Either table of contents or bookmarks would make this perfect.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Every moment worth watching. I will be buying all the seasons--one of those shows you can watch over and over. Highly recommend.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Adaptations of Jane Eyre are a dime a dozen.  It seems there is a new version every year!.  This one by far is my favorite.  When I discovered this version, I had just finished reading the book for the second time.  (First time was for an assignment in school.. this time was for fun)  I found this adaptation to truly capture the chemistry and bond between the two main characters, the way none of the others had done.  Excellent adaptation!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I find this game to be fun and challenging.  I hate haviang to quit playing before I've wiped the smirks off their faces.  Each round is a whole new challenge.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Set in Victorian England, in the middle of the industrial revolution.  The social structure of England is about to change.  Young southern bred Margaret Hale is forced to move north with her parents after her father leaves is Vicarage.  It's is \\"like another planet\\" for Margaret though she courageously takes on these changes for the love of her father.  Still... her love for her southern home and her southern training, makes the task difficult.  She struggles to understand the northern ways of the people, especially those of the rough handsome cotton mill master, John Thornton.  Along with the budding romance, there is also a strong message of understanding and friendship.  Check out this amazing movie... then read the book! If you want more... there is a great blog that discusses all things N&S.  westofmilton.com
B004UID2LC|2.0|The screenshots show options that don't exist in my version. There are only 2 categories of videos: popular and recent. There is no way that I've figured out to access the other options, such as Search.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Not a lot of excitement, but it is cute and makes you think. Great game for sitting and waiting. Great for kids too! Thanks for a good silly thinking game. :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great story, but not thrilled with the ending.<br />Really confused whether or not she ended up with the right guy.<br />I was hoping it was all a dream.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I just love the weather app, it helps me in planning my outside activities and this eliminates canceling my plans.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I won't explain the plot because plenty of others to that already. I love the story. The music in the film is so beautiful I purchased some of the songs for my ipod. The way this story is presented in this film really touches my heart.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|fun and imaginative game. very fun and a good waste of time. makes you think, so it's better than a mindless game to waste the time with.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I enjoyed this story because I really didn't know where it would take me, it was a quick read that kept my attention.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|So, so sad when it ended. All three seasons were good but the best is Season One. Kristen Bell rocks.

B004DM0UII|1.0|Title says it all! Hard to use, difficult to search, lots of lame &#34;stations&#34; - don't waste your time with this... use Spotify instead.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This one of the best cable tv series in many years.  It's action & drama packed and the characters are continuing to evolve and develop.  DVR'd the 3rd season and can't wait for the 4th coming in Feb!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a really great read!  The perspective of a teen in the unpopular crowd is one many of us can relate to.
0805028846|5.0|I love this book. Although, it was a little bigger than I expected. It came exactly on the estimated delivery date provided. It is a beautiful book with great artwork and design. Can be slightly confusing to beginners. (For intermediate or expert people) However, it does provide some basic designs. Heavy, Cardstock like cover. Paperback :)
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed all three books and I'm holding my breath for a fourth!  I felt as though I knew Ana and found myself wishing I knew Christian lol.  Great story!

B0085KGHI6|5.0|Muddy Waters and his band are at an artistic peak in this smoke low ceilinged club in Chicago. Awestruck Stones Jagger, Richards and Woods join Muddy on stage, and finally look as if they are playing the music they originally set out to do. Buddy Guy then comes up and blows everyone off. If you want the real deal, this is the beginning and the end of Chicago Blues. WOW
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Kids initally thought it was lame until they started to play it.  Once we got going they didn't want to quit.  Good game that's easy to learn.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Loved the characters and the story.  Shades of Forest Gump no matter what the old man does it seems to work out in his favor.
1451678193|5.0|It took me 4 tries to read this book, but once I got past 1/3 of this book, it took off! Excellent collection of stories.<br />It's pity that ALL major Bradbury's books are only in print format, no e-book versions. Tragically for a writer who was so much focused onto the future to have his books in last century format...
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Not a typical Steven King novel.  Much factual information on the Kennedy assisnation but it got very wordy after the middle of the book.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is a great game the story line is good the graphics are very good.I have played several of the G5 games and this is one if my favorite games would recommend it to my friends.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|This DVD is great!  I really liked the song Hallelujah.  I wish I could download it in mp3.  Bon Jovi has always been a favorite of mine.  Their music has helped me through many of the heart breaks and sad times in my life.  They are my go to band when I need encouragement.  If I could reach them I would say \\"Thank You, you saved my life on more than one occasion through your lyrics.\\"
143911000X|5.0|If you are truly a bro, you must have this book; as for those who are strict bros, I would recommend having this book accessible and ready to reference at all times. If you don't own this book, you are not a true bro.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I only purchased a few episodes to catch up. I am giving the series a chance but I just can't get into it. However, the price per episode was very good, So I rated it accordingly and not just by my dislike for this series.
1401229921|5.0|In general I prefer my comics to be black and white. The reason isn't because I despise color, but that I love the line work which is often obscured by shoddy coloring. This is less of a problem with modern comics, but even today the colorist can get a bit overzealous for my taste with their favorite Photoshop filter (or motion blur - Ugh!). This is personal preference, but I think the finished art loses some of the emotion and energy of the original pencils.<br /><br />Naturally I was delighted with this book, which is a pure representation of Jim Lee's penciling (before inking even!) unmarred by anyone else. The only thing about this which appears \\"finished\\" are the word balloons, which for my money, they should have converted to greyscale so they didn't stand out so much.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this excellent edition is that the quality of the scans are inconsistent. Perhaps I have a bad print of the book, but some pages really pick up every pencil shade while others almost look like a bad photocopy. This may be how the original boards look, I don't know.<br /><br />But I must say I am very impressed that they took a chance and published a comic like this, I hope there will be more. I love it. A distinctive addition to my collection.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Purchased the game as a Christmas gift. It was a steal for the price and the movie is just excellent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book will hit every emotion you have. You will laugh, you will cry, you will get angry,& sad & hopefull. It will put you through the gamit but you will not quit reading. I do not read parts of books out loud to my husband but here were a number of things I read or told him about because I had to talk about this book.<br />There is a girl who is adopted and knows her father gave her up. There is a young man who is wise beyond his years in how he deals with life and the girl. He is the so called bad boy and she has a reputation for being a slut but you will find out if these labels are true or not. She will be torn apart and put back together again but so is he. It is a book of promise & promises, of like, live and love. There are so many ideas to be quoted like how long a marriage lasts. Are first important or are forevers more important.<br />Hopeless has ended up being on my list of must reads and I will tell all I know that they too  must read it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|You probably won't understand if you don't read the first and second book. It's a great read. I totally re

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I would rate this a five but there are two major issues.  I was level 108 when my Kindle had to be replaced and I had to start all over again.  I also agree that the energy is too slow to refill.  Also at higher levels you should get at least one energy per level.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Dying to Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing<br /><br />I found this book inspiring and enjoyable to read.  Reinforces the thought that worry and fear are so detrimental to our well being.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am a cancer patient.  This made my mind think kind of OUT OF THE BOX. Really enjoyed the read.
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|This book was a good read. It kept me eager at the beginning and at the end. I did, however, feel the middle part was too drawn out. I was a bit bored at that part.
B007L6VR12|2.0|Found it rather boring.  Kids spoken word was a little garbled and low. Very strange content and characters, not my style.
B00975L81Y|3.0|I am 44 years old, and have been a fan of COF for many years. I have all of their albums. While the album is not bad at all, it sounds a bit incomplete. That is, it sounds to me that the songs could have used a bit more work - a bit more time developing them to their full potential. It almost sounds like a \\"rush\\" job in the studio. I miss the vocals we hear in Damnation and a Day or in Midian. Nevertheless, I will continue to support the band because I believe they can do better.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|Used to, when you bought cd you'd get music sheet with it. I wanted the words on only time because I love it. Was really dissapointed. Can someone send me words for it?<br />  Thank u
B008Z9L94O|5.0|One of the very best albums of all time finally on vinyl at a price you can afford to pay!
030758836X|1.0|The ending was so incredibly dumb. I could not believe it ended where it did. I actually thought there was something wrong with my kindle and that the last chapters were missing. Don't read this book. It will leave you feeling angry that you wasted so much time to reach an ending that wasn't there.
0765325950|1.0|Brandon Sanderson is an amazing writer and I can't wait to finish this series. But no ebook in order to juice your hardcover sales to #1 and kill a bunch of trees? So dumb for your loyal fans. I would have gladly paid the hardcover price for the ebook (on the release day). Now hurry up and release Stormlight 2 on ebook so I can give that 5 stars.

B009LL4LMM|3.0|Your child will need to be able to decide how to draw a line that will angle the fall of a jellyfish to bounce off of.  So this is not the best game for say, my four year old.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|Just wanted to keep the season's going.  My kids love this show and I am trying to keep up with them and catch up to the current season.  Great buy!
0765325950|1.0|I have read a lot of the reviews before deciding to post this.  What I can not understand is how releasing this on the kindle and other E-readers would ruin Robert Jordan's legacy.  His legacy of being a long winded writer was set in stone over 10 years ago.  I personally hope he doesn't make the bestsellers list after this.  It's not like he is gonna be writing another book.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I knew this would be a great buy once I bought it.  I have 2 teenage girls who are addicted to this show.  There is no going wrong with having a whole season....Plus I have onle watched a couple episodes, so this will allow me to catch up and see what all the hype is about.
B00280LYIC|5.0|When the movie was made they killed any chance of this book becoming a series of movies. What a shame those involved decided to trash this book and create a movie that doesn't do the book or Rick Riordan' s creativity justice.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This movie...series has always beena  favorite for my husband and myself.  My husband is a veteran after 24 years in the Navy.  He loves these types of movies.  We decied to get the set for my Dad.  Haven't heard back since Christmas if he has started watching them.  I know for myself and my husband its a great set to keep and pass on to the kids.  Well made movie.  Also, this was one of those Awesome deals that Amazon had.  I got it for a great price considering it was Blu-ray.

B00AEFY552|5.0|Gave this 5 star if it is truly a marked advance over older blu ray release of this fantastic movie.<br />Picture of prior blu ray release was compromised by horrendous picture quality for blu ray.  Hopefully this is corrected to warrant re-purchase.  Also, the extended edition is 177 minutes.  If this blu ray release is not 177 minutes then best to continue to buy DVD copy for added footage.  Hopefully we don't need to wait another few years for both improved picture quality as well as 177 min. duration.
0765325950|1.0|at this point it's not worth reading.  Entire series is bloated.  If feels like the system is tweaked to falsely promote some BS - ehhh harriet?
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I have never read the comics, but I am aware of their legacy, so to speak. So when I found out about the film, I was definitely intrigued to watch it. This film was pure adventure from start  to finish, the characters are great, and the amazing animation was a feast for the eyes. This is definitely a film that can be enjoyable for both adults and children alike (though there is a bit of violent action). Loved it and would now like to check out the comics as well!
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|Awesome! Gold (as is everything Rush touches).  Cool idea. Very nostalgic.  Hearing it again stirred up a lot of fond memories.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|it' s o.k.  I really hate the fact that the actual app  never lets me sign out until like after 10 minutes of trying.  everytime I tap a different button, it goes to something totally different.  If I hit the friends key it goes to something else.  totally ticking me off after about 10 min.  I thought it might be the kindle but it seems to only be happening when I am on fb.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is the second book in the series and I can't wait to read the third when it comes out!
B0071LLHGC|5.0|This is a fantastic recording of the original line up of The Allman Brothers in their prime yet the American audience was just starting to discover them. This recording sounds so fresh with different renditions of song that we all know so well. It is great to hear these slightly different takes on the songs. It's mostly the solos that are different. Greg's voice sounds very clear, someone that I've always considered to be the greatest white blues singer (auguably). It's interesting to hear Greg play electric piano on some of the songs. The recording is also very clear and balanced with true stereo separation (Duane's on the left and Dickie's on the right, just like they used to play live). Elmore James and Muddy Waters would be proud of the covers of their songs here ( I didn't mention the other three deceased blues men whose songs they also cover, because I really don't know). I highly recommend this cd for fans of the late Duane Allman and the original line up of The Allman Brothers.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book. have already read the second book and can't wait until the 3rd comes out. She is a great author and can't wait to read more from her.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show with its amazing actors, intense storyline and memorable moments. I have cable, but not AMC, so the show being available on Amazon instant video is great.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie wasn't bad. It has some funny scenes but I don't think it was as good as it was built up to be. Not bad...the ending was really predictable.
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over and never tire of it mainly because of the<br />historical element that is the main theme of the movie involved with Queen Victoria,<br />Darwin and evolution and the extinction of the Dodo bird.  It would be a fun way for<br />children to learn about important people and personalities of the 19th century.  It comes highly recommended by myself although I realize that there are people who may not care for the inclusion of the ideas of Darwin.  My suggestion would be to preview it if there are any doubts about the historical elements included.  Overall my son and I loved it!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow!  Great finish to a great series.  Not all happiness and sunshine but beautiful just the same.  I loved all three books. Hope the rest of the movies do them justice.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I found the story line to be amazing.  Not to mention the special effects looked wonderful.  The antagonist made the movie come more alive.
B009M4KTTC|5.0|Every LP he puts out is better than the last one. Kid Rock is #1 rock artist right now and has a great band as well.<br />Loves the USA, Supports the troops, does anything he can to help the people of Detroit. What more can you ask? Nice job!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The songs that were chosen were great and I must admit that I was singing along.  After this movie, I became a HUGE Rebel Wilson fan!  The cast was really good.
1424821029|5.0|Movie arrived on time, in perfect condition. The blu ray version of this movie is well ahead of the DVD version, I own, also the VHS tape.  It's high resolution, bright and clear detail makes watching it that much more pleasurable. It's futuristic theme, plays well with the new high definition look, it gives it that much more realism. I would recommend this site to others.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|Not your usual &#34;Christmas album.&#34;  Has a quasi-medieval, -Celtic, -Mediterranean flavor, a little dark at times.  It is entirely acoustic.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I tried to play these DVDs on two DVD players, SONY and SANYO(they were not cheap players) and my new DELL laptop.  Had the same problem on each.  The THIRD DISC of each season had a problem.  Some seasons the THIRD DISC had 2-3 episodes that would break up and one THIRD DISC would not play at all.  Why did the first and second disc of each season play beautifully without any problems at all?  I have NEVER experienced any problems on my players before.  If the manufacturer is aware of the problem, why not list the players that it will not have problems!!!  Why offer these for sale this way?  Why can they not manufacture them without the problems????  Very disappointed with this, I was looking forward to watching this wonderful series in entirety.  Too bad the other collection is also made by the same manufacturer.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I would recommend this cover. It's not as heavy as I would have liked, and he elastic doesn't seem particularly strong, but it's great for gentle use around the house. I'd recommend.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Bought this for 9 year old grandson for Christmas.  He was impressed and challenged.  The fun thing was to see how all the adults picked it up and tried it.  Might be a good item for office waiting rooms.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  100% recommend to anyone.  It's historical fiction, but you don't have to love the genre to love this book.  The characters are intriguing and it's enough diversity to keep you interested, but not too much that you forget who the characters are.
B007WFQZHS|5.0|The first impression i had is... the perfect combination of the Heaviest Parts of Thrash Metal with a nice melodic approach... The result... PERFECT !!!! I highly Recommend this ... and you have the Bonus DVD with a nice Live Footage at the Wacken..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Getting even with the system that is on occasion flawed and or has a few bad apples in it is what the main character accomplished.  I dont understand why Grisham made the character black though.

B000002KHB|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time, apart from Deep Purple in rock, one of the best rock bands in the world.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|fabulous script writers make art, or rather meaningful TV fare, out of crime, the economy, corporate maneuvering, and edgy intimacy. The outstanding cinematography and ensemble acting have turned these great scripts into an epic with a precise economy: everyone is held accountable for their sins, great and small, and paybacks are excruciatingly interesting. It's probably the only show that could have withstood its perilous Sunday night schedule.
B000025Y9I|4.0|Is a great album , but I thought that part one &#34;the road to hell &#34; was intrumental. but is a great singer and song writer

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book kicks ass. This is the best series of novels I've ever read! I strongly recommend it to any one.
0765325950|1.0|Chalk this up as another point against the distribution, rather than the actual content. No matter how good a book is, if I can't read it, it's worthless. Looks like Jordan's legacy will turn out to be one star - good job, Harriet.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|At first I was put off by the violence, but came to realize this movie is probably the best commentary on the 1980's era and the attitudes of the 1%ers since then. Bale's performance is stellar as he embodies the benumbed mindset of the Masters of the Universe that Tom Wolfe wrote about in \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\". The Bateman attitude towards others continues to this day by those in power and those that stand in the shadows behind them.  Bateman's violent rampage, his crack up and recovery when he realizes nothing will happen to him and he won't be punished is Vulture Cannibalistic Capitalism writ large. This movie is not for the faint of heart or squeamish, but it is an unflinching look at our values as a country and culture, and where we'd rather not look.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app can do so much more than other noise apps can. I really like that I can combine different sounds together at different intensities... or use a pre-set combination. Great and well worth the price of zero dollars!

B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is right in my wheel house and I like it. A few suggestions to the developers: 1) give us the option to turn  off the music! 2) move the pause button, I constantly hit it accidentally 3) keep track of my previous times, not just the fastest...I want to see how my time fits with my history!
B005LAIHCW|3.0|I liked this movie but I had problems with it. Pros Jennifer Lawrence is awesome , it made me jump , and the screw with your mind ending. Cons Horrible first half , Predictable at times , and the acting other than Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue. I wanted to like this more but it wasn't perfect.

B002ZBRSMK|5.0|Myths and beliefs about the fall of man are older than civilization. This a modern take on the fall of man although Bowie's character is an alien who both literally and symbolically falls to earth. I love the abstract way the film makers added ideas and concepts to the story.
B0086213XW|1.0|I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done.  The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go.  Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story's thesis---what was the writer's argument about life?  The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.<br /><br />I was bored throughout.  I got tired of staring at the main character's depressed and confused facial expressions.<br /><br />The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness.  Worst of all, I did not respect her.  Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf.  Who was she?  Where was her determination and sense of purpose?  And, finally, as far as the plot conclusion goes, where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose?
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I loved that this book was set in Ireland.  I enjoyed the characters very much.  Three stories go on that eventually weave together.  I found one of them quite dark.  I don't have a problem with dark, but this seemed to go on much longer than it needed to in each section, grim detail  by grim detail.  The other parts of the book are charming and often funny and very entertaining.  The contrast and transitions were somewhat jolting.  I think it is worth a read, nonetheless.
0316077046|5.0|I absolutely loved the book Beautiful Creatures, and the second book in the series is no exception.  Lena suffers greatly over her uncle's death and Ethan does his best to help her.  Margaret Stohl and Kami Garcia have taken a sequel and kept the reader's attention, while weaving the story line in a unique and interesting way.  I have to say that I purchase the remaining 3 books and this book was so interesting that I will immediately go into the third book.  Great series!

Normally his books receive better than a 3 rating from me, but I found I had a hard time getting through this one.  Although the story was entertaining, I didn't feel like the book was well written.  The story line was predictable and not his usual suspenseful read.  I will say that even if this book wasn't a great read, I still look forward to his next one!

B004TPXVKS|5.0|Three was a charm for Caravan, and I'm sure this 1971 recording cemented their place in the hearts of many a fan, making the recordings done both before and after more desirable. And over 40 years later it's still a great listen!<br /><br />Other reviewers here have done a great job of detailing the contents (and the Wikipedia article on the band is fantastic for getting a picture of their various line-ups), so I'll just keep this simple and say I love the original album (available as the 1989 import [[ASIN:B000006XFQ Land of Grey & Pink]], which in some ways is the best place to start (just the album as it was originally presented). In 2005 another version was released ([[ASIN:B00005A0V0 In the Land of Grey & Pink]]) which includes several nice bonus tracks (the instrumental/hummed vocal Winter's Wine and early demo of Golf Girl are fun, entertaining and educational). Then in 2011 this 40th anniversary edition came out, which includes what was on the '05 edition plus much more.<br /><br />As mentioned by another reviewer the biggest negative of this whole release is the fine cover art being obscured by a promo sticker (the full cover does show on the DVD screen however). The pluses are abundant - 3 discs of music (Disc 1 - original album mix plus 3 tracks of unreleased and/or alternate versions, Disc 2 - 6 tracks of related material from the 12/1970 recording session and 5 tracks from various live performances, Disc 3 - 5.1 mix by Steve Wilson including the additional track Frozen Rose in the body of the complete album (probably cut due to original Lp constraints), plus a \\"new stereo mix\\" of the whole original album, plus the really excellent bonus of actually seeing Caravan play Golf Girl and Winter Wine from a '71 TV session.), as well as 19 page booklet with photos, essay and recording details. Deluxe indeed!<br /><br />The sound quality is great throughout, especially the 5.1 mix.<br /><br />Musically this has always been the most satisfying Caravan recording for me, the band seeming to be really competent individually and comfortable with each other, with the style loose and whimsical and the content sweet and innocent (the best of hippie sentiments) - Golf Girl makes a great opener, Winter Wine has some of the prettiest music they ever recorded, Love to Love You is light and playful, the title track is magical, and the second side's opus Nine Feet Underground is fantastic - grooving and jamming Caravan at their best. It has taken me years to come to accept that David Sinclair's keyboards are making most of the lead sounds. Somehow I thought there had to be more of Pye Hasting's electric guitar in there, mirroring and exchanging leads with Sinclair. But it really seems this a 23 minute display of Sinclair's virtuosity, and the incredible sympatico of the whole group. Another notable aspect is the abundant and tasteful flute, tenor sax and piccolo parts contributed by longtime guest Jimmie Hastings.<br /><br />If you are new to Caravan I'd just recommend the earlier (cheaper) original version, but if you are a fan then this deluxe  edition is the one to get.or me, the band seeming to be really competent individually and comfortable with each other, with the style loose and whimsical and the content sweet and innocent (the best of hippie sentiments) - Golf Girl makes a great opener, Winter Wine has some of the prettiest music they ever recorded, Love to Love You is light and playful, the title track is magical, and the second side's opus Nine Feet Underground is fantastic - grooving and jamming Caravan at their best.

B0012GMW0C|4.0|It seems like many people are not familiar with the pre-Steve Perry version of Journey, but the band did 3 albums prior to Perry joining up and this first one may be the best of the bunch.  The band was formed from the remnants of the original Santana band with Greg Rollie and Neal Schon joining forces once again to launch Journey in 1975.  The majority of this album leans towards progressive rock which is quite different from the more pop / rock direction they would take later on.  The album features some incredible instrumental workouts as well as a few more pop oriented tunes.  It has always been a mystery to me why this version of the band never really took off commercially, especially with the pedigree of it's members.  Although Greg Rollie was not in the same league as Steve Perry in the vocal department, he still has a decent vox and had been the voice behind some of Santana's biggest hits.  Schon was already a brilliant guitarist by this point and drummer Ansley Dunbar would go on to play with a multitude of well known bands, once his tenure with Journey was complete.  Anyway, if you are looking for a side of Journey you may have never been exposed to, this album is a great place to start.

B007FXLZ9K|5.0|Directed by Steve McQueen, \\"Shame\\" explores sexual addiction, alienation, and loneliness in contemporary New York City. With its many sex scenes, the film manages to be unerotic. The movie and its actors have received numerous accolades. The acting is convincing and the scenes of city life well drawn. Many viewers will find this film disturbing.<br /><br />The film stars Michael Fassbender as a successful 30ish professional named Brandon who cannot control his sexual appetites or channel his sexuality into a relationship. Brandon is both a predator and a victim. He is apparently able to pick up attractive similarly lonely women on the spot for short encounters. Brandon also uses the services of prostitutes. When he is home alone, he watches pornography and camgirls on his computer. He gets confronted with a wide range of pornographic material on his office computer. He is unable to function in an attempted relationship with a coworker, Marianne, (Nichole Beharie) which involves attempted emotion beyond sex. Fassbender plays this role well in his lines, dress, gestures, and facial expressions. He has a sense of decency and is at war with himself.<br /><br />The other primary character in \\"Shame\\" is Brandon's younger sister Sissie played by Carrie Mulligan. Sissie has suicidal tendencies and is emotionally needy. She moves in with Brandon early in the film and the emotional tension mounts between the siblings as the movie progresses. Each sees the serious, devastating issues in the life of the other. Brandon's sexual addition and his relationship with Sissie become intertwined and form the two themes of this movie.<br /><br />The movie makes have use of atmosphere to establish the sordid character of Brandon's mind. There are many scenes of crowded subways which capture the lonely, solitary character of much urban life. There are pick-up scenes in bars, from the fancy to the seedy, which stress lack of emotional connection. The movie shows several scenes of paid sex between Brandon and various women together with the shame and sadness felt by both parties. The musical score is ominous and brooding, punctuated by Glenn Gould playing Bach and by various pop songs. Sissie is trying to make it as a singer and, in a pivotal scene of the movie, offers a rendition of \\"New York New York\\" in the company of Brandon and his boss.<br /><br />The movie includes substantial nudity, male and female. To their credit, the producers declined to soften the movie to receive an \\"R\\" rather than a \\"NC-17\\" rating. The movie offers an effective portrayal of how sex can become a narcotic to deal with loneliness in a harsh world.<br /><br />Note;  This review originally posted on Amazon on December 26, 2011, but was inexplicably deleted.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanetween Brandon and various women together with the shame and sadness felt by both parties.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a book I admire but not enjoyable to read because of the tough subject matter. Worth reading for what you learn. I hope it will help other Americans appreciate how precious is our freedom. The fact that millions of people still live in countries that are oppressive, torturing, totalitarian regimes where a human life means nothing and propaganda is rampant  is something we can't believe is possible. It is........

B008FYZIVY|5.0|The stories are addictive.  After each viewing, we can't wait to watch the next one to see what develops and how all the lives play out. The dialogue is sharp and witty, especially Maggie Smith's character.  There's always so much happening downstairs, but as much upstairs as well.  An especially enjoyable show to watch.

B004MKLRQA|4.0|I was to read this for a reading class I had in community college. It was a good read, but a bit hard to get into at first. It did feel like he was writing this for sympathy which is what I did not like about it. I felt like I was being forced to feel bad for him in the story. I still gave it 4 because the story and what he went through is great, but I feel like it could have been better written.

B007MDK4XQ|3.0|Sadly, this book is very short. It is a good read, but almost not long enough to be published as a book in my opinion.
1451695195|3.0|My husband said it was ok. I have started to read it and it sure leaves out Jesus in the NDE. It is interesting from a medical (Dr) viewpoint.
B007FXLWKW|4.0|great holiday movie that is new and not a rip off of a claymation, original story, good soundtrack, lovable characters
B0057LUI0O|5.0|My kids and I love this movie. My daughter's favorite character was Jewel. The movie is very clever and engaging.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I have really enjoyed this season. I love the variety of characters and the plot lines.  I think that this is worth the watch.
B001FA0NZ6|3.0|Any make up tutorial in YouTube does a better job in covering make up techniques. I read the whole book in less than 2 hours and I didn't learn anything really different.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Here are the Dickens classics, which you may have read in school or later, and may have seen in their film versions.<br /><br />The writing style is a bit dated, but they are well written and give a viewpoint from the 1800s, when they were first published, most of them  in monthly or weekly installments.<br /><br />Several of them I'd heard of but never read, as it was difficult to find them
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Fantastic. Great entertainment. Very well put together. The three girls played their parts well, and Meryl Streep was outstanding. Very good.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|One of the authorities of how to write well. As both a writer and editor for other writers, I use this a lot in trying to improve my writing and that of the authors I am helping.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|This CD was not as good as her other ones. I was very disappointed as she seemed to be trying to modernise her style of entertainment.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Order arrived very quickly and was exactly what I was expecting. Very cheap for the amout of product. Well worth it. A great buy.
B00280LYHS|5.0|A great book for children who like magic,fairytales,or fiction in general an amazing book worthy of the 5 stars I gave it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game has always been a favorite for me. I can take it where I go and pass the time if I need to.
B006VRDZ44|3.0|I viewed only the first episode of this series.  It was just okay.  I'll probably watch it again before deciding if I want to buy the whole first season.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|From Twilight Sparkle and her friends to obscure characters that only the most dedicated pony fan will recognize, fans of the series will enjoy seeing their favorite characters rendered in surprisingly high quality graphics. The ponies walk around a Ponyville of your own construction and perform a series of pre-rendered and cycling animations. It's cute at first, but glaringly artificial after awhile. The game would be well-served by increasing the number of animations each pony cycles through and perhaps even adding individualized animations. While the main story ponies, Twilight Sparkle and her friends, all have a single personalized animation (Pinkie Pie pounces a cupcake, Rarity looks at herself in a mirror, etc), it is hardly enough to distract from the repetition of it all, and the rest of the ponies are character-less automatons who all act the same. It would be nice if the Cutie Mark Crusaders recognized each other and traveled together or if Twilight and her friends reacted to one another. Even adding personalized animations for ALL the ponies, rather than just the \\"important ones,\\" would help the ponies feel like more than just the same character with a different skin. But overall, while these flaws are noticeable, the animations are fluid and clean and do a lot to add to the life of the game, particularly compared to the static and unliving worlds of Farmville and its ilk. It is nice that much of the cast of the show is included and those who are up on their pony lore will squee to see not only the main characters, but also secondary like Apple Bloom and the Cutie Mark Crusaders, Trixie, and Spitfire...as well as background characters that only the most die-hard fans will recognize, like Time Turner and Octavia.<br /><br />Pony fans may also enjoy the rehashing of the first story arc of the popular television show. Nightmare Moon has bathed Ponyville in eternal night out of jealousy of her sister (who rules the day) and it is up to Twilight Sparkle to rebuild Ponyville to create a place for her friends to escape the darkness. It's a clever take on the popular city-building mechanic many apps have adopted. In practice, you will spend your time (and hard-earned cash) split between constructing shops and buying pony characters from the show. The lure of buying your favorite character is strong, but unfortunately the exorbitant cost of these ponies between three different types of currency (in-game currency earned through shops and when you level, crystals that you buy with real cash, and \\"hearts\\" which you get from in-game friends) will force you to decide whether you want to save for Fluttershy or actually build that mane salon you've been oggling. You can employ up to three ponies in each shop, choosing to produce one of two items--the first one the quicker-producing of the two--with the third pony giving both items a cash boost. This is where the more conventional aspects of this sort of game come into play and folks who are familiar with the genre will be able to tell what comes next: if you're bored and able to sit and constantly tend to your own little Ponyville it is more time/money efficient to make the quick-producing items while if you succumb to the frail human failing to sleep, you will want to set your ponies to produce the more time-intensive ones. Unfortunately, this turns the game (and others of its ilk) into a math equation and, as always, the game loses any sense of customizability or personalization as you are forced to figure out the most efficient way to gain money to buy what you need/want rather than building some kind of story to go along with your artificial world (\\"Today, Twilight Sparkle worked in the book shop with Pinkie Pie and Rarity. Hilarity ensued\\").<br /><br />Cash is also hard to come by, particularly at first, and you'll find yourself either waiting for quite awhile to buy the pony/shop you want, or tending closely to your game for many hours. The pay currency is expensive, but comparable to other games of the genre. Expect to spend money on this game, particularly if you want to proceed with the story (you will find yourself literally and completely stuck in the story if you go into this game determined not to spend a dime). Two of Twilight's friends (Rarity and Rainbow Dash) require you to actually buy crystals from the store, as do a number of characters from the show (noteably Rarity's sister, Sweetie Bell, the Wonder Bolts' Soarin', Twilight's brother Shining Armor and his wife Cadance, and the extremely expensive Princess Celestia).<br /><br />Even more troubling is the star system, which is like a leveling system for your ponies. You will wait a set period of time (which is shorter for the first ponies you \\"recruit\\" and goes up in time from there) and play one of two mini-games with the pony, either bouncing a ball between your finger and the pony or catching apples as they fall from the trees. After gaining a certain number of points in these games, you will play one final mini-game--a side-scroller in which you fly and gather coins and clouds to \\"clear the sky\\"--and get your pony their star. However, the stars themselves do very little. Each shop slot requires a pony with a certain star level, but other than that, you have no incentive to increase your ponies' star ratings. A five-star pony in a low-level shop will not increase its production value or decrease production time, so in the end, it's essentially a waste of time beyond a certain point. The mini games themselves are moderately enjoyable at first, but eventually become an extremely tedious chore. The ball-bouncing game in particular seems finicky until you get the hang of it. And even after that point, it has long lost its charm, along with its apple-catching cousin. The game would be vastly improved by a variety of mini-games that you could choose from in order to break up the monotony.<br /><br />In the end, despite the game's flaws, My Little Pony is a fairly enjoyable entry to the genre, if only because of its aesthetic appeal--it's enjoyable to watch the ponies wander around and simulate life, even if they use the same stock of animations over and over again. Like all apps, I anticipate that it will grow over time, though (also like all apps) the Kindle Fire version of My Little Pony is and always will be light years behind its iOS and Android cousins. If you are a fan of the show, do yourself a favor and give this game a try for despite all of my criticisms, it behooves me to admit that I have played this game pretty much nonstop for a couple of days now.<br /><br />...get it? BeHOOVES? I am so hilarious.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fascinating book, enjoyable and engrossing.  Provocative story line with interesting, realistic and engaging characters.  One of Stephen King's best, and that's saying a lot!
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I listened to the audiobook from audible.com but it still was an excellent book.  It is about two sisters; one sick and one healthy.  That is it about the story.  I will not say anymore.  I listened to this book in two days.  I had to find out how it ended.  The ending will shock you.<br /><br />I have found a new author to follow in Jodi Picoult.  I like the way she writes and tells a story.  She gives her characters a past.
0761163808|3.0|The moving images are clever and impressive.  The text is misleading.  Whoever wrote the text has never been to Africa and stayed out in the bush for a cuple of weeks.  The underlying tone of &#34;environmentalism&#34;, which  basically is anti-hunting, is inappropriate.  Several countrie are banning sport hunting and the poachers soon will decimate the wildlife, including someof the animals featured in this book.  it has happened before, in kenya and inZambia, and it is about to happen again in Botswana and Zambia.<br /><br />The photos, with only brief text, would have been a fun book for kids.  too bad it didn't turn out that way.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|When I first listened to this cd I thought \\"wow so much rapping\\". The second time around I whipped out the lyrics and started to familiarize myself with their songs, and I truly enjoyed it. This cd is the best I have heard in a long time. Six Degrees of Separation starts off slow but is extremely catchy and is my favorite song on the disc. Closely following is If You Could See Me Now, which actually had me in tears when I finally listened to the meaning. The Good Old Days is such a feel good song you'll be happy it's the first on the disc. I have seen this band in concert and they never cease to amaze me. What a great cd! You will not be disappointed.
B0089ZZXX2|5.0|There was no issues with ordering and the package arrived within a few days! Very satisfied with my order! Thanks!
B003XQ9BXU|5.0|Pretty much fact about King Richard the way he died on the way home from the Crusades looting castles to regain wealth.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I love the versatility of this app. The UI is incredibly user friendly and smooth. Visually appealing due to it's simplicity. Would be perfect if it buffered the music a few minutes in advance so I wouldn't constantly deal with it's beeping and pre/rebufferring all the time. Otherwise fantastic product I've recommended to many friends.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The second one is better than the first one actually lots of corny one liners and tongue in cheek humor with a lot of explosions and gun battles so something for every one :-)
B0093COK4S|5.0|The sound is a return to her breakout mid-80s synthpop solo records, including the return of Hubert KaH on backing counterpoint male vocals...like Kylie Minogue's 2000 back-to-pop comeback &#34;Light Years&#34;, and with a more mature angle, like Kylie...Sandra's sorta-comeback comes at age 50 and her 10th solo album.  I found her last 2 albums enjoyable...the darker, painfully personal, artful &#34;Art Of Love&#34; from 2007 (she wrote all the lyrics on that one), and 2009's strange American R&B/Latin (??) flavoured &#34;Back To Life&#34;...many people thought her career was dead in the water...but the German DJ/remix/production duo Blank & Jones decided to step in (intervention??) and fix her career...first with the AWESOME 2CD &#34;So80s&#34; compilation that takes her 80s 12&#34; singles and keeps them in one place...then the new album...as much as I love her 2000's work, this thing is her best album since &#34;Close To Seven&#34; from 20 years ago...(?!?!)...scary.  She did not write any of the songs though...producer/collaborator/one-time Cretu side-guy Jens Gad did 90% of them...but that's fine because it's one vision (not a hodgepodge of outside people), and like she's the singer in the Jens Gad/Hubert KaH Band...sounds like the logical next step after 1988's &#34;Into A Secret Land&#34;, as if Enigma and &#34;Paintings In Yellow&#34; never happened, a blip in time skipped...
B008JAGZDE|1.0|Some people just never grow up and this was a perfect example was hoping it would have at least 1 redeeming quality but Nope not at all
B006RUJST6|5.0|It made me laugh & cry. Well written. Each character was someone you could relate to. Can't wait to read the second book.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Great movie as they all have been just good clean fun for the whole family you can't go wrong with this one
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling definitely made the transition from young adult to adult.  Lots of characters with their own involved stories to tell.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|To predictable no surprises and a lot of bitchy women blah blah blah just not worth the rental price really
0062206281|4.0|BOUGHT IT AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY COUSIN. SHE LOVES THE AUTHOR. LOVES THE BOOK, CAN READ IN BOTH SPANISH & ENGLISH.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Was worth the watch for the special effects alone Iam not a Tom Cruise Fan but the movie was good enough to keep my interest at least
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This may be good for Skype, but it certainly isn't any good for taking any pictures other than yourself!  I find this very annoying.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book was a fun and easy read! Defiantly would read another one of her books! Would absolute recommend this book to others!
075669812X|5.0|Purchased for Xmas present for nephew, he won't put the book down.  It was his favorite present....I even trumped Santa.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm a huge Colleen Hoover fan so I was anxiously anticipating this story. 'WOW!' is all I could think to say when I was finished. The book fills you with so many emotions. It had me laughing, it made me cry, it made me swoon & it actually scared me at times. It was extremely intense, the subject matter is not for the faint of heart. It was beautifully written, the characters were absolutely perfect. Colleen Hoover is simply amazing!!! I would highly recommend this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|Love thefact the game changes every turn. Smooth play field. nice graphics. I will never beat this game but still love to play.
B00846REIS|4.0|would have rated it higher if I hadnt been stuck on Christian Grey~ but looking forward to the second book
B007PXZ2RQ|5.0|I love Florence and the Machine! This album is great! The songs are live which makes it even better than the other albums by them that I own.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Case is exactly what we were looking for. The only issue is having to make sure we don't lose the little nut on top but we just upgraded the car to go Bluetooth so this isn't an issue anymore.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|this is a grate battery grip made by canon, its very very well made,a little on the heavy side,but fits the d7 like it was made for it,and it was!!! i was going to try one of the other off brands,glade i did not, some times you get what you pay for! this would be one .grate delivery from amazon too.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My grandson introduced this game to me, and  I love it! It's fun and addictive.  One drawback.....once I start I can't stop.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely loved this series.... recommend to anyone that enjoyes saltry reading. Arousing, intriging, and captivating to say the least.  FANTASTIC!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Needs a little more detail in the end but, a very good read. Would recommend to everyone. Couldn't put it down.
B005LAII80|1.0|This is the second disc of this movie that is defective. Amazon was very fast replacing the first one, but the second has the same problems.  The movie freezes and the sound drops out and pops after the 38 minute mark intermittently throughout the movie.  This is obviously a bad production run of the blu ray disk.
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I really love the sound of this album. It does sound different then some his previous work, but I would say that it is a good direction. It has more of the sound of the bee-gees and disco influence. I would say that I really enjoy it.
1451695195|3.0|good book a little technical. I think he is a bit of a narcisist. I think his accounts are real.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Good  game which you can even play if you lose internet  My kids like this game collecting money and chasing down animal s
B005LAIH3G|5.0|It's hard finding a movie that's great for kids and adults. John Carter is one of those movies. Sundays is our movie night. Usually we pack up our 8 year old and try and decide on something that is kid appropriate. We chose John Carter and loaded up on popcorn, soda and junk food. When we sat down my girlfriend and I prepared to zone out the way we usually do during kids movies. We found ourselves enjoying it as much as our kid. By the time it was over that's all we could talk about. I had to download the books on my kindle and we are patiently waiting for the sequel. This was a movie with a little something for everybody! Defiantly one of those movies that wasn't credited enough. It's a must see!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|My favorite movie!!! I watch it every year at Christmas.  It has become a tradition and we love all the characters.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|The kids love it and I have to say it is very addictive! I could play for hours and not be tired!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book bought as a gift as were books one and two. My wifeseemed to enjoy all three books since she read non stop through the three. I am not sure I'm old enough to read these books!!! Seriously, judging from her interest I would recommend all three,
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like it especially the big picture but sometimes it freezes and I have to restart my whole kindle. On the down side, I get Facebook notifications way faster on my phone than on the kindle.
0345803493|5.0|Please see comments on Books one and three all three purchased as gifts for my wife. She seemed to enjoy all three.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is funny and fun like angry birds. rovio done it again with another addicting game. I love this game! :)
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Mediocre movie. Plot is alright but acting is poor. Quality of images is great on HD tv. Overall I recommend if you have nothing better to do that day
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|do not get this it gives you SIX boards in ONE level! there should only be one board in each level!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard of the synopsis of this book, I was pretty much turned off and vowed to never read it.  As months went by, I decided to finally give it a fair shot.<br />I could not have been more pleasantly surprised by this book.  Collins truly takes the reader into the very heart of the Hunger Games.  She eloquently writes about survival in the midst of a harsh, cruel, dictatorial, corrupt government.<br />If you don't prefer page turners, DO NOT READ THIS!  I could not put this book down!
B005HSL626|5.0|this is awesome. I recommend this app to anyone who likes fun games. there's also a puss in boots version!  :) I &lt;3 this app
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this ap is a great time killer. just pop it on and off you go. wish I didn't lose as many prizes as I do though lol.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love playing pac-man at spaghetti warehouse so I got this game so now I can play pac-man whenever I want on my kindle! :) I recommend this to  pac-man fans
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|great story, great graphics. I really liked the underwater effects, and the hidden object games.I would definitely recommend this to those who like this type game. Can't wait for the sequel.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|this app is like farmville because you build a farm and like pokemon because you get a monster and it evolves. so sort of like a pokemon version farmville.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Second book I read by Colleen Hoover. She writes so well I feel like I'm living it. Will read everything she writes. Cried my eyes out. Such a beautiful story.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game its really fun. and the characters sound like the show.  and derpy is in it! best game ever!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|very good surprised at end awesome<br />some silly quotes but understanding relation<br />good read cant wait for movie next month
B007MNV5WU|1.0|so not fair I want this so bad but its not FREE! please make it free. btw I like the ice bird.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Not very good why beat a dead dog to death HMM wonder why they made this film probably for the money im sure but who is counting
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a cute game. I love the little animals! and it has some mini games too like playing catch washing your pet and feeding your pets.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|You can never have enough notebooks, and this one is great. i have a notebook for everything and they are all in the same place. I tried the Pro and it was the same as the free one so i returned it and kept the free one. I am finding that the only differance between the free apps and the purchase apps is the fact that the free ones come with little tiny ads that run across a VERY SMALL portion of the bottom of the screen, but they do not get in the way of whatever you are. in fact I hardly notice them. Thi is a great app for pople of all walks. You can customize it as to book color number of pages and so much more, you even have a choice of script and they are the same choices that you get with the pro.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app and the blue bird is my favorite angry bird hay angry birds!!!!!! get this app. I recommend this to people who like funny apps! :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I purchased a bible for 14.99 when I first got my kindle. It was very important to me that the words of Christ were in red, and there were other features that were important. So that bible had it all and I bought it. I just downloaded and used this one and I can't believe that it was free. It is everything you need. The words of Christ are in red. Finding chapters and verses is so easy. You can take notes and so much more. I wanted something easy to use to follow the sermons and to do my sunday school lessons and boy did I get it. I still love my other one and it will be my daily reading bible, problem is when I skip around it seems to lose the bookmark. So with this one I don't have to worry about that. This is a must have, even if you own several bibles on your kindle, try this one. I was absolutely amazed, and it will probably be the one that I open when the sermon starts in the morning.<br />UPDATE<br />to be to good to be true. This app is only available online. You must agree to their terms which amomg thinds include sharing your information amongst thir partnets. All of the notes etc that you put into your notes, anything and everything that you do is available for others to see and comment on. It may worl for some, but the books concept is what I wannted, but I wanted availablity offline and I wanted this as a private study tool
B000V6583C|5.0|I remember listening to this album in it's entirety in high school and thinking &#34;I have never heard as much pure anger as I have on this album&#34;.  Album is still great after all these years.  GNR in their prime, before they got too much into the synthesizes.  Just pure rock and roll on this album.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It's almost like Gillian Flynn either couldn't figure out how to end it after all the twists and turns or she just gave up! You could take that as a sign that the rest of the book was so good that I am this upset about the ending. But you could also say it was a frustrating read BECAUSE the rest was so good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This was a great gift to receive for my birthday, so many sets to choose from. Great fun, beautiful app. Fun play and easy interface.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|This is a great Christmas CD to own! His voice is amazing!  I am so happy I got it :)

1609419693|5.0|Funny, getting to know Tina Fey book. Arrived in perfect condition and played perfectly. A good autobiography of her life so far.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is probably one of the nicest looking games on tablets. It has a decent campaign along with great multiplayer. If you like call of duty then you will probably like this game. 9.5 out of 10 multiplayer is like modern warfare 3 and black ops 2.
1452604428|4.0|arrived in good conditon and plays perfectly. Had examples and ideas that were interesting and insightful. Talks directly to the topic
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Repetitive. While interesting, I kept waiting for more. The book seemed to drag on in places and not finish in others.
B0019N95IK|5.0|Hey man, I LOVE Enterprise as much as the next guy and have been a fan since the sixties but $84,99 DOLLARS Come ON! (now down to $77 something as of this rewrite 5/9/13)I can buy a the whole Matix series, and the entire Kirk Trek movie series and Picard Trek movie series plus any of the tv series seasons for between 47 and 69 bucks anywhere...does the word \\"Stiff your FANS\\", the same people that made these shows Box Office Hits and FORTUNES for all of you in the first place mean anything?<br />Movieman

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars because it was amazing!! I fell in love the first time I started reading it. It has to be one of the best books I have read in a long time. I would recommend this too anyone who wants a good book to read and enjoy!!!!!! :)
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Not as good as the first one but the picture quality is stunning, the addition of Terror in the aisles makes it a must have for fans of the franchise
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is by far the best book in history! So addictive to read I couldn't put my kindle down !
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I thought this was a light hearted view of what many marriied couples go through.  It had moments that I just laughed out loud and many soft serious moments.  Meryl Streep was awesme!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I hate it! I was going through the tutorial and I had to do something else on my kindle fire for my mom and it wouldn't bring the home button up.. I had restart my kindle fire just to get outta the app!! If you are a person who wants to get out of an app without having to restart you device don't get it!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is by far, one of the best apps on the Market. A must have. I have it for all of my devices.
0765325950|5.0|If you like the more gritty series you probably prefer Martin and the like.  But after reading fantasy books for over 20 years, I realized I prefer the more fantastic tale and the Wheel of Time has it all.  Yes there where issues but for me Rand is the archetypal hero.  A classic hero.  The only disappointing thing is the epilogue was too short and I felt the loose storylines could have been pushed more.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Robert Jordan & Brandon Sanderson
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I had been wanting to purchase this app for a while. Perhaps I am not very smart, but I do not understand the game at all after many tries.<br /><br />Sorry.
0385738765|5.0|Have you read The Maze Runner ? I strongly recommend that if you haven't read the Maze Runner yet then don't read this book first or the review as parts you won't understand and others might ruin the The Maze Runner storyline for you.  In The Scorch Trials, the remaining 50 from The Maze Runner including Thomas and Teresa have escaped the Maze only to discover that they are part of an experiment. The series focuses mainly on Thomas , as we learn through book #1 Thomas plays a very important part in this series. Now escaping The Maze, the group have been sent to Phase #2 The Scorch Trials, in a twist of events the guys from Book #1 will learn that there is a camp identical to theirs except filled with girls and one boy Aris - who holds the same power as Teresa. Just when they thought it was all over the team discovers that they have been affected with a virus and if they don't make it out of the trials in time the virus will take over their bodies and turn them into Cranks. Read as one by one the team gets smaller and smaller and strange markings appear on them - informing their place in this new world. For Thomas though, it seems that there is more than meets the eye as his name starts popping up everywhere and his tattoo warns him that he is to be killed by Group B ( The girls group). With the help of his Maze Runner friends and newfound Scorch Trial friends , can Thomas find them a way out and get to the bottom of why he is important ?<br />A great sequel to The Maze Runner and I look forward to reading the next book in the Quartet - The Death Cure.

B0017SWPXY|3.0|I love dogs and often wonder what they are thinking. This book is written from the dogs perspective with that unconditional love they have for there master. It includes some difficult family dynamics from a caring perspective. But uniquely reveals the frustration of not being able to help.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Unusual twist to the final chapter of Christopher Nolan's trilogy. A departure from the standard superhero dynamic - capping a dark tale of revolution, revenge and redemption.<br /><br />The story opens eight years after 'The Dark Knight'. After so much physical abuse, Bruce Wayne's body is completely shattered. No longer able to become the cape crusader, he's now a recluse who is never seen in public. And having accepted blame in the death of former district attorney Harvey Dent, his alter ego is branded a murderer and public menace, burying the truth about Two-Face to save the reputation and honor of a seemingly good man.<br /><br />Life, such as it is, goes on.<br /><br />Gotham without The Batman still trundles along; crime barely held in check by an increasingly overextended police force. Suddenly a new villain appears. However, unlike most of Batman's gallery of baddies - this one is more than just a linear plain vanilla thug or emotionally damaged lunatic. He's a man on a mission. The question is what mission? And most importantly, why does it require Bruce himself, not The Batman, to be humiliated and broken?<br /><br />Echos of Ra's al Ghul.<br /><br />Bearing the scars of imprisonment and deep social damage enters Bane. And his goal is nothing less than challenging the notion that a \\"great\\" city like Gotham is nothing more than a societal fac&aacute;de - that the true nature of humanity is one of selfishness and brutal opportunism; that nobility, charity and sacrifice are artificial self-serving constructs.<br /><br />Bane and his supporters are going to reveal the fraudlent mask of civility by tearing it off its collective populace.<br /><br />'Rises' spins off of a convoluted and overly lengthy tale, and despite some visually jarring edits and minor elements of melodrama which rang false, Nolan ultimately delivers a satisfying film. One that I suspect fulfills and defines the superhero genre for a modern, more cynical world. By crafting a tale which delves into the heart of heroism and the people whom are recipients of such, the potential to find the hero in oneself and in others becomes a powerful coda for Nolan and Bale's triumvirate of celluloid work.<br /><br />No costumes, no training. Good people standing up to evil. As simple as that.<br /><br />Finally, does anyone still curse the name Joel Schumacher? When I look back and see the immense accomplishment of the Nolan/Bale vision of The Dark Knight, I can't help but hope in a brighter future for all comic book sourced productions.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />I would be remiss not to express a minor disappointment that Nolan didn't choose to go with the canon approved Lucha Libre form of Bane.<br /><br />Although I haven't read a comic book in nearly three decades, I've been a huge fan of DC Animated for many years. And that interpretation has been a favorite. I so desperately wanted to see the character as depicted in the incredibly enjoyable \\"[[ASIN:B001D0CEAA Knight Time]]\\" or \\"Over The Edge\\".<br /><br />Again, I wasn't unhappy with Nolan's choice of movie direction.

B005LAII80|5.0|Just a heads up, I'm writing this review as someone who hasn't read the comics or seen the Stallone movie. In fact, all I knew about this franchise beforehand was that the Stallone movie was awful. But as a general movie lover and fan of Karl Urban and Lena Headey, I had hopes that it would at least be fun to watch and have nice visuals.<br /><br />I never expected to be completely blown away.<br /><br />I saw this film in theaters twice, once on opening weekend and again a couple weeks later in 3D. After I saw it the first time, I kept thinking about how good it was and my love for it grew in retrospect until I saw it again. And even the second time, with all my built up appreciation for it, I picked up on more subtleties and loved it more.<br /><br />Plot wise, the movie is great. Nothing out of this world but still engaging and entertaining without falling flat or being cliche. What I love about it is that there aren't too many twists. It's even slightly predictable, which normally I'd think is faulty, but it really works to Dredd's advantage. Because it completely immerses you in the experience. What this movie does extremely well is bring you into Mega City One's atmosphere and lets you experience the suspense.<br /><br />It's a high stakes cat-and-mouse story line with a concise but intriguing backstory, a temperamental villain with a tendency for extreme violence, and completely ridiculous odds against our heroes. What makes it so special is the extreme scale. This is a city that houses 800 million people (that's almost three times the entire population of the US) in a stretch of land from Washington D.C. to New York. This is a manhunt inside Peach Trees, a half-mile high building the size of a city block. This is two people fighting for their lives and for order in a place where people are either trying to kill them, or couldn't care less what happens to them.<br /><br />What really shines in this movie is the characterization. We have Dredd, the title character, who strictly sticks to regulations and will take any measure to make sure his job gets done. Anderson, a psychic Judge hopeful, on a pass or fail test in the field. And Ma-Ma, a psychotic gang leader who wants Dredd and Anderson dead at any cost.<br /><br />What I love about these characters is that they are extremists in an extreme world. They know the stakes, they understand the risks they take, and they have strong convictions about how the world should work. Each of them backs every action they take 150%. No hesitation, no questions.<br /><br />Another thing that makes the characters of Dredd so special is that the female characters are treated no differently than the male characters, which I find to be especially important.<br /><br />There are so many films where female characters exist solely to provide character development for male protagonists, or as romantic interests, or as background stories. But in Dredd, they steal the show. Ma-Ma is the most powerful criminal in Peach Trees, the most dangerous leader of the most dangerous gang. She is the law of her world and she will take no prisoners. Anderson is an up-and-comer, she's not even a Judge, but she gets results Dredd wouldn't be able to obtain. She has no qualms about doing her job and the brutality it entails. And get this: her uniform is stylistically and fundamentally exactly the same as Dredd's. They are equals.<br /><br />I'm actually angry. I'm angry this movie barely made any money, because it's one of the best films I've seen this year. Top Five, easily. And I'm excited to own it because now I can sit down everyone I know, show it to them, and have them love it, too.cter, who strictly sticks to regulations and will take any measure to make sure his job gets done.

In typical Grisham style he had me guessing until the end; but about two thirds of the way through I thought I had the ending figured out but thought to myself &#34;it can't be that simple&#34;.  Unfortunately it was and I was a little disappointed with the simplistic nature of the ending.

B009NXV2RK|4.0|I hadn't read a Clancy novel for quite a while and when I saw that this one included Jack Ryan Jnr. as a character I thought I have to have a read.  I was a bit sceptical of the authorship given the death of Tom Clancy (am I mistaken?), but decided to purchase anyway.  Glad I did.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable story full on intrigue, believable political scenarios and well researched.  It left me excited, frightened and on the edge the whole way through.  It was great to catch up with some old friends along the way.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who has enjoyed a Tom Clancy novel in the past; you will not be disappointed.

If it's easy enough that a 3 year old can do it by mistake, then it shouldnt be on there at all!

B006LSZECO|3.0|After reading a number of reviews regarding this novel, I was genuinely excited to get started reading Gone Girl. The dialogue was stimulating, the concept fresh, the characters complex and interesting....but the author boxed herself into a corner and as the book climaxed...bang!!! Gone is right, down the tubes, the cleverness, inventive approach just turned into another dead end, imagine if you will ending. Sad for such a promising start. IT's fun to read and be engaged with intelligent dialogue, great twists, but contain your expectations because it ultimately falls flat...for this reader.<br />I am truly surprised that others have raved so lavishly about this novel, its a good 3 star book IMHO.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Very good line. Acting a little off. Could have been the script. Special affects were not much. Worth a rental.
0316069434|5.0|micharel connelly i love this book, here is a case that was in the cold case file for many years. Then harry bosch gets the case and he works it. His bosses tell him to give up on the case but he keeps digging and because of him he uncovers a new turn in the case and solve everthing I enjoy the how he can work the case and still make time for his daughter and be a careing father no matter what comes up with tis case,it is great to see how the love they have for each other as well as the recpect.This is a man who did'nt know about raise his daughter untill her mother passway and they never had a lot of time together.So it is good to se how they have grown and love each other. If you want to read a good book and enjoy the mystery that is well put together and meet a cop that has heart and care about  his case and the people and what justice at the same time harry bosh is your man. I THINK YOU SHOULD READ ALL OF THE HARRY BOSH NOVEL BY MICHAEL CONNELLY.

B000OVLINI|5.0|It reminded me of a time when books were well written.  It actually used word that had more than one syllable. I find many &#34;best sellers&#34; now are written for morons. You dont have to think and you ALWAYS know hat is going to happen. This book has some surprises. I really enjoyed it.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|Although the book is a very easy read from front to back, I found myself wishing it was over plenty of times after the halfway mark.  Moneyball praises an idea more than it tells a story.

1619695006|1.0|Got through three of the discs but couldn't find enough interest to finish the book.  The characters just didn't interest me, despite my hope that they somehow snap out of the doldrums they are in.  And the thought of listening to the remaining 12 discs did not make me happy.  I was NOT put off by the language; instead, I thought it entirely appropriate to the story, to the grittiness of the lives  of the protagonists.  But the story didn't hold my interest.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i had it befor then my kindle broke so i have to start all over but other then that its addicking and fun
B0086700CM|3.0|okay i love the game very much but it freezes up so i delted it then re downloaded and it did the same thing!!!!!!'
B00884GR0W|4.0|First off.. I am giving the game 4 instead of 5 stars because I do think the controls are a bit shaky and could be a bit better and a type of map would be great. Other than that I think it's a great game.<br /><br />I have no idea why so many people say they don't get it. Games are supposed to be a bit challenging so don't expect everything to be laid out for you. In one part I got the wood and I got lost and after much exploring I found Ted again. It is NOT a bad game because some of you can't figure out how to play.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Although I am not very far into this book, it intrigues me because of the author's desire to reverse a long time bias he and probably many others had about all German pilots of WWII.  It is well written and a story that should be told.  Even though I am writing this very early into the book, I am sure that my opinion will not be any different at the end.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|the selection of tools on this unit is great and easy to select and use. the holster, however is very poor quality and ripped out after only a week of use. the little pocket for the survival guide needs to be eliminated as it hinders inserting the tool easily.<br />over all, I'm happy with the tool.

It delivers a wider sound stage and isolates the bass a lot better than an onboard soundcard can do. It's a great upper middle ground for a portable DAC/Amp.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Fun n busy. Love it.<br />She loves hunting for things that pop up on the ground and matching up best friends.
B0064U8GYC|5.0|Got this for my iPad on the Kindle app. It's great. I think its better than the hard copy since you have the ability to use find and store notes. After going through the book, its all there for reference anyway. Whats better than ctrl+f ???
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I end up reading a lot of pdfs and this made it easy to find them as well as to read them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me from chapter one.  I loved the story and at first, I thought it was going to be the typical love story...boy meets girl, they fall in love, and have hot steamy love scenes.  Well, the book includes all of that, but it really is so much more.  The story line is brilliant, heartbreaking, and inspiring.  I have read Colleen Hoover's other two books and I would recommend all three of these books.  I look forward to reading more of her work, sooner rather than later.

B003ZHVJFA|5.0|This is actually a pretty entertaining movie.  I am not really a big fan of the tekken games and find most video game movies to be pretty bad, but something about this movie makes me want to watch it over and over again.  Sure it is a little cheesy at some points(but not half as bad as most video game movies) and the acting is not going to win any awards, but over all i found the movie to be pretty fun to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was wonderful. I saw the movie 1st which was a huge mistake!! It doesn't even scratch the surface of how deeply all the characters think and feel. The story is very complex and I can't wait to start the next book!
B002VHI8FE|4.0|The book has great action, and an interesting world, but the best thing about it is the way the main characters are portrayed. The author has a good grasp of creating characters that are intriguing, and not always likeable.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun. My daughter who got the game likes it. She plays it all the time and likes it
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a good book for someone with a little age on them.  The time period and the characters were well developed but flawed.  A twist on the slave/master storyline.  I loved the display of the timeline and grooming of the characters.  Was taken by surprise as the plot thickened.  To have the story go the way it did was welcome.  The Help and this were good reads.  These books I'll pick up later in life to re-read again and again
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I will not get that time I spent watching this back. It was just a train wreck...you couldn't turn away.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|\\"Radiant\\" is evidently a take on the classic game Galaxion, and it does enough to make it original, creative, and innovative.<br /><br />Story & Basis -<br />You are Max Blaster, and there is an alien armada that wants to destroy all of humanity. That's all the story you need, because you will plow through every single alien you see to defeat the armada and save the world. In a game where you're blasting through almost endless number of aliens in a space ship in space, how much of a story do you really need? Still, \\"Radiant\\" gives a great twist on the storyline mostly because the developers do a fantastic job of adding hilarious dialogue between the leader of the aliens, the commander of your space fleet, and your character. This dialogue is non-intrusive as it gives you option to skip, and it only occurs in between rounds.<br /><br />Graphics -<br />\\"Radiant\\" features beautiful neon-style graphics, and although the graphics are 8-bit, this is intentional and still incredible. \\"Radiant\\" features many 8-bit enemies and bosses that look very well done, and for a mobile game Radiant comes on par with many other arcade games. Each weapon that you can utilize in \\"Radiant\\" looks great too, and the animations for enemy deaths and shooting is simplistic yet satisfying.<br /><br />Music -<br />\\"Radiant\\"'s techno music goes along well with the game's simplistic yet futuristic feel, and it accompanies \\"Radiant\\" very well.<br /><br />Gameplay & Value -<br />In \\"Radiant\\" you only move left and right in order to evade enemy attacks and attack them yourself. Unlike Galaxian (and Galaga), \\"Radiant\\" features a full rank-up system that gives you access to various types of weaponry that you buy and upgrade through credits that random aliens' drop as you play. This works very well as the number and strength of the alien's you face grow at an even to proportion as you, while still making it worth while to test each weapon as you slaughter the aliens. The only problem I face at times isthat if you don't get lucky at the aliens dropping fair amounts of credits, although some drops are forced, you may not be able to stand up to the later waves well. \\"Radiant\\" features three different difficulty levels depending on your skill level, and each one of these is entirely separated so that you can aim for high scores in the leaderboards for each one. There are three levels for each difficulty, and depending on which difficult you play on, you may experience slightly varied level progression.<br /><br />At first glance, three levels in three different difficulties seems rather lacking, but I can assure you that each level takes over an hour to play. Even after you complete them all though, the leaderboards give you an incentive to beat your best score and try to move your way up in the world ranking. It it definitely worth the price, and the many bosses you face as you progress are challenging and original, giving the game some more variety.<br /><br />In addition to bosses and a rank-up system though, randomly dropped power-ups such as freezing all enemies on the screen and obliterating all enemies on screen add another element that I feel is well received.<br /><br />Conclusion -<br />I'm not a huge fan of the Galaxian-type games, but I must say that this is the one I can not only bear to play, but really enjoy. At times it can be tedious to play due to the drop system being rather random and credits being essential to beat later stages, but this is as good as it gets for classic arcade greatness. This is not a \\"rip-off\\" of an old arcade game, but rather a modern reinvention.<br /><br />And, on a final note, at least this company is one that isn't afraid to change an old system if they feel they can something more to it, and that alone should make any player of this game respect it, at the very least.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|Great show. One of my favs. Love every thing about it. A must have for your collection. Now I just need 4-7
B004LWZWGK|4.0|gave this as a gift and finally had a chance to see it. the movie itself is ok, but some of the dialogue is hard to hear, especially from bane. a few areas of the movie dragged, but overall it was ok. i watched the ultraviolet copy and for the most part the picture quality was fine, but there was a bad skip we couldn't find an explanation for. later i found out the skip didn't cut out anything important, just made the scene awkward and jumpy.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The 25th Anniversary Concert production features a great cast. Definitely worth the purchase. Happy to have my own copy of it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all three of Nolan's Batman movies, though \\"Batman Begins\\" was my favorite- I simply enjoyed the concept of Bruce Wayne's training in a fortress of disciplined ninjas, as well as the unconventional, relatively unknown villains of Ras al Ghoul and Scarecrow. However, \\"The Dark Knight\\" was awesome (just not my favorite), and this third film does a fine job of completing Nolan's venture into Batman's world.<br /><br />I was actually putting off watching this movie, because I didn't want to commit three hours. But once I finally began it, I was sucked in, just as I have been with all of Nolan's movies. He sure knows how to open... the initial scene is quite breathtaking, and I have been continually impressed with how this series has introduced inventive, complex stunts that have never been seen before. Also, it must be mentioned- watching this on a big screen makes a huge difference!<br /><br />While I was initially skeptical of the length of this movie, the pacing is done so well that I didn't notice the exorbitant length of time that it ran for. For the most part, the acting is top notch (though Batman's combat seemed a little too telegraphed and slow this time around- perhaps because he's been out of the game for so long). The story was well told, and parts of it strongly reminded me of Nolan's presentation in \\"Memento\\" and \\"The Prestige\\", which was pretty cool. He has a unique take on cinematography that nobody else has been able to duplicate, and his movies are a pleasure to watch- \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is no exception.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is easy to learn with all of the examples being reviewed in the first few games. The last few of the puzzles are pretty difficult. One issue I had with the game is that if you're stuck on one puzzle you can't leap frog it and go to the next. That's when I'd shut down Quell and click over to Spider Solitaire.<br /><br />Sometimes you just need to wait for that aha moment.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun to play. You run out of energy pretty quick and investment point bring your progress to a bulge in a hurry
1451629192|5.0|What she went through and survived is truly a miracle. A must read.  Jaycee is a survivor with a story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm have become a huge Colleen Hoover fan!! Loved Slammed and Point of Interest so I gave Hopeless a try. I was awesome. I loved the characters and the ending was not what I was expecting at all. Couldn't put it down!
B009IQG5LK|4.0|A beautiful transfer but sadly no special features! I would have loved a doc on creating the makeup, sets and costumes.  Also a great Danny Elfman score and fantastic songs by Sondheim.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Simple as that, game is addicting and a little morbid but great fun. Game evolves as you get better providing more challenges.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This album is amazing. the artist is amazing. the sound, just everything. its quiet, peaceful, and brilliant. This is a great album to add to your music collection.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book it is very similar to Fifty Shades of Grey and I loved that book which made me love this one also.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is a great album. The Lumineers are an awesome new band with an awesome sound.<br />if you like songs are real stuff, you'll enjoy this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love these movies so I thought I would try out the game. I love the game, it's fun but its time consuming.
030758836X|4.0|Talk about getting revenge-  it's one thing to bring your man home, it's another to make him submit!  This woman creates a web of deceit so tangled, she even gets lost in it.  Read and love.  Flynn had me from page one - the ending (I must admit) was a cheat, but it's still worth the read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and when you're bored its fun to play. I would use this app again because it's fun.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|World From the Side of the Moon is better then I thought.  Phillip Phillips is amazing! Great CD. I love it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this series! It was an amazing book. Not something I would normally read but after you read farther it's like you want to know what happens next so you keep reading!
B000002JPA|5.0|This is a very talented group. This Images and Words album is really the only one I like with them.<br /><br />James LaBrie - Lead Vocals, tambourine<br /><br />John Petrucci - Lead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar<br /><br />John Myung - Bass Guitar<br /><br />Mike Portnoy - Drums<br /><br />Kevin Moore - Keyboard<br /><br />After Kevin Moore left I didn't care for next one's style. It's just not the same. Bass Guitarist doesn't always stand out and to get credit but this bass guitarist really play many notes, he jams probabaly more then any I heard I'm thinkin.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this series! It was an amazing book. Not something I would normally read but after you read farther it's like you want to know what happens next so you keep reading!

B004SOR4H6|5.0|Who doesn't love twitter? (: Works pretty nicely and I love twitter. I haven't had a problem with it at all.
1423140605|5.0|If you have been reading the series you will know that Rick keeps you on your toes...lots of adventure with a bit of history thrown in...great for a bit of light reading.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the first book so I knew that I would love the second book. I got it on my kindle.
0156030306|5.0|Read this in school when I was a kid and my daughter is reading it now. We received this as expected in perfect shape.
B005HSL626|5.0|Its time consuming. I get addicted because it's fun. There isn't much too it and it's easy to learn how to play.
145162607X|5.0|I have yet to find a historical fiction book of Phillipa's that I did not like, and this one is no exception....AWESOME!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this series! It was an amazing book. Not something I would normally read but after you read farther it's like you want to know what happens next so you keep reading!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A great story to get wrapped up in. A fun way read that leaves you smiling. my first book by Mira Kelly but not my last.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I got this for my Dad for a Birthday Present. He absolutely loves it! I'm glad I bought it on Amazon. It was not damaged at all either. Great DVD
B0094K1K42|5.0|She is someone that represents what society deems exceptional. She's out of her mind and doesn't see that her efforts are having the opposite effect of her intentions.<br /><br />She is a representation of aesthetics misconstrued.............her character is rugged and enduring,graceful and dark.
B0079KT81G|5.0|One of the greatest stories of all time (Bible Asside).  I highly recommend it if you like a good story.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I pre-orded the movie and was tempted to go get it the day that it came out in stores but luckily it arrived at my doorstep the day of its release. I was very happy!
B004GYY714|5.0|What a diversity in radio stations!  Love having audio access to the world like that. I would give it a five star rating
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great acting with an impressive cast and the storyline has a unique and interesting twist on time travel. It's a movie that I definitely watch again with a friend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's different. Crazy different, but good different- it's great! Leaves much to think about and it opens up a new perspective. It shows you a whole other side to a love story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so cool but not as cool as grace because I<br /> like her very much. she is cooler than finding gold in minecraft.&quot;GO MINEVRAFT&quot;!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|greatgreat great why no award for this great story , it was a good story to everyone that reading is good
B007SGM084|4.0|i was surprised how good these book are. i couldn't  put them down .  it was a good read i thought.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|If you need to get a stereo digital audio signal back to analog, there is no better or cheaper way to do it.
B003B02O14|5.0|Having read all John Grisham books and hearing the audio books, one never tires of revisiting them, like old friends.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Made me think of some of the Heinlein Juveniles. Completely modern and not a lot like Heinlein's style but the same feeling about engineering and problem solving.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This is a fun and sassy story about a different time and place that I hope we never return to. I am an Emma Stone fan and it was well acted. I enjoyed this movie.
B008N9AASC|5.0|Be sure to set aside uninterrupted time in a dark room to watch this movie nonstop from beginning to end, no distractions. The most astounding movie I have seen in 50 years. Be sure to watch the eyes.
034580404X|3.0|I read it d/t all the hub bub, but it became redundant....if I had to read &#34;the apex of my thighs&#34; even one more time. Mix it up a bit.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|It is slow and I feel hard to use I also did not realize I would have to pay for this service. There are other free sites I can store my pictures for free.
B009186JYI|4.0|Don't watch this expecting the notorious \\"C.S. Blues\\" (which is more depressing than titillating to tell you the truth) or something along the lines of \\"Don't Look Back\\". At just over an hour, you see a bunch of young guys goofing around, hanging out, trying to take it all in, but they're all having fun and none of the debauchery (at least on camera) they became notorious for later on. It's good to see Brian Jones being funny and thoughtful before it became the Mick & Keef show and watching him in his decline on the \\"Rock and Roll Circus\\".<br /><br />If you've seen \\"The Beatles First US Visit\\", it's pretty similar. No naked groupies and smashing TVs.<br /><br />I know they have a deluxe edition of this, but I can't imagine the quality on Blu Ray for this film looking any better than the regular DVD. I would've liked to have seen a single live disc either included with the DVD or sold separately, instead of withholding it so people could buy the box set (and prob. could be found on a file share site).<br /><br />Also on the DVD, you can see the work they put into restoring this in the bonus section.<br /><br />I'm glad this movie which made the bootleg rounds for years was revisited and improved on.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|'Intense' that's the word that kept coming to my mind while reading this book,much like Holder's character. I mean you can not go through this book without getting your emotions involved. Maybe I felt more involved than most because of my experience as a child. I also had similar experiences as more than half of world's female population experiences(Although not to that degree!) and it makes me sad to think that a defenseless child should go through this. I have a daughter and I would die before I let this happen to her. But sometimes the people who are supposed to protect you do the unthinkable. I could relate to the fear and feeling of hopelessness.<br />That said, I felt Holder's character was a bit confusing. there were somethings he did which were left unexplained. I did like Sky's character though! And Karen, I loved her.<br />I have read 'slammed' and 'Point of retreat' by Colleen Hoover. I loved both of them, so I had to read her newest. I was surprised to see 1000+ 5 star reviews of a novel released 15 days back. But after reading this I understand. It's so intense and remain in your mind after ending that you need to talk about it. And that's what I am doing!:-)
B00005Y1UX|5.0|I've watched this movie twice since I got it. The story is both romantic and<br />tragic at the same time. It makes you wonder at how people can demolish their lives so easily. You don't know how this one is going to turn out. Demi, Woody and Robert are terrific actors. You like them all, but you can't help wanting to<br />either give them a swift kick in the rear, or just wait and hope everything turns out all right in the end.  Get this movie, you won't regret it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm totally just blown away by this book. Not only how compelling story is but right down to the detail of these two's relationship! I just absolutely fell in love with Sky and Holder is off the charts the most amazing guy I've ever seen in a book before. He gives this book the courage of ever becoming alive or will to keep going. Omg sky broke my heart and she give so much inspiration at same time. Every time I thought I couldn't take anymore Colleen wrote this book just perfect so that you can keep going. Thank you Colleen for you having courage to write such a beautiful story and be able to make people laugh,cry, and most of all give hope!
B007SGM084|5.0|have read the books but wanted it on my kindle so i can reread if I want.  they keep you interest and you can't put it down.
0064430170|4.0|Got this book for my son he likes it. I got it for a great deal and will most likely try to get as a gift for a baby shower or a birthday.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|What makes this movie different from the others of the past few years is that this movie isn't about singing your way through anything, it's about singers. This is a true romantic musical comedy. WATCH IT!
B009738XXM|5.0|Great value for the price I paid. My kids are not too much into the artist, but they enjoy listening, since it's already in their ipod.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|Not as expected and will be returning it. Wanted to be able to leave KIndle in as I read.<br />Have not used it and will return first of week.
B008CP6RWU|1.0|I purchased this game, since it's the best selling strategy game at Amazon and 4 1/2stars, how bad could it be. Don't get fooled!<br />-Graphic on some of the game is worst I've seen since Atari days.<br />-There are no manual explaining how to play games.<br />-They brag about how they created this game within 24hours, but<br />-Main Menu page, where you select games are just boxes of icon with out description and images. It's little stupid to know that you selected wrong game after it's been downloaded.<br />-The game has subliminal message of new age or something.<br /><br />I'm starting to think that reviews are written by manufacturer them selves. This is not the first item with such disappointment with good review at Amazon.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|You will really like this Book trust me its amazing. I really don't like reading but i liked reading this book
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|I have read most of the Jack Reacher books, so I fully expected to hate the movie.  In my mind, Jack Reacher looks, acts and sounds just like Jim Caviezal.  How could Tom Cruise ever convince anyone that he was Jack?  When we got to the theatre, the poster proclaiming that \\"Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher\\" made me cringe.  But, within 15 minutes of the opening credits, Tom won me over!  I loved the movie...I laughed, I cried, and I got lost in the action.  We've seen it twice!  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the unecessary profanity that is not in the books, but that's my only complaint.  Now, I'm waiting to see whose face comes to mind when I read the next Reacher book!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was the first Angry Birds which I ever learned, I learned it on my friends Kindle before I even got my own Kindle Fire from Santa for Christmas this past Christmas 2012!  It is a fun game!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not a bad ending but the mockingjay gets a bit over emotional in this one.  I did not understand the tween label until this book.  Over all a quick and fun series but nothing beats the first one.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I like the variety of seasons available, I have not even tried them all yet.  I was having a hard time with the Christmas one.  The one bird I do not like is the one which lays the egg.  For some reason I can't seem to get the timing correct and the pigs remain laughing at me, with that evil laugh, which can be a little frustrating!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|It was ok enough for me to buy the second book but after that, I was done.  Then again, in a pinch I'll read the back of a toilet paper package.<br /><br />It's obvious the author has never seen a real firearm, so it's hard to write convincingly about a weapons expert...
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like reading my tweets on my kindle fire, I read more than I write them myself.  It is fun to read my favorite celebrities tweets!  Sometimes I reply to their tweets, but I usually don't create too many of my own.  I don't really desire to have lots of followers.  I just like reading what the others have to say!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show!  The writing and acting is brilliant.  It is so entertaining to watch how the characters,nobility and servants, lives seem so seperate yet often overlap.
B00846REIS|3.0|While an entertaining read, it did not compare with fifty shades of gray.  Bared to you is the PG version of Fifty shades.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the most inspirational books I've ever read and not much less. I can't explain how much it changed me.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This is a fantastic book! So easy to read. It pulls you in a doesn't let you go until the very last page, and the sequel it just as good. A must read.
6305428425|5.0|This is one movie I can watch over and over and over again and again and laugh my socks off.  Wish I went to high school with Romy and Michelle.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|I adore this book! It's one of the best books I've ever read. Definitely the best I've read in a well. Any fantasy fan should read this. :)
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore always hits the nail on the head when getting his point across. I LOVE Michael Moore films. &#60;3
B00A77II0U|4.0|This was a lot of fun. My only issue was that between cut scenes, it tended to freeze. But, otherwise, another great game from the best app creators, Alawar. Now where's the third Snarkbusters game?
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book 5 is a complex continuation of the prelude to the war for Westeros. Book 4 had left me wondering about the continuation of the stories of the north, the Imp, Daenerys and others, and this book gives a good account to bring us up to date.  I only hope Mr. Martin will finish book 6 shortly so we can really get into the meat of all this soon!!  In the meantime, there is so much to consider in light of our own international turmoil.<br />  I went back and read some of the reviews.  You know, I remember back when we were believing in The Age of Aquarius and I've been waiting for over 40 years for it to show up.  Talk about tedium.  I have no idea what Martin is going to do, but there were surprises in this book, just like in real life.  I think this series is a lot more fascinating than the hobbit series, and that's not putting that series down.  I'm up for a long prelude during a long winter!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good way to entertain myself! Works really<br /> good too! Love the game and play on downloading more of the games like this one
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|It's so easy to review GeorgeHarrison.....we love his music.  Every GeorgeHarrison record is simply the finest music to the ears.....If you've followed George from any starting point then you've already got it, if this is your starting point, then you will learn.....George is mellow enough and George can rock with the best.....try it and see.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a fun game for all ages I think.If you like the show you will like this.- Rainbow dashical Brony
0375507507|5.0|I have read three of Alexandra Fuller's books. This is my favorite. The story begins, written by a young Alexandra, told almost abruptly, with both passion and a nonchalance at the same time.  It is told as she lived it.  Her 'unstructured' family, living in the bush of Africa, experiences both the agony and ecstasy of living in wild places, caring for wild animals and each other.  I have recommended this book to several friends without an African connection.  They all enjoyed it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was astounding!! I highly recommend it!! Very worth your time.Make sure to read all three books or you'll be missing out!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Oh my goodness!!  Exciting!  Kept me engrossed and wanting to know more.  Great details to get a good mind picture of what is happening.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A story of a deep love for someone mixed in with forbidden rules and dark magic that unfolds as you read!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a while.  It is a great southern gothic novel that will hold your attention till the very end.  The characters are so flawed and complex that you will spend hours thinking about them while you are not reading.
1932735410|3.0|A few days ago I purchased the new PMBoK 5th Edition. Today I received a promotional email from Amazon offering this 7th edition of Rita's PMP Exam Prep along the PMBoK 5thEd picture.<br />Amazon: Be aware this was a wrong promotion as this version of the Rita's PMP Prep Exam book is only for the PMBoK 4th edition, that is for PMP exams scheduled for dates up to July 31st. I guess RMC will probably offer an 8th edition designed with the next PMP exam, i.e. for the PMBoK 5th edition content.<br />Nice sort of promotion to get rid of inventories.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game that challenges you to get stars and help save the pudding from being eaten. There are over 50 levels to complete. Watch out for the green slime pudding.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|The quality of this performant is great. It starts outin the sunlight and ends after sunset.<br />The sound quality is one of the best I have for a performance out side.<br />The guest pianist was won of my favorites.
B000YHG72E|4.0|I thought I would hate this film, as I usually don't care for Will Ferrell, but I really enjoyed watching this on Christmas eve with my family of sentimental adult children!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Vulgarity for vulgarity's sake is not funny.  Neither is the gratuitous use of swear words.  There is nothing surprising about the dialogue or the story line.  If there are no surprises, then there are no laughs.  I stopped watching half an hour into the film.
B002HFJ77S|4.0|So enjoy the books by this author.  Humor along with a great story line, this one had a touching ending.
1419701533|5.0|This was the first time he applied himself to reading purely for pleasure and without being forced to.  I am so grateful to these books and so happy my grandson has discovered the JOY of reading.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like checking my email every now and then. I don't know what else to say about it, it is email yay?
0765325950|5.0|I read the hardcover.  Yes, it was bulky but it was an inconvenience I could live with in order to read the book as soon as possible.  I wish that people would restrict their reviews to the actual story and not distort the Amazon rating with whining and threats.  The publisher has the right to stagger release of hardcover, paperback and e-book editions.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I have always loved the Final Fantasy RPGs. I hope they get more out for the kindle. It is good times.
B008OTTSX4|5.0|I bought this CD because I'm a big fan of the original Machine Head Album and like nost of the groups who perform on this tribute album. I have to say that even the bands I didn't know or don't particularly like did an EXCELLENT job paying tribute to one of rock's most iconic band-Deep Purple. Check it out-you won't be let down.
B007C7UZIG|3.0|It's Steam on my tablet. What else is there to say about it? I guess it would be cool if Steam had tablet games you could buy off the app.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|The author's views are very interesting.  Age as a factor in sports or school has always been known to teachers.  My area allows school entrance with birthdays up to about through October.  So children born in November, December and January have an age advantage in sports and studies.<br /><br />A few weeks after reading the Outliers, I am still thinking about its views and their impact.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This is a very good app.  It seems to have information on everyone and everything, and all you have to do is put in the subject.<br />Bad part about search engines such as google is when you put in your subject, you get tons of choices, and you have to keep working until you get the information you are searching for.  I do love Wikipedia.
B00631HASU|3.0|I'm disappointed because the application won't download to my android tablet.  I was really looking forward to playing but these isn't evem an option on the digital orders to re-download an app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some games are lame and repetative but others are quite challenging and fun. Really good when you have some spare time.
B000FZETKC|5.0|If you like &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; and movies of that genre, you will like Some Kind of Wonderful.  Without giving a plot summary (see other reviews or websites for a good synopsis), this movie has comedy, romance, drama, and a good story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Cool existing  fun this book will keep you guessing till the end .if you have read the first book then it will be even better
B007SYWFRM|5.0|wondurful game its really easy to learn in fact I know a four year old that plays it overall great
193609648X|4.0|Excellent, as always but too much lacey, frilly stuff and not enough meat.  Some very nice sweaters.  I'll use it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't stop watching this series. The characters are good, the plots intriguing and suspense engaging, not to mention scary and nail biting. Can't wait for the second half of season 3.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Trying to catch up on Season 5 - enjoying it so far.  This is a great cop comedy-drama  that I am addicted to.
0062202081|5.0|I am a mother of a preteen and this book has all the necessary elements to make a fan happy. Lots of pictures and facts and beautifully put together.    [...]
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down!! Lots of twists and turns. HOLDER is an sexy awesome character! One of the best books I've read in a while.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|a pageturner for romantic souls and amateurs of beautiful (old) english prose. Dickens' narrative style is beyond competition. A must-read !
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Read this book when I was seventeen years old and it has been one of my staple books that I read once a year since then. The world she creates is fantastic, the characters are unique, believable, and entertaining, the plot has so many twists and turns it'll make your head spin, and it's just an overall unbelievably good book by an unbelievably talented author. I would not suggest this book for really young kids simply because my younger sister did not enjoy it at 12 because she couldn't keep up with the confusing plot twists. Also, if you've heard of or watched the Anime movie, be prepared that this is nothing like the movie (they are both awesome, but completely different).
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really enjoyed this game wish it was longer but other then that really fun. Hope there will be a sequel.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|one of the best books in all time definitely five star material great book for kids of the world happy reading
B003MYYJD0|5.0|If you are looking for a big heavy watch this is a great one. Keep great time and looks good even on my small wrist.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read the book in two days! I couldn't put it down! Colleen Hoover has a way of writing that makes you feel like you're part of the story, conversing casually with friends. It sucks you in. This book made me laugh, cry and swoon! All I know is that I didn't want the story to end! I'm hopelessly hoping for a part 2...and 3 =)
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|good read on what exponential tech trends might mean for developed economies, the proposed solutions are not clean if they are going to help or no but at least makes the reader to pay attention to this pernicious concern
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love it! I am addicted to it! I  l love that you do not have to wait a full day to play again like some games.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book from the very first page when it gets your attention all the way through to the end. Very good book.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought this baby doll a few years ago for my little girl. Now my 2nd little girl is playing with it and it is still holding up well. She still has that sweet mellow smell. Excited for my 3rd little girl to love this baby too!
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I was so excited to get this collection and watch them. However, when I opened the dvd case the dvd's fell out. The case was broken before I even received it. Also the dvd's don't fit in the box correctly. I recommend that you don't purchase this item from this user. It kind of ruined my day. You're better off going to a store and saving the hassle of trying to return it or fix the problem yourself.
0345803485|5.0|I really loved this book.  It truly is the fantasy that I think most women think about. Puts you in  a good place
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game but I would like it to have every thing in the pc version but everything else is great
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book is practically identical to 50 Shades of Gray.  I feel I have to keep reading it thought, since I paid for it.  Truthfully though, how does this happen.  It's like the names were changed
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even though this is my second time reading this part of the trilogy, it still got me to experience various emotions. This series will always be a favorite, and I will definitely be sharing it with my kids one day.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the characters and the depth of detail each was given in the book.  the author of the book delivered entertainment, historical value and educational enrichment with each page of the book.  Honestly this book could easily be shared by all types of readers- young & old a like.
B001NHNG64|5.0|If you start this book be sure you don't have a lot of plans for a few days. You might get hooked like I did and miss your semi annual teeth cleaning. I was hooked after the first paragraph.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I didn't really plan on playing it. I only got it for my sister but when I started playing it I couldn't stop!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book of the century. Collins writes yet another page turner filled with details. I loved The Hunger Games and am reading Catching Fire while literally sitting on the edge of my seat.
B006W33UC4|5.0|Tom Moulton, is one of the great dj/remixers of the time, and has even influenced others like Dimitri. It is great to have long versions of &#34;Backstabbers&#34;, and &#34;When will I see you again&#34; as well as other treasures..
0824835921|3.0|It is important to note what this book is designed to teach you and what it is not.<br /><br />The book covers: how to write the general use kanji, using a key word to associate with each, and a little story that is designed to help you remember it.<br /><br />The book does not cover: anything else.<br /><br />I am not advanced enough in my study of Japanese to determine whether it is better to strip down the kanji in this way or to take the more traditional approach learning the different usages and whatnot all at once. I can see where the latter way could be overwhelming, but I see one clearly positive aspect to Heisig's approach. Since he's not concerned with covering the most commonly used kanji first, or their reading or anything else, he is free to organize the kanji based on how you write them. He introduces you to some basic elements, then shows how they combine to make other kanji. When the combinations are exhausted, he brings in one or two new elements and then shows how they work together with the existing set. Rinse and repeat. I think this is very helpful and probably the best part of the method. In the end, you're going to cover them all anyway, right? So why not take a systematic approach like this? Oh, but make sure to read the introduction, then read the opening text in Lesson 5. He waits until Lesson 5 to explain how he wants you to learn the kanji. Huh? Doing this makes the author come across as a smarmy jerk.<br /><br />The stories he writes up for the characters are a mixed bag. Some have been most helpful in remembering the kanji. Some are convoluted, taking more time and thought to make sense of than it would take to simple memorize the character. Some are downright bizarre or false. I am disturbed by some of his references to cultural Christianity that have no bearing in the true faith, and the thought that he is teaching these lies as truth in his day job as a professor of religion.<br /><br />Finally, the fatal flaw. In his method, he wants you to dwell on the key word, read the story slowly, lock in the abstract concept, then write the kanji once. He recommends flashcards for review, yes, but he specifically says you should not repeatedly write the kanji when you're learning it. This is malarkey. The human brain learns and remembers from practice and repetition. The kanji from the first four lessons, where I was writing each character ten times as I learned it, are well established in my memory. The ones after that, where I followed his instructions exactly and excluded this repetition, are lost on me. There is a reason the Japanese learn the kanji by rote. Heisig claims it's because children lack the imagination to use their whole brains (which gives away the fact that he must be childless himself). No, the Japanese learn that way because it works.<br /><br />I am all for injecting life into the study of language, and employing creative thinking to involve more of your brainpower. So his system and his use of abstract concepts is helpful. A strictly rote study will be too dry and unengaging to endure. But you cannot ignore the necessity of practice as he claims. So, if you're using this as your reference for the common use kanji, make sure you practice writing out each one as you go.
B005LAII80|4.0|Great price. Haven't watched it yet. The price was great for a 3d movie & it arrived in two days. I hope the movie is good with great 3d effects.
1594484805|5.0|A concise, easy to read book that explores what really motivates people to succeed.  Not just in monitary terms but what makes us want to excell at hobbies, relationships and yes, work.  The joy of work is something to be persued.  Managers don't need carrots or sticks if people are fully engaged at what thei're doing.<br /><br />Well woth the time spent reading.  Also am reading his next book &#34;To Sell is Human&#34; and that one is proving to be a good read also.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan has a voice that expresses the emotion of each song she sings. You feel her inside the music, living the songwriters message.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This film has it all.  Exceptional acting.  Interesting characters.  Magic and monsters.  Epic battles.  Odd settings and eery atmospheres.  I was surprised to find this movie so enjoyable.  Yes, I wish they had gone more in depth with the dwarves.  But the plot was gripping enough because the evil ones were quite a handful to overcome.  The world was gritty and fantastic simultaneously.  The magic was always interesting.  The effects are excellent.  If you love fantasy, go for this one.  It is a solid fantasy tale done well.
0446580848|5.0|If you like DeMile, you'll love this one.  For a change the setting is not Long Island, which makes the story a bit more interesting.
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|This is a very cool tale more akin to the author's original story.  This is not a corny remake of the first Total Recall--which itself was a corny rip off of the short story by Dick.  This movie is really intense and interesting.  The action is superb.  The effects and settings are so immersive that you feel like you are in the future world this story proposes.  This is one of those films worth buying because seeing it multiple times is actually worth it.  Good, solid sci-fi action and ideas put to film.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|One of the best sound tracks I ever bought. Definitely worth the money. Not only is this 1 of my favorite movies but Its definitely 1 of my favorite sound tracks.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved the letter format that the book was written in. Very easy to relate to the characters throughout the entire story!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|The story line was imaginative. The build up was exciting but the finish when the investigator of Harry Bosch's indiscretions  (again) rescued our hero was beyond credibility. Needless to say I will still buy the next one!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King always a huge fan of his books and this one is no exception. Excellent keeping me late at night reading it. One of his best for sure.  Thank you Mr. King
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Quick to begin, but gets you right to the heart of the story! Never wanted to put it down. Romance is a good balance, definitely not like 50 shades, which is food because it spent more time on the actual plot!
B00890CBR8|1.0|I was expecting a black T-shirt that said Analog Man on it which would have been perfect for my husband.  Instead it was a white T-shirt that said Joe Walsh for President.  Grrrrrr.  To be fair I should have read the product description before ordering.  Also way too expensive for what it is.  Just the album was $20 and this was way more.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|The movie is pretty juvenile.  If you like a lot of potty mouth and not much plot then this is for you.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a well written fairly easily read considering the medical implications included.<br />I have read several books on tis subject, nut this is the first one that manages not only logical,  but also scientific back-up in a readable manner. It also includes the physiology and anatomy of he humanbrain with those points that cannot be proven nor dis-proven. Some things we must learn to accept by faith.
B007REAIUE|4.0|I've always been a sucker for artists trying to recreate that original rock n roll sound.  Frankly I've never heard an artist capture the late 1950s, early 1960s rock n roll sound better than JD McPherson.  He absolutely nails it.  The album also has a greater variety of songs than one would expect.  The whole CD is listenable and features many standout tracks like 'North Side Gal', 'Dimes for Nickels' and 'Your Love'.  I think even someone who has no appreciation or nostalgia for the early days of rock n roll can thoroughly enjoy this album and I highly recommend it.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|It works a little. Locks up and freezes on my Kindle Fire HD. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now. Every day the same thing. Runs for about half of the movie, then freezes up. Have to shut off the Kindle to get it to run again. If it actually worked, this would be ideal. Easy interface, nice design.
B00632HWOG|5.0|App functions smoothly, very responsive, basic and clutter free interface. Mutch better than the Kindle fire's email app. Highly recommended.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|I got this along with a Cosmos case.  It screws in the threads on the xz-1 lens and pops open when you use the camera.<br /><br />So you get rid of the lens cap problems of either holding it, losing it, or having it fly around on the lens cap cord on a windy day.<br /><br />This screw fitment on the lens was perfect and the size of the cap when screwed into the lens body gives it the same profile as the original removable lens cap.<br /><br />The only people that would not be interested are those who might want to use filters, teleconverters or other screw on lens complements.  But if I want to do that type of photography I break out the DSLR.  I use this just as a high quality point and shoot and with this lens cap that is exactly what I get.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like this game, just don't like that I have to involve other neighbors to get anywhere :o( I like to do it on my own.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|I have many Rod Stewart albums, and I didn't think  twice about ordering this one.  I think it is the best Christmas album of the year.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Love this movie and very appreciative of being able to purchase a quality copy  Same Fail Safe story in a very humerous mode acted out in superb fashion by talented actors
B00011D1OA|5.0|love love love audrey hepburn!! She was a wonderful actress, this is a must movie if you love her, this is a classic! no dislikes, I love this movie and all the extras that came on the dvd too.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I appreciated the opportunity to purchase a quality repro of this great movie.The message depicted in this story could have been a reality as the cold war was in full swing albeit unknown to most of the ordinary people.  It was a very watchable movie for that reason and thank goodness did not become reality .The follow up to it is the spoof version ,Dr Strangelove, which was very humerous and entertaining and conveyed a similiar scenario.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|got this for my husband, he had been wanting this movie. So happy we have it now. yes, it may be a corny movie but oh well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never written a review, even when books deserve them. However, I have a serious book hangover from this one. There's certain books you read that change your life in ways you'd never think possible.... this was one of those books for me.<br /><br />This book sparked so many emotions inside of me it's hard to put into words. I read it in bed, at work, in the bath, amongst other places it consumed me until I finished it. I already can't wait to read it again.<br /><br />No words I could possibly say will do this book justice. I urge everyone to PLEASE read it. Colleen had me with her other books but I fell in \\"live\\" (but definitely love) with her in this one. I was devastated when it was over!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|One of the best shows on TV!!! from Season 1 thru Season 5... this show is fantastic! However there is a lot of violence so it is not appropriate for children, not a family show. But if you like action packed, twists, turns, and great story lines, this is the show to watch!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|lots of fun,fills in the gaps nicely,just learned how to play the other day.I`m actually competing against my fellow co-workers.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Could not  put it down  Read it in two days, typical Grisham that has the story flowing ever soooooooo smooooooooooth
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I love this book and all the characters. Now it's on my Kindle so I can read it again anytime I need a &#34;Feel Good&#34;  read.
0425252868|5.0|I am an avid reader of WWII books, mainly that of the air combat over Europe.  I am not a touchy feely kind of guy.....However when reading the end of this book I found I could not stop myself from crying as I read it.  This is a wonderful book about a wonderful act of kindness over the brutal war torn skys over Germany taken at great personal risk.  It is also a wonderful insight into the war from the eyes of a German pilot. I would be willing to bet that this will be made into a movie one day.  It is just a wonderful story.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive. My fiance and I will play this game together on loud to see who will last longer before dying. It creates bonding time for the people on my life and myself. Love this game and it has amazing grafics. Full five stars
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well paced and tense.  Characters are well developed and believable. Can't believe we actually bought every episode, it was that good. Keeps you guessing and sweating.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love Downton Abbey and the 1st episode of season 3 did not disappoint.<br />Sadly, I was visiting the US when I viewed it and won't have a chance to see the rest of the season.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So honored to have read this book! I can't think of a person that wouldn't be better for having read it!
B005DOL0R0|3.0|It serves its purpose but I found it to be a little tight and hard for me to zip.<br />It may loosen over time.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|Great movie!  My 5 year old son loves it.  He even likes the songs in the movie.  He walks around the house singing it.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Since I love the earlier Bourne Trilogy, I was hesitant about this one.<br />Connecting the &#34;Legacy&#34; to the others was very well done and I<br />enjoyed this one a lot.
1466401885|5.0|I loved this book! I have read it twice already and will probably read it again! I keep looking for books like this one but I haven't found any as good. ): I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|Although I enjoyed MIB1, MIB2 was not as good and MIB3 was not very good at all.<br />The only people that that would like this are MIB franchise true fans.<br />Josh Brolin did a great job as a younger Tommy Lee Jones.
B008MM9630|4.0|very fun game. I liked it because the fairy farm is easely used. You can do a lot of things.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Having never seen or heard any other versions of Les Mis, I thoroughly enjoyed the new movie and went directly home to buy this album.<br />That being said this is a perfect Album for me. I really like these songs because I can picture the actors in my head. Yes it is a Highlight album and not the whole soundtrack, and the only thing that I notice as missing is the \\"people singing\\" song. But many previous reviewers judged this album against other Les Mis productions, which is good for a big fan of the story, but for the rest of us consumers I am content and have thoroughly enjoyed listening to these songs.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book was awesome. I  now want to read the whole series. I hope you like this book too and have a good year
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Amazing book- but utterly predictable. I would like for anybody to read this book. I loved it. One of the best.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you don't have a FB account you're definitely not in the loop.  I use it to play games and interact with family members! Great way to keep in touch with families that are long distances away!
B005KELWJY|5.0|Having previously purchased and completely satisfied with a similar Belkin folio for my Kindle keyboard, I decided to purchase the Belkin Verve Tab Folio for my new Paperwhite.  I was not disappointed!  It is the same high-quality product and serves my needs well.  Would highly recommend!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Definitely complete all the lowers room as you can get more daily credits.  Make sure you add teammates as you will need them to gift you free items.  Don't buy a lot of power ups until you have won the tourney 4 times.  Definitely buy keys
B0085KGHI6|5.0|The quality of the Chiefs DVD was poor.  It was fuzzy and the color was often off.  The other DVDs were great.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I didn't realize mt kindle came with a camera or I would not have bought this one, however it is a bit more advanced than my kindle camera but for the price you can't go wrong
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I was really happy with this disc. I rented it twice and then decided to buy it. The picture quality is great.  I became so engrossed in the movie and the natural portrayal of humans that I would often forget that I was watching animation. Also the sound is very good especially the scene where they go through a sandstorm in a small plane. But, what I really loved was the story. It was well written, logical, and very engaging. If you like Indiana Jones at all you will love Tin Tin.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Way to big! This would be more suited for the elderly or for people with BIG fingers but not for me
B00005B36H|5.0|I love Tool. They are one of my favorite bands. This is one of their best albums. But... The disc isn't mastered very well. Especially in the bass tracks. There are plenty of songs where the midrange and bass are lacking. I was rather surprised. Obviously this can be corrected with some adjustments on your stereo but there is only so much you can do when the master is &#34;OK&#34; at best. Other than that it is a great album!

B009VB97EY|1.0|Not worth the money I paid. I was really disappointed. Does not deserve a star. It is Not worth it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry Birds Space: Very nice and a lot easier  to beat the rounds. I like the fact that it's got the aim option
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I loved the look of this Kindle cover.  The straps hold it nice and snug and after a year they still hold as well as the day I bought it.  The cover is very nice, well constructed, and after a year shows very little wear.  It has protected my Kindle well; not a scratch on the surface.  I will be upgrading to the Kindle Fire 8.9 and I'm sad that they don't make this cover in the new size.  Some lucky person will get this cover with my Kindle when I sell it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Really fun title gameloft has here 4 out of 5 cuz like u would expect coins become scarce unless u are willing 2 pull your wallet out and get taken but it's overall a really good game
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Just downloaded this game and love it!! I play with family and friends. Very addicting game. Great way to stay connected to friends and family :)
B008MEM24S|5.0|The puzzles were more challenging than I thought they would be, but my four year old needed very little help from me.  She loves this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|SSSSSSSOOOOO AWSOME!!!!it saved my life when I was bored I have this game on my Pc and its really cool its better than this cause there is no lava.and missing out on some blocks.but its still good.if you don't get this then there is a problem with you.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Some parts of the story made me angry some good. I am anxious to read book 2, but will probably not use the kindle version- too costly.
B003UESJF6|5.0|This movie makes me giggle.  Both my wife and I love it.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Reliable detail of the operation. There was no speculation on what happened. However, confidentiality restricts details in certain aspects of the event.
1593157134|5.0|the best part about this book is that it is practical, clearly written, concise and too the point. It was an easy read unlike other self help books. the message really stuck with me and i have made progress using the methods outlined. Would def. recommend this book to people looking for that extra push. Goodluck!
0061339202|4.0|Let it be said that this book is written in academiceze. It is hard to read. Actually, getting through the book is an accomplishment for the layperson. &#34;Flow&#34; is for individuals who want so much to take their performance to a higher level that they will work their way through the science required. Sorry, reader. This reviewer cannot sum up this book in a couple of sentences. But at the end of the reading journey, if you pay attention, you will be wiser and better equipped for the optimal experience, whatever that may mean for you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am hooked on this, thanks everyone who told me about this. so much fun!!!! get it now!!!! bye bye
0446691437|4.0|This book makes a good gift for creative types who are stuck. I purchased it for myself and then passed it on when I became unstuck.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There's enough well earned 5 star reviews out there to convince anyone that this is a worthy read.  So all I can say is buy it and ENJOY!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The way Dr. Alexander describes the other side was very revealing to me.  However, the medical terms did not always resonate with me but I am sure anyone in the medical field would better relate to.  I understand why he had to include all of the medical records for those who could understand it all.  Still a great read.
0757302661|5.0|After reading this book it does not make sence NOT to have ur baby by hypnobirthing. I love and would recomended to the world.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|probably the easiest search engine to use I also use yahoo.com helps me stay connected to the world and be informed regarding events
B00884GR0W|5.0|Block story was the best 2 dollars I have ever spent on a game somewhat relating<br /> to  minecraft .But all I recommend is a way of playing multiplayer and and in exploring infinite item option like a little menus like instead of a  inventory a menu for items.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|FB is the best way for me to stay in touch with friends I don't see on a daily basis the screen on the kindle is the perfect size to view my FB page
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It took my wife the first two episodes of season 1 to get past some of the flesh eating, but once she got past that, we have not stopped watching.  We are almost caught up to where the series is on TV and that only took about a week.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|enjoy different levels only one thing to change would be difficulty choice for each level I see why people like thus game
B0063GORYU|5.0|really loved this. glad I gave it a try. please next time put in game ruled. it helps. thanks for a fun game.
0741470314|5.0|I'm so glad I happened upon a link on Facebook to download this wonderful book about Michael Jackson, or surely, I would have missed out. And, it was being offered that day for free. This book is a page turner, for sure. I have cried several times as Michael has leaped off of the pages as the human being he was. I am 57 years old, which means I had Michael Jackson in my life for 40 some years. His death brought me to my knees like no other celebrity. That is how ingrained he was in my life. I'm sorry I didn't pay a bit more attention to him during a lot of that time for I didn't see his demise coming. Karen has written a book so true and soulful, that you will weep when you read it. I have several books on Michael, but this one is by far the best one I've read. You can feel the LOVE in every page! Thank you again, Karen, for writing this and for the free download! Love to you!
B002B79BVO|5.0|Mad Men has brought to my attention an environment and many behaviors I had forgotten about - the way we dressed, the smoking everywhere, the treatment of women, the extrememe male chauvenist.  I'm addicted to finishing the series.
B0026PW67W|5.0|I got this product a little while ago and i love it its huge!! i didn't think it was that big and the product description is very accurate. It does not however have any of the common rooms and i don't recall seeing the Great Hall (don't take my word on that I'm not positive on that). I love the map and i totally recommend this to every harry potter fan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. On top of all the sexy love scenes and constant drama, the love felt by Eva and Gideon was insurmountable. It only took 4 days to read this book, and can't wait til the next book!!
0765325950|1.0|Unacceptable that this wasn't released as an ebook simultaneously as the hardcover. I've stopped buying physical books.  They take up space, they're harder to read on the go, and are environmentally wasteful.<br /><br />We've waited too long for this book to be told we have to wait another 4 months because we're with the times and you're not.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|We watched this movie as a family. My 3 year old son loved it!  Another offbeat hit by Tim Burton.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book with a surprise on every page, a perspective from people of different ages on an age old crime
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best book of the 50 shades of grey trilogy. Hope there is more to come! Word word word word word
B009E20IB6|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  It is not three Harry Bosch stories as suggested.  There is always a likelihood that when you expect one thing and get another you'll be disappointed.  That said, I'm a big Michael Connolly fan and read all his books, not just the Harry Bosch stories so I expected to enjoy this book.  Unfortunately, I didn't, the stories were uninspiring and did not capture my imagination whatsoever.  Indeed, 50% of the read was a preview of The Black Box, the only Harry Bosch related material and I couldn't help but feel I'd been duped into buying this book.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Great! I love love love love love love love love this book can't wait to read the second great book
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Quality games are worth every penny and this one is a steal. Astounding graphics, mysterious storyline, beautiful locations and quirky puzzles! G5 is one of the TOP game sites for the Kindle and I can only hope that others will follow their considerable lead.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game so very much it is very cool I like it because I like animals and I love to rescue them
B007N0REX6|4.0|This Is a great cd, Myles Kennedy and slash rock it out<br />So buy your copy today and jam, thanks
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;, and the app works just fine. No problems with the news feed for me. It loads just fine and I can view anything that is posted, from friends, liked pages, etc. The only problem I have is that sometimes the page will return to the top by itself after I scroll down a ways and then touch the screen. Usually, it works fine though. May just be my wireless connection, or the device working out a minor glitch. Its free, and is a good app for viewing Facebook on your tablet - at least for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. Can not say much for other tablets or devices, as the app's formatting and function may differ for different devices.

1439152802|3.0|This book is is my first and last by this author.  It began logically, but extremely slowly and took me forever to get interested frankly.  Perhaps half way through or a little longer when the actual mystery took hold it began to grab my interest.  The characters are very well done really - you like them or hate the immediately.<br />But that doesn't make up for the confusion created within the mystery.  Myself, I believe what happened only because of the ending, but when the mysterious \\"thing\\" actually happened, it seemed oddly strange the way it was written.  I had to keep going back a re-reading sections so be sure I was thinking correctly.  In any case, if you like that type of story, buy all means you'll love it.  It's not my type of mystery for sure.

0470424656|5.0|On a basic level there are two competing mental models of stock values in the financial sector. The first is that the value of something is what someone is prepared to pay for that something. In the equity market this leads to statements such as \\"the valuation of a stock is low\\" if the current market pricing of the stock is historically low compared to, for example, the estimate of the near term future earnings. The other model is based on that a company has a fundamental intrinsic value that is separate from the market pricing of its equity. This book is about both how to estimate this intrinsic value and also on how to create it.<br /><br />Out of all the books reviewed on this website Valuation is probably the one that sits on most shelves behind workstations of employees in the financial sector. The reason is that most of us have had it as a text book at university, but compared to all the other text books this one is also a handbook in corporate valuation that is used by practitioners. For those who use the concept of intrinsic value, cash flow valuation has become the standard methodology and Valuation is the standard source material. The book is mandatory reading for persons within corporate finance, venture capital and private equity who are slightly less close to the public stock market. It is less widely used by portfolio managers or sell side analysts who often look to shorter time horizons.<br /><br />There are obviously competing text books on valuation such as Damodaran on Valuation. Where professor Aswath Damodaran's writing is academic and covers more ground with regards to different aspects of securities valuation, Valuation is a practical book that connects valuation to corporate strategy and value based management. Two of the he authors of Valuation are employed by McKinsey and the main focus is on one specific method of valuation. This is a fifth edition. Over the years this book has become more and more of a practitioner's manual with consistentform, new sections on special situations and sector issues plus solutions to all kinds of practical problems in a DFC-valuation. More academic issues such as if CAPM is really a good model to use for estimating the WACC, when it has become more and more obvious that beta doesn't work, is toned down as this would only subtract from the practical value of the book. Damodaran on Valuation is written by an academic, Valuation is written by consultants for daily use by CEOs and finance professionals.<br /><br />The intrinsic value in a DCF is based on cash flows, the growth in cash flows and the risk that these future cash flows will not materialize. The cash flow in question differs; it might be dividends for stocks, coupons for bonds or after tax cash flows for businesses. The problem is that as the future is unknown the intrinsic value is unobservable. Any calculation of it is an act of faith. One strength of the DCF is that it is transparent. It requires a large number of assumptions of future performance. Each such input has a range of reasonable values and the choice of inputs can be examined and criticized. Paradoxically the construction also opens up for psychological biases. If each and one of the many inputs are tweaked in a slightly more optimistic or pessimistic direction the multiplier effect of all those small (but one by one reasonable) changes will bring huge swings in the calculated intrinsic value. The fact that a DCF could be made to show almost anything has created a mini revival for excess return valuations such as the Residual Income Model. These are close cousins to the DCF methodology, but use a) the capital base of the company and b) its ability to earn a return on capital that is higher than the cost of capital as the two main inputs. Using the capital as the base for the valuation makes it potentially less dependent on estimates of an unknowable future.<br /><br />This book is unbeatable for the practitioner who needs the tools for valuing a company or must understand how other do just that. More philosophical issues are to be sought elsewhere.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com

1467934925|5.0|This is not a review of the book that many argue is that cradle of modern macroeconomics. Instead it is a peak into the brilliant mind of J.M. Keynes the investor. One, by economists mostly forgotten, chapter of Keynes magnum opus is fully devoted to investing - and what a chapter! I will refrain from orating too much instead let the lord himself do most of the talking. The first topic is the difficult art of forecasting and the expectations of investors and how those shape the market.<br /><br />\\"It would be foolish, in forming our expectations, to attach great weight to matters which are very uncertain. It is reasonable, therefore, to be guided to a considerable degree by the facts about which we feel somewhat confident, even though they may be less decisively relevant to the issue than other facts about which our knowledge is vague and scanty.\\" [...] \\"The state of long-term expectations upon which our decisions are based, does not solely depend, therefore, on the most probable forecast we can make. It also depends on the confidence with which we make this forecast - on how highly we rate the likelihood of our best forecast turning out quite wrong.\\" [...] \\"Our knowledge of the factors which will govern the yield of an investment some years hence is usually very slight and often negligible.\\" [...] \\"In fact, those who seriously attempt to make any such estimate are often so much in the minority that their behavior does not govern the market.\\" [...] \\"In practice, we [the market practitioners] have tacitly agreed, as a rule, to fall back on what is, in truth, a convention [...] assuming that the existing state of affairs will continue indefinitely, except in so far we have specific reasons to expect a change. This does not mean that we really believe that the existing state of affairs will continue indefinitely. We know from extensive experience that this is most unlikely.\\"<br /><br />Next we turn to the animal spirits of investors, the lunacy of relative investing drawn to extremes and the results that a speculative market can have on the capital allocation of a society.<br /><br />\\"A conventional valuation which is established as the outcome of the mass psychology of a large number of ignorant individuals is liable to change violently as the result of a sudden fluctuation of opinion due to factors which do not really make much difference to the prospective yield; since there will be no strong roots of conviction to hold it steady.\\" [...] \\"They are concerned, not with what an investment is really worth to a man who buys it \\"for keeps\\", but with what the market will value it at, under the influence of mass psychology, three months or a year hence.\\" [...] \\"The actual, private object of the most skilled investment to-day is to \\"beat the gun\\", [...] to outwit the crowd, and to pass the bad, or depreciating, half-crown to the other fellow.\\" [...] \\"We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.\\" [...] \\"When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.\\"<br /><br />Finally, we let the value investor Keynes spread some cynicisms about how the environment treats his equals. Contrarianism surely is a lonely activity and requires its toll.<br /><br />\\"Investment based on genuine long-term expectation is so difficult to-day as to be scarcely practicable.\\" [...] \\"Moreover, life is not long enough; - human nature desires quick results, there is a peculiar zest in making money quickly, and remoter gains are discounted by the average man at a very high rate. The game of professional investment is intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll.\\" [...] \\"For it is in the essence of this behavior that he [thelong term investor] should be eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.\\"<br /><br />Eighteen pages of poetry.

0062071017|5.0|Cynthia Montgomery is a Professor, and former Head of the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School, where she has taught for more than 20 years. She is currently teaching strategy in the School's executive program for entrepreneurs and owners of private companies. This book is basically a brief summary of the course she teaches there. It is well worth reading. As always, when someone really understands their subject, they manage to explain complex issues in a rather simple and straightforward way. Montgomery does it far better than most, even though a dedicated student of strategy will not be surprised by the messages, nor by most of the cases like Apple, IKEA and Gucci. But Montgomery's passion is unusual - she truly believes it is \\"time to approach strategy in a different way and time to transform the process from a mechanical, analytical activity to something deeper, more meaningful and far more rewarding for the leader\\".<br /><br />Montgomery reminds me of two important issues I had almost forgotten. It's strange because it ought to be obvious to all of us. The first issue is that strategy has evolved a lot since Professor Porter's first writings. Nowadays, it is an industry with hordes of specialists and consultants advising. But strategy is not a destination - it's a journey. \\"Strategy - the system of value creation that underlies a company's competitive position and uniqueness - has to be embraced as something open, not something closed. It is a system that evolves, moves and changes\\"<br /><br />So, who is the true strategist? Many separate strategy from leadership, implying that you are either a doer or a thinker. Montgomery's message is that only the leader can be the strategist, primary because strategy is more than just diagnosis and policy; it's also about continuous adjustments of coordinated actions. The leader doesn't necessarily need to create the strategy formulation himself - often it's positive to involve the management team and consultants, but in the end it's about living with a strategy over time and \\"the richness of judgment, the continuity of purpose, the will to commit an organization to a particular path\\". If more leaders got this insight and realized they need to be the strategists - to also have a view from the balcony instead of just being firefighters - most companies would be better managed.<br /><br />The second issue is equally interesting. Montgomery begins her course by asking these entrepreneurs: \\"Does your company matter? If you closed its doors today, would your customers suffer any real loss? How long would it take, and how difficult would it be, for them to find another firm that could meet those needs as well as you did?\\" These questions surprise most entrepreneurs, and few are able to answer them directly. \\"Accustomed to describing their business by the industries they're in or the products they make, they can't articulate the specific needs their business fills, or the unique points that distinguish them from competitors on anything beyond a superficial level.\\" Leaders are so focused on competition that they have forgotten the company's purpose. Why does it exist? If the leaders aren't clear about this themselves, imagine the confusion in their businesses three levels down...<br /><br />I believe the one thing really successful companies have in common, is that every stakeholder has a genuine understanding of the company's purpose. Montgomery puts purpose in the center of the strategy wheel. A genuine purpose is ennobling, puts a stake in the ground, sets you apart and sets the stage for value creation and capture. But a great purpose is not a great strategy. \\"A great strategy is more than an inspiration, more than a dream: It's a system of value creation, a set of mutually reinforcing parts. Anchored by a compelling purpose, it tells you where a company will play, how it will play, and what it will accomplish.\\"<br /><br />There are plenty of interesting and well-supported opinions from Montgomery in this handbook for \\"operational strategists\\", e.g. on the myth of the super-manager, the industry effect, and on the Value Creation Wedge. To summarize, this book is a refreshing read for most managers and investors. It's difficult to be passionate without a \\"purpose\\"...<br /><br />This is a review by investingbythebooks.com

0471463396|5.0|Ben Graham taught value investing with David Dodd at Columbia, starting in 1928. Since then, Columbia has been the academic center for value investing. Graham and his disciples have been extremely successful, mainly because they used Graham's investment concepts. But as competition improved, Graham's rules for valuation of stocks needed updating as well. After some years in the shadow of Modern Portfolio Theory, Professor Greenwald brought back value investing teaching to Columbia in 1993. The logic is the same, but the operationalization is adapted to current standards of pricing of assets. His acknowledged course is the starting point of this book.<br /><br />We all know how to value stocks in theory - it's all about the net present value of cash flows. We need to do a lot of input - for many years. But few of us excel in forecasting. Slight changes in input variables change the value of the stock significantly. Is there a better way?<br /><br />I believe Professor Greenwald's approach is the way to go. It's based on basic capitalism, supply and demand and barriers to entry. Most companies don't have a sustainable competitive advantage and should be valued to reproduction cost. Usually reproduction cost is equivalent to earnings power value. Sometimes, with a truly good management team, earnings power value slightly exceeds reproduction cost value.  Only for companies with a true competitive advantage - usually economies of scale with either patents or some consumer captivity - are calculations of profitable growth value needed.<br /><br />These three building blocks - 1) reproduction cost value (replacement cost of net assets), 2) earnings power value (the value of a company's current earnings, properly adjusted) and 3) profitable growth value (the uncertain contribution of growth to intrinsic value) - are the core of Professor Greenwald's valuation approach. It is far easier to forecast long-term value drivers for these building blocks than to do a common DCF analysis; moreover, the outcome is easier to understand. How much do I pay for estimated growth? What is an informed industrial buyer prepared to pay for the assets?<br /><br />The authors will walk you thru all the needed adjustments to calculate the different parts of a company's intrinsic value. It's a joyful ride and there are several interesting case studies that help you understand the valuation approach better. You will never return to doing DCFs as your primary valuation approach.<br /><br />Part three of the book is about value investing in practice, with profiles of eight value gurus such as Seth Klarman, Walter and Edwin Schloss, Mario Gabelli, Glenn Greenberg etc. These pages are interesting as well, but not - surprisingly enough - up to par with Professor Greenwald's writing about valuation.<br /><br />I have read many books about security analysis and valuation. Some have been very good but none has helped me as much with practical valuation as Value Investing. The margin of safety to buy this book is enormous. This easy-to-read book is for everyone including very experienced analysts, except for those that focus on earnings surprises.<br /><br />I have read this book several times, and I believe you will too if you belong to the value investing tribe.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Although I thought the first series was better-assembled, the second was still extremely good.  Looking forward to the third, which is off to a good start.  The character development has been excellent throughout.
0060555661|5.0|When Benjamin Graham (for a further presentation see my review of his bible Security Analysis) was in his late 50's (1949) he wrote the Intelligent Investor. The purpose of this book was to present his ideas for laymen, with less of technical details and more on investment principles and investor attitudes. Warren Buffett read this book when he was 19 (today he is 80+), at that point he thought it was by far the best book about investing ever written. He still does so.<br /><br />Jason Zweig (senior editor at Forbes Magazine, Money magazine, Time etc.) first read the book in 1987, and also thought it was the best book ever and decided to update it to current (2003) standards. He has chosen a brilliant format, keeping the original, and then commenting on each chapter, making it easy to compare and contrast the history with more recent experiences, even though I think the book is worthy of more references to recent events, rather than the extreme events surrounding the tech bubble of the early 2000s.<br /><br />The first chapters discuss what can be learnt from the history of investing. Then comes chapter 8, \\"the investor and market fluctuations\\" which is one of two of Mr Buffett's top picks (I am not going to argue with him). Read that together with the final chapter \\"margin of safety\\", Mr Buffett's second pic, and then you basically don't have to read anything else. Those two chapters wrap everything up very efficiently, and everything that Graham/Buffett disciples speak about. The rest of the book, i.e 9-19 contains a lot of examples to his theories, in a much easier format than \\"Security Analysis.\\"<br /><br />The form of the book with Mr Zweig commenting can sometimes be a bit difficult, but in some cases it also makes things clearer, even though it's a bit tiresome to read about the dotcom bubble multiple times as an example. Still, Mr Zweig not only comments on each cheaper in his own parts, but also comments continuously in Mr Grahams chapters with very long notes, which gives a lot of extra value.<br /><br />The Intelligent Investor has some of the best timeless investment wisdom. Invest with margin of safety. Use the bipolar nature of Mr Market, and buy at depressed prices. The investors' interest lies in acquiring and holding securities at cheap prices. But what sounds so simple is actually difficult in practice. I think Mr Buffett sums it up best, \\"if you follow the advice in chapter 8 and 20, you will do great, but that represents more of a challenge than you might think\\".<br /><br />This book is a must read, and its basic message has been repeated over and over by a number of very successful investors. Mr Graham was a child of the depression, Mr Buffett is a child of the post WW2 bull market, each time will always have its master. Whoever will master the following decades, I am sure, still has a lot to learn from Buffett and Graham.<br /><br />On a final note - this book has a great appendix, starting with \\"the Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\\", which is a transcript of speech by Mr Buffett in 1984. With this text he wanted to show that, contrary to academic research which assumed that the market was efficient, there was a lot of money to be made using what Benjamin Grahams teached. He looks at the performance of four people who worked for the Graham-Newham Corporation 1954-1956. They were Walter Schloss, Tom Knapp (Tweedy Browne), Bill Ruane (Seqouia fund) and himself. They have all had fantastic performance.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com

1400067936|5.0|The book is written by the previously unknown trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb who with this became instantly famous. He brings the concept of the black swan to life, which now forever will be associated with him. In his second book, The Black Swan, the impact of the highly improbable, he digs further into the same idea, but I think you should stay with the original. The title of the latter book explains what it's all about.<br /><br />A philosopher meets the investing world, using his experience from investing to explain his theories about life, that's a short summary of this book. Taleb has a lot of ideas. For example the idea that modern human beings often are unaware of the existence of randomness. People tend to explain random outcomes as non-random and tend to view the world as more explainable than it really is. Therefore we look for explanations even when there are none to be found.<br /><br />The book is divided into 3 parts. Part 1 is the best. Taleb discusses impacts of `rare events' on both financial markets and on human history. Chapter 5 & Chapter 6 are among my top picks.  In part 2, Taleb discusses the survivor effect, or mistaking success based on luck for success based on skill. In part 3, Taleb talks about tricks he has developed to try and reduce his statistical reasoning and live more rational. This is the least interesting part to me.<br /><br />The book is a pleasure to read, anytime and anywhere. It holds a lot of great wisdom. In chapter 3 the author discusses how most people who are interested in financial assets tend to look at prices too often. Instead of focusing on doing research, or spending time with your family, the blackberry is always close at hand with updated quotes.<br /><br />Nassim Taleb indirectly gives a good recipe against this addiction. Assume you are a happily retired dentist and we know you will earn 15% return per annum, with a 10% standard deviation. i.e in 68% of the years you will make +-10% around 15%, and in 95% of the years between -5% and +35%. On an annual basis this means that you are profitable 93% of any given year, so if you check your performance once a year, you will be happy almost every year! However, if you narrow down the timescale to 1 day, you will have a positive result 54% of the days, and if you narrow it down to 1 minute its 50.2% of the minutes. (1 day then means 241 happy minutes and 239 unhappy minutes.) Conclusions: in the short term, you only watch the variance of the portfolio, not the return and our emotions are not designed to handle the short term. Assume you are first -5%, then +5%, net zero, you have still had a negative effect since in general we are risk averse and dislike losses more than we like gains of the same size.<br /><br />In another part of the book, called Rare Events, Taleb explains how he has made money. He has basically bet on black swans. He is a firm believer that the market systematically underprices unlikely events. He proved this in real life by making a fortune in the stock market crash in 1987, as well as in the last financial crisis. Further on he is skeptical of situations that have been very stable for a long time, as for examples various currency regimes. These are among the most prone to crash. This statement seems to hold a lot of truth, not least in the current European situation.<br /><br />If you need another reason to read the book, it was selected by Fortune as one of the 75 \\"Smartest Books of All Time.\\"<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com

0691152640|5.0|It's very rare for a book to become an instant classic, but this book made it. The reason was the subject, a great work effort and the perfect timing of the book. In 2009, when the financial crisis reached its nadir, this book seemed to give some answers on what had happened and what will happen going forward. The authors have impressive resumes. Kenneth Rogoff, formerly at FED & IMF is currently professor at Harvard and Carmen Reinhart at the National Bureau of Economic Research etc. Both of them have continued to be very important in the current debate. Not the least Mrs Reinhart, who a year ago started to talk about \\"financial repression\\", which since then has proven to be a new concept which everyone talk about. Google it!<br /><br />Reinhart and Rogoff have built a huge database, with economic data spanning over 800 years and 66 nations. The basic message from all this data is that there are remarkable similarities in today's financial crisis with experiences from other countries and nations, i.e. this time is not different. The common theme is that any excessive debt accumulation (by governments, banks, corporations or consumers) often brings great risk and is difficult to deal with as imbalances build up, as \\"everyone\\" looks like a winner. It makes government look like it is providing greater growth (than it is), inflates housing and stock prices (beyond sustainable levels), and makes banks seem more stable and profitable (than they really are). The basic problem is that large-scale debt build-ups has a lot of short term winners who all enjoy the rally but they make an economy vulnerable to crises of confidence.<br /><br />The book is divided into 6 parts, which is very helpful, since it's easy to navigate to areas which the reader wants to focus on. If I simplify a bit, part 1-4 is about how they did their research, built up the database, some theories and a lot of charts and tables. It's somewhat difficult to read because of the huge amount of data but it'svery impressive. I would like to highlight chapter 10 and chapter 12, banking crises and inflation as especially readable to better understand where we are now and what we can expect going forward. However, if you are like me, you will find the most interest in the texts about the latest financial crisis. This is discussed in chapters 13-17, and can be read as a standalone. Bottom line is that the US showed all the standard signs of a financial bubble just prior to the financial crisis.<br /><br />The book is a highly recommended read for everyone who wants to better navigate the next decade. In general people, even very senior ones, have experienced a limited number of financial crises. This book gives you an easy access, to all financial crises, with quantitative conclusions. And the authors' basic message is simple: we have been here before. On average real house prices fall 35% over 6 years, the stock market falls by 56% over 3-4 years, unemployment rate rises on average by 7 percentage points over 4 years and government debt increases by 86%. Clearly, this has been and will continue to be a problem. The authors' goal with this book is nothing less than to improve the global financial system, reduce the risk of future crises and better handle financial catastrophes as they happen. Personally I think that anyone reading this book will be much more conservative going forward. However, I highly doubt that, it will will be different in the future. Human behaviour is hard to change.<br /><br />If you need one more reason to read this book, read this. \\"I would say that her [Carmen Reinhart's] book with Ken Rogoff on debt crises and financial crises is an extraordinary piece of work.\\" - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking before the House Budget Committee (6/9/2010).<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com

0517548232|5.0|Economics has always had the nickname, \\"the dismal science\\". This has probably never been truer today. People who can explain how economics work in a simple way are rare. Henry Hazlitt is one of few. This book was first written in 1946, a time when his views were unfashionable (John Maynard Keynes was the role model at this time), and it was slightly updated in 1979 when his opinions were back in vogue. Hazlitt is a hero in libertarian circles, both in the past with friends like Ayn Rand, Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman, and right now with praise from Ron Paul and Steve Forbes. However, I don't think you have to be a libertarian or a conservative to appreciate this book. Over 1 million copies have been sold so far.<br /><br />The book's subtitle is \\"The Shortest And Surest Way To Understand Basic Economics\\" which probably is true, especially if you politically have more conservative views. The book opens strongly with part one \\"The Lesson\\", which on eight pages explains the basics, which actually is enough to read. Then that is applied on various topics like why there is no net benefit to the economy from broken windows or wars, plus several chapters on why less government is better than more.<br /><br />This must be one of the easiest books to read in the field of economics. Very simple language and complex issues are dealt with head on. They are beautifully explained. The text is a pleasure to read, and an entertaining read too, since you tend to side with the author against everyone else, who doesn't seem to understand anything.<br /><br />The battle among economists (say the Austrian school against the Keynesian), politicians (Tea Party against Obama) or countries (like Germany against PIIGS) is as fierce as it has ever been. It's been an on-going battle since the gold standard fell out of favour during the 1930's. The topics of the current debate in Europe, Japan and the US are the same. More or less government intervention, more or less/no QE etc. My favourite chapter is part three, which was added in 1979, which has the title \\"The Lesson After Thirty Years\\". His conclusion then was that politicians had learnt nothing. The policies he had warned for in 1946 had been implemented by politicians and the western world was now suffering because of that. He focused specifically on the topic of the decade, inflation. He viewed it as an effect of a big increase in government spending, big government deficits and the big increase in stock of money.<br /><br />His discussion around this problem feels very current. Despite that everything had gone against him over those 30 years, and that he concludes that the outlook is dark he manages to find some hope. That hope was that he felt that the \\"Keynesians\\" and the \\"New Dealers\\" were in retreat, and that the conservatives, libertarians and the defenders of free enterprise were more outspoken. That hope actually proved to be right, in the sense that inflation was killed. However, I highly doubt that he in his wildest dreams would have guessed what actually happened over the following decades and that he would have been very unhappy with the current situation. Still, just as in 1979, I guess he would have seen some hope in the debate.<br /><br />In part one he has even narrowed down his lesson, to one sentence \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists of tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups\\".<br /><br />Mr Hazlitt died in 1993 (98 years old). If not, I would have looked forward to an update, a chapter four - The Lesson after 64 years.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com

B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Twenty years ago, young and quitting bond trader Michael Lewis stumbled out of Salomon Brothers convinced that he had seen the peak of financial folly unwound. He was clearly wrong, but the book he wrote about his experience, Liar's Poker, launched a hugely successful writing career where Moneyball recently made a great movie. The Big Short is Lewis most important writing yet. It's one of only a handful books that ten years from now still will be important in describing the subprime crisis. It's a story so spectacular that it could be bluntly dismissed if it wasn't also all too true. Let's hope Lewis this time describes the peak of financial folly.<br /><br />Even though the reader will get a good grip of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and Credit Default Swaps (CDSs), instruments with huge market values 2006 that few of us knew existed, this is not a top down analysis. The book tells its tragicomic story by presenting a few of the characters who invested money on that the world one day would wake up from the madness. I say characters since we are not talking about the well-known investors like John Paulson, but instead a rather quirky bunch of small hedge fund managers where perhaps the oddest one is a one-eyed manager with Asperger's syndrome. All and all it wasn't more than 20 investors in total who took large positions shorting the subprime market. In the end they turned out to be the wisest persons around. We get to follow their way up to the point where the market crashes.<br /><br />One perpetual question these persons put as events unfolded was \\"who's on the other side?\\" i.e. who is betting money on that everything will just remain fine? The answer they got from the investment banks was mostly \\"Dusseldorf\\", meaning \\"dumb money\\" (pension funds etc.). IMF estimated that the total losses in the crisis was 1 trillion USD and even though Dusseldorf took some losses it turned out that the dumb money mostly were the investment banks themselves as they kept most of the opposite positions on their books. When this was realized the crisis went from a subprime one to a liquidity driven bank run that almost broke the US financial system.<br /><br />In reality however the crisis was more of a derivate crisis. CDSs were basically insurance on something neither the seller nor the buyer of the CDS had to own. That is they were speculation vehicles that something would turn out bad. Buying a CDS was like shorting a CDO (and vice versa for the seller) but as it was synthetic the instruments didn't need new loans to end customers to be created. In this way the same crappy loans could be multiplied over and over and over again. This is how subprime loans sliced up and securitized almost could destroy the world economy. The investment banks had short term financing, equity of perhaps 3 percent and the balance sheet positively stuffed with synthetic junk bonds rated triple A by the rating agencies. What were they thinking!? Well, they were not - thinking, that is.<br /><br />Anyone who's ever read a Michael Lewis book would agree that he's a very accomplished storyteller. The Big Short is no exception, it is financial wisdom of the highest literary standard. Presenting the events through the eyes of those in the center of the storm gives a new perspective. It's also obvious that Lewis is highly frustrated with the moral of the story. The thing is that not only the main characters of this book came away very rich, most of those on the other side of the trade also made tons of money. Howie Hubler at Morgan Stanley for example lost USD 9 bn on his positions (the largest ever loss on a single trade) walked away with his previous salaries untouched and since the US taxpayer bailed out the investment banks most of the responsible persons are still there as if nothing had happened. That's moral hazard for you.<br /><br />It's obvious that the investment banks believed their own lies and never understood what they actually had on their balance sheets. When you are too busy making money it's hard to find time to listen to the skeptics. Read this book and you will be wiser than that.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I am finding the book disconnected and difficult to keep my interest. Wanted to read it before seeing the moving, but think I'll skip the ending and go straight to the theater.
0465043577|5.0|Fractals. This seems to have been Benoit Mandelbrot's premier professional passion in life. A fractal has been defined as \\"a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.\\"  While fractals are a mathematical construct, they are found in nature. They are useful in medicine, soil mechanics, seismology, and market research.<br /><br />I have never been a believer in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), but after reading this book it's easy to go from having an abstract hypothesis, based from market experience, to being convinced. Mandelbrot's writing is compelling, the logic is obvious, and the graphs are truly marvelous. You just need to watch them to be certain the markets are not bell-shaped.  The basic assumptions behind EMH are shaky to say the least. Especially the assumption that price changes follow a Brownian motion - independent, stationary and normally distributed - is most clearly contradicted by the facts. And this underpins almost every tool of modern finance. We are mis-measuring risk.<br /><br />The late Benoit Mandelbrot was a modern renaissance man, making his career by going against the prevailing fashions in science. This instinct - not always popular in the scholarly world - is probably why he chose to spend the major part of his career in the IBM Research center, doing industrial research. But he also taught Economics at Harvard and Mathematical Sciences at Yale. Math was the starting point in most of his work. Some evidence of this is the Mandelbrot set, which is a particular mathematical set of points whose boundary is a distinctive and easily recognizable two-dimensional fractal shape.<br /><br />This book is a true masterpiece, well written with the assistance of former Wall Street Journal editor Richard Hudson, and leaves you feeling elated. But it's not a handbook in outperforming the markets; rather, it's a warning to be careful with risks. Thebook is divided into three parts with rather self-explanatory titles: The Old Way, The New Way and The Way Ahead. Mandelbrot handles many topics including roughness, the power of power laws, different pace of price swings, long-term dependence and the multi-fractal nature of trading time, all of which makes you feel that you are in the forefront of market research.<br /><br />My favorite chapter is called \\"Ten Heresis of Finance\\". Some conclusions: Markets are turbulent. Markets are very, very risky - more risky than the standard theories imagine. Market timing matters greatly - big gains and losses concentrate into small packages of time. Prices often leap, not glide, which adds to the risk. In markets, time is flexible. Markets in all places and ages work alike. Markets are inherently uncertain and bubbles are inevitable.<br /><br />Markets are deceptive. Forecasting prices may be perilous, but you can estimate the odds of future volatility. And finally, in financial markets, the idea of \\"value\\" has limited value. It may be easy for the experienced professionals to believe these are old truths, but I promise \\"aha\\" moments.<br /><br />I reread this book on a semi-annual basis without hesitation.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com

1451648537|3.0|We all miss Steve Jobs. He will be remembered 100 years from now, like Edison and other giants. There is a lot to admire: his passion, focus and endurance were just a few of his qualities. He was the mastermind behind some of the most important innovations during the last 30 years in the technological arena. I knew this, but my knowledge of the man behind the headlines was obviously rather poor.<br /><br />In this excellent biography, written by journalist Walter Isaacson, CEO at the Aspen Institute, we learn a lot about Steve Jobs the manager, the husband, and the friend as well. And this story is not as pretty. This book would not be as good without the strong integrity of Isaacson. Steve Jobs knew this, and that is probably why he asked Isaacson to write his biography - to give a truthful picture of his life. And that makes the book so interesting and educative for being a biography.<br /><br />Jobs lived a remarkable life. We get all the details behind the development of Mac II, Lisa and Macintosh during his first years at Apple. We learn more about the marketing skills of Jobs and his ability to create excitement for his products. We get to know the people that helped him made it all possible, like Woz in the garage. We get the story behind his departure from Apple - I now understand why he was sacked, a reasonable decision. And we get to know his participation in the movie industry thru Pixar and - of course - his successful return to Apple.<br /><br />There are lessons to learn from Jobs. After reading the book, I better understand his passion to create excellent, easy to use products. Few products can be better than many options, simplicity wins over complexity, and you can't make breakthroughs by asking customers or letting deadlines head the agenda.<br /><br />It is sad that this man, so value driven, often was rude to others, didn't respect colleagues and friends and, for many years, put himself first. Is this needed to be so successful? I hope not.<br /><br />He was complex man, filled with contradictions. But still, when I think of Steve Jobs, I think of Apple ad campaign \\"Think different\\": \\"Here's to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do\\".  Apple named 29 heroes in the campaign like Martin Luther King. I think Apple should add Steve Jobs to the list.<br /><br />This book is a pleasure to read. The language is swift and straightforward. I am impressed by the honesty behind the story - probably another thing to learn from Steve Jobs. This might be the best biography ever, together with Jenkins' Churchill. A must read.<br /><br />This is a classic must on every bottom-up equity investor's book shelf. Simply buy it.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com

0374275637|4.0|The author of this book won The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 for his prospect theory. However this book was written after that with the prospect of getting him a wider audience. He was very sceptical of whether he was going to be successful with this or not, and true to his investigative profession, he paid 10 students to criticize what he had written. They all thought it was a great book. So have most others. Some even claimed it to be one of the most important books, ever. From an EQTBooks perspective however, that is quite an exaggeration.<br /><br />Thinking fast and slow is a book on how the brain works and is made up of five parts. In the first part Kahneman claims that our brain is controlled by system 1 (fast, automatic, no effort, no sense of voluntary control) and system 2 (slow, requires concentration and effort). In the second part he gives several examples where system 1 leads to the wrong conclusions. The author discusses anchoring, availability and emotional biases and regression to the mean. Part 3 continues in the same way but focuses on the illusion of understanding. Part 4, called choices, is where Kahneman brings forward his Noble Price winning prospect theory. In the final part he becomes more philosophical, thinking about life and giving advice - such as to choose the vacation that will give you the most pleasure while it lasts, not the one that will give you the most memories.<br /><br />EQTBooks is about investing and if I simplify things, behavioural finance is the category which marries investing with psychology. Over the last years we have seen several books in this area, many which EQTBooks has reviewed. It's also a popular category among investment professionals since it's easy to relate to the psychological aspects. In today's lingo it's called sentiment, risk on/off and VIX = fear index, and it's given a lot of attention. I would argue that there are two types of books in this category - books written by people from the financial industry (Maboussin, Taleb, Montier) and books written by academics (whom tend to look at chess, poker and investing as areas where psychology plays a role). This book belongs in the latter category and since it's academic the stock market is considered efficient. This is dealt with in part three and chapters like \\"The illusion of understanding\\" and \\"The illusion of validity\\" gives you an understanding of the author's view. In general if you are not a specialist in the field you tend to know less and rely on statistics. One conclusion which relates to this is the claim regarding on golf, in which I have some insight. Kahneman claims that golfers try harder to make a par putt than a birdie putt, based on statistics. Well, I know I try harder for birdies than par putts but that doesn't mean I am more successful.<br /><br />The book has several interesting conclusions. Among my favourites are the recommendations to anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate; to question your evidence; be aware of your own biases; and slow down to let system 2 take charge more often. Even the author admits to problems in living up to the ideas of this book and gives some examples of where he was too excited about a project to care about his own biases. One concrete advice to ensure improvement in a process relates to when you are going to hire someone. Select 6 key traits, score candidates 1-5 on these. Choose the one with the highest score. Resist your wish to change the ranking based upon likeability etc., i.e. let system 2 take charge over system 1.<br /><br />If you want to know more about the psychology of investing, choose other books like those written by people in the financial industry. But read them using system 2. The awareness of the existence of the two systems is useful. That's my main take away from this book.<br /><br />This is a review by investingbythebooks.com
B004QX07G4|4.0|I'm a big fan. I really am. But I didn't love it. I wanted to, but I  didn't. There were some cute little anecdotes, but I wanted more meat. I read the entire book on a plane ride to hawaii. And honestly if I had another option I would have switched it up. The stories were cute but I kept finding myself saying &#34;but then what really happened?&#34; It wasn't awful. And again I absolutely love her. She would just begin telling real stories and instead of finishing them she would end with a joke. It's like it was close enough to a memoir for me to taste it on many attempts and them it was taken away. Maybe it's just me, but I would love to hear the same stories but with the actual endings intact.
1118273052|5.0|Some of my favourite investment reads have always been the monthly issues of publications such as Outstanding Investor's Digest and Value Investor Insight. Why? Because of the simple but brilliant idea that as a reader you feel like you are effectively eavesdropping on a conversation between two brilliant investors. By utilizing this format, you can garner a lot of knowledge about an investor, his/her philosophy and whether his/her methods and reasoning actually resonates with your own (of uttermost importance!). Market Wizards, the first in a series of now four books by Jack D. Schwager, is of course the premier book in this format, only rivalled by John Train's The Money Masters. The reason is simply that the author was able to attract some of the best investment minds in the market, some of which were notoriously attention-shy and previously had not discussed their strategies in public. What has also added to the book's legacy is the fact that the vast majority of the people interviewed in the book have continued to flourish, which rarely is the case with books about \\"contemporary famous individuals\\". As one interviewee says: \\"When I was starting out, I found biographies and interviews particularly helpful, and I would like to play a similar role in helping new traders.\\"<br /><br />Another reason for why the book has been so successful is the aspect of \\"something for everyone\\". The book is split in five parts; Futures & Currencies, Stocks, Mixed, Floor Traders and Psychology. All the interviewees are traders in either (or several) of these areas. And it makes sense to emphasize this one aspect of Market Wizards - it is a book about traders, not investors. Schwager distinguishes the two by defining a trader as a) being able to short b) mostly dealing with market directions. Naturally, this can evolve, as the example of Michael Steinhardt shows. Single-stock investing was a minor part of his fund back in 1988, but subsequent to his retirement grew to much more prominence managing his own wealth. It reminds me about the old saying \\"if you're not a socialist when you're 20 you have no heart, but if you're not a capitalist when you're 50 you have no brain.\\"<br /><br />As I alluded to above, liking or disliking certain types of investors - irrespective of their success - comes down to your personal belief-set and core values. On that token, to me the best interviews are with Michael Steinhardt (for the part of his fund that dealt with long-duration stock picking), Paul Tudor Jones (for his insights into the psychology of trading and his mental toughness) and Jim Rogers (for his value-oriented approach and great humbleness). That said, there are nuggets of wisdom in each and every interview, and it shines through that Schwager has an extensive background from professional investing himself. Market Wizards truly brings that discussion-angle to the table, not merely a pre-set list of obvious questions, resulting in obvious answers. No doubt that was part of why these people agreed to share some of their hard-earned insights in public. The interview with Paul Tudor Jones is in its own right mind-blowing in its foresightedness. I had to remind myself several times that this meeting took place in the fall of 1988, not last month... But that is another story.<br /><br />Market Wizards reinforces - no, it slams home - the psychological part of trading (investing). No matter how one slices it, there is an ocean apart between Tudor Jones and Michael Steinhardt. Had they both not been so successful upon the time of the book and so, most likely had a natural respect for each other, I am fairly sure they would have dismissed the other as a complete deadpan. But then again; being mentally strong, having a consistent strategy (\\"discipline\\" was brought up by all interviewees) and really loving what you do, might very well be more important to investment success than what type of investor you are. Personally, I certainly believe so. If you are not convinced, bring this book on your next trip and eavesdrop in on a few timeless conversations.<br /><br />This is a review by eqtbooks.com
0385344333|4.0|I ordered this book without seeing any reviews.  The same day I got it I happened to be browsing online for books anyway and found a long list of negative reviews, and I thought \\"Uh oh.\\"  But I already had it so, what the heck, I plowed in.<br /><br />The book is a good read.  If you're a Reacher fan don't be scared off by the nay-sayers.  It's true that the story unfolds more slowly, but that doesn't make it tedious.  Reacher is hitchhiking and doesn't realize at first that the car that picked him up is coming from a murder scene.  The tension builds as one thing after another catches our hero's attention and he realizes something's wrong.  There are twists and surprises and a bit of misdirection, which keeps you on your toes.<br /><br />Like most Reacher fans I like some action, and the real vigilante justice in this story doesn't occur until near the end, making the book much more cerebral than most of author Child's earlier novels.  But it moves, and it's interesting in the same way a Sherlock Holmes story is interesting: you get the clues and either you spot them or don't, but Reacher does and Child puts us in Reacher's mind as he puts the pieces of the puzzle together for us.  It is, in fact, quite well thought out.<br /><br />One review mentioned Reacher threatening a child.  That sounds pretty awful, except the way it went down it's practically a non-event.  A kid asks \\"Will I be in trouble if I don't tell?\\" and Reacher says something along the lines of \\"Yeah, kid, you could get arrested.\\"  Big deal.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 stars.  It's extremely rare that I give any fiction 5 stars ... in fact I don't recall the last time I did that ... so 4 stars is in my opinion a good read.  Buy \\"A Wanted Man\\" and enjoy.
159420411X|3.0|Nate Silver became famous due to his innovative use of statistics in baseball followed, by correctly predicting the results of 49 out of 50 states in the 2008 election (50 out of 50 in 2012). In 2008 Silver launched his website FiveThirtyEight.com. In 2009 he was named one of The World's 100 Most Influential People by Time. In 2012 FiveThirtyEight.com won an award as the Best Political Blog from the International Academy of Digital Arts. Amazon.com named The Signal and the Noise the best non-fiction book of 2012.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, each consisting of 3-4 chapters. The first part is about failures and successes of historic predictions (Silver presents his baseball predictions). The second part treats the problems of making predictions of dynamic systems like the weather. In the final parts Silver presents his statistical tool, the Bayes theorem, which he then uses to improve prediction skills (this theorem is also used by Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking Fast and Slow, i.e. this is something we all should learn more about...).<br /><br />In the third part of the book Silver applies this theorem to various examples, like sports betting and his own experience as a successful poker player. In the final part he uses Bayes on such difficult problems as terrorism, financial markets and global warming. When it comes to the latter Silver claims that there is no clear evidence of global warming. It's not possible to predict higher temperatures with certainty. Temperatures have been flat for a decade, quite the opposite of previous predictions. He is worried that neither side in the debate looks at facts and data, but instead selects noise that supports previous views. In the beautifully written introduction the dramatic increase in data, and therefore also noise, is presented as a problem just because it's easier for followers to find noise to support their views, which could be one reason why political partisanship has been increasing rapidly.<br /><br />Mr Silver has written a very entertaining book. He takes on the numerous problems with statistics and shows how to find the truth (signal) among the data (noise). My main critique of the book is that the author has few solutions. The main conclusion is that we should be less certain about our views and predictions. In his view many experts who are seen in media tend to exaggerate, oversimplify and to be careless with facts. The reason being that in order to get airtime and attention you need to say something newsworthy that can make a headline, not necessarily what is relevant. One of the few exceptions being Hans Rosling who with his long term graphs has managed to explain more things than most experts - and get attention.<br /><br />Regarding investing in stocks, Silver really doesn't have anything new to add, but he doesn't view the market as efficient. Rather his tentative conclusion is that the market is efficient 90% of the time. The main problem is that it's difficult to identify the interesting 10% (surprise...). Unfortunately Silver leaves it at that. The book however is easy to read and if you are interested in baseball, poker and the climate this is a book for you. If you have less of an interest in those subjects and more into investing, then there are better books. I highly recommend books written by people from the financial industry such as Maboussin, Taleb, and Montier.<br /><br />This is probably not the last we have heard from the very creative Nate Silver. Since he is born 1978 he has plenty of time to find more signals in the noise that we all can learn from. I will definitely read his next book.<br /><br />This is a review by investingbythebooks.com

Knowing and understanding your own love language, and the language of those around you (not just your spouse, but your parents and kids) can really make a difference in your relationships.  For example, my mom-in-law definitely speaks the language of gifts, while my parents, myself, and my husband, don't.  So while it's not normal for me to send flowers to my own mother on mother's day (a phone call is all that is desired), I make sure that my MIL is recognized with a gift for all her occasions.  Knowing these things really does make your relationships with all the people around you better.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this for my girl friend. She really enjoys having the extra space for her camera, two lenses, and other accessories.
B00498TQV8|5.0|I thought the story line was better than average. The acting was superb, my wife kept asking if those were real life people and not actors. This movie is definitely worth a look.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Definitely a great movie, we will watch it again! Suspenseful and definitely not as violent as I expected. The ending is not what I expected and the movie kept you guessing.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|It was really just an overall great book. Loved each and every character, and I can't say a bad thing about any of them. They all brought a purpose to the story, and nothing felt unimportant. I would write more but I just finished the book and its almost 5am. Oh did I mention I bought the book like 5 hours ago and haven't moved since except to use the restroom. Yep folks its that good! Don't hesitate like I did (it was eight dollars and I'm really economically aware aka cheap), just buy it :)

B00ANT6OK8|3.0|\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a grim, clinical depiction of the CIA search for Osama bin Laden. Its strongest feature is its dramatization of the Navy Seal Team 6 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. That sequence is so professionally shot it could be actual documentary footage.<br /><br />\\"Zero\\" has no real plot. Episodic scenes occur in a choppy manner, one after the other. Scenes consist of depictions of beating and water boarding of detainees in order to gather information, agents stalking a suspect in Pakistan's crowded, chaotic bazaars, terrorist bombings, assassinations and assassination attempts. There are also scenes in offices where characters stare intently at computer screens or interrogation videos, and characters yell at each other and use obscenities, as their frustrating hunt for Osama bin Laden wears them down.<br /><br />\\"Zero\\" makes no attempt to draw the viewer in with any human sentiment. Characters are given no backstory and no character arch. CIA agent Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, is the closest the film has to a main character. She reveals no affect. Her face is blank. She isn't so much robotic as inert. We know nothing about her, except that she was recruited to the CIA while in high school - we are never told what would draw the CIA to a high school student. I didn't care about this character at all. All I kept thinking was, \\"Jessica Chastain is being praised for *this* performance? Why?\\" The dullness of her performance, and the underwritten character, made it almost impossible for me to lose myself in the story, such as it was.<br /><br />Jason Clarke is very strong and charismatic as Dan, a CIA interrogator. Dan humiliates, beats, and water boards suspects, and then feeds them delicious meals of hummus and olives when they deliver. His depiction of his work as just another job - he could be playing a bus driver with the same amount and degree of expressiveness - is provocative. I wish I had gone to see a film built around his character and his performance.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed in the film. Feature films are an art form. I want them to do to me what drama can do. I want to be made to identify with a character and I want, through that identification, to learn more about life, or I want to be entertained. \\"Zero\\" did neither for me. I wasn't entertained, and my understanding and worldview were not expanded. I think the same material could have been better treated in a documentary with selective re-enactments.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" sidesteps key questions. Maya sacrificed years of her life to the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Dan risks his humanity by making his living beating and humiliating other men. Men, women and children throughout the Muslim world, and, as the film makes clear, in America's and Europe's cities, are eager to blow themselves up, as long as they can take some infidels with them. Why? The film doesn't even acknowledge that there are people out there asking the question, never mind attempting to suggest an answer.<br /><br />The film opens with audio from the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, suggesting that the war between Islam and the non-Muslim world dates from that attack. Not so. Islam increased its territory through jihad from its invention in the seventh century until September 11, 1683, at the Battle of Vienna. After that defeat, Islam stopped its spread. The significance of the date of September 11 goes back over four centuries.<br /><br />America's founding fathers had to deal with jihad; see Thomas Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates. Some argue terrorism, including the 9-11 attack, is caused by Western imperialism. The solution to these thinkers is for the Western world to be nicer to non-Western nations, to practice multiculturalism and to share the wealth. Others argue that jihad is inextricable from Islam, and that one necessary step is for the West to recognize and cherish its own unique virtues - to cherish that for which its spies, soldiers, and citizens fight, sacrifice, kill and die.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" never so much as brushes up against these questions. At its key moment, the film is hollow. We all know how the hunt ends - we all know Osama bin Laden is dead. \\"Zero\\" might have addressed why Maya gave the time of her life to that hunt, why Dan risked his humanity, why Seal Team 6 trained for years and risked their lives. \\"Zero\\" never does consider why these, who might have been the film's heroes, did what they did, and I walked out of the theater oddly unmoved by all the high tension and graphic violence I'd just sat through.es, soldiers, and citizens fight, sacrifice, kill and die.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" never so much as brushes up against these questions.

B00A81MV3U|3.0|\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a grating, occasionally endearing and humorous portrait of a bipolar misfit attempting to create a livable life after his release from a court-mandated stay in a mental institution. Pat (Bradley Cooper) chases his wife, unseen for most of the film. She has a fulltime job as a high school English teacher. Pat has no job and lives in his parents' attic. His parents, Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver (whom I thought was Sally Struthers) are themselves no prize winners. Dad is an obsessive compulsive football fan and gambler who insists that his son Pat must sit next to him during games while holding a green handkerchief in order for his team, the Philadelphia Eagles, to win. Mom cooks and whines a lot.<br /><br />Pat meets Tiffany, a very, very hot young widow. She falls in love with him at first sight, but he resists her, because he wants to get back with his wife.<br /><br />The best reason to see this film is Bradley Cooper's performance. He is terrific as a man with limited cards playing them the best way he knows how, given his limited awareness, abilities and options. Your heart aches for him. He often behaves in outrageous, indeed, illegal ways, but his insanity is an expression of real sanity in a couple of scenes. He vehemently rejects Ernest Hemingway's decisions in \\"Farewell to Arms\\" and he rescues his brother from racist thugs.<br /><br />The movie as a whole failed to take flight for me. I found the main characters to be too grating, and I needed a respite or an artistic intervention that would make their qualities more bearable. There was an opportunity for that. Tiffany is a dancer, and she and Pat train to compete in a dance contest. After lengthy, detailed scenes of ugly, irrational and loud familial manipulations, false hope, and dysfunction, I could have used some well-presented music and dance. The director doesn't take advantage of that, though, and the film just squats there, annoying the audience. The film's end is less a resolution and more of a \\"we're out of time here so let's wrap things up.\\"<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is spectacularly beautiful, and very young. She's fifteen years younger than Cooper and far too young to be convincing as a grieving widow. She is costumed in skintight leggings and bratops that emphasize her long, slim legs and considerable frontal and posterior assets. Her skin is flawless.<br /><br />I could did not, for one second, believe this vision of health and loveliness to be a desperate, medicated, marginal, screwed up, nymphomaniac widow. I believed her to be exactly what she was - eye candy positioned to keep male viewers' eyes on the screen, no less than a playboy bunny or a cheerleader. A woman closer to Cooper's age, a woman who shows the knocks that life can leave on a person (as scruffy Cooper does) would have been more believable but less commercial. Given the very commercial choice to go with a gorgeous young woman and to parade her assets in every scene, the movie seemed less true, less daring than it thinks of itself as being.a resolution and more of a \\"we're out of time here so let's wrap things up.\\"<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is spectacularly beautiful, and very young.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Easily one of the best books I've ever written. Even at it's most shallow plot line and devices, it never fails to deliver an amazing and thought-provoking story. An absolute must-read for anyone who loves the use of abstract thinking.
B001G70M6S|5.0|It worked perfectly! The film was great quality and worked well with my Polaroid 100 Land camera :) I will definitely buy this film again!

B005LAIIA8|4.0|Just wanted to make people aware that this package saves on space by stacking the Bluray 2D disc on top of the 3D disc, and the digital copy disc on top of the DVD disc.  I'd guess that we are going to see more of this.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|A very cute little idea My kids love it and always come to me and say that they won or they'll clap.
0062197266|3.0|I down loaded the e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The Author Elizabeth Haynes did a good job writing this e-book. The way the story sets up with the different time periods took me a little bit to get used to. I can see where she is going with it, and it works for the story. This turned out to be a good technique and a nice change of pace. The Author takes her time setting the scenes and building the tension and suspense into the story. The characters in the story have a rich depth to them and are interesting enough to keep you engaged. The story seems to be extreamly long to get to the point or to some action. The length between something actually happening was too long for me. The formatting of this e-book is excellent. The overall feel to the e-book is that it is put together very well. The way the story is laid out makes it easy to read and understand. I may recommend this book to a friend.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Interesting to see the development and upbringing of a naturally troubled kid, and what works as parents (and what doesn't work).  Movie-wise, not the most entertaining.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I smiled and laughed throughout the first third of the book....and cried my eyes out throughout the entire last third. Best book I have read since the Glass Castle
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The kindle this is used on is attached to pay-as-you go credit card, so damage is limited. But the issue here is that there no way within parental controls to let your kid use money he is permitted  to use, and no exceed it.  It stacks up charges you don't want.  Charges that hang like an albatross around the accounts metaphorical nrckuntil they are finally canceled 7 days later.  Fund the account before that, and they go though. No way to cancel an incomplete purchase except wait a week doing nothinh.<br /><br />According to Amazon customer service there is no option to make it so a declined charge purchase is automatically canceled.  This makes it near impossible to let a child learn how to spend on.  It is all or nothing.  I suspect if the card was a real card, then Amazon would have been happy to let the zombie purchases stack up forever.<br /><br />Now I turned off purchases fromparental controls.  But its an all or nothing thing.  There is no way to give your kid a weekly allowance and let it go until its gone.  Instead they can create obligations that persist for an idiotic period of time for this day and age of computer commerce.  They claim to have a process for accidental purchases.  But it sure doesn't seem like it.<br /><br />I'll probably have to duplicate this review at the Kindle page, but its not just a MLP app problem.  But it raised it head here first.<br /><br />This is a kid game with a monitization scheme that can not be made kid friendly.<br /><br />This makes the whole system not ready for prime time.  Definitely do not risk with a high credit limit card attached to the kindle.<br /><br />Avoid.
B006LSZECO|4.0|When I first started reading this book, I thought the wife was a vacuous victim of a husband who ignores her despite her best effort. I almost stopped reading it, and then the book began a series of shocking twists and turns that made sense of the beginning and went in directions way beyond my frame of reference. I wish the ending wasn't what it was...

0765325950|3.0|It's difficult to write anything but a five star review of this book; I wanted so badly for it to be the perfect ending to the series that I love more than any other, to be able to say that I was both satisfied and happy with the way in which everything was tied up. But I'm not. Not completely.<br /><br />***MINOR SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />I'm not sure how picky some people are about learning the ideas of what happened in the novel, or some of the more concrete content, but better to be safe than hated.<br /><br />I was dissatisfied with the ending. I realize that it is astonishingly difficult to write an ending that covers every question and that is also ~good~, but... fourteen books, and the ending was generic. I had had fears, I'm sure some of you had too, that the ending wouldn't live up to the rest of the series or what you expected of it or any other reason, but I had hoped that that was just a remote possibility. I understand that the \\"good guy\\" always beats the \\"bad guy\\", that part was obvious enough, but amongst the dozens of fantasy series out there, The Wheel of Time was supposed to be ~different~, it was supposed to make me stop and go, \\"... Amazing. I wasn't expecting anything of the sort,\\" but it didn't. I've a whole rainbow of conflicting emotions regarding the novel as a whole, but, after finishing it (apart from the obvious sadness at just having read the last book of my favorite series) I only thought \\"Is this really it? Is this all? No tricks, no aftermath, nothing to make me ~really~ think?\\" It was beyond frustrating.<br /><br />Part of my dissatisfaction, I'm sure, comes with the not necessarily loose ends that weren't tied up, but the unexplored world of the Wheel of Time. Let's face it; the place is huge. There should be almost a mind numbing amount to write about apart from the Tarmon Gaidan, and some of it was indeed brought up, ~excruciatingly~ briefly, throughout the novel, but so much is just left to waste. In the immediate text a couple examples would be the Sharan and Shai'tan. The Sharan had a description, no more than three or four sentences long, slapped on them and were then sent out to battle. The ~Sharan~. The people I've been curious about since they were first ~mentioned~. It was disappointing. The issue I held with the Dark one is the same I held with Galbatorix in Eragon; they glossed over him. The Dark One has been present since the beginning of the series. Literally from \\"The Eye of the World\\" has he been the main antagonist. That doesn't happen very often in a series, and I had an incredible amount of respect for Jordan in being able to efficiently maintain him as such. You can imagine how put out I was when he was finally introduced... and then the novel basically ended. Much too little time was spend exploring him personally as a foe, and, though this may have been by design, I found the personality he did show to be without substance.<br /><br />/end spoiler alert<br /><br />This series spanned 23 years and over 10,000 pages. Regardless of my feelings concerning the last book, it has been immortalized to me and no doubt to more than a few of you as something defining in your life. I hope that anyone that reads this does not take it as a warning to stay away from \\"A Memory of Light\\" lest they too be as... whatever I'm feeling right now as I am. Please, please, please read it and decide for yourself. Every series needs an ending, The Wheel of Time more than any, and this was adequate, if nothing else.<br /><br />I apologize if this review seemed selfish, I did not mean it sound as such, but it may. This is not an ~exact~ representation of what I felt (finding the perfect words without using those that have been much too overused is difficult), but it is close.
1611761069|4.0|The pace was slow and was more focused on the actors than the topic. Her first books were fast paced and exciting, but somewhere along the line they began to lack the spark present in the first books.  This was better than some.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is fun for any age and bro. Suggest downloading it no major investment needed to play. And ponies ponies ponies
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a fun novel game, but it is not extremely difficult.  It is fairly easy to complete all the levels offered so far, hopefully they will add some more challenging levels soon.  But all in all, it's a very fun game.  If it were a tad more of a challenge, it would definately rate 5 stars.  Cut The Rope is still much better though.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Being a huge Who fan, saw them in The Garden in NYC when Quad. came out in &#34;73, I had to get this, although I wondered if it sounded the same as Live at Leeds. It's pretty much the same set, but some of the songs sound different. Guitar playing, drumming, slightly different. Worth every penny to me.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Watched this as a kid and loved it. Watch it now and it still has that crazy, weird vibe but in a more funny way.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|Not sure who wrote the book. It could have been Tom Clancy, after all, one can't be great perpetually.<br /><br />If one bothers to collect all the adjectives the author used to describe the heroin in the book, one can find an intelligent, hard working, poise, royal, outstanding girl. Someone is too good to be on this planet. It might as well be the case, because if the same someone bothers to collect all the actions conducted by the same heroin, one will find an obtuse, back-stabbing, selfish bimbo.<br /><br />This is the heroin of modern America! A Tom Clancy heroin!? And the author blamed that China wanted to take over the world? What a joke!<br /><br />I have stopped buying Tom Clancy's book 3-4 years ago. I thought after all these time it might be a change. What a let down! I guess I shouldn't blame him. After all, he has mortgage(s) to pay, maybe a much bigger mortgage than most of us. Anyone is entitled to be a bit desperate when it comes to earning their daily bread. But ...<br /><br />Fool me once, shame on you (that was 3-4 years ago); fool me twice, shame on me (I should have gotten paid to read this crap!); I don't think Tom Clancy can fool me the 3rd time!
B000FC1LOC|1.0|If i could give it no stars at all i would. Why? Most of the characters were irritating, especially the mother, Sara. The author threw in a soap opera romance that just seemed like its only purpose was to fill more pages. Don't get me started on the wordy astrological references that made you skim past half a page. The biggest issue I have with this book - WORST ENDING EVER!

1451648537|5.0|Flawed but clever.<br /><br />Ruthless but good-hearted.<br /><br />Hated but envied.<br /><br />Great but misunderstood.<br /><br />That is what the book encompasses about the co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs.<br /><br />It tells a tale of a boy looking for understanding & a place to belong. It tells a tale of a young man who made mistakes, struggled to admit it but hopeful to repair it. It tells a tale of a genius who's passionate about work & dreamed to change the world. It tells a tale of a fallen man returned to save his own dream even if his ways are questionable. It tells a tale of a family man who lived life ordinarily though to others, it would seemed strange. And it tells a tale of an old man with hope for a better future, for his own family and the people.<br /><br />For a biography, it's quite inspiring. People who wanted to know the life & passion of the genius who changed the world should read it.

What can I say about this god-awful nightmare that hasn't already been said. It is complete bat s***. The \\"Batman\\" movie that should never have even been made.There should have just been a trilogy that ended with \\"Forever\\". Overall though,I'd still recommend this collection for the first three films.They are nice to have and it's cool to have the bonus discs with the extra bonus material too.Five stars total for Batman-Batman Forever...ZERO STARS for Batman and Robin.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I would not have read the book due to the non-disclosure agreement issue, but I saw the TV  interview of &#34;Mark&#34;  and changed my mind.  Who ever Mark is, he did an excellent job of telling a difficult story without compromising any ongoing or future operations.  I suspect the co-author was the word smith as the voice changes from time to time through out the story.  It has the ring of truth and  accuracy and is also  a definite page-turner.
B008476HBM|4.0|I had wanted to read this book for quite some time now, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to. It is a good piece, which I very much enjoyed.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|This is a great classic.  Many, many years ago when in high school, this book was approved and on the reading list.  I read it then and loved it, but had to read it again because it had been 50+ years since my high school days.  I loved it as much the second time as I did when I read it when I was just a teen.

B00AHQNHSY|2.0|Seems like a good player but one major drawback - you can't resume playback if you switch the app. It will start playing from the beginning when you come back. So unless you are watching relatively short videos, this doesn't work very well.<br /><br />VLC player works much better (and yes it can resume very nicely). You may know them for the excellent open-source desktop player (and it's free). Android version is currently in beta but works well. If you don't mind installing APK, get it at nightlies.videolan.org, and make sure to use the ARMv7-A version.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the &#34;real&#34; language of flowers.  I will use the information from the flower dictionary at the end of the book to help me plan my garden.  Now I know why I like daisies as my favorite flower.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My daughter loves all things Princess and this movie is no exception. So glad I bought it for her to enjoy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King because he is great story teller, this is the book for you.  While I have enjoyed being scared by Mr. King for years (Christine and Pet Sematery are the 'worst' for me!!!), I have loved being told a great yarn.  Shawshank, Stand by Me, Green Mile, and THIS book.  For those of us who were around on 11-22-63, this may mean a little more, but I am not so sure that that will make a difference to you younger readers.  The characters are interesting, their journeys are riveting.  A long time fan of time travel stories, I was hopeful this would be eventful.  I was not disappointed.  OMG, at $3.99 Kindle, you GOTTA do this.  Worth way more than that in $,and more importantly, well worth the TIME in your life you will invest.  You know you want to read this--DO IT!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|My daughter loves this movie as do I and my sister... but to be honest I'm not sure which of us likes it most... though I'm starting to think its my daughter!! This gets so much play time!!
0345536886|2.0|The last couple of Grisham books have been a real disappointment, but because its Grisham, I tried him again.  Predictable, slow.  None of the seat of your pants with earlier books--Firm, Pelican Brief, Rainmaker, Last Juror.  Do not waste your time (or money!) here.  I read it for free from the library, and I kind of resent the time I spent on it. Find another author, or go back to earlier books.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Having worked in the food industry for the better part of 20 yrs I simply couldn't resist buying this movie for my daughter. Its a good thing too because she simply loves this. Although she refers to it as the Rat cook since ratatouille is just too much of a tongue twister for her yet... Don't worry she'll catch on soon enough!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am a girl scout. this app helped me. you should buy this app. it is very awesome! I love this up.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|Sure wish there had been some indication that this particular edition was the Spanish edition of the movie... never got to watch it and ended up giving it to the thrift store just to get rid of it
B008XOXGCO|4.0|Saw them perform on a TV talk show and loved the song (Hall of Fame). Got the CD and like almost every track. Highly recommend this CD&#62;
B004G600A4|5.0|My 3 year old fell in love with this movie from the opening scene.... the first viewing I don't think she ever blinked because she was so entranced.... I have lost count as to the number of times she has watched this movie... I couldn't have chosen a better movie with a more appropriate heroine if I had designed the story myself. Thanks So much!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I couldn't put this book down just finished reading tonight and I'm looking forward to finding out what's going to happen in book 2
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Love the message even if its hidden from the more innocent viewers. Its gentle but impacting Very well put together and down right enjoyable. Awesome job
B0053R3J7G|5.0|I was so excited when my son asked for this one.  Mommy got to play with legos, too.  Lego, as usual, has great quality.
0071636080|5.0|Outstanding book!<br />A must read for anyone in the sales profession and or publich speaking business.<br />Full of terrific ideas and information.<br />In a word - EXCELLENT!
B009MO57H6|5.0|The way she kicked ass and  how she got her powers back and in my opinion I think There will be a 6th movie
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|enjoyed this a lot some puzzles were tough the hidden objects were ok enjoyed the plot hope these folks make a sequel
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's an addicting read, and once you finish it you'll immediately want to read the rest of them. GRRM is a master author, and the last page is just as exciting as the first page. Highly recommended for all lovers of fantasy and action novels.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love this game.  you get to hunt for animals.  build a zoo.. breed animals.  etc.  it is a good game to sit back and relax with and with a little time gives you the coins needed for purchases without having to spend real money.
0545265355|4.0|I bought this for someone so I can't comment on the content but I like the idea of hard cover books. In this age of kindles and ipads a good old fashioned book is almost a novelty, but while technology advances and makes today's hot tech outdated tomorrow this will stand the test of time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My kids all read it and told me I needed to before we watched the movie together.  Read in one day.  Fun book
B008GXHOFW|4.0|My toddler loves spiderman so when I saw it for purchase my first thought is that it may be complex and it will keep the little one engaged on a road trip. MY son had the game figured out within the first 2hrs so it is relatively easy to pay...he is a spiderman maniac
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Of all the 250 channels we have, PBS is not one of them, and we knew we were really missing something with this series.  While we normally don't buy many DVDs, the price was good, we love the show, and the proceeds go to PBS!
B003B02O7I|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was so interesting that once I started reading, I did not want to put the book down until I finished.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|These movies are great for the family and the price was excellent! I highly recommend this collection! We will watch these over and over!
B005K01VZS|3.0|This book was okay but it did not hold my interest as much as some of Mitch Albom other books
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|A good spooky flick!  I thought it had a very good story.  The angle about the poor tortured soul of the boy<br />that is the love interest of Jennifer Lawrence was very well written & acted!!  Max Thieriot is a very good actor, a<br />very excellent performance by Jennifer & Max!!  I would highly recommend this movie!
0679809015|3.0|While the book is very sturdy and the graphics are bright and engaging, this flap book is too small for little hands to manage on their own. Most toddlers would struggle to be able to lift the tiny flaps - the point of the book. I wouldn't buy this book again.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|One of my favorite movies!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|This is a really cool app, and worth goofing around with.  That being said, I'm glad that I got this for free seeing as there isn't a ton to do with it.<br /><br />As a free download, I'd recommend goofing around with this at some point.<br />As far as spending money on it . . . not so much.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I love the whole Twilight series and I loved this one also.  If you like Twilight, you'll love this!  A++++++++
B000JMLFLW|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of Pride and Prejudice, so I'll skip the book review, and just review the format.<br /><br />The move over to Kindle was pretty solid, and this is very readable both on the device and on my phone.  Considering lots of free titles have pretty exaggerated formatting errors, or in the case of the play bookstore are direct photo copies of hard copies, this was extremely readable and deserves five stars as a solid port over.
0765325950|1.0|I have bought and read every book in the WOT series on Kindle. I know this book deserves five stars, but I am hoping to add to the pressure on TOR to do the right thing and release this book in the ebook format.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not your typical zombie story. Details about such that you would never had thought of. Sometimes I would forget that it was even about zombies it was so in-depth
B008602KQI|4.0|Definitely a dvd to add to the collection...This movie was well acted, well done and one of the few that does the book justice
0062200909|5.0|More wonderful music for Middle Earth by Howard Shore.  The CDs are packaged beautifully and the extra information inside was an added bonus.
030759565X|5.0|I heard this author on NPR and was struck by her attitude about cooking.  She prepares wholesome food with a bit of a twist and the several recipes I've tried were delicious.  I really like her cucumber slaw recipe and the pumpkin cheese cake I made for Thanksgiving.
B000KIPT30|5.0|Story-We bought all new audio video equipement incuding cordless headphones because my husband is hearing challenged. The only problem was that using the headphone jack turns off the speakers and there is not an either or option. This is perfect if I'm sleeping, but when we both want to watch a show but he needs it louder than is comfortable for me it didn't work. I did some reading an checked out our Pioneer amp and it seemed that using the preout jacks in the back plugged into a small amplipher might do the trick. Enters this nifty inexpensive little amp.<br /><br />Major disappointment-plugged everything in and no sound out of the headphones packed up everything inluding the I additional set of RCA cables and an adaptor I bought at Fry's (I hate them but they're really close to work) ready to return and then decided to do some reading on my amp and play with some of the audio controls and the menu. Ah ha, sweet success!!! I found that there are some menu choices that have to  selected for sound to come out of the preouts and to 2 speakers as well as a button to push on the remote.<br /><br />A couple of things you should know:<br /><br />The input is a standard headphone jack so you will probably need a set of RCA cables and an adapter from them to the large headphone size jack to connect for this application.<br /><br />It is not going to be really loud, but it is loud enough for my husband. Our headphones have a volume control so between the control on the amp and the headphones it good. Our headphones are Zennhiesser (sp) paid about $99 for them. The sound quality to good.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|App does NOT work ... took one picture and got black screen.  No images stored, no ability to get back into the application.  Hey I know it's only 99 cents, but I WANT A REFUND!!!  Don't put this crap out there Amazon!
0765325950|5.0|I sit here contemplating exactly what to say about this book sitting next to me, finally closed after many hours, and I am not quite sure where to start.  This journey has been a long one, and at times a slowly plodding monstrosity.  I waded through the snows of Winter's Heart and safely passed through the Crossroads of Twilight, and now I have finally arrived here.  At the end of a series that has managed to completely captivate me I found myself looking up from the last sentence feeling lost.  When a person finishes such a masterpiece of literature they should feel like this, I think.  We should feel like, for a moment, the world has stopped turning and we have lost our purpose.  That is the sign of a truly majestic work of art.<br /><br />Though the characters have never been real Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson made me both love and hate them.  I have come to care deeply for them because of how real they were made by words, and when I was forced to lose so many of them I was shaken and sometimes moved to tears.  The descriptive prowess of these titans among authors left me moved at times and horrified at others.  The breakneck pacing sunk its claws into me and refused to let me go for two straight days.  The final threads were sewn perfectly into the Pattern, and though the ending of this absolutely magnificent series saddens me I also believe that it couldn't have been executed in a finer way.<br /><br />This story is one for the history books, in my opinion of course.  This isn't just a series of books.  It is an adventure.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan, for creating such a beautiful world for me and many others to fall into.  And thank you Brandon Sanderson for accepting the mantle of responsibility for finishing the legend for us.<br /><br />The Dragon will forever ride on the winds of time.
B009M588K8|5.0|I loved the book. Learning the truth instead of false reports. I love my Vets.<br /><br />I did not like the fact that I asked for a new book and received a used one. Every page was dog eared. One should always use a book mark. Next time send me what I ask for!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very interesting from the sexual standpoint with fantasies galore, but in reality no women would have put up with Grey's antics.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book every time I wanted to put it down for a break something new and exciting was happening.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The way they made the game is so amazing. I like the weapons and fairies .the graphics are so good.
1451629192|4.0|I'm sure it took a lot of courage for Jaycee Dugard to write of her ordeal.  I can only imagine the painful memories that were conjured up throughout the process of writing.  No doubt, Jaycee is not a writer, and she said as much.  But I don't think anyone read this book for its literary quality as much as its informative aspect.  This was the chance to see exactly what did happen that fateful day in 1991 and what did happen for 18 years.  As dicey as the narrative was, I still appreciated being given this glimpse.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I love all sorts of &#34;stupid&#34; humor... Anchorman, Adam Sandler movies ect. but this really wasn't anything special. Couple of chuckles not much else.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The writing could definitely be better, but I really couldn't put the book down. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Very good, not always the case on a second movie!If you liked the first one it is highly recommended! enjoy!
B00A11AN6O|3.0|have not used it. having trouble installing. have it on the kindle and it works, probably my lack of knowledge
0547884591|4.0|This book is really all about learning something new, following the rabbit trails and having fun on the way. To that end, i think the book  succeeds.<br /><br />The worst thing I could say is Tim Ferris gives a few too many plugs for products that makes me think he is not entirely objective, it feels a little more product placement that I would like,  however ultimately every celebrity chef does the same, you either care or you don't. I only care because i couldn't figure out if he was paid to endorse not.,<br /><br />As far as the cooking goes, i have two recipes under my belt and they were both delicious, easy and crowd pleasers.<br /><br />An original idea and well executed.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|this was a funny movie. i laughed so hard. the antics were great and the lizard is funny stupid. great
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So good! Had me in tears! The love strength and friendship in this been is perfect! Holding the movie won't ruin it!
B0035V35P8|5.0|another wife wants purchase. typical kung foo movie, good guy always wins and gets the good looking girl. did enjoy the movie
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I am in the early levels, and access to a few vital resources seems impossible without buying upgrades. I hope this is not an ongoing problem and i just don't understand fully. Great looking and fun interfaces.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|she plays these games constantly.  nice graphics and color. like to hear the birds scream and the pigs chuckle when she looses
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My boyfriend is VERY addicted :)  He has a hard time putting it down once he starts playing.  It is fun to hear him figure out how to master the levels.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies. i own a maccaaw and a parrot and everything was put together well. good for the kids on a rainy day
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Awesome story that included the continuation of characters lives from the last book. Love how it includes history within the characters lives.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A simply touching story about how a young girl named Dorothy tries to find her way back to Kansas after a cyclone has carried her to a far away land, with four witches ( two good, two bad) and a wizard named Oz. If you have seen the movie, still read the book, for it is much different from the movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Can't stop playing this game. Super easy to control but still difficult to get all the way through it. I Love it
B007N85POS|5.0|Kindle Fire owners finally get some love with the latest update to Angry Birds Rio. Power-ups and all come to Rio and I can't be happier. I wish I knew what makes it take so long to trickle down to us. We're made to pay more in the beginning for HD and then we're the last to get updates.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Some of my friends suggested I get this movie. Now that I have a PS3, blu-ray feature is great. Very funny.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|We used this assessment and the reports to discuss the strengths and differences on our team when we recently started a new project. It worked very well.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This case is well made and I love the orange color. Recommend this case to anyone who purchased a Kindle Fire HD
B005LAII80|5.0|The movie quickly gives you a run down of what the whole idea of Dredd's world is within the first 5 minutes of the movie. The rest is a gore fest of unrelenting carnage. For people who don't understand the source material, I can assure you that this movie stays close to it. Judge Dredd would rather die before he takes off his helmet, and his helmet is never removed the entire movie. Most big name actors would never do this (Stallone), But Karl Urban insisted it be this way. His gun is pretty amazing, which you have to see to understand. Without ruining any of the plot, this movie isn't intended to be an end of the world scenario as most action movies usually are. This is a normal day in the life of Judge Dredd, which is akin to the original Die Hard movie, if every single day was like the Nakatomi plaza incident for John McClane. This might scare some people off, as they think the stakes might not be high enough for it to warrant huge explosions and massive firefights. It delivers on both of these quite well. It really pulls no punches, and is extremely violent as it should be for an R rated movie.
B001I189MQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Batman since I first saw it on Cartoons and was the first Book I bought. Christian Bale is one of the best Batman actors to play the role.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|this was funny at times but the plot was crap. the f word isnt funny after about the 20th time. i just wasted 2 hours of my life.
B000TYWAUA|5.0|A great gore movie. The movie is fun to watch and you get to see my rock hard body on these guys.
B007EECSFA|2.0|Very confusing.  First you are in one place and then another with different character,  I was disappointed and have not finished the book.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I know others have rated this higher but I thought it was poor at best.  It relied on cheap laughs that would be funny only to someone who paid for the movie and was laughing to justify it.  Bathroom humor abounds.  The premise had promise but the screenplay did not live up to it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.  These were great books.  Couldn't put them down, I will re read both before the third comes out.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this book is just dumb.  move on.  really.  i wanna punch myself for reading it but i tought..well everyone is raving about it so ill keep reading. maybe it will get better.  nope.
074322454X|2.0|The book was readable... I mean it was worth the penny I had spent on it. It also beat going to the store and buying a new one. Although, needless to say if had not needed this book for a school book report theirs no way in hell I would ever buy a book from this seller again. Unless I am doing another book report of course.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Bought these for my daughter for Christmas.  Being a girly girl, she loves the colors.  Easy to seperate her Legos from her brothers.
B008RTE08E|5.0|For all who enjoy the music of the Beatles, this is a video editing for televison shows the 'Magical Mystery Tour'. Should be present in the library of every lover of the music of the Beatles. I recommend it.
B006H5120E|5.0|its just like being there,was even getting a bit cold now n then.hope to get many more great movies like it
B0000DJZA5|5.0|For all who enjoy the music of the Beatles, this is an important album to have the original melodies as wished to be released album 'Get Back'. I recommend it.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Excellent! Informative. Well written. Packed with lots of information about the origins of cancer treatment and the pioneers behind the research. Well worth the read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoyed the story line and always like following Harry Bosch on another adventure! This book is another hit by a great writer.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Intense, funny, sad, realistic story from the book by the Horror master Stephen King.  Language is Rough, so young children should not watch.  Very good movie
B003INBOEM|5.0|This is a must see movie at least once. You may not love it like I do but you can't help but get lost in the story.
1449410243|5.0|I sent it to my sister since she loves cats and I hate them, as a joke. She said it was very funny and enjoyed it. Now, I'll have to get a copy for myself.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|As I said about Season 1, once I got started, I couldn't get enough. It's outstandingly brilliant! Just when you think it can't get any more intense it blows you away. It makes you love and hate the main character. You don't want to like the antagonist but the story line is written so well, you can't help but like the guy.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Awesome game for kids and adults! Highly recommend when your brain needs a break from a stressful day. Download and enjoy!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I've heard about this show but never took an interest. I decided to give the first two episodes a shot and if I wasn't hooked, i'd give up. Ends up, I had Season 1 through 6 being shipped to me by a seller on ebay. It's witty, clever, surprising, unnerving and yet you can't help but want more!
B007V5CF5K|3.0|this was the first hidden object game i have played and while i did like itand would probably play other games like it, it did have a few problems. first, it takes up a lot ofspace. at first i thought i was having the dl problem others mentioned, but i found that if you leave the game and then reopen the dl starts again. there were a coulle issues with the touch interface not responding so i would have to keep tapping an area and near it till i hit the sweet spot to solve a puzzle andkeep the game going. there reallyis no plot to this game except solving the puzzles either, but ateast that is amusing. the game also seems to quit randomly and restart but luckily you return to where you were and havent lost muchprogress. however the art is very nice and from what ohher reviewerssay the hiddne object genre can bemuch better and this game is on the cheap side. so a good intro gameif u would like to try somehhing new but obs not thebest.
B004I11VZA|5.0|A friend suggested this movie for months. Off and on he'd constantly mention it.  I finally watched it and had a mini obsession over it. I watched the whole movie or my favorite scenes (particularly when Yen is kicking arse!) for three months. Sammo Hung is fantastic with his choreography! Donnie Yen is amazing at Kung Fu but his portrayal of Yip is breath taking. He incorporates his own touches to the role while conveying such a level of humbleness. Phenomenal.
B00423BDUC|5.0|I've seen this before; it's a shame it was never released on DVD in the USA as it is a good movie and has an awesome sound track.  The Region 2 vendor in Italy I purchased it from was great.  Delivery took a couple weeks (well within the time I was told), and it was packaged well.  The Region 2 DVD does NOT play in conventional DVD players.  However, it will play on a computer using VLC and likely other shareware/freeware apps.
B009E3EYMY|5.0|I have just about every Zep DVD available, and this is by far the best one ever. If they ever decide to do a tour again, I will be going. Saw them years ago on the Four Symbols tour. They are the greatest Rock Band that ever existed!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is just awesome. It's worth getting the full version for sure. I love these kind of games, and if you do too, this game is a must buy!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the Weather Channel on my kindle fire. Very quick and convenient to check local  weather conditions and forecast.
B009V3KKXY|3.0|some of the illustrations are a little hard to follow, however I have been able to accomplish some of the ones that interested me the most
034580404X|5.0|I gave amazon 5 stars on the purchase of the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy due to the fact that I put in my order on a Wednesday, and my books were here by the that Saturday. I thought that due to it getting close to the holidays, I wouldn't receive it until much later. The books were unharmed, and the box was not damaged as my other boxes normally are. I thank Amazon for a GREAT Christmas present, and hope everyone reads the trilogy.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Slow start to the book but once you get into it it is amazing.  The details and history is more than captivating.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|The person I gave this to wanted the Tinkerbell movies so it was what they wanted. What more can be said.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|It kind of has an Inception feel to it. Some good action scenes. Overall I would watch it again, good movie.
B003DT19F0|5.0|The person I gave this to wanted the Tinkerbell movies so it was what they wanted. What more can be said.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is totally the best!!! I downloaded it about an hour ago and I have been playing ever since. If there ONE app I could have on this, it would totally be this one!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Best book I have ever read. I couldn't put my kindle down until I was finished and kept finding myself lost in the book. Th poo s book is amazing.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book even faster than the fifty shades of grey books.could not put it down.I would recommend to friends
1596590688|4.0|Its a good book on strategy. Few examples are repeated over and over. But all in all, did not disappoint.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is as I said CRAZY FUN!! Jumping from trains using hover boards if I didn't have this app I would die its so much fun it's way better than temple run no offense whoever made that app but it is whoever dosnt have this app u should buy it!
B0061S073A|5.0|My husband and I had a hard time letting our little's borrow our tablets because they would get upset when they would hit a button by accident and then bring the tablets to us to fix the problem..... then we found out there were several items that were ready to be purchased and NOT to mention the ads that are NOT appropriate for young kids & have NO business being offered in ANY kids game app!!!!!!! I can't hover over my 3 & 4 year old while their playing games that is actually when I can have a little freedom and be relaxed knowing that I can start some laundry or wash dishes while they are entertained KNOWING that they won't be exposed to filth or purchase any thing on their own!!!!!  Thank you very much for this \\"Can't live without APP..... Great Job!!!!\\"
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved the book becuase it's funny and especially Valentine love.I love someone to his name is milad from harmony elementary in 5C like me I LOVE YOU MILAD!!!!!!!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I saw this at the movies and I had to buy when it came out. The story talks about how the apes are treated, but the idea speaks of how we treat everything - the world, others, the environment, ourselves.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games trilogy was by far one of the best examples of well written and engaging books I have ever read. I would recommend them to anyone, I only wish there were more!
B0057J72OG|5.0|Was skeptical when I first purchased it - Disc 1 has most of Guetta's recent mainstream hits, but Disc 2, the &#34;electronic&#34; album, is AMAZING. I highly recommend.
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|This movie, a masterful but understated portrayal of UBL's hunt-down and killing is about the most honest rendition of what it is like to work in the USG that I have ever seen -- period. The lead character is a CIA grunt who is bright, but not brilliant; a bureaucratic loner, dedicated to and living only through her work. She is one who keeps her head down and her antenna up.<br /><br />Working in a small group of Specialists without much supervision, it is the group's job to catch and kill UBL. No one else in the whole USG has this single mission assigned to them. That's it, literally: No road maps, no hardwired theories, just a small budget and blood and guts with your butt always on the line for instant results.  It is a heady cultural environment that can either drive you nuts or drive you to finding the right answers, which is what happened in this as in so many other less heralded cases. This movie reminded me of my group fighting the issue of small arms and light weapons at the United Nations.<br /><br />As this movie shows, working in the USG is a \\"contact sport\\" in which \\"loaded dice\\" are rolled daily. Any unit that comes up \\"craps\\" one time too often can and will be either shipped off to Siberia, or looking for a job the next day. It is always brutal, high-level work with low pay and even lower rewards, but when you are in the trenches, patriotic exhilaration takes over and you find yourself running on the fumes of history.<br /><br />Here in the aftermath of 911, the USG was never more highly motivated. It worked like a single mad organism. Ad Hoc groups popped up across the landscape, and a network of concerned bureaucrats from top to bottom found ways to work together. It was a no BS environment. Hunting down a single fugitive was and probably will always remain an iterative trial and error process: The best ideas, do indeed somehow finally filter their way up to the top. That is the nature of the process.<br /><br />Maya was stubborn, a common characteristic of people caught in the trenches between the proverbial \\"rock and a hard place.\\" It was not just her intuition that told her that UBL's driver was the Holy Grail to locating him. It was also the logic in every piece of data she had ever collected for her entire brief career. Only the truth comes packaged in such a configuration that there is the kind of certainty she had.  Once she \\"latched on\\" to this thread, no one was going to \\"talk her off of it.\\"<br /><br />Like a dog holding on to a bone, she did not let loose until she hit pay dirt.  After being ignored and mistreated for almost six years -- and was again being insulted in the very meeting where her efforts bore fruit. The chairman of the meeting was asked what she was doing in a high level meeting where UBL's house was displayed on a large screen? Maya finally got her revenge of sorts by answering that she was the MF who located that house on the screen? This, \\"come back,\\" will live in cinematographic history.<br /><br />I did not join the Katherine Bigelow bandwagon on the film where she landed an Academy Award, but I am fully on board this time, even though ZDT is not even one of the nominees for Best Film (go figure?)<br /><br />The torture in the movie, such as it was, not only was effective, but was also strategically sensible. It was not a case of a bunch of \\"cowboys\\" (like Abu Ghraib) out to have some fun, but dedicated CIA operatives who knew what they were looking for and were prepared to do what was needed (and nothing more) to find it. They did not succeed, but from where I sit, it was sure worth the try. If torture has to be justified, this portrayal of how it was done gets my vote, and I am profoundly against the use of torture. However, when it is announced to a prisoner : \\"that If you lie, I will hurt you,\\" the prisoner has been warned. They know the deal: All's fair in war. Ten Stars.
B009R9WAZ8|4.0|This Cd has a mix of everything which makes it fantastic! Dupstep, a mix of artists and even Ginuwine's Pony included in there, great CD.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Fun and addictive game, but it's hard to do well without paying for glu credits. Worth the download to try.
B0091LS07E|3.0|Idk y I thought this album would blow my mind like the last album Alicia made, however it is not as fulfilling. I can honestly say there are about three or four songs that i rate with 3-4 stars which are:<br /><br />De Novo Adagio (Intro)<br />Brand New Me<br />101<br />Girl on Fire<br /><br />Everything else can be skipped.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show was great last week.  Every week watcher and I was glad that I did not have to miss it.

B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|Cute monster +  Headaching Puzzle = a fun game for all you puzzle fans. I am not joking about this.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This first installment made me want to buy the 2nd book the day it was released.  Can't wait to see what happens to everyone.
B0076DELIG|4.0|First, I'm a huge Harry Bosch fan and clearly not alone. I've enjoyed some other (but not all) Connelly works (Void Moon, anyone?) but Harry is the best. I agree with some other reviewers that this isn't the best of all the Bosch books but I'm not looking for Harry to retire. What did disappoint me was the length. I read the book in record time, then went back to check the number of pages. The next download I got was an Elvis Cole by Robert Crais, which was billed with the same page count. It was very engrossing and I read at the same pace as I had \\"The Black Box\\" but in twice the time. Went back to check the text of \\"Box\\" and found it was double line spaced. Please don't tell me that Mr. Connelly is getting lazy. Because I'm looking forward to more (and maybe better) adventures from Bosch in the future.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Got these to transfer 1800 pictures to my Ipad.  Worked great, but these are pricy.  Paying for the name I guess.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|A classic,exciting nail biting finish. A must read. Definitely a five star rated book by Lee Child. Read book in record time. Wow that was good !!!
B008LY9AWG|3.0|It was okay, but not one of Connellys best! Kind of dragged on, I've read all his books, and it wasn't as good..
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My 9 year old grandson is a LEGO nut, and had complained that he didn't have enough doors and windows for some of his creations.  He loves this collection and has created some awesome things!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I have always loved their dictionaries. Downloading this app was a no-brainer. This app is convenient and handy. Everyone should have a dictionary at hand.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I love the series and this installment does not disappoint.  Lots of action and humor.  Arrived in excellent condition and ahead of schedule.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a very well done piece of science fiction. It's an imaginative world, with wonderfully drawn characters and a engrossing peek into a society built in the shambles of a destroyed world. I loved reading Wool and will be faithfully following the series as long as it runs, I recommend you do too!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|have just barely started reading this, the movie was excellent which is why I got this book hope this helps
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Looper is a movie that involves the idea of time travel. Time travel movies are either fun,exciting, or cheesy. This one is none of those. It's more suspense and drama with an unsatisfying ending. In the story Loopers act as executioners that kill people sent to the past from the future for whatever reason. The problem is that even the \\"loopers\\" fate is tied to them one day having to kill themselves off to tie loose ends. When Joe meets his future self \\"Bruce Willis\\" he escapes him and that's when the movie starts. Joe's future self is trying to kill a head boss to avoid the occurrences that take place in the future because of him. He goes to the past to find the \\"Rain Maker\\" and kill him as a child before he can become an adult and cause the chaos he brings. Sarah Conner the Rain Makers mother is a farmer and has no plans to let her son John Conner be killed by someone from the future. So she and Joe from the past plan out their moves to protect John Conner from the Terminator... I mean Bruce Willis who is going around killing people named Sarah Conner, I mean killing children that might be the rainmaker.<br /><br />Looper has its moments of action but in between is a lot of drama that takes the story in a different direction. The films ending is let down because it makes everything that happened in the 1hr30 minutes or so of this film irrelevant and that really makes you feel cheated.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This is a family favorite movie. We have watched this several times and it does not get old. The colors and picture is amazing in Blu Ray!!!!!
0399160450|5.0|A++++<br />I have not read such a long book for years. I thought Tom Clancy was done. I have been reading the Vince Flynn books and others by younger writers. It must be the synergy between Clancy and his co-author. This was highly enjoyable. Educated me about cyber-warfare. Much of which our infrastructure is highly vulnerable to. This book does not take too many flights of fancy. Much of could happen in the real world in a US-Chinese conflict. I liked the way the prime Chinese hackers were fleshed out. They are instrumental in the Chinese war effort in this book<br /><br />The old master Clancy, along with Mike Greaney, outdo the younger \\"spy\\" novelists such as Brad Thor and Vince Flynn. Show them how it is really done!!  I wonder if Greaney wrote or researched the cyber-warfare material here? The American computer experts are also well written. There is also plenty of conventional warfare and action.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is one of the best Christmas albums. I highly recommend this to any one, especially to Michael Buble fans!!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I do not like to tead romance books with no substence.  This book lacker character development.  It is a ver quick read and somewhat silly. I learned quickly why it was a free offer.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|What do like real people in life think? Because all these book the people are stupid and don't get it till after it to late is that really us ? But very good book by all means to short. Love the characters of course they both had been hurt
034580404X|5.0|Enjoyed each! Thrilling,yet relaxing! maybe not for younger readers, but more mature readers are sure to enjoy ! great writing by author!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|What impressed me the most about this film was that for all of my expectations and second-guessing, it always seemed to surprise me.  Except for the parents the boys lost, the love story wasn't a tragedy.  That was most refreshing.  That and the fact neither of the lovers dies, as I was expecting from the title and the cemetery references towards the middle of the film.<br /><br />It was a story delicately told, despite the potentially thorny subject matter.  The story could have taken dark and didactic turns, but stayed focused on the lives and love of Franciso and Thomas.  It has a bit of a fantastical quality to it, as others have described, but that didn't take away from the experience.  Nor did the concerned and fretful looks and hand-wringing from the parents.<br /><br />The chemistry shared by the younger brothers and them by the older brothers made this fantasy believable.  It's a credit to the actors and the director.<br /><br />It's a beautiful movie that elicits tears and smiles.
044042335X|1.0|I stopped reading on Chapter 2. I cannot believe that any customer service department for a bank would refuse to tell you where a deposit came from, and even ask why he needed to know. This plot element sounds like it was written by a juvenile who has never dealt with a bank, and is just forcing the action to fit the storyline. It is just too unbelievable.
1932100660|5.0|I found it very interesting and compelling. I'm glad someone took the time to do this study. It makes a world of difference on how we feed ourselves. The food industry should pay attention & read this book, too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazing, and I read it so fast because I refused to put it down. There are twists and turns throughout that never failed to surprise. This is unlike any book I've ever read - I generally hated every single character, but somehow that's what you're supposed to do.
0060555661|4.0|Livre très bien conçu (en anglais).<br />Approche macro/micro sur l'investissement en général.<br />Je le recommanderai à des amis qui souhaitent investir aux US.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|awesome app that I highly reccomend getting. it's only faults are that the ccontrols are the exact opposite of the other Hungry Shark games, so.... it takes a while to get used to. but yeah, it's an awesome app :3
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down-so many twists and turns -dragons, magic-it has everything that I love to read about.

B007STXHTM|5.0|Bought this for our grandson in Hawaii.  He has been sending us some beautiful underwater pictures.  He's only 15,  but the quality is wonderful.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I like this book becuse it teaches me more words to learn.so its a very good book and it will teach people lots more words
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|Great quality and what a great price!!! I watched and checked regularly for a good price and finally there it was. I couldn't find it in Walmart or any other store in town!!  Now all I have to do is wait and watch for season 5 to come on for the right price and I will be ordering it as well.  I'm hooked on this series!!!
159420411X|4.0|Nate Silver has achieved fame for his correct prediction of Obama's win in the recent presidential election, using a  mix of poll results, weighted by their previous accuracy and other factors. In this book he discusses techniques, such as conditional (Bayesian) probabilities to analyze topics as diverse as the weather, earthquakes, baseball, climate change, and politics. He is a brisk and genial guide, and keeps it simple but not too simple - rather in the mode of a Malcolm Gladwell, or 'Freakonomics'. Someone once said: &#34;in God we trust - everyone else bring data.&#34; Silver would agree.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Intoxicating read. I look forward to my time on the couch with this series and urge myself to slow down so it doesn't end too soon!
0385536828|3.0|This is the least gripping of spy stories, a tale of MI5 machinations in the dismal Seventies of the energy crisis, the Cold War, and the Provisional IRA in which nobody is killed and no atomic secrets are revealed. The small dramas are personal, and are weakened by the unsympathetic characters. McEwen details their faults in the big reveal at the end: Serena's &#34;loneliness...insecurity...snobbery...orthodoxy&#34;, and Tom's &#34;greed and status hunger...and vanity&#34;. The too-clever-by-half structure of the book even allows McEwen to insulate himself against accusations that he does not create a believable female character. The nasty and cynical male chauvinists of MI5 are all too believable, and the London literary scene is sprinkled with real people, but for much of the book, the plot limps and the love story is tedious. For a long-time fan, this is painful to report - particularly for one whose first job in London was contemporary with Serena's, and who knows the Lanes of Brighton and the meaner streets of Camden Town.<br /><br />Ian McEwen is brilliant and humane, but this book, like 'Solar', lacks the narrative drive his earlier work.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|Themed edgy but play was fast and easy to understand even for kids as young as 7. It is funny in a way to hear a 7 year old say the words &#34;Bang, bang bang, you are a dead zombie&#34;...lol
B009EDZ3LK|3.0|Wonderful performances by Anna Paquin and the supporting cast. Plot begins in an interesting way, but loses its way about half way through. Too many scenes that do not ring true. Great photography of NYC but lingers a little too long in places. Can't reveal why I found it unrealistic without spoiling it for others. Still worth seeing for the acting and photography.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|We are so sad that they took 24 off! Every Monday night at 24 time, we did not answer the phone, did not open the door, period! It was 24 time. I sure hope they bring it back. Action, mystique, everything all rolled up in one!
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love it, my sister will love it.<br />FORGET THE ONE AND TWO STAR REVEWS AND LISTEN TO THIS ONE!<br />it's a great game and many fun things about it!!! I think it is definitely a FIVE STAR GAME!!<br />(just like regular pac man)
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I watched a few episodes that my TIVO had decided that I might like and while I really liked the show it was apparent that I was missing something. So I went to my favorite store and searched to see if there had been previous episodes and I was thrilled to find there were 4 seasons. You will not be able to wait until you can watch the next one they are so intriguing and you are always wondering what is next. I am sure you will love these if you like a twist of Mystery, police work and love trysts.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Courageoues is an Awesome movie. Highly reccomend everyone see this! Great story and very well done. Potential father's or those who are already father's must see this film!
B003L77FYS|5.0|As I stated in the 2nd season review this show is addicting. After being glued to my tv & or my computer watching episode after episode I was indeed addicted. I then loaned the cds to my granddaughter and her husband and they are now addicted. Continual action, wondering what will happen next with both Castle's home life which includes his wacky Mom & fun loving daughter you will be laughing and wondering all at the same time.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I have read many of Sophie Kinsella's books.  I love the way she writes.  This was a funny book that kept my interest.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun &#34;girlie&#34; book to read.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I started by watching a few episodes and realized I had missed a lot in the story base and then of course went to Amazon and searched to see if there were earlier years of the program. I was thrilled to find there were 4 years before and so I ordered them all and now am waiting anxiously for the season 5 to ship. If you like mystery, stories about writers and romance you will LOVE this series!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was intrigued by this book from the first chapter.  The characters were intriguing and I loved trying to figure out all the twists and turns.  While I figured out the big one, as I'm sure most readers did, I didn't expect it pan out the way it did.  It was an emotional book that I loved.  I'm still thinking about, even though I finished it three days ago.  I was sad when this book ended because I was so attached to Sky and Holder.  Overall, an excellent book.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I have watched tons of programs over my 6 decades but this one takes the cake! I love watching these stories as I am visually impaired and cannot read mysteries which I love. Their romance is finally coming true....even though neither of them wanted to admit it. When that love bug gets you it does not matter how much they fought it Castle & Beckett finally get it together! Hooray!
141659521X|5.0|Enjoyed the book. Great story. Kind of scary knowing the same terrible things are going on over in the war zones. Liked the book's ending.  We fans know there is another book in the making. Can't wait for Vince's next book.
0345529057|5.0|My nephew wanted to read this series.  I've read the first two books, but they just couldn't keep my attention.  Also, my favorite character died in the first book which may have made me not want to finish the series.
B00275EGWY|5.0|One of the best movies ever and Jeremy Renner is just great in the leading role !! Highly recommended to anyone and everyone !!!!
B002UM5BXW|1.0|The book was a good read.  I enjoyed reading it. I recommend it to any one for these chilly nights.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I'm not too found of the game... I have minecraft and it has better graphics. I personally enjoyed the game more before it was updated.....
0767821629|3.0|This is a beautifully-made sci-fi flick that needs to be seen in widescreen format to be fully appreciated.<br /><br />It is a darkly sumptuous virtual reality tale that shifts back and forth from sometime in the near future to a magnificently-rendered cyber-recreation of 1930's Los Angeles, a visually lavish world that you can immerse yourself in. The actors all do a fine job with a good script & the story is complex and engrossing, if a tad predictable. But that's not important here because it's all so well done that you'll gladly suspend all disbelief just to keep watching. Normally I don't go for CGI movies, but this is an exception, because it's rather exceptional.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for some inexplicable reason, this DVD was released in 'full screen' format, so the entire effect is lost. It's still watchable, but why bother with this hatchet-job when you can see it elsewhere in widescreen format?<br /><br />Movie distributors who do that kind of thing should be boiled in popcorn oil.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|if you know angry birds, this is just a space app . my son wanted angry birds star wars but I didn't want to pay for it so we DL this one . it's fun
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson series. As a teacher, it keeps my fifth graders reading year after year. I also gives them wonderful background knowledge on Greek and Roman mythology. I'm always sad when we get done with the latest book, yet I can't wait for the next one to be available.
B005GPRBIS|4.0|Wilde gives us fabulous quotes and a delicious hedonistic storyline, with as always a sence of humor - pleasure to read.
B00338QENI|2.0|Way too much repetitive discussion of ownership of tissues removed and abandoned during biopsies and surgeries. The book turned out to be about the family of Henrietta Lacks. I could go on and on about why I did not enjoy this book but you could sum it up with there was not enough of a story to write a book about. The author was in a constant state of reaching for something to say.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Quick read. Story makes you care for the main characters. Enjoyed it. Cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B000I62JAK|5.0|I rented this, because frankly- I needed something funny to watch and I hadn't seen it in a while. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are hilarious :)
B005XN31LY|5.0|Love, love, love, love, LOVE IT!!!!<br /><br />I love the way it weaves together all of our favorite tales and characters in new ways.  So much fun - and family friendly, which is so hard to find these days!<br /><br />Let this show lead you and your family on a journey through the enchanted forest!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book! Had to reed after the other two books. I recommend all three books. Give all three a five star rating.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'm forty-one years old, and I have love these books.  Fun characters based in Greek and Roman mythology.  I've had a great love of these stories since I was in the 6th grade when I read a book that presented the myths as stories and not just dry boring history of the Greek people and their beliefs.<br /><br />This series is fantastic for anyone wanting to get themselves and their kids into some good clean reading.  I've seen my college students and my 10 year old nephew get revved up about this sequel!  We are all anxiously awaiting the next installment!!!
0316228532|1.0|When I read the description of the book, it held the promise of mystery and intrigue. The reality is that the political issue is uninteresting and could have been dealt with about 200 pages sooner. Only 2 characters have redeeming qualities. One died at the beginning and there were hints we wouldn't have liked him either if he were among the living. The other came to a dismal end. The rest of the people in the outwardly beautiful town were despicable. Harry Potter was filled with hope, the question of the nature of good and evil, and the conclusion is good is a choice and love is what makes it tick. Despite how it was marketed, there was so much more than children could possibly see. I expected even more from this book and got only misery and ugliness.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I tried the lite version of this initially, but, frankly the purchased version is better to get a lot more levels.  The only problem is that it can be rather maddening when you can't figure out how to solve a puzzle.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I did not get it on my phone when I made the purchase today thank you for taking my money .
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This game really reminds me of MYST.  The puzzles are sometimes complex and the graphics are pretty good...I just wish it could have lasted longer.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book in the world! It was thrilling and so romantic! The characters are amazing and I can't wait for the movie!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Took much sex, story great without so much detail of sexual encounters. Sometimes reactions of Ana too childish. Gets too tiresome to read.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have played mahjong for yrs., starting with my desk top computer. This is just like the original one I loved.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|So far I have read two books by this author and I love her style..Very good book can't wait to read the next one
0446547646|5.0|This book was hard to put down.  The plot had some twist and turns and was an interesting and good read.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|If you are into sappy love stories then I think you will love this book.... to me the characters and the plot were just too sappy to resonate
B00797MB0O|1.0|I thought with the actors in it, it had a chance to be good.  Wow, was I wrong.  The story is about a spoiled, pretty-girl alcoholic and how she still thinks everybody should love her because of her beauty.  It could have been a good story but turned into just another \\"I'm a drunk and ruined my life now I'm unhappy\\" movie.  Not one person in this movie even tells her to get sober and move on with her life.  It actually seemed as though they encouraged her to drink more.  I saw this movie just a couple of weeks ago and I don't even remember the ending.  That's how much it impressed me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game will get you addicted right away. It is very realistic and the sound effects are really good. Fun to play.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really enjoyed book 1...it takes a little teeth gritting before you let yourself get into the story, but then it's tough to put down. What made me angry was the ending -- I won't spoil it, but I remain unconvinced. Clarys mom seems untrustworthy, as is Lord Voldemort...I mean \\"Valentine.\\" Actually, every adult besides Luke seems untrustworthy and too swanky to really know SPOILER ALERT:  whose kids are whose.
B0063IH60K|2.0|i can't figure out how to win this game.  have another version on my computer that i can get some satisfaction from as i can win from time to time.  will be deleting this to make room for something else i can enjoy
B004NELBPC|5.0|I think this is a great app. It is convenient to your likes and preferences. I personally like the fact that I can look at the business section, politics, sports, and etc. first through the selected preferences.
B008M87GJK|5.0|have always loved BBC  nice to have some articles to read when i'm stuck someplace waiting for someone.  nice to know what's going on in the world
B005R4255C|5.0|He lives on in this Compulation of music that spans the ages...The flow of the remixes is a true Work of Art.

B0083ZRAJS|3.0|It was a wonderful magical book about friends and it is better than the movie and now I understand it better
1416909532|3.0|This book did not meet expectations. I had really liked the movie, and this book was a major disappointment.<br />Found many of the recommendations quite extreme, and even repetitious. Basic advice was \\"Dump him\\" over and over again.<br />I felt the book could have been more humorous too.<br />2.8stars.
B005TLYES4|5.0|The Smiths hitting full stride. I owned this on vinyl, then on tape cassette, and then again on CD. All three went away in various romantic breakups. This album perfectly encapsulates a period of time when popular music was undergoing a big change. From the terrific Peel Session versions of &#34;What Difference Does It Make&#34; and &#34;This Charming Man&#34; out through &#34;Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,&#34; and the driving &#34;You've Got Everything Now,&#34; this recording truly shows off the bands best talents. As if this weren't enough, this collection of songs also contains the very first album appearance of their finest moment: vocalist Morrissey's and guitarist Johnny Marr's pulsating, tremolo-laced masterpiece ''How Soon Is Now'' which easily contains everything good about the Smiths. HSIN may be my favorite Smiths song, and Hatful my favorite album.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I learned a lot about the life of a U.S. SEAL and what they have to go through to become one.  When a SEAL goes down it should be considered a tremendous loss to our country.
B004I744AS|5.0|I will be using this dictionary very often. I'm glad that it was free and I will be using it quite often.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Quick read and genuinely a feel good story about friendship and the angst of being a fifth grader. Taking the higher path and choosing to be kind are precepts to live by...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series enough said! I can't wait for the movies to come out! If your reserved or don't enjoy this genre of novel then need not apply! However I will read these again and again!
B009HELT3C|5.0|I love all the men in black movies l also love Will Smith very funny hope to see more soon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have written reviews of the other two novels in this series and will again say this series does not disappoint! Definitely for a mature audience, preferably in a dim room with a glass of wine and a cold shower near by!
B000002HJD|5.0|Jim Morrison is one of my favorite people on earth. This is a sort of rare album that has Jims poetry read by him with the rest of the Doors playing lightly behind the riff of Jims poetry. They are the kings of jamming while Jim riffs at concerts, and these words have so much meaning. He is a genious(literally). Beautiful album, I would've paid anything for it, but got a great deal.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was excited to see this classic PC game come to kindle format but that quickly faded when I played the game! It is slow and doesn't refresh very easily, it is hard to click on certain items and will perform the incorrect function a lot of the time!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it's cool ! It's better than the real thing I think. I almost didn't try it because I didn't like the real game, I am glad I tried it.
B004ZI0NLO|5.0|This kindle version has a lot of spelling errors and also a lot of typos, especially towards the end. Rather sloppy. The content is marvellous.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Also it was a easy read so I read it in two days. It was exactly as I expected from a Nicholas Sparks.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I'm so glad I hadn't given up on G5 after their last couple of disappointing games! Abyss: The Wraiths of Eden--What a refreshing surprise! This game didn't have that air of increasing frustration like the last two had!  If you're playing in Casual Mode, the Hints quickly restore & easily guide you. There's also a guided mini tutorial that you can choose to turn off or on at the very Start of the game. I found the mini puzzles to be just right. They were not too simplistic nor were any so difficult that I felt I needed a Walkthru or, had to Skip the game altogether.<br />I really enjoyed how the Hidden Object areas were set up. You don't just search for 12 to 25 random objects but, rather, you needed to search for a few objects, then use those objects you had found in order to find the remainder of them. This is the first time where I've encountered this type of game play in an HOG & I hope to see more of it in future games.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed in a couple of games that had been released just recently from G5. But, I've also played some incredibly awesome games from G5 that had been put out there, as well. G5 hires several different developers & developing companies & this is likely the reason why the quality of one game is so vastly different from another. This is the reason I'll continue to give each new G5-Point N Click, Hidden Object Game a try and I hope you will, too.<br /><br />**Be advised...this is NOT an entirely FULL FREE game! It is a free trial only!  Most G5 games are $4.99 and, it is in my honest opinion that THIS game is worth every penny of its asking price. However, I only paid $2.99 because I had signed up for their newsletter. If you sign up for the G5 newsletter, you too, will get 40% off your NEXT G5 game purchase.<br />(And, no...I do NOT work for G5! This is not a fake review!I'm just a wife & a mother and I like to write reviews, in the hope that they might help another in their purchasing decisions... ;-)urchasing decision...)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's an Excellent experience for children and adults. It's the best dictionary that I never have seen. Thanks you. Marta
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Yep. Addicting and I like it. Freezes on me occasionally, but at least it gives me a little bit of break.
1400067820|4.0|Full of golden nuggets of wisdom. Very worth mining through this very large tome.<br /><br />I have the most trouble with the author's worship of the ancients. He laments the passing of ancient ways. I ask, \\"well, why aren't we like that anymore, if it we were then so fundamentally better off?\\" He never addresses that question by considering the possibility of cultural evolution. Not everything old is good, nor everything new bad. Taleb's critic of some of the new is excellent. But, sometimes the critique is overdone and superficial.<br /><br />Taleb is a very entertaining curmudgeon, but borders on being to glib, too simplistic. Nonetheless, there's just too much wisdom within to dismiss this work.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|This is awesome.  The humor, singing & jamming can't be beat.  You like the movie, you'll love the soundtrack!  Highly recommended for any Tenacious D fan!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott Jurek provides a unique perspective into the world of ultra-running.  Scott is a true champion in the sport.  While I don't necessarily buy into his premise that eating vegan is necessary to his performance.  I do believe that underlying his success is a diet rich in readily absorb-able micronutrients.  I also think there may be a link between diets higher in fiber and an overall reduction in inflammation that allows higher training mileage.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This is a well written non-fiction novel.  The book is based on historical events related to the English first emigtrating to China.  I enjoyed the story as well.  It is one of my favorite books.
B007EE4XKI|3.0|I like it.<br /><br /> I would rather see Data back in Star Fleet.  Instead  of being out on his own.  Other wise it's a good storyline. I'm eager to read the next book.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Don't really know the point of this game.  It's almost impossible to knock the stupid birds down.  Why waste your time on this one?

B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Same old story but very artistic and well done! If you like art, dance and beautiful people you should watch this.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|I'd love to tell you about the features of this device, but it freezes every time I try to take a video.  You get what you pay for: not very much at all.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|This book is easy to read and understand. I lost 7 lbs on Induction alone. I will continue to read this book!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Castle Crashers with birds... this game has been done hundreds of times before, and most of them were better.  I only suggest getting this because it is free.
B005938780|4.0|While not my favorite Maiden album, I believe that there were no bad albums released by Maiden during this time period.  The optimal line up of Dickinson/Murray/Smith/Harris/McBrain put out one great album after another until Adrian Smith and then Bruce Dickinson left the band. This album has some great songs.  Aside from the more popular &#34;Wasted Years&#34; and crowd favorite, &#34;Heaven can Wait,&#34; I personally like the more obscure songs on the album, including, &#34;Deja vu,&#34; and &#34;Alexander the Great.&#34;  As a side note the artwork is some of my favorite.<br />I love the riffs and guitar work and the composition overall.  The singing is good (I am a huge Bruce fan, so I am biased).  The only reason I don't rate this album a 5 is that they were tinkering a little with their sound.  It was the mid-Eighties and they added in some extra Bass Synth and Chorus effect to the guitars.  Otherwise...Solid.  Maiden.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It does what it was built to do, but not much else.  better off just googling your local weather channel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|took me awhile to get into the first book, but I was hooked after reading half of it. bought the other 2 before I even finished the first one. Can't imagine the movie being anthing like the books.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|parents beware if you are downloading this for your kids teenagers go on here and ruin it they use bad language and talk about some stuff kids shouldn't hear. So maybe if your a kid try a different bongo game without a chatting section and there's no way to get rid of it. To buffalo studios nice try censoring the words out but teenagers will always find a way around it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series, and while the loss of a few beloved characters was disappointing, it was necessary for the book to remain realistic.
0312330537|5.0|I've read quite a few novels, but this one stands out in a class of it's own. I will never forget this book. It has a plethora of new vocabulary for my pleasure, educating me while telling a fantastic love story. Each character is distinct and unique, and described in such a vivid way that they become real in your mind's eye. Roberts has a beautiful way of describing his characters. Don't let the thickness of the book scare you--each page is just as enjoyable as the last. I have probably close to 50 pages marked for quotes I am going to take down... So many golden, one lined, intelligible excerpts in this book. Absolutely beautiful.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|The movie is real, raw, and it shows Batman and I've never seen him before.  After watching Part 1 last year, I didn't think Part 2 could get any better; I was wrong.
B0091LS07E|2.0|Guess I thought my wife would like it.....she didn't and neither did I.  All the hype and none of the substance.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|This is one of my favorite films by Almodovar; not to mention Penelope Cruz does an amazing job acting (not surprising at all).  The plot is truly heartfelt and makes for a great movie to watch with close friends and family.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Started with and maintained a good pace of a hero's origin story.  Some interesting writing decisions in terms of living arrangements, but overall a solid, fun, and compelling product.  A good incorporation of villains throughout.  Perhaps my favorite part of the story that is executed VERY well is the time spent on the island.  Looking forward to season two!
B000W25JUW|5.0|One of the best live lps ever, This band touches on jazz, blues, and hard rock with a lot of taste.  &#34;Tied to the whipping post.....&#34; gives one the chills.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Got my Kindle Fire for Christmas and this was one of the first games I downloaded. I've enjoyed it. The touch screen makes the game go a little faster since tapping the card(s) you want to move, moves them, though not always to the place you had in mind.
B000SEI230|5.0|What a beautiful story. It had me crying and left feeling inspired. Nicholas has truly been blessed with the gift of writing. So amazing.
145210655X|4.0|Just what I hoped it would be...A gift for all the &#34;Star Wars&#34; dads in the family that I'm sure they will enjoy.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|***** Spoiler Alert**********<br /><br />4 1/2 stars- a great film<br /><br />Having read many of the more famous movie critics pick this film apart, I still had a great desire to see this film. The subject matter and actors made this a must see for the 2012 film season in my book. The first problem was the limited amount of theaters showing the film. I actually had to wait for it to show up at a discount theater, which is where I viewed the film today. The long wait and the negative reviews were all brushed aside as I saw Alfred Hitchcock before my eyes- courtesy of Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />Hopkins no doubt, spent endless hours learning how to speak and act like Mr. Hitchcock. It wasn't just his voice that comes across as authentic, its also some of his poses and glances. I had even heard some rumblings about the choice of Hopkins to play the famous director. There is no doubt that this selection was the right one. Its easy to try and find problems with someone who is portraying an icon. But make no mistake Hopkin's delivers in his best role in recent memory.<br /><br />Many of us grew up watching Hitch on his tv program reruns. As a nice touch in the film it starts and ends like one of his television shows- with Hitchcock's classic comments about what we are going to see and what we have just witnessed. The film shows us the behind the scenes making of Psycho and all that went right and wrong in the process. What to do when Paramount doesn't want to finance your new film? A disgruntled actress at the end of her contract has to co-exist with Mr.Hitchock. There are problems with the Hitchcock marriage. Many things are going on and yet, Hitchcock with the help of Alma (Hellen Mirren)pull things together their way.<br /><br />Hellen Mirren  is incredible as Mrs.Hitchock- Alma. She should be up for an oscar and would deserve the victory if it comes here way. Having to deal with the demands of being married to the most famous director in the world and having her owndreams weighs on her mind. She strives to find a balance between the two. And its her help that was the extra push for many of Hitchcock's films. One of the best scenes in the film is when Mirren tells Hitchock how it is in a frustrated outburst. It lasts for several moments as Alfred stands and stares without a word to say. One of those signature scenes that you will always remember an actor/actress for. And this was Mirren's moment.<br /><br />Not to be forgotten are some of the supporting actors/actresses. Scarlet Johannson plays Janet Leigh very effectively. And she delivers on another great moment and one of films great scenes- the shower scene of Psycho. I don't know if it was rehearsed many times or on one take, but it was really well done. Vera Miles was played by Jessica Beil. Although she didn't have a lot of scenes, she was good as the actress who disappointed Hitchcock for having a family, when Hitch wanted to make her a star.<br /><br />So I would suggest watching the film with an open mind. Especially if you have read some of the reviews that I did.  If you are a Hitchcock fan this is a no-brainer. You will love the behind the scenes take on Mr.Hitchcock and his wife. And just how many drinks did he have during the film? The best scene in the film for me is almost at the very end. When the crowd is watching his finished masterpiece. He listens outside the door and conducts the screams like the maestro that he was. Enjoy
0765325950|5.0|Could people please not tarnish this book by voting 1 star just because of no e-book?  It's Jordan's work coming to fruition and we have this petty voting because, gasp, you have to wait a few months because a business is trying to succeed?  This isn't a review for the book, but I sure hope people read it and stop the asinine voting.  Respect Jordan!  Vote for the story if you've read it, please!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky and Holder are characters full of the innocence you once had as a child. Reading about them going through life and growing together through all they went through was beautiful and sad and I lived it all...
B005XLN97M|3.0|Great shopping experience never had to stand in line for purchase .fast delivety.fun product the girls  ages 9 years old love it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like playing Solitaire but the ads are annoying! There are times that I want to remove it but I do like playing it.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Skip it. The premise that the same person can exist twice in the same time was too difficult for me to accept. I understand that the movie is science fiction but this goes too far.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Entertaining and full of twists and turns, vivid characters and interesting story lines. If you like Lord of the Rings or the Tudors, you'll love this show.
B0018AJNH2|4.0|It's a descent movie.  The acting left a little to be desired.  The storyline and ideas on who is behind the early versions of the Cubes.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|ok what can i say.. it's friggin Star Trek.. Its fast paced, action packed and really fills in some of the holes left in the original series, by connecting some of the stuff together that we always wondered about.  Warp speed...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book that is written in a style easy to read.  This country needs more young men like Chris Kyle!
B000I8COBW|5.0|This awesome sequel to the Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 lives up the to hype of its former cult classic predecessors.  Witty, funny and utterly enjoyable to any one that likes cult classic horror movies, and with a little bonus of Medevil  humor thrown in,  it just doesn't get any better than this.  I recommend all 3 in the series.  Platu verada niktoutie..  I said your D*mn words... Mostly!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|One of my absolute favorite movies ever! I don't think you could ever watch this movie too much or get bored with it!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this..  Best Graphic Novels ever!  I highly recommend this to any avid reader that enjoys a good Horror/doomsday story.  They can copy the content ideas, but they will never out do it.  5 stars plus in my opinion.
B00138KN0A|5.0|Al Kooper and Michael Bloomfield were outstanding on their own, with other groups, and especially when they played together, as they did on this recording as well as on the live sessions at Bill Graham's Fillmore. Each was accomplished on keyboards as well as guitar, a fact that I only learned recently - and that may explain the brilliant chemistry on display here, as each artist seems to feel the next phrase the other will play. Although the studio cuts here lack the spontaneous genius you hear in the live sessions, Albert's Shuffle is still one of the finest blues instrumentals ever recorded (I'll have to add that it's got stiff competition from another one on this album, \\"Really\\". Yeah, as in, really smokes!). His Holy Modal Majesty shows a completely different musical approach for their instruments (a variation of this one is repeated at one of the Fillmore sessions).<br /><br />I like raw, nasty blues too, but well, this isn't quite it - Fathers And Sons would fill that bill. That said, if you like stinging, mind-blowing, unforgettable guitar and powerful virtuoso keyboard work, you won't find anything better.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This would be a great game if energy and diamonds would be easier to earn. I refuse to spend money to play a game and so I find this one frustrating.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Definitely a page turner.<br />I couldn't put the book down and I finished the book in like three days. Insert few extra words here
B000002GBD|5.0|Every true rocker must have Hair of The Dog by Nazareth.  One of the best albums ever made!  Rock on!  Even my 15 year old daughter just fell in love with the album.  Who wouldn't though.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|It was just okay. Hard to understand in spots due to the style of  writing.  It also ended too abruptly.  Long John Silver was too main a character for him to have an ending the way he did.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|I like the Toy Story movies for my daughter because I want her to learn that she needs to take care of her toys. Growing up, I was not fortunate to have many toys. But the ones I had were taken care of until I got old enough to pass them down to my younger brothers or cousins. The same cannot be said for today's generation.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Insightful and easy to understand. This book provides a clear message but still places the power of wisdom and change  within the individual. The changes I've personally experienced in practicing the four agreements in every moment have coincidently caused family and friends to also take notice and ask &#34;What is so different about you?&#34;  I highly recommend this book to everyone in which I have the opportunity to do so.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A wonderful journey that makes the reader search their heart and make decisions about living to your fullest potential and sharing love when it is not easy.  I loved the \\"Brit dialect\\" and found it added to the endearing characters.  The personalities of the characters are beautifully developed and I found myself feeling like they were friends.<br />DO NOT MISS THIS WONDERFUL JOURNEY.
B005HSL626|5.0|Having played on a big screen TV, I wasn't sure I would like it as much. No worries. It is just as addicting and great for the grandson when we need something to keep us entertained in a pinch!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book!!!! It definitely left me wanting more. I can't wait to read the 3rd book! May needs to get here quick!!!!
B009O2XY12|3.0|The app itself is fun and challenging, but I don't like the face that it requires energry to run each level.. you can only go so far and then you have to stop and either buy more energy or wait for power t build up... this is just something to sink money into
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It shows you all of the definitions of the book.  Any word that you are looking for, they have it. So if you don't have this book, you need to go out and get it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I can't get enoug of this game... I love the little dude.. his is so cute and the puzzles are challenging... I LOVE IT!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is one of the best books I've read in quite some time. The author is brave enough to cover a scary subject, and sensitive enough to do it well. The characters are so real! I laughed and cried and couldn't stop reading til the end. My only disappointment was that I didn't want it to end!
B005HSL626|5.0|It's hours of fun. Nothing like killing harmless fruit flying around.. would suggest this for anyone with children. My son can cut up a LOT of fruit in one sitting.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|First chapter fascinating, fabulous.  Second, etc., became less so to the point of tedium.  To get at the theme of -- what? -- reincarnation, it was just getting less and less interesting.  I stuck it out to the end, waded through the coincidences, but the rambling nature of it became a slog.  And yet, spots of brilliant writing kept popping up.  My three stars are an average of<br />A and F.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is surprisingly challenging... you wouldn't think drawling lines would be fun, but it's a great time to do again and again... and there are enough levels so when you finish them, you don't remember how to do the first ones... my son even loves this on
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  The idea of ninja skiers is a bit goofy, but the game play was quite fun.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This app has kept my son solving problems for hours. He loves Prerry and can work through most of the levels but himself... I have finished it and keep going back... Love it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|will order again from this seller was very good shape as stated, very fast shipping, price was right, seller stayed in contact
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I really like this one.. it's challenging and a good way to waiste time.. I would deffinitly recommend this one
B0013F1D02|5.0|Adventure, romance (endless love), fantasy, comedy, a little mild horror, great ensemble acting, and Robert DeNiro like you have never seen him before. What more could you possibly want. In the theater people applauded and I overheard from all around me...\\"I've got to bring my (son/daughter/friends/parents/grandparents/etc) to see this movie. They'll love it.\\"
B00881VLCE|4.0|It's puzzles. Not much to say. Sometimes it's hard to pick up the peice you want, but that is due to the size of the screen, but otherwise, is good
B009DTI3FS|4.0|Singing was of course great acting tremendous take off one star for the following the rent like costumes just didn't work for me . And the toymaker flying around the stage like radarman was just plain silly
B00992CF6W|1.0|minecraft is fun on the xbox and computer but for seven dollars on a device and no updates period this deal rips you of of your money don't buy this app buy minecraft on the computer or on the xbox
0307749347|5.0|I enjoyed this audio tape very much!  I listened to it often and felt it was very positive and uplifting!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is at it again. Connelly is one of the best authors on the market today. Can't wait for the next one.
1419703692|5.0|I'm giving this product 5 stars and the rating is based on the book itself. Amazing book with some cool in-depth photographs and information within it. It's definitely a must for Batman fans, especially those that are fans of the universe Christopher Nolan created.<br />Now to the seller I bought this from, greatbookdeals. They had one of the cheaper prices, however, the book came in damaged and the box completely torn open on one corner, as in from top to bottom with packing peanuts coming out. I observed the size of the box that the book was shipped in and it was the exact size of the book, which means the book was frayed and torn on a couple of corners. I'd figure with a book like this, they would put it in a box bigger and pack it with more sufficient material like what Amazon does with the air packs for products they sell themselves. Also, they didn't post to my account that it had shipped at all so a week later I'm still thinking that they didn't ship it and provided zero tracking information.<br />Once again, awesome book and a must for any fans but I want to warn potential customers that the seller I chose was definitely the wrong one. Go with someone else!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is very addictive and fun. I love to draw things and see if my friend gets what it is and to guess things. Highly recommended
B006LSZECO|1.0|Gone Girl contains way too much offensive language, sexual details and violence. Our book club decided not to have it for our next read because it gave some of our reviewers nightmares!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a game in which you do not lose interest.  I get lost playing.  It is easy to lose track of time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|There are really good games but this is the best I have played so far it is really fun I just really like the concept of the game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My 1st Nicholas Sparks book, and I couldn't stop reading because there was never a dull moment! Can't wait to read more of his books. Loved it!
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|Not my normal type of music but I loved the whole CD I hope they stick around and have success.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|This was a strange book that I enjoyed, but felt at odds with. I feel that the character relationship development was lacking at times. I am already reading the second installment and I am not enjoying it as much, but I will still push through and finish the series. The best way to describe this series for people who READ A LOT is to say that I would not read it again and I wouldn't care if it was on my shelf. It is not one of those books you revisit over and over. Books I would categorized as this would be Vampire Academy, The Immoral Rules and The Experiment in Terror series (later books in the series). I am one of those people who keep books I love on the shelf (and sometimes my kindle) and books that are mediocre on my kindle or exchanged at the used book store for a new read.    This series is a fun read with a hint of beastiality in the beginning, but it is enjoyable. Grace isn't very easy for me to relate to. It never feels as if anything monumental happening in this book... even though there are. I was never on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen. There were never any of those \\"Oh S***\\" moments when you are so surprised or overwhelmed and excited about what the author wrote. For me to love a book, I need my \\"Oh S***\\" moments so when I am reading in public people stare at me like I am someone to be avoided... that way they don't interrupt my reading!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love the show and that is why I ordered it to catch up on what I have missed. But for me he is not the show she is!

B009Y6X65C|5.0|This compilation of Joe is amazing! The vocals are spot on, and guitar rifts are tremendous! Great lyrics as well. If you enjoy JB or love electric rock and blues then I suggest this one! You won't be dissappointed.  I can't believe I only recently discovered it. This is one that should be heard...LOUD!!!!!!  Awesome stuff!!!!!!
B0043WDK2G|4.0|I love the show and that is why I ordered it to catch up on what I have missed. But for me he is not the show she is!

B003TH14H4|4.0|I love the show and that is why I ordered it to catch up on what I have missed. But for me he is not the show she is!
B00001W9G0|4.0|Please don't take my man card away for watching this movie.  But the story line is great and is a good timeline piece.  I could relate to the characters. I like the way Babs portrayed her commie self.  I normally can't stand love and drama, but in this movie love was the thing that brought the characters together and tore them apart.  I thought the writers were very clever on how they showed a very passionate driven compulsive relationship with a guy who lives for the moment and everything comes easy.  Plus I know what it feels like to be in love with the perfect person but to be just not good looking enough, or rich enough, or doesn't come from the right family.  Ok maybe you should take my man card...
B00846REIS|5.0|My friends told me about this book...Talk about high energy couldn't put it down..this couple just keeps you hypnotized from the very first page...loved it.!!!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a big fan of the TV series.  The read is fantastic, it follow the story line of the TV series with certain minor twist.  So far the book is not as bawdy as the show, but is more insightful to the characters.  The best thing about the book is, it would be a good read even if you are not familiar with the show. The TV show with putting a face to all the characters, but the book dedicates chapters to the different folks to help with the confusion.  I am about 1/2 way through the book, and I cannot wait for every opportunity to read it.  Am real page turner.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I loved the alternate chapters of parallel stories of two women and their families. I couldn't wait to see how their lives would become intertwined.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|I am so proud of the film's rendition of this now classic musical. The soundtrack is wonderful. This \\"Highlights\\" album is a great hold-over for the director's cut album that will coincide with the director's cut Blu-ray/DVD release. As fans of the musical know, two songs were left out of the film, and many of the songs that remained in-tack were shortened; some scenes were even altered but its alright. In my opinion, the changes work with the way the film unfolds. The director's cut soundtrack will have all the songs, and in unabridged form. I would buy this highlights cd to keep you waiting for the full thing. This music is so big and emotional.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, the whole time I couldn't put it down because I had to know who committed the murders. I had a hunch a few time but was wrong so I knew I had to keep reading. Can't wait to read the rest of her books. I reading Gone girl and Sharp Objects next!
