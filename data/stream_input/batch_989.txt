B0039UTDFG|1.0|What an absolute dismal failure this landmark series turned out to be (In the US). As a big fan of Planet Earth among many other epic documentaries, I expected great things from Life. Visually, you could not ask for more and is everything you would come to expect from the BBC. But, epic documentaries should come with narratives that do the video justice. One would think that with such stellar cinematography that it would be hard to ruin such a good program. Oprah out-does herself and not only sucks all enjoyment from the series but renders it unwatchable.    Look for the David Attenborough version and let the star rating do the talking before you flush your cash down this toilet. I am greatly looking forward to the US release of the BBC version in June so I can finish watching this series I was unable to stomach the first time around. Attenborough brings a depth and grace to series like these that other narrators can only hope to achieve. If you want to enjoy this series, grab the BBC version. If you enjoy being talked down to and feeling your intelligence is insulted, then Oprah comes through in spades here.
B001LF2WCC|4.0|It's the definitive version of 300. It has so many extras you will want to watch it again and again.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|This movie seems to be biased against the big food industry, the ones that provided that triple bypass with cheese for 99 cents you just had for lunch. It does however provide an intriguing look into the mass food/fast food industry and how consumers are being manipulated. It shows a lowly soybean farmer being harrased by a big corporation, and without giving us all the facts, tries to create sympathy for the poor fellow when in fact he was probably involved in illegal activity. This movie also exposes the ugliness of the mass slaughtering of animals and is rather disturbing.  In my opinion this movie doesn't address the obvious - over population! Without the mass food industry the world would be starving.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Watching this DVD really took me back to the seeing the show in Chicago & Detroit.  The one difference is the Argentina crowd really knows how to show their appreciation for Madonna!  The US crowds didn't seem to have quite this much energy.    The quality of the show on DVD is amazing, and great sound.  I love the CD, but missing tracks from the DVD makes it not as much fun to listen to.    Would have liked a better photo book, but overall the packaging is nice and has some great shots from the show.    Overall, IMO this show is so much more fun than The Confessions Tour, which was more on the scripted side.    Can't believe someone her age can perform such an intense show.  Love it!
0634049011|1.0|If you are a beginner like I am, you may well find this book as frustrating as I do. There are many books out there who explain the same subjects in a much easier way. This book is a waste of money !!!
1400052173|4.0|The book is definitely worth readig.  I recommend it.  I first heard of Mrs. Henrietta when I read Harriet Washington's book Medical Aparthied, and the author of Emerging Viruses.  These two books made me want to know who this woman was.    The book was an easy read, though I think their were lite elements of sensationalism in it.  I felt sorry for Deborah, learning about her mother made her an emotional wreck,and probably contributed to her early death.  It appeared that she did not have anyone in her family to turn to.    What I noticed is that the author go on ad nausem about the Lacks men and their problems.  However, she only mentions Deborah daughter once and she never tells us about her.  I guess she wasn't an emotionally wreck and in and out of jail.      I am not surprised at all by what happen to Mrs. Henrietta.  It is all to common thing to happen to Black people.    What disturbed me the most is the Lackses' family tradition of incest and how the females of the family was preyed on by the male relatives.
B0033G9OFA|5.0|I haven't a clue what's wrong with reviewers who gave it a 1 RATING but I personally being California's ultimate Doors fan, my license plate is \\"MOJOJIM\\", I can truely say I was blown away by the album.  Johnny Depp reading Jim's poetry was absolutely spooky and no one else could have done any better than Jim himself.  I'm just waiting for the chance to see movie.  Rest in peace Lizard King.
0547258305|5.0|I'm a college student with less than 4 weeks left of my semester, so finding time for pleasure reading isn't always easy. I MADE time for this book. I started it during a lull in my weekly schedule and was almost late to my next class because I just couldn't put it down. The story truly gripped me. From the very beginning I was ensnared, captivated, if you will, by these characters. When they hurt, I hurt. When they love, I love. Cashore presents them in such a way that you can't help but feel for them. In fact, I was so deeply invested in these characters that when I turned the last page of the book and found that I was at the end, I felt a deep sense of loss. I wanted so much more! And that's the mark of good writing. It leaves you begging for more.     In regards to the \\"young adult\\"-ness of this book, well, I think that both teens and adults will enjoy it. For teens, it will be the adventure and the romance that keeps them entertained. For adults, it will be the internal struggles and the deep emotional connections you make with the characters...and the adventure and romance. I thoroughly enjoyed this book despite being above the recommended age, and I would definitely give it to my Mom to read in a heartbeat. I know she'd love it as well. These books remind me a little of Tamora Pierce's novels, both in subject, style, and universal appeal. The strong female presence was something else that reminded me strongly of Pierce. Certainly it's a book that will attract girls more than boys (or as my fiance puts it, a \\"chick book\\"), primarily because the heroine is a strong female and there is a good bit of romance in it. Still, a guy could read it and enjoy it, though perhaps not feel as strongly connected to the female characters as a woman would.     Overall, I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, but with a couple caveats. First, and this one is for parents and discriminating teens, there is an interesting viewpoint on marriage that not all moms will approveof. Katsa is adamantly against marriage, and when the choice is to marry Po or to just love him freely and without any bond, Katsa chooses the latter. For the character, it seems appropriate, but for many young girls who don't yet know their opinions on marriage, it could be confusing. I am engaged to be married, and even I found myself hoping Katsa wouldn't choose marriage, simply because it would be a compromise of her character. It would seem forced and totally out of character for her. In short, it would have actually made me like the book less. Perhaps, in time, (a VERY LONG TIME) Katsa will come to consider Po something of a husband, but I do not think they will ever marry. Parents should be prepared for this. My second caveat is this: do not open this book until you have ample time to devote to it. I have been sneaking reads between classes for the past 2.5 days because I just couldn't put it down. If you have something important you need to get done and you don't want to be distracted, don't pick up this book. Truly, you will be caught up in it from page one and when you get to the end you will be crying for more. Don't say I didn't warn you.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|Just when you think rock is dead, or at least dying, a talent like Slash comes along and reminds us that great rock & f'n roll is out there.  Is every song perfect? No.  The breadth of musical genres and voices on this album means that not everyone will like every track.  That being said, while the album is not thematic, it is cohesive in that it's built around great licks and fantastic rhythms. Plus: guitar solos.  I hope they're back to stay.  Look around for the bonus tracks \\"Baby Can't Drive\\" and \\"Paradise City\\", as they aren't on the Amazon version but are worthy of a listen.  BUY THIS ALBUM!  Afterthought: as others have said: Nice job, Fergie. You have exceeded our expectations.
0385737947|2.0|To be honest, there are very few books that I don't even finish. Unfortunately, this was one of them. It wasn't long after I started that I began to be bored with the whole situation. The characters were dry and their conversation seemed slightly unnatural. I just felt the whole book was overrated and boring. There was little action. The characters were static and flat. The plot moved ever so slowly onward. I couldn't take it anymore and I committed the cardinal sin of avid readers: I flipped to the back. The ending was a disappointment. Having read less than half of the book, I found that the ending was so predictable. It made sense even from my limited view. I put the book down then and there and walked away. I haven't regretted it. The book is still on standby if I'm ever extremely bored or totally devoid of something new to read, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and I certainly won't start reading it again unless I'm desperate. I kept thinking it would get better, but by the time I stopped reading (somewhere around chapter 8 or 10...I forget) it was still slow and boring. Now, I am generally slightly biased against dystopian literature, just because I never find it particularly satisfying (which is the only reason this book got 2 stars instead of 1- I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and curving the grade, so to speak), but this was even duller than other dystopian books I've read. In my opinion, you'd be better off skipping this one.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|There's never a dull moment in Legend of the Seeker.  This show has it all - a charismatic cast, sensational special effects that rival many a feature film,  and intelligent, comedic plots that subtley mix in a good moral message in between all the magical, mystical happenings.  I dare you to look away when super suave and sexy villain Darken Rahl (Craig Parker) storms onto the scene.   My favorite episodes (Puppeteer, Conversion and the season finale)of course feature Rahl, and my only complaint is that they don't give him more screen time - he is so good at being bad.   Even if you already watched the show, you won't want to miss the cast's irreverent commentaries.   (Especially funny was Bruce Spence's and Parker's comments about the Puppeteer episode) So what are you waiting for?  Buy it and be swept away into a world of awesome, inspiring adventure
B000HM2NS8|3.0|Aside from the wear and tear on the D.C.  I am very happy with the product and the quick service.
B00319ECHE|5.0|After a hiatus, industrial metal powerhousers Fear Factory have returned with a vengeance, and with guitarist Dino Cazares and vocalist Burton C. Bell both patching things up and putting their differences aside, and now with former Strapping Young Lad bassist Byron Stroud who's been with FF since he first joined them in 2003, and of course drummer Gene Hoglan who also has been in SYL. Their newest release \\"Mechanize\\" proves exactly that they're back in full force. This is definately the best album that Fear Factory have released in a long time, as well as their best since \\"Demanufacture\\" and \\"Obsolete\\". Words just cannot even describe how much I love this new album, it just pounds and hammers like a cybernetic beast with a straight up adrenaline rush of monstrous, pounding, rapid fire riffs, hammering drum beats and rapid double bass slamming, ghostly, atmospheric keyboard effects, aggressive screaming/growling, and eerie yet powerful melodies, I mean it's just absolutely amazing. Burton leads the charge as always with his amazing vocal abilities ranging from brutal, aggressive, and commanding growls and screams to eerie, haunting, and spine chilling melodic clean singing, and Dino meanwhile, does what he does best, pounding out monstrous, and crushing rapid fire machine gun like riffs, and this album shows that he hasn't lost his touch on the axe. Gene Hoglan is just a monster on here, I mean his drumming is absolutely amazing and flawless throughout with fast hard hitting beats and ripping machine gun like double bass pedal slamming, this guy destroys period. He is definately one of the best drummers in metal no questions asked.<br /><br />Favorite songs included:<br /><br />The opening title track is just pure bliss. I love how the song is introduced to what and how Fear Factory is, very machine like, cyber, mech, industrial sounding, and it gets you ready and ready, and then suddenly BOOM, the song explodes into a rapid fire barrage of hard hitting riffs, hard hitting double bass drumming, and aggressive vocals. This is definately one of my favorite songs on here. Other wicked pummeling cuts on here including \\"Industrial Discipline\\" and \\"Fear Campaign\\" are both fast and hammering headbangers that feature fast, pummeling drums and rapid guitars, and awesome melodic choruses, and \\"Fear Campaign\\" also features a nice shredding solo by Dino as well. My favorite song on here that being \\"Powershifter\\" is a powerful and monster cut that boasts angry blood pumping shouts, hammering machine gun riffing, and rapid double bass drumming, as well as some haunting yet amazing melodic sung parts that will stay stuck in your head for days. Not a single word can even describe how much I love this song, it's just amazing. Other highlights on here feature \\"Christploitation\\" which starts off with a chilling piano intro before going into a balls out and high energy onslaught of punishing riffs and pummeling drums, and blistering vocals that'll get your adrenaline going like crazy, as well as \\"Controlled Demolition\\" which is highlighted by more savage, rapid fire riffs, and more of Gene's super charged and over the top double bass drumming, and of course the haunting album closer \\"Final Exit\\" which ends the album on a real strong and haunting, yet melodic note that features excellent melodic singing from Burton.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Mechanize\\" is a mechanical, cybernetic, industrial beast that is locked and loaded, and ready to attack and destroy everything that tries to stand in it's way. This album is definately one of the best albums of 2010 so far, and it shows that Fear Factory are truly back in full force. Anyways, if you're a long time fan of Fear Factory, then \\"Mechanize\\" will definately satisfy your listening enjoyment and pleasure. I also recommend this to fans of Strapping Young Lad and even Divine Heresy too.ss drumming, and aggressive vocals. This is definately one of my favorite songs on here.

B002WY65VU|5.0|I love Romero and his classics, but this movie was just flat out fun from start to finish. The surprise cameo is hilarious, and Woody Harrelson wins you over immediately. His character, Tallahassee, is just perfect. This film is incredibly smart, and it keeps everything moving at a fast pace. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. If you like zombie flicks at all, this is one to own immediately, but even if you're not that big into the living dead, this is a keeper. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00102FELM|5.0|The first Scorpions release I ever bought was the Album - Fly To the Rainbow, and I've been hooked ever since Then I bought the 8-track version of Tokyo Tapes, and it completely blew me away. Ulrich Roth {as he was known then}, put on a guitar clinic as fas as live shows go. My favorites were Backstage Queen and Pictured Life. I was sad to see him leave the band after that magnificent performance.<br /><br />Fast forward 17 years, and I took my 12 year old daughter to see her first 'Rock' concert; Scorpions and Mister Big at Irvine Meadows Ampitheatre, during the Crazy World tour, which Klaus said was being recorded. To say the least, she was blown away by them as well.<br /><br />Now here it is 20 years later, and I purchased Live at Wacken. I am totally impressed by the show, especially seeing Uli John Roth, Michael Schenker, and Herman Rarebell being invited to play with them. It was a very good mix of old and new tunes. I was happy to see them play Speedy's Coming, Pictured Life, and In Trance. It gave Uli a chance to shine. And a particular great feature was when they played Ravel's Bolero, and Rudy got to do his head stand. The look on Matthias and Michael's faces when Uli kicked out the song was worth the price of admission. Matthias, Rudolph, and Pawel really were tight on every tune. This band seems ageless! And the energy that Rudy shows is what I believe has kept them going all these years. And it doesn't hurt having a front man like Klaus! This show was well worth the money I put down for it.<br /><br />I am hoping that when they finally come to the US, they do a show here in Arizona, and maybe invite the old guys along. I'm thinking of taking my daughter and 12 year old grand-daughter when I go. Keep on rocking guys.
B0010DGYJW|5.0|Blackie Lawless demonstrates superior songwriting/storytelling on this Amazing concept album.  Front to back, disc 1 is one great song after another.  Disc 2 begins with the end of Jonathan, and finishes up with Blackies narration of Jonathan's story, followed by a great cover of \\"When the Levy breaks, and then saw raw live W.A.S.P..  All in all, a great buy!

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I bought two Star Trek dvds to give as gifts. One went to my dad and the other to my stepdad; both of who are Star Trek fans. The dvd movie quality is great but the digital copy is not good quality at all. Maybe on a small screen or IPod but not on my large monitor I was trying to view it on. The actual movie is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sci-fi, action or Star Trek. Even if you don't like Star Trek from the past you should check this out because the graphics and acting and story line are great.
0452287022|4.0|\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" takes place in Delft, Holland at the home of 17th century Dutch painter, Johannes Vermeer. It is the imagined tale of the subject of the painting with the same name, the story of a maid in Vermeer's house.<br /><br />I didn't think I was going to like this book. I've heard people rave about it, but it didn't sound particularly interesting to me. I was surprised to find myself drawn into the story immediately. The characters and setting are vivid and instantly familiar. I couldn't put it down! Don't miss this one; it's a wonderful, quick read.
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Nothing I would consider ground breaking.  Nice guitars, good vocals.  Definately worth picking up.  Also, like a few of the other reviewers, I wasn't too excited about the thought of Fergie on one of the tracks.  I was mistaken..the tracks rocks.
9999028675|5.0|Every year when I read this book to my five-year old kindergarten students, they are totally awed. When I show them the video and give them large pieces of white paper and purple crayons, well, their \\"writing\\" simply flows along with Harold's drawings. Later they share their memories of Harold's drawings with their friends and classmates, ready in an instant to say, \\"Remember when.....?\\" and know what their friends are talking about. Of all the Harold books, I love this the best. It, like Baby Bear's bed, is sized \\"just right\\"!
0201633612|4.0|This book shows how to write reusable software in object oriented paradigm.  Reusable software has been the holy grail in software architecture.  The difficulty of writing good usable software is tremendous; a great deal of thoughts have to go into writing software.  After reading this book, I decided it was just too hard for me to write reusable object-oriented software; I won't be able to write the way the book has preached.  I gave up, at least, trying to write reusable object-oriented software.  The book was a good reading for me to know the vocabulary of reusable software elements.
B002YIHO7I|2.0|It pains me to write this review but I am compelled.  I am totally disappointed with Sade's new cd.  I am one of those diehard fans that purchased every cd she ever put out, and have seen her in concert twice.  I absolutely love her style and the way she sings.  The only cut I enjoy is \\"Soldier of Love'' and even that can get a little boring (you can't listen to it too much).  I can't believe I waited with baited breath for such a lukewarm production.  I'm in shock...
0340918616|2.0|Like most of the 1 star ratings...I hated the mother character....but I was horrified at the ending...how terrible....The subject of the book is interesting but the characters were horrible..at first I thought it was a memoir but was quite relieved when I read novel on the cover...
B000TSIK14|5.0|I've been a Scorpions fan since the late 70's, and \\"Humanity Hour\\" is hands-down my favorite album from their entire catalog! I keep this CD in my car on constant rotation...I can't get enough! I can't believe it took me over two years to even find out that this album even existed.
B0000033PB|4.0|Pretty good record, if a bit boring in places ... \\"Paper Blood\\" has a verse that is a revamp of the verse of \\"Money Talks\\", a song he and Geoff Downes did in the Ride The Tiger project .. \\"Paper Blood\\" is a more well-rounded song, than the aforementioned ... The title track is kinda boring ... there are some other catchy songs, here and there ... \\"Affairs Of the Heart\\", a tune he did with Geoff Downes, which I guess Keith did the keyboards on here to make it an ELP song (with some light percussion from Carl toward the end) - is a great, haunting song.  \\"No one is too smart, in affairs of the heart ...\\"  .. More true words may never have been sung.  It's a kind of simple mid-range/low vocal, but Greg sings it with such conviction you believe it has just happened to him.  That's my pick of best song on the album.  The ELPowell album is a better record than this; the main issue is it just drags, in places ... fails to be interesting.  Greg has said in a couple interviews, in the '000s that the producer at the time was involved too much with the direction the album took, and the chemistry was not the same as on albums like Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery.  Well on ELPowell they had a producer and that album had great chemistry, as far as I'm concerned .. But one can see where Greg is coming from.  In his 60s now, I would think it's got to burn him up how on radio today (and on videos, OMG, on videos) the young people are subjected to these paper stars, (Rihanna, Lady gaga, Nicki Manaj, Black Eyed Peas ... I could go on), and told 'THIS IS COOL' by the music media ... When in the mid-70s and one record in the 80s he and his band made real music for a music industry who wanted real music.  Everybody liked \\"Touch and Go\\", and thought it was cool .... It's indeed a different age, and time will see if music, as a whole can ever possibly recover.<br />Anyway good album, though not their best .. 76%
B0038RONCS|4.0|I bought this after seeing his performance on American Idol because I was impressed with how much effort he gave.  Quite simply, if you enjoy(ed) user, and are disappointed with his latest effort (Raymond vs. Raymond), then check this CD out.  Even though the album is short, it gives us all a glimpse of what potential this kid has.  Just enough swagger to exude confidence, yet remain humble.  All the songs are sung with absolute passion.      \\"What if\\" has alot of heart, and \\"Sky's the Limit\\" sounds like it's sung by a guy soaring with love.  \\"Fallen\\" is song over some nice guitar strings, which gives it a strong Taylor Swift sound, but Derulo manages to keep it close to mainstream R&B somehow.    \\"Ridin solo\\" is probably the weakest song, but very relevant to anyone who has suffered a breakup.  The album finishes up with probably the strongest ballad heard by a male artist in several years: \\"Blind\\".  Stunning vocals and arrangement.  This track is a male version of a strong Alicia Key's ballad.    Obviously \\"WhatchaSay\\" and \\"In My Head\\" are billboard hits.  I have a feeling we are going to be hearing a lot more from this artist.
0385523386|5.0|Incisive and vivid. This book will both give a real sense of life inside women's prison and also raise evocative questions about the justice system. I've only a few time read such a compelling first-person narrative. Kerman takes you inside the prison with her -- and inside her head while she's figuring this peculiar world out. This is a fully engaging book that I will read again.

B002ZHKZEC|5.0|In late-2008, David Tennant announced that he would depart from the long-running science-fiction series \\"Doctor Who\\" after four-plus years as the Tenth Doctor. His three regular seasons on \\"Doctor Who\\" saw the show reach its highest peak of quality and success. For his final year, he would star in five special episodes that would conclude the Tenth Doctor's journey through time and space. These final specials are packaged here in \\"Doctor Who: The Complete Specials.\\" And they deliver a fun, exciting, and emotionally-charged finale for Tennant.<br /><br />The set begins with \\"The Next Doctor,\\" the 2008 Christmas special. It's another fun adventure designed to bring fun family viewing. It's slightly predictable, and kind of wacky, but that's the spirit of the classic series, but does so with great visuals, fine storytelling and terrific performances.<br /><br />The next episode, \\"Planet of the Dead,\\" is the 2009 Easter special, where the Doctor and a bus-full of people are swept through a wormhole to a barren planet. While definitely the weaker episode in the bunch, it still delivers fun excitement, though being the first episode shot in High-def, the visual effects workers failed to match it with fine CG effects. But still, it's a fun adventure story, and the end warns the Doctor that his song will end; that something is returning through the dark, and that \\"he will knock four times.\\"<br /><br />The middle episode, \\"The Waters of Mars,\\" aired in November 2009. The Doctor lands on Mars in 2059, where creatures who inhabit the Martian water inhabit the human colonists there. But unlike most cases, where the Doctor must save the day, all the crew of Bowie Base One are in a fixed point in time, meaning they all must die. This is by far the scariest adventure of \\"Doctor Who,\\" but not for the creatures. Here, we see the Doctor gain a scary arrogance, as he saves the crew, breaking the laws of time. The suicide of one of the characters at the end breaks him of it, and he realizes he's gone too far, and knows his end is nigh. While an eerie, thrilling adventure with terrific storytelling and acting, this is one episode not suitable for family viewing because of it's darker tone and ominous conclusion.<br /><br />Rounding out the set are the definite-best episodes found in this collection: \\"The End of Time, Parts One and Two,\\" aired on Christmas Day 2009 and New Years' Day 2010. While this two-part adventure has drawn some criticism from fans, I feel it is the best adventure that has come out of the Russell T. Davies' era of Who. In this adventure, the Doctor once again faces his best enemy, the Master, while reuniting with Wilfred Mott, Donna Noble's Granddad, to face the greatest threat of all. It's a hilarious, wacky, and fun adventure in the spirit of the classic series, and pulls out all the stops to give David Tennant a fond farewell. While most of the story is definitely fun, the final twenty minutes, where the Doctor must sacrifice himself to save Wilf, and see all of his friends one last time before he regenerates, will definitely pull at the heart strings of all fans of the show. And though Tennant's departure is very sad, the arrival of Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor is hilarious, and gears us up for the beginning of the next era of the long-running series.<br /><br />This five-disc set marks the debut of \\"Doctor Who\\" on Blu-ray, and although the set is a little pricey, it's definitely worth it! The picture quality is fantastic, and the extras are terrific! The one complaint is the audio, with the dialogue slightly drowned out by the music and sound effects. But this is a small problem, and doesn't take away from this amazing set.<br /><br />Overall, the good Doctor's debut on Blu-ray is terrific, and the five fantastic episodes on this set deliver an excellent farewell for David Tennant as the Doctor.

B0027DK206|4.0|I love this back!  It takes great Diana pictures with the benefit of Instax film.  Some other reviewers seems to have a lot of trouble getting good pictures but I haven't had this issue--just don't shoot inside if you don't have a flash, and be aware of your aperture setting, that's all.  I do have to say that it's not worth buying full-price; at $95 and $7 per CR2 battery on top of Instax film and how much a Diana camera can get is just too much.  I found mine for $50, which was just fine for me.  If you can find it for a great price and love the idea of combining instant film with your Diana, go for it!

0061537969|5.0|Worthy is the author who employs a literary device--a gimmick, if you will--as the engine of his/her novel, and subsequently pulls it off in spades.  Usually such devices are used sparingly in a story; and if they work, they work only nominally.  Such is not the case with Garth Stein's THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN--a novel told from the point of view of Enzo, an aged and crippled lab mix.  Such a farfetched device certainly registered on my skepticism scale, so I picked up this novel fully prepared to malign it; instead I found myself quickly lost in the story of Enzo, and his special relationship to Denny, his master.  My skepticism faded like scattering clouds above Seattle's Space Needle, as Enzo narrated his story with warmth, humor, depth, and unbounded love.<br /><br />Denny is a part-time Formula One race car driver, so because he watches hours of tapes of himself in the cockpit--or of other famous Le Mans or Grand Prix classics--Enzo watches the same.  Accordingly Enzo becomes a student of racing--particularly racing in the rain, a gift Denny is fortunate enough to possess.  So the novel is full of observations about racing.  Look, I don't know beans about Formula One racing, but Enzo's metaphorical comparisons to racing and life are absolutely mesmerizing.  (\\"The car goes where your eyes go.\\")  They are yet another enjoyable aspect to this most heartwarming story.<br /><br />As Enzo reflects on his life, from his puppyhood when Denny adopted him to Denny's tragic marriage to Eve and the birth of their daughter to Denny's subsequent pain and hardships, his narrative is poignant, tender, humorous, and inspiring.  And because Enzo spends so much time watching TV, his narrative also is a reflection of the culture, which will leave a smile on your face.  The ending is moving, Stein's prose simple yet elegant, and THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN utilizes its literary device like a champion taking a hairpin curve.  Truly marvelous.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B0027BOL4G|1.0|This is yet another leftist documentarian who wants to tear down some aspect of Western Civilization.    Essentially you have a Michael Moore like whinefest over the Food Industry by someone desperate to be noticed, to make his money from the mean ole capitalism system, and to tell the world how wonderful he is for being local produce vegan.    \\"Look at me, look at me, I'm so much better than you!\\"  \\"Yes, people,when you get that Big Mac, you are going to die, die, die!\\"  \\"And in addition, you are killing...the WHOLE FRIGGING EARTH!\\"    It's typical liberal boilerplate.  Take some problems, that are going to be in any system, much less something as insanely huge as the Food Industry, throw in Religious Enviromentalism, Anti-Capitalism, let bake along with some good ole USC film techniques.    Serves any group of self righteous people silly enough to watch it.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|Of course it wasn't what I was expecting but it is SO GOOD and keeps getting better with each listen.  It's not easy listening.  It's not background music.  Sometimes it's a little TOO intense. Mirrorball has to be the best track and it is a triumph (never heard the original).  Anybody who would call this record \\"mellow\\" has a very limited understanding of music.  This version of Heroes is cinematic and epic.  Once again Mirrorball is the kind of piece that makes you want to take a big risk that will change the course of your life.  I'm talking purely from the musical perspective, when you add the lyrics it feels like deeply reveling in the joys of the human experience.    Book of Love is Tender and deeply touching.  Boy in the bubble is contemplative and raw.    Just an amazing album.  I never know what he's going to do next but he NEVER disappoints and always leaves me feeling like I have grown just by listening.    It goes way beyond rock and pop and to listen is to evolve, no wonder some listeners are scratching their heads unable to comprehend what this is.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|this was a awesome film for special effects there was no places in this film that left you bored, it kept my attention through out the film .  If you like special affects like i do then you will like this film.  there is some scenes that are a little exaggerated but the effects were amazingly done.   See this on a large screen its impressive i really liked the ending of the film.
B001B7CNXI|5.0|I grew up on the show. This movie is not the show. It doesn't try to be the show, doesn't throw around a bunch limp, mindless inside-joke homages to the show, and sure as hell never apologizes for the fact that it is not, in fact, the original TV show. In fact, I don't recall a single joke or moment of comic relief. And that, my friend, is a relief. This is a different beast entirely, and God I love it. Fantastic film if you're willing to overlook the fact that it's not a failed attempt to reattain former glory of a campy (although great) 80's television program.

0385523386|1.0|When I read this book through in one sitting I thought, how interesting.  Then I considered what I had read.  After being told clearly what her lover's friends did, Little Miss Free Spirit, not only undeterred but apparently viewing it as a fun, new experience in her life, attaches herself to a bunch of very high level drug runners and is then shocked after sponging on these people for some time when they insist she run some drug money.  Apparently while absorbing her sense of Entitlement and Free Spiritedness she forgot to note that there are no free lunches.  Never mind free trips to the classiest places in the world.<br /><br />It takes ten years for her fun drug days to catch up with her.  Unfair!  Her fling days are over and anyone can see that, so why come after her now?  At least that seems to be her and her family and friends take on it.  After all, girls just wanna have fun.<br /><br />After that she does time with a whole prison of misunderstood women.  I frankly do not believe the time was as easy as she describes it, not matter how hard on her she saw it.  If you read closely it is more like she is describing a not very expensive rest camp where the campers (she calls her prison \\"The Camp\\" and the inmates \\"Campers\\") have to do some work each day but, not to worry, her adoring fiance and family inundate her with books so she can relax comfortably in her spare time. The only issue she reports between herself and another inmate is she is picking all the fresh spinach out of the salad and gets called on it by another prisoner.  Now that is what I call hard time.<br /><br />Also note that Miss I-have-a-degree-from-Smith declines to tutor any of these poor, misunderstood women who did not get a fair start in life. Her given reason:  Too much trouble.<br /><br />For a finale she does brief time in a much less nice prison in Chicago.  But even here the most she really complains about is how dirty everything is.  Apparently all the inmates are just as sweet as pie.  Not even a squabble over spinach.  After one year she is still expecting that when she asks a question it will be promptly answered by the guards.  Her irritation that the guards are not hopping to it at her request irritates her.<br /><br />After reading her book I came to the conclusion she is a spoiled brat who got off very lightly, with her sense of entitlement not even dented, and having learned nothing.  Aided and abetted by her family, her fiance, and even his family.<br /><br />I would return the book, just so she could not benefit from the sale, but I have already read it.  I suggest no one else buy the book.  She lived in a six star world, eyes open to the drug money that was paying for her good time, messed up her drug money run, had ten years of comfortable freedom, did one year in what, by her description, was a comfortable camp, got out, married her fiance to general applause, and wrote a book to more applause.  Do not reward her by buying this book.  One year in a two star hostel does not begin to make up for the hell she helped put on our streets.  Really, that is what she and her family and friends do not acknowledge.  And which makes me so angry.  She was not an innocent bystander in the drug war, but an active participant in making it easy for lives to be destroyed, while happily collecting all the perks that go with drug running.pinach.

1400052173|5.0|If ever there was a textbook example of how to write a biography that is at once emotionally compelling, thought-provoking, engrossing in every detail, true to the spirit and life of the subject, and a gateway to honest debate about the science and ethics of cellular research and the use and distribution of human cells and/or tissues, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, by Rebecca Skloot, is that book.<br /><br />Ms. Skloot has taken what might have been, at best, an interesting case history of cell harvesting and mass-regeneration, and breathed life into the cells in question -- the cervical tissue cells of Henrietta Lacks, a middle-aged Black woman from Baltimore who, while dying of cancer in the early 1950s, was the unwitting donor of blood cells that, for all intents and purposes, wouldn't die. Her cells, tagged by the Johns Hopkins researchers as HeLa cells, have been at the core of myriad medical breakthroughs for more than 60 years.<br /><br />Lacks, and her family, living on the edge of poverty (to this day), unable to comprehend the arcane, seemingly (to them) mystical world of cellular research such as it was in mid-20th century, could not have imagined the vast network of healthcare benefits, ethical and legal entanglements, and, passionate--sometimes ugly--debate Henrietta's immortal cells would create.<br /><br />But when Rebecca Skloot, then 16, sitting in a community college biology class in 1988, heard her instructor describe Henrietta's amazing cells, the first ever to be grown, and to continue to grow, in a laboratory, she was driven to know more, to find the who, the why, the how -- everything about Henrietta Lacks, and to tell Henrietta's story in such a way as to reveal a fascinating account of one woman's unwitting contribution to humanity.<br /><br />Lacks' story is heartbreaking and uplifting all at once; from a sharecropper's farm in southern Virginia, to the cold and sterile Black-only examining rooms of Johns Hopkins (as it was in 1950), to the vacuum of space, to the research and development labs of billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies, Henrietta Lacks, as guided by Skloot, shows us the path she, and her cells, have traveled.<br /><br />This is a must read that encompasses the health sciences, legal and medical ethics, corporate greed, civil rights, spiritual strength, rural and urban life of the 1950s, and so much more. Every shelf should have room made for The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.research and development labs of billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies, Henrietta Lacks, as guided by Skloot, shows us the path she, and her cells, have traveled.

1400079276|5.0|I won't bore you with the details that dozens of other reviews mention.  Instead, if you are a fan of Murakami, read this book several times.  Each time is a little different and you pick up on metaphors, symbols, and events that you might have missed the first or second time through.  Even Murakami himself says to read multiple times (on his website).  Highly recommended as an intelligent, modern twist on Oedipus Rex.<br /><br />I know a lot of people complain that there are thematic elements here that appear in many other Murakami works, and I wholeheartedly agree.  But I am praising this as a stand alone novel and a great introduction to Murakami.  This is not as subtle and complex as his other works, but reading this before diving into others is recommended.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Easily the best album i've heard in the past 2 years.  Everything about it is different and she's not scared to let a song slowly build, yet each track just gets progressively better and better and better.  'Girl with One Eye' is a prime example of a song that she allows to slowly unfold and it ends brilliantly.  The music is moody, the vocals loud and clear and the feelings conveyed are strong and slightly dark.  sit back and let this album take you out of the everyday!
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I am in love with everything Harry Potter, and watched this movie when it came out and bought the DVD as well. I have all the Harry Potter DVDs. Anyway, I did not like this movie as much as the others. There were too many things, important things, which are in the books that did not show up at the movie. For instance, I felt showing Lord Voldemort's past about his family from his mother's side, and his mother's story would have added to the movie. There were more memories in Dumbledore's pensieve that were central to the story that the movie did not show.<br /><br />Again, I enjoyed the earlier Harry Potter movies more than the recent ones. I am not fond of the director, David Yates, that has been directing (badly) the latest installments.<br /><br />Also, I missed the portrayal of a young Tom Riddle by Christian Coulson from \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\" Nothing against the new actor playing a young Lord Voldemort, but I felt that the former was better suited for the role.<br /><br />Otherwise, great movie. I am very much looking forward to \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\\"
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I don't want to do a song by song review.  But just note that each track has a style catered to each featuring artist, but still remaining very \\"Slash\\".<br />It's almost like Slash was making tribute or homage to his current favorites.<br />How good is this album?  I hate the Black Eyed Peas, I can't stand Fergie most of the time...but I am eating crow right now.  \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" featuring Fergie is turning into one of my favorite tracks.<br />I really hope they can perform this live somewhere, perhaps another late night gig.  The energy she brings must be seen.<br /><br />Well done Slash, I see myself playing this album for weeks on end.

8590379825|5.0|This book is an unbeatable introduction to the Lua programming language, as might be expected considering it's written by the language's creator. However, the book is also an excellent guide to programming in general, because Roberto explains concepts which are applicable in most other languages. Maybe this is because Lua was designed primarily as a 'glue' or 'embedded' language. The author's ability to explain complex ideas is outstanding. You may have to re-read a paragraph a couple of times to fully 'get' it, but once you do everything just clicks.<br /><br />Also, don't expect this book to be limited to an introduction to the language. That introduction is pretty solidly handled in the first 60 pages or so. For your money, you also get information on integrating your Lua code with your C code, techniques for coroutines and multi-threading, and advanced uses of the Lua table object (including object-oriented programming).<br /><br />But wait -- there's more! There's a run-through of Lua's standard libraries which is not your standard printout of the online documents -- it's full of useful, progressive examples. I found the string library documentation particularly useful. Just by reading the table of contents you'll see that this is a very well-thought-out book, and I can vouch for its execution being excellent as well.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|People are insanely critical. This transfer is just fine, maybe even great. And above all else, any excuse to not own this blu-ray is a poor one. A brilliant and truely timeless film.
B0000009SM|5.0|This album is an astonishing piece of work. The arrangement, pacing, vocals, song selection, everything on this CD is rock music at its finest.<br /><br />Zappa was a musical genius and it shows in spades on this album. The tragedy is that essentially none of these cuts received any amount of commercial air play. Compared to most songs that get saturation air play every 10 minutes these nine are nothing less than golden nuggets of musical brilliance. Zappa's lyrics are at times funny, intelligent, nonsensical and witty; also his timing is always perfect. He seems to know exactly when the appropriate moment is to interject his legendary guitar play into various sections of these tracks.<br /><br />I own eight other Zappa CDs with this one easily being one of the best. Of course he has such an eclectic catalogue that it's impossible to single out one particular album as his finest work. One Size Fits All is definitely in the top five.
006621131X|5.0|Great story of the beginning/evolution of an artist.  I could not put this book down.  The story flows so beautifully - it deserves all its accolades.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|You should base you decision as to whether or not you want to buy this CD on the 268 persons who gave AFTERGLOW 5 stars. Especially those who went into great detail.  That is all I have to say.  The previous 5 star reviewers have said it for me.  What more could I possibly say?  AFTERGLOW IS A GREAT CD!!!  DON'T PASS IT BY.
B0030Y10QQ|5.0|Finally is all I can say that we get a newer updated version of one of the most forgotten metal bands from the 80's and early 90's greatest hits.  I have in my collection a very best of two disc set that came out of the Edel label some years ago but I rarely play it anymore since I don't want to damage it any further and it was really used when I got my hands on it anyway.  To any event this collection is a must I have listened to it completely all the way through and I love it.  To the people that say it is not essential, needed or complete well that may be true if you want to own every single album.  Granted their could have been more tracks added to the collection but I love it and I am not pickey when a Savatage greatest hits collection is released b/c I am a fan that doesn't have the money, time or put in the effort of tracking down and buying every album.  I love the concert DVD as well and I cannot wait and see if we can possibly get a greatest hits #3 or a b-sides disc etc... from Mr Oliva and O'Neil in later releases.<br /><br />Buy this collection now it is essential and great Savatage restored music.
0385504225|3.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books, and each was well worth it.  The Lost Symbol explored a culture that I grew up close to - the Masons - but about which I knew very little.  What interested me about this book, aside from the theme, was the author's ability to establish mini cliff-hangers at the end of chapters to entice the reader to keep reading.  This reminded me of the Tom Swift series of books I read as a child. I had many of the books, such as Tom Swift and His Jetmarine and Tom Swift and His Flying Lab.  Returning to the present, although The Lost Symbol is great but not as exciting as The DaVinci Code, its future certainly ought to include a movie.  Makes you wonder what really goes on in the world surounding us.
B00005KARK|5.0|Like many Disney animated films, this one has a moral--actually two.  First, no matter how \\"weird\\" or \\"different\\" you may be, you have something that makes you valuable; all you have to do is find it.  Second, when you find it, have faith in it--and yourself--and you will triumph.  Thus Dumbo, officially named Jumbo Jr., a baby circus elephant who arrives with ears bigger than he is.  Since, like most circus elephants, he's supposed to be an *Indian* elephant, and therefore have nice small ears, all the other pachyderms (except his loving mother) treat him as a freak, and when human visitors to the menagerie make fun of him and she bursts out in fury, she's chained and imprisoned as a \\"mad elephant,\\" depriving him of her company.  Only Timothy Mouse, a rodent with a band jacket and a Brooklyn accent, is willing to be his friend and to encourage him to hope.  It isn't till they both accidentally get drunk on a tub of watered wine (or wined water!) that Dumbo finds his \\"value\\": his big ears can be used as wings!    You couldn't make this movie today: somebody would be sure to complain that the slightly surreal \\"Pink Elephants on Parade\\" (which looks as if it wandered in out of [[ASIN:B00003CX9W Fantasia (Special 60th Anniversary Edition)]] by mistake) was disrespectful to alcoholics, or that the Boss Crow and his \\"brothas\\" were racist.  Yet both segments are vital to the development of the story, and the crows are in fact instrumental to helping Dumbo discover that he doesn't have to be under the influence in order to take off.  There are also several myths upheld by the story--that the stork delivers babies, that ostriches hide their heads in the sand, that elephants are afraid of mice.  But of course, in the end, Timothy's faith, Dumbo's courage, and Mrs. Jumbo's love prevail, and they roll off into the sunset to the happy strains of the crows' song.  A classic that all families should own, whether there are kids around or not.
1423113497|5.0|The three books arrived in 15 days  as I have requested, in a good quality  without any problems.    I will buy others books in the near future from Amazon.    Thank for Amazon for their good service.
B001UV4XX8|1.0|Don't waste your time or money.  Bad acting & bad writing.  I could've written & directed this film better myself.  The only thing I liked about this movie was the old man.  He looked creepy and gave the film an older feel like in Poltergeist. I'm a big fan of Camerson Diaz, but her accent in this film was awful.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of THE best books I have read in quite awhile.  Fast-paced and interesting, this book kept me wanting more until the end, at which point I was disappointed the book was over (already?)!  Based in post-WWII London and the English Channel, this charming little book tells the story of the people who lived it and how they were able to come out of the war in one piece.<br /><br />The book also describes the power of reading and how, despite individual interests, that common activity can bring people together during the worst of times, transforming their lives forever.  This is definitely a \\"must-read\\" for anyone who is a fan of historical fictions and human relationships.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|It's a dangerous thing to expose the ending of an incredibly important television show before the rest of the world gets to see it; how would you like it if someone told you who won American Idol before the first round even airs?  But now that I've seen the epic conclusion to LOST, well, I have no choice but to reveal the ending.  Why?  Because your lives depend on it.    So I'm sure you've seen what's been aired so far.  Not-Locke (\\"Smocke\\") is plotting his escape from the island and our beloved characters are choosing sides.  A bizarre alternate reality shows Ben as a teacher and Hurley with a tremendous dose of good luck.  Viewers are speculating whether these \\"flash-sideways\\" will somehow converge with the island reality, causing the characters to make even bigger decisions about how their lives should progress.  But what you the viewer should be considering instead is, what does YOUR existence mean?    For this is not fantasy my friends.  Oh, no; soon YOU will be making the decision of what dimension you want to exist in.  Damon and Carlton have said all along that they've known what the final scene of LOST would look like since they started the show.  Now I know why.  They've become privy to information that, if revealed to the public at large instead of just these two talented writers, would have torn the world apart with fear and anxiety.  LOST was created to prepare us for the real 'incident' that will occur just after the final episode airs in May.      On May 23rd, at 11:42p.m. (23:42 military time), a massive electromagnetic burst will hit planet Earth.  When it does, time will split into at least three separate timelines.  Depending on what you're doing at that exact moment, you will be thrust into one of these dimensions.  In one, every material object you ever wanted can be yours but you will no longer be able to love.  In another, you will be with your true love but your moral compass will be askew and you'll find yourself riddled with guilt.  And inthe third, all free will must be given up but you will be guaranteed a life filled with peace.  It will be your choice.      If I were you, I'd pre-order the DVD box set before the incident. That way, you'll probably be able to take it with you regardless of the dimension you end up in.  We all need a constant.
B0035G9ABG|5.0|This is an article I wrote for my school's newspaper about Plastic Beach:      After a five year hiatus, the world's most famous animated quartet composed of 2D, Russel, Murdoc, and Noodle, otherwise known as Gorillaz, are back with their highly-anticipated album Plastic Beach. Though the album is set to be released on March 8, early last week the band gave NPR and a handful of media outlets permission to let fans listen to it before it hits shelves.    Damon Albarn, Gorillaz `creator' and best known as the front man of Blur and The Good, the Bad, and the Queen, arrived back strong as a songwriter, producer, and lead singer. With Plastic Beach Albarn has recruited an arsenal of featured artists such as Lou Reed, Mike Jones of The Clash, Snoop Dogg, De La Soul, among others. The first single, Stylo, which was leaked by band member Murdoc on the bands website was the first wacky gesture as he cited \\"A leak! A leak! Plastic Beach has sprung a leak! One of those Russian pirates has put a bullet hole in my island! My single's leaked! STYLO!\\" The single features rap star Mos Def and R&B singer Bobby Womback, with Albarn taking the back seat vocally, in a sleek and funky roll-your-windows-down tune.    A beautiful two-minute orchestral trailer takes you to the fictional beach as oceanic clips hover over the symphony. The listeners \\"arrival\\" at the beach happens with none other than the swanky sounds of Snoop Dogg as he greets the listener with \\"Kids, gather around/Yeah, I need your focus/I know the world seems so hopeless/it's like a wonderland,\\" and as a final salute before delving in, \\"Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach\\".    Perhaps the characters of the band wanted to show playfulness and ease above all in this album. Albarn takes cues from Arabian influences as well as Caribbean ones. \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" is the most familiar Gorillaz sound with Albarn's smooth voice gliding over rhythmic tones and a M.I.A.-esque choral sound bite, that gives you the ache to danceas much as their past hit \\"19-2000\\" as he chants \\"I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower/that you made with plastic powder/Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away.\\"    If you are only familiar with radio hits such as \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" and \\"D.A.R.E.,\\"his may not be the record for you. While that contagious rhythm that remains constant in most songs is present, this is unexplored territory; their personal dark side of the moon. Each song is unique in its own and is contrived in the least, which means that this unfamiliarity is very much an acquired taste.     Above all, what Albarn and the gang have accomplished with this album is refreshingly joyous, and they have managed to reach unprecedented levels of playfulness and tranquility not always heard in their music. Take a break. Relax. Let the music consume you, and surely you'll be at the Plastic Beach in no time.
0446569895|5.0|I don't typically write reviews, nor do I read autobiographies of celebrities but I had to in this case.  I've been a fan of Ozzy since the mid 80s and thoroughly enjoyed this book!  It is written very well, like he's sitting with you telling these stories - a very personal P.O.V.  I highly recommend it especially if you know a little about Ozzy but would like to get to know him better as a person and the \\"why\\" behind his life story and the stories that you've heard.   Enjoy!
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I think this is probably my favorite vampire movie and is among my favorite horror movies as well.  This movie is great.  \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" won 3 academy awards:  1.) Best Costume Design, 2.) Best Make-Up, 3.) Best Sound Effects Editing. The music in the movie is really well composed by Wojciech Kilar.  The score is completely haunting and operatic and features a couple moments of vocals performed by Diamanda Galas, an amazing avant-garde vocalist. So the music really suits the dark atmosphere of the film.  I personally think this is Gary Oldman's best role, as he is brilliant portraying Count Dracula.  The downside of the acting is definitely Keanu Reeves (whoa) and Winona Ryder, who are directed well enough by Coppola to make it through some awkward dialogue scenes.  Anthony Hopkins co-stars as Van Helsing and has a great performance.<br /><br />I have read some people's lower-star reviews on this movie and I think if you don't like the movie solely because it doesn't stick 100% to the original book by Bram Stoker you are completely missing the director's vision.  I've also read complaints from the blu-ray customers saying that the blu-ray transfer is really bad, but I own the regular DVD, and the remastering looks perfect on my disc.<br /><br />The discs come with really cool special features.  There are 4 documentaries about the making of the film, clocking in at around 70 minutes or so.  There are also over 30 minutes of deleted scenes, so in the end, this is a must-have collector's edition.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />I think Coppola has another triumph in \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", one of my favorite films. 5 Stars.
0312370849|4.0|This book will stay with you for a while.  LIke the book [[ASIN:0156031663 Those Who Save Us]]its a telling story of what happened during 1942 and how it affected the people before, during and after.<br />I didn't realize the depth of what happened in France so I found the history especially interesting (and sad).  I enjoyed the writting style - going from past to current kept it riveting. I highly recommend.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I might be 20 years old, but I loved this movie. It's nice to watch a film that has little drama. The cast is adorable and there are many silly storylines built into the main storyline. I DEFINITELY recommend this film for girls of all ages. Completely appropriate and fun for all ages. (Even my boyfriend liked it!)
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I bought this CD because I enjoyed a couple of the videos/songs I saw on youtube. As I listened to both cds I couldn't help feel that Gagas music seemed familiar. Gagas music to me sounds a lot like pop music from the 80s with a dash of club dance music from 80s/early 90s. I bet you if you go back and listen to some Taylor Dayne, Samantha Fox, Nu Shooz you'll see what I mean. These are just singers off the top of my head there are a ton more. The 80s had a lot of those electronic synthesizer/piano type sound effects which I believe I'm hearing in Gagas music.     Anyway, LOVE EVERY SONG. I was not a fan of popular music from the 90s all the way up till Lady Gaga. These CDS were an awesome surprise.    So IMHO Lady Gaga = music from my younger years retrofitted for todays ears.     If your older with kids like me the edited version is RAD! ;)
B002ZFQD04|5.0|I was able to see the Stick & Sweet tour in Boston Ma in Oct 2008.The day her divorce was announced.I have seen every tour of this living legend.I Bought the Dvd/Cd today and wow.As good as i remeber.The opening candy video is different then i saw & \\"Don't cry for me argentina\\" was not performed at my show because she only performed it for the dvd show only but how thrilled i was to see it performed in this brillant dvd.The case it comes in is wonderful with the booklet hidden in the cover.She rocks out in \\"Candy shop\\" taking her throne,She does a great rock version of \\"Borderline\\"(Only ever performed in the 1985 Virgin Tour..Then doing a killer more current version of \\"Vogue\\".Then she shows she's the best in \\"She's not me\\" Moving to a beautiful visual performance of \\"Devil wouldn't recognize me\\",Her voice never sounded better or more pure as she belts out \\"You must love me\\" & Don't cry for me Aregntina\\".The incredible and rock version of her classic \\"Like a prayer\\"is not to be missed.She then asked the audience what song they want her to sing and they all sing along with her to \\"Like a virgin\\"(My show we did \\"American Life\\")This is just an incredible and awsome dvd. The cd is just perfect with the 13 songs from the show but i only wish the cd was the full show.Oh and you can't forget the 30 minutes of bonus footage on the dvd.Well worth the very low ticket price.I would of paid more for it because it's worth more.I give this an A++++ and on a scale from 1-10 i score it a 15+... Thank you M for another great piece of work.  John
0312570740|4.0|The enigma that is Marc Rich comes thru clearly. As a brilliant commodities trader he did whatever it took to make money including trading with some of the world's most vile regimes and despicable characters.<br /><br />He claims, and after reading this book I believe he may be correct, that he never broke any laws and that he paid the taxes he owed. Rich believes he was railroaded by Rudy Giulliani for poltical reasons and for the exposure it would give the future Mayor of New York.<br /><br />Rich is not a sympathetic character but I found it fascinating that while the U.S. Marshall's chased him around the world for 25 years, he was willing to help other agencies of the U.S. and Israel by giving them access to his vast network of people in places dangerous like Iran, Iraq, Libya,and Yemen.<br /><br />Once he made his mega-fortune he also used his own money ( more than $100 million) for charitable or humanitarian purposes with great effect.<br /><br />The sections covering his pardon by President Clinton are fascinating and gives an insight into how the pardon process works, and what went wrong with this pardon in the end. Ultimately Rich will never again enter the USA.<br /><br />Rich seems to have lost almost everything but his fortune. His Country, his wife of over 20 years and a daughter to cancer. Finally, he was thrown out of the company he built by the very ingrates he had made obscenely wealthy.<br /><br />By the end of the book Rich seemed to me to be a sad and melancholy man living in his beautiful Switzerland home, far from the center of the action he once so craved. A prisoner in his gilded cage, placed there by his own blind ambition and singular chase for money.

B002KQOCJ2|5.0|I have been following Alice in Chains since the Dirt album and I own every album and I've never been let down, until the day Layne died. I felt that I would never heard Alice in Chains again, and that if I did, it would be stuff pulled from the vault. Or worse, I thought they would get a horrible \\"replacement\\" that couldn't create the Alice sound. When I saw William DuVall perform at the Rock Honors with Alice in Chains, I thought \\"This is amazing? This isn't Alice in Chains with some dude singing, this is Alice in Chains!\\" So I waited for an album for what seemed like forever. Then BAM! Out comes Black Gives Way to Blue. This album is amazing. Even the more repetitive tracks such as \\"All Secrets Known\\" are awesome and solid. \\"Last of My Kind\\", the only DuVall penned track is possibly the most forward and rockin' Alice song since \\"We Die Young\\". This album is filled with great tracks and such as \\"Your Decision\\" and the epic \\"Acid Bubble\\". \\"A Looking in View\\" is solid 1996 era Alice in Chains with a more polished sound.     William's voice isn't just good with Alice in Chains, it IS Alice in Chains and Jerry's songwriting is still as solid as a brick.     This album is amazing.    However, if you're considering the vinyl, I hope that you will receive something from a second press if it has made it out yet. The second LP on the first press does have a slightly off center hole therefore there is some wobble while listening. I however, kind of like it because it makes it sound even more drone-y like Alice records are.     Plus, it's amazing CLEAR vinyl too.

0385737947|4.0|Plot Summary:  A teenage boy wakes up in an elevator shaft with only one solid memory - that his name is Thomas.  When the door opens he finds himself surrounded by about 50 other boys who live at the heart of a giant maze.  No one remembers anything about their previous life, but some of them have lived in the maze for years and their only goal is to find a way out.  The day after Thomas arrives things begin to change, and the first big event is the arrival of a girl in the elevator.  She carries a message, and she has a strange connection to Thomas, who feels certain that he's seen her before.    I have been up to my elbows in young adult dystopian fiction lately, and I have to say that I'm loving it all.  As this style becomes more and more popular, I feel like I'm drowning in a wealth of fantastic stories where authors have pushed the creative envelope.  Teenagers are an unlovable lot, and not many adults want to spend their recreational time reminiscing on their own pimple-ridden, hormonally unbalanced days, but taking teens out of high school and plopping them into surreal settings is inspired.  It's equally engaging for both adults and teen readers, and it'll be a while before I tire of this genre.      The Maze Runner by James Dashner is another strong example, and while some of these books appeal strongly to female readers (like Suzanne Collins's [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]]), this particular story is boy-centric.  When the lone female character, Teresa, arrives in the elevator, it made me think of the Smurf cartoon that I used to watch as a kid.  There's something a little sinister about a lone female being stuck with 50 teenage boys.  Even before Teresa arrived I was having flashbacks to \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and the truly horrific things that can happen when a group of boys tries to govern themselves.  All of my worries were for naught, because Mr. Dashner gave the boys in charge good morals and a strong sense of honor.      There's not much thatI can say that won't spoil the story.  This is a particularly grim and gruesome world, and not much is clear until the very end, but as the facts unfold it becomes obvious that someone or something very evil is toying with these young adults.  The way the book ends is both satisfying and terrifying.  I'm looking forward to the next installment, [[ASIN:0385738757 The Scorch Trials]], which will come out October 2010.

B002SQ364Q|4.0|Ang Lee tells a great story.<br />this time is no different, the film progresses and the story unfolds and looks completely different every 10 min.  the movie takes off and it is rather engaging from the start.<br /><br />I only have 2 complaints:  the kiss between Demetri Martin and the guy he likes- um FAKE?!?! it could have been SO hot, but it was obviously not even the actors... WHAT HAPPENED? after that the film sputters a bit- then the Paul Dano scene could have been a bit more graphic- I mean, we all know what they did, but it could have been painted a bit better- there again, I wonder if Demetri Martin chickened out....<br /><br />Overall, the story is great... and I give it 4 stars, but these 2 parts really missed the mark.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|What an inspiring and yet, another genuinely enjoyable feature film from the artists at Disney & Pixar studios. I went into this having high hopes as I'm a massive fan of all Disney/Pixar collaborations with the exception of Wall-E which I simply did not enjoy for reasons I honestly cannot explain. I have to say my expectations were not only met, but surpassed. This not only warmed the heart but tickled me to the point I was in genuine tears of laughter. These types of films have developed a way of telling a story through the art of pictures; there is no need for words but music and moving images can tell just as much of a story than an entire script could. Even though I didn't enjoy Wall-E, this is something that I will praise it for. The makers have developed a way of telling a story without needing to explain it to you through dialogue. Well paced and well depicted animation is all you need to really tell a story and this is why I appreciated this that little bit more.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Carl Fredricksen an elderly man who, as a child, idolised explorer, Charles Muntz. Charles Muntz, while Carl was a young boy was discredited as a fraud by claiming to have discovered the bones of a giant bird which he found at Paradise Falls in South America. Determined to prove himself, Charles vows to not return until he has brought back a living specimen of the bird. Meanwhile, Carl meets Ellie, a feisty young girl with the same explorative dreams as Carl and they become fast friends. Then begins the silent homage to their life as it shows them becoming married and living their lives together still as in love as the day they first fell for one another. Sadly, Ellie, in her old age passes away and Carl is left alone in the home they bought and decorated together and around the home skyscrapers are being built with Carl being constantly pressured to sell his home to the company building the skyscrapers. After a series of more annoying events, Carl decides he's had enough and wants to go on that adventure to Paradise Falls him and Ellie always wanted to go on. But instead of just jumping on a plane, he fills his house with balloons and decides to fly there and take his house with him.<br /><br />After the initial launch of the house, there is a lot more to the story as we are gradually introduced to Russell, a wilderness explorer aiming to achieve his \\"help the elderly\\" badge so he can become a senior Wilderness Explorer and in order to do this he is determined to help Carl with anything he needs help with. Then, when they make it to the wilderness we meet Kevin the giant bird and a talking dog named Dug. These are characters, although extremely different from one another, blend well together and actually make for a heart warming good guy ensemble cast. Some of the contents of the film are actually quite clich&eacute;. The grumpy old man who's grumpy because he never accomplished his dream and the young boy who has all the ambition in the world and just wants to impress his family. These are character traits indicative of the Disney genre, although that is no bad thing. The setting, although at times filled with vibrant colours, is actually quite bland and unimaginative, though that doesn't take anything away from the animation which, as you'd expect from a Pixar movie, is superb.<br /><br />The comedy, again as you would expect, is very witty and at times unusual but always funny. The bizarre traits of the animal characters dragged along for the ride are both genuine and hysterical, such as the typical dog traits for Dug, but fitted with a human voice amplifies those traits to a comically terrific level. The voice acting of all involved is, again spot on. Although not voiced by major names, the voices fit the characters well; from the loveable old man Carl voiced by Edward Asner, to the adorable Russell voiced by the young talent new on the scene, Jordan Nagai. One of the voices, I wish to point out for personal reasons really took me by surprise as I only realised who this man really was through simply browsing Wikipedia, and I was overjoyed to discover who this man was. Christopher Plummer was the voice of Carl's hero, Charles Muntz. Now the name may not ring any bells with most modern film fans, but to those fans of the old movies, especially fans of musical, The Sound of Music you will recognise this man as Captain Von Trapp himself. That's a little nerdy joy for me, so I hope you'll forgive me for getting a little carried away.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing bad I can say about this film. It's got originality to it that you see all the time with the Pixar outings, yet it keeps to the same old formula Disney has made famous since its creation, yet the mixing styles never get boring. Sure, to some the formulaic layout of the Disney movies may get a tad tedious, and they have even grated on me from time to time, but I adore the Disney/Pixar collaborations simply because they're fun and remind me of the simpler time when I was a kid. This is another strong outing from the team and I would strongly recommend it to all film fans of all ages, as there's something there for everyone.s I only realised who this man really was through simply browsing Wikipedia, and I was overjoyed to discover who this man was.

They story line is intriguing, characters are interesting and engaging, and overall they're a very enjoyable read. They're quite lengthy so if you're looking for a quick read, I might stay away from them, but if you enjoy books that are part of a series and like to follow characters as they develop and grow, I definitely recommend this for you.
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|I love Miyazaki.  Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa are two of my favorite films by him(and I can't wait for those to be on Blu-Ray).  However, Ponyo does not stand up to them in terms of story to me.  While I find the story to be only alright, the quality of the animation is wonderful.  Disney did a great job on the transfer.  I definitely recommend watching the Japanese audio version as I can't stand Noah Cyrus's voice as Ponyo.  Liam Neeson's voice also doesn't quite fit, but everyone else is cast well just like most of the dubs of Miyazaki's films in past years.  I highly recommend this film and blu-ray for parents with kids.    Movie:  3.5 stars  Blu-Ray:4.5 stars    I wish they left the Japanese DTS-HD audio track on here (-.5 stars)

I found myself browsing through the book to find out what was going to happen because I was getting bored. And about the story. I kinda liked the main characters but a vampire who is still a virgin at the age of 514? Combined with the explicit description of his thoughts and him having a erection all the time? I don't think so! And the whole vampire sex thing: not to plausible to me! And the teleporting, not really my thing! So I was a bit dissapointed. I didn't finish the book. I really hope the other books in the series are better, because I have bought them all :=(.

B001IF5YLQ|5.0|I purchased a cheap 3rd party adapter to use with my 17\\" MacBook Pro computer and a 23\\" Apple Cinema Display. The display worked for a few minutes and then went blank.     I then tried a 17 inch Samsung LCD which worked acceptably with the cheap adapter, but when I tried to calibrate it with a hardware calibrator, every profile was different. Apparently the monitor was not getting a consistent signal.    I assumed the MBP was defective, because the 23\\" monitor worked fine with my old computer, but after a lot of calls and troubleshooting I was persuaded to buy the Apple adapter to try. Wow, with the Apple adapter the 23\\" monitor works perfectly and profiles consistently.     It appears to me that this is clearly a case of \\"you get what you pay for.\\" I would especially recommend the Apple adapter to anyone who is concerned about critical color. I am amazed that the adapter could make such a difference, but it did.
0385341008|5.0|Juliet, the book's main character, writes \\"It was amazing to me then, and still is, that so many people who wander into bookshops don't really know what they're after--they only want to look around and hope to see a book that will strike their fancy. And then, being bright enough not to trust the publisher's blurb, they will ask the book clerk the three questions: (1) What is it about? (2) Have you read it? (3) Was it any good?<br />Real dyed-in-the-wool booksellers -- like Sophie and me -- can't lie. Our faces are always a dead giveaway. A lifted brow or curled lip reveals that it's a poor excuse for a book, and the clever customers ask for a recommendation instead, whereupon we frog-march them over to a particular volume and command them to read it. If they read it and despise it, they'll never come back. But if they like it, they're customers for life.\\"<br /><br />That is almost precisely how I came upon this little gem of a novel. I was at Barnes and Noble looking at [[ASIN:0345502833 The Wednesday Sisters: A Novel]] when I saw that the blurb on the back compared it to The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, which I did not care for, and so I asked the customer service rep if she'd read it. She hadn't, but recommended Guernsey to me instead. I am ever so grateful that she did.<br /><br />The cast of characters in this book are delightful. Their stories are both hilarious and harrowing. During WWII, German soldiers occupied the Channel Islands between England and France, Guernsey being one of them. I've read stories of people in the camps and of people on the home front but I never even thought about the people in occupied villages and towns. It was beautiful to read about how hope can survive even the bleakest of situations, how kindness can be found even from those amongst the enemy, and how life goes on after war.

I am just so tired of their pathetic attempts at humor.  They allll think they have something to say, and yet none of them will teach you a single solitary thing.<br /><br />This book was written by a woman who, from the very start, sounds nuts.  Divorced, on several mood-balancing drugs, manic, schizophrenic, she flies to Italy to live for a bit and \\"find herself\\" - learn Italian, etc.  You know the drill.

B000001FDI|5.0|Blind Faith's self-titled debut album (1969) was their ONLY album and was really an experiment by Eric Clapton.  Clapton had been part of Cream from 1966 to 1968.  After Cream broke up in 1968, Clapton assembled a new group consisting of himself on guitar, Steve Winwood (formerly of Traffic) on vocals, Ginger Baker (formerly of Cream) on drums, and Rick Grech on bass.<br /><br />This album contains just six songs, but all of them are good.  I can definitely hear a blending of Traffic and Cream on this album.  Songs such as Can't Find My Way Home, Sea Of Joy, Presence Of The Lord, and their cover of Buddy Holly's song Well All Right are still frequently played on the radio.  My favorite song is probably Had To Cry Today.<br /><br />This album has that distinctive '60s sound to it.  Released in 1969, it helped close out a great decade for music.  It's too bad that this was their one and only album.  Oh well, at least they released an album, and a good one.<br /><br />I highly recommend this classic album.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I got this album for Christmas and I was so excited! This was just what I wanted!<br /><br />Instead of buying both albums separately; just buy this one. :)<br /><br />The first CD, The Fame Monster, is GaGa's 2nd CD and each song talks about her fears of different monsters. In \\"Alejandro\\" and \\"Monster\\", she's talking about a boy/se* monster, in \\"Bad Romance\\" she talks about the press' interpretation of her as a se* addict, in \\"Telephone\\" she talks about her fear of suffocation, and in \\"Speechless\\" she reminds her fans they only get two parents.<br /><br />The second CD, The Fame, is her very first CD. She sings about being bisexual in \\"Poker Face\\" and about doing everything for the fame life in \\"The Fame\\".<br /><br />All of GaGa's songs can be interpreted in different ways for different people. That's what makes them unique.<br /><br />However, the cuss words are censored in these songs; which I'm sure is NOT the kind of thing GaGa wanted. I don't mind it as much, but remember that before you decide to buy it.

0545123267|3.0|I was kind of disappointed in this book. I felt like it was going to be the \\"Twilight\\" for werewolves but was not at all. It focused WAY too much on Grace's obsession with the wolves and not enough on her relationship with Sam. I also think it should of explored Sam's life more before he was bitten, along with the other wolves. The end of the book was where things started to finally get good, and then it was over. I'm hoping the 2nd book is better!
B0002DB52M|5.0|Suspend disbelief as you are drawn into this beautifully staged piece of cinematography. All the areas of your brain are triggering lightning bolts of neurological activity as your appreciation to the simplicity of it all focusses the receptors to each and every character. Real acting, real issues, small town nastiness and extreme tension simmers and keeps you riveted to your seat till the very end. When was the last time you experienced superb theatre from the comfort of your own armchair? This is a must see.

0805047905|5.0|It took just a little while for my daughter to warm up to this book. Then she loved it! I read it sort of like a song to her. In fact, this is the first book she tries to read herself & I can understand her! (She is 2 & 1/2)
0307463745|3.0|Finally, something disappointing from 37 Signals!    Getting Real was a very enjoyable, creative book. The 37S SVN blog is more of the same. Rework is EVEN MORE of the same. It would appear the authors have moved from creative-idea mode to milking the cash cow mode.    On the other hand, if you aren't aware of the 37S philosophy, it *is* worth learning about it. This book would be as good a way as any, unless you want to save money, in which case - just read the blog!
0810982862|5.0|I hadn't been so 'captured' by a movie since I saw the original Star Wars movie.  I lost count at 21 times I escaped my role in life by seeing that movie. I still have the original Art of Star Wars book: it had examples of story boards, conceptial enviromnets, characters and some commentary. I also have the Art of.. in a cardboard envelope with 'poster' pages of images drawn by the artist: imagine this: Luke Skywalker was a girl!!!. Any way, enjoy this beautiful compilation and wait for the $50 plus huge art book which is sure to be published in the future. It is what it is.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|A ordered the 2-Disc Collector's Edition of A Fish Called Wanda.  What a hoot!  I had a movie night with my husband, best friend and her husband (we had seen the movie together when it was first released) and our daughters in their late teens.  We all laughed out loud!  Jamie Lee Curtis is gorgeous, Kevin Kline is hysterical and John Cleese is just lovable.  The quality was very good.  I did not experience any problems at all with sound as a couple of people posted.  This I believe was the most recent re-release of the DVD.  I could have skipped the 2nd collector's DVD in the pack.  Some of it was entertaining, but very slow to watch.  Can't see that I would care to watch that part of it again.  I'm very happy to have the movie as part of my collection.  Absolutely recommend!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Ranks with the Passion of Joan of Arc as one of the greatest religious films ever made. This film is NOT the story of Jesus' life or ministry. If you want those, see another film. This is about experiencing the passion story. If you are a believer, you may \\"get it\\" immediately. But this is a film for viewers of any belief or none at all. Not to be converted or anything like that. Rather, Gibson's film is about experiencing the spiritual moment (filmaker and critic Paul Schrader calls it transcendental experience). The point is to make one feel not believe. You can make your own mind up about whether this is truth or fantasy. The Passion of the Christ puts you in the moment. Violent. Overwrought. Repellent. Operatic. Transcendent. It's all here. That's why this is one of the great films.
0321127420|4.0|The patterns in the Book are not new, they are known by any average coder with few yrs of exp. How ever the book is a very coherent collection of patterns and still (in 2010) remains very relevant. But the book can use little updating in few areas like with ASP.Net MVC - .Net now supports MVC, services both in Java and WCF etc.
B00151G08Y|5.0|A lot more vocals, much different from Hold Your Colour... and I love it. When a band expands its style without giving up an ounce of integrity, they're just fine with me. This album is gritty, it's rock, it's dance, it's just plain good. Making \\"The Tempest\\" the last song on the disc was a phenomenal decision... it makes the entire cd even more worth listening to.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|Reading these stories brings the atmosphere of 1880-90s London back as thick as the fog.  I thoroughly enjoyed the exploits of Holmes and Watson as they unravel the problems presented to the famous detective.  I feel as if I'm sitting in the drawing room on Baker Street warming by the fire with our heros as Watson and I observe Holmes' mind churning his inexorable logic until the solution presents itself.  The stories in this collection are among the best and most popular of the Holmes mysteries.  The Speckled Band and Orange Pips in particular are frequently rated near the top and are a delight at each reading.  These are classic detective stories at their best.  The stories are easy reading, yet well written, and bite-size for a quick mental snack.  The short stories are perfect for grabbing up and reading one or two while you are between appointments, although I found myself devouring the whole thing in a few sittings, not able to read just one.  I read these on my Kindle, with links to the beginning of each story, and well formatted.  The only exception to this is a problem displaying the British Pound symbol.  However, this does nothing to hinder one's understanding or reading experience.  I highly recommend this collection for any fan of the genre.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List was a story that took place in the 20th century during the Holocaust where6 million European Jews were murdered by the Nazi's under the leadership of Adolph Hitler, in Germany during WWII. Mr. Schindler ran a factory with Jew workers, making big profit. At the time of the concentration camps and Auschwitz, Schindler became attached and empathetic to the Jew workers. He paid for over 1,000 Jews to work in his new \\"factory\\" in order to save them from execution. The war ended and the 1,000 plus Jews were saved and free from oppression.    The movie began when the systematic oppression started with orders to make all Polish Jews to move into towns, where walled ghettos were created to confine them. The Jews were forced to wear a yellow or white badge with the Star of David on it to reveal their status. In the movie, they had the Jews lined up to be assigned their \\"new\\" jobs and one man was out-raged because he had a high education, but was only given menial labor. Near the end of the movie the women of Schindler's bought Jews, were transported to Auschwitz by accident. Auschwitz was one of the large-scale death camps that had been setup in 1942 to enforced Hitler's \\"final solution\\" - the total extermination of all Jews in Europe. Form the ghettos Jews were transported by cattle cars (which many suffocated to death) to the concentration camps. Schindler's List showed a main example of the over-crowding in the cars, with the people starving and thirsty in the heat. Schindler had pretended to make a joke of this by pretending to be cruel and having the cars hosed down with water. The Nazi officers considered this as Schindler giving the Jews false hope on purpose, when Schindler was really trying to early their suffering.  Schindler's List was a riveting movie that shows a horrible time in history up close. Most definitely a must see.

B002VPE1AM|4.0|Plot-wise, this movie is basically _The Last Samuri_ (or _Dances with Wolves_) with blue aliens and a dose of Deep Ecology. Surely not an original plot in any way but it's a plot that works (which it why it gets constantly re-hashed). The moralizing in the film wasn't ecaxtly subtle.    Visually, the movie was amazing. After seeing it on the big-screen, however, I think watching it on DVD would be a disappointment. If you missed your chance to see this in the theater, that's too bad; it was a treat. I guess a DVD is better than nothing.    Recommended.
B0035G9ABG|5.0|I was blown away by this new album.  Not only do I think it surpasses their self titled first album, but I think it even passes over Demon Days.  With Gorillaz you can always expect something new, which is what I love.  Their not going to give you the same recycled stuff that just sounds like their last album, their going to give you a completely new experience.  If you haven't listened to this album yet then what are you waiting for?

1400052173|1.0|HeLa cells may have commenced medicine's most complex and controversial ethical dilemmas.  This book could therefore have been an exploration of both historical and contemporary perspectives on the use of patient cells in medical research.  Regrettably, Rebecca Sloot merely summarizes these issues, choosing instead to dedicate a substantial portion of the book to quoting Henrietta Lacks's families personal struggles.  Although the family's circumstances were and are difficult, their challenges are neither unique nor a consequence of research on their mother's cells.  Further, although Ms. Sloot seems to desire to portray the family positively, she includes unnecessary details about them, often making them pitiable and even unlikeable.      Finally, Ms. Sloot's deplorable writing skills detract from the ability of this book to serve as either a biography of Henrietta and her family or as a history of the HeLa cells and their use in medical research.  Instead, the book is at best a catharsis for Ms. Sloot personally, terminating more than a decade of research and interviews.  Although this book fills a mere 300 pages, it is still too long, and feels like a high school student's attempt to meet a minimum word count.  Ms. Skloot may have tried admirably to obtain information to offer a biography of Henrietta and humanize the story of HeLa cells, but that information seems not to exist largely due to the brevity of Henrietta's life.  The story is much better suited for a feature magazine article.  Unfortunately for Ms. Sloot, that article was already published in Rolling Stone (as she mentions several times in the book) in the 1970s.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|Ordered this for my Grandson and  it is exactly what he wanted and is very happy with it.
1400032717|5.0|This is a wonderful book, and found myself turning to my Kindle every spare moment to see what would happen next.  Because it is written from the POV of a high functioning autistic teen, we get a very fresh view of the world and human interactions.  I highly recommend it.  I love detective novels, but this is truly unique.  A funny, touching and meaningful work, in addition to being a great read.  Having just babysat my 10-year-old autistic niece for three weeks, this book really gave me some insight into her quirky behavior.  Kudos to the author.
073510073X|5.0|My life has changed since I read this book.  Having been told for my entire life that I am \\"too sensitive\\" I was surprised and delighted to learn that being sensitive is a gift...YES, A GIFT!!!  Our society has a negative connotation to shyness or introversion, which is how sensitivity is sometimes diagnosed.  I wish my parents and teachers had read this book when I was growing up.  My self-esteem has actually risen, thanks to this wonderful author.  I teach young children, so sensitive children in my care will also benefit.
B0035G9ABQ|3.0|This album isn't as good as Demon Days, but it's not bad. It's missing some element that made songs like \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" and \\"Dare\\" really stand out to me on the previous album, and I seem to be missing that flow that ties the whole album together. However, it's still good in its own right, and I'm looking forward to seeing what Gorillaz does next.
B002X9W50E|4.0|I was so very fortunate to see this concert in St. Louis in 2004.  A few weeks after that concert David Bowie had a heart attack and has not recorded or toured since. I remember my younger brother and I went to the Fabulous Fox Theatre on May 11.  We met all of the band except David Bowie.  They put on a hell of a show and I have never forgotten it.  I have been a fan of David's since I was six year old( I'm now 40).  His concert lived up to my expectations and then some.  I was so glad to hear a lot of his newer material.  Certain albums such as Hours, Black Tie/White Noise, Never Let Me Down were not included in his set but I was pleasantly surprised to hear \\" All The Young Dudes\\" and one of my personal favorites \\" Fantastic Voyage\\".  He had so much energy and was downright chatty and funny with the fans at the  Fox.  I never had a quite a fun and exuberant concert experience until I saw David in 2004.  I wanted to re-live the excitement of that night so I had to purchase the concert.  I wasn't disappointed.  In fact there were a few new surprises for me.  I know that set lists change as tours go on.  I was glad to see and hear the changes on the DVD.  Would I recommend this concert DVD?  Yes, I am a Bowie fanatic and have several video copies of previous tours but this one is special because many fans view this as his last tour.  So being the sentimental fool that I am; I had to get it. I think many will find this enjoyable and is must have for us die hard fans.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|After seeing the thousands of great reviews I had to check this out. What I saw was a decent concept and the potential for strong stories and characters that, honestly could easily have been more than they were. One thing that bothered me were the many completely clichéd bad guys- evil corporate types and of course (welcome back to the '70s), anybody that promotes traditional values.  Also, the basic story lines of each show were extremely predicatable, things you've seen before in many other shows. Several of the main characters were either over the top or felt like they'd been drug out of the old TV Land toy chest, dressed up with new clothes and presented as something new.   I know, it's TV, what do you expect? If this would have come out in the 80's it would probably have been a huge hit. But there a few shows out there from it's time and now that make it look pretty cheesy. Battlestar Galactica is a good example.   Having said that, the much more realistic view of humanity a few hundred years from now was very refreshing and relatable compared to the utopian fantasy that shows like Star Trek portray. Yes it would be nice if nobody needed money and people were so loving that we all just sought to better our minds. But thousands of years of human history prove that isn't going to happen in another thousand years, much less in 300-500.   Even though I complained a lot, this series was good enough for me to want to watch the whole box set. Now it'll make a good gift at the next office Christmas party.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Being a long-time fan of Michael Jackson I had mixed feelings about watching his performances in the months leading up to his death.  I was tremendously pleased to find that I would not be disappointed with This Is It.  The DVD showcases his professionalism and attention to detail for which he was famous.  It was nothing short of remarkable that his dance moves equaled performers that probably were not yet born when he was at the height of his career.  I give This Is It the highest rating because I believe that it deserves it.  True Michael Jackson fans will want to own this DVD.[[ASIN:B002V4PPRQ Michael Jackson (This Is It) Music Poster Print - 22\\" X 34\\"]].

B003B13QQU|3.0|Goldfrapp's Head First advances from the late 70's electronic and ambient experimental period to the early 80's when everyone with access to a synthesizer was trying to break into music.  While Allison's Goldfrapp's alternately sultry and ethereal voice elevates this from the average 80's reincarnation, Head First is nowhere as deep as Felt Mountain, as sexy as Black Cherry, as danceable as Supernature or as relaxed as Seventh Tree.  Its just good retro pop music.  Better than most, but not up to the high standards set by Goldfrapp's earlier albums.
159562015X|3.0|I loved the Now Discover Your Strengths because it gave great feedback, advice and overall suggestions. The Strengthsfinder 2.0 basically reiterated everything discussed in the first book.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|The Ka-Bar Becker Campanion is a sweet knife; no doubt about it.  I have owned it for a couple months and have had it on a three day backpacking trip through the Superstition Wilderness here in AZ, though I must say, it's a little heavy for backpacking; especially if you are one of those ultra-light guys.  It weighs almost a pound.  The upside of this is you can use it like a hatchet.      It doesn't have a great, controlled feel.  The handle is too large and the blade is extremely thick and heavy, so it's not great for fine, intricate things.  This knife is perfect for chopping wood, slicing through canvas, cutting up kindling, or even splitting logs; all of which I have done.  The only thing I haven't used it for that I would love to test is cleaning an animal.    The blade came out of the box in terrible shape.  It was dull, uneven, and even rolled in some spots.  After some time on a whetstone however, it was awesome!  It cut though sinewy roast beef like butter. (literally)  The edge retention seemed to be good too.  My friend (who apparently doesn't know anything about knives) was scraping dirt off of a rock with it, until I saw what was happening and gave him a good yelling.  Then later he used it to start a fire with some flint and magnesium, directly cutting with the edge of the blade.  Even after all that (plus a lot more) it was still sharp enough to cut all of our finest kindling and even slice my finger. (You may be thinking at this point that we were the most inexperienced backpackers ever.  Well that's irrelevant to this review.)    In summary, if you want a heavy, indestructible chopping knife then this is it.  If you want something light and precise, look elsewhere.  Also, buy a sharpener before it gets to you in the mail since apparently Ka-Bar has no idea how to sharpen a knife.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Every time I see this movie, I want to protect this girl.  Of course, later on, she proves that she doesn't need protecting.  She needs to be protected FROM.  I've had to endure my share of bullying in my day, so I can very easily sympathize with her.  I put a stop to it by wrestling in high school.  Never had to wrestle my tormentors because when I started wrestling, the tormenting stopped.  But something about Carrie just tugs at the heartstrings.  Poor girl never had a chance.  Personally, I don't think she was aware of what she was doing when she created all that mischief and mayhem.  She had just decided she'd had enough and something snapped.  Carrie going on the rampage was sort of akin to a dam bursting.  Once it bursts, you can't call back the irrevocable.  Also, according to the book, she didn't kill Tommy Ross.  He was killed instantly when the bucket hit him on the head.  In fact, if you look closely, you see Carrie trying to catch him as he's falling before she goes into a rage.  And I believe the sign that read CARRIE WHITE BURNS IN HELL FOR HER SINS isn't necessarily telling us she went to hell.  I think this is just another example of the town's meanness, trying to get in one last cheap shot at her.  Someone who deserved a better continuation of life, but that's Stephen King for you.  Life isn't all happy endings, and I think that, if anything is the true horror of this story.  And the movie told the story surprisingly well.  Four out of five.
B000063WDH|5.0|My first foray into the The Black Keys won't be my last.  Unlike all the pretenders out there (North Mississippi Allstars come to mind) these guys are the REAL DEAL.  I have well over a hundred blues CDs & this one jumps right into the top 15% of that stack.  Love the \\"Do The Rump\\" cover; Junior Kimbrough would've been proud.  I'm not sure how you follow up a debut like this, but I'm going to find out real soon.  Send the wife & kiddies out shopping, then crank this up like you were still in college - this ain't no ear-bud music, this is big speaker, glass rattlin' stuff.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban has such a remarkable voice. His talent shines through with every word he sings, and every note he strums on his guitar. The words roll off his tongue so clear and crisp, and you can't help but want to rush out and buy his album. He brings something new to the world of country music that no one has ever quite seen before.    His style of music is like nothing you've ever heard before. He's definitely not your average country singer. Instead of going on with a southern drawl, he has a much clearer voice. His songs are full of love, and passion, not bars and cars. Keith Urban has certainly taken things to the next level.    It's very surprising how incredible this country singer is considering he grew up in Australia. You don't even notice his accent when he's singing. His songs flow from his heart about where he is now with his marriage, daughter, and earlier days. Each song has a beautiful message within it.     If you haven't bought this album yet you need to. You wont regret it, and you'll probably be listening to him everyday for the next year. I can't wait until his next album comes out, because I'm sure it will be even better than this one. It will be hard to top Defying Gravity, but I'm sure he will.
B0024FAR5M|1.0|Wow I can't believe the rave reviews for this series. I just started watching so maybe it gets better. Where do I begin, terrible writing, bad acting and boring characters (especially any scene with Katie Segal or Ron Perlman) the main guy Jax is dull as dishwater. Why does any series on FX, HBO, Showtime or AMC that is full of violence, bad language and weird characters get rave reviews? It still takes good acting and writing to make a good series. Sons has none of these. IMHO

0920668372|2.0|Hmmm...after hearing so much buzz about this book I purchased it for our home library.  After reading it once it promptly found itself back on the shelf...I was not such a fan.  It has a very sweet and tender message but I could not get past some of the subject matter.  It was not exactly appropriate bedtime reading for my 3.5 year olds.  I did a full review of this book on my website [...].  Feel free to check it out and leave some feedback.
1439190275|5.0|Overweight, high blood pressure and borderline high blood sugar told me I was in trouble.  I got this book, read it immediately, and started right in after stocking my kitchen with veggies, meats, poultry, dairy, etc.  In two weeks I was down eight pounds, my blood pressure was back to normal range and my recent blood work shows everything at normal levels.  My doctor was astounded and asked me what I was doing!  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to get healthy, and will stay committed to the Atkins way of eating.  Yes, I still have to use discipline and self control when it comes to tempting sweets but I think I always will.  Years of bad eating habits are hard to break but Atkins makes it worth it!  I enjoyed that the book was easy to read and explained all the concepts so clearly.  When you realize how great you feel and how much energy you have, I just can't go back to the old ways of eating - ever again!

1594488878|5.0|My habit is to alternate reading a novel and then something non-fiction.  I am always slightly happier when reading the novel.  Juliet, Naked was finished so fast I felt cheated.  Read in one day and spent the whole time stitched in belly laughs.  Classic Nick Hornby; some music, some wistfulness, some romance, some realism and lots of great context so that the funny line hits you just right.  Great characters and just the right amount of sweet and sour.  Loved it.
B002V0WN2K|3.0|I have everything this band has ever done, so it pains me to give this only three stars. There are just too many mediocre songs on here. Three stars means there are more good songs than bad, but still I was a little disappointed with this one.
B0000033IS|5.0|A beautiful early recording from the lady of soul. Smooth and silky all the way. Just lay back and let the smooth silky vocals wash away the tensions. She has a voice that is strong but smooth. She has never realy recorded such a timeless album since. Buy it and get emersed in the rich and wonderful sound that only Aretha can deliver.
0525421580|5.0|I am, in general, not a fan of young adult novels. They are not unlike teen movies in that most of them seem condescending, pandering and, above all, shallow.  But, as with teen movies, there are exceptions.    Will Grayson, Will Grayson is one of them.    Told through two vastly different and very real lenses, the story of two adolescent Will Graysons is deeply funny, touching, and relevant.  The thoughts and experiences of the title characters send the reader right into the heart of what friendship, honesty and love are.  The authors skillfully bring the reader back and forth between love and depression, denial and anger, sexuality and friendship, Will and Will.  The plot is intriguing but realistic, and the ending is satisfying (though it left me wanting more).    Most importantly, this book matters as you read it.  I for one laughed our loud and swelled with happiness. I gasped with the gut-wrenching pain that comes when the truth you cling to is revealed to be a lie.  The miracle of the book is something few writers can accomplish: as a reader, the characters and the events unfolding were very important to me.  It is so masterfully written that I cared deeply.    The other miracle is the hilarious musical numbers.
B003539QKO|1.0|Straight up awful except for \\"Drop the World.\\" I'm tempted to delete everything except for that single from my hard drive. I feel cheated.    I'd describe myself as more of a rock fan who also likes hip-hop, not the other way around, but I've always liked Lil Wayne. Unfortunately the guy needs to stick to what he does best. He's not a terrible guitar player but he does write terrible rock songs. I bought the album on the strength of \\"Drop the World\\" and was disappointed that the rest didn't hold up to the single.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I had zero hopes that this movie would be worth seeing since it had been hyped so much and in that regard I wasn't let down since the movie was in fact pretty bad.<br /><br />The special effects were amazing. Visually it was a beautiful film. I especially loved the glowing lichen in the forest.<br /><br />Other than that the movie was boring, predictable and lame. The story line was unoriginal and uninspired. Most of the acting was horribly sub-par and the dialog was just terrible.<br /><br />I guess if all you want is some eye-candy then this is the movie for you - but if you are looking for a deeper story or character development or any kind of originality in anything but the visuals - I say don't watch this.
B00338QELU|1.0|written in an unusual and choppy order this novel was less than enthralling...more concerned with being &#34;global&#34; than providing a coherant narrative.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|When I first read about this album coming out, I was extremely excited. Slash is one of my all-time favorite guitarists. I was just concerned that this might be just some sort of money making venture. But after listening to the album, fear not. This is vintage Slash combined with the various talents of his \\"guests.\\" The one song which surprised me was the collaboration with Fergie (Beautiful Dangerous). I just didn't know what to expect. But that song rocks, and has a kick a.s.s. solo to boot. I also like the song with Ian Atsbury (Ghost), being that I was a big Cult fan. The opening riff had me hooked instantly, and is a good opening song. Ozzy Osbourne never disappoints (Crucify the Dead). I especially like the Lemmy Kilmeister song (Doctor Alibi) even though I'm not a big Motorhead fan.      Every song has something to like, and the instrumental \\"Watch This\\" with Dave Grohl on drums and Duff McKagan on bass is really quite awesome. There are some definite radio staples on here, but it doesn't take away from the Rock N Roll spirit of the album. I also get a \\"summertime\\" feel from the album, and I'm quite sure I'll be listening to it throughout the whole summer.    Highly recommended
B002ZFQD04|5.0|The \\"Sticky and Sweet Tour\\" (SST) CD/DVD was released here in the Philippines on March 30, a week ahead of the April 6 US release. Even if I had long pre-ordered a copy on Amazon, I still bought a copy just so I could own it and be one of the first ones to see her best-selling concert tour immortalized on DVD. This DVD was simply AMAZING! Madonna at her utmost BEST! I am not a bit surprised that SST became the most successful tour ever by a solo artist. The show is FUN and VERY ENTERTAINING and that is what GREAT shows should be. I liked this show more than her last 2 - \\"Confessions Tour\\" (which had some really boring portions in her desire to inject some relevance) and the \\"Reinvention Tour\\"(the dvd was more of a docu and didn't show the whole concert). This concert ranks among Madonna's top 3 best shows alongside \\"The Virgin Tour\\" and \\"Who's That Girl Tour\\" which were 2 of her earliest shows. I also liked \\"Girlie Show\\" and \\"Drowned World Tour.\\"    What makes this particular show great is the fact that it was performed in Buenos Aires, Argentina and the Argentines simply ADORED her. If there could be an award for BEST AUDIENCE, I would give it to the Argentines based on this show. You could feel the infectious energy, love and warmth they gave back to Madge during the whole show - singing with her, dancing with her, applauding her every number and even singing \\"Like A Virgin\\" acapella with her towards the end of the show where they knew all the lyrics. The \\"You Must Love Me\\" and \\"Don't Cry for me Argentina\\" portion (\\"Don't Cry\\" was especially included for the Argentina concert) was wonderful and memorable and dedicated to them since these two songs were sung in Madonna's award-winning film \\"Evita\\" about Argentina's famous first lady Eva Peron. Madonna's vocals were solid and remarkable. She has never sounded better live singing these stunning ballads! I was so proud of Madonna as we watched the DVD with my family in our home theater. Her voice has improved with age!    My favorite part of the show was the Vogue medley where the song \\"Vogue\\" is sung live amidst fantastic choreography. The song is even interspersed with parts of \\"4 Minutes\\" which was such a creative idea. I also loved the rock version of \\"Borderline,\\" (after all these years, the song still sounds current),\\"She's not me\\" where she confronts her own images (really fun - you could hear the audience reacting), \\"Miles Away\\" which she dedicated to her loving audience, and the \\"La Isla Bonita\\" portion which is so colorful and festive. Of course, the usual show-stoppers were given fresh treatment like \\"Into the Groove,\\" \\"Music,\\" \\"Like A Prayer,\\" \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Hung Up,\\" and the finale \\"Give it to me,\\" which was surprisingly so well-received by the audience. I had misgivings about the impact of this song since it was largely ignored in her home country but the audience loved this very danceable song nevertheless.     No one dances like Madonna and no one performs like the Queen. All these wannabe divas should learn a thing or two from the Queen on how to be a great performer. She has endurance, energy and attitude. And Madonna has never looked her best than in this concert. Very sexy, very beautiful! Fantastic performer! It is obvious she loves performing and the love she gives to her audience is just returned to her. After more than 25 years, Madonna is still on top because she loves her craft and she is rewarded in return with a music career that is the benchmark of other female performers. Truly a music icon! Her contemporaries in the 80s have been relegated to oblivion because fame is fleeting but Madonna is still there - current and relevant to popular music because she constantly reinvents herself so as not to sound the same and look boringly the same. The upcoming Glee episode (April 20) featuring Madonna classics is much-awaited and her upcoming cd is much-anticipated. Hail to the Queen! Please get a copy of this wonderful CD/DVD and you will not regret plowing in your hard-earned money. It is worth every cent. Make Her Madgesty No. 1 again !!!
030726999X|4.0|Stieg Larsson's trilogy, \\"The Girl. . .\\" culminates with this volume, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\" In the previous two books, Lisbeth Salander fought against the forces of evil like a Superwoman of vengeance.  In this installment, Lisbeth is comatose, fighting for her life, and if she should recover, she will be put on trial for three murders.<br /><br />How does she fight when she's unconscious?<br /><br />Luckily, she has her loyal friend Mikael Blomkvist to help uncover the plots against her even before she is capable of fighting back for herself.<br /><br />Through corruption and horrific abuse, Lisbeth has survived.  Will she live now and, if so, exact revenge with every odd against her? This question forms the conspiracy of wills in this last novel of the trilogy.<br /><br />Larsson's political agenda against extremist organizations and demonic government officials is as much a part of the plot as his carefully drawn characters.<br /><br />Without reiterating the stunning twists, turns, and clever retribution, I give this book 4 stars rather than 5 because of the amount of exposition needed to get new readers up to speed on the previous 1000 pages they have not read and the flatness of the verb tenses in parts.<br /><br />This is a long and winding road.  I suggest readers begin with the first volume, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" move on to \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" and then finish with \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.\\"  With the other books fresh in your mind, you can skim the first 100 pages of this volume.  Larsson differs from American spy-thriller books Richard North Patterson and Tom Clancy in the complexity of his plot (and the names his characters carry).  Larsson's work is unique in his willingness to assume his reader's intelligence and perseverance through the details.  And now we are left to contemplate in silence as this amazing literary voice died in 2004.
B001N26GFM|5.0|I originally got this film because I had seen the excellent actor rupert friend in THE YOUNG VICTORIA and i read that he had played a role as a Nazi soldier in this film...... this film is the poignant story of the German officer's son who was told not to go through the forest and of course he did so and found an \\"encampment\\" surrounded by barbed wire and a boy around his age on the other side of the fence. The boy behind the fence is wearing striped pajamas and tells him that the soldiers took his other clothes so he has to wear pajamas now.....a friendship ensues..............THIS FILM IS A \\"MUST SEE\\" ABSOLUTELY!!!!!!!!
006176759X|4.0|Well haven't read it yet. Other than that everything seems to be ok condition and stuff. Just took a lil long to receive(shipping).
B00275EGWY|5.0|This film avoids the trap of making glib political statements about the Iraq war (it is surely too recent history to know its full significance yet). Instead it focuses on the daily lives of a taught squadron of bomb disposal experts who patrol the dusty Baghdad streets and dry desert scapes searching for and diffusing the ramshackle bombs put in place by insurgents trying to sabbotage the US reconstruction efforts.<br /><br />The drama weaves closely into the lives of the men, dominated by Sargeant William James, a curiously eager soldier who recklessly seeks out dangerous bomb situations, often failing to heed the warnings of his colleagues.<br /><br />The plot is taught, not in a synthetic Hollywood way with tension artificially built in leading to some carefully contrived denoument, but in a realistic, frustrating flatlining way. The days tick down to the end of the bomb squad's tour of duty, and the heat, relentless opposition from guerilla insurgents and cruelty (in one memorable scene, insurgents use the corpse of a small boy to conceal explosives) all take their toll on the men. They quarrel, gossip, banter and fight. The narrative in a way flatlines, replicating the true situation in Iraq where it was (still is) very difficult to tell what sort of impact and progress is being made.<br /><br />But the comradeship between the men is real, and this is developed in the film through touching scenes, such as James supplying an exhausted colleague (and rival) with water after he has been staring out at insurgents in the desert heat for hours.<br /><br />Realistic cinematography, with a good mix of panoramic shots and action close ups. It is a skilled, intelligent and moving film. well deserving of its accolades. The final twist is not gimmicky, but rather reflects the addictive effect that war has on some people, providing a tension and purpose that far suppasses anything in ordinary suburban life.<br /><br />Well done to everyone involved in the making of this film.
030726999X|5.0|The final installment of the Salander saga takes a while to get going, but when it finally does, it flies.  I'm so glad I was able to read the last third of this book without interruption because it was a breathtaking downhill race.<br /><br />As Lisbeth Salander lies incommunicado and under arrest in the hospital, things in the outside world are taking odd turns.  Berger has left Millenium Magazine to take a job as managing editor of a large daily newspaper, though from the resistance she's getting from both management and staff she can't understand why she was offered the job--not to mention she's being cyber-stalked.  Blomkvist is marshalling Lisbeth's defense and writing a book about the terrible abuses she's suffered at the hands of the bureaucracy though he's able to take a break now and then to enjoy the company of a new flame.  Lisbeth's hacker pals rally to uncover evidence that will ensure her aquittal when she goes to trial and dark forces are gathering to make sure she's convicted.<br /><br />With so many plotlines to set up, the aptly named The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest spends a lot of pages and ink on backstories and laying the foundation for the wild ride that is the last half of the book.  It's worth trudging through the first half because Larsson does not let the reader down.  As Lisbeth's defense comes together with assistance from the most unlikely of sources, her gift for inspiring loyalty has never been more critical nor more rewarded as a conspiracy is uncovered that reaches high into the Swedish government. When it comes, the ending is exactly right for the imperfect characters we now have relationships with.<br /><br />I finished this book last night and felt sad that I'll never have another opportunity to finish a new Stieg Larsson.  His particular brand of alchemy in creating engrossing events happening to vivid yet credible characters is unique in any language. Literature is the poorer for his loss.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|In a world where it feels like divisions are more pronounced than ever, this story reminds us we are all the same.  That who we were is not always who we are.  That revisiting long forgotten relationships can have the best and most inspiring and fulfilling consequences.  I simply loved this book.
B002VECMAE|4.0|What a great cast...Kevin Spacey as the serpent in the garden, Jeff Bridges as a hippie Army instructor, Ewan MacGregor as a journalist, and George Clooney as a former student of Bridges' who is still trying to hone his psychic skills.    I'm curious to know just how much of this was true.      Apparently, there was some attempt to create a new kind of U.S. Army, as well as many attempts at a psychic unit within the Army.  They could supposedly stop an animal's heart, do some remote viewing, locate people without much to go on, predict coin tosses, etc.  Bridges trains Clooney and others in these skills, and then things fall apart.  Later, MacGregor and Clooney are in Iraq, and Clooney is convinced that he is dying of cancer due to a death touch inflicted years earlier, though as his pal says, it could be a broken heart.  Something he had believed in so much is now in shreds.    The ending of the film leaves one wondering how many of these people actually existed, whether any part of the program is still being used, if the part at the end with MacG and the wall is supposed to be a metaphor, and what became of the other people.   This would have given me somewhat more satisfaction.
006112429X|5.0|What an interesting, disturbing, yet thought provoking book. The ending totally caught me by surprise. I love all Lionel's books.

B0029XFN8A|2.0|This review refers to the BLU-RAY edition ONLY and NOT to the DVD edition.    Well having The Girl Next Door on DVD and loving them and having recently upgraded to a blu-ray player I decided to take the plunge and upgrade my collection to high definition blu-ray format.    Boy, what a mistake that was.    Picture quality is AWFUL - well awful for blu-ray anyway. They've taken the same standard definition source as the DVD and upscaled it for blu-ray - but it's still standard definition. Only the menu is in High Definition, the movie is not. I tested my DVD version upscaled against the blu-ray edition and found them identical - if anything the DVD came out slightly on top.    My verdict if you're thinking of buying The Girl Next Door in blu-ray and you have an upscaling DVD/BD player - forget it. Stick with the DVD version instead, picture is the same and it's cheaper too.    Maybe one day this wonderful movie will receive the treatment it deserves and be digitally remastered and have it's frames scanned with a high definition camera - but until then sit on your DVD's and wait.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|I am not a fan of movies in which the main character spends the whole film with a flat affect on his face, such as the one Will Ferrell wears here throughout. It gets a little dull. I grew antsy almost from the beginning here, when the storyline becomes apparent. Though seemingly original, I wasn't particularly entertained by it. Dustin Hoffman is again wasted, as he was in \\"I Love Huckabees.\\" This is a supposed comedy, but there are no real laughs, perhaps just a smirk now and then. It's also a bit long. I had to pause it several times to get through it because it's just not that compelling.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Love this show and these dvd's. I can never get enough supernatural. characters are convincing, script is well written, effects are great. I think its one of the best storylines I have ever seen of any show on tv. Season 5 is currently airing, its intense. so buy this and catch up!
1594150818|3.0|It's a very good book. But, I was buying it as an engagement gift. The large print makes the book look very cheap. It may be OK if I am keeping it myself. But, as a gift, it is bad.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|\\"2012.\\" Hmmmmm. The Mayans predicted a cataclysmic end to the Earth in 2012 and so it happens. As literary critic, Samuel Taylor Coleridge coined a consequently oft-used phrase concerning a work of fiction. Is it so constructed and made plausible that a reader is willing to suspend disbelief of any extraordinary elements? For this work of fiction/film, I could not, even though John Cusack, who usually lends credence to a celluloid story, is the lead actor. \\"2012\\" is not even close to that suspension, much less a \\"willing\\" suspension!<br /><br />Early on I found myself saying, \\"Yeah, right,\\" over and over, as one incredible--NOT credible--thing after another happened! If the director had allowed Cusack and his family to escape one, two, even three huge disasters, I could have suspended. I might note that I am an easy suspender of disbelief if the director gives me something to work with. But here, Cusack and family miss all disasters, one after another. They miss crashing multiple times, miss falling into abysses multiple times, miss being burned up multiple times, and so on, until the viewer just accepts that disbelief is not the issue here-- the end of the world is. That's where the director succeeds in building concern for this family and willingness to accept that this is the end of the world, after all, and rules don't apply. Besides, I wanted to know how the story ends.<br /><br />I also have a problem with the ending, but first here are various other aspects I find troubling:<br /><br />1. Cusack seems to be the only person who can outrun catacylsmic earthquakes, boiling, roiling fires, exploding roadways and bridges, and falling buildings. Why Cusack? Why this family? The only apparent answer is that he wrote this book about Atlantis (I was in the kitchen when this part was shown so I'm not sure I have it exactly right), as if this book foreshadows the earth's end.<br /><br />2. The earth ends and there's no mention of God? Mayans accurately predict the end? The Bible makes it clear that no one knows the day or the hour. Actually, self-reliant humanists should love this part!<br /><br />3. Danny Glover as President of the United States? He has played so many villains as of late that I expected his every next word to reveal a villainous president!<br /><br />4. A certain family member is eliminated--well, that's all I can say about this one to avoid spoilers, but trust me on this one--it's just too convenient.<br /><br />5. Only the best of the best are picked to be \\"saved.\\" Thomas Jefferson might approve of that plan, but my friend GB would have an apoplectic stroke!<br /><br />5. The ending is both troubling and totally surprising, a plus. I cannot say more to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />\\"2012\\" is almost totally unbelievable, yet I enjoyed it. I had to know the end and was pleasantly surprised that this ending is actually believable!one knows the day or the hour. Actually, self-reliant humanists should love this part!    3.

B0024FADAQ|5.0|1. Catherine Mary Stewart was so babetacular.  2. The director/writer/producers pioneered CGI (computer generated imagery). It was the first feature film to use CGI as simulated reality (only other movie was TRON, which was set in an unreal, simplified world, so not as significant). They used a Cray X-MP supercomputer and were writing the software at the same time as producing the frames.    TRIVIA: Centauri's StarCar was also a real functional prop and was reused in Back to the Future II.
B002RAREAK|1.0|Let me just say that I was totally NOT expecting this cd to be crap at all, especially since hearing \\"There Goes My Baby\\", \\"Lil Freak\\", and \\"Daddy's Home\\" on the radio. I love those songs.  After those songs everything is completely juvenile and annoying. \\"OMG\\", \\"Monstar\\" and \\"So Many Girls\\" are just ridiculously stupid. The ones that are good are \\"Making Love (Into The Night) and \\"Mars Vs. Venus\\" Those are classic Usher songs. This cd reminds of his last effort \\"Here I Stand\\" with only a few worthy songs and the rest is crap.    I really hope Usher would just take a break like Beyonce should do because there music has just gone so far downhill. Inspiring and quality are no longer the key anymore, but radio play is what matters and thats unfortunate.
1883217040|5.0|I'm primarily a guitarist, I learned to play blues by ear many years ago. But, as I grew more interested in playing jazz, it became clear that there were gaps in my knowledge that I wasn't going to get around by relying on my ear. This book has done an excellent job addressing those gaps.<br /><br />It was not an easy book to get through. I don't have easy access to a piano, so playing many of the examples on the guitar didn't get the point across completely. Also, piano voicings and guitar voicings aren't ever going to match up completely. But, it was still a valuable experience. At some point I would like to go through the book again with a piano in front of me. In fact, I didn't absorb everything the first time through, I will no doubt read the book again anyway to pick up some of the loose ends.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book was the section on blues scales, things that I was familiar with. He was able to tie my understanding of the blues to a better understanding of jazz. I think I'll be a better blues player because of it.<br /><br />I don't read standard music notation very well. I've seen some reviews where the use of standard notation was said to be a shortcoming of the book. I disagree. If you want to play jazz, learn to read music.<br /><br />It's a challenging read, but worth all of the effort that I put into it. I expect it to also act as a long-term reference. If anything ever happens to it, I'll buy another copy.
0061730327|5.0|William Kamkwamba grows up in a village in rural Malawi where people still believe in the power of magic and access to learning is very limited. William's father is a farmer, entirely dependent on the seasonal rains to grow the crops to feed his family. When a devastating drought and famine strike Malawi in 2002 the crops fail and the family barely scrapes together enough food to survive until the next planting season, getting by on one meal a day of corn husks and pumpkin leaves. There is no money to send William to school, and he must drop out. To fill his time William begins frequenting a nearby library, really just a few shelves of random donated books from other countries. One of the books he finds there, however, changes William's life. The book Using Energy sparks William's mind and excites his imagination about the amazing world of electricity. He uses this knowledge to plan a windmill to generate electricity for his home which is only lit by kerosene lanterns, and to pump water from a well to irrigate his father's fields so the family will not have to face the prospect of a killing famine ever again.  Having no money and few resources, William scrounges parts for his windmill from rusted bicycles, broken tractors, and other abandoned machinery he finds in and around his village. He has very few tools and must improvise every step of the way. The villagers mock William, but he pays them no mind as his windmill project comes together and slowly climbs towards the sky.<br /><br />This inspiring true story left me marveling about what may be accomplished through little more than determination, inventiveness, and a hard-working, curious mind. Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Sample Line:  \\"On the weekends, I walked the old city and learned about its buildings, many of them built by hand more than four hundred years ago without the kind of modern technology we have today. Seeing this, it gave me even more confidence that we Africans can develop our continent if we just put our minds and abundant resources together and stop waiting on others to do it for us.\\"nds and abundant resources together and stop waiting on others to do it for us.\\"

B000002UKS|5.0|Like capturing lightning in a bottle, so is the second album from Foo Fighters, \\"The Colour and the Shape.\\" While the band would go on to enjoy longevity not only commercially but creatively as well, there's just something special -- no, magical -- about this album. Not only did it spawn a respectable amount of hit-singles such as \\"My Hero\\" and \\"Everlong\\" which still live on today, but it blew away any and all expectations following the first [[ASIN:B0000CAXID self-titled]] album, which was more of a collection of demos than it was a fully conceived album by a full-fledged band.<br /><br />Shedding off any and all comparisons to Grohl's previous day-job, the band (which would be completed by adding drummer Taylor Hawkins shortly after the recording of the album) truly come into their own on this album with assistance from producer Gil Norton. The dynamics on this album are off-the-wall, from the quiet intro of \\"Doll\\" ripping into the full-on rock-out that is \\"Monkey Wrench\\" to ballads like \\"Walking After You\\" and \\"February Stars\\" which verge on being, for lack of a better term, pretty. Perhaps the album's penultimate song, \\"Everlong,\\" is a song that is worth purchasing the album for alone. Easily one of the Foos' grandest achievements, it's an emotionally charged ballad that finds Grohl at his most stripped and vulnerable, which says a lot, seeing as how this is an album that, in and of itself, is based on the dissolution of his own marriage.<br /><br />As one of the few alternative rock albums in its time that hasn't become dated, \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" has more than earned its rightful place as a bonafide modern classic and the moment that Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters name stepped out of Kurt Cobain's shadow. It is, hands down, one of the best rock records of the 90's and no collection could be complete without it. Not a single song is bad, not a single note is wasted. Don't be surprised if you find yourself putting it on repeat more often than not.
B000UD08HW|1.0|I just got my DVD in today and I tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, I have tried it in my DVD player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, I got robbed.<br />If there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star.
0307388840|1.0|I've read about a third of this book, and I can't understand all the positive reviews. The author uses many words to say very little; it's all exposition with very little dialogue in the entire book (I flipped through, thinking there had to be more dialogue coming up). I'm not pulled into the plot nor do I feel any attachment to any character, not even Briony. I had high hopes for the book. The summary read very interesting, but I'm giving the rest of it a miss and moving on.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|When my wife and I married almost 15 years ago, I became more acquainted with very unique world that is New Orleans -- particularly the food. I had not seen very many flattering portrayals of the city in movies and TV (Live and Let Die springs to mind) but it is truly an amazing city with lots of rich history, wonderful people and did I mention food?<br /><br />Food figures prominently in The Princess and the Frog, since Tiana, the lead character, dreams of opening a great restaurant and fulfilling the wishes of her father. There are more than a few scenes devoted to cooking and cuisine. One scene in particular uses the proper dicing of vegetables for gumbo as a way to bond Tiana and Prince Naveen.<br /><br />Music is also a core component to both the city and the film and Randy Newman delivered a full \\"book\\" score that touches each musical style of the region and add much-needed songs to the recent Disney catalog. My particular favorite is \\"My Evangeline,\\" a stunningly beautiful ballad sensitively sung by the amazing Jim Cummings (also the voice of Pooh, Tigger, Darkwing Duck and many others). By the way, every speaking actor also sings his or her songs.<br /><br />There have been those who have expressed comments about what The Princess and the Frog is not, rather that what it is. Perhaps the hopes for Disney's return to hand-drawn animation created overly high expectations, but it's wonderful to see this style executed in such exquisite, classic style. I think it will hold up to the test of time and become a Disney staple.<br /><br />Don't miss the audio commentary by the directors because they are very generous in their background information as well as generous in giving credit to those involved in the film. It's interesting to note their story about how, when faced with creating an animated feature after the division was all but shuttered, were looking for animation desks and were led to a secret \\"stash\\" collected by Christopher (son of Disney Legend Winston) Hibler -- somehow he knew they would be needed.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray not only offers a more detailed and brilliant image and sound, but there almost a dozen features there that are not included on the regular DVD.

B000J10EQU|4.0|Please note I saw this movie on TV so I can't speak to the quality of the video transfer or its features.<br /><br />This is a beautiful and artfully filmed version of the Superman story. The strong cast is excellent, and the special effects truly breathtaking. The city of Metropolis is spectacular, and almost every scene and backdrop equally spectacular. The main problem (and a minor one, since the rest of the movie is so strong) is that the movie has very little that's new, most of the plot and the themes being borrowed from the original.  Some of the relationship dynamics falls flat (there was no chemistry between Superman and Lois, for one thing). Routh does look a bit like Reeve, and both he and Spacey are excellent in the lead roles, and the supporting cast is good, too, with Parker Posey getting many of the funniest lines. And speaking of humor, the campy humor is well done also. I just wish there had been more original material that was different from the first flick. Overall, though, still an enjoyable film and worth seeing just for the beautiful cinematography and special effects. And speaking of special effects--and last but not least--the scenes of superman flying are more realistic and more believable than ever.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and I bought this one as a gift for a friend. The characters and quirky story line present a poetic and humorous look at the basic human complexity that connects us all. It is inspiring in its ability to emphasize our similarities in spite of apparent differences.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|The first time I watched The Informant I was mildly entertained and amused, which was more than I expected.  The second time I watched The Informant, 24 hours later, I found it to be hilarious.  If it were not based on a true story, and if I were not from mid-western Illinois, and if I had not personally done business with ADM in the past, then I don't know if it would have the same effect on me.  I can only say that the back-ground music is appropriate and fits the story. As a side note, I was surprised and amused to see Dickie Smothers playing the federal judge who sentenced Mr. Whitacre.  If you haven't seen The Informant yet, I recommend this movie, but watch it twice for extra fun.
B003102JDM|1.0|If I could , I would give this movie no stars.   It is like watching the Book of Job, but without the happy ending.  This movie was hard to endure because it was so boring, but I did because I thought it would have a redeeming happy ending. It does not.   I cannot believe the Coen Brothers could have made this, given their previous films.  Maybe a Jewish person would like it as it had so much Jewish customs and language in it.  It was unrealistic, as far as the problems in the movie were concerned, none of which were resolved.  A total waste of time.

B0034JGBM0|5.0|Wow, what can you say?  These two never cease to BLOW MY MIND!  The level of Rock and Roll that they are putting out is incredible!  Besides crushing chords and shredding solos, the rhythm guitar makes me think of seeing ACDC back in late 70's early 80's, fantastic.  I've seen them twice (Get Behind Me tour) plus the Blackpool Lights video (which is insane!), but have never heard \\"Union Forever\\" live, this version gave me chills!  I was going to see them in Alaska on this tour but then Meg's health issues canceled it.  I'm hoping that they will do at least one more big tour (please Jack & Meg!), I have to see them again.  I hadn't heard any live for awhile, just been listening to the studio albums (get them all), and putting this on made my jaw drop all over again.  Being an old fogey (40's) I was wondering awhile back if I would ever like a new artist again, then the White Stripes showed up.  They took up the banner, and they are holding it up HIGH!  Check it out!  cheers.
B000002AQH|4.0|Few conductors take up Schumann's oratorio based on Goethe's Faust, and fewer still have recorded it. Between 1972, when Benjamin Britten gave live performances at the Aldeburgh Festival, later released by Decca, and 1994, when Claudio Abbado made this live recording with Bryn Terfel in the title role, I can't recall a single other version. The reason isn't hard to fathom. Extravagantly praised by connoisseurs, the music is at times discursive and wandering. It dates from late in Schumann's career, when his inspiration was steadily fading. Part 3 came first, in time for the Goethe centennial of 1849, with Parts 1 and 2 slowly following, culminating in the Overture, composed in 1856, just before he fully succumbed to mental illness. I find the Overture rambling and melodically neutral. It's probably best to begin with Part 3, not just because it came earliest but because, like Mahler in his Eighth Sym., Schumann was most inspired by the metaphysical second half of Goethe's epic.<br /><br />This was unusual. The doomed love story between Faust and Gretchen has always been the popular part, in no small part because Mephistopheles steals the show. Schumann devotes Parts 1 and 2 to this half, but he begins after the Faustian bargain has been struck and gives us a disjointed handful of scenes, including the Cathedral Scene and Faust's death. I won't say that any section strikes me as pure genius while others are outright lame. But Schumann the melodist isn't at his best, for those of us who love his songs, and Mahler had a more cosmic conception of the metaphysical scenes when Faust's soul is transmuted into Doctor Marianus and rises upward through the levels of heaven.<br /><br />Abbado's account is centered around Bryn Terfel as the star, and his Faust is as good as you'd expect form a singer who succeeds so well in Schumann's lieder. The supporting cast is equally starry. I wish Karita Mattila's Gretchne were more touching, and Rootering's Mephisto more menacing. They have fallen into line with Abbado's rather too civilized conducting. Orchestra and chorus are beyond reproach, and Sony's live concert recording is as good as a studio job.  but criticism is moot, since Britten's classic account is out of print and hard to find at a reasonable price. Pierre Boulez has a more energetic account on Opera d\\"Oro, but it's a BBC broadcast form 1973 if rather dull mono. So Abbado has the field to himself, unless you want to explore a period account under Philippe Herreweghe, which doesn't boast singers anywhere of tis caliber, or a recent Harnoncourt set with the Royal Concertgebouw; it also struck me as under-dramatized. So enjoy Terfel's charismatic turn and let tis somewhat elusive score settle in.to line with Abbado's rather too civilized conducting.

B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I must agree with some reviews that state the following:  \\"I waited eagerly its release, I like the album a lot too however,   \\"The Incident\\" isn't one of the best PT albums\\".    It is true, \\"The Incident\\" is a very good PT album, but isn't their best,  as I personally treasure and consider:  \\"Signify\\", \\"Dead Wing\\", \\"Light Bulb Sun\\" and of course \\"Fear of the Blank Planet\\" (which for me it is definitively their best,  and with it,  the band reached a very high level in all the ways of what this particular sentence means).    \\"The Incident\\" is very enjoyable album, and it is a \\"must have\\" for all PT fans.  Even though, the length of the only track (long: 77.00 minutes aprox) isn't hard to follow  , it is well constructed and has stronger and great tunes.  The songs of the second disc are also good. I think I don't dislike any of the tracks on \\"The Incident\\".     Once again the magic of PT isn't just only the skills of these guys (Wilson's guitar and voice, Gavin Harrison's drums, etc..) it is based also in their sound mixing and the level of production in which all their works is based, who I personally state it is inmaculated, and the atmospheric wall sound that has the dark ad beautiful magic that label all the bands releases.      Hope this review may help you !

0749953357|5.0|Seth Godin has the unique ability to find connections and explain the value of the connections in plain English, using real world examples and scenarios. I have heard many positive things about his past books, but this having been the first I have read, I find myself blown away.    The analysis of how corporate and manufacturing culture has defined our psychology is brilliant in it's analysis and disturbing in it's effects. By unveiling the programmed attitude of a factory worker and how this perspective is dooming our ourselves and the business world, Seth puts forward a new...or perhaps old way of thinking that can only inspire and push anyone who reads this book. There are too many good portions and chapters to offer a favorite, but I can only say that for the first time in my life, I am proud to be an artist.
B002UNMWAG|1.0|Wow.  This movie was sooo bad that I had to write a review.  I really liked the first movie but this is garbage.  The plot was hardly even there until the end and even then it didn't make much sense and the boondock boys hardly had any lines at all.  They seemed to be there for a token quality.  The writing was absolutely horrible and the acting was atrocious.  Most of the movie should have been cut out. The acting was so bad with the lame jokes and one liners, ugh.  Reminds me of Transformers 2 all over again.  Awful awful awful.  I want my hour and half back.
B000AL730O|5.0|Paul McCartney is one of the greatest songwriters of all time & a living legend. But there are times when Paul released some duds. \\"Driving Rain\\" & \\"Memory Almost Full\\" anyone? But in 2005 when Paul wanted to sleep walk on another album, producer Nigel Godrich made sure that wouldn't happened on his watch. Rumors has it that McCartney & Godrich got into some heated arguments while recording this album. But Godrich never back down and knew McCartney can do better. I'm glad he pushed Paul to do his best. This album is incredible. \\"How Kind Of You\\"(the best track on the album) is a mind blowing. It's show Paul's vulnerability. \\"Friends To Go\\" is a fitting tribute to George Harrison. \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" may have been a shot at his soon to be ex Heather Mills, the lyrics doesn't pull any punches. And don't be surprise to hear \\"This Never Happened Before\\" at future weddings. It's a touching song. It should had been a bigger hit. \\"Too Much Rain\\" has positive lyrics that can lift anyone out of their emo feelings. \\"A Fine Line\\", \\"At The Mercy\\" & \\"A Certain Softness\\" are also great tracks.  \\"Chaos\\" should had won the Grammy's Album Of The Year back in 2006 instead U2's \\"How To Dismantle A Bomb\\". This album was released five years ago & I'm still listening to it today. I hope McCartney & Godrich will get back together to make one more album. If not, we will appreciated what these men did together for their only collaboration. Please pick up your copy.
0307269760|2.0|The writing style is adequate, though not overly artful.  If you enjoy stories about topics such as a man killing his own children to spite his wife, this book may appeal. I found the book to be neither insightful nor uplifting - quite the opposite!
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Seeing the Sherlock Holmes movie only scratches the surface of Holmes' deductive and rational mind. With the soundtrack, though, with the intentional dischords and syncopatied accompaniment to the themes, it's as if one is enveloped into the way Holmes thinks, the long, winding thought process that eventually solves the case...just in time for another to drop on his doorstep. Excellent for any music lover, should have won the Oscar for Best Original Score.
B002MEW7YY|5.0|I almost didn't purchase this based on some of the negative, nit-picking reviews I've seen here at Amazon.  I own many other Lucias including Anna Moffo, Sutherland, Bonfadelli, Devia, Rancatore and Ciofi.  Some of these are very good.  But Netrebko's performance is something else again.  She is indeed a Lucia for the ages.  She has youth, vivacity, presence, sparkle, charisma, visually and aurally that delights the senses. This is full blown MET spectacular.  Scenery, costumes, direction, sound, everything comes together in a gorgeous, iconic production.  Don't let the nit-pickers dissuade you from owning and delighting in this gem!
B000063UR2|3.0|Great to be able to watch both versions of this movie. However, the picture quality isn't up to 21st century standards. Poor definition.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|This movie is absolutely fascinating. Not only does it follow the case of the Zodiac killer, but it also explores the idea of obsession. One thing to know before viewing, is that while it tries not to, this movie is slightly biased. The movie isn't based off of the actual Zodiac case files, rather it is based off of Robert Graysmith's book. (Some people argue the amount of accuracy). Overall I'd say this is a great movie, and it portrays well what happens when obsession controls your life.
B001QXE0OC|3.0|This album is full of fun, catchy, bubble gum, autotuned, pop songs.  Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. It's just not exactly my cup of tea.

B002ZG98J6|4.0|I'm going to start this review by saying, yes, I did read the book.    I went into this movie with one of my guy friends, and I wasn't expecting much. I read the book when I was twelve, and I vaguely remember enjoying it. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was pretty entertaining, not too cheesy or predictable, and I loved the mythology that was tied in with it. After seeing the movie I went back and read the book again. There were a lot of differences from the book. The movie appears to have been made to target teens, and I'd recommend it for teens. It was a fun movie.    I also recommend reading the book (either before or after seeing the movie). Even re-reading the book (at 17), I enjoyed it. It was quick and light and funny at times. Overall and easy/fun read.

While some/most of those kids are alright, Demi is different. Demi can sing.     Demi's second album is just amazing. Her vocals are excellent, and her songwriting has gotten even better. I totally recommend this album. Her rock/pop songs are catchy, fun, and even a little deep.     Download These:  -Catch Me-A sweet, cute, adorable, acoustic song.     -Stop the World-Fast/catchy song written with Nick Jonas.    -Remember December-Overall just a powerful song.
B00005JMXX|3.0|This movie is a fun movie to watch. That's all it is. If you're looking for a movie with awesome special effects, than it's worth the watch. I could watch this movie all the time just to see Hollywood be hit by a series of tornadoes.     This movie fails in nearly all other areas. A good portion is scientifically inaccurate, the characters/plot lack substance, dialogue is predictable, etc.     Approach this movie with that in mind, and just sit back and enjoy the special effects.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Let me start by saying that this movie is not for everyone. It's one of those movies that should be approached with an open mind, and you'll most likely either love or hate it. With that being said...    I love this movie. I'm a huge fan of the original play, and I love the 1968 film adaptation of it as well. This version is different. It's interesting, modern, fun and colorful. Plus the music is fantastic. It's the revamp that the play deserves.

But at least he confessed to it at the beginning. I can imagine the disappointment readers must have experienced before this was revealed though. Even if I hadn't known it was part fiction, I would have guessed it. The author makes himself out to be some sort of super bad ass in the book, which I highly doubt could have been the case (especially after viewing his his picture and reading his own description of himself)     It's the kind of book that I let me friends know I was reading and recommended that they read too. I'm not going to lie, it was graphic and I had the worst nightmare I've had in a few years while reading this book. I stopped reading it before I went to bed. Some parts I had to skim because they were painting TOO good of a picture for me. I'm not usually the squeamish type, but geez--that was disgusting.     I know some people really hated the author and the book when the truth came out, but I still enjoyed the book.

There's strong vocals, guitars, violin, sythesizers and some of the more thoughtful and spiritual lyrics to be found in this genre.  Kerry Livgren writes 8 songs and co writes the other 3, the result is a release which brings rewards the more times it's played.  Outstanding songs, the powerful Carry On Wayward Son, Miracles Out Of Nowhere and the moving Cheyenne Anthem.  There are 2 excellent live songs, Carry On ... and Cheyenne ....  It all comes remastered, I recommend it unreserveably.
1843793792|5.0|Did you know that Georgette Heyer is British author and literary critic Margaret Drabble's favorite historical novelist? I know! High praise from an author who has written eighteen novels, introductions to all of Jane Austen's major and minor works, been awarded a Doctorate in Letters from Cambridge University and the CBE and DBE by the Queen of England. Drabble is a living national treasure, as Heyer should have been if her novels had been taken more seriously during her life-time. However, she has always been highly esteemed by her faithful readers for close to ninety years and out of her thirty-eight Regency romance novels VENETIA is one of the most beloved.<br /><br />Set in the countryside of the North Riding of Yorkshire three years after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Venetia Lanyon is not your conventional Heyer heroine. Unmarried at age twenty-five she has never been in love, is close to being on the shelf and has resigned herself to the narrow fate of spinsterhood. Raised by her reclusive father since her mother's death fifteen years prior, Venetia has seen little of life beyond the family estate of Undershaw Manor or an occasional country dance at Harrogate. Since her father's death shortly after the Battle of Waterloo she has been overseeing the household of her younger brothers: twenty-two year-old Sir Conway, a soldier overseas with the Army of Occupation in Cambray, France and sixteen-year old Aubrey, a brilliant scholar studying for Cambridge who abhors his physical limitations from a pronounced and ugly limp. Also within her small sphere are two improbable suitors who would like to win her hand: Edward Yardley, a dull, pompous egoist who thinks NO is a YES, and Oswald Denny, a bumbling teenage wanna-be rake who idolizes Lord Byron. Life as a maiden aunt in her brother's household seems a far preferable fate until a chance encounter with an estranged neighbor, the \\"Wicked Baron\\" of Elliston Priory, leaves a surprisingly favorable impression.<br /><br />Others tell her the Baron, Lord Jasper Damerel is scoundrel, a rake and a libertine and not a suitable association for any young lady who does not want her reputation ruined. Their first encounter while she walks alone near his estate is one of Heyer's most famous scenes. (I will not reveal spoilers - but it is very praise worthy.) Damerel is as brazen and unprincipled as his reputation proceeded him, but instead of swooning or running from his advances Venetia firmly holds her ground and pelts him with literary retorts challenging his intelligence and temporarily belaying his dishonorable intensions. Their verbal sparring snaps and sparkles like dry kindling to a hungry fire confirming Heyer's brilliance with characterization and dialogue. Venetia does not hesitate to say what she thinks and that makes him laugh, a refreshing change for this world-weary social outcast. Tall, dark and disreputable, everything about rakish Damerel tells her to check herself but Venetia does the exact opposite, she befriends him. He is intrigued and continues to seduce her until the green girl before him earns his true respect and deep affection. He is in love and wants her for his wife. Venetia secretly feels the same and awaits his proposal until Damerel suddenly becomes chivalrous and will not sully her reputation by marrying her. Meanwhile her brother Conway's young bride arrives unannounced from France with her surly mother to take possession of Undershaw displacing Venetia who quickly accepts an invitation to stay with her aunt and uncle Hendred in London. Her family hopes that the change of scenery will help her forget the unsuitable Lord Damerel, but she only fears she may never see him again. However, Venetia is a realist who knows how the world works and a newly discovered family secret spurs her into action. She will need all her wit and guile to challenge propriety and to prove to Damerel that their social standing has nothing to do with keeping them apart.<br /><br />Venetia Lanyon is one of Heyer's most liberated heroines and Lord Damerel one of her darkest rogues. They seem a most unlikely pair, but Heyer's skill at devising impossible obstacles for her hero and heroine is like syllabub and sunshine, we just can't get enough if it. Upon their first meeting Damerel quotes Shakespeare, \\"How full of briars is this workaday world!\\" which is an important theme throughout the novel. Both Venetia and Damerel face the challenges of social stricture - the briars of the workaday world - and overcome them in their own way. The plot is simple and secondary to the romantic tension, scintillating dialogue and playful sparing which is so much sexier than any modern bodice ripper could hope to generate. Cleverly, Heyer's Venetia does not reform a rake, she discovers that a knight errant is what she needs.<br /><br />This new Naxos AudioBook abridged recording of Heyer's classic Regency romance read by renown British stage and screen actor Richard Armitage is a perfect pairing of witty humor and smoldering syntax. His reputation for bad boy roles such as Sir Guy of Gisborne in Robin Hood and John Thornton in North and South transition smoothly into his characterizations in Venetia. Classical trained, his velvety voice resonates all the dash and splash that a great rake like Lord Damerel should display in the most seductive and sultry tones. His characterization of upbeat Venetia Lanyon accentuates her intelligence, casual frankness and sarcastic humor beautifully. After listening to this recording of Venetia his legion of fans will be clamoring for another libertine with a \\"well-informed mind and a great deal of kindness.\\" A tall order to fill, unless you're on to the next Georgette Heyer Regency romance.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenproseof Heyer's most liberated heroines and Lord Damerel one of her darkest rogues.

Pressed into service from the French colonies of North Africa, these soldiers fought both the Germans and the injustices of being treated as second-class citizens. The Saving Private Ryan reference is made because the final battle scene reminds the viewer of the final battle scene in the aforementioned movie.  I rented this movie after hearing about it and then decided to buy it when it became available for sale.

The movie, \\"FOOD, Inc.\\" makes you sit up straight in your chair and wonder about what we put into our stomach.  Nutrition becomes important to us as an alternative to drug therapy.  This movie makes a person question the way food products are created and if the FDA is still open for business.  Supposing the movie is reasonably factual, one may ask questions about US food production.  Is anyone even concerned about the safety of the food we eat?  Why is the fox guarding the hen house in national regulatory agencies?  How fast am I able to start growing food in the back yard?   It is time that anyone concerned about the quality of what we eat votes by choosing quality over quantity in the grocery store, as well as attempting to make decent food affordable for families.  We need to wake up to the alarming methods of food production in our nation.

B0039OGGVQ|4.0|I purchased this way before the release date in anticipation of Alice Cooper's contribution.  Once received I immediately went to check the list of performers.  I was very disapppointed that I did not see Alice Cooper's name nor Iggy Pop.  I listened to the whole album and was certainly impressed with the diversity.  Its a good mix of music (in fact Ozzy sounds amazing!), but it left me wondering what happened with the Coop?  After reviewing the other written reviews, I realized my version does not contain all of the tracks.  For this I am very very disappointed and am now going to have to find one of the other cds that was made with Alice and Iggy. In addition, there is a bonus track of Fergie called Paradise City, which also was missing on my version.  A good cd, but disappointing nonetheless to know that there are so many versions around.  Just put out 1 cd and keep all of the names on it as it was advertised.  Then we wouldn't have to buy multiple versions of the same cd.  So I say its a great album, but would have been greater if my cd contained all of the hype that I spent months reading about.

This movie takes technology to a new level and, for that alone, it's worth at least watching.  Story line, to me, wasn't all it was hyped to be.  But how can you live up to a movie that broke all records and received so much attention?  If you're into sci-fi and special effects, you'll enjoy it.  If not, I suggest renting first.     As has been noted several times, this is a bare bones release.  Part of the appeal of a DVD of this movie, in my opinion, is finding out how everything was made.  For that, I am very excited about the behind the scenes and bonus footage which is expected to be released on another edition.
1601251505|5.0|The five stars isn't simply because I'm a longtime D&D dork.<br />The folks at Paizo did an amazing job with the resources in this book.<br />But what would you expect from the makers Dragon Magazine? (before their contract got yoinked)<br /><br />First let me say that this book is essentially the \\"Player's Handbook\\" and \\"Dungeon Master's Guide\\" rolled in to one 500+ page monster. The price might seem up there, but it's worth it, and it is technically 2 books in one.<br /><br />Three fairly immediate changes are Hit Die, the weird combat stuff (Bull-Rush, Trip, Grapple, Disarm, etc), and feats.<br />Many classes had their Hit Die stepped up one to make you less hesitant to try one. No more d4 for Hit Points - Wizards rejoice!<br />They also introduced CMD - or \\"Combat Maneuver Defense\\" - Which works like AC against stuff like Disarm that you aren't actively resisting.<br />Feats... You get more. Every odd level, you gain a feat. This totals 3 more by level 20, and lets a fighter gain a feat literally every single level.<br /><br />Each of the 11 base classes (1 to 20) have been slightly re-developed. As a GM that's been with 3rd edition from start to finish, I must say I'm not only cool with these changes, but I applaud and welcome them! It used to be that most of the base-20s felt like a deathtrap - something you needed to Prestige out of ASAP - but now you'd be almost foolish to add on a Prestige Class at all. Multi-classing is similar. You can do it but you'd lose so much in the long run, as every base-20 now has some sweet bonuses at the latter levels and many have an amazing 20th level ability. There's finally a good reason to take a Fighter from 1 to 20. :)<br /><br />Let me also note that the flexibility they've imbued each class with is amazing!<br />You could have two Barbarians or Fighters or Rangers or Sorcerers - and they could still be totally different!<br />Barbarians can customize their Rage, Fighters can specialize in dozens of ways, Rangers have several enemy/form/terrain options, and Sorcerers have bloodlines.<br /><br />I'm not writing off Prestige Classes either - They were not immune to the magic wand of Paizo. All of the Prestige Classes in the Dungeon Master's Guide (well most of them) were carried forward into this book, and all of them got some sweet changes too. This may seem to contradict what I was saying earlier about there not being much reason to take one, but instead now the only reason is exactly what it should have been all along... Story! Prestige Classes are nice but not needed, so chances are if someone does take levels in one, it's a fairly major story element. Something to be played towards, that makes the character a sort of icon (frankly this is what I've always wanted Prestige Classes to do). Sure a caster Prestige might seem cool, but it'll cost you your 9th level spells pre-epic. Sure the Duelist Prestige might be awesome (and it really is now), but that will cost a fighter disarm immunity and automatic critical confirmation in the end (not to mention less feats).<br /><br />Let me toss out a bit of the Prestige Class revamped flavor for you: Arcane Archers have had their abilities slightly changed, and their \\"auto imbue arrow with magic\\" capped at a +1 bonus, but progression in the class now improves casting as well! Assassin no longer gains spells to use, but their key class ability (the Death Attack) has become even more terrifying. Dragon Disciples don't gain the full Half Dragon template or all the stat increases or bonus castable spells per day, but instead allows you to keep improving your sorcerer spell growth and amplify your Draconic Heritage (as a huge fan of Sorcs and Dragons I do love this change). Eldritch Knight hit die improved, and now stacks with Fighter levels to determine whether or not you can take a feat. Mystic Theurge can now prepare spells up to half their class level using slots from the other class (letting you use Wizard slots for Cleric spells and the other way around). They even added a new Prestige class of their own - the \\"Pathfinder Chronicler\\" - which is a pretty fun Bard / Loremaster compromise (Loremaster still exists) that most classes can get in to if they really want. A \\"Pathfinder Chronicler\\" may be self gratification to Paizo... But they've earned it. :)<br /><br />Sticking to a Class is a great idea now. Prestige Classes can be major story elements once again.<br />Special combat maneuvers have been simplified with CMD, and many feats have been fixed to make more sense.<br />Take the update of the \\"Cleave\\" feat for example...<br />Standard Action, single attack at full value. If you hit and deal damage to the first, you hit hard enough to tear through, and can roll vs the second. (no more needing to \\"drop\\" a target which seriously limited this feat before - and it makes a lot more sense too)<br /><br />I could ramble on literally all day about the changes and what I love about them. No lie.<br />There are a few changes that made me raise an eyebrow, but not so bad that I can remember them.<br />The system (effectively 3.75) fits like a glove with existing 3.5 resources, with almost no mod.<br /><br />Paizo Publishing totally hit a home run with this book.<br />For fans of 3rd Edition (like myself) this is certainly an A+ Resource.<br />It looks like they're serious about keeping this series going too. Love it!<br />If I want to play 4th edition, I can break out the minis or log in to World of Warcraft.<br />(I should note that I have the 3 book 4th edition collector set too... Heh)<br /><br />If I'm going to run a game, I'll be pulling out my 3rd edition books with this one on top.<br /><br />If you loved 3rd edition and want to keep it going, get this book.

B00006I53S|4.0|This lens has a large focal range, combined with a 1.5' minimum focusing distance.    AF is quiet and relatively fast.  I've noticed a tendency for my lens to front-focus slightly at the telephoto end where I use it most.    Image quality is good, with moderate distortion at either end of it's zoom range.  I've seen some CA at high contrast edges, but this is generally hard to see unless you're looking for it.    What really makes this lens useful to me is the low MFD.  I've been able to generate impressive bokeh by moving the camera close to the subject.  This has worked well for portraits of my son for example.

B000RF7XYO|5.0|Clear, clean, precise examination of a woman from childhood to full adulthood.  The story is deep and serious, the characters amazingly well developed, the film about which you can come away having developed some knowledge of English history, Biographical insight, court intrigues, political infighting, and endless machinations that both impress and shock us at the same time.      The England of Elizabeth's time was a cruel, dirty, squalid place.  With amazing degrees of class distinction this movie gives us a valid look at the inner workings of royal rights of succession.  The terrors and fears of those in the wake of some great personage clearly shown as they have not been show any recent period film.      From the heights to the depths of English society we see vast separation between the haves and the have nothings!   From those in power and those with none.  Glory in dress, in courtly manners, in degrees of civility between those haves and have-nots, on display for anyone to witness and judge for themselves.  Then we see the squalor, cruelty and an honest look at the people who made up the mass of society under Elizabeth's reign.      We find ourselves sitting as judges on a great queen and her life and times.  Yes she is an incredible Exclamation Mark in history as was Eleanor of Aquitaine, and another rare women Boudica - Queen of the Iceni who stood against the Roman Legions and almost won her nations freedom.  The directors and producers did a good thing they chose authenticity and honesty when this film planned, written and made.      See this film if you have any desire to view greatness acted out on a stage that is vast and intimate all at once.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Like many of my peers who grew up in the eighties, Clash of the Titans holds a special place in my heart.  Harryhausen's vision burned certain iconic moments in my memory:  My Clash of the Titan's lunchbox.  My winged Pegasus toy with Harry Hamlin-looking Perseus (complete with vacuous gaze and stiff arms).  Shouting \\"Perseus!\\" and throwing any stick-like object (hockey sticks, bats, edged weapons) to my friends. All these elements have ensured a certain reverence for Clash of the Titans, not to mention hopelessly muddling my knowledge of Greek history until well into my high school years.<br /><br />This new version of Clash of the Titans is not that movie (spoilers ahead!):<br /><br />Oh, it's a reimagining of course.  There are attempts to provide the shadow of a coherent plot to the whole thing.  The original was actually a love story; the jealous goddess Thetis became Perseus' nemesis over his love for poor Andromeda, with Zeus surreptitiously helping his errant son.  In the remake Zeus is openly hostile to humanity, who is apparently attempting to overthrow the gods by...blowing up their statues, I guess. Hades manipulates Zeus into terrorizing humanity instead of asking for their prayers.  Two drachmas to the person who guesses the trick Hades has up his sleeve.<br /><br />The movie hits all the high points: Calibos (Acrisius in the new version), Pegasus, Medusa, the scorpions, the Kraken.  And for the first half at least, the plot shambles along pleasantly and the audience can marvel at the breathtaking score and dizzying 3D.<br /><br />Then the Djinn show up.  I have a phrase I called \\"jump the monkey\\" which is a bit like \\"jump the shark.\\" The last installment of Indiana Jones had me interested until vine-swinging monkeys jumped to the rescue of our hero.  The moment turned pulp heroic fun into retrograde cartoon pandering to audiences of all ages.  The Djinn are Clash of the Titans' \\"monkey jump.\\"<br /><br />Because this new incarnation of the movie has to be Bigger and Better than anything we've seen before, the scorpions that arise from Acrisius' blood (not Medusa's like in the original) are gargantuan. So big, in fact, that it stretches our willing suspension of disbelief that our heroes will even be able to defeat them.  And then they do.  Whew! A jump cut later and...<br /><br />BIGGER scorpions show up.  These are colossal.  Our heroes can't possibly defeat them.  Fortunately, we have a deus ex machine in the form of Djinn.  They are \\"sand demons,\\" some kind of Greek-style cyborgs who replace their broken bodies with magic.  They have cool blue glowing eyes and know how to control giant scorpions.  Actually, they RIDE them.<br /><br />Scorpions.  Giant scorpions.  That didn't exist until Acrisius bled.  The Djinn carry around entire howdahs just to ride these giant scorpions in the span of just one day.  I made up a reason for why this is. Surely the scorpions were created from the sand, not Acrisius' blood, and that's why the Djinn are so familiar with them.  Yeah, okay, I'll roll with it...<br /><br />But wait...why are the Djinn still hanging around?  Why is one of the Djinn joining Perseus' party?  Why, when Perseus is trying to rouse his troops as they descend into Medusa's lair, is the Greek equivalent of a Wookie going along with them? Why has this movie jumped the monkey?<br /><br />I was so dazzled by the special effects that it didn't even dawn on me until my wife pointed it out. Medusa's gaze doesn't work on the Djinn, but it works on a Kraken? Did anyone else notice this Kraken-sized flaw in the plot?  Or did the directors just figure the 3D would make up for it?<br /><br />It didn't.  As much as I tried to love this new version of Clash of the Titans, I can't.  I can merely appreciate it for the big, dumb, Kraken of a movie it is.'ve seen before, the scorpions that arise from Acrisius' blood (not Medusa's like in the original) are gargantuan.

B001F6TXME|5.0|This remote does everything I need it to.  I have been using this remote to lock the shutter of my Nikon D5000 while I take star trail pictures and it works great.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a Nikon release cord.
B00006I53S|3.0|I have had this lens now for three years.  It is my second lens.  My first (serious) lens was the Canon 100mm f/2.8 Macro.  This lens was intended to be everything the macro prime wasn't.  For a while, it was.    It's a good lens, no doubt.  Useful, versatile, fast and pretty sharp for the price.  Not super sharp, though.  Beware of amateurs claiming sharpness when they haven't seen anything better.  The 100 mm Macro kills this lens for sharpness.    That said, I've sold framed prints at 11 x 17\\" and 12 x 18\\" from this lens, no sweat.  But there are a couple of areas where this lens shows it's weaknesses.    I shot a wedding with it - my first.  I chose it for the versatility in a high speed situation and it was the right choice amongst the two lenses I have.  But it struggled to keep up (and outright failed) without the flash, even when I was shooting at ISO 6400 at the mainly candle-lit reception.  Even with IS on.  With flash (580 EX and a diffuser) it performed very well.  I managed to get a couple shots of the newlywed couple entering the reception hall without the flash hand held at 1/2 second.  Yes, they were motion blurred - but that was them moving.  And the contrast between the relatively sharp areas around them, and their movement, worked well.  The IS works.    But upon processing the images from the wedding, I noticed that in several shots, there was such bad CA that I was literally forced to go in and clone it out.  Lighting was a cross between natural light through the windows, candle light, and incandescent.  The CA was visible even in 4x6 prints of those images!  And those were the \\"I do\\" shots.  The most critical of all. That really put a bad taste in my mouth concerning this lens.    So, in the end, yes, I use this lens.  It's a good one.  Not my favorite, but it is too versatile to pass up until I can replace it with a 24-70 f/2.8L and a 70-200 F/2.8L II.    Probably more than adequate for amatuers.  If you're going to use it for weddings, it's adecent lens to get started with, but you'll probably want to replace it with the above two lenses asap.
0312370849|5.0|It has been too long a time since I have read a book that touched me this deeply. It truly speaks to the heart. I could barely put it down, and finished it in several days, but it stayed with me between readings and long after I completed it.   The chapters switched between 2 time periods, but the transitions were flawless. It was easy to identify with both stories and more than that, to fully \\"feel\\" what these people were experiencing.   This book was written to connect you to it's characters in a timeless way, and it totally succeeded.   Reading it is like adding a life experience to your own life.
0765350386|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is an unmistakably talented writer. I picked up Mistborn from a Barnes & Noble stand where it was being heralded as the next Twilight-esque \\"big thing.\\" What I found, though, was far better than I could have expected.   Sanderson created a believable world that somehow escaped cultures and timelines (and jargon) of our own world, but still maintained believability. The characters were oddly relatable, even in circumstances that we would (probably) never find ourselves in - slavery, thievery, political rebellion, nobility... the circumstances spanned the charts of possibility for human experience, but every character acted in their own way to each predicament, in realistic and often amusing ways. It features a type of magic that I don't think has been thought of before and was refreshing in that it followed strict natural laws and seemed so plausible! I wonder if others will start to plagiarize this type of magic, because really the whole thing was genius.  The story follows an intricate political plot intertwined with the relationships and inner struggles of numerous characters.  Sanderson gets into the minds of several different characters with ease and really makes you care about them and their stories. He also has a gift for dialogue and dark humor, and a lot of light humor as well. While I'll admit the first few chapters started out just a little slow, by the last half I could hardly put it down. I finished this book in a few sittings, which is entirely uncharacteristic of me and I think speaks to the way Sanderson wrote this book. The plot moves along, and is both satisfying and frustrating as little victories in the characters' plans are met with agonizing defeats. I couldn't stop turning pages, wondering how in the world things were going to work out, and I was never met with a single cop-out. Even though there are more books to the series, Mistborn in itself ends in a highly satisfying way and left me feeling like I wanted nothing more thanto go join a book club so I could talk about it. In a word, it was just cool! Read this book!!

There are a couple nice things on here, but a lot of it is different versions of well-known Hendrix songs or some really unfinished stuff.  As the booklet in the CD describes this was stuff put together after Electric Ladyland.  I enjoyed \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" and a couple of the other songs at the front of the disk.

B000G7PNAE|4.0|This album takes me back in a way almost no other album can.  Journey was THE band to love and follow amongst the junior high girls I went to school with:)      Best songs on the album:  Escape  Stone in Love  Don't Stop Believin'    Not a big fan of their slower hits.  But they have a very unique brand of anthemic rock that, to my ears, has stood the test of time.  If Journey is a band that interests you, this album should be the second one you ever purchase.  The first being Infinity, released in the late 1970s.

0307463745|4.0|This book is full of some great advice for those who are planning to start their own business, or currently have their own business. It's a new business book with a fresh, down-to-earth approach. The core concepts of the book are about creating something people want and doing it as simply and quickly as you can. Because you are better off shipping half a product rather than a whole project that's been half assed. Jason Fried talks about some of the core strategies they use and live by at 37signals. As always with these sort of books it's a lot of great ideas that seem good on paper, but it's always about finding how you can make some of that work in your own life. Topics including, meetings being a waste of time and interruptions ruining the work day are things everyone loves to fight against. My biggest problem I had with the book is that it is really just a rehash of a lot of previous blog post and talks, which is the same issues I think many people had with Gary Vaynerchuk's, Crush It. If you're familiar with Jason Fried's work already the book is just a rehash of the same stuff. As a fan of 37signals, I'm a frequent reader of their blog and listen to the podcast whenever I can. So most of the ideas in the book I've already read and thought about and I hope are core concepts I possess. I've also seen Jason Fried speak recently and pretty much everything he talked about when I saw him was what was in the book. Which makes sense since it's his thoughts, concepts and ideas, in the book and on the blog. But my hope was that they would expand on the ideas frequently discussed in their blog and elaborate on some more of their personal experiences in running a very successful small company. Still it's a nice re-cap in an easily digestible package.
B000JLSM00|2.0|I read all these great reviews and so I took a chance on buying this BR DVD. And while the acting was ok, even perhaps accurate in terms of attitudes of the day (1860s), the story line of this film was a huge turn-off for me. Perhaps I am naive, but it seemed to me the characters were stereotypical. The treatment and attitudes shown even the peaceful native americans of the era were deplorable. The callous way Jeffrey Hunter's character kicked the native woman and then laughed at her as if she had no feelings as a human being... worse than you would treat a dog... this behavior was disgusting actually. Natalie Wood wore makeup of the 1950s and didn't come close to portraying her character accurately. In fact, all of the characters were portrayed as if they were un-intelligent. I did not enjoy this film at all and I am writing this review in hopes that future potential customers will not be mislead by all the great 5 star reviews like I was. Sorry, get Rio Bravo or even Donovan's Reef if you like John Wayne. They are tremendously superior to this film.
B0000024IE|5.0|After listening to this album multiple times in a row I have come to the conclusion that the knowledge inside of it is as deep if not deeper than a graduate level course at a University.  With the ever present force and charisma of Chuck D the lyrics create dissonance for those who felt they had a grasp on what the black community was thinking.  Tracks like \\"polly wanna cracker\\", and \\"Welcome to the Terrordome\\" convey clear messages that something is wrong and the steady delivery of Chuck D combined with the beats by Terminator X provide the emotional force needed for listeners to take the message with them long after the song is over.  Buy this album and listen to it with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I got sucked into this movie when it was recently broadcast on TV - I had read some terrible reviews when it came out, didn't like the previews, and wasn't interested in seeing it at all.   I think the music initially captured my attention the other night on TV but I was drawn into this movie and loved it.  A weepy that's for sure, and while very funny at times, I would not say it's a romantic comedy.  Reflecting on the movie I can see that the supporting characters are not very three dimensional, and of course it's all rather unbelievable if you think about it too much, but the acting was great, music great, I bought it all the whole time I was watching.  It does make you think about your relationships with friends and spouse, and think about how you treat people in life as if they are always going to be there until suddenly they are not.  For a supposedly light weight film, that's pretty good.  I didn't find it creepy or icky as some people have - I thought it was thought provoking in questioning what  is the \\"best\\" or \\"right\\" way to deal with the death of a loved one.    And I'm buying the film because I'd like to watch it again, experience the characters again, and hear the great music and see great shots of Ireland.

B002T9H2MO|4.0|From The New Leaf, my blog on books and the occasional movie: [...]    Good science fiction is hard to find.    Here's the problem: science fiction is unlike other fiction in that it is not only telling a story, it is proposing concepts. For example, humans colonize Mars; what would that look like? Humans create artificial intelligence; what are the ramifications?    Back to the problem: because science fiction can so easily be just about the fantastical proposition -- faster-than-light travel, nanotechnology, etc. -- the story itself and the characters in it are in danger of being a means to an end. In the worst case, the characters are just props arranged in the landscape of the big concept. They don't really have deep emotional lives, their dialogue isn't that thoughtful, their actions predictable. They just serve the big idea. (In fiction this is often called \\"hard sci-fi.\\") Maybe that's why I always preferred Star Wars to 2001: A Space Odyssey -- George Lucas' concepts served the story, not the other way around.    So for those of us who like to dream -- about space, lasers, robots and other unabashedly teenage-boy topics -- but also like great stories, science fiction can be a pretty unsatisfying addiction. You always think the next hit will be the big one that transports you -- \\"this story will have great characters, I just know it!\\" -- and when it doesn't, when their dialogue is pulled straight from a soap opera and the language is limp, it makes your come-down all the more crushing. And like any junkie, once you've recovered a little, you reach for the next hit.    Nevertheless, my quest goes on. I've always loved science fiction for the way it transports you to another world entirely ... but still a plausible one, one that COULD happen if certain dominoes fall. So if I hear of a sci-fi movie that might be halfway decent, I give it in a try, in the hopes of finding the dilithium crystal in the haystack that has good plot, good script and god help us, good characters.    Moon falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum I described above. On one hand, the characters serve a larger concept -- a devilishly clever one set in the not-too-distant future. On the other hand, it is by its nature about the lone human being in the movie -- and what becomes of him while living alone on the most inhuman landscape imaginable, the far side of the moon.    Moon is thinking man's sci-fi. Its long silences, antiseptic colors and themes of alienation and solitude would have Kubrick raising a glass. Its initial question is, what will we use for energy in the future, when fossil fuels are running out? The premise of Moon is that a new energy industry has arisen mining \\"hydrogen 3 from the gravel of the moon. Turns out a treasure trove of energy was just waiting to be ground into powder on the moon. All Lunar Industries needs are poor saps willing to sign a three-year contract to man a mining station -- alone. For three years. On the moon. With only a semi-sentient, slow-speaking robot named Gerty as your companion. (Kubrick lowers his glass and considers a lawsuit.)    And it turns out the poor sap we're spending the movie with, Sam Bell, has a wife and kid back home that he hasn't seen in two years and 50 weeks. As the movie begins, he has two weeks to go.    In this movie, Sartre was wrong: hell is not other people, hell is yourself and no one else. Moon would have been engaging if it was only about the psychological and emotional things that can happen to a person under such isolation.  But the movie takes the theme of alienation from oneself one jarring step further, and bizarre and fascinating things ensue. I wish I could write about them but  you'd kill me for the spoilers. This particular weirdness is a sci-fi theme that's been handled many times, but is expertly done here; Duncan Jones deftly explores what really happens to a human being under these extreme and totally  novel circumstances. His answer is surprising. It disturbs,it breaks your heart, it rivets you to the seat wondering what will happen next.    Sam Rockwell, whose work I didn't really know before, does a terrific job being understated, agitated, psychotic, soberly sane. As the sole human character in the movie (save Sam's wife Tess and daughter Eve, whom we see only on video), this role must have demanded incredible energy and discipline. He achieves a range of emotions and actions that are a crazy joy to follow.    Moon's themes are driven home by the photography. The desolation of the movie, the white empty space station spaces, the wide-angle shots of the cratered surface, are haunting. It just makes you want to run to a forest as fast as possible.    Where I wish the movie had been stronger is a somewhat simplistic man vs. the corporation theme. Lunar Industries could have been a little more sophisticated; their actions kind of stretch believability. And I'd like to have seen Gerty used in different ways; voiced by Kevin Spacey, there was so much potential there. But overall the movie does more successful things than not.    Moon is disturbing, original and ultimately satisfying. It may not be in your lifetime top 10, but it is a crafty piece of scripting and is expertly shot and acted. It also manages to genuinely surprise us, a rare thing in modern movies. It stays with you. Above all, for being a science fiction story that delivers both high concept and moving characters, I recommend it.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|This is a very special treat from Brian Culbertson.  I only wish more artists would provide the video performances of their hit songs along with the audio.  I've enjoyed Brian 's music since I was first introduced to it and seen him a few times but the DVD performances is another dimension.  Its worth the price and very well produced.  I would recommend this project to any Brian Culbertson fan.
B001AN2BMG|4.0|Nikki Sixx, DJ Ashba and James Michael have put together a masterpiece! I love the music, the songwriting, the guitar playing of DJ Ashba, the vocal of James Michael and Nikki's voice telling his own story. I love that I put it in my car stereo and didn't stop driving until it was over, and most of all I love the fact that Nikki had the balls to make this CD in the first place.     My favorite songs on the CD? Well, if I have to choose I have to say \\"Life is Beautiful\\" and \\"Girl with the Golden Eyes\\" but that's a hard decision to make! I don't think I have skipped a track yet!     Nikki has also written a book called \\"The Heroin Diaries: A Year In the Life of a Shattered Rock Star\\" which you can pick up at any of your local bookstore this month. Look, we all have our demons in our past we have to deal with sooner or later but right now its all good for Nikki Sixx and Sixx:AM. I am so happy for this band and all the effort they have put into making this new beginning come true. I am also so happy that I was right all these years...there was always great talent hidden away under the mask of \\"Motley Crue\\".     Grab the book and read it...pick up the CD and listen to it. We don't all get second chances in life so take a lesson from Nikki Sixx...when you get one...run with it!    College Underground Radio   [...].
0316017922|4.0|Outliers By Malcolm Gladwell is a fantasic read filled with strong statistical analysis and a very solid thesis that at times may over generalize the facts of his argument.  I picked up this book on my birthday not having read either of Mr. Gladwell's first two novels,.not knowing what to expect.  I had recently finished Freakonomics and can say the Mr. Gladwell hits a homerun knocking Freakonomics out of the ballpark.  His oberservations and analysis are not based on the general approach to cause and effect but they drill down significnatly deeper discovering what it is that makes us all so truely unique and equal despite the success of some and not others.  That our chances of Success in our lives is more a function at least initially with when and where we were born rather than based solely on desire to work hard and overcome adversity.  That these specific factors aligned with our cultural background set into motion a unique set of inherent DNA that allows some of us to be in just the right position at the right time to rise to greatness ....That and little support from all of those around us.  Outliers is a GREAT book and an even better read.  I really had difficultly putting it down....Buy it and read it today....You will be very impressed.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Some more cynical would maybe say that these box sets - mono and stereo - are just more ways to milk the Beatles empire. Maybe that is even partially true. But I prefer to look at this set as something long overdue and years in the making.<br /><br />Where the three-anthology CD series in the '90s showed the raw talent and beginnings of the band, the Beatles Stereo Box Set is, IMO, a culmination of the entire career of the Fab Four. And does so with amazing thoroughness - all albums are included in their own sleeves inside a very sturdy black case - and with sharp, clear sound.<br /><br />I am admittedly not much of a techie and, therefore, cannot get into the pluses and minuses of mono versus stereo sound. I can only offer an every-person kind of review and state, without a doubt, that the sound is rich and full, every nuance can easily be heard with these re-masters. From the early days of \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" to the final days of \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", it is a treat to the ears to have the catalog out in its entirety - this set also includes tracks that did not make it on to the albums, as well as mini DVD documentaries - in such a handy fashion, with such care taken to preserve the classics.<br /><br />So if this does end up being the pinnacle of \\"new\\" Beatles releases, I cannot think of a better way to end the merchandise train. (Though, naturally, I am skeptical. I'm sure there is likely other material somewhere...)<br /><br />This fan, however, feels it is money well spent to have such a vast array of material and such quality at my fingertips!
B002XTBE6K|4.0|Was I the only one shocked by the abrupt ending of this very well-acted and well-directed version of the great Jane Austen masterpiece?  My daughters and I were thoroughly absorbed by this delightful rendition of one of our favorite stories until it was \\"over\\" without really being over.  Is there another disc forthcoming that we don't know about?  If not, where is the end of the story?  Since there is a classic book to bring to life, I don't know why it would be acceptable to spend 229 minutes creating an enchanting experience and then drop it like a hot potato.  And I do agree with another reviewer that more of Jane Austen's wit would have improved the script, though the performances themselves are wonderful.
B00005MP58|5.0|I originally finished this review on 17 September 2004 (pre blu-ray) but hesitated to post because of its length.  I wrote as I did in enthusiasm for the production itself, in wishing to respond to some especially well-written reviews mentioned below & to some recurring themes that I found curious.  Since then I have kept up with the hundreds of posts, delighting in the dialogue that never wants to quit! Now newly encouraged to post by Mr. Richter's review of 8 December 2009 I see he has written in excellent detail on several of my themes.  I offer this as a complementary piece since I also expand on some of his.  Also since 2004, I was struck by several reviewers who so well stated what I was struggling to say regarding the beauty of the leading women - that they seem chosen to embody what was considered most beautiful in the demeanor, painting, sculpture & cameo art of Austen's period, not necessarily our own time (see Pyles - 1/9/06 & Damamirlo - 11/8/08). Thanks to all of you for your contributions.  Now - maybe better late than never - here is mine.  First, I have watched only the old VHS set which despite some awkward, cut-off views, graininess & inconvenience I like very much for its warm colours.  I'll stick with it until there is something which recaptures those colours with better clarity & adds more gracious centering, richer sound.  I have not yet read any commentary by people involved in the production other than a bit by Colin Firth on playing Mr. Darcy.  I've watched this BBC/A&E Pride & Prejudice multiple times after happening upon an episode on Scottish TV & have become as obsessed as many.  Quite a few reviews here have been enjoyable & helpful.  I'm now eager to see the earlier film versions to compare. Whatever their merits I am puzzled by those who do not think the people playing the lead couples for BBC/A&E are beautiful enough or that the film follows both letter & spirit of Jane Austen.  Of course beauty is always a matter of taste but in thecase of Elizabeth it seems clear from the book that hers, as one person put it, is the sort that grows on one.  When Darcy first begins to be attracted he debates with himself about certain imperfections in her form.  Even her \\"fine eyes\\" must have a controversial element that Miss Bingley may disparage them (in book & film) with more reason than simple jealousy.  As I got to know Ms. Ehle many of the glances of those eyes & her general wealth of expression brought me to tears.  Jane is radiant in her blond gentleness, also well showing her inner strength.  Bingley only appears vapidly handsome at times because he is a happy, uncomplicated person surrounded by much more conflicted souls who necessarily interest us more.  Those who wish the writer hadn't left out Austen's scenes of Elizabeth with her mother & Darcy after her engagement have a good point.  I miss them too the more I think about it but as time was probably the issue I don't know what I would want left out.  This whole feeling of wanting is not inconsistent with Austen.  She almost always writes such lively detail into her characters & plots only to leave us suddenly hanging as she hurries through their marriages.  We are happy for our new friends & at once agonized to say good-bye.  Thank you to the women from Inverness, Scotland (3/19/01) & Holland, MI (7/2/01).  You wrote so eloquently especially about your favourite Colin Firth scenes that I was inspired to write.  Austen writes so much from Elizabeth's perspective that for the sake of film we need these (sometimes \\"extraneous\\", imagined) Darcy scenes for balance, to help us understand his attraction & development.  That they work so naturally with Austen's plot & provide some of the most memorable scenes is a tribute to the writer & director's imaginations & Firth's prodigious talents.  The \\"look\\" scene over the Pemberley fortepiano doesn't exist in Austen.  You may remember that there is a morning call among the women during which they try for polite conversation (led by Georgiana's companion & Mrs. Gardiner) & eat a lot of gorgeous fruit.  The men are out fishing & only Darcy comes in later causing more embarrassment for Elizabeth since everyone is suspicious.  Austen only describes this scene other than Miss Bingley's taunt (that doesn't mention Wickham's name).  She picks up the dialogue later with Miss Bingley's jabs at Darcy - leading to his annoyed but triumphant, ringing defense of Elizabeth's appearance.  Including the early part of this scene would have meant making up a lot of new dialogue - something I think they tried to avoid.  The solution?  It seems to be a kind of soiree with everyone present where music is the principal language followed by the expressions of those listening.  This grows organically from Darcy's delight at Elizabeth's playing at Rosings (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you could find anything wanting...\\").  He hears the inner spirit of herself & the music expressed in her performance, whatever her technical deficiencies, & naturally is longing to find a way to hear her again.  Even though WE only hear the end the choice is inspired.  (Check out a translation of Cherubino's Act II aria from Mozart's \\"Marriage of Figaro\\" if you are unfamiliar with it.)  His eyes melt in the warmth of his delight - not only in love of Elizabeth, of the music, of his sister, but in seeing them together absorbed by common interest.  Notice in the inn scene his manner of anxious eagerness that they \\"hit it off\\".  Notice how some added scenes show us how he cares for his sister, how Elizabeth's unaffected love for Jane draws him to her.  He loves Elizabeth for herself but also knows she is the best companion (with all the silly, vain women around them) to make Georgiana forget her shyness, her past injuries, & to coax her into the truly happy, accomplished woman he longs for her to be.        I am nearly as moved by the little scene going to or from the nightly dog walk.  The relief of seeing the two women together gives spring to his step.  He fairly dances into the darkened room to relive his delight while the vision is still fresh - exactly what a lover would do.  Both these scenes are more poignant because his relief is not that of fulfillment but only of new hope born of the new warmth & understanding in Elizabeth's gaze.  He is too humbled to be sure of her now when in fact she does not yet understand her own feelings.  So what of the fencing & swimming scenes?  I don't claim to know whether it would be \\"natural\\" for a man of his rank (or any) to attend a public class or to jump in a murky frog pond (clearly not the lake or river as some have written) at that time.  Maybe these imaginings ARE too modern.  Of course they show him wrestling with his emotions & the famous leap forms the culmination of a little thread of Darcy shown cooling his heated passions.  But also one might notice that he is submitting himself to the scrutiny of his peers - & possibly \\"inferiors\\" -  when he would have had every right to a private fencing master.  The original plan was to film the swimming scene in the nude (see Firth's 2001 \\"Fresh Air\\" interview on US public radio) which Firth felt would have been more natural in a place where he expected no scrutiny at all.  I'm not sure.  The man has just ridden perhaps thirty miles or more on a hot August day.  He sits down, considers a bit, pulls off the more encumbering items & impatiently jumps in, perhaps looking forward to walking back with the breeze on his wet clothes.  I think all these scenes help show us Darcy as a shy, natural, honest, free-spirited man behind all his aristocratic upbringing.  We can understand better here than from the book why Elizabeth appeals to him so much as a kindred spirit.  Thanks to the intelligence of Davies, Langton & Firth these new thoughts add richly to my love of Austen's work.  Just more persuasion for a few nay-sayers that the whole team did something very special.    Finally, a bit more about music.  I'm delighted with the period detail.  Notice the musician playing bass on the wood & leather serpent at the Netherfield ball, the best European masters sought earnestly by Mary & Georgiana, the empty brilliance of Mrs. Hurst's Mozart, the easy familiarity with country dances.  Even giddy Lydia not only cherishes her steps but the names of her favourite tunes - for all that \\"every savage can dance\\", you know.  Carl Davis' score fascinates me.  I'm sure there are allusions I'm not getting since I do hear a few.  Are there little anachronistic hints of Wagner when Darcy is shown with a particularly gloomy Byronic or even early Wagnerian air?  At his most agitated he reminds me more of Goethe's Werther.  Is it just an inside joke since Wagner was born the same year as the book appeared?  If so, it makes me smile at rather the wrong places.  But as the Darcy/Elizabeth struggle intensifies does anyone else hear echoes of Schubert's C major quintet?  All I need is this reminder of the great, throbbing, longing Adagio to bring tears.  The restless major-minor shifting is so perfect for them even though it's later than 1813 also.  Endless riches of association.
0307454541|5.0|I hadn't read this book earlier because I've been distracted with other things. It's obviously been all over the bookshelves and supermarkets for the last year or so, so someone must think it's worthwhile. Eventually I felt compelled to pick up a copy, and boy does it live up to the hype. It's as if P.D. James were crossed with some sort of Scandinavian novelist, and the result is quite entertaining and very good.<br /><br />The novel is long, and the plot is complicated. There are two plot threads that only meet about halfway through the book, with digressions at various times which, while distracting, add to our understanding of the main characters.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist is an investigative journalist who is part-owner of a magazine. When he gets convicted of libel (he was set up) he believes he should take a leave of absence from his own publication, and get out of Stockholm for awhile. Coincidentally he is approached by an elderly lawyer who represents a retired captain of industry. The old man has been obsessed for the last 30+ years with the disappearance of his brother's granddaughter, who was his favorite relative, and who, had she survived and been around, probably would have been running the family empire. Instead her brother's been running things, and he's not doing that good a job. His sister vanished when she was a teenager, more than three decades earlier, from the family compound in the North of Sweden. It's located on an island in the Gulf of Bothnia. The island is connected to the mainland by a single bridge, the bridge was blocked, and somehow she was taken off of the island, and the old man believes she was killed there or somewhere else. He asks Mikael to investigate, and he goes to work.<br /><br />Before the lawyer and the captain of industry hire Mikael, they decide to check up on him, to make sure he's an acceptable person for the investigation. They hire a security company, which employs an interesting investigator. This is the title character, a tiny introverted wisp of a girl named Lisbeth Salander. In spite of her strange, alienated personality, she's an excellent researcher and investigator, and she does a thorough job digging into Blomkvist's life and character. She also becomes convinced that his libel conviction is at least questionable, and eventually she decides to help him in his search for the fate of the missing granddaughter.<br /><br />This is a long novel, as I said, and it takes a while to get going. That being said, it's an interesting story, and the conclusion is very satisfying. The characters are interesting. I thought Blomkvist a bit stereotypical, but Salander is so unique that she more than makes up for whatever shortcomings Blomkvist has. I'm looking forward to the second book in the series, which I'll read when I get a chance.rted wisp of a girl named Lisbeth Salander.

1400063515|3.0|Many other reviewers here at Amazon and elsewhere have done an admirable summarizing the key topics addressed by Taleb in his book on the \\"Black Swan\\" -- his metaphor for events that fundamentally could not be predicted by the mechanisms that humans (including scholars) use to understand past events and frame their expectations for the future.  Therefore, I won't spend additional time rehashing these topics.  Overall, I feel that Taleb makes some compelling points about the problems of experiential induction, \\"winner take all\\" effects, and probability models centered around the Gaussian or normal distribution.  He also provides some useful examples and thought experiments from everyday life that illustrate these problems effectively.      However, I feel that the main downfall of this book lies in Taleb's frequent but unfocused references to philosophical and literary figures and concepts that seem far too obscure to appeal to the average reader.  The author's choice to constantly fling these references at his readers, as if he's desperately seeking to demonstrate his intellectual pedigree, detracts from the clarity and thematic unity of the book and can be both dull and downright confusing for readers, as in the case where Taleb invents the story of a fictional French-Russian philosophe-author as evidence of the \\"Black Swan\\" effect with nary an explanation for how such a story provides greater value than a comparable example taken from real life (or even no example at all).  This meandering, half-philosophical half-practical style, combined with Taleb's sometimes-tiring and often unprofessional sarcasm and derision for those who have yet to see and apply the (admittedly valid) wisdom of his points about randomness, left me with scarcely enough patience to get through the entire book.  I felt that he could have communicated his ideas in equal detail but with greater impact (and less self-aggrandizement) in a book half or two-thirds this length.       In short, Taleb's main ideas are interesting and worth considering, but don't expect this book to give you a pithy pitch about the influence of randomness on the world.  The book is ultimately as much or more concerned with the philosophical implications of this randomness than it is with how you can protect yourself against randomness (or alternatively, leverage it to gain some benefit or advantage).  While that might not be a negative thing for a book about philosophy, I found it distracting and disappointing for a book in a more mass-market nonfiction genre.

0312360258|4.0|DISCLAIMER: This book is from my own personal library and the synopsis contains spoilers.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />\\"Enter the dark, magical world of the House Of Night, a world very much like our own, except here vampyres have always existed. Sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird has just been Marked as a fledgling vampyre and joins the House Of Night, a shcool where she will train to become an adult vampyre. That is,if she makes it through the Change - and not all of those who are Marked do. It sucks to begin a new life, especially away from her friends, and on top of that, Zoey is no average fledgling. She has  been chosen as special by the vampyre Goddess Nyx. Zoey discovers she has amazing powers, but along with her powers come bloodlust and an unfortunate ability to Imprint her human ex-boyfriend. To add to her stress, she is not the only fledgling at the House Of Night with special powers: When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite group, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny - with a little help from her new vampyre friends.\\"<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I've owned the first four books in this series for almost a year now and have never gotten around to reading them. I did, however, read MARKED in one day. I started it this morning and just polished it off about twenty minutes ago. Although I think the \\"vampyre world\\" is much like the world Harry Potter found himself in in Rowling's first book of the series, the idea to substitute vampyres for witches/wizards was an ingenius part on the Casts. Anyone with the slightest interest in vampires/vampyres will love this series. Especially tweens and teens.<br /><br />I'm not saying I didn't like the book. I loved it, and I plan on reading the rest of what I have and continuing to follow the series, yes it's that good. I found Zoey's mentality a bit immature, but then again, I'm a thirty-three year old adult, why wouldn't I find a sixteen-year-old's mentality immature? (Yea, I can totally hear some of my readers snickering at that one ;-)<br /><br />So, if you're in the mood for a new series, I'd whole-heartedly recommend this one. No matter what age you are, you will love the Cast ladie's story and impeccable writing style. They certainly know how to rope a reader and reel them in.<br /><br />I'll give this particular book 4 of 5 bells. Yea, I'm that awesome and so are P.C. and Kristin Cast.ar-old's mentality immature?

1400052173|5.0|Wow! This book tells the true story of Henrietta Lacks and her family's attempts at understanding how her cells have impacted science.It is part medical research history, part human interest and part science lesson. Civil rights and patient's medical rights are also woven in throughout the book. I was impressed that the author was able to balance the many story lines and at the same time make it simple enough for the average reader to not only understand all the complexities of this scientific mystery, but enjoy it as well.I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00361DR4Q|5.0|I saw this recording listed and thought there must be some catch; La Traviata performed at La Scala on Blu-ray for less than $10 didn't seem possible. I'm delighted to report it's for real! This is a production of the entire opera on stage at La Scala recorded live with audience in 2007.<br /><br />As one would expect, the production is first class; the chorus and orchestra do a fabulous job and the settings are worthy of La Scala. The icing on the cake is the singers; all major rolls are well sung and generally look the part. The tenor, Ramon Vargas has less of a stage presence than the tenor on my other recording of La Traviata, Placido Domingo, but one should not hold that against lesser mortals.<br /><br />Since the performance is a live production, the audience response is recorded as well; using the DTS-HD Master Audio places the listener in the Teatro alla Scala di Milano at this 2007 production. It's pretty exciting!<br /><br />The HD video is so detailed I believe I could have counted the dots in the material on Violetta's sleeve in the first act. I have an OPPO BDP-83 connected to my Samsung T220HD TV/Monitor and when playing it on this set up one might say there is too much detail to be seen. I'm sitting much farther back with my primary surround system and will freely confess that less is more in this regard.<br /><br />If you enjoy Verdi, and La Traviata in particular, I highly recommend you get this recording. The sound track offers both LPCM stereo and the DTS-HD Master Audio and does a great job on both.<br /><br />I have viewed some of the bonus features and had mixed feelings about them; I am something of a traditionalist and have problems with productions of Siegfried that have a chest freezer sitting in the background; but that's just me I suppose. The section from Giselle looked very interesting and seemed to promise a good performance of that ballet.<br /><br />This is another one I'm delighted to have in my collection!

B00004TJKI|4.0|James Stewart was really a fantastic actor.  Winning the Oscar for \\"The Philadelphia Story,\\" Stewart served proudly in the Army Air Corps during W.W.II.  It was after returning to films that Stewart showed just how many different genres of films he could excel in.  After starring in the classic \\"Its A Wonderful Life\\" (which was not successful during its initial release) and the comedy \\"Harvey,\\" Stewart turned to the western and starred in 6 classic, hard-biten westerns directed by Anthony Mann.  Then came his his Hitchcock phase with the classics \\"Rear Window,\\" \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"The Man who Knew Too Much.\\" (He previously appeared in Hitchcock's \\"Rope\\" in 1948.)  After appearing in this film in 1959, Stewart continued making classic westerns like \\"Liberty Valance,\\" \\"How the West Was Won\\" and \\"Shenandoah.\\"  He also appeared in numerous comedies like \\"Bell, Book and Candle,\\" \\"Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation\\" and \\"Take Her, Shes Mine.\\"  The man really could do anything in films.  However, I think \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" is one of his greatest performances.  As the samll-town lawyer who defends an angry Army Lieutenant accused of shooting the man who raped his wife, Stewart is simply fantastic in this film's many dramatic courtroom scenes. The rest of the cast is terrific as well.  Ben Gazzara,( one of my favorites from his  1960's tv series \\"Run for Your Life,\\") is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off as the angry Army Lieutenant.  Lee Remick, a beautiful and wonderful actress who died much too soon, is quite sexy as the Lieutenant's slutty wife.  George C. Scott gives his usual impressive performance as the prosecuting attorney.  (I still think Scott's performance in \\"Patton\\" is the greatest performance I've ever seen in film.)  Eve Arden is  excellent as Stewart's long-suffering secretary and Arthur O. Connell, an actor I never cared for very much as a result of so many of his guest appearances on mediocre tv shows, is actually quite good as Stewart's alcoholic former-lawyer friend.  Another terrific performance is from a non-actor, Joseph Welch, the lawyer who challenged Joe McCarthy in the Army-McCarthy hearings, as the judge.  But this is Stewart's film and he is great.  If it wasn't released in the year that \\"Ben-Hur\\" won 11 Oscars, I think Stewart would have been a lock for Best Actor.  This was considered a very daring film with the conclusion of the case resting on the discovery of a pair of panties.  (I read once that Stewart's father was very unhappy with his son appearing in what he considered a dirty movie.  Supposedly, in protest, he removed Stewart's Oscar which before this had stood proudly in his hardware store's window.)   The extras on this dvd include a montage of scenes from the film, accompanied by the Duke Ellington score and a rather bizarre trailer, hosted in Hitchcock-style by the director, Otto Preminger, in which he makes the cast swear that this is a terrific film.  (Stewart looks kind of embarassed.)  This is a long, leisurely-running film clocking in at 2 hours and twenty minutes.  However you won't be bored.  And if I haven't said it frequently enough, Stewart is terrific.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|This movie portrays a romantic relationship (but \\"not a love story\\") between a couple which appears to be in their twenties.  The girl is named Summer and the relationship spans 500 days, hence the title.  The guy falls in love but the girl seems to be in it mainly for fun, though he seems justified in believing that the relationship could be and should be more than that.  As a result of these differing perceptions, we see the relationship gradually deteriorate, though the movie concludes with the unexpected possibility of a happy ending.<br /><br />But we don't see this deterioration unfold linearly, because the movie instead uses the device of presenting the story by jumping around among the 500 days, always indicating which day we're seeing.  The upside of this device is that we're able to clearly see the contrast between earlier and later stages of the relationship, but the downside is that this jumping around creates extra work for the viewer and I'm not sure it's always worth the bother.<br /><br />As I was watching the movie, I felt somewhat annoyed because the girl seemed to be giving implausibly mixed signals and being implausibly self-indulgent at the expense of the guy.  But at the very end of the movie, it dawned on me that the real reason I felt annoyed was that I personally experienced a miniature version of this story many years ago (it actually lasted for exactly one summer), so this movie was hitting close to home at a subconscious level.  So I have to admit that the plot is indeed plausible, though I still can't say that the story was enjoyable to watch, and I can't see why anyone else would enjoy it either.<br /><br />If the story isn't enjoyable, does it at least teach us something?  Perhaps.  One possibility is that if both people in a relationship aren't fully on board with it (after having openly discussed the issue), the relationship should be abandoned.  As the song says, \\"it takes two to make a thing go right; it takes two to make it outa sight.\\"  Another question the movie raises towards the end is whether the twists and turns of relationships happen according to a larger plan, or whether it's largely a matter of chance.  The movie subtly implies that a larger plan could be involved, and I lean toward that answer myself, however \\"nonscientific\\" that may be.  Certainly a question worth pondering ...<br /><br />Overall, I give this movie (almost) 5 stars for execution, but only 3 stars for worthiness of the story, so 4 stars net.  I can't strongly recommend watching the movie, and I won't be watching it again, but you might still want to give it a try if you feel compelled to do so.the movie raises towards the end is whether the twists and turns of relationships happen according to a larger plan, or whether it's largely a matter of chance.

I can't strongly recommend watching the movie, and I won't be watching it again, but you might still want to give it a try if you feel compelled to do so.
B0036B8MZU|5.0|I started watching this show for 2 key reasons.  I love anything ancient rome or greece and it's got Lucy Lawless in it, who I loved on Hercules and Xena.     While at first shocking in it's very real portrayal of life in ancient rome (Loads of graphic sex, graphic violence, you get the picture) - it is mind blowingly addictive.     My spouse, who usually avoids soap operish shows was intrigued by this show enough that we now watch it together. Score one for the gladiators in finding something new that brings us closer.    I really can't say enough good things about this series.  The cast is steller and the actors all deserve emmys.      Looking forward to season 2.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Andy Whitfield who is undergoing cancer treatment.  I honestly don't see how the series would be able to continue without him.
B000OUCI1U|5.0|I am compelled to recommend this book which deals with lessons concerning EGO: how to diminish it and have more positive personal, family, parental and even professional relationships, no matter who is on the other side of that relationship: friend or foe.     Most revolutionary to me is that Tolle explains how to be a thinker who doesn't focus on the ME in life. He advises how to unleash the need of control in personal situations as well as how to diminish and eventually release personal resentment. It's a really profound read and one that I believe I will reread once I have finished so that I more fully realize the messages. It definitely has quotable sentiments and needs to be highlighted for future reference! Lots of \\"Aha!\\" moments!      Tolle does a fabulous job of revealing how we, as people, can change our perceptions of each other and our situations by recognizing our own struggles with ego and how to acknowledge the way we feel and think about all things. I also appreciate that he doesn't take one spiritual opinion on life but chooses to appreciate and hone in on lessons from many spiritual historians, including the Bible.     I've had a rough year at work and even some personal and spiritual conflicts in 2010.  I truly believe that this book will help me to unleash a more readily positive ME, without worrying about what place I hold in every situation or how I'm going to change the world (I do think that I can change the world though and try to do soem small thing, a little each day. Darn ego!)     If you are one who is open to a spiritual realization of purpose, this is an uplifting read. If you don't have difficulty with your own EGO, my hat goes off to you because you are certainly a rarity. It may just give you a better realization of the positive person you are!     Amazon has used copies starting at $.95. What do you have to lose other than feelings of negativity, resentment, and hopelessness in those small places in your life. Sounds like a win/winto me! It's an enlightening read, to say the least!
B00005ABX0|5.0|Smiley Smile:<br /><br />If you are reading this review you have most likely read the other reviews of 'Smiley Smile' and gotten an overall history lesson on the aborted 'SMiLE' project and what came of it...so i won't bore you with another lesson.<br /><br />However, I will tell you how beautiful this album is: 'Heroes and Villains' - enough said; one of the greatest songs Brian Wilson composed. 'Vegetables' is a fun song FULL of bass - as a matter of fact, the whole album has more bass than Pet Sounds. I have a good sized subwoofer connected to my stereo system and this album is amazing to listen to with the bass full tilt.<br /><br />'Fall Breaks and Back To Winter' has snippets of the shelved 'fire' with a chorus mixing a woody-woodpecker laugh (done with harmonica) with a great drumline....I find the song to be a wonderful trip - others have told me it is the creepiest song they have ever listened to.<br /><br />Next comes 'She's Goin' Bald' - Out of all the wonderful songs on the album this is the one I skip every time...It is based around the instrumentals to 'He Gives Speeches' from SMiLE...for some reason Mike Love decided to change the lyrics (ironic he found Van Dyke Park's lyrics strange and then he goes to writing this - listen to it and you'll get my drift).<br /><br />From the bald song we go to one of my favorite tracks on the album: 'Little Pad' - it opens with laughter from the group and then goes straight into a wonderful chillax tune about wanting to own a little house in Hawaii.<br /><br />'Good Vibrations' - enough said. 'With Me Tonight' reminds me of 'Little Pad' - it is a mellow but wonderful tune. A toned-down 'Wind Chimes' comes next...a VERY mellow tune with an excellent ending. 'Gettin Hungry' is an amazing song with a great organ tune and bass line. A very different (from SMiLE) 'Wonderful' comes after - this version feels more haunting and mysterious than the intended version. 'Whistle-In' is a perfect chill ending to a very mysterious but enjoyable album.<br /><br />Wild Honey:<br /><br />I would describe Wild Honey as an ultimate Beach Boys jam session. The whole album feels so real and original; the sound is raw and somehow beautiful. The Brian Wilson who made 'Pet Sounds' and 'Today!' is still there, but now present are the other Beach Boys. Listen to the chorus on 'Aren't You Glad' or the many elements of 'How She Boogalooed It'....this is an allaround great album.<br /><br />5/5ould describe Wild Honey as an ultimate Beach Boys jam session.

031604461X|5.0|Im not going to lie I dont do that theres no point. I never read books I hated them I never could get into them. The first books that acctually took my interest was the harry potter set and they were brilliant ( Worth Reading) but then when this twilight series came out I never fancied it, to me it sounded like a load of rubbish but I didnt know much about it and so my judgements were wrong VERY WRONG!!! When I was told to watch the twilight movie I did and gave it a try, Well when it was over I was absolutely shocked and put it on to replay. I watched that movie till I was bored of it. Then for christmas I asked for the twilght series books, to my delight I got two of them, Eclipse and The Special Edition Breaking Dawn. Well i was made up and beagn reading the books I had bought myslef new moon and finished it in three days I could not put it down, I then read Eclipse and that took me two days to read, it was brilliant book the new born vamjpires and victora and then the volturi coven showing up as well it was jam packed with action and excitement. However the last book Breaking Dawn was the best of the series, how Stephenie Meyer created this world ill never know she's a brilliant writer.     This book is genious, when you read it you feel like you escape to another world, how she describes the scenery is brilliant throughtout the entire book collection, Breaking Dawn is written so beautifully and the descriptions she uses like the wedding she describes it as mere elegance and that everything is so perfect and beautiful, how she describes the feelings between Jacob and Bella are intense at the same time sadening by the fact that there is Edward and he can hear it all and read Jacobs mind which is just as depressing. Her descriptive language to show effectiveness of how Jacob fights his feeling for both Bella and Edward which is of course love an hatred, is superb and close to real life and close to how some young girls might think. The honeymoon is described delicatly but gets to the point and drives the fantasy of a young person wild and explores how much Bella wants to be human to remain in touch of her hormones which typically Edward is very aware of!!!   Jacobs section of the book is deep and more involved to start with because it details his feeling towards Bella and how the imprinting is irratating to him especially as one of his pack members has imprinted on his sister and is always around bugging him and making him angry. He is not very understanding to the whole imprinting because he thinks hes lost a chance with Bella as he truly loved her and doesnt understand her wanting to 'end her life' as he puts it, when she can be with him and stay 'alive'. When he sees her he is devastated when he notices the baby is killing her slowly and they have no clue how to stop it form her. He struggles to stay around but he knows it will make her happy and dosen't want to hurt her. When the time comes that there is difficulty with the baby in the womb she is imediatly taken upstairs to the hospital set up and get the baby taken out Bella sees the child and is so happy. With her know having to concentrate on becoming a vampire, Stephenie writes about Bellas pain and hows she feel engulfed by the fire and cannot escape and cant uinderstand why no one will put them out. when her tranformation is complete she awakens from her unconcious state she gradually hears the sounds with such precision and then sees the light and the srtips of light in the ceiling. she feels a hand reach out and is shocked and the full force of her vampire state is new and hard for her to get a grip on. she meets Edward as he helps out of the corner she flew into with her shock and is taken into edwards arms and then her gently kisses her that is different when he dosen't have to be gentle with her but her who has to be gentle with him to her surprise. How Stephenie Meyer describes their daughter Renesmee, is truly beautiful her warm eyes and milky toned face, her curls like Charlies fall form her angelic face and how Renesmee truly loves her mother and pines for her until they can meet. How Bella's anger is expressed becuase of Jakes imprinting and her nick name for her. Stephenie truly has a talent and will read anything she can offer in the futre. (I will not spoil any more I wanted to review this book to encourage others to read this but I do not want to spoil the ending as the best part comes up and even more excitment is packed into this book but it is an increable book please read this if you already haven't worth reading.)    Also by Stephenie Meyer The Host (good book so far form what ive read still reading though)!!! thanks for reading comment I take critism if you can be truly honest on my writing.  Thanks Jade
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My husband and I both love dogs and this was a very touching, warm movie.  Very enjoyable.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|So I was getting multicolored spots periodically down on side of page. The spots were in a regular pattern. Tried everything including replacing the toner and drum (it was past due anyway). Turns out the waster toner pack was jammed!! So it wasn't full... just jammed on one side with a ton of toner stuck against the metal roller. I tried to unjam and made such a mess, I gave up. So if you have non-horizontal line problems or vertical streaks, shine a flashlight on your belt. If its got lots of toner on it, it might be that the waste toner foam roller isn't wiping it off fully. Lift up the belt, and see if waste toner is jammed. I only printed 18k pages before this started happening. For only $22 it's the cheapest part on my 4070cdw.
0385737947|5.0|I read this book, and completely fell in love with it. I was given this book by our librarian, with whom I have a good relationship (friendship) with.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the book, I never put it down, I was sucked into the story that Dashner had created. I sat down and read it all day, seven hours, without even getting up except for the restroom at which point I was still so into it, I brought it with me and read it on the way.<br /><br />It keeps you interested the whole time, the suspense just about killed me in some parts, but to be honest, I did not love the ending. I don't know how it could have changed, but I just didn't think that was very creative. I also did not like the \\"I'll answer later.\\" all the time, or the \\"WICKED\\" thing. I couldn't understand why the creators would do that...<br /><br />Overall, however, I rate it 6/5 stars! Absolutely phenomenal book, highly recommend it.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Purchased this for my 23 year old daughter who watched this as a child.  She had the VHS but somehow left it at college.  I bought the DVD for her as a replacement, and she is so happy!    Great quality and value!
B002U1X9M8|2.0|This is a great book--highly recommended.  The problem is with the audio recording.  The reader has a lovely voice with good inflection.  Unfortunately, he does different voices for the different characters.  Particularly painful are his meek voice and Cockney-like accent for the heroine Lisbeth Salander and his island accents for the residents of Saint Georges.  Perhaps it is the result of bad voice directing, but in any case, this recording leaves me cringing...
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown has managed to cram every Bruce Willis DIE HARD and Nicholas Cage NATIONAL TREASURE movie scenario ranging from fairly exciting to absolutely ridiculous into his latest epic THE LOST SYMBOL.  We are confronted with a colossal dagger toting tattooed eunuch, a kidnapping, the bumbling CIA, the ever conspiratorial Masons and, of course our hero, the scholarly Robert Langdon who dances from place to place and clue to clue, while thwarting the bad guys, with the agility of a Nijinsky. (By the way, the solutions to many of the \\"puzzle/clues\\" are so elementary and their solutions so obvious that all Langdon manages to prove is that he could be a contestant on the television program Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader!).<br /><br />Brown's Langdon series of books are not to be confused with any written works containing artistic value since they are, for the most part, just a form of entertainment where you put your brain in park and go along for the ride.  On the plus side of the equation, the Langdon books are unlike his early efforts DIGITAL FORTRESS and DECEPTION POINT which displayed all imagination and writing ability of that aforementioned fifth grader. In general, all I can say is that Brown should get down on his knees every night and thank his publicist and his publisher for their unflagging promotion of his books.  There is an old saying which tells us \\"It pays to advertise\\" and there is no more obvious illustration of the truth of that adage than the phenomenal sales of Dan Brown's books.
0385737424|4.0|Actually, I surprised myself by thoroughly enjoying this book. This is why: 1) I rarely like any books whose target audience is middle-schoolers; 2) \\"When You Reach Me\\" is a sort of homage to Madeleine L'Engle's \\"A Wrinkle In Time,\\" a novel which I couldn't get myself to finish.<br /><br />It's a little hard to give a synopsis of the story. 12-year old Miranda's best friend Sal suddenly stops talking to her. The apartment key that Miranda's mom keeps hidden for emergencies is stolen. And then Miranda starts finding mysterious notes that plead her to write down all details of the events leading to Sal's estrangement and those that happen immediately after. The writer of the notes is adamant that these details will help to save someone's life...<br /><br />What follows is a very peculiar mix of mystery, adventure, and time-travel, a story about friendship, family, and growing-up. I am not sure what exactly I liked about the book, I just know that I couldn't put it down. I think it rightfully deserves the Newberry Medal it was awarded.
B0013V33DG|5.0|If you allow anyone who professes to hate opera watch this DVD you'll watch that opinion change right before your eyes.    Natalie Dessay is such an amazing natural comedienne that it's almost possible to  overlook her fabulous voice.  She can make something as mundane as ironing  funny.  If you don't believe me, you obviouly haven't see this DVD.    Juan Diego Flores is reliably heroic in every sense of the word, looking and sounding wonderful.  He'll have you cheering for every high C.    The plot is Gilbert and Sullivan-level contrived, but everyone in it is in fine  voice and is having such a good time, who cares?  This DVD is worth the price  just for the sight of Ms. Dessay as the army-raised title character trying,  without much success, to act like a proper lady.    Buy it for the comedy.  Be impressed by the music.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|After I got past the plastic housing and difficult to access battery compartment (I have since bought a 1 Spot...awsome!) the pedal works great.  Some reviews talk about slow response...I play bass and have experienced that on the Low B and E.  It seems to work and respond better after it \\"warms up\\".  Does not make sense to me, but after the first couple songs the unit seems to respond quicker.    For 30 bucks you can't beat it...but I can see where battery use and gigging heavy would cause some issues.
B00005JLEU|5.0|obviously you have to turn to the japanese for this kind of wonderful escapism, and Studio Ghibli are the boys.  This is the best of the the Studios pick.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I could only emphatically echo all of the other five star praise.  But does anyone else think that one of the most endearing, lump inducing scenes is after the fight and before the scorecard is read Rocky embraces his family and say's \\"let's go\\" and just leaves.    I almost lost it.  Talk about going out on your terms.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|If I wanted to be spoken to like a child by someone with a nasal voice, I'd sit in on a preschool class.  Oprah's horrible narration makes these otherwise stunning visuals nearly unwatchable.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This is a well-written, multi-layered series that drew me in completely.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys dialog drama.
B002RAREAK|3.0|I love me some Usher.  I have all, but one CD, which is his first one, and I love to listen to his amazing voice.  I don't know what Tameka did, but these last two Cds are making him fall off.  I don't know if Raymond vs. Raymond is better than Here I Stand or not.  There are a few songs on here that I do like, but I won't listen to it too much.
B0039OGGVQ|3.0|I bought this record and was of course instantly impressed with Slash's great guitar playing.  However, the more I listen the less I am impressed by the song-writing and production.  The songs really are not very diverse and sound the same. The production is very generic and it hurts the great sounds Slash makes with the guitar.  The biggest trouble is the song writing. There a few really great songs (Doctor Alibi, Gotten, Promise) but many are just weak and forgettable.  Buy this if you're looking for some guitar thrills but if you are looking for a real piece of art look elsewhere.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|The \\"Yheas\\" Have it over the \\"Nahs\\". The biggest issue with the \\"nah\\" sayers ,is the Voodoo thing in the film.  HEY, This was New Orleans back in the day. But I can understand  if some folks think its a bit too scary for smaller children.  You have a right to protect your child from things that may be a little too frightening for them.  But what puzzles me is some of these same people who say the voodoo was a bit too scary in this movie, overlook some of the scary stuff in a lot of  Disney   movies.... Plus a lot of other movies aimed at children as well. Lots of Disney and other so called kiddie pictures  have evil characters in them, especially Witches. Is witchcraft less evil then voodoo?  Non Disney movies like \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" terrified my little sister when we were kids. \\"Alice in wonderland\\" always seem like \\"Alice in A Nightmare\\" to me.  And the new Version in theaters now look more freakish and nightmarish then ever. To some kids as well as adults some things may be a bit too much, to others it won't bother.  But I give the \\"Princess and the Frog\\" 2 Thumbs up ,My kids enjoyed it, voodoo and all. The shadow man and his shadows were creepy but funny to them. Me too!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Another outstanding production from BBC!  I was hooked from the first epidsode and didn't want to stop watching until it was over!  I have never read the book so I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy of this adaptation so my opinion comes from having experienced the story for the first time.  The characters were very colorful and some were quirky which added a lightness needed in the story.  I love period dramas for their ability to transport you to another time and place and this production accomplished that very well.  Will watch again in the future!
1847674380|1.0|If anyone still has any doubts that this guy is so full of himself and drunk on power read this book. He totally forgets that he is half white and throws his Caucasian relatives under the bus. Many people think he is a cool, calm character, but I think he is like a deer in the headlights that doesn't know what to do. Makes me wonder how long he can keep his smoke and mirrors act going. His house of cards can't stand for much longer.
B00186JM7M|5.0|This is a classic crime/mob movie. A lot of people like Scarface but my preference was Goodfellas. The acting is perfect. The wardrobe is stunningly spectacular. The scenery, automobiles, and other details are exceptional. This movie is a must see and must own.
B001MW0J2O|2.0|I'll begin by saying that I had never heard of Animal Collective until I acquired this album.  Someone bought this for me as a birthday present on the recommendation of a local record store. I imagine she told them that I liked Pink Floyd and Radiohead. And it does make perfect sense as a recommendation - Amazon is currently recommending this album to me along with a ton of other artists that I love, namely Phoenix, Radiohead, Vampire Weekend, Yeasayer, XX, Spoon, and the list goes on. If I were judging an album by its cover art, I'd give this 5 stars. I got really excited when a reviewer said it was the best thing since Kid A. So why did I find myself utterly devoid of interest the first two times I tried to listen to it?    Especially after reading all the positive reviews, I felt like I was supposed to love this album, so I struggled with it for much longer than I normally would. I just felt like it was monotonous and dull, and the times when it did start to get a nice beat going, it didn't have enough energy. If I had stopped at 2 listens, I would have given this 1 star. But around the 3rd or 4th listen, forcing myself not to tune it out completely, the song \\"Bluish\\" finally cracked my distaste somewhat. After repeated listens to this song, and after looking up the lyrics, I like it. The line \\"I'm getting lost in your curls\\" seems to be one of the few moments when I could hear any emotion in the vocals. The song is subdued, but it has a unique, ethereal vocal quality that makes it stand out. I also got on board with \\"My Girl\\" and \\"Daily Routine\\" after many more repeated listens. They maintain a good beat and sound unique and interesting. Those are the three songs I would take from this album and look forward to listening to again. \\"Summertime Clothes\\" is OK, but sounds really generic. \\"Lion in a Coma\\" doesn't quite work for me, but at least it's different. The rest of the songs seem pretty forgettable and just blur together into a mess of uninspired electronic sounds and lazy, spaced out vocals. And certain songs like \\"Also Frightened\\" and \\"Guys Eyes\\" I actually find unpleasant and hard to listen to.  After \\"Bluish\\" is over, I have nothing else to look forward to on the rest of the album.    I got some enjoyment out of this album, but not enough to actively seek out any other music by Animal Collective.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The title says it all. Usually as you hit the 4th season shows decrease in quality, Dexter has the best writers and quality. Its sister show Weeds took a huge hit during its 4th season which translated into a bad fifth season, I don't see that happening with Dexter anytime soon.
B00337KM2S|4.0|Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) job is to fly around the country and fire people for companies who don't want to do it themselves.  He likes his work and his life, which is uncomplicated by relationships or domestic demands.  On one stop-over, however, Ryan meets a female version of himself (Vera Farmiga) and sparks fly.<br /><br />The success of this movie must be due entirely to the charm of its leading man, because it is in no other way unusual or special.  Clooney is indeed quite likable playing a slick smooth-talker while Farmiga is good in an undemanding role, but neither perfromance was  worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion.  The plot is pleasant enough, but hardly memorable, so I don't understand all the hype about it.  It was just okay for me and I've already forgotten most of it.  3.5 stars.
B0031TZBEC|4.0|The book is brief and fluid, a good review of Israeli economic innovation. This book did lose one star however, due to the sometimes excessive cheer leading that takes place.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was sorry to see this book end. I enjoyed the relationships between the slaves, families, and slave-owners. Lots of characters in the novel so the reader must read this book in a short time period. But that was not hard to do as it keeps your attention and has many plot twists. If you like societal issues and how they relate to families, get this book!
0887307280|5.0|This book should be required for all business owners. It moves the mindset of business development from being one of working \\"in\\" a business to working \\"on\\" a business. It provides quality understanding of how and why roles should be developed and defined within an organization, and uses an easy to read formula. Take notes - it's worth it.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|It's been said a lot on the reviews for Breaking Bad that this is another beautiful example of The Golden Age of Television, and I'm one to agree.  First, I'm going to say that Bryan Cranston takes this role to a level rarely seen on television.  This is as far from Malcolm in the Middle as someone could go--except for the whitey-tighties.  The story is riveting, the second season, which I believe everyone should buy, or prepare to buy, is extremely brilliant, and the third is just extraordinary as well.  I found this show when a free episode was playing at the hotel as a free rental.  I watched the Pilot episode and was blown away, I watched twice more the week I spent in that cramped little room.  It was the one good thing that came from that hotel.<br /><br />I think we should all be thankful for DVD's and the Internet, it is because of this that television has become so great.  Back before DVD's if you missed an episode you had to hope they replayed it.  That's why there weren't showsl ike 24, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, or The Sopranos.  Now, today, if you miss an episode, there are a hundred ways you can watch it again, from the internet, to Ondemand, to a few months later when it's released on DVD.  Because of this, we got the wonderful season long story archs, with each episode advancing the story forward.  Because of the DVD and the internet, we have Breaking Bad and I am thankful for that.
0385504225|4.0|I agree with most of the bad reviews I have read about this book.  So why did I give it 4 stars?  Simply because I don't read a lot of fiction, and when I do, I want to be entertained, and I want to look forward to reading the next chapter.  Well, I was entertained.  And I always looked forward to reading the next chapter.  Yes, I was disappointed in the ending.  And yes, I was able to see a few things coming a mile away.  But hey, overall, I enjoyed myself.  And that's what counts in my book.
0896898288|2.0|To start: Yes, I have read everything related to the CD problems, but I did not find a solution to the problem I had, which is that merely inserting the CD caused Windows to immediately shut down. You can't simply read template documents if you can't use your computer. Over and over this happened, because I could not eject the CD while Windows was shut down, and it took awhile to forcibly remove the CD so that my computer would again boot. As the book is constructed in such a manner as to be utterly useless without the templates, this is a serious shortcoming.<br /><br />In a comment to one of the reviews, I learned that you can download the zipped files at<br />[…]<br /><br />at least for now. But what about later? Will the templates be there in a couple of years? And templates are not the most accurate or efficient method of constructing most of these blocks. Measurements would have allowed an experienced quilter to produce many of the designs in a superior fashion, avoiding the handling of lots of teeny pieces. (These 6\\" blocks can have more than 30 pieces.)<br /><br />If you know anything at all about quilting, I think that you are better off with Jinny Beyer's new book, [[ASIN:1933308087 The Quilter's Album of Patchwork Patterns: 4050 Pieced Blocks for Quilters]]. If you know very little about quilting, I would suspect that you would get quickly frustrated at the tediousness and difficulty of template piecing with such tiny pieces. The absolute minimal thing that should have been done is including measurements. Then experienced quilters -- the ones most likely to finish the entire quilt -- could then choose the cutting and piecing techniques most efficient and accurate for each block. (For example, [[ASIN:B0018N4F3Q Triangulations 2.0]] makes constructing the numerous half-square triangles a breeze, and does them very accurately, too.)
B000002J09|5.0|They were at the top of their form on this album, nobody else could touch them at the time. I'm not 'song' oriented, I like moody and artful, so the 'Battle of Evermore\\" made this album for me, with its unusually creative guitar work and vocals. The short songs were solid- technically dazzling and impeccably produced.     Led Zeppelin was never really about lyrics- any end-line-rhyme fillers would do (as in most of rock), as 'Stairway to Heaven' so amply demonstrated (though that one went beyond the limit for me- they should have cut out most of the lyrics and gotten straight to Page's solo, which is why we of Led Zeppelin I vintage kept buying their albums- in hopes of Page bowing something sublime again, which he never did; and for John Bonham to do some creative drum rolls again, which he never did) (though he did get rhythmically creative on this album for those people who like to move their feet)...    This album's short party songs captured the next attention-deficit high school graduation class or two, and, since innovative music died when the FM stations dropped freeform programming just after the release of this album (greedy bastards- they saw how well this sold), it was played (along with other progressive bands from '69-'71) in safe, over-relied upon and ultimately boring and annoying station rotations until the end of the musically-sleepy decade... and from what I've seen from the one-star reviews, until the end of the century and beyond...! (the mainstream stations only stopped playing them in the 80's when they had enough decent new material, and that's when the 'Classic Rock' stations kicked in)...     As for those one-star reviews, most of those are a reaction to the reaction that the music created, or to the overplayed, uninspired, commercial rotations mentioned above, or fans of other progressive (which referred to experimentation and proficiency, by the way) bands of the period; other one-starers just prefer AM-derivative music- happy disco pop or ghetto or crooner or teen-bop or country or (for me worse, but maybe fresh and new in 80's/90's/00's minds) rock derivatives of derivatives of derivatives of derivatives of derivatives of derivatives of derivatives of derivatives of derivatives (though maybe I've been around too long- I can trace everything back to Chuck Berry), but I don't think it's that- because I remember in the '90's the studio heads flat out saying they wanted 60's pop-like songs (talk about unimaginative bottom-line industry people); and that's probably why Led Zeppelin never put out another album instrumentally like their first and became song-oriented; at least this album dared to create a few artistic moments that were a cut above 'marketable'...
B003DRWX9I|5.0|Since Guns 'n Roses the efforts by Slash have been mixed, but this one is definitely a hit.    Although there's an incredible variety of singers on this, the album actually feels somewhat cohesive. Slash's guitar sounds great and there is a nice mix of songs. I have listened to the album three times now and have enjoyed it more each time. This was a great concept and I'd love to see more of this from the great guitarist.
0312263511|5.0|Another excellent Astronaut book. Eugene Cernan and Don Davis wrote a great book.<br /><br />We see Gene's happy early childhood. Gene is a good student and with financial difficulty gets to go to college and goes in the Navy and becomes a Naval Aviator. He eventually gets his wings of gold and is carrier landing qualified. He is so grateful for the financial help from his parents to go to college. Gene's father is so proud of Gene's accomplishments but passes away before Gene walks on the moon.<br /><br />He marries his sweetheart Barbara and they raise a fine family. Barbara was Gene's rock and put up with many lonely nights and stuck with him and supported his intense lifestyle a long time. Later after Gene retires and still does not spend much time at home Barbara has enough and they divorce. Later Gene meets Jan who will be his second wife and they have kids. They live on a 400 acre ranch and raise cattle and horses and enjoy life with the grand kids.<br /><br />I've read almost all the astronaut books. Very little is said about the astronaut Roger Chaffee who never got a space shot and was killed with Gus Grissom and Ed White with the Apollo 1 fire. In The Last Man On The Moon we learn a little more about Roger Chaffee who was Cernan's friend and neighbor.<br /><br />Gene gets  into NASA and has a stellar career with a Gemini flight and the second US spacewalk. We learn that working in space is extremely difficult and if not done properly with rest and hand holds/footholds for leverage much exertion is used. No one knew what to expect and poor Gene had to fight a unwieldy umbilical life line/snake. Too much exertion, bulky spacesuit and fogging visor so he could barley see and he didn't even get to try the Air Force multimillion dollar jet pack and had to dump it. Valuable lessons learned and information for Buzz Aldrin to do a better spacewalk next time. Gene also goes around the moon and tests the LM with Tom Stafford and gets very close to the moon.Gene was also the back up commander for Alan Shepard's Apollo 14 flight and eventually becomes friends with the Ice Commander. Later on Apollo 17 he is the commander and does land on the moon with the scientist/LM pilot Jack Schmitt (Dr. Rock) with CM pilot Evans orbiting the moon.<br /><br />They actually had a small nuclear power device with them and the moon rover.( The nuclear device is extremely interesting. Read about DR. Zuberin's Mars Direct approach to get to Mars 5 stars and  using a nuclear reactor on Mars) So many experiments and rock samples taken by Gene and Jack. A hugely successful mission. Gene writes his daughters initials in the moon dust( where it will last for centuries) and tells her he is going to bring home a moonbeam for her. He names a crater for his wife, one for his daughter and one for his father. Gene really loved his family.<br /><br />We see some of Gene's mistakes like crashing a helicopter he was joy riding too close to the water looking at bikini girls. Gene almost gets killed ( drowned and burned alive). A narrow escape. At least Gene was honest with Deke the head astronaut ( who wanted to cover Gene with a failed engine story) and tells him he screwed up. All is forgiven and he still gets to go up. Also a few weeks before his  Apollo 17 moon landing shot Gene pulls a ligament playing softball and almost loses his chance to walk on the moon. Luckily the flight surgeon secretly helps Gene with ligament rehab and a prostate problem Gene had.<br /><br />Gene retires as a Navy Captain as he didn't want a desk job/Rear Admiral position and he was too senior to be a captain of an aircraft carrier. He also retires from NASA as he didn't want to get involved with the shuttle program.<br /><br />Gene tells us it was a shame that we didn't go back to the moon and eventually go to Mars but eventually we must and will. Its in the human spirit to explore. He hopes someday some of the young students in classrooms that he talks to will grow up and be astronauts to the Moon  and Mars.<br /><br />I wont ruin the wonderful ending of this great book. Ill just say Gene is holding his grand daughter and both are commenting about the moon and there is a wonderful ending. Read it to find out.This was a very enjoyable book and Don Davis is to be commended telling Eugene Cernan's story and showing us Gene as a real human being with strengths, faults and weaknesses like we all have. Eugene Cernan a real American space hero.ing of this great book. Ill just say Gene is holding his grand daughter and both are commenting about the moon and there is a wonderful ending.

B00337KM2S|3.0|A very truthful movie but slow and somewhat disappointing.  Commercial hype got to me and I just expected more as did the rest of my family that watched it. Award winning, I think not!
0340822783|5.0|By far the best thing I have read this year.  The book is an interlocking interconnecting series of 5 novellas, each one broken up into two parts.  If you think of the novellas as A, B, C, D, E and F, then the chapters of the book lay out A, B, C, D, E, F, F, D, C, B, A.  The chronology of the stories, starting in the 1850s, and ending in the very distant future also lays out A through F.  The astonishing thing is that each novella is written in an entirely different style, and yet each one strangely connects and echos the others.  It is a tour de force, really.
B000I0QK74|1.0|I ordered two CD's at the same time coming from two seperate locations, along with paying for the quick ship delivery charges and I have yet to find the James Taylor CD.  Pretty bumbed out about that.      8-(
B0006B2A42|3.0|With such an assembly of actors and a director who knew his stuff, I honestly expected more from a film taken from a great book, but sadly it didn't do the book or the cast justice.<br /><br />Where was the exciting fire aboard the submarine after the rescue? It had gone. Instead we had a company of Russian troops being parachuted down to confront a company of US Marines who had been carried on the submarine to the Ice Station (neither the Russian or the American troops had been in the book) and to me it seemed the show-down between the two sides was as frustrating as the storyline; great potential but nothing really happened - it was like opening a huge box of a present and finding a tiny uninteresting object inside.<br /><br />It would have been better to dispense with the pointless confrontation between the two armies and concentrate on the story of why secret agents from the UK and Soviet Union were there anyway. What about the characters of the Ice Station? Almost ignored and passed over, they were just names, yet Ernest Borgnine and Patrick McGoohan knew each by name, and as these two guys were spies it stood to reason the blokes on the Ice Station were also spies or at least in cahoots, and would have known something.<br /><br />Too much made of making it like a Cold War stand off and not enough injected into it of a man hunt between the protagonist and antagonist. We had a brief flash at the end but by then I'd lost interest and couldn't care who was what or what happened to them.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Being a fan of the Biggest Loser, I thought I'd try one of Jillian's dvd's. This is my first experience with a Jillian workout. LOVE IT.  I have several workout dvds from Denise Austin to Billy Blanks to the Firm. This 30 Day Shred is my new favorite. The workouts are 30 min including warm-up and cool down. The moves are simple yet challenging and highly effective. I have never seen results so quickly from any workout.   Highly recommend adding this one to your collection. Note: You have to actually do the workouts fairly consistently to achieve any results.
B002XHN776|3.0|I love 30 seconds to mars but this cd isnt as good as the first few cds. I dont find myself wanting to listen to evey song over and over again like the first cd. I really like maybe one or two songs on this cd were on the first 2 or 3 I loved every single song.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I just got the Bluray edition of the Godfather and to be honest Im still shocked of how good it looks and sounds. I would agree with most people, this movie is grainy, but is part of the movie and it will always be. I do have to say this movie has never looked this good. I have them on DVD also, and the difference is so noticeable, is truly amazing, I personally didn't expect it to look this good. Im glad I bought this movie once again, is a great buy and if you are a Godfather fan, you most definitely buy this collection on bluray.

B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|This is yet another genius and instant anime classic to come from Studio Ghibli. Based on the Disney classic Areal, Ponyo follows the same basic storyline but in a different and original way. Like other animes by Hayao Miyazaki this one also contains a strong message about taking care of our planet and keeping balance in the world. The animation was great, the story had depth and value, the soundtrack fit the story and evoked the right emotions at the right time, and the character development was there. This is a great anime for all ages, appealing to children, teens, and even finiky young adults. A definite must have for any anime collection!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is one of the greatest Romantic/Comedies I have seen. And it looks and sounds even better on blu-ray. This is a great movie for someone you love around the holidays. Great cast.
B00354Y9ZU|1.0|(This a a re-post of a comment I made on another forum that is not likely to be seen by anyone else. Since it essentially boils down to a review, I'm going to post it here instead of writing another one.)  ---------------------  I'm reading this book now and \\"losing my mind\\" trying to see Seth's point of view. I inhabit the world of the cogs (and I indeed did not plan to end up here and I do not want to turn my brain off at work) so I know for a fact that several of the assumptions that he's basing his theories on are wrong. I also noted how the book conveniently mentioned the lizard brain as a judgment to foist upon those of us who disagreed with his premise. I will not accept that judgment.    Not all companies value linchpins and creative thinkers. To some, they are just troublemakers. Also, my job and many other cogs may be *defined* as unskilled, but the reality can far different. Is it as skilled as that of an architect or engineer? Of course not. But to imply that those jobs are the new norm/middle ground and broadly define those of us below that level (at jobs that *used* to be considered professional) as unskilled, stings. And I refuse to wear that label. We live in a world where our university economies have been pumping out masters degree graduates and Ph.Ds doing endless postdocs, while most of our new jobs are in the service sector. It's my belief that underemployment is mostly a structural problem, not a personal one that points to lack of creativity, initiative, or energy on my part (plus living in MS and being obligated to stay here doesn't help... but this is another common problem for the cogs; lack of money and responsibilities to family usually prevent them from fleeing to other states or cities where they can practice their talents)    I've only gotten about 1/3 through the book so far. I'm going to hope that his message gets a little easier to swallow or that at least he no longer insults people like myself. The audience of this book is definitely not people like me. I see it as upper middle class/white collar pablum to appeal to people who have little experience with being poor and being stuck being a cog. To me, only people who have never really been smacked down by illogic and outright theft of their ideas, money and future can say things like you're stuck being a cog because you *won't* change. (for example, I see students at the university I work at who literally have their parents *steal* their money from their checking accounts and savings, open up credit lines in their names and ruin their credit -- sometimes before they ever even get to college.) Changing your life requires at least some measure of resources to do so. Stating that we *all* can do it if we want to...baloney.  No such thing as \\"can't\\" may hold true for a percentage of society, but that doesn't mean that it really doesn't exist.  One-hundred and fifty years ago, try saying \\"no such thing as can't\\" to a slave.  Their lot in life changed not from being all \\"engaged\\" with their work.  It came from the \\"uppity\\" ones that fought back, escaped, and the white abolishionists.  It came from a president that refused to allow the country to participate in forcing a populous to be property.  And later it came from another president who sent armed troops into Mississippi to demand that the state follow the laws of the land.    I have no problem with the personal message to completely engage yourself in everything that you do.  Giving with no expectation of being noticed or rewarded is the only way to go.  So, on a personal level, be courageous and give your job and anything you do your full attention and go the extra mile.  But the reality is that most people will  take advantage of you, your job excellence will redefine the expectations of your position to a new higher standard and you and others will be judged more harshly.  Clueless managers will likely not know how valuable you are so they'll lay you off with equal frequency as all the non-linchpins.  (Unless you spend time in self promotion and schmoozing around your company which would seem to be the opposite of being a linchpin to me).      This review is by a cog, who lives in a world that no matter how creatively you work and how much involvement you try to get in your job, your management will not let you participate because you don't have the purchased credentials of a masters degree.  You will be left out of meetings, your ideas will be ignored, creativity frustrates them because you're acting uppity, and you have no hope of promotion no matter what you do.  This is my reality.  I still engage fully with my job even though it bores me to tears.  I still try to be creative and think of things we could do better, but I have to find a \\"higher up\\" to sponsor them.      To sum it up, on a personal level, I thought Seth's ideas were spot on.  A no-brainer, but worded in an engaging and positive manner.  But equating them to becoming indispensable and less likely to be laid off in the corporate world was a stretch; one I just couldn't make.  There's an old saying...something like, the graveyard is full of indispensable men.  Ultimately, no one is indispensable.  The irony is that we are all remarkable snowflakes; beautiful in our individuality, but all utterly replaceable no matter how far up the food chain you rise.  For us cogs, that point is driven home very early in life.  I also resented what appeared to be an assumption by the book that those stuck in cog jobs were resistant to change, not engaged in their work, or unskilled. Saying that there's no such thing as \\"can't change\\" is akin to blaming a hostage that they can't free themselves from their imprisonment. Sure, some people wouldn't run if you killed the criminal, opened all the doors and laid out a red carpet and flashing neon directional signs. But most folks...just give `em a little wiggle room and they will indeed rise to the occasion.  Ultimately, there is nothing wrong that we live ina world where we are not all Nelson Mandelas.
0307463745|5.0|This is an amazing book. I can not stress enough that every person, regardless of your industry, needs to read this book. I have taken ideas contained within this book to heart. Thanks to Jason and the other guys at 37 signals for putting this together.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book so much I had to write a review to balance all this negativity.    I didn't really hear about the whole Twilight phenomenom until the first movie came out and resisted reading any of the books until I saw Twilight for sale for $2. I figured that wasn't a lot to pay for my curiosity and picked it up. Well, I was hooked from the start. True, the writing could have been tighter but the story was incredibly compelling - even for a 36 year old like me.    I savoured the Twilight books and only now finished Breaking Dawn, a few months after reading Twilight. For me, Eclipse was disappointing, I hated that Bella was in love with Jacob, but this was incredible. Immediately after reading it I went online to see what others thought, surely they would all love it like me? I was shocked to find this wasn't so. How could so many people out there, over 1000 on Amazon alone, hate this book? It was by far the best in the series and an incredibly entertaining and engrossing read.    I have some theories. It does seem that there are some demographic differences between those who hate it and those who don't. It seems to be largely an age split. Young people hate it, older readers love it. I can see why. Unless you've lived a little, had a little life experience, Bella's choices and Stephenie's choices will seem incomprehensible to you. I loved this book because to me it felt like the characters finally grew up. Less of the teenage angst, more of an adult perspective on life.    Let me address some of the specific issues people seem to be having (SPOILERS):  1. The wedding.  People complain this was a let down because it was described so poorly and Bella seemed to show so little interest in it/reverance for it. Ok, look, there is little description because the book is from Bella's point of view. The whole day is a blur to her, she doesn't notice things, we get as much description as she is aware of! Secondly, why on earth would she suddenly find the whole wedding thing special and wonderful when she didn't want to get married in the first place?   2. Dropping out of college/getting married/having a baby at such a young age etc.  Bella is not meant to be a role model - she's dating a vampire and in love with a guy who turns into a wolf - how can she be? Her choices are related to the unique events and circumstances in her life.  3. Lack of sex/too much gore.  We don't need explicit sex in this book, I liked that it was implied. If you want explicit sex go read an ADULT book. This is for YA. As for the gore, was it really that bad? It is shocking yes, but did you really think Bella dying was going to involve nothing but a sexy bite on the neck?  4. Jacob's imprinting.  Sigh, it is not creepy, it was foreshadowed in the book with a previous example and it was explained MANY times that is isn't a sexual thing. Please, don't bring your own prejudices and fears to something innocent.  5. Bella suddenly coming over all maternal/the child being unrealistically perfect.  First, anyone who has ever been pregnant will tell you that the moment you get pregnant, everything changes. Even if you've never wanted children, strange things happen. It's called hormones. And in Bella's case she's carrying a supernatural being. Its whole goal is to be born safely. Of course it will use its \\"powers\\" to create a strong bond with Bella, just the same way Edward can \\"dazzle\\" her. Second, Bella GREW UP. She's more maternal and caring because she's matured since the first book. Third, the child doesn't act like a normal crying, stressfull baby because it's fully self aware and hugely advanced for its age. Why doesn't anyone get this? Oh and she calls Rosalie for help because she knows Rosalie would protect the child because she previously said she regretted never being a mom. Did other reviewers even read the books?    I could go on, but you're probably bored. I didn't mind the child's name, Stephenie's reasons for it are explained on her website. I didn'tagree that characters made 180 degree turns that didn't make sense, I just felt they matured or changed due to the life experiences they were experiencing. The book felt much more mature than the previous three and I related to the characters better because of that. Bella and Edward's relationship evolved into something less angsty, less all consuming for Bella, that's exactly like real life! Look at the other couples in the book, look at real life. The first obsessive crush doesn't last, it evolves into a strong, quiet love. And being a mother changes you, it's why Bella wanted to save her child over and above anyone else including Edward.    I don't believe Stephenie broke any of the rules of her world either, again you can read her website to see how she jusifies all her decisions. She knew where things were going long before writing Breaking Dawn so she deliberately didn't set things up that would make the whole pregnancy impossible.    If you're a simliar age to Stephenie and me (36) you'll get this book, if you're a young reader you will lament the passing of an innocent angsty teenage crush, feel grossed out by the gore, hate the whole pregnancy storyline and wish the book had ended in a huge fight.    Me, I like the happy ending, I'm fine with everyone getting what they want. I didn't want a huge fight where everybody died. I like the escapism of YA fiction which is usually devoid of large amounts of sex and death. This book made me feel happy and safe and left me with a glow. The earlier books just depressed me.

B000002KIE|5.0|Or, hey hey, we're the punkees.<br /><br />I was a young man in school when an issue of Rolling Stone landed in my hands with the intriguing cover story \\"Rock is Sick and Living In London.\\" It chronicled the rising punk rock movement in England and prominently featured The Sex Pistols. I was already into the Ramones, so finding a copy of \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" was high on my new \\"to do\\" list. I went out and found a copy and was utterly blown away. It was loud, angry and had attitude to burn. All my friends into southern rock? They could eat my shorts after I heard \\"Anarchy In The UK.\\"<br /><br />While Malcolm McLaren was the provocateur who put these four men together (the legend goes that he put Johnny Rotten in the band after auditioning to Alice Cooper's \\"I'm 18\\" in front of a jukebox), there's no way to deny the ferocity that The Sex Pistols made as a band. (As reference. McLaren's other discoveries were an early version of Adam and The Ants and Bow Wow Wow, hardly the stuff of legend.) It's Rotten's demonic \\"right! Nowwwwwwww\\" that opens the album and it's his snarling laughter that comes off as something the then 19 year old was not faking. Add the infamous antics that the band became famous for and soon the band were running wild through Europe.<br /><br />When listening to \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" over thirty years later, it shows some wear. However, the ballistic singles \\"Anarchy In The UK,\\" \\"God Save The Queen,\\" \\"Pretty Vacant\\" and \\"Holidays In The Sun\\" have lost none of their brutal impact. McLaren and the band used every opportunity to rub the staid noses (and ears) of prim and proper music with exploitative music and imagery, with Rotten's anti-singing and charisma being the lead instrument. Guitarist Paul Jones was a secret weapon, as he was cracking guitar hooks that were simple but devastating, supporting the manufactured mayhem with musicianship that was often ignored by the antics.<br /><br />McLaren may have been the Svengali (so long, R.I.P. you scoundrel), and The Sex Pistols and band jimmied together for maximum impact, but the chemistry and timing were perfect. \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" stands toe to toe with such breakthroughs as the MC5, The Stooges, The New York Dolls and The Ramones as bands that redefined rock and roll attitude. The one and only album they ever did defines a moment and a legacy for all involved.ols and band jimmied together for maximum impact, but the chemistry and timing were perfect. \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" stands toe to toe with such breakthroughs as the MC5, The Stooges, The New York Dolls and The Ramones as bands that redefined rock and roll attitude.

0446691437|5.0|I bought this book because the author wrote one of my favorite novels, \\"Gates of Fire.\\" I figured whatever inner flame drove this man to create such a work of art might stoke my fires a little. I needed it. I started out my adult life with a lot of warrior spirit: I worked as a cop, and had deep training in the martial arts. As my life became more intellectual in nature (physics isn't very physical), I lost a lot of that warrior spirit. This book helped me to get some of that youthful vitality back.<br /><br />Pressfield correctly anthropomorphizes the inner demons which cause people to fail. Resistance is that little inner voice that tells you to watch TV, or have another drink, or eat another cupcake, or pick up another goofball at the bars. Resistance eats up all of your life, until there is nothing left but resentment and despair at what you could have been. Is Resistance a real monster? Yeah, I think it is. Not objectively real: I'm an atheistic materialist, but it's the part of your brain that makes you a slave.<br /><br />It's no joke. Most people are pretty much zombies because of this. All because they can't sit down and do work without someone else making them do it. Something inside screams at them not to; something inside wants them to sit and rot. Sometimes it appears outside; unless you live in ancient Greece, almost everyone around you wants you to fail. The longest you'll live is about 35,000 days. How many of them did you waste?<br /><br />It is only as you get older you begin to notice the effects of the monster. You get this growing pile of small projects you started, but never finished; pieces of your life, wasted. You notice that you forgot to keep in shape, and so you have become a fat person. You notice that your plans to do this or that never quite materialized. Most people understand the consequences of their inaction on some level. Most people never do anything about it. They sit around, nervously waiting for the monster to eat them. At best, they ossify into a vaguely functioning form.<br /><br />The solution? Pray to the muse, and do the work. It sounds absurd: my neighbors probably think I'm nuts reciting passages from Homer every morning, but it works. I don't think there are real angels that come down and put ideas into my mind, or protect me from monsters, but the psychological act of reaching for a higher power for assistance is something men have done from time immemorial.

B002VECM4A|5.0|PRECIOUS    I have always been a fan of Tyler Perry and any thing he puts his hands on, so of course I had to see this. I knew that this would be great when Perry was announced as a producer, he was the main reason I wanted to see this. Then I found out that Mo'Nique was starring in it, which made me really interested since she is a comedian. Needless to say I was not disappointed by this film at all, this is a very powerful film. I also must say that the hype this film received was well worth it, at least in my eyes.    The film follows the life of young Precious who is a mother trying to better her self in school and such. But her home life is not that grand with an abusive mother and her mother's boyfriend who rapes her. So we live her life with her feeling her pain being there for the downs but also for the highs. She finally meets some people who truly want to help her and her journey is an increasingly interesting if hard to watch one. From her mother to teachers there are people affecting her life for better or worse. This great film is based on the novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire.    I must say that Gabourey Sidibe did a marvelous job as Precious and gave a truly award winning performance. She gives a truly hauntingly wonderful performance and you can see every emotion she pushes forth. I hope she has a wonderful career and continues to get roles like this, she will no doubt win an Oscar one day. Also the now Academy award winning actress Mo'Nique portrays one of the coldest and most interesting characters ever on film. She defiantly deserved the Oscar because this was so far off from her usual career. I am absolutely impressed by her and I hope she does more serious roles because she may win an Oscar for leading lady one day.    Also in the film I was actually impressed by Mariah Carey, I was not a big fan of her movie \\"Glitter\\" I think it was called. She did a really good job in this film as did singer Lenny Kravitz, I was impressed. Paula Patton as well did an excellent job in this film and really added another level to the film. It should also be said that all of the students in the film were really well cast as well. Geoffrey Fletcher did a great job turning this into a screenplay and director Lee Daniels did a marvelous job.    This is a very hard film to watch at times with a lot of bad things happening to this girl, but it is a great film. It has been a long time since a film like this has come out, glad to see things like this come out. Tyler Perry was great to get behind this thing and I am glad that I went to see it. This is a great DVD with some good extras including a great commentary.
B000URDEB0|3.0|Dark Passion Play being Nighwish's 6th studio album and 2007 release is the first without Tarja Turunen. The sound is still symphonic power metal but Anette Olzon is not as accomplished as a vocalist as Turunen. The booklet is quite busy and sometimes less graphics could have been included. All the lyrics are included and some very nice photographs of the band. Allmusic gave this release 3/5 and I agree. Even so the album was a massive hit and topped the charts in several European countries. 3/5.
B0030BYWKU|4.0|Really like this cd, but him singing his name at the beginning of many songs is really irritating and so self indulgent.  I realize this is his debut cd so singing your name on one song at the beginning of the CD would be acceptable, but doing it on the majority of the songs is almost a deal breaker.  I do like the rhythms in these songs and the previews of his songs all grabbed me right away.  He is very talented, just stop with announcing your name at the start of every song.  I'd give this cd 5 stars if he didn't do that.
030745455X|3.0|THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO was an original, dark, mesmerizing mystery: part \\"Godfather,\\" part \\"Clue,\\" part Tarantino film, it was a violent thriller with a dark sense of humor and some genuine heart.  THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, the follow-up, is suspenseful enough, but has little to make it stand out from the crowd.<br /><br />I'm not even sure how to summarize the plot, considering that, since the plot doesn't even start until 200 pages in, anything I say would be a potential spoiler.  Let's put it this way: Mikael Blomkvist has decided to investigate sex trafficking.  Then something goes wrong, and people die.  And thrown into the mix is our young heroine Lisbeth Salander, a girl with a dark past, who is intimately tied with the proceedings of Blomkvist's investigation, even if she hasn't spoken with him for over a year.<br /><br />FIRE is thrilling; there's no doubt about that.  It's 700+ pages fly by.  And we get more insight into Salander's past; the revelations are dark and haunting, and the book's subject--the flesh trade--is certainly a mesmerizing one.  But at times, the novel comes off as a bit of investigative reporting in itself (we even get footnotes, though they were added in by the editor and not Larsson).  The book can't really decide, at times, what it wants to be: an expose on sex trafficking, or a suspenseful thrill ride.  The end result is some unforgivably bad prose, and quite a bit of unnecessary repetition.  One can't really blame Larsson for that, however; these are the kinds of things all authors deal with, which is why they have editors.  The problem is, the editors/translator probably felt inclined to leave such passages in, in some strange tribute to Larsson's memory.  What they should have is pared the novel down.  The extraneous details that made DRAGON TATTOO so enthralling merely seem redundant here.  TATTOO was a mystery, and had the room for detail; FIRE is a thriller, which by their very nature tend to be lean and mean.  THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE is anything but lean.  Still, even for its flaws, it's a good enough read.  You could do far worse.ED WITH FIRE is anything but lean.  Still, even for its flaws, it's a good enough read.  You could do far worse.
0393072231|4.0|I purchased the book about half a week ago and i am almost done with it. It is a good book telling you the behind the scenes accounts of what went on in the financial markets. I'll admit that this is only the second book i've read on the topic, the second being Dean Bakers book \\"Plunder and Blunder\\" on bubble economic. From the reviews it seems some people prefer to know who made the most amount of money shorting the market, but this book gives you a good account of where the insight into shorting the market started and how the tools for shorting the market were developed.    The one reservation I have of this book is that it buys into the notion that people at Goldman Sachs are \\"smarter\\" than people working in the rating agencies, which Michael Lewis describes as \\"dumb\\". I would argue, though i obviously don't have the proof, that there was mass corruption between Goldman Sachs and the heads of the rating agencies. For example Michael Lewis reports on a lady working at Moody's who would send hundreds of CDOs up to her bosses asking for lower credit ratings only to get back lower credit ratings on a few percent. As is typical with the corruption between government and the financial industry, I would look in the future to see where some of these executives working in the rating agencies land jobs and their future bonuses.    This book has changed how I look at the bailout. I now believe that none of these institutions should have been bailed out. Investors who were openly lied to should have been helped out with the liquidation money of the institutions. CEOs and people beneath them should have at least been sent to jail with the key thrown out.

The pace was poorly directed and the ending was so very predictable.  I'll give it some credit as the apocalyptic scene was cool to watch, but an hour long?  Really?

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I was looking at another headphone advertised in a magazine, but I knew I needed to search Amazon for reviews of similar headphones. Sure enough, reviews had this item near the top. I didn't know headphones could do this, wireless with excellent surround sound. I'm not certain if I can distinguish the 7.1 myself, but who cares. It sounds brilliant. Playing shooters, you will have an advantage. You can truly hear the footsteps around you for a quicker reaction. You also hear sounds you never thought existed. Now you can truly appreciate the sound designers work in each game. In regards to the crackle and pop issue, I get it once in a while, but it doesn't last long. It is usually when you first turn the xbox and the headphones on, and it goes away once you get through the game's intro screens. Highly recommended for people that want to be drowned in the game without disturbing the outside world. The chat and mic work well too. The mic is so flexible, it never gets in the way.

B001GMH8SI|5.0|I love this movie.  These days I often think about abandoning everything and heading North (it's where I am from anyhow).  I think I have a lot in common with the lead character, good for him for having the courage to do what he did.  Yes, he didn't have enough know-how to do it safely (he did die because of that).  These days I think I am lucky to still have a job.  Unfortunatly I am working away from home and fiance, putting roads in, paying on a house that is $100,000 under its value.  I often feel like just giving up, I don't know what I am working so hard for.  Whats the point of anything we do in our lives, whats our goal in life?  This movie goes past that, he could have had an excellent education, which in this country means a comfortable lifestyle (that you still have to work long hours etc...)  He turned away from all of that, he wanted adventure and thats what he got.  I am the mirror image of this and suffer for it!  Paying on a house money that I will never get back, working away from home because the situation with the houses drained the economy.  It just isn't right.  So I see eye to eye with the films main character, maybe my adventure is yet to come.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|Okay, so my husband and I saw this movie and thought it was weird because Spiderman weirds-out on us.  The second time I saw this movie I thought, \\"That was actually a pretty good movie.\\"  I'm a Spiderman girl.
B001QERPDO|5.0|I only buy an entire CD if there are more than half of the songs on the CD that I would play again. I normally listen to albums thru a subscription service and just download individuals songs. After listening to this CD via a subscription service I immediately came to Amazon to purchase this CD. This is a classic first album and I expect we will be hearing a lot more from The Script.  It has the flavor of The Police with a soulful quality. I can't believe this CD has been out for over a year. I let several of my friends and family members listen to this CD and everyone loved it, young and old.  Totall worth purchasing!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|When we went to see this movie I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical.  So many pictures today are so politically correct and try to send subliminal messages, but Disney once again did a movie in the old traditional way; it told a story and told it well. The characters and scenery were really well drawn and the songs were as usual very catchy tunes.  There were many endearing characters in the movie that children will love.  I would definitely give this movie an A+.  It had everything to entertain children.  It also was refreshing that for once the movie didn't have any hidden potty jokes or tried to entertain the parents, too with some humor only they could comprehend.  This was a movie intended for children and one the whole family can watch together.
B00007FOMP|5.0|I finally picked up \\"What's Going On\\" at age thirty, and I can now easily say that the old maxim that we become less impressionable to getting into new music after college is a fallacy. I quite literally have had this album in my laptop at work for eight months with barely a break. \\"WGO\\" is a true concept album, about all the social problems of the 70s; problems that continue to plague us today: war, pollution, poverty, child neglect, religious issues, drugs, racism...did I forget anything? Gaye's soulful poetry is as pertinent today as it was in those days of Vietnam, cocaine and rampant environmental destruction.   The album was responsible in many ways for soul music's message spreading to the community at large. I also enjoy it a lot for the variety of emotions that Gaye displays (and you can't help getting into his groove), ranging from an almost-disco hipness on the title track to the ethereal air of \\"Flying High\\", and the plaintive sadness of \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" and \\"Save the Children.\\" I can't help feeling sad and angry whenever I hear \\"Mercy,\\" with the lyrics about oil spillage, fish full of mercury, animals and birds dying in the face of choking pollution; Gaye implored that the world do something about it, but it has not gone away.   However, neither has Gaye's message gone away, and it is because of great musical bards like him that we will forever be reminded that the problems of the past and the struggles of the human condition have always been the same.
B0018ARMWU|5.0|This was always on of my favorite albums, and it always kinda pissed me off that people give it bad reviews. Yes it is different than typical DT, but that's why this album is one of their greats; IT'S MUSICAL!!!. As much as I love classic DT, there are points in their music when it just sounds like a warm up exercise. Yes they are gods of talent and technique, I am not stating otherwise (Petrucci is my favorite guitarist.. I own his MusicMan and plan on buying another), but to listen to them play 60-70 minutes of modal scales with varying time signatures and poly-rhythms (if you don't understand any of that you don't even have the right to criticize), on the verge of almost being atonal, can get old and boring. I didn't buy six degrees for that very reason- it was repetitively boring and sounded generically DT.     While learning advanced guitar techniques, I read an article about what separates advanced players from advanced musicians is the ability to apply technique musically. There are thousands of guitar players who can get on stage and shred the Phrygian Dominant mode, but very few of can make it sound musical. Likewise, there are some absolutely talentless players that can make their crap sound good (Koban anyone?). If you listen, or even better, play the music on this album, you realize that despite the non-traditional sound, it is still extremely complex and clearly DT. Petrucci still rips up solos, Portnoy still adds poly-rhythmic flare, Derek Sheranian doesn't use some of the stupid voicings Rudess does (sorry, but I think Rudess is the worst keyboardist DT ever had). I also thought Petrucci demonstrated, more than on any other album, what most blues/pentatonic plays accuse him of not having- finesse. Listen to the solos (lines in the sand is a great example) and you'll notice that he is playing more than you think, but he blends it beautifully. To apply his machine-like technique in such a musical way is clear proof that Petrucci is an absolutely amazingmusician.    All in all, I think this album demonstrates DT's ability to play anything. Kind of the point of prog rock is not to be bounded to any parameters when writing music and to expand into different areas to blend styles; so in turn, anyone stating this album was \\"sold out\\" or too main stream is being hypocritical to the idea of the progressive style. Were all the songs my favorite? No. If they played an entire album of Anna Lee and Hollow Years type music I don't know if I'd buy it. But it is nice to hear Dream Theater expand into a little variety and play music they don't play on every other album. Kudos boys.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Taking more than five years to conceive and over two years to make, AVATAR should probably and will most likely go down in history as a modern-day classic. The theme of the film will probably last throughout the ages, as it is as relevant to our culture and it has been for centuries in the past among the beginnings the Native Americans as they have had a profound connection with the land they lived and worked on. AVATAR's theme focuses on just that, the connection the natives of the planet Pandora have with the biological inner-workings of it, and this is a staple of the movies attempts at connecting with the audiences' hearts. The Native indians always held that the land was sacred and it became a way of life for them to worship it and protect it at all costs (it was considered wrong for them to kill or harm a tree).  This is just what Jake (Sam Worthington) discovers as he becomes more and more connected with the sheer beauty of the alien palnet Pandora and their gentle population, the Navi'. He also, as a DNA matched fit-in with his own Navi' body (An AVATAR), finds and falls in love with a beautiful Navi' girl who shows him the way of her people until he finally becomes one of them like they are with their planet.<br />  The beauty of this film is that James Cameron doesn't make these parallels stated without us discovering them as the film progresses, and we watch, in horror, as a futuristic American military posted on Pandora denies any of the beauty associated with the planet and plans its destruction for its own monetary gain.  This process of discovery is a trait not found in too many movies today as we are taken on a journey to a foreign land but are made to be involved and engaged in our hearts and minds as the true narrative of the story unfolds.<br />  The film is stunning in scope and cinematic wizardry, using todays best state-of-the-art technology to bring film-animation to life, and in 3-D as well.  The film deserves all the attention it has gotten and is sure to be a classic along the lines of a Ten Commandments or a past Cameron classic Aliens. Cameron is to be applauded for making Earth's military the villian without making them guitless.  They may not be shown to care about what they are doing to Pandora and see how wrong it is, but they are certainly shown to pay for it, and that guilt for which they suffer for should be enough for us.  The ending is sad yet we cheer at it, and you will see why. Sigourney Weaver as the lead bio-scientist may not be the star but her part serves as the backbone for the anger and betrayal felt by some of the American soldiers and scientists who are forced into an ultimatum at the films final hour, and what an hour it is, it is the finest series of action sequences ever filmed, sure to make you sweat and truly feel for the natives of Pandora. Let this film go down in history as Cameron's best to date, and lets hope he has more in store in the future.en and is sure to be a classic along the lines of a Ten Commandments or a past Cameron classic Aliens.

031606792X|3.0|I read all 4 books in this series in quick succession and very much liked Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse (Eclipse is my favorite).  I thought the continuing story in each book was suspenseful and I liked that it was told in 1st person, giving us Bella's thoughts throughout the story.  I also thought the first 3 books flowed very well and I couldn't put them down.  Breaking Dawn, for me, broke the spell as I found the story choppy, disjointed and a complete shift in the writing style.      This was the only book that wasn't told completely in Bella's view as the middle was told in Jacob's POV.  This change made no sense to me; if anything, it would have been more logical to hear Edward's POV, not Jacob's.  I love Jacob in this series but I always wanted Bella to be with Edward even though Jacob was a very close second.  With the pregnancy and birth storyline I felt that Edward and Bella became secondary characters from that point on in the book.  And when Edward had no choice but to change her to save her life during the birth the story became bizarre because after that Bella wasn't Bella anymore.  It all happened too fast - I wanted Edward to change her as it was the only way she could be with him but from that point on, the entire story changed.  Bella was suddenly super girl vampire and she fell into this without missing a beat.  She could do anything, jumping easily over lakes, immediately hunting for food, controlling herself around mortals and everything else with no problem.  I found this to be ridiculous; it would have been more believable to have Bella gradually adjust to not being a human and not have the pregnancy and the birth of Renesmee overtake the whole story from that point on.      In the first 3 books, we had Bella going to high school and falling in love with Edward and the story progressing well.  In this last book I loved the wedding and honeymoon scenes but that was the last thing in Breaking Dawn I enjoyed.  All of a sudden Bella not only becomes a vampire in an extremely gross passage but she becomes a mother almost immediately after marrying Edward.  Edward was relegated to the background after Renesmee was born and so was their love story.  I did not like Jacob wanting to be with Renesmee which seemed very distasteful to me.  I'm not sure if Stephanie Meyer wrote this because Jacob didn't get to be with Bella but it made no sense to me and ruined Jacob for me after that.      Bella's father, Charlie, who was a big part of the first 3 books became almost comical in Breaking Dawn with his \\"only tell me what I really need to know\\" and everything's fine since I'm a granddad change of character after Bella had the baby.  I thought this was totally unbelievable from the way Charlie acted in the other books and I also wondered as I was reading Breaking Dawn what happened to Bella's mother, Renee, who became missing in action (did she fall into a black hole from that point on)?      The rest of the book was okay but again, giving so much time to introducing the reader to all the different vampires and telling their stories for the battle scene did not seem to fit well into Edward and Bella's story and it felt to me like this was just added on.  The battle scene was boring and anticlimatic and the part about Bella's throwing some kind of \\"forcefield\\" was unbelievable - superwoman and new mother, Bella, look out Volturi!    Breaking Dawn would have been better if it could have been lengthened into 2 different books, part 1 and part 2, in my opinion.  And it would have been much better if we could have heard Bella's thoughts in becoming a vampire and if she had insecurities and endured some sacrifices from the radical change in her life.  It would have been more realistic if we could have read about Bella's pain not being able to see her parents anymore.  Not making her life such a piece of cake after she becomes a vampire would have made more sense.  The book had a good ending but all in all, I didn't like Breaking Dawn and wish Stephanie Meyer would have written it in a way that would have followed the style of her other 3 books.  Breaking Dawn had too much going on and the entire book didn't flow well - I found the story hard to accept and I was disappointed reading it.

I had purchased many books to read to him, hoping to find one he really liked, and I won the lottery with this one.  This is the book that he looks for and brings to me to have it read to him.  He loves hearing me tell him the sounds the animals make, and after reading it several times, he now tries to imitate the sounds himself, which is adorable!!
0061124265|5.0|Veronika's flirtation with death after a failed suicide attempt turns this novel into a commentary on sanity and life.  Coelho's philosophical and poetic narrative illustrates that \\"...society always imposes on us a collective way of behaving...\\" and that those who think and act contrary to the norm cannot be considered sane.  This idea is defined by outlining the histories of three of Veronika's fellow mental patients who, through their interaction with Veronika's imminent death, come to acknowledge and embrace their own deficiencies.  This allows them to surrender themselves to the rarity and majesty that is Life itself.  The vehicle Coelho uses to convey a simple yet profound message is elegant.  He captures humanity, its desperation and fallibility, through a handful of mental patients who are forced to examine their existence and reevaluate themselves.  This novel is another example of why Coelho is such a prolific and highly respected writer.

0307454541|4.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is the first book of a trilogy by Swedish author Stieg Larson. It is a very unique story of mystery and a thriller and at the same time presents a pictures of contemporary Swedish society, previously totally unknown to me, and in particular that of big business and journalism, the social / buerocratic system and 'high society'. Once you get past the somewhat slow beginning, the book becomes an exciting page-turner.<br /> There are 2 protagonists: Mikael Blomkvist, journalist for \\"Millenium Magazine\\", a middle aged liberal divorc&eacute; who has just been found guilty in the Wennerstroem libel case and Lisbet Salander, a 24 year old strange 'punk' computer genius and hacker, who seems to be a ward of the state, without family. Lisbeth is pathetic with her mode of dress, piercings and tattoos and general strange conduct, a virtual misfit, but as the book progresses, becomes a more and more likable character. Blomkvist remains a colorless strange character who likes women, has a married lover, and does not discriminate in whom he beds.<br /> When Blomkvist resigns from his editing job at Millenium Magazine because of the bad publicity the litigation has created,  he is hired by a Henrik Vanger, 'fortuitously', who happens to be one of Swedens wealthiest industrialists, retired, to officially 'write a family history', while in reality delving into the mysterious disappearance of his niece Helen, over 40 years ago. It seems a strange request and hopeless undertaking. What follows is an exciting search leading to unexpected confrontations, serial killing, corruption and misuse of power in the highest places. What is guilt and what is innocence and what is justice? Lisbeth becomes Mikael's side-kick and invaluable and together they solve what has to be solved..........of course there is a very surprising ending to this story, but it has occurred to the reader off and on, that this scenario could be possible..........<br /> This was a very exciting book and I was very glad there was a sequel.<br /> What I found objectionable was, that the many Swedish names for places and streets and things were not translated into English in the novel. It would have made it much more interesting to know the Engl meaning. I also found it very strange that they seem to drink such prodigious amounts of coffee in Sweden at all hours of day and night.I was very glad there was a sequel.

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this album.  I had heard that Slash was working on a solo project, and enjoyed Velvet Revolver, so I was anxious to hear it. I have to say - I really like it.  The guitar playing is solid and crisp.  I don't know that every song is stellar but, taken as a whole, this is a great album. Stand out tracks for me are:    Crucify the Dead (with Ozzy Osbourne) - It's hard not to like a collaboration between Ozzy and Slash - 'nuff said.     Beautiful Dangerous (with Fergie) - I was pleasantly surprised with how well Fergie slipped in to \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" - it's got an infectious hook, without losing it's edge. (Fergie delivers the closest \\"Axl sound\\" on the record with the chorus to this track.)    By the Sword (with Andrew Stockdale) - Very enjoyable track with a distinct Zepplin vibe.       Starlight (with Myles Kennedy) - This is that type of song that plays best on a warm summer night, driving 60 MPH down a back road, with the windows down.      Overall, the songs are comfortable, and that is what I like most about this album.  It's what you want from Slash - and it's hard not to wonder if this is an echo of what we might be seeing from G'N'R today, had it not collapsed under the weight of Axl's ego.  This album helped confirm for me that Slash was the heart and soul of what I loved about G'N'R.  I'm glad he made this record - highly recommended.

B003F3NDOE|5.0|It was Thursday night in September. The weather was nice, not too cold, not too warm. TV on the other hand, well, at that point its Thursday line-up had a lot to be desired. So I turned on Wheel of Fortune to see if the woman who was up $10,000 would hit the bankrupt slot or guess that the answer was \\"Granny's Homemade Apple Pie.\\" Usually I would flip through the channels during commercial breaks, but like I said there was nothing else on. And then I saw a commercial that caught my attention. Popping up on the screen of my television was a 20-some odd girl with big blue braces, red glasses, and frizzy hair. \\"Ugly Betty! The world premiere at 8/7 central!\\" the narrator declared. And I decided to watch. 9 months 11 months later I found myself purchasing Ugly Betty - The Complete First Season and then 14 months later I purchased Ugly Betty: The Complete Second Season and then a year and a half later I purchased Ugly Betty: Season 3 and then I found myself watching season season 4.<br /><br />And it wasn't too long before I found myself reading on Wikipedia that the brilliant, award-winning show was cancelled by ABC. Once again, ABC cancelled a great show. At least we got four seasons out of this one. But before I continue I just have to put this out there, SPOILER ALERT! In season 4 we open up with Betty getting her braces removed, but of course it was just a dream. We see her getting her new job has a junior-editor. We see her getting back together with Matt (with whom she broke up with in the season 3 finale). And as we go on further into the season seeing her house burn down. I wouldn't be able to tell you how the series ends. The reason for this is  simply because, even after owning the DVD for two months, I cannot watch the series finale, and see this great show end.<br /><br />But, spoilers aside, I own the DVD* and am able to tell you about it. The DVD comes in a small, average DVD package with a sleeve over it. This annoys me a little, because the past DVD releases came in large sandwich-style packaging which I liked. The past releases also had more discs, even season 2's little amount of episodes(18 because of the WGA Strike) came in a five disc set, whereas this 20-episode, final season comes in a small 4-disc set with 5 episodes crammed on each disc.<br /><br />The special features include commentary with Marc Indelicato and Micheal Urie on one episode (not the finale), the featurette \\"Betty Goes Bahamas,\\" \\"Mode After Hours\\" webisodes, bloopers, and deleted scenes.<br /><br />All-in-all, \\"Betty\\" was a great show and will always deserve 5 stars, sandwich packaging or not. I recommend this release for any \\"Betty\\" fan who wants to get Ugly one last time.<br /><br />*The information about the DVD was published on October 28th, 2010, months after I purchased and received the DVDrge sandwich-style packaging which I liked.

1439190275|1.0|Most healthfully eating vegans have amazingly great lipid profiles. In 25 years, when I did Atkins, my total cholesterol soared for several years to 203 in my 40's. In my late 50's it stays at 139. Atkins lovers, whats yours? Vegans who eat 9 or more servings of plants daily, yours?<br /><br />Interesting to see how this \\"version\\" of Atkins has morphed into so many more veggies. I wonder if the veggie versions are really Atkins at all? Sounds like an \\"Eat to Live\\" or other popular decades-old veg books on the market wannabe.<br /><br />To the person that suggested Dr. Campbell had enlisted his fans to write? Quite the opposite. We tend to be a well-read bunch, reading everything we can get our hands on, pro and con, to escape bad genes and family fates. Many of us even have Google alerts set on these topics.<br /><br />BTW, found out just this week that my second sister has breast cancer. So that makes me the only adult woman in my family without it!<br /><br />Recap: Mom, aunt, 2 sisters: breast cancer. All grandparents, parents and 1 sister: Major heart disease, diabetes. All women: osteoporosis. Grandparents and mom: Alzheimer's. Me: I win 5K races for my age group and do half marathons. Did I get all the good genes? I think not. Many of us don't have time to wait for 100 studies on broccoli. Oh that's right, there's no money to be made in broccoli. :)

B002N8A14M|1.0|I'll start by listing the major design flaws:  1. Many headphones (like the Sennheiser PMX80) either won't fit or won't fit snugly due the way the bottom of the case is designed.  The default Apple headphones fit fine.    2. The case consist of two plastic pieces.  There is not a locking mechanism for the two pieces, but a one slides snugly into the other.  I suppose that this is for quick removal.  However, the clip is attached to the top of the case and when the bottom piece disengages, the ipod comes tumbling out.    Ok, so the positives:  1. The armband works with the clip.  The clip basically clips-ons the armband.  This means that you can reuse the armband with any case that has a clip.

B002VKE1K2|1.0|When I heard all the hype for this movie, I had a sense of deja vu...it took me back to 1999, and a little film called \\"The Blair Witch Project\\". Yet another movie hyped to be \\"superscary\\" that was anything but. All but the last 10 minutes were just an ass-numbing bore. Even then, those last 10 minutes were hardly what I would call superscary...I've seen scarier stuff on Youtube.     Basically, this movie is a good hour of watching people sleep, with some weird noises thrown in. Oh, you also get to see them eat, surf the internet, etc....Yaaay! I only paid $1 to rent this from Redbox, and I considered trying to get that back.     I didn't buy into the hype, and was glad I didn't. It's a turkey.
B003B02PF4|5.0|I've read a lot of Grisham, and always enjoyed it. This book is the cream of the crop. Not only did I feel that I was right there in Italy, I could feel the Broker's pulse pounding.

B002ZG983M|5.0|The advertising campaign promoting this film has misled you.  First off, it's even funnier than you're expecting.  Secondly, it's really and truly not.<br /><br />I have never in my life witnessed a film that so successfully blended laugh-out-loud comedy with heavy, intensely graphic action and dire drama, and Kick Ass will often switch amongst all three in a single scene.  It's wise to bring tissues to the theater for when the coke splurts out of your nose from intense laughter, but you may need it for wiping away a tear, as well.  And it will definitely come in hand when the guy behind you jumps up and screams \\"F--- YEAH!\\" while accidentally knocking his cup onto your lap.  Kick Ass is likely to provide all three experiences, and it is truly and unexpectedly a cinematic triumph as a result.<br /><br />At the heart of this mixing of genres is Nicholas Cage's character, \\"Big Daddy,\\" who effortlessly alternates amongst surreal and unbalanced father of the year, dead-on Adam West impersonator, and poignant tragic hero without blinking an eye.  I've never liked Nicholas Cage prior to seeing this film (even I'm not sure why), but I just became his biggest fan after watching this.  The rest of the cast does stellar work as well, but this film couldn't have soared the way it does without Cage's presence.<br /><br />Beyond that, the camera work, editing, and soundtrack all do an incredible job of keeping you glued to the screen throughout.  If you're coming to this film looking for yet another easily assembled (and easily forgotten) spoof film of the season, you're likely to find yourself barking up the wrong tree.  I'm going to smack myself for saying something this cliche, but, for lack of better terminology, Kick Ass kicks ass.<br /><br />One obligatory warning in this otherwise glowing review: Kick Ass is not for everyone.  If you have a problem with graphic violence, particularly when it involves children, stay far away from this film.  Hit Girl, who appears to be 10 or 11 years old, is far from your standard side-kick who watches safely from the sidelines.  In fact, most of the graphic violence and death depicted in this film are thanks to her character.  Yes, there is a message in this film that the way she has been raised was neither healthy nor appropriate, but it's likely to get lost in the cheers and laughs that are elicited by her many exploits.  In general, the major issue that seems to separate these characters from their fictional heroes, even more than their naivety, is the fact that they see no problem with killing criminals.  Don't expect a heavy-handed Batman moral about not stooping to bad guys' level, either.  These guys pick up just as many guns and fire as indiscriminately.om your standard side-kick who watches safely from the sidelines.

B002RDCEX4|5.0|just so good, and i've been lucky enough to see them live.  They don't seem scared to play out tracks a bit more progressively.  'Soldier On' is just amazing, takes ages to build up, but worth it.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|DO NOT buy the Oprah/Discovery version.  Get the original, ummolested Bluray BBC version with David Attenborough instead - it is a truly \\"once in a lifetime\\" experience.  Mr. Attenborough's style and cadence fit the subject matter like a glove - you can *hear* his passion and enthusiasm for the material.    How and why the fratboy marketing majors at Discovery Communications got the bright idea to overdub naturalist David Attenborough with Oprah baffles the mind.  Perhaps they hoped her name would bring her built-in audience.  Some have theorized they wanted to avoid alienating the creationist fringe in America by erasing naturalist Attenborough's presence.  Whatever the case, her monotone cadence is just awful, totally devoid of any emotion or care.  It's really like you're taking in two different, competing things that are clashing rather than meshing with each other - amazing videography and then an obtrusive lady babbling and you just don't care what she's saying.  It's clear she came into the recording studio, started reading from the paper in front of her and put absolutely ZERO heart into it.      I have watched both versions for comparison.  First the BBC version narrated by David Attenborough (spectacular), and then the Oprah version overdubbed and broadcast by Discovery on TV.  My wife and I were floored, we couldn't believe our ears - the material was absolutely RUINED.  And my wife actually *likes* Oprah's daytime show.    On top of all that, they're trying to charge people more for the Oprah version.  Un. believable.

B002DKF47O|2.0|First of all let me say that Behemoth is pretty good (not the best). However if one is o grade them on this cd they'd miss out on some actually pretty decent albums. This cd was just NOT GOOD. The main song \\"Ov Fire and the Void\\" would rate just barely at 3 stars. Not other song on this cd was toleritable at all. I'd say Behemoth has reached its peak at Demigod. And begain a steady decline after Apostasy. Behemoth as a whole is a hit or miss band, meaning its not worth buying albums by them because only some songs are good. Go and download the best songs individually.     Songs worth your time:    -Be without Fear  -Prometherion  -At the Left hand ov God  -Conquer All  -Demigod  -Slaves Shall Serve  -The Reign ov Sheshmu-Hor  -Chant for Ezkaton 200 E.V.  -I'm Not Jesus  -From the Pagan Vastlands  -Decade Of Therion  -The Dark Forest Cast Me your Spell)  -Dragon's Lair (Comsmic Flames and Four Barbaric Seasons)  -Antichristian Phenomenon  -The Act Of Rebellion  -Natural Born Philosoper  -Christians To the Lions  -Vinvm Sabbati  -23 (The Youth Manifesto)  -As Above So Below
B000URDEB0|5.0|Some people will argue that Nightwish has gone soft by bringing in someone like Anette and changing their style of music. I think it's just different, but still sounds good and very well put together. The only thing that is missing are some of their newer songs. Give it time to get use to the new Nightwish and I'm sure you'll love it. I'm both a Tarja fan and an Anette fan.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I have no major problems with Oprah in general, but the observable fact is inescapable:  She is terrible at this.  I mean, wow.  Just, wow.  This is the worst narration for a nature documentary I've heard since that clown on the Extreme Animals show.  Monotone and boring, it sounds like she's talking down to a three year old the whole time.    This is an excellent, excellent show to purchase, but I highly recommend you get the original British version with David's professional and more engaging narration.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|never have i not been able to finish a book. i guess there is a first for everything. and this was it. i found the plot tedious and boring. it was like reading a school assignment. it may just be the fact that the story takes place after susie's death that i found too weird to relate to. or it may have just been the fact that i found almost every character extremely annoying. i would say to pass on this book. even though the free sample was good enough to get me interested in the story, it became increasingly boring from there on...
B000PKG7TI|5.0|It's the last time you will see Tarja Turunen with Nightwish ever again. It's a must have DVD for all Nightwish fans. Ofcourse don't expect to hear all the great songs you've grown to love, and also don't expect the quality of the songs to be like that of studio recorded albums. Just watch it for the ambience that Nightwish always brings to their concerts. Loved Stone People & Creek Mary's Blood. I know, it's true about the documentary being dull, but I kinda like it, seeing fans around the world embracing the great music of Nightwish. Get it before it's gone.

B000063IQP|1.0|It's hard to do a review for an album you dislike, from a band that you do like.  Hardcore fans will tend to dismiss your review, because you may know less than they do about said group, they just disagree about your opinion, or you haven't qualified your response by discussing the basis of your understanding of the group or CD.<br />I know less about Tangerine Dream than many of the reviewers on this forum, that I will admit.  Although I definately have some knowledge of the band and own 10+ albums from them also.  For the most part I find Tangerine Dream's albums fit into 2-3 different styles.  The first, and my favorite, would be the longer 20 minute tracks with generally 2-5 songs on the record (Pergamon, Green Desert, Phaedra, Rubicon, etc).  The second would be your shorter, newer, 5-7 minute songs that are far less epic, and to me seem a bit faster paced and definately less interesting (more commonly known by the TDI moniker).  The 3rd style is kind of mix between the two represented by the albums Exit or Underwater Sunlight (both of which I would recommend).<br />So why don't I like this CD?  I don't think this actually music.  It's like a nature sounds CD with background noises and musical accompaniment.  There just is really nothing here to be inspired about, especially for the price.  I'd like to say this CD is OK, but after about 10 listens I never throw this one in, especially when I have 10+ superior Tangerine Dream albums to choose from.  (As an aside, this may be a 4th style of Tangerine Dream; that of early non-musical, quasi-noise oddities, for lack of a better expression.  I have not yet heard Electronic Meditation, or Alpha Centuari, but those albums also seem less liked than the most popular Tangerine Dream records with reviewers saying something similar to what I'm saying here.)<br />For Tangerine Dream first time buyers, or those with a CD or 2 and are wondering where to go next I would recommend the following: I loved, Pergamon, Green Desert, Ricochet, and Encore.  I also liked Exit, Underwater Sunlight (considered by many their best effort), Stratosfear, and Force Majeure quite a bit.  Lastly you couldn't go wrong with, Phaedra (considered by a different many their best effort), or Rubicon.  Whichever you chose from this list, it would definately be better than buying Atem.  If you truly must buy Atem, and I do understand the possible reasons why.  Maybe you are a completionist, or it was too good of a deal to pass up, whatever.  But, if you plan to buy this album, take my advice and make this CD one of your last Tangerine Dream purchases.

030745455X|5.0|One of life's great pleasures is finding a good book. To find two in a row is exceptional good luck, but this is the case when reading Stieg Larsson's The Girl Who Played with Fire right after finishing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Both volumes classify as the best books of the year in my opinion. Larsson's writing is excellent, and the translation comfortable to read. His characters will go down in literature as outstanding. Just try to forget Lizbeth Salander! The manner of plotting both novels is fresh and clever and they flow together. Each can stand alone, but they blend so well, it adds to reading enjoyment to read them in sequence. I will leave the outlining details to the many other reviewers who have covered them well and simply conclude with the recommendation to beg, borrow, or buy (help the economy and booksellers) your copies, cancel any upcoming events on your schedule and prepare to be entertained, enlightened and educated for the period of time you will spend reading Larsson's work. It's hard to wait til May for the next, and with regret, the last volume of this terrific trilogy.
B003B486OY|3.0|The third book in the trilogy. Again the twists and turns and the sub plots made for very good reading. I haven't read crime in a long time, so for me it was refreshing to read these three, set as they are in Sweden. I was intruiged by the Swedish culture eg. their constant consumption of coffee and I enjoyed how Lisbeth and Blomkvist evolved as the storyline unfolded.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This package includes a BLU-RAY Disk, a DVD and a disk to allow you to download it to your computer or smartphone or IPOD which is nice depending on what technology you have laying around the house.  The movie itself is a great family movie.  It was wonderfully done.  It deals with love, the grieving process, what is the nature of a family and has lots of adventure and action scenes with enough comic relief to break up the tension when it gets to stressful.  One hint to look for is that the movie is divided into four sections.  Section 1 is introducing the main character and has dialog and seems to be set in the 1930's and shows few months of the main character's life as a child.  Section 2 is done silent movie style and zoom through about six decades of the main character's life.  Section 3 is probably what most folks think as the \\"movie\\" and does take up most of the running time even though it actually occurs over the space of probably less than a week's worth of the main character life. Section 4 is a little sneaky as it is contained in the credit section and shows a series of family snapshots along side the credits and lets you know what happened after the \\"movie\\" ended.  The animation is wonderful. The story is fun.  You really wonder sometimes why kids movies do not win oscars for best picture after watching a movie like this.  It certainly was better done and much deeper, more thought provoking than most of the movies nominated for best picture and maybe better than some of the movies that won best picture.  But I guess UP is just a little too much of a \\"kids\\" movie to be taken seriously by the Hollywood elite.  Oh well.
030745455X|3.0|I enjoyed this second book in the trilogy just as much as the first. The plots are intricate interwoven and very suspenseful. It is racy reading that I enjoyed over the christmas break. I found the characters intruiging. These characters live in a different world to mine yet Lisbeth held my sympathy the whole way. If only retribution could be so just! Blomkvist seems a very believable journalist and probably based on Stieg Larsson himself although it seems not his sexual exploits. Maybe it was just Larsson's fantasy in more ways than one!<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
0140620540|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering.

Of course it was a little (a lot?) farfetched, but we are hooked and are now reading the other books, in the proper order.  Alex is a likeable character and one that most pre-teen/early teen boys can imagine being like.  There's more violence than I would like but it's that kind of book, and it's something many boys this age seem to enjoy.    As a bonus, the Alex Rider books count for several points in the reading program at school.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Zombieland ia not just a zombie movie. It tells a story of a young man's quest for identity; his effort to find who is is and where he belongs in life. It just happens to be told in a world where zombies have all but completely taken over America, making every day, every hour, every move, a vigilant struggle for survival. It also happens to be cleverly and irreverantly funny. Take National Lampoon's Vacation, combine it with The Breakfast Club, and mix it all into the flesh-eating, blood-dripping world of zombies... and that's what you get with this intelligent and hilarious movie.

B000002URV|4.0|I had this tape in the 80's and we couldn't play it enough.  I bought it for nostalgia.  Now I think a lot of the CD is not as \\"spiritual\\" as I used to and it has that synchronized sound but it is still good music.
B002ZG977Y|4.0|I've never seen the original Clash of the Titans so I really had no expectations going into this remake. So while I can't vouch for it's faithfulness to the original story I can say this film is 100% fun from beginning to end.<br /><br />The plot follows loosely the story of Perseus and his rebellion of his godly heritage. It's not a very complicated plot, in fact there's not much to it than the whole lone outcast hero saves the world (or city in this case) against overwhelming odds. I don't think this is a bad thing at all. I realise after last year being spoiled with socially grounded spectecles like District 9 and Avatar (sort of) it's nice to see a high-end adventure film that doesn't have any hidden agenda. This isn't to say the film's mindless, it's actually got a very engaging tale to tell. You just won't be drawing any links to any modern political conflicts.<br /><br />Another great thing about this movie is it's acting. Sam Worthington is becoming my favorite action star (especially after his terrific work in Terminator 4 and Avatar). He's got more charisma and presence than any other action-hero actor out there and is a perfect choice to play Perseus. Ralph Fiennes also great as the alternating creepy and over-powering Hades. Gemma Arterton is well cast as the angel-faced Lo, who act's as Perseus guide and conscience.<br /><br />With the uncomplicated plot the special effects and actions scenes become Clash of the Titan's bread and butter..and man do they rock! I don't know why when dealing with big monsters in film they always make the criters look kinda cheesy. This is NOT the case with Clash of the Titans. The giant scorpians look deadly, Medusa is just as creepy as her backstory, and the Kraken gives you that \\"holy-crap\\" moment few films can pull off. The special effects are even put to good use when introducing the gods (Hades killing off Perseus' family is brief but particularly memorable).<br /><br />So while Clash of the Titans isn't going to win any big picture awards it is a hell of alot of fun. I never saw it in 3D nor do I want to. The special effects are just fine the way they are. There's nothing deep here, just good actors, good action, and a great sense of adventure.a hell of alot of fun. I never saw it in 3D nor do I want to.

B0038P59A0|3.0|The answer is not really. Either they are too boring to entertain... or they lack a certain charm. I've never seen a Sherlock holmes movie that was worth remembering.<br /><br />This latest flick was a good attempt. It had the right amount of action and interesting concept...but the plot was too scoobydoo-ish and uninteresting atleast that's how I felt about it. Not a bad movie... just one that could have used a more interesting story. The action scenes were always overshadowed by the \\"zzzzzzz\\" plot that wasn't worth caring about. Maybe if they dropped the cartoonish back from the dead plot and added in something with a bit more of a serious tone the movie would have been great...you know like Lethal Weapon good with Danny and Mel. A semi comdey with serious action in it. I didn't care too much for the ambigious relationship holmes had with watson...for the moment I thought Holmes wanted watson to plant the ring on his finger.<br /><br />Decent film... worth watching... renting... maybe owning if it's cheap.<br /><br />Just average film though.<br /><br />P.S. I'd like to add that I couldn't understand half of what \\"Sherlock Iron Man Holmes\\" said as his thick forced british accent and mumbling made him sound like a mix between Jack Sparrow,the Dark Knight, and Mr. Belvedere (thats right I took it to the 80's).
006621131X|5.0|I'm not the biggest Patti Smith fan...in fact, I don't even own any of her music.  Yet, after Rolling Stone ran an excerpt from this book, I had to get it.  It's a fantastic read, poetic yet accessible, much like Patti herself.  Highly recommended.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The title of the book made me doubt however once I stared reading it was hard to stop, the title is perfect. About 1/3 it gets a bit slow with to many names, dates and places but hang in there it starts getting a hold of you tighter and tighter. Excellent twists and turns. Scary to think what some people can do with a computer. I hope the other books by Larsson are as good.

0679720200|5.0|Camus primarily explores two issues in THE STRANGER. These are the \\"gentle indifference of the world\\" and the element of the absurd--that is, A could occur and your life would move of this path; or B could occur and your life would be completely different.<br /><br />These issues are embodied in the experience of the Meursault, the narrator of this two-part novella. In Part I, Meursault appears oddly detached from life. He is distant and unemotional at the wake and burial of his mother, does not mourn her death, and has superficial social interactions. Then, when walking with two men who he barely knows, he participates in a brief brawl, where one of his acquaintances is knifed. Meursault and his acquaintances leave. But he returns to the scene of the fight where he, perhaps inadvertently, encounters the perp with the knife. For a moment, anything might happen. But then, the immediate contents of his life--the death of his mother, his anger at the fight, his need to defend himself, and the bright and brutal sun of North Africa where he lives--explode in his act of murder, which is sensationalized in the newspapers.<br /><br />In Part II, Camus explores what has happened. Is the murder the action of a detached psychopath, as the prosecutor contends. Or, is this the act of an ordinary man, who in an emotional outburst kills someone. As Meursault's lawyer retorts as the prosecutor builds the case against his client, \\"...everything is true and nothing is true.\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, Meursault's acquaintances testify on his behalf, credibly attributing the murder to chance or bad luck. And, Meursault, alone in his jail cell, begins to reveal a sensibility that, while apparently detached from life, also richly values the commonplace qualities of mundane experience. He is a lover and poet of the ordinary, who like the world, is \\"gently indifferent.\\"<br /><br />The final chapter of THE STRANGER is absolutely great, with Meursault affirming his commitment to life's beauty and gentle indifference, not capitulating to pressure to endorse Christian dogma to lessen his ordeal.<br /><br />Not a thought out of place and highly recommended.d gentle indifference, not capitulating to pressure to endorse Christian dogma to lessen his ordeal.<br /><br />Not a thought out of place and highly recommended.
0975991477|5.0|The book cannot be looked into from purely scientific perspective. Author has tried to bring out role of supernatural that definitely exists in our lives, through the scientific insights he gained over a time. No doubt several details cannot be explained because nobody, nor will ever, gain insight into them because nothing more remains to be explored if the source of energy that propells every single living thing moving in this universe, is identified ....God would have revealed himself and all humans, upon understanding the basis of life and energy, will immediately become lifeless forms with no desire and nothing to explore/grow. It is still a great attempt at trying to explain what author came across as he moved through ups and downs of his life and realized that life was in essence much more than science could explain and has made a successful attempt at expressing these experiences convincingly based on his profound scienific findings. At places there is excess criticism avoiding which can make the book even more appealing. Some of the statements especially on spiritual side also require stronger examples and more convincing.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|i loved the movie. i felt that the Bond series was a joke before this movie.  I know that kitsch was written into the scrupts on purpose and most of the bond movies are from a different era but i couldn't consider them action movies. Casino Royale feels like an action movie. My only problem is that there wasn't a digital copy. i guess i assumed that the : Cillectors Edition\\" wold contain one. Kind of a gyp but Ik guess thats my fault.

0439023483|5.0|Warning: this book is highly addictive. I could not put it down. You'll read it through in one sitting. Well written book, you'll get really attached to the characters you love, and hate the bad guys. One of my favorite books, I recommend it to everyone I know; that being said, it's not for the weak stomached..this book DOES have mature situations, dealing with death, fight for survival, and violent murder..etc. I wouldn't give it to a really young person. The whole premise of the story is set in a country that forces two kids from every district to kill each other every year, while the whole country watches. It's a sick thing that is glorified by the rich and powerful and government; there are the majority of the everyman that see it for what it is, and hate it. So, there is really no dispute in the book, as to whether its right or wrong. Which is good, but still theres need for discretion.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|I haven't been \\"into\\" films for too long now, just a couple of years.  But ever since I started watching Scorsese films they have been my favorite.  If I had to pick a film that I though was better than Goodfellas the only thing I would be able to say is The Aviator, another Scorsese picture.  I can't possible tell you what this film does while I'm watching it.  You get so drawn into the world you feel like you are know more about gangs than anyone.  It's such a fun movie with great replay value, especially in blu-ray.  The picture looks awesome (for a 1990 film) and it adds so much to the movie.  Highly Recommended!
B000NA2BEU|4.0|I thought the 1st and 2nd season of Veronica Mars were amazing. The third season was good, but there were some things I did not like, especially being a Logan/Veronica fan. The mysteries seemed less personal for the most part, unlike the first two seasons, (with Lilys murder, Logans parents, Duncan, etc.) The cast has new characters, some of which I like, some I didn't. But all in all, its still Veronica Mars, and I love the show. Dvds have some good extras on it, and an interesting \\"season 4 promo\\" that actually made me glad Veronica Mars was not picked up for season 4. :)

B0039OGGVQ|4.0|Slash is no stranger to collaboration. He has recorded with the likes of Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, and a host of other bands and artists over the years. His work with Guns N' Roses is legendary, his work with Velvet Revolver was notable and his side project, Slash's Snakepit, did a great job of showing off his skills. With a few signature Gibson guitars and a trademark look, complete with top hat and sunglasses, there is no question Slash is one of the most recognized and widely respected guitarists ever. With this in mind, it is no surprise Slash has finally decided to release a solo album highlighting his abilities.<br /><br />Slash is a guitarist. He plays the guitar incredibly well and really doesn't do much else. This holds true for his solo record. Those hoping to hear what Slash's vocals might sound like will be disappointed to learn he doesn't sing a note on his own solo record, instead offering the honor to a different vocalist on every track in the same way Santana did with Supernatural. Unlike Santana, however, Slash concentrated on his original core of fans when choosing names to collaborate with. Jack White may have turned him down, but that doesn't mean the cast of Slash isn't impressive. Ozzy Osbourne, Fergie, Chris Cornell, Andrew Stockdale, Dave Grohl, Kid Rock, and Iggy Pop are just a few of the artists that share a track with Slash on the guitar.<br /><br />Intricate guitar work is the forefront from the very beginning. Ian Astbury of the Cult takes the vocals on the first song; a track with a rather repetitive, yet impressive guitar backdrop aided by the presence of rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin. This seems to set the tone for a record with variety in vocals, but not necessarily in songwriting. Although Slash shares the songwriting credit on every song except \\"Watch This,\\" many of the songs fall into predictable patterns. Fergie changes the momentum a bit with her catchy \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" vocals. The real shining moment, however, is \\"Watch This,\\" an instrumental written entirely by Slash that features Dave Grohl and Duff McKagan. The track resembles many of Jeff Beck's instrumentals in that it frequently changes mood and tempo while always giving Slash the opportunity to really shine. In today's single-heavy society, it is unlikely most people will hear the only track without vocals on Slash, but if you want a true taste of his abilities, it's the track to hear.<br /><br />Although Slash uses the term \\"solo album\\" very loosely, the concept works for him. Slash's signature tone is ever present, but the changing voices keep things fresh. Although the songwriting often leaves something to be desired, the album as a whole remains solid without getting boring despite its fourteen track length. His most dedicated fans will be delighted, but Slash is worthy of a listen for anyone craving some classic guitar driven rock.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Guns N' Roses, Jeff Beck<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Watch This\\"g moment, however, is \\"Watch This,\\" an instrumental written entirely by Slash that features Dave Grohl and Duff McKagan.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|This show is a good example of how to simplify a very complex and rich series of books. Terry Goodkinds books while wonderful are to detailed to bring to the screen in its entirety. I feel that filming in New Zealand brings a feeling of \\"reality\\" and some of the genius casting of local professional actors brings a depth of skill americans will find a treat. The only thing I found as a dissapointment was the lack of Special Features. I would love to see more about how the sets, props and costumes are created.
0316017922|4.0|A fascinating read.  Gladwell dives into the concept of success - what makes some people successful, while others seem to lack the intelligence or ambition to take great strides in life?  Gladwell's research and theory reveal that much more goes into the recipe for success than one or two ingredients - in fact, according to Gladwell, it is many times something or a combination of things that are seemingly insignificant or even not known at the time that propel some forward.  For instance, the year a person was born had a huge significance on those who were able to take advantage of the personal computer revolution - Bill Gates at Microsoft is just one example of a young man born at the right time.  But there were still other factors beyond Gates' birthday, his intelligence, and his determination that helped shape him into one of the nation's preeminent software developers.  The stories are compelling and the concept underlying it all is that more of these \\"advantages\\" could be and should be available to more and more people and the result is that more and more people would be more \\"successful.\\"  The book makes for an interesting read; the suggestion makes for an interesting discussion that will hopefully result in those additional opportunities.  I did find it very interesting that in the telling of Gladwell's own success story, the element of faith/religion was mentioned.  I thought that religion was notably absent in the rest of the book, but as Gladwell's mother processed discrimination in light of her faith, she made decisions that ultimately affected Malcolm and his journey as much as the riots in Jamaica and the loan from the china shopkeeper.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|It's a shame that the producers chose Oprah.  Her narraration of this series makes it seem like she is talking down to you.  I enjoyed Sigourney Weaver in Planet Earth, but Oprah makes this unwatchable.  I stopped DVR'ing these and decided to wait for the BBC version with David Attenborough because he is the master of narration.      Save your money, the version with Oprah gives these DVD's NO replay value.
B002MRROKI|5.0|I should start out this review by saying that I am a huge Nirvana fan. I own pretty much every recording they have ever released and I actually was unaware that this live set was released on CD until well after it came out. They play some of their best songs at this show, and the power and force of Nirvana is felt when it comes out of the speakers. This live set shows how good music was 20 years ago and how most current music folds like a cheap suit in comparision. This album might be the best representative of what Kurt Cobain, Krist Noveselic, and Dave Grohl were all about when they picked up their instruments and played such an awesome show that it left the fans salivating for more.

B002ZG9788|3.0|Perseus (Sam Worthington) picked up from the sea by a fisherman, has no idea where he came from or where he is going.

He has many assistants as Io (Gemma Arterton) and many adventures in the process. Three witches keep an eye on him. Someone may lose his or her head and there is more than one bad person. Will Perseus take Hades (Ralph Fiennes) down a peg or is Perseus doomed. In any event, he must get Kraken.<br /><br />This presentation shows that CGI and 3D do not a film make. It helps to have dialog, pacing and a little better knowledge of antiquity.  As far as CGI is considered, some things can look scary and others like cartoons. This film falls somewhere in the middle but not as bad as it could have been. They only used what was needed to tell their story in today's action packed terms. I saw this movie in the theater for the 3D experience. I wanted to see if it was an improvement over the red and green or red and blue glasses.<br />So far, I will hold judgment. Some 3D can be eye popping and make you duck as it is coming at you. In the case of this movie, it was more like looking through a stereoscope or View Master. The third dimension was behind the front plate. Combining the CGI fast action with the 3D technology created a hairy mess and you had to wait until it was over to guess what happened. In any event, I now have a new set of glasses to add to my collection.<br /><br />I am slightly prejudice because I saw the original Clash and know what the movie could have been. However, it was not as bad as it could have been and has all the earmarks of a Hallmark special. The original film took a few liberties with the story but this version was out of the ballpark. See it once to help appreciate the original.

B0036B8MZU|5.0|Spartacus: Blood and Sand starts off a bit stupid in the first episode, but once you pass that one you will be in for a huge surprise,the show itself gets way better with each episode,Betrayed by the Romans. Forced into slavery. Reborn as a Gladiator,is this simple storyline of Spartacus,but also retold greatly,as well as other characters such as Lucy Lawless (Xena The Warrior Princess)proves she a great actor as you'll see a side of Lucy you never saw before as well as sexy and hot she really is.John Hannah does also superb as Batiatus and won't bore you for a moment,Then comes Spartacus play by Andy Whitfield who at first seems dull but quickly becomes also great to watch as he adapts to his new settings as Spartacus.Other reviewers probably spoil the show for you so I'll keep my story plot of the show simple,a Thracian is Betrayed by the Romans,so feeling angry for what happen to him, he leads a mutiny against Glaber the one who betrayed him. But once he returns home he finds his village has been destroy and is captured by Glaber and his wife who is sentenced to slavery while he is sentence to death ,that's all I will tell you, but there is so much storytelling to be told during this crazy show fill with Sex,Nudity as well as intense blood & gore and cussing.THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR KIDS.You will be very addicted to this that you'll probably go through you'll dvds in 1 day,also there are 13 episodes in this season so enjoy watching just like I enjoy Lucy in the nude.LOL

B00337KM2S|4.0|This movie is delightfully written and easy to follow !  The plot is one that many who travel for a living can relate to! I am retired from that rat race BUT enjoyed the perks of being a frequent flyer as well as a frequent hotel lodger!!  The length of the movie was just right. Perfect ending and I would love to see this frequent traveller get into other situetions!!  Great opportunity for a sequel!!
B001HN694K|4.0|I didn't feel a compulsion to see this film. I like Johnny Depp but don't have the need to see whatever role he's taken on.<br /><br />But a friend wanted to go and I tagged along.<br /><br />Here are a few things that surprised me.<br /><br />I liked it. Didn't love it but liked it enough that I can suggest that those who love good vs. evil, mythical war scenes and mild to moderate adventure to give it a shot.<br /><br />Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter is a skillfully played and entertaining if sadly whimsical character but he is not the main player. The point of view is primarily Alice. The Hatter doesn't appear until about a half hour or so into the film and then comes and goes after that. His film time ends up being maybe half of the film. The Red Queen is a slightly bigger (pun intended) player in the whole storyline. The well done and creepily compelling characterization by Helena Bonham Carter may never, never leave my psyche.<br /><br />The plot line is a parallel story to the traditional Alice adventure. Some of the plot is familiar like the shrinking and growing Alice, tea parties and beheadings. What's not familiar is an interesting addition to a more grown-up version. The first 15-20 minutes is very low key in the adventure department so don't expect to find yourself plunging immediately into a rabbit hole.<br /><br />I don't know that I'd recommend this film for very sensitive children. Tim Burton and Depp fans may or may not love it. I'd watch it again and probably will but I probably won't own it for regular viewing.
0792837614|4.0|The product was in wonderful condition.  I was a little disappointed with the long delivery time.  I ordered three videos from three different vendors, and the other two arrived 7-10 days before this one.  It came just before the end of the promised dates.
0385523386|5.0|I was skeptical about this book at first (Why does the white girl with the literary hipster friends emerge from prison with a publicity blitz and a book deal, yada yada) but the author's thoughtful and nuanced interview on [...] won me over.  So glad I got over my judgemental self and gave this book a chance.  Orange is the New Black is funny, surprising, haunting, compassionate, filled with unforgettable characters, and most of all, beautifully written.  The author's journey through the prison system is, of course, completely fascinating, but her emotional journey is what makes the book impossible to put down.  Perhaps most importantly, she never forgets to place own story in a broader context. As terrible as her experiences in prison were, many of her fellow inmates--who do not share her education, relative wealth, or social status--faced much more daunting prospects in life, in court, in prison, and after their release. Our common understanding of what women experience in prison is influenced more by Roger Corman films than by reality.  There are many women in prison whose voices need to be heard, and Ms. Kerman does an excellent job of articulating the reasons why we should be listening.

B0030BOCEG|4.0|I am a huge HIM fan I have everything they have ever done including their first recording. I mean this one grows on you after repeat listenings but overall I don't think it has the standing replay magic that Razorblade Romance or Love Metal had. My favorite track is \\"Dying Song.\\" I feels like a blending of Razorblade Romance and Dark light's sound. The second disc is an entirely acoustic version of the first one. Basically I like this album but was having higher expectations for what I was about to hear. I'm still going to recommend it though if you're a constant fan because it shows the progression of their sound in an interesting way. More guitars coming through as the keyboards take step back into the soundscape of the track. As always the lyrics are melancholy and fetching to the listener.

B0014NHJK6|5.0|'We humans have two great problems: the first is knowing when to begin,<br />the second is knowing when to stop.'<br />  Paulo Coelho, The Zahir<br /><br />Paulo Coelho's [[ASIN:B002H398M4 The Alchemist - Gift Edition (Hardcover)]] is one of my favourite books. Every few years I pick it up again to reread. It's a classic fable--poetic and meaningful. A beautiful story about the value and magic inherent in following our dreams.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0014NHJK6 The Zahir (A Novel of Obsession)]] is completely different. It seems semi-autobiographical like many of Coelho's other books. In fact, the author states in The Zahir that any writer can only write about themselves. I extrapolate this to mean we can only deeply share that which we've personally experienced.<br /><br />I love the book. I personally enjoy Coelho's openness about life as a best-selling author. And I've received much insight from his comments about expressing and releasing the past. Here are a couple of excerpts from The Zahir on that subject:<br /><br />'\\"How does one go about abandoning the story one was told?\\"<br />\\"By repeating it out loud in meticulous detail. And as we tell our story, we say goodbye to what we were and, as you'll see if you try, we create space for a new, unseen world...\\"'<br /><br />'\\"When I had nothing more to lose, I was given everything. When I ceased to be who I am, I found myself. When I experienced humiliation and yet kept on walking, I understood that I was free to choose my destiny...\\"'<br /><br />Like Coelho, I believe in the value of sharing our stories. I also fully resonate with his words and feelings about the guidance we receive constantly if we allow it. The following words from the book beautifully summarize Coelho's perspective regarding what I call synchronicity, what he calls signs:<br /><br />'I believe in signs. After I had walked the road to Santiago, everything had changed completely: what we need to learn is always there before us, we just have to look around us with respect and attention in order to discover where God is leading us and which step we should take next. I also learned a respect for mystery: as Einstein said, God does not play dice with the Universe, everything is interconnected and has a meaning. That meaning may remain hidden nearly all the time, but we always know we are close to our true mission on earth when what we are doing is touched with the energy of enthusiasm.'<br /><br />The Zahir is set in Paris and in the steppes of central Asia. I recommend the book for anyone interested in the modern human condition and for anyone interested in the art of relating to the one(s) you love. After The Alchemist, this is my favourite Paulo Coelho offering. Read it. Once begun, you won't want to put it down.<br /><br />Radio host, inspirational speaker and health educator John Haines is the author of [[ASIN:1439207313 In Search of Simplicity: A True Story that Changes Lives]], a startlingly poignant and inspiring real-life endorsement of the power of thought, belief and synchronicity in one's life.with respect and attention in order to discover where God is leading us and which step we should take next.

B00337KM2S|4.0|I like Clooney and I also like Vera Farmiga (The Departed.) This movie was enjoyable though it does not have much excitement. It gives you a real good look at how impersonal the world we live in is becoming. The plot was fairly intersting as Clooney discovers he wants to put down roots again and tries to build real connections with people. He succeeds in some areas and fails in others. A good movie to watch on a slow Sunday evening.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|After a career that has spanned about 40 years, the Scorpions are saying farewell with one last album, Sting In The Tail. The Scorpions are certainly a band that sounds like that of the yesteryear, and of a bygone era, but yet somehow at the same time, they can sound pretty modern and the furthest thing from out dated. That was especially the case in 2007's Humanity Hour I (previously reviewed here on Ethos), which was a modern classic, amplified with a modern sound. Sting In The Tail still sounds quite relevant, but is a step backwards from its predecessor album. What this album does accomplish is a harkening back to their 80s heyday, while striking that modern balance.<br /><br />  The opening track, \\"Raised On Rock\\", also the album's single, is absolutely one of the Scorpions best songs I've ever heard. It has a boisterious energy that hopefully will amp up its chances of making a splash on the radio or iTunes. It's a terrific, rousing, rock stomp with that awesome signature double-guitar attack. It's got a catchy melody, and a cool bravado.<br /><br />  Sting In The Tail is certainly a valiant effort. It's not a perfect album, but it definitely provides a fitting farewell to its fans. It salutes them with a one-two punch of what they do best - engage you in their ballads, and energize you with their heavy rockers. After all these years, the band itself still sounds so professional and tight. Klaus Meine, the lead singer, is 62 years old and his voice sounds as crisp, clear, and as powerful as ever - it is remarkable. So with that all being said, I recommend Sting In The Tail. The Scorpions have had a long, illustrious, and successful career, and I hope they all enjoy their final tour together, as they bow out here with grace. Goodbye Scorpions, we the fans, thank you for all the wonderful years.<br /><br />READ THE FULL WRITTEN REVIEW ON MY WEBSITE!! Go to my profile and click on my website.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I purchased Castle the dvd on the first 6 shows. This is my favorite tv show and I loved the dvd. Plan to get the next season when it comes out. The chemistry between the two main characters is awsome. Thanks Amazon for and entertaining dvd!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I got this movie for my daughter, originally thinking it would be a cookie cutter film.  It turned out to be a great movie with an interesting plot and characters you become emotional connected to.  It also shows the importance of hard work and dedication in pursuing your goals while pointing out you should not loose site of what is importance or take unethical paths to quickly reach your dreams.  It is nice to have a Disney movie that really captures American Values.
1401323820|5.0|I got the book by Richard Castle, titled Heat Wave, which is penned by the character Richard Castle in the tv series of the same name. He is a murder mystery writer who uses a cop named Kate Becket as his new herion in his books. So he gets to tag along with her on different murder investigations as he writes her into his books. Their chemistry is awsome which make the show my favorite. The book is written for the show and is referenced a few times in the show. So had to read it to be more informed. Really gets the viewing audience involved. Really enjoyed the read, thanks Amazon!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I could watch this series once a week & still roar with laughter every time! It never ages & is brilliantly done.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Not only is this a super cool CD but the seller sent it to me in mint condition. I'm extremely pleased and would purchase from this seller again in a heartbeat!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I got my iPad on Saturday and began looking for the ESV Study bible.  I saw an epub version being offered at Cross Publishers for $14.95 and decided to download it.    I installed it on my iPad and had problems with crashes.  Contacted Cross and they provided a new link to an updated version.  I downloaded it and could now read the whole study bible but if I was to click on a reference I would be brought to the reference on another page with no way to return to the start page unless I would write down the number of the page and then use the scroll bar at the bottom of the page to get back to the vicinity of the starting page and then click on the right or left side of the page to finally get back to where I was before I hit the reference.   This is not my idea of workable software and is probably why it's not available on the iTunes site yet.  I'm sure that this problem will eventually be fixed but I thought I'd warn anyone who might be wondering whether to download directly from the publisher or whether it might make sense to download the new Kindle iPad application from Amazon and then download the Kindle edition of the ESV for $9.95.    The Kindle is the way to go.  I loaded it onto my iPad and it WORKS GREAT.  The ESV Study Bible works incredibly quickly and well on my iPad using the Kindle application.  When I click on any link in the bible it goes immediately to that page, to return I merely tap once on the lower part of the reader which brings up the various tools in a neat line across the bottom of the page.  One tap on the left pointing arrow goes immediately to where I was before I tapped the link.         This is the way to go.    Thanks Amazon
B000001GPX|5.0|I was skeptical that this recording would be significantly better than the existing one I had (Bruno Walter, which is pretty good!), but wow. There is a lot of energy in this recording. I found myself stopping my work and just listening to it.
B0002BO05S|1.0|Amazon should refund my money - this movie is NOT GOOD!  After watching the first 45 minutes of the movie we decided to fast forward the movie to 'what had to be the good parts' - there were none.
1440471045|5.0|This is one of the best books that I've even read.<br />It was the inspiration behind my Pup Fiction tale<br />for young readers, THE STORY OF SIDDARFFA.<br />Read it at [..]<br />LaMonte Heflick, Elkhart Community Schools
0345423496|4.0|I find myself really surprised by the number of negative comments \\"3001\\" has received here, and I think some of those comments have been made without proper context and knowledge.<br /><br />Regarding the discontinuities between this book and its predecessors: Clarke always said the four books take place in slightly different realities. Thus, Poole's birthdate of 1996 here is fine, NOT idiotic or careless as some people have suggested. The author was publishing \\"3001\\" in 1997, and because it was very clear \\"2001\\" wasn't going to HAPPEN by 2001, he moved everything back a few decades. BIG DEAL. Get over it and roll with it -- it's science fiction anyway!<br /><br />Regarding the Monoliths being somehow diminished as the author treats them more as supercomputers and less as mystical objects: Again, what's the problem? Clarke wrote each of these books to explore certain themes; though connected, each volume stands on its own.<br /><br />Finally, regarding the absence here of Heywood Floyd and the apparently major discrepancy between this book and \\"2061\\": Again, get over it! Perhaps Heywood Floyd somehow separated himself from Dave and HAL during the centuries, or the Monolith did it somehow for some reason. Who knows? Who CARES?! I never thought having Floyd fuse with Dave and Hal in \\"2061\\" was such a hot idea anyhow.<br /><br />I do agree with some reviewers here that the ending seems a bit rushed. And overall, the tone of the book is less ... hmm ... majestic than the earlier ones. But it's anything but \\"sarcastic,\\" as one reviewer said, and I don't find it at all sour, either, as others have suggested. The feeling of the book is vintage Clarke: Open, curious, wide-eyed with a sense of wonder at the marvels that may exist in the Universe. \\"3001\\" is a terrific read.
1581806574|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter to expand on her current skill level. It has given her many new ideas, & techniques to draw things she has struggled w/ in the past. Worth the investment.
0375842209|1.0|I don't get it. Other reviewers who dared not love this book have been bombarded with outrageous haters. I could not get into this book at all. For one thing, the bold script notes were distracting. The German phrases in several instances were not really translated colloquially. I realize that they may have meant about the same thing, but I found it distracting. Basically, I just did not love this book. I just don't think the author is as clever as he believes himself to be.  If anyone cares to berate my ignorance, be forewarned that I will not care one little bit. I will still have hated this book.
0446569895|5.0|This is one of the best books I ever read.  Pleasantly surprising!  Super interesting! And soooo funny! I've read THOUSANDS of books, and this one is in the top ten.  I didn't want to put it down.  Absolutely fascinating.  Trust me.  You'll love it.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|Simply the best Scorpions album since Face the Heat 1993      \\"Raised On Rock\\": A great catchy rock song and a great opener of this album.      \\"Sting In The Tail\\": The title song of the album. Another great rock anthem.      \\"Slave Me\\": This song is slightly heavier that the two previous.      \\"The Good Die Young\\": Here Klaus used throughout the song his dark voice which will give you shivers. Also Scorpions here at this teamed up with Tarja (ex-Nightwish), and she is delivering amazing background vocals.     \\"No Limit\\": This one is the heaviest song of the album. This one will make you head-bang and it is the best song to get a speeding ticket.      \\"Rock Zone\\" and \\"Spirit of Rock\\": Well the titles are doing the talking here. We are taking about rock songs that got raised from the 80's and they both sound fresh as well.     \\"Lorelei\\": The first ballad of the album. It features the mixture of classic and electric guitars.  This one has the typical Scorpions love lyrics.      \\"Turn You On\\": Back to the rock anthems, get ready for some air guitar again. This song will make you grab the album \\"Blackout\\" and it after this song is done. .     \\"Sly\\": The second ballad of the album. This one is very close to the \\"Still Loving You\\" song.    \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\":  This will become their new ballad anthem when they perform live.
B000E8NQUE|5.0|Played on Samsung blu-ray player sent to Sony 5.1 via optical cord.  I played the 1997 CD and compared to this SACD. I had always felt that the CD was a little inadequate and the SACD brings it home.  \\"In the beginning\\", ('I think, I think I am.') This has got to be the coolest opening cut ever. (Even cooler than the \\"cough, cough, cough\\" of Sweet Leaf\\".)  Then it's \\"Lovely to See You Again\\"  We get to enjoy a rock feel-good cut. (Damn, if they had these kind of graphics when I was doing acid, I NEVER would have quit!)  Everything moves nicely through \\"Dear Diary\\" (\\"Somebody exploded an H bomb today, but it wasn't anybody I knew.\\"), \\"Send Me No Wine\\" (\\"If only everybody found the answer in LOVE.\\"), to \\"To Share Our Love\\", \\"So Deep Within You\\", \\"Never Comes the Day\\" has probably the greatest rock-and-roll line ever 'If only you knew whats inside of me now, You wouldn't want to know me some how...', and \\"Lazy Day\\" (A lament on Mothers having to work on Sundays.)   Okay, we're riding high and in the old days it was called peaking.  \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\" sets you up for...  \\"The Dream\\" opens the peak.  \\"Have You Heard\\" opens the door.  \\"The Voyage\\" is the trip.  Back to \\"Have You Heard\\", but with a new point of view.  In exhaustion from the trip you now collapse.    Okay, if you are considering this 'upgrade' of this CD, DO IT!   For those of you into 'insights and different versions there are nine bonus tracks. In this order they are; \\"In the Beginning\\" (full version), \\"So Deep Within You\\" (extended version), \\"Dear Diary\\" (alternate vocal mix), \\"Have You Heard\\" (original take), \\"The Voyage\\" (original take), \\"Lovely to See You\\" (variation), \\"Send Me No Wine\\" (variation), \\"So Deep Within You\\" (variation), \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably\\" (variation).    There's a booklet that comes with the album. It tells the story of the beginning of the modern 'Moodies' and the album. It also contains pictures that bring back some days and the lyrics to all the cuts as did the original album.  This is just awesome! This is the Moodies at their peak!  Personal story-In 1970 I was in Vietnam. I was sometimes a truck driver. One day early in my tour I delivered supplies to a fire base. I was by myself and walking around the base when I heard \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" coming from one of the barracks. I went over and knocked on the door and asked to be able to come in and listen with him. That day I made a new friend!    The original CD has some 'pops' where there should be a sound. This SACD is awesome (did I say that before?)! This is a SACD so you need to be sure that you can play it on your system.  Peace
B001F290E4|3.0|This man has an incredibly rich soulful voice, and I admire him as a person (from what I see).  I read the list of the classics on this CD, and I was so excited to add this to my collection.  I just got it and listened for the first time.  I wanted to fall in love with this CD, I really, really did.  Instead I am disappointed, and irritated with David Foster for slickly ruining the seeds of soul.  The arrangements are in some cases, just downright cheesy.  Other times I can picture Broadway dancers doing jazz hands.  I wanted to sit with Seal on a couch in front of a roaring fire and have him lay his heart and soul in my hands.  Now, I will listen to this CD again, and probably will start to like some of the songs...but now I am warned (and so are you)...don't expect to lose your heart to this Soul.
B000E8NQU4|4.0|Compared this version and the 1997 CD on Samsung blu-ray player connected to a Sony 5.1 via optical cord. I'm listening to the CD on my computer using Windows Media player.    First and most important is that you realize that this isn't an SACD. This is a regular CD. That said, it is still much better than the 1997 remaster.  There are two CDs, The original album remastered and alternate versions of songs on the CD plus \\"What Am I Doing Here?', \\"Visions of Paradise\\", and \\"a Simple Game\\" (two versions).  If for some very strange reason you are reading this and are not familiar with 'the Moodies' I can only say that this is a Masterpiece! The Moody Blues created the 'Magnificent Seven'.   Unsatisfied with their early success as a kind of cover band, Decca gave them the opportunity to create a whole new genre and they did it!    For those of you not familiar with this acid trip, you are in for a treat!  First we depart and immediately get the idea of the insanity to ensue!  Up we go and then we \\"Ride My See-saw\\" and learn some answers are no longer true.  On to the undiscovered when we meet 'Dr. Livingston, I Presume\\". Have I mentioned that this is an awesome album?! 'We're all looking for someone.' x  My god, they have some great graphics in Media Player!  \\"House of Four Doors\\" begins the true journey. (Back in 1970 when I was introduced to the hippie culture, this was one of the albums along with \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\" to which I was to listen while taking my first acid trip. I spent several days trying to find the phrase I heard, \\"This trip has been brought to you by the Moody Blues.\\"   The 'House of Four Doors', 'Legend of the Mind' is the most awesome trip next to \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\".     We begin with the \\"Departure\\" although brief.  On to \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" with it's up and down action.  Then we are all searching for someone in \\"Dr. Livingston, I Presume.\\"  \\"House of Four Doors\\" is the beginning of the peak. We come to four doors and at the fourth door we take off.   \\"Legend of the Mind\\" is the peak trip! Is Timothy Leary really dead?!? 'He will bring you back the same day.'  Back to the 'House of Four Doors'   Personal note-I never understood the four doors concept. The problem was when I was in 'nam I was a Christian in my heart. It wasn't until later that I realized Buddhism really fit my beliefs the best. Then I understood the house of four doors; physical, ethereal, mental, spiritual.  Alright, I had a chat with some god while tripping and listening to this album. You don't understand or hopefully you really do understand 'The Magnificent Seven' by the 'Moodies'  Peace

0385523386|1.0|I am completely bewildered at the copious stars bestowed upon this essentially shallow memoir. While the rest of us scrimped and saved for early-twenties adventure, our author was way too grand for actual work, attaching herself to her drug running lesbian lover for a life of freebies and 5-star travel.  I find it impossible to believe that she was the hapless innocent drug runner that she portrays.  Impossible by her own standards, for we are told repeatedly that she is a graduate of Smith, Fast forward, a decade and she finds herself no longer the long-practicing lesbian that she  once was -  but deeply, passionately, breathlessly teenage in love with Larry.<br /><br />When her past catches up with her, this is where it all turns into a mystery.  It appears that her life is only populated with adoring and supporting fans, including unbelievably, Larry's parents.  EVERYONE is understanding and loving. She seems devoid of any shame or embarrassment. She never considers that all the support that she is getting isn't radical chic.  It's the first thing I suspected.  The crushing cost of a top-notch criminal defense lawyer as her case grinds on for a few years apparently doesn't put a crimp on the yuppie New York lifestyle, for it appears that her and Larry have that ever-vague, yet lucrative Manhattan publishing job.  Well, she did graduate from Smith.  Her time is the clink in one of tedium and menial labor and, of course loads of reading Smith-worthy books - A little R&R on the government dime.  Hardly the gulag.  Her boyfriend Larry is cartoonish in his devotion.  The reader is never privy to an honest transaction between them. He pparently didn't have an ounce of apprehension about her lesbian tendencies and what that would mean for her prison term or having a convicted felon as the mother of his children.  Of course her housing needs will be met on her release, for he bought them a pretty apartment in Brooklyn (no small financial feat) to reward her upon her release.  Our heroine never once agonizes over how being an ex-con will impact her future, particularly her future employment.  In essence this is a story of a spoiled entitled woman, whose story isn't the least bit insightful. Save your money!Our heroine never once agonizes over how being an ex-con will impact her future, particularly her future employment.

096798467X|5.0|Excellent book. Covers all the basic steps to building a clay oven, as well as presenting variations , other alternatives, and presenting a compelling case for hands on living.
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this album , but after I heard it all I was left with a need to listen to all my GnR cds again ! The only track I didn't like was \\"Gotten\\" feat. Adam Levine - sure Slash shreds the solo but this song has nothing to do with this album. And don't even get me started on the \\"Paradise City\\" cover...some songs you just don't change ! Anyway , it left me wanting more new songs by Slash , so I guess it's ok.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|We watched the Bee Gees - One Night Only on Netflix and liked it so well I decided to purchase it.  Not only is the music great but the video and audio quality of this DVD are very good.  We will listen to and watch this DVD many, many times in the future.
0451450523|5.0|This is the type of book you think, \\"What if I had never discovered this story?  I can't imagine my life without it.\\"  I read this novel over twenty years ago, and I can honestly say, I love it just as much today as I did the very first time I read it.  It's a fairytale for all ages, and if you want to fall in love, this is definitely your book.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|This was the worst movie I have seen in many years.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  The acting was like a bunch of 3rd graders who have never acted before.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Oprah's narration KILLS this series. It's awful. What made the first series so great is that it was beautifully shot, and it didn't have someone (Oprah) talking about it like her audience is in pre-school.    I have stopped watching the series, and will be purchasing the BBC version. I'm very disappointed.
0066621003|5.0|This is a wonderful book that has any business owner or organization ask itself the right questions. At first I wasn't sure if it applied to me, being that I have a very small business and assumed that maybe this book was written about and for major companies.<br /><br />While it does profile major companies to make its case, this book applies to any business owner anywhere - from a single-shingle contractor to an international conglomerate. It's had me ask myself the right questions, and has nudged me away from repeating the same mistakes, and towards identifying what I could really excell at and aiming to be the best I can possibly be in my area of expertise.<br /><br />Though it does aim ait big organizations, it's a perfect book to help anyone identify some basic principles of success, in business and in life.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is one of those rare occurrences, like when all the stars align, and everything works.    This series is just too damned clever.    Let's start with the premise. What was Andrew Marlowe thinking when he wrote the pilot? \\"I like procedurals, but I don't want to make another CSI.  I like comedy, but sitcoms really aren't my thing. I like smart, witty banter that doesn't play to the dumbest member of the audience. Oh, I've got it! And he's such an ass...Castle that everybody loves him.\\"    Enter Beckett. The chemistry between Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic's characters is palpable, not forced.  She hates him; she admires him; she's flattered by him; she hates him. The audience wants them to get together but knows they can't.     Watch Stana's reactions when she's not talking, that's something you can't teach folks.    In fact the whole cast works so well together that their ad libs make the writers look even better - And the writers cleverly continue to challenge Castle's characters and compel the viewer.    Great directing, outstanding art direction and wardrobe, well-placed music (remember \\"Everybody Loves Me\\" ?)    It's so nice to see producers and writers who actually believe their audience will not only get it, but will love it.    You will too.
B00005ASIL|5.0|I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Tull. Ian Anderson is, of course, a virtuoso flautist and his music has always gotten me, powerful, witty and full of poetic and rustic implications. He would have been perfect in 1810 Lake Country England, hoisting a few down with Byron, Shelley and Wordsworth or sending letters to a dying Keats in sunny Rome, where he in fact died! Ian's art is timeless and this collection captures that beautifully, highly recommend it!
030745455X|5.0|I was on a trip to Denmark where my brother and sister-in-law introduced me to these books.  I have read all three and can't wait to see the films.  We tried to find an English subtitled one while in Denmark to no avail.  I could hardly put the last one down.  I'm sorry that there won't be a fourth, fifth, etc.
B0019MQBJW|3.0|This is really a Rudolf made Swan Lake. Maybe it could be considered as a good performance in 1960s, but a different story after 2000. The leader dancers are less of skills, comparing to the Russian Dancers. Anyway, the video image is awesome and the group dancing is very good. Personally, I would recommend the Uliana Lopatkina release.

B002VECM4A|4.0|This movie is too real to say the least. First of all, being a female who was raised in low income neigborhoods in the South, I can relate to everything Precious went through. Hell! Most of the girls I graduated High School with were in the exact same situation, and that's if they even made it before dropping out completely. So, this isn't exactly all that brand new, or all that thought-provoking to me. I guess because I've personally seen this time and time again. With that said, it is a sad movie, so you better bring a box of kleenex with you. It's certainly not for everybody either. Clarisse \\"Precious\\" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) is a 16-year-old obese black female. Precious is obese because her abusive mother force feeds her on the regular, but we only get a glimpse into that. Plus, Precious has one child (whom she's not raising) and another one on the way. On top of that, she has no education and she can't read or write. Furthermore, both her kids are products of rape by her father, and one of them has down's syndrome because of that fact. Mary (Mo'Nique) is her abusive mother (A well-deserved supporting actress winner). Mary hates Precious because she feels like she slept with her man and got pregnant for him on purpose. Nevermind, the fact she allowed her man to rape his own child while she watched, but Mary still blames Precious at any rate. This is sickening to say the least. However, they don't stop there, Precious constantly day dreams through-out the movie, but the day dreams are used as a coping mechanism or an escape from the horrible reality that is her life. Precious is constantly torn down by her mother physically and verbally because she's on welfare and does nothing with her life besides sitting around watching television all day and collecting checks for Precious and her child which she's not raising either (the grandmother is). Parent's telling lies, and making their children tell lies only to collect checks is another fact I know about all too well. Clearly, Mary wants the same for Precious, so she continues to make her feel crappy about herself so she won't do any better than what she's doing. If that's not enough, Precious was even being molested by her own mother. A fact which I think a lot of people missed about the movie too. I guess because the abuse by her father was so front and center, and the sexual abuse by her mother was very subtle. You really have to pay attention, or you'll miss it, and Mo'Nique actually admits to it in the end when she admits to needing someone to touch her and make her feel good. I think most people only thought she meant that it was because Precious ran her man off. If that isn't enough, there's a scene where Mary is masturbating and she asks Precious to come take care of her. That was sick! If you missed that part, either watch the movie again, or look at the special features on the DVD with the Director's interviews. At any rate, back to the overall plot, Precious has a guidance counselor who cares enough to tell her about the \\"Each One Teach One\\" program in order for her to better herself. In the program she meets other girls who are just like her. Granted, their story may not be hers, but she realizes she's not alone, and for the first time she's able to maintain friendships with her teacher and peers. That's something she's never had before, and frankly, I think that's the only time you see her with a smile on her fact through-out the movie (when she's interacting with these people). Through this program Precious develops a healthy mother-figure relationship with Blue Rain, her teacher and mentor from the program. It's always nice to know there's at least one person in the world that cares enough about you to help. Paula Patton, plays this role perfectly right along with Mo'Nique and Gabourey. With that said, it's through this program that Precious gains an inner strength and inspiration that she never knew she had. Therefore, she's able to make her situation better bylearning to read and write, focus on being a better mother for her children, and facing all of her past demons, so she can close that chapter of her life and move on. Just when you see the glimmer of hope for her another bombshell is dropped. Precious' father has just died of HIV and she's HIV positive as well. HIV is another topic that seems taboo within the African American community, and that's made prevalent by her mother's ignorant response after being asked if she had contracted the virus as well. Again, this was another brave move. I'm glad this was addressed in the movie the way it was because there are far too many people that are scared to take a chance or even touch down on this topic. At any rate, Precious knows she still has to move on for her children if she ever hopes to be free of her mother completely. I guess one good thing that can be taken from this movie is that, no matter how bad your situation is you can always rise above it. With that said, I did expect more out of the ending, but overall, I liked this movie. It's the type of movie you have to be mentally prepared to watch because it is depressing.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages.  My young grandchildren just love it!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed!  Sandra Bullock never fails at invoking the emotional response she intends.  This movie provides so many moments of emotional stimulation it should be a crime.  EVERYONE in my family has seen this multiple times and will keep on viewing.  I love it when you find a movie that will deliver such delightful humor over and again.    REALLY WORTH THE PRICE and then some!
B0007GAERG|5.0|After unsuccessfully trying to get back in the good graces of her fanbase with 2002's Charmbracelet, Mariah Carey did the best thing: she took a break. Three years and a few smart collabos later, she discovered her inner Mimi and set her free. The first thing you'll notice about this album is how rested and re-energized her voice is. The whispery vocals of Glitter and Charmbracelet are no more. It's not quite as powerful as it was back in the Vision of Love days, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />The bumpin' clubber It's Like That finds Mariah enjoying a night out with her friends and leaving the drama at the door. The piano ballad and number one hit We Belong Together is just the tip of the slow jams iceberg on this record. All of the ballads are what you'd call \\"grown folks music\\", meaning they reflect on love and relationships in a mature manner. The old school Mine Again, \\"faux live\\" Diana Ross-like glam of I Wish You Knew, and piano heavy Circles are highlights for the grown and sexy. Mariah sings the hell out of all of them!<br /><br />If you're looking for some other clubbers, look no further than the Nelly assisted midtempo jam To The Floor, 80s throwback romp Get Your Number, and the funked up Snoop Dogg duet Say Somethin' (my personal fave). The sassy kiss off Shake It Off and the starry eyed glitter of Joy Ride are excellent as well.<br /><br />Mariah's real life pastor the late Clarence Keaton reading some scripture opens the gospel track Fly Like A Bird. A choir joins Mariah in crying out for the Lord to heal the ills of the world and \\"carry me higher!\\" Perfect ender. Although Mariah's latest album Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel isn't selling so well, don't call her out just yet. She always finds a way to get back out on top.
B000Z6RH32|5.0|Black Rain is one of the best movies Michael Douglas has ever made, full of action and intrigue in the dangerous streets of Osaka, Japan. It will keep you on the edge of your seat! Andy Garcia is always good.  Fatal Attraction is the second movie in this set (2 separate DVD's)and it's a classic now. Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are electrifying together! This movie shows it doesn't pay to fool around on your spouse! Not sure if this is the version where she boils the rabbit because I have not watched it yet.  Both are worth the price of one DVD so this is a real bargain!
0385737424|4.0|As an adult, I love this book. I found the story interesting, the writing clean and evocative, and the characters believable. I would love to give this to my 6th grade son, but I am not sure he would like it. This is a quiet book about ideas and relationships, not primarily an adventure, though it is the mystery that pulls the story forward, the book is not about the mystery. I love that, he probably wouldn't.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is the bleakest, darkest show on TV.  It would be unbearable if not for the excellent cast, led by the superb Bryan Cranston, the unpredictable plots, and the great dialogue.  The situation remains dire:  Walt still has cancer, coughs a lot--sometimes blood, still cooks the best dope in all of Albuquerque with his goofy partner/distributor, and is getting caught up in the world of drug sales and criminals.  In the meantime, his brother in law, a DEA agent, is brewing beer in his garage when not investigating drug-related crimes.  And Walt's wife and son still have no clue about what he is doing, although he remains a mystery because he's so often gone from the house for long stretches of time.  Walt becomes much more of a hardball this time around, since one has to be made of strong stuff in order to hold one's own in the world of illicit drugs.    It can be hard to watch, yet you cannot look away.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I have seen the first 2 episodes of The Pacific and am truly in awe of the production.  It is so well done, so authentic and, quite frankly, a bit scary.  Scary to think what these people went through - this was the price that was paid for our freedom as Americans.  Besides being informative and educational, this mini series inspires a great sense of pride in being American and a great appreciation for what we have in the 21st century.  I would recommend it without hesitation, however, it is not, in my opinion, suitable for children under the age of 18.
0380715430|3.0|but I didn't know until I actually read some of the other reviews. I'll just deal with the mistakes that he made when he talked about Chinese/ Japanese:<br /><br />1. Chinese words have more endings than just -n/-ng. There are many others;<br />2. There is no such thing as \\"Guoyo.\\" The word is \\"GuoyU\\" (=national language).<br />3. There are no 7,000 Kanji in common use in Japan. There are 1948 Kanji listed in the Toyo Kanji.<br />4. There are more than 48 Katakana. I believe that there are either 52 or 56, but DEFINITELY more than 48.<br />5. NO, NO, NO, the writing of 2,500 years ago in China is not the same as the writing of today. Characters have been simplified (#1) and meanings tend to change over time (#2)<br />6. For some of the other languages (Cantonese and Hokkien), special characters had to be invented for those languages because Mandarin does not map 1:1 onto Cantonese or Hokkien (or any other others, for that matter), so some of the same grammatical structures didn't quite work.<br />7. Contrary to the figure of \\"215\\" words corresponding to \\"yi\\" I count 51 irreducible words that correspond to \\"yi\\" over the 4 tones in my Chinese dictionary. So, new words are made by adding extant words together. Two extant words makes one new word, but that does not make the first part of the irreducible word \\"yi\\" different each time.<br />8. No, there are not only 2,000 languages on the planet. There are something like 800 just in Papua New Guinea. I never knew that there were 1,200 or 1,600 in India, but even that number sounds suspect. If each state has one language, then that is less than 50 languages.<br />9. No, there is no such thing as a \\"Peking dialect.\\" The language is called \\"Mandarin\\" in English and it is the \\"guanhua\\" (=official language). Without getting into the semantics of the done-to-death \\"Chinese= language or dialect?\\" debate, suffice it to say that there are at least 8 separate and mutually intelligible languages here.<br />10. Ha Ha Ha. There are supposed to be more English speakers in China than in the United States. I have heard that lie for the millionth time this week. And this book was written something like 20 years ago-- and that level still has not been achieved. Can one really be expected to believe that 1 person out of 4 in China speaks English-- or ever has (or ever will)?<br /><br />The author did not make that much mention of Chinese and there were just loads of factual errors even in the things that he said. And so I wonder how many other things that he said (and of which I have no experience) are also just flatly wrong?<br /><br />Yes, there are not that many people who speak English in lots of given places (chapter on \\"English as a World Language\\"), but the ones that do make it out do use English to communicate with each other.<br /><br />This book has a lot of neat (if suspect) factoids, but one comes away with the distinct impression that this was just a really smart guy who has made a lot of observations stretching them too far to fill up a book.than in the United States.

0061849901|5.0|In college I took a literature course in American literature and my teacher chose the theme of \\"madness\\" for the course. The syllabus called for a few of Ralph Ellison's works, Toni Morrison's, and Sylvia Plath's. Sadly, since the course was only ten weeks, Sylvia Plath's \\"The Bell Jar\\" was not discussed in the class. I didn't bother to read the book until out of college.    After reading reviews online, I decided that I needed to take the time to read it. Plath starts the story off really slow with Esther Greenwood explaining her internship over the summer. For the first fifty pages I had no idea why it was deemed a classic. However, though slow, I still had a desire to read what happened to Ms. Greenwood.  The more that I read of the book, the harder is was to put down. If she would have shown the same symptoms today, I do not believe that she would have been locked up in an asylum. The book really makes society take a deep stare into itself to observe what is happening to the people of the nation.     Being an English literature major in college, I had the opportunity to read countless classics and consider myself to be well read. I can honestly say that \\"The Bell Jar\\" is the only book that is considered a 'classic' that has ever made me cry uncontrollably one minute (when reading about the electro shock treatments) and then a few moments later be laughing hyterically (when Esther gives the nurse a piece of her mind when he serves her two different kinds of beans in one meal).     This book is a must read for the female population, and I recommend everyone reading it. I don't really know why but I had a tendency to compare Esther to Holden Caulfield because of her self destruction and her \\"could care less about what is right\\" attitude. It's such a shame that Plath took her life so early when she clearly had an incredible gift of writing.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I just bought this album. I was a little hesitant after reading some of the mixed reviews on her voice, etc. Being a singer myself, I am a little disappointed that she is not hitting all the high notes like before. BUT I have to say that despite that, this is a great album. Most of the songs are very catchy and I find myself singing them all day. My favorite song - Like I Never Left with Akon. Wonderful song. Akon's voice fits perfectly and is so soothing and Whitney's vocals are awesome as well. In conclusion, even without her full vocal capacity she still sings better than half of the \\"artists\\" out there. Whitney is back and she's still got it!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Ok, so I'll start this rather honestly by stating that if it weren't for my total adoration of the film adaptation of `Where the Wild Things Are' I wouldn't have any clue who Arcade Fire was.  But, thanks to the strategic placement of the flawless track `Wake Up' in the trailers for that glorious film, I was brought to a nostalgic place that moved me to pick up this album.<br /><br />Finding a genre to place Arcade Fire in is hard.  They seem to be a genre all their own.  There is obvious rock influences here, but there is also folk and pop and an almost theatrical aspect to their music that makes it larger than life, or at least take on a life all its own.<br /><br />I'll start by breaking down the `Neighborhood' tracks.  There are four of them.  The only one I dislike is `Laika', which is a little too abrasive for their own good.  Win's vocals are not the best in the industry, but he uses them effectively on most of the tracks here.  On `Laika' he abuses them and the band comes off like a garage band trying to be `hard'.  It just doesn't work for me.  `7 Kettles' is drastically different, creating a calming feeling almost, with a fluid serenity that calls to mind something almost ethnic (I get an Irish folk type vibe here).  `Power Out' feels like controlled chaos, and I like that.  The vocals are a little harsh at times, but the overall catchy flow of the track is infectious and totally lovable.<br /><br />But, of the four `Neighborhood' tracks, the best is easily the opening `Tunnels'.  This is the first taste we get of what this band can do, and lyrically and musically this song is stunning.  I love the softness that is created with the musical arrangement (that also likes to play with some backing guitar to create a fanciful atmosphere).<br /><br />These lyrics are just sublime.<br /><br />The rest of the album may even be better than these four tracks.  The delicacy of `Une Annee Sans Lumiere' is marvelous.  It has a lullaby feel to it, one that lulls you in all the right ways.  It is sincere and earnest and moving.  `Crown of Love' has a seemingly theatrical tone, something almost epic in production.  I get a very vintage feel from it (it defiantly has some aged influences) and the way that the track builds gradually is phenomenal.<br /><br />`Haiti' is bouncy and delightful in scope and presentation.<br /><br />`Rebellion' and the closing track `In the Backseat' are both stunning and very commanding.  The subtle emotional resonance of the strings accompanying `In the Backseat' beautifully contrast the commercial approach taken to `Rebellion'.  They are two very different yet very complimentary tracks.<br /><br />A great way to close out the album.<br /><br />But, what review is complete without total doting over the star track, `Wake Up'?  This track is, in a word, perfect.  From the intro, which rises and falls at just the right moment, to the tracks effortlessly heightened embrace of nostalgia and human enchantment, this is an unforgettable musical experience in itself.  Lyrically, the track is moving and stirring and unbelievable astute, and musically it understands its themes and captures them with the swift rapturous collision of sound.<br /><br />Easily one of my favorite songs of the decade.<br /><br />In the end I totally recommend this album.  There really isn't a low point (outside of `Laika').  Even though Win is not the most accomplished singer, he uses his vocal limitations to create a feeling of authentic emotional connection, allowing his blemishes to compliment his vision, not detract from it.<br /><br />Just buy this album!nd earnest and moving.  `Crown of Love' has a seemingly theatrical tone, something almost epic in production.

0307454541|1.0|I hated-HATED-the writing, the characters, and the majority of the book in general. It was clumsy and either poorly translated or just poorly written.  75% of it was some horny man's fantasy seeing as the main character sleeps with EVERYONE.  His married co-worker, the lady across the street, the young girl...SERIOUSLY? I was waiting for him to sleep with the niece or maybe the lady at the diner too.  Pretty much any character that was developed beyond a paragraph was shacking up with the guy. I couldn't tell if it was a cultural thing that I just didn't get or what but I didn't see the point of the majority of it and it just added to the growing list of distractions that made this book painful to finish.  ya ya ya, I get it, everybody wants a piece of the geezer...Get on to the plot already...if their is one.

B001HUHBAE|5.0|I am an unabashed fan when it comes to anything David Fincher.  This man has a demanding eye for detail and has an impressive pedigree.  I remember seeing this movie in the theater and walking out bemused of if I liked or disliked what I just watched.  I decided to purchase the Blu Ray (because I really just like David Fincher)and watch the movie for a second time.  This time around I was on the bandwagon claiming this is David Fincher at his peak.  The kicker is, I am not a special features guy, and I watched every bit of special features this had to offer because I was so enthralled with the finished product and the borderline obsessive-compulsive eye for detail this story contained.  I highly recommend this blu ray.  It is beautiful and the special features truly are special.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Most of what I could say has already been said, even by the one-star reviews. This book, as they mention, is not elegantly written. As a writer myself, always ready to critique a piece with an eye on craft, I must assert that this book is written exactly as it should be written-- from the heart and spirit of Marcus Luttrell. This book should be read for content, for its honest, intimate narration, for its testimony to courage, character, and the intensity of human experience. A  more polished manuscript might have obscured the essence of a content too important to be delivered in any but an authentic voice.    Luttrell suggests that his reason for not killing the Afghan goatherds was a loathing of what the liberal American media might say, and the possibility of his being tried for murder. He also mentions his Christian faith. Dare I suggest that his awareness of the moral stance against murder probably played more a part in the decision than he is ready to admit? It's easy to rail against political positions, especially when a deeper, more intangible, motivation underlies a decision that proves disastrous. In any event, this author carries festering wounds-- physcial and emotional-- that will haunt the rest of his days. He embraces these wounds in the writing of this book, and shows us that even in tragic, irreversible events, one can transcend one's fate.    Throughout the book, I was impressed and inspired by the team's demonstration of courage, commitment, and endurance in the face of impossible circumstances. One needn't hold conservative political views to appreciate the higher values illustrated repeatedly in the recounting of Lutrell's experiences.     Perhaps I am prejudiced. My cousin, David LaConte, was a retired SEAL working in Afghanistan as a private contractor when he was killed by a roadside bomb on November 13, 2009. Only now, after his death, am I beginning to appreciate the impact of his life.

B0031OCY2E|4.0|There is a big caveat to watching this movie and enjoying it, namely that you have to stick with it for at least thirty minutes or so to catch ahold of it and where it is going with the Matt Damon character.  Once you do that, it is nothing short of amazing most of the time. Damon is terrific in it and one would never suspect this is the same actor who plays Jason Bourne! He is a corporate nerd.  Make that super nerd.  He gets involved as an FBI informant for the crime of price fixing.  This is hardly the stuff of which riveting crime drama is made of as it is about white collar as you can get with your experts being accountants instead of pathologists.  You trace money to make a case, not bodies. If that was what the movie was about, it would be like watching paint dry.  What the movie is about is instead Matt Damon's character.  The FBI does not realize who it has picked as an informant or what he is capable of doing.  It only gradually begins to realize it and is horrified about the characteristics of its purported informant and witness. Damon never breaks character, which really makes the whole thing work.  If you feel like everything you have been watching is same old, same old, this is NOT!  I can't think of another movie like it.  I would push it up to 5 stars if it didn't take so long to get into it.

030745455X|5.0|I want to weigh in on the claim that these books are full of \\"misogyny and veiled pedophilia.\\" Someone has been peppering the positive reviews with copies of a long comment to that effect. I read Dragon about a week ago and I finished Fire last night, and the comment is hogwash. I've already addressed the issue in Dragon, and I was a bit worried that Fire might be harder to defend. No need to worry. It is not a \\"pedophile romp.\\" In fact the \\"pedophile\\" issue is a stale red herring. The real sex problem in the book is trafficking in women. There are descriptions of violent sex with teenaged victims, but again, the \\"action\\" is almost always second or even thirdhand. (The age of consent in Sweden is fifteen, according to Salander, so the teenaged victims are not \\"underage.\\")<br /><br />Fire is a faster, more intense read than Dragon. Salander spends most of the novel being pursued by the police, among others. The book begins almost idyllically, with her spending her well-earned gains from the adventures in Dragon and Blomkvist is gearing up to tear the lid off a high-level sex-trafficking ring. Then the reporters on the story and an enemy of Salander's are killed within a few hours of each other and with the same gun. From that point on, the pace is non-stop. I put the book down only when my eyes couldn't focus. The last hundred pages are a series of horrific, unlikely, convincing revelations.<br /><br />A word of warning: If you are a fan of tidy endings, wait until May 2010 to read Fire, because you will need the next book. Fire ends practically in the middle of sentence, after an event that you must learn the conclusion of, and it's in The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. I'm waiting impatiently.

1416562605|3.0|This book talks about all the things about India that everybody knows about but nobody wants to talk about. Afterall it is much easier and safe to be politically correct (or \\"culturally sensitive\\") to talk about its ancient spirituality and new age abrstract, and to avoid the topics of the filth, social and domestic violence, corruption, and miserable conditions of the poor and women, condoned by religion and \\"traditions\\". The metaphors of \\"rooster coop\\" and \\"the caged tigers\\" are appropriate for the conditions of the under-previleged, trapped in the rigid caste system and sense of helplessness. It is a well written book with important message, very dark, depressing and hilarious at the same time.  I am giving only 3 stars because I have read many books by English-speaking Indian authors, Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry by far the best, and they all seem so similar.  I guess I expected this one to be radically different, but it wasn't.
B0031RAOVY|2.0|I read the book,  Hachiko Waits, to my third grade class every year. We have researched the story of Hachi and have photos him and his statue in Japan hanging up in our classroom. Hachiko is an anchor text in my class and we refer to it often when discussing character traits like loyalty, caring and responsbility.   When we heard a movie was being made of out favorite dog story we were thrilled.  I explained to the children that this was a different version of our favorite story because it was set in America but the professor and Hachi were still the central characters.  Children love to see their favorite stories come to life.  I ordered the movie as soon as it was available.  Unfortunately I can not show it to my class.  Instead of making a movie true to the legend, about a dog's faithful devotion to his master, the producers chose to make Mr. Gere(the professor# and his relationship with   his wife#Joan Allen) more prominent in the movie.  One of the early scenes shows the professor coming home with the puppy and hiding it in a room in the house.  His wife appears and   seductivly invites him up to their bedroom for a proper welcome home.  While there is no nudity, the subtle sexual message is clear.   Scenes of the unmade bed and the wife's lingere are too implicit.   I am disappointed with the writers of this movie.  Why take a classic story and muddle it with such scenes?  Further on in the movie there is more time spent developing Richard Gere's character while he is away from the dog then the time spent with Hachiko. Did producers have to create a more developed role to get more recognizable actors to do the movie?  Some people may enjoy the movie but folks who are aware of the real story will be disappointed.  Educators do not purchase this film if you intend to show it to children.  Children today see far worse images at home on television, it is true, but our schools are held to much higher standards.  I would not risk the controversy.
0375842209|5.0|Reading this book was a new take on an old topic. The story is told from Death's perspective, with hand drawn pictures inserted throughout.  I enjoyed the non-traditional aspects of this novel.  The Book Thief is an intricately woven story of a German girl, an accordion player, and a hiding Jew during WWII all told from the memories of Death.  I highly recommend it.
1416972242|2.0|I read this series as a preview for my 11 year old daughter. Just let me say - she will not be reading them anytime soon. I have never written a review, although I devour books across all genres and belong to several book clubs. I feel the need to post a warning here - these books are not suited for everyone, nor are they appropriate for anyone under the age of about 17.    The characters are fairly well developed, if a bit overly dramatic. The plot line is fine and moves along fairly well. I am disturbed by the author using the threat of an incestuous relationship as the conflict between the two main characters. In fact Jace seems fine with having an affair with his own sister at one point. Obviously, they are not brother and sister (which we won't find out until City of Glass, Book 3), which is why Clare keeps harping on the conflict.     However, my big BIG gripe is the relationship between Alex and Magnus. I realize that most people thought that was the best part of this book as well as the next. I cannot fathom how it failed to escape everyone's notice that Magnus, who is a much (much!) older adult, is pursuing a romantic relationship with Alex, who is a minor. I realize that it is easy to forget their ages when you read the book, but condoning a romantic relationship of any kind - gay or straight - between a child and an adult is just sick. Would this be anymore acceptable if a 50 year old man was trying to get a 16 year old girl to go out with him?     This is even more condemning since this book is specifically peddled to younger readers.
B0037AGASG|2.0|Ok, yeah I get that this kid is cute, and let's face it, he's light years ahead of Miley Cyrus in terms of talent; high praise indeed.  As for this album, frankly it's quite disappointing, even by teen heartthrob standards.  First, the selections are way too mature for somebody this kids age, second, the lyrics are laughably bad.  I really thought there would be one song id like to import to my ipod, but alas I was sorely mistaken.  Im sure the tweens will make this a huge hit for Bieber, but next time kid, find a producer that can find a writer to help create an album 3.0 you dont want to burn.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|This movie is awesome. SPOILER WARNING !!!    however it seems a wasted opportunity as they could have made it more thrilling by elaborating on his hallucinations. For example, at the beginning, they should have shown fellow crewmates that Sam would interact with (making the audience believe that they are real) and sometime soon it would be revealed that they are all his hallucinations.    Then they should have introduced the clone into the mix without giving right away that he is a clone (as its done in the movie) and lead the audience to think that the clone is also imaginary.     Until, the clone figures out whats going on and embarks on a mission to \\"wake up\\" the original Sam to make him realize that the clone is infact real and all other crew is hallucinations.
B0002SVW3O|3.0|My reaction to \\"Von\\" generally veers toward a favorable one. Sigur Ros was right to populate the cover art of \\"Von\\" with pictures of infants; their sound is definitely embryonic here. \\"Sigur Ros\\", the first track, contains echoes of  early releases by Landing (\\"Oceanless\\"), Auburn Lull (\\"Alone I Admire\\"), and Stars of the Lid (\\"Gravitational Pull...\\"), although I'm sure this is entirely coincidental, as none of those CD's were in print at the time that Sigur Ros recorded \\"Von\\". I was expecting a slightly more cohesive flow to the CD, and believe that they could have easily done away with tracks 4 (\\"Leit and Lifi\\"), 6 (\\"18 Sekkundur...\\"), 8 (\\"Verold Ny Og O\\"), and 10 (\\"Mistur\\"), while also trimming the 6+ minutes of dead air from 12 until \\"Rukrym\\" kicks in. What is left over definitely presages that Sigur Ros was on their way to developing their signature sound, with tracks 3 (\\"Hun Jora\\"), 5 (\\"Myrkur\\"), 7 (\\"Haffsol\\"), 9 (\\"Von\\") and 11 (\\"Syndir Guos\\") the most indicative of the direction they would take, and track 2 (\\"Dogun\\") providing an intriguing transition from track 1 (\\"Sigur Ros\\") the aforementioned massive ambient piece.     Other reviewers have taken pains to indicate that \\"Von\\" does not possess the polish of either \\"Aegenis Byrnum\\" or ( ), so I can strongly advise someone new to Sigur Ros to start with one of those two releases (preferably \\"Aegenis Byrnum\\"). If you are already familiar with their subsequent releases, however, this CD is worth getting simply to trace the genesis of their sound; just remember to program around every even-numbered track after 2, and fast forward through about the first six minutes of 12.
B002KREVCO|4.0|A great set! I love hearing Bon Scott songs that I HAVEN'T heard before! Even the Brian Johnson songs are unique! It's like getting a couple of \\"new\\" albums. A must for AC/DC fans!
0756655730|5.0|The book is what it says. Very detailed, yet still brings the subject to life, so to speak.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|Hmmm... A lot of different sounds on this album. Some new, some old. An O.K. effort, but not their best. I had high hopes for this, so that may have tainted my feelings on this one. I was a little disappointed, but not completely. After all, it is the Scorpions.
B002ZHKZEM|4.0|I'm a long time fan of Dr. Who, and a huge fan of the new series. I grew up watching the tom Baker and Peter Davison years on PBS back hoe in New Orleans and was trilled with it's return in 2005. These specials, which mark the end of Tenth Doctor David Tennant's reign, are great stuff. Waters of Mars in particular is a tour de force which takes the character to places he has never been while remaining faithful to the entire history of the old and new series that have come before.<br /><br />Since I have a lot of the classic series as well as the new ones I've gotten spoiled by the exemplary extras 2 Entertain have produced across the board. I'm a fan of commentaries and they have produced some fantastic ones. Unfortunately out of the five specials here on the last two, a two part story featuring the return of The Master, has any commentary at all.<br /><br />In addition we have yet to see a release of the Confidential in which Matt Smith is introduced as the Eleventh Doctor. That came out well over a year ago.<br /><br />On the good side we are not getting gypped out of content on the Confidentials as we usually do. Unlike the cropped versions that have come out in the region one season sets these are all the full length episodes broadcast on the BBC.<br /><br />Then comes the other thing that robs this one of it's fifth star: Five specials on five discs? Honestly, what next? Double-sided discs? It just makes no sense and it is a bit annoying to have to change the DVD after each episode, especially with the two part End of Time.<br /><br />Good stuff overall, but not quite up to the standards I've come to expect from 2 Entertain. Let us hope they redeem themselves when they release Matt Smith's first season.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|The Box is ok. the plot is very predictable. The movie itself is sad but true. It is a true portrayal of all that is wrong with our society itself and why we are in the world of trouble we are.
B002VECM4A|5.0|The video was deliver promptly. This is a thought provoking movie. I hope a lot of people see it. Thanks for your good service.
B002NXSRVG|3.0|As with any typical comic book / cartoon turned movie project, character development takes a sideline because of the sheer number of characters in the film. Recent examples include Transformers and Spider Man. However, as someone that grew up with the GI Joe cartoons, action figures, vehicle toys, etc... I felt this movie was moderately acceptable.<br /><br />My biggest complaints are with how they changed re-imagined the story, and the cheezy CGI. Physics don't apply to any of the action sequences. Scarlett, while being smoking hot, \\"performs\\" feats in a motorcycle that break every law of physics to the point it was painful to watch. The accelerator suits were a nice touch, but the CGI didn't make them seem very probable even in the near future. I love Sci-Fi and mech suits, but I thought it would be a bit more palatable if the accelerator suits had jump jets / flight capability ala Apple Seed.<br /><br />The good parts are still aplenty. The Cobra/MARS fortress and the GI Joe base fall into the same category of \\"crazy, but apropos\\" concepts found in the original cartoon. The underwater weaponry also aligns with the laser-beams that they used in the cartoons.<br /><br />Overall, I give Rise of Cobra 3/5 stars and recommend it as a rental on the weekend. Grab some popcorn and just relax.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites growing up and now my two boys (age 11 and 14) love it.  I remember my friends in Junior High quoting from this movie and now my boys quote it all the time.  A true classic and one of the greatest comedies ever!
B001P3SA94|4.0|Read the other reviews, which are going to be better than this one. I was blown away by the music in the film until Beyonce showed up. Okay, she´s doing an acting job, playing Etta James. But, she doesn´t sing like Etta James, she sings like Beyonce, which is unforgivable; she is not playing herself and should not be singing in her style. Jeffrey Wright is not, by profession, a singer, but he does a stand up job as Muddy Waters. Actually, he is pretty amazing. But Beyonce is no Etta James and doesn´t even try to be, which she should have.   Other than her flawed performance as one of the greatest jazz singers in history, I loved the film. Granted, as others have pointed out, it is a history written in highpoints. But, ya know, it´s a film and can´t include everything. Leonard Chess and Sam Phillips were probably the most important pioneers in the recording of indigenous music in the United States. Maybe somebody will do a good film about Sam Phillips.   Oh boy, I probably shouldn´t have said all that, but, as Jerry Lee said in one of his songs, It Just came out. Listen, guys. Good film. Jeffrey Wright is a terrific actor who doesn´t do enough, and man, the guy can really sing. The film at least gives an overview of how that great blues sound came to be recorded. You get  a taste of how things were back then, and how guys like Muddy Waters started out. Back then, without TV and internet, all these guys had to occupy their time were their guitars and harps and angst and voices.
B0033AX26I|1.0|As a musical experiment, San Patricio is interesting. As music it is a 60 minute and 50 second yawn - beautifully recorded but very little in the way of memorable songs. The historical exercise is just totally lost despite the names involved.
0767817664|3.0|I remembered loving this movie as a kid so when I saw it for just a couple bucks I picked it up. I have to say it wasn't what I remembered. The special effects were pretty good for their time and most of the actors were good too. The story is still entertaining, although 15 minutes should have been cut out through-out the movie. The constant need to convince everybody that a) the neighbor is a vampire, and b) they need to kill the neighbor dragged on and got kinda tired. Then there's the whole dance club scene that killed the flow of the movie for me. It just went on for far too long. Then there's the Evil Ed character, I don't remember him being nearly as annoying as he is to me now. But then again, Sesame Street isn't annoying when you're a kid either. Overall it's a decent movie, nothing amazing, but nothing terrible. If you want to see a movie that still stands the test of time watch Night Of The Creeps or Maximum Overdrive. Those movies have stayed favorites as long as I can remember.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|Like many, I can still remember the first time that I heard \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" all those years ago.  The Scorpions were an important band to me growing up although I managed to drift away from them for a good part of my adult life.  It came as somewhat of a surprise to me when I learned that Sting in the Tail was planned as their farewell recording.  It is with more than a twinge of sadness that I have been listening to this CD since it came out.<br /><br />The opener \\"Raised On Rock\\" starts out with somewhat of a nod to \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\".  While it might have been intended to be personally about The Scorpions, it is more than fitting for anyone who grew up listening to their earlier hits.  Sting in the Tail is at its high energy driven best with the middle tracks \\"No Limits\\" and \\"Rock Zone\\".  These are fist pumpers that will translate well when the Scorpions go on tour.  The one slip up comes on the title track.  I didn't care for the use of distorted vocals on \\"Sting In The Tail\\".  The song as a whole is not bad, but that opening makes me want to hit skip.<br /><br />Another staple of Scorpions music is the power ballad, and Sting in the Tail has plenty to offer here.  The first is \\"The Good Die Young\\" which serves as their tribute to those who have and will fight for freedom all over the world.  It starts with a clean, mournful sounding guitar lick that segues into Meine's lyrics that have been such a constant over the years.  While this is a strong offering, the high point for the ballads is \\"Lorelei\\".  A haunting combination of keyboard and acoustic guitar set the stage before Meine's vocals take over.  It serves as a modern take of \\"Die Lorelei\\" by Heinrich Heine, and it is vintage Scorpions power ballad material.  While the saying often goes that the third time is a charm, this doesn't necessarily apply to \\"SLY\\".  The instrumentation is solid, but the lyrics seem a bit off.  I was curious what the song was about after hearing it as it sounded like a plea for a long lost daughter to return.  It turns out to be a tribute to girls born in 1985 induced by the previous power ballad \\"Still Loving You\\" - get it?  It is also somewhat confusing that the summer of love mentioned here is 1985, but this unfortunately overloads the term that was already used for 1967.  This may seem a bit like picking nits, but Scorpions have set their bar pretty high.<br /><br />The closer \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" is a bit of a tweener so I decided not to lump it into the previous categories.  It may seem an interesting choice to close their final studio recording; however, it serves well in this capacity.  First, it signals the upcoming three year farewell tour that will support Sting in the Tail.  However, I think it also alludes to the fact that their contribution is complete.  Listening to their entire catalog over their career that now includes their finale is the best indeed.<br /><br />Overall, The Scorpions have put together a fine offering for their swan song.  Long time fans should find this more than satisfying whether you are looking for the fist pumping rockers or the power ballads.  I am amazed at the consistency in both the vocals and the guitars that regularly take me back 20-25 years when I listen to this music.  While fans will long for future recordings, it is good for The Scorpions to go out at the top of their game.  I would much prefer this over bands that keep churning out music well past their prime.<br /><br />Download this:  Raised On Rockfor a long lost daughter to return.

It feels good to be really enjoying music that came out in the 21st century.
0393072231|5.0|This is an awesome book!  Once you get started it is hard to put down.  What is the most interesting to me are the details of how all the pieces of the financial crisis puzzle are fitted together so you can see what happened.
B000002I2J|4.0|The last two cuts backfire, but every other song here is a winner. Unencumbered by theatrics and stripped of orchestras, The Doors get down to the basics of blues-based rock and roll. They even successfully dabble with jazz elements, especially evident on the scary omniscience of \\"The Spy\\".<br /><br />Jim Morrison's lyrical imagery has never been so potent. It fuses wonderfully into the band's most affecting music of their career that even \\"You Make Me Real\\" works as a good throwaway blues. There are autobiographical tinges (e.g.\\"Peace Frog\\"), the metaphysical (\\"Waiting For The Sun\\") and keen social observation (\\"Ship Of Fools\\"). There's Sinatra-laced tenderness on the straightforward ballad \\"Blue Sunday\\".<br /><br />Morrison's shot voice, hence organic, lends real power to their two greatest tracks ever, \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and \\"Land Ho!\\". Both these blues rockers make references to the bottle. His vocals are full-bodied and emotive. \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is bar-band blues played at its most authentic. \\"I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer\\" is so natural a line that you can just picture them performing this honky-tonk number in that bar lounge that graces the inner gatefold. \\"Land Ho!\\" is a sea chanty worthy of Chuck Berry or Bob Dylan. When he shouts \\"gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill\\", you know he ain't kiddin'. Robbie Krieger's guitar solos on these two tracks are propulsive. As a unit, they have never sounded this cohesive. This is a first. Concise.

Kurt Russell, you definitely want him to bring some of his \\"Snake Pliskin\\" / \\"The Thing\\" ultra-gritty badass. You don't get that and I really don't feel like elaborating. You just can't turn back the clock. :(    Early on, there's some neat film tricks blah blah.. scratchy record noise, B/W film.. it's just not all that good. I recommend you do not buy this film.

1582701709|4.0|The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne, is a book that focuses on the principle and theme of the law of attraction. Rhonda Byrne is an Australian television writer and producer who reportedly in 2007 was listed among Time's Magazine's 100 people who shape our world. The idea behind the book and the law of attraction in general is that like attracts like. In other words, when a person can dwell on positive and happy thoughts without falling back into negative thinking patterns, the world as they know it will improve and change for the better. Likewise, when one dwells on negative thoughts and unhappy emotions, the world as they know it falls apart. I personally see this book as a commentary to get all people started looking at themselves and taking personal responsibility for their life, for good or bad.    The book contains the following chapters: Foreword, Acknowledgments, The Secret Revealed, The Secret Made Simple, How to Use the Secret, Powerful Processes, The Secret to Money, The Secret to Relationships, The Secret to Health, The Secret to the World, The Secret to You, The Secret to Life, Biographies. It contains information and commentary from John Assarf, Michael Bernard Beckwith, Lee Brower, Jack Canfield, Dr. John F. Demartini D.C., B.Sc., Marie Diamond, Mike Dooley, Bob Doyle, Hale Dwoskin, Morris Goodman, John Gray, Ph.D., John Hagelin, Ph.D., Bill Harris, Dr. Ben Johnson M.D., N.M.D., D.O., Loral Langemeier, Lisa Nichols, Bob Proctor, James Arthur Ray, David Schirmer, Marci Shimoff, MBA, Dr. Joe Vitale, MSc.D., Dr. Denis Waitley, Ph.D., Neale Donald Walsch, and \\"What the Bleep\\" personality Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D.    The book does an excellent job presenting the basics of the hermetic principle of the law of attraction, also called the law of resonance. It uses the various people to teach and talk about the law of attraction, many of which share their own stories. Most of the stories are inspirational in nature and helps the reader understand what is possible in a world that today is focused on the impossible. Covering such topics as health, wealth, and relationships the book and the people presenting within the book do a good job at showing how powerful the law of attraction can be when believed in and used in the right frame of mind and context.    The only problem that I have with this book is that it doesn't go into enough depth to truly help people understand how the law of attraction works. Thankfully, people like Bob Doyle and Bob Proctor have been teaching the concepts within this book for years and already had well established programs on the law of attraction, programs which now can serve to enhance and expand upon what is taught within the contexts of this book.    As a side note, the concepts presented within this book are very important to developing a frame of mind that will lead one to success in life and to overcoming other people's negativity. For additional techniques on dealing with negativity consider [[ASIN:1432756192 Psychic Self Defense and Protection: An Energy Awareness Guide]] or [[ASIN:B00280LIVA Psychic Vampires: Protection from Energy Predators & Parasites]].

B000AADYUI|5.0|Sometimes my heart aches for the 60's and 70's  -- I was 19 when this album came out.  It's hard for anyone now to understand how things felt then.  There was hope, a sense of change, revolution, joyous discovery and exploration.  A feeling that &#34;we&#34; could make a difference. We did, but we were so naive. ;)<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums ever.  Every time I hear it, I get fired up all over again.  The other reviewers here have covered it well.  For me, &#34;Have you seen the stars tonight?&#34; really captures it all.  The hope, the love, the adventure, the belief.  I really, *really* want to take that spaceship journey.  (I grew up reading all the science fiction I could find...I think we all wanted to &#34;live it&#34; not just read it.)  This album takes me there. It really should have gotten that Hugo Award.<br /><br />&#34;Let's Go Together&#34; is another great song and Grace sounds wonderful on it. &#34;Hijack&#34; &#34;Child is Coming&#34; &#34;Starship&#34; - man, they're all great songs.  I love &#34;Baby Tree&#34; and sing it to this day.  This was the sound-track to so many good times.  It still gives me hope.  (And I agree with the other reviewer, for the real experience, listen to the core, original tracks alone as an artistic whole, enjoy the added content later.)<br /><br />This is truly a classic and a great trip.  Take it.

B000YENUI6|4.0|\\"Eastern Promises\\" stars Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts. Watts plays Anna, a midwife who accidentally gets involved with a Russian Crime family. Viggo Mortensen plays the leading man, Nikolai, a mysterious Russian-born driver for one of London's notorious Russian crime families, Vory V Zakone criminal brotherhood, which is feared and hunted by Scotland Yard and the CIA. Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) is the kingpin whose son, Kirill (Vincent Cassel), has personal issues.  Kirill is the enforcer and depends on Nikolai for friendship and help dealing with his powerful father.<br /><br />The first scene shows a young girl going into a pharmacy, she collapses and is taken to the hospital where she gives birth prematurely and dies.  They find bruises and needle-marks all over her body.  The baby lives and Anna, working as midwife, finds the Russian mother's diary.

0307454541|1.0|I thought this was a terrible book. Bad enough to take the time to give it a review.<br /><br />Most books I can understand the hysteria around them, even if I don't personally like it. This book is an exception. Graphic violent sexually abuse, descriptions of pointless meals, and heap loads of history on a boring family, helpless women that don't seem to do anything about their problems, and multiple side stories and characters that don't contribute in any way. Even if it was written beautifully, how could this be interesting?!<br /><br />I picked this up since it was all over the best seller lists and what a lousy excuse for a book.<br /><br />NOTHING seemed to happen, except for a few pages near the end, which didn't make any sense at that point since I was skim reading the book after about pg 150. The characters are not interesting at all, very stereotypical. Genius hacker, skinny, outcast girl, and the irresistible journalist who seems more worried about his sex life than solving any 'mystery.'<br /><br />So to summarize the book-<br />Journalist man does something trivial, genius chick is explained as not being a genius, but challenged, random sexual encounter, coffee and sandwiches(I wish I could do a search for this one for an actual count), description of clothes and financial/family history documents, repeat this pattern every 30 pages for the next 600!!!! pages.<br /><br />I could cut the book some slack and blame it on the translation, but if the guy translated coffee and sandwich scenes that many times, they must have been in the original.<br /><br />The editors need to take a chainsaw to this book, it could have been 400 pages shorter and the same amount of actual stuff that happened would not have been affected.<br /><br />The only reason I finished it is because I have no other books to read and to give credibility to this review. Please read something that isn't a waste of your time.

B001R4KQDE|5.0|This amazing movie was renewed on Blu-ray. With the extra features and added scenes this is one a fan of the series must own.
B001TOD9VI|4.0|Being that Mickey Rourke is in my top 3 favorite actors of all time I am totally biased towards this movie. I am quite touched that so many people gave this 5 stars. But me thinks it is not. Not quite.  I think the one scene of Mickey's self mutilation in the deli was very unecessary and in fact is the action of a psycho. Only Rourkes charisma could get one to overlook that. Also, I cant put my finger on it but something is missing in this movie. Its like the last Rocky movie where a man well past his prime does it one more time, but...???    I think it was rediculous how badly his daughter treated him for one mistake. She was no great shakes as an actor either. Marissa should have been his Adrian and not deserted him. Her character needed more depth and since strippers always go for the wrong guy....she was supposed to fall madly in love with Rourke! A better ending would be where he marries her, she gets pregnant, he goes back to wrestling for one more big score and dies in the ring. There just needed to be a bit more depth in this. And realistic or not, every woman I spoke to that saw this, couldnt watch the whole thing. They got sick from the blood. Truthfully I think we are all Rourke junkies and if he makes a remake of Lassie, we'd all rush to see it!  I saw it 3 times and thats my limit for this year. In the end though, its a must see for any Rourke fan. I'd give my eye teeth to see him team up with Eric Roberts one more time. Food for thought: What will Rourkes last movie be like when he is really old!?
B0019GJ4EM|3.0|Well, I say Blu-ray \\"transfer\\" rather than Blu-ray \\"master\\" because I do not believe this is a high-definition master. The picture quality is atrocious, with cheap edge enhancement applied to the image in order to try to achieve a sharper image without paying for a proper HD master. Some SD masters look fine when upscaled on a good TV, but this supposed HD image actually looks vastly inferior to decent DVDs. If you like/love this film, as I do, then stick to your DVD of it. If you don't have it, either get the DVD or wait until the Blu-ray is reissued in a newer edition. To call this high definition is an insult to the format and even more so to viewers like us whom the manufacturers seem to believe will buy anything they sell. I love this film and believe it deserves a lot more respect and special features like deleted scenes. Save your money. This review is concerning the British blu ray that came out Aug of 2008. Haven't seen the quality of the US release coming out Aug 3 2010.<br /><br />Received the new version 8-7-210. First the good news. The picture quality has been greatly improved. Almost too much. Watching the new edition it was clear that the Air Force One shot was a plastic model. The sound track blows the speakers out and is beautiful. If all you want is the movie, this will make you happy. Now the bad news. It has none, absolutely nada, special features besides the movie trailer. For $19 I would rather they gave the special features and threw away the DVD edition of the film, which I didn't need anyway. So if you have one of the DVD editions with the special features you can order this blu ray for the picture quality upgrade, throw away the included DVD and replace it with your older one with the special features. As for me, this is the last time I'm buying this movie. I'm still disappointed, but not as much.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I don't know why so many people thought this book was a dud. I think it is quite interesting. Maybe it's because I am listening to it and not reading it. I am usually on the edge of my seat the entire time I am listening to it. The book is exciting and has a decent plot. There are twists I didn't expect and it definitely kept me interested. The descriptions are vivid, but if you don't like/appreciate science/research, then you might find it dull and dry. If you are a fan of suspense novels and of conspiracy theories, then this is a must read.

B0018CWW8C|5.0|...if you love Fairport Convention, Renaissance, or British folk-rock in general.  I had no previous exposure to this group and bought it on the strength of the few 30 second snippets available courtesy of Amazon.  I have over 6000 vinly LPs and uncountable CDs, but this is the most rewarding item I've bought in years.  Seriously.  It's wonderfully melodic with some haunting interplay between instruments and nicely recorded. Some of Celia's vocals are just a bit shaky but enchanting nonetheless.  The remixed/reimagined tracks on the second disc are beautifully done, not just padding, and are a welcome additional choice to the finely remastered original.  I have never written a recommendation for anything before, but if I had reissued it I would offer a money-back guarantee if the buyer was not completely enraptured.  A TRUE LOST TREASURE!
B00337KM2S|4.0|i had mixed feelings going into this one as Clooney has never been a real favorite of mine.  i was, however, very pleasantly surprised.  the entire cast is very good and deserved the round of oscar nominations they received.  the film is very much a product of its time and to me, kind of felt like kindred spirit to The Graduate.  even the score allows you to make some comparisons to that classic.  very well done and enjoyable film.
1400052173|5.0|The history is harrowing.  The Lacks family is heroic.  The writing is rigorous.    Ms Skloot reports with understanding, patience, and love.    Her book is a triumph.
B002VECM6S|5.0|We had watched the story of the making of \\"Blind Side\\" for several months and decided to buy a copy for our collection. When we finally got the DVD we were throughly entertained by the movie and will probably watch it again soon.<br /><br />As I said in the title it leaves the family feeling much better about life and people whereas too many movies seem to do just the opposite. I can recommend this movie for anyone seeking encouragement about life today; there are a lot of basically good people living their lives and making positive contributions to the lives of others. From that perspective alone the movie pays dividends to the purchaser.<br /><br />On top of all that it is a fun movie to watch; Sandra Bullock does a convincing job of being a no-nonsense mom that takes action when required. This is, I understand, an accurate reflection of Leigh Anne Tuohy in real life. This brings up my biggest complaint with the DVD; it is sorely lacking in extras such as background footage on the real Tuohy family. Many specials appeared on the media, but nothing appears in the DVD about the family who was the basis for the film. It seems all of the special goodies were reserved for the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />In all I recommend the film but warn you the DVD has only some deleted scenes as a special feature. If you want the full blown version you better go to the Blu-ray version.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|This is a bad film. I got bored during one of the many over long and ill-paced action sequences involving some cars and trucks and fell asleep. As a film it is poorly paced, poorly scripted, poorly acted and the plot is awful. If you want a gritty action film in the 'Bond style' (as this abortion was intended to be) you would be much better off watching Bourne. If you wanted some classic bond thrills and spills you will be sorely disappointed.  The only topless scenes are of Daniel Craig and unless you find male testicular flogging a turn on there is little for the lads here.     My advice, don't watch this film unless you are the type of moron who loves bad films and think the idea of a 30 minute scene in which a bloke runs around on cranes is 'well cool'. (Its not)
B001HBX91S|5.0|This is an interesting disc in several respects; the first one for me being the audio options available to the listener. On the opening screen one is given the option of choosing between PCM Stereo, PCM Surround, DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby True HD Surround. That alone is worth the price of admission as it could help address the never-ending question about which audio format sounds best in your system. I am not personally aware of any other disc which provides this opportunity.<br /><br />Moving on, the music and performances cover a wide variety from Puccini's comic opera \\"Gianni Schicchi\\" to the rather stilted and strange work by Rameau, \\"Zoroastre.\\" A friend of mine who appreciates music has several times asked to hear this disc again, so it definitely exhibits a charm.<br /><br />I'm a ballet fan and have a high level of respect for the Paris Opera Ballet, their selection from Act 2 of Swan Lake is beautifully done as I would have expected. I was a little surprised with the staging in the selection from Il Trovatore where in the famous \\"Anvil Chorus\\" scene they show some action with a prisoner being saved from being shot while the chorus is singing instead of the anvil scene with sparks flying.<br /><br />On the whole there is more to like than to dislike and I'm glad I added it to my collection.
0061673730|4.0|I don't think I have anything new to say that hasn't been said before (positive or negative). I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, four stars out of five for me. If you haven't already read it, I suggest you read Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter next. Hofstadter picks up where Pirsig left off and delves further into holism, reductionism, dualism, etc.

B0030Y11O2|5.0|This is Moore's best, I think. In his signature way, he documents the general principles, the relevant policies, the major players, etc. But he makes the general phenomena come alive by showing their effect on specific families and individuals. What's especially good this time is that he doesn't concentrate only on the negative. He also shows both major figures and ordinary individuals who are fighting for what's right and just, sometimes with notable success.    Some of the most memorable \\"factoids\\" that stay with you are the ironies: like the sign-making shop that stays in business mostly by making foreclosure signs; the fact that 60% of the foreclosure notices are processed through Moore's hometown and major disaster area Flint, MI; that a foreclosing bank hires a family to destroy their own furniture and household goods before leaving.    The outrages Moore reveals are intended to galvanize liberals to resist the greed and cruelty of American-style capitalism. But they are the very same outrages that provide the energy one sees among Tea-Baggers. Perhaps the greatest irony of all: among the Tea-Baggers that energy has been co-opted by capitalists like Dick Armey, Fox News, commodity traders, and even CNN now. In other words, the Tea-Baggers' energy is being used to support the very persons and policies that created the crisis in the first place.    What it comes down to is that liberals will love this movie (unless they just don't like Moore's periodic confrontations), and perhaps they'll be moved to act. As it stands, however, conservatives will hate the movie. Nevertheless, if the very same material were re-edited and disociated from Moore, Tea-Bagger conservatives would love it as much as liberals do now.

B00337KM2S|1.0|OK. We have Clooney as someone totally cut off from \\"normal\\" human relations who enjoys being a hired gun firing people. The extra shots of people acting like they've suddenly been yanked out of normality to be sent to a concentration camp only shows the movie-maker's ignorance of white-collar employment. In addition, try firing a minority without an entire series of formal warnings and you will be sued for racism. Anyone working in white collar position knows storm clouds are about to hit. If someone making $90,000 a year doesnt realize their job could end and has not prepared for it doesnt deserve to be making $90,000 a year. 3 months severance pay and being a minority (which would almost guarantee an instant hire at that kind of white-collar level) is hardly the recipe for a character's suicide.<br /><br />But what totally earned the ONE-STAR is the writer's schizophrenic symptomology in his characterization of the young girl. The girl is feisty enough to say \\"it's a number\\" when Clooney admits his 10 million mile goal, and is also confident in other areas that would make it INCONGRUOUS for us to see her throw down her co-worker's cutout because he doesn't ascribe to her ideas on \\"love.\\"<br /><br />This writer's block could be seen in Juno as well when the guy who knocks up Juno acts irresponsibly nonchalant while she adores him. The makers of this movie take characters and suddenly place them in incongruous situations simply because they started something they dont know how to finish. We are tested to see if we can sit thru Clooney's sister's wedding, and \\"we\\" - or should i say \\"I\\" - simply couldn't. Fast-forward to the credits.<br /><br />In addition to the absurdity of putting the Company video-hookup on hold, when it proved it worked better, is the depressing ignorance on Clooney's part (altho it's meant to show the opposite)  of putting an uncommitted groom into marriage, almost guaranteeing the failure and phoniness he had criticized earlier in the film.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is the very best comedy on TV at this point in time...PERIOD. The cast is absolutely top shelf. Also, it is extremely rare find such outstanding chemistry between the artists.     The younger cast members deserve particular recognition here. Let's start with Sarah Hyland (Haley), outstanding acting talent. Has anybody noticed when she smiles she is exactly like a young Natalie Wood? Ariel Winter (Alex) she brilliantly embodies the awkwark and frustrated middle sibbling. Nolan Gould (Luke) does a terrific job as the youngest child in the zoo.     My best review is reserved for Rico Rodriguez (Manny). He is outstanding. In fact, I would say award worthy. This kid has the acting talent and professional bearing to bring a multi fasceted and complex child to life. \\"Manny\\" is caught in the middle between dads and cultures. He manages to bring the humorous side of his life situation through at just the right moments. Very genuine. Congradulations Rico, you have earned praise for your work.    The rest of the cast is just as good. I just wanted to take the time and recognize the work of these fine actors.    Finally, none of the reviews on this page would be singing the praises of this television series if it were not for the outstanding work of it's writers. I beg, I entreat you, to please keep this group together as they clearly have developed continuity and depth with their characters. The ability to do this and seemlessly integrate them into a storyline is very rare indeed. Hopefully it is the precurser for many deserved awards to come.    Directors, please receive my compliments for successfully bringing it all together.    The moment the DVD comes out, it's mine. Congradulations guys for producing such a great, funny, entertaining and relevant show that has all of us awaiting the next installment.
B000Q67DEO|5.0|This is such an super, incredible, fascinatingly great album by one of the most diverse and witty supergroups of the 'New wave\\" genre.  It is so good I'd forgotten just how great.  I played part of it for my bestfriend and he said, \\"wow, is this new?  I can tell it's Blondie, but I've never heard them do something so good!\\"  I told him it was actually an older album and he was amazed.<br />Shayla, is such an wonderful, super song it should've been a radio hit.  Radio was good to Blondie, but they never shared the truly great stuff over the waves.  Case in point, the practically no airplay of maybe their greatest album, \\"The Curse of Blondie\\"!!
B000024CPB|2.0|Mark Knopfler is unquestionably one of the greatest UK guitarists and songwriters of all time. Unfortunately, this concert, the second live album Dire Straits released and one of their last outings before they disbanded in 1995, is very disappointing and their weakest release, along with the studio album that accompanied it, 'On Every Street'.<br /><br />This album contains excerpts from one or two of the final concerts Dire Straits played in 1992. Instead of going for a double album (as they did with 'Alchemy') though, they decided to release a single disc/cassette, featuring only ten tracks.<br /><br />There is no questioning that the musicianship on this concert is first rate. The opinion of some people may be that this concert is more musically elaborate than 'Alchemy' and the concerts accompanying the hugely successful 'Brothers In Arms' tour from 1985-86. Unfortunately however, the raw sound that the band produced in those concerts that made them so uplifting and enjoyable is missing here. This is a much more laboured effort, and it clearly shows as nearly all of the songs on this release, even classics such as 'Private Investigations' 'Money for Nothing' are rendered impotent. The exception is 'Romeo and Juliet' which is superior to the 'Alchemy' version and probably the best song on here. Some of Dire Straits' most popular songs that they played during this tour including 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love', and 'Telegraph Road' have been omitted and instead a lacklustre version of 'You and Your Friend' made its way on to the album, which further weakens this set.<br /><br />The soloing on most of the tracks is excessive this time around and aside from 'Romeo and Juliet', this sadly makes 'On the Night' a genuine chore to listen to from beginning to end. Chris Whitten's drumming here is nowhere near as strong as Terry Williams, whose outstanding energetic contributions were always present from 1982 until he left the band in 1988.<br /><br />This album is anunworthy successor to 1983's 'Alchemy', which apart from a few weak moments is an excellent live concert which grows on the listener. Dire Straits should be remembered in their most classic years, 1982 to 1988. Their 1985-86 world tour was fantastic, as demonstrated by the superb July 10 1985 concert at Wembley Arena, which was televised on 'The Tube' in January 1986 but sadly never officially released on album or DVD. Their performance was at the Nelson Mandela concert in 1988 also came close, and was their last truly great concert (as well as their last concert with Terry Williams as drummer).<br /><br />With 'On The Night' Dire Straits sound tired and like a band nearing the end of their life. A disappointing, rather lacklustre release, which could have been a lot better. This is a shame as it ended up being Dire Straits' final world tour before they disbanded for good and Knopfler started his solo career.

B00012QM8G|5.0|In the Jewish family home, the Jews are reciting in prayer for the Sabbath day around a table full of brightly-lit candles, that go out while the Jews are away from the house.  Polish is defeated by the German forces.  This means the Jews have to leave their homes and report to the train station to register their names.  More than 10,000 Jews are shipped to Krakow.  This is where the \\"ghetto\\" is overcrowded with Jews.  The Jewish people bond together and organize into groups.  A German businessman, Oskar Schindler, visit the \\"ghetto\\" in hopes to see Itzhak Sten, a Jewish pot-making businessman.  For Jews, they are no longer allowed to own businesses.  Schindler makes a deal with him and plans to take over the factory after trading money and appointing Sten as the factory's manager.  All the Jews are now forced to pack their belongings and move out of their homes by German soldiers.  After arriving at the \\"ghetto\\", the Jews receive housing assignments and are forced to live in tight quarters.  The Jews that cannot work are loaded onto trucks and sent off to camps, while the others work at Schindler's factory.  Schindler tries to protect his factory workers by sending baskets full of goods to many German leaders.  The workers are grateful to Schindler for the jobs because it keeps them out of the camps and alive.  Thousands of Jews were shipped off on a train to concentration camps, where their entire luggage was gone through by German soldiers.  By mistake, Stern was placed on the train and had to be save by Oskar.  Armed German soldiers run though the streets killing the Jews and residents of the \\"ghetto\\".  Oskar arrives to the camp with lunch for the German men to find that he has no worker anymore.  They were all captured and taken off to the camp.  After getting back his workers, a young lady goes to him wishing for him to hire her parents, so they will live.  He hires them out of kindness.  Some of the Jews got sick, so they had to be separated from the healthyones at the camp.  All of the weak and sick Jews were killed to make room for the new shipment, so the ladies would prick their fingers and rub their own blood on their faces to make them look healthier.  At Oskar's birthday party, a young girl gives him a gift and in returns he kisses her.  This broke the Race and Resettlement Act by kissing a Jewish girl.  Goeth receives order to burn all the bodies of more than ten thousand Jews killed at the camps.  Schindler builds a new factory and bargains with Goeth to \\"buy\\" all the Jewish workers that is needed to staff it.  With help from Stern, he draws up a list of names, Schindler's List, consisting of more than one thousand one- hundred men, women, and children.  Racing against time, Schindler was able to rescue all his Jews.
0553807048|4.0|Ever the con man, Jordan Belfort is cashing in on the wave of Wall Street scandal books.  From  the title of this book you'd think it had been written about Ivan Boesky or Michael Milken.  Traders and bankers who worked on Wall Street shook their heads when they read the headlines in the New York Post.  Who on earth is this guy?  It's telling that Belfort was the \\"Wolf of Wall Steet\\" in the New York Post--not the Wall Street Journal.<br /><br />Jordan Belfort had a brokerage on Long Island that pushed penny stocks to retail customers who didn't know any better.  The odds of success were stacked against the clients and fees ate up their money.  Belfort says his script came from Lehmann but that hardly matters because his product was worse than junk.  He made a fortune but he was not a financier, nor a tycoon.  His crime had the hallmarks of small time crime and the crimes he committed were all about simple, everyday lying and fraud--oh and money laundering, can't forget that.<br /><br />But Jordan  is a genius--no question.  He's a genius of a salesman, and his appitite for exageration won't quit, even when it means exagerating his credentials as a criminal.  He thinks big--really big.<br /><br />Jordan Belfort is also a natural writer.  Though I certainly would not let my money anywhere near him, I enjoyed reading his observations of the people around him.  The long descriptions of wealth and ill gotten gains, drugs and prostitutes are the background but the really interesting parts of the book happen when he describes the prosecutors who who worked with him in the U.S. Attorney's Office, his second golddigger wife Nadine, his accountant known as \\"Chef\\" (because he could cook the books), his Russian mistress (the one and only former Miss Soviet Union!) and many other people.<br /><br />Belfort tells us many stories of drugs and crazy behavior.  The strangest thing is that all the money seems to have done little except to make him miserable.  I hope he keeps up his writing but I'm not sure he will ever understand that money really is not what makes a person happy.l ever understand that money really is not what makes a person happy.

B0034JKZ86|4.0|Apparently Disney's new \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" underperformed at the box office, and after watching the film on DVD, I think I see why audiences were underwhelmed.<br /><br />No, the problem isn't the Afro-American heroine or the interracial romance.  In fact, I think the \\"humans\\" in the film are swell.<br /><br />Where the film falls short, in my opinion, is the design of the swamp denizens.  Though their characters are appealing, these are some UGLY critters, from the jazz-playing gator to the Cajun firefly to the frog couple itself.<br /><br />The cartoons that have made it big have always featured well-designed characters.  Think of Bugs Bunny, the Peanuts gang, or even the Simpsons.  Even if Homer Simpson isn't much to look at, he's a clever and eye-catching caricature of a shlumpy shmoe.<br /><br />Here the romantic couple are frogs walking on their hind legs, and I don't think you can make such an odd and unattractive duo the focus of a romantic comedy.  Tiana is charming and charismatic in human form, but as a female frog -- yuck!<br /><br />In addition, the film falls flat in its art design -- literally.  Even the Simpsons have a more three-dimensional appearance than the characters and sets in this film.<br /><br />Finally, the songs in TPATF aren't much to write home about -- Randy Newman has done much better before.<br /><br />TPATF is definitely worth a rental, but a purchase?  I don't know...
1585673927|4.0|As the last remnant of a decadent aristocracy, it was Bertie Wooster's job to knock about, dining at the club and interacting with others of his social status who had inherited a small trust fund and who were now awaiting the deaths of their maiden aunts, so that their personal fortunes could be aggrandized.<br />Throughout the ten stories included in this volume, Bertie requires the assistance of his man Jeeves to select the correct stockings and shirts so as to be properly attired within his set.<br />Bertie and his friends experience various difficulties which Jeeves resolves, often in an apparently humorous manner.<br />The book itself first appeared in the U.S. in 1927 and contains stories extracted from, and perhaps revised, \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" and the 1919 book \\"My Man Jeeves.\\"  The stories are each somewhat amusing, if you do not mind that the main character has his opportunity to knock about only because he was born to a trust fund, containing no graphic violence, sex, etc.  It would have been interesting, had the editor cited the first publication of each story.  The Overlook Press edition, being reviewed, is a durable hardcover edition easy to read and hold.  If you have never read a Wodehouse, this a good place to start.<br />For those enjoying P. G. Wodehouse, Amazon offers a cornucopia<br />of further selections.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Did not imagine I would ever like this kind of music. I was lead to this band through the following sequence of events: I liked Radiohead, then decided to borrow a disc from a friend that had some mixed tracks. One of them I couldn't place into a \\"style\\" (as meaningless as that can be), so I asked him about it. He said some stuff that included the term \\"post-rock\\". So, using Amazon as my nexus for all things musical, I hunted down \\"Post-Rock\\" as my search term and saw what it would feed me. After reading reviews, I liked the impression I got. Bought the album used, and have been listening to it for weeks. Cannot get enough.     Awesome, compelling, interesting album. Worth a listen for anyone who has never heard of this group before.
B0013FFMOK|4.0|I first encountered this story in Charlton Heston's \\"the Omega Man\\" way back in the seventies. It was dreadful.<br /><br />When I read the book I could see how far the script diverged from the novel. The novel was great and probably one of the first serious additions to the post-apocalyptic genre.<br /><br />I was all set to hate the new movie but a funny thing happened when I watched it: unlike so many uninspired remakes, this one stood on its own merits. Like \\"the Omega Man\\", Will Smith's \\"I am Legend\\" is so different from the book that it's almost unrecognizable.<br /><br />Frankly- seeing an empty New York was creepy. Seeing all of those familiar, crowded places *empty of people* is enough to put a shiver down your spine.<br /><br />Watching the world fall apart from a plague that science is helpless against is the mother of all nightmares.<br /><br />This is NOT Casablanca but it's a good spooky story that is well worth watching.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Everything about this movie musical works! The casting is perfect, the plant looks and moves great, the songs are catchy and memorable AND I actually care about what happens to the characters. I know I've never mentioned that in my other reviews (maybe I have but I really can't remember right now) but, and maybe this has been said before, but me, as the viewer, invest a lot of emotion and care when I see all of the characters sing about wanting to passionately get out of Skid Row or Audrey's dream of being with Seymour or the two leads pronounce their love for each other. It's all done with great energy and passion! And maybe that's why the test audiences responded negatively to the original ending and I can see that. You so want to see these characters together but Seymour's subconscious greedy ambitions leads to his and Audrey's ultimate downfall and Audrey II's achievement of global conquest. Now I've seen the original ending, loved every minute of it (Audrey's heart-wrenching reprise of Somewhere That's Green I think is what did it for me) and have been quite puzzled as to why audiences would've found that depressing. And I know this has been said before but it represents, albeit in an over the top manner, what happens when we give in to temptation. But I must admit, even with liking the original ending, that the filmed ending works for me as well. The characters get a good payoff and, judging from the surviving Audrey II bud, a little foreboding that the plants might succeed anyway. Well that's what I get from it. Rick Moranis is perfect as Seymour, ably portraying the nervousness he feels when he goes to kill Steve Martin and (as previously mentioned) his yearning to leave Skid Row is very believeable. I only wish that the full rendition of The Meek Shall Inherit was present instead of being completely glossed over. His solo really adds to Seymour's dilemma of either killing the plant or continue with his success just so Audrey would stay with him. Ellen Greene, reprising her role from the Off-Broadway production, is, again, perfection as the ditzy yet vocally powerful Audrey. Her rendition of Somewhere That's Green brings a tear to my eye almost everytime. And Levi Stubbs as the always hungry Audrey II is the real show-stopper! I especially love it when he sings Suppertime; the piano matched with his vocals as he tempts Seymour to kill Mushnik is both menacing and suspenseful. The rest of the cast is brilliant; Vincent Gardenia as greedy Mushnik (though kind of sad that his musical numbers were cut, but maybe that was done to make him a less sympathetic character in the end), Steve Martin plays the dentist perfectly and his song is very memorable. The celebrity cameos don't seem gratuitous at all and actually add to the story in their small way. And the Greek chorus fit so well into the story that they're musical numbers don't feel jarring or confusing at all (unlike the continuous jumping back and forth of musical sequence, story, musical sequence in Chicago).e, reprising her role from the Off-Broadway production, is, again, perfection as the ditzy yet vocally powerful Audrey.

030726999X|3.0|I loved the first 2 books of the series.  They are fast-paced and tightly written.  In \\"Hornet's Nest,\\" the reader begins the book to find Sandler incapacitated in the hospital, having been shot several times, and buried alive.  She remains that way for a big chunk of the book.  Other intrigues are woven into the plot, which helps move things along.  It seems to me that there are more characters in this book than the others, and the names were difficult.  I had to keep a list.  \\"Hornet's Nest\\" is worth reading, but not as fast or compelling as the first 2 books.  Although this book could stand alone, I wouldn't recommend it.  The reader is brought up to speed on past events, but reading these books in sequence will provide a far richer experience.
0307388840|3.0|Atonement, by Ian McEwan, is one of those rare books that I don't like. I have observed in recent months that the more I anticipate a book, the less I seem to enjoy it when I finally have the opportunity to read it.<br /><br />The story is that of Briony Tallis, who during her childhood witnesses a brief incident between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie, the son of a servant. Her young and imaginative mind make the encounter into something dirty and disastrous, and Briony lives out the rest of her life struggling to make atonement for her accusations against her sister's lover.<br /><br />I didn't particularly like Ian McEwan's Atonement at first. The book progressed (for me) very slowly and I found it difficult to pick up the threads of plot that should have been holding the overall story together. When I was finished, I swore that I would never read this book (or anything else written by McEwan) again. Three months later I realized that I was wrong.<br /><br />While Atonement didn't surprise me in the way that it seems to surprise other readers, it did leave me with an aching desire to know more, to go deeper, to have a greater sympathy for Robbie and Cecilia, or even Briony. Atonement left me with an ache that wouldn't go away, and told me that I would read this book again.<br /><br />Atonement is incredibly slow, and the story could be told in a few paragraphs rather than 496 pages. At times the book was overwhelmingly descriptive, even repetitive. The characters (yes, all of them!) are unlikeable and perhaps too realistic as a result.<br /><br />But those characters have stayed with me for a reason, and I know that I will read (and enjoy) Atonement again.<br /><br />Ian McEwan has a gift in this respect: I can't stop thinking about this book. Whenever I look up and see it on my shelf, a little pang of longing goes through me: a desire to read the book and experience it again (and perhaps again). You never know, Atonement might just wind up on my \\"favorites\\" shelf!
1416955070|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think it is a good beginning to the series.  So without spoiling anything I will say that there are two things that I would say are supposed to be surprises but one of them I saw coming kind of early on.  The other I did NOT see coming until it started to unravel and I was reading it going, \\"No? Really? Oh wow.\\"<br /><br />I don't think I have really read anything like a Shadowhunter before.  It is an interesting concept.  There were a couple of times that I started to feel like it was slow but then it would pick back up with some kind of action.<br /><br />I like Clary, Jace and Simon.  Simon is that best friend character that in this story wasn't necessarily a primary character but you still hope things work out for him.  Clary is the character that you can relate to the first time you read the book because you are in the same place as her in learning about everything.  Jace is the guy that is sarcastic and can be annoying but you can't help but like him.  I feel like I didn't get a lot from Alec and Isabelle.  I guess with the connection they have with Jace and with what there parents had done in the past I was expecting more.  Although with this book it was about Clary finding out about this new world and trying to find her mother, along with the two surprises we find out in the end.<br /><br />I do look forward to the other books.  The way that this one ended set it up well for another one without it being too cliffhanging.  You know of some characters that still have some things that you know aren't done yet and will come up again.  At least I hope so. lol

1439102937|2.0|Chasing Harry Winston focuses on a year in the life of Leigh, Emmy and Adrianna, three best friends living in New York and nearing their 30th birthdays. When faced with some serious disappointments in their lives, the ladies decide it's time for a major change. The ladies vow to undergo this challenge together, making a pact to each change one major thing in their own lives, while helping to keep each other on track.      The dialogue in the many conversations between the girls felt natural and there were a few chuckles along the way, but the characters were extremely stereotypical. There's the beautiful trust-funded socialite, the serious workaholic, and the timid mouse; and each of them has exactly the type of relationship you'd expect (torrid affairs, solid and stable, and the doormat). The story moves back and forth between each of the three girls lives and I found this made it feel a bit jumpy at times. It was also very predictable and took a frustratingly long time to get to exactly where you knew it was going. Then the story ends rather abruptly without really showing us the better lives the girls had built for themselves.     As you may have guessed, I didn't exactly love Chasing Harry Winston. I almost didn't finish this one, but I thought there would be some payoff at the end. There really wasn't enough of one to warrant recommending this.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I just joined Amazon & ordered my first movie. I got it fast & cheap. (Me Likey!) I know this movie was not quite critically acclaimed, and makeup and lip syncing were not perfect, but I enjoyed 'jamming' to the score and scoping on Emmy Rossum. Gerard Butler rocked it out too. The Music, Emmy, and Gerard are why I bought the movie once it got cheap. Thank You Amazon for having budget priced movies. JMR
B001NLKT60|5.0|Stieg Larsson's follow-up to \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" was better, in my opinion.  The first of the series was a bit over-technical for me, but still a good read that left me looking for more.  I was not at all disappointed in the sequel.  There was no particular techno-jargon, just good writing that held me until the end.  Although nearly twice as long as the first book, it took maybe half as long to read because of the lack of the aforementioned techno-jargon.  As in the first book, the dialogue was believable and its use added to the  the story.  \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is really a book about Lisbeth Salander than Michael Blomkvist, as is \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.\\"  All the characters of Millenium are there except for old Henrik Vanger.  There is some continuity with Harriet Vanger, the heroine of the first book, taking a supporting role, but that part of the story is less believable.  The story opens with Lisbeth ending her travel around the world and returning to Stockholm.  The police are believably short-sighted and there are officers with agendas and prejudices as one would expect.  The ending sufficiently tied up the loose ends, but does leave one wanting for more.  The Kindle edition of the conclusion is due out on May 25, and I can hardly wait!
0316044938|4.0|I picked up The Lovely Bones on a whim, not long before the movie was released to the theaters (and I still haven't seen it). I figured that I probably ought to review the book while the title was still a popular term on Twitter and in the search engines. Truth be told, I was hoping for a traffic boost that never came (on my old blog).<br /><br />Whatever my intentions for picking up and reading this book, I am very glad that I chose to read the story of Susie Salmon, a fourteen year-old girl who was sexually assaulted and murdered by her neighbor. The story is told from Susie's point of view as she speaks from her version of Heaven, looking down on her family as they grieve her loss.<br /><br />The story of The Lovely Bones is less about Susie and more about her father and her sister, both of whom suffer greatly due to her loss and struggle to uncover the mystery of the man who killed her and hid her body where it was never found.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones isn't a mystery novel: that disappointed me. Right from the beginning (the first chapter) we know who the murderer is (enough that I'm comfortable putting that information in a review!). Instead, the story is about a family's redemption following the murder of a loved one. This is a subject that most families never have to think about, and it is very touching indeed.<br /><br />Two months after having first read this book, I can look back and say that while I certainly enjoyed it and can recommend it to others, it isn't a book that has stayed with me. As emotional as the reading was, I don't find myself attached to any of the characters in the book, and would classify The Lovely Bones as largely unmemorable but very much worth the read!

0061684384|4.0|High Voltage Tattoo is a beautiful book. Full gloss and full color, it forgoes the usual style of a biography for something closer to a coffee table book. Sometimes this tends towards excess: Deluy's crisp photos are sometimes Hollywood-slick (and Photoshopped), and the typography occasionally trades readability in for beauty. On the whole the book is a visual delight, lush and luxurious--but imperfect.<br /><br />Similarly, High Voltage Tattoo's content indulges but never quite surpasses expectations. Putting full paragraphs to things only summarized or glimpsed in the show LA Ink provides a more intimate look into Kat's art, and a biography and list of inspirations, along with multiple details scattered throughout the book (the highlight may be a directory of Kat's own tattoos), gives a small glimpse into Kat herself. Fans will find an intriguing amount of detail and background information to appreciate. But the writing style leaves something to be desired, and sections on Kat's body of tattoo work (portraits, sleeves, lettering, etc.) seem brief. High Voltage Tattoo doesn't quite go above and beyond: it's thoughtful, beautiful, and a priveledge to read for those intrigued by Kat Von D and her art, but it feels short and fails to offer all the depth that a reader might desire. Nonetheless, I recommend it.
B000EOTEPO|5.0|This is for sure many peoples favorite release from the band, and rightfully so, as it definitely is their most unique record in the catalog in my opinion. Epic and huge sounding, this is a classic album. Everything from killer cover art, to the lyrics... it actually transports you to the place you see on the cover of the album and makes you wonder; who is living in that cold and grim little ice castle that is sitting just on top of hell... or maybe that's just what icechests look like in Norway and they are camping and their campfire needs another log... Either way, this would be the album I would give to someone who has never heard or heard of the mighty IMMORTAL. Metalhead or not, You've never heard anything like this. IMMORTAL RULES!!!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Just about everyone who has seen \\"Avatar\\" has an opinion about the film. Put me firmly in the \\"impressed\\" camp. James Cameron has created what he intended: a trailblazing film replete with ground-breaking technology. Cameron has changed the rules regarding 3-D as a marketing vehicle, and he made a big mark when it came to sending a message about the effect humanity is having on the environment here on Earth. It is true that sometimes Cameron slips up with dialogue in Avatar, but this is nothing new for him; some of the same was visible in his previous films. Overall those movies stood up well, and so does Avatar. Others have criticized the plot, stating that is copied from \\"Dances With Wolves\\" or \\"The Last Samurai.\\" It is indeed true that Avatar's plotline is similar to both films, but the setting and characters are completely different, as is the central theme of environmental destruction-and in this case the natives win a great victory over the invaders. Cameron goes far beyond the other movies in that he creates an alien world, complete with original flora and fauna. He also invents a unique lifeform in the Na'vi; while they are basically humanoid in appearance, their anatomy and physiology differ greatly from Earth-based humans.<br /><br />I feel no need to go over the effects work and other technological wizardry of \\"Avatar,\\" as these aspects of the film have been analyzed to death by critics and moviegoers alike. I think the box office numbers provide all the evidence we need about that. \\"Avatar\\" has changed the ballgame when it comes to public perceptions regarding 3-D technology. Before Avatar, 3-D was basically a novelty. Now it is being shoehorned into films after they've already been filmed in 2-D (some of it rather poorly done), and 3-D televisions are the next big thing on the tech horizon. It's a likely possibility in a few years ALL movies will be in 3-D.<br /><br />I have seen the film twice, once at an IMAX theater, the second at a standard venue (both times in 3-D). I told myself I would not get caught up in the film the second time, as I wanted to analyze details I'd missed the first time around. I was unable to accomplish my mission: Once again, I got wrapped up in the entertainment and ended up tossing objectivity out the window. Therein lies the message of \\"Avatar:\\" It is at the top of the heap when it comes to the entertainment  quotient. All the technology involved in making the movie merely serves to show the audience a good time. Remember the line Maximus (Russell Crowe) shouted at the audience in one of his matches in Gladiator? \\"ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?\\" I was. Very much so. I will rent \\"Avatar\\" in this DVD version, but will wait for a future full-feature version with extras for purchase.).

B001PR0YGC|5.0|THE INFORMANT!<br /><br />STARRING: Matt Damon, Scott Bakula, Melanie Lynskey, Allan Havey, Joel McHale, Eddie Jemison, Scott Adsit and Tom Papa<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Scott Z. Burns; based on the book by Kurt Eichenwald<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Steven Soderbergh<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Comedy<br />Release Date: 18 September 2009<br /><br />What makes The Informant! a great film, is the performance of Matt Damon. How he wasn't nominated here is beyond me. He put on 30 pounds for this, and some of the best comedians out there could not have played this part as funny as Damon does. He's absolutely hysterical.<br /><br />His name is Mark Whitacre. He will remind you of countless people you have met in your life that have gotten under your skin. There are so many of them out there, that there's a chance a good portion of you reading this, could be among them! GOSSIPERS and or HABITUAL LIARS; people who live to spread rumors and lies and then sit back and watch how it all unravels. Why? I don't know why exactly, and I can't imagine being capable of doing it. But having seen the humorous effects it has in this film, you can at least appreciate the entertainment value it must reward these obscure individuals with.<br /><br />The company Whitacre works for may or may night be involved in price fixing. He runs with a hunch to the FBI. Soon enough, they are interviewing him and he is ecstatic. He often makes comments on the comparisons his situation has to that of one in any given `Crichton novel.'<br /><br />He has his wife involved, co-workers and friends are involved, and he seems to be telling each of them a slightly different version of the same story. The two FBI agents helping him are played perfectly by Scott Bakula and Joel McHale, and soon enough, they fall victim to his charades as well.<br /><br />What started as a simple investigation into price fixing, spans over several years and turns into a multi-million dollar scandal. The FBI has Whitacre wearing a wire for several of those years, in which he humorously narrates everything that is happening for the annoyed agents. Matter of fact, he narrates the entire film for us, in a series of very well written tidbits of useless trivia and conspiracy theories. These were some of the film's highlights.<br /><br />He also has a few attorneys take an interest in his case. At one point, immediately before walking into a prestigious meeting with some big-wigs, he tells the lawyers flat-out, \\"Listen, I haven't been tellin' you guys the whole truth... but I'm gonna clear that up in there today.\\" They swallow their tongues in desperate shock; we swallow ours in fits of rolling laughter.

B00005R8FI|5.0|Here was John Mayall in the spring of 1969---slitting his own throat, when Mick Jagger sought his counsel on a replacement for Brian Jones (who either quit or was pushed out of the Rolling Stones, depending on which version you believe), by recommending his own guitarist Mick Taylor for the job. At the same time, he was coming off perhaps his most successful personal artistic statement, \\"Blues from Laurel Canyon,\\" the first Mayall album to dispense with the Blues Breakers name and feature his own compositions strictly. With Taylor gone to the Stones and drummer Colin Allen accepting an invitation to join the ill-fated Stone the Crows, Mayall and teenage bassist Stephen Thompson were in need of new compatriots.    Mayall looked both ways to find them: Johnny Almond had been a session saxophonist for \\"Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton\\" and \\"A Hard Road\\" (intriguingly, he didn't join the band full-time when Mayall decided to bring in the horns full-time for a couple of years) and a sometime-bandleader (Johnny Almond's Music Machine); Jon Mark, the remarkable acoustic guitarist, was known primarily as one of Marianne Faithfull's arrangers and for his membership in Sweet Thursday (which also featured piano legend Nicky Hopkins and future Cat Stevens sideman Alun Davies) but had never played with Mayall before. Deciding to dispense with both drumming and with excessive volume, Mayall worked up a set of blues material that harked back to the music's roots and threw in a few folk and a few more jazz elements. After a round of rave reviews following a London premiere, Mayall declared his intention to record the new quartet in a concert setting, preferably at New York's venerable Fillmore East.    Which is exactly what he did . . . and found probably the best-selling album of his life, certainly the second-most familiar after \\"Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton,\\" and arguably his most artistically successful. Though each musician has his moments to shine---particularly Almond'shaunting saxophone during \\"So Hard to Share\\" (listen late in his solo, when he gets a double shot of sympatico from Mark slicing stabbing chords off his acoustic guitar and Mayall's quivery electric chords), Mark's deft improvisations during \\"California\\" (all you Dr. John fans, listen up carefully for Almond's flute quote from \\"Croker Cortbuillon\\"), Mayall's long-famous \\"Room to Move\\" harmonica and eerie \\"Saw Mill Gulch Road\\" slide guitar, Thompson's galloping bass during \\"Thoughts About Roxanne\\"---there's almost no star of the show. This is probably the most seamless and sympatico unit Mayall could call his own. From the moment Thompson kicks off \\"The Laws Must Change\\" until the second the quartet slams the final chord of \\"Room to Move\\" (the original set closer) there's a unison, a conversation between the foursome that Mayall only dreamed of achieving in the seasons leading to this set. Even better, Mayall saw and raised his own singing on \\"Laurel Canyon\\"; he's rarely sounded this genuine, this much singing from his own soul rather than trying to sing through the souls of his blues heroes. (Especially Mose Allison, Mayall's most obvious vocal model; the Allison influence is gone entirely here.)    The remaster's inclusion of material for which the original LP lacked room is more than welcome. It's all good material, particularly \\"Don't Waste My Time,\\" which sounds a little more assertive here than on the version that would introduce \\"Empty Rooms\\" only too tellingly soon afterward---a band this fresh and alive in concert should have made a studio album worthy of their concert attack, but didn't. (Considering Mayall wrote some of the most intimate material of his career for that album, the disappointment deepens.) But if \\"The Turning Point\\" wasn't as \\"innovative\\" as it was cracked up to be when it first showed up (did people really think Mayall invented the drumless modern blues band?), it was evidence that Mayall (who'd had a troubling reputation as a stubborn, to-the-letter purist prior to this) was more willing to think outside his box than he was credited with thinking. And if \\"Empty Rooms\\" ended up falling short of \\"The Turning Point's\\" promise, \\"USA Union,\\" with a different and slightly more daring lineup (Jon Mark and Johnny Almond---wasn't this a kind-of pattern in Mayall bands already?---discovered they liked working with each other more than both like working with Mayall, and left to form Mark-Almond), would keep the promise, albeit on its own terms.

0399242864|5.0|Once there was a boy and that boy loved stars very much. In fact, he could think of nothing grander than catching his own star to call his friend in How to Catch a Star (2004) by Oliver Jeffers.<br /><br />Jeffers's whimsical first picture book blends easy to follow text with sharp, clean illustrations to create something remarkable. Everything about this story invites readers to stop for moment and plan their own scheme to catch that elusive star.<br /><br />It's not easy to build suspense into a 32 page picture book, but Jeffers manages it.

B00122HW92|4.0|Cream ended its career as a full-time working band with a pair of shows at Royal Albert Hall in 1968 (it's criminal that the best of those shows was never mixed for a live album) in which they left the internal friction that splintered them---and most of what caused revisionists to dismiss them as virtuosity over substance in the years following their split---out the door and delivered some of their most inspired playing.    The shock of their banding up to play three numbers at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction a decade earlier was probably nothing compared to the shock of the trio reunited for two series of concerts at Albert Hall and at New York's Madison Square Garden (where they ended their final American tour, also in 1968). At various times had they been offered corporate sums to do it in the intervening years and turned them down, if you don't count one occasion when drummer Ginger Baker, experiencing financial difficulties, nearly gave in to the temptation to phone his former bandmates with the proposition, before he shook it off agreeing that was the wrong reason to do it. That the trio still had something special whenever they might get together (as they did every now and then when the occasion, but not the commerce, presented itself) Baker never doubted.    Was he right this time?    For the most part, yes, if you set aside your latent expectations that they might transcend dimension and time the way they originally did on their best nights, accepted that they were old compatriots taking one more rip through their legendary if somewhat inconsistent repertoire, and settled in for an evening in which about the only nostalgic touch was the screenboard behind their round stage showing varying washes of faux-psychedelic imagery that resembled a blur of the famous \\"Disraeli Gears\\" colour scheme and design.    They're obviously relaxed and having fun with the old repertoire and with their old split-up. (\\"Before we were so rudely interrupted,\\" Eric Clapton cracks at one point; \\"You're trying to embarrass me!\\" Baker warbles playfully, when Clapton introduces his turn to recite \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog,\\" that thinly-enough-disguised ode to the trio's pending split.) Maybe too relaxed---granted that they're not 20- or 30-somethings any longer, but it's a little jarring to hear material such as \\"White Room\\" or \\"NSU\\" played like a an elder bar band at a masonic picnic even if they flash a little of the old brio hither and yon, no matter how good Cream still is at delivering it.    It isn't anything of the kind, however, when the reunited Cream buckles down to what drove their formation in the first place, the blues. They have a bristling wrestle with \\"Politician\\"; Eric Clapton digs in passionately with \\"Stormy Monday,\\" a chestnut not heretofore associated with Cream, and even if you notice there's a little thickness missing from his Stratocaster rig (no Stratocaster ever got near the fullness of those Gibsons he played back in the year) there's no depth of feeling missing from the performance, either from Clapton in the frontline with one after another tastefully melodious improvisation or from Bruce and Baker walking beside him in the rhythm section and not racing past him compelling him to play catch-up. And they give Bruce's best blues, \\"Sleepy Time Time,\\" a zestful and almost lusty reading for a I-IV-IV-V blues ballad, with Baker unafraid of a little colourism in his cymbal punctuations and Clapton harking back to an old inspiration, Buddy Guy, for a series of smart legato figures.    What strikes home most is the trio's conscious restraint, even when they take a little of their former freewheeling, free-jazz-implicit improvisation ride, as they do now and then with such material as \\"Spoonful\\" and \\"Sweet Wine.\\" As if they took to heart some of the critiques (their own and the critics) of their salad years, they find ways to let fly without letting the heart bleed out of the music. It makes for a few awkward instants at times but makes mostly for engaging if not necessarily transcendental music, even if you might be thinking they're showing their ages a little too brightly. The effort is embracing.    We'll probably have to wait for someone to exhume the tapes of their legendary 1967 tours for the final, definitive Cream concert document, the one that shows most of all what the trio could accomplish when playing their most inspired music (which is not necessarily to say their most incendiary or flashy music). Until then, their reunion show material is pleasant to hear and worth having. Once upon a time people went to Cream concerts expecting to hear the fire of the gods. It's an odd delight expecting to hear a culling from Cream concerts that's not the fire of the gods but, rather, the soul of musicians playing as they are, rather than impossible-to-equal distortions of what people once expected them to be.
0393072231|5.0|I think it is probably best if THE BIG SHORT is read in conjunction with Charles T. Mungers THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HUMAN MISJUDGEMENT.<br />p.130 Jamie says \\"When something looks too good to be true, we try to find out why\\".<br />This, in effect is an antidote to \\"first conclusion bias\\" (Munger's tendency #5) where one must intensively consider any evidence tending to disconfirm one's own hypothesis, especially if the hypothesis is a good one.<br /><br />When Eisman says (p.156) \\"So why does the guy at Moody's want to work at Goldman Sachs, Tendency #1 (Reward and Punishment Superresponse)is at play: \\"Money is now the main reward that drives habits\\".<br /><br />What some claim as the \\"irresponsibility of the ordinary American\\" for the subprime lending problem, Eisman says,<br />\\"What- the entire American population woke up one morning and said 'Yeah I'm going to lie on my application? Yeah people lied.<br />They lied because they were told to lie\\".<br />This ties in with Tendency #15 (Social-Proof).<br />For example, Munger's dad was to go hunting in South Dakota. The price for a hunting license was $2 for residents and $5 for non residents. All of the group lied, using false addresses, claiming to be residents, so that they could only pay $2. Munger's dad barely prevented himself from doing what the others were doing, which was some sort of criminal offense.<br /><br />Eisman says it best when he says \\"the consumer getting screwed was not Greenspan's problem\\" (p.229) and thinks that \\"the upper class of this country r...d this country. You f....d people. You built a castle to rip people off. Not once have I come across a person inside a big Wall Street firm who was having a crisis of conscience. Nobody ever said 'This is wrong'.\\"<br /><br />Now, concerning reform. How do you incentivize people to say \\"This is wrong\\"? Is this the problem now? (If the financial crisis is a crisis of incentives as Michael Lewis thinks.)<br /><br />One last thought.<br />Whether Wall Street was the \\"dumb money\\" and delusional is beside the point: to believe so is to submit to Mungers Tendency #12<br />Excessive Self-Regard Tendency.<br />According to Tolstoy, (with which Lewis, incidentely opens his book),<br />the worst criminals don't appraise themselves as all that bad.<br />They come to beleive that either<br />(1) that they didn't commit their crimes or<br />(2) that, considering the pressures and disadvantages of their lives, it is understandable and forgivable that they behaved as they did and became what they became.<br />The best antidote says, Munger, is to<br />\\"force yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about yourself,<br />your family and friends,<br />your property, and the value of your past and future activity.<br />This isn't easy to do well, won't work perfectly, but it will work much better than simply letting psychological nature take its normal course\\"to believe so is to submit to Mungers Tendency #12   Excessive Self-Regard Tendency.   According to Tolstoy, (with which Lewis, incidentely opens his book),   the worst criminals don't appraise themselves as all that bad.

B0000CDJPQ|5.0|This adapter is small in size, does not require much storage space and fits the bill.

0553208845|4.0|Great book, with great sensory aspects. As well as subtle foreshadowing. I really recommend this book!
B003DRWX9I|4.0|Yes, I was shocked and amazed when I listened to this album.  I was expecting a mediocre offering at best, but what I found was a top notch (though certainly not groundbreaking) album.  There are only two tracks that could have been eliminated from the final mix - Gotten (w/ Adam Levine) and Startlight (w/ Myles Kennedy).  And to reiterate others' comments - far from being the expected filler, the track with Fergie is actually one of the highlights of the album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this show.  What more can be said except that it's sad no more episodes were made.  Firefly and 24 are probably the 2 greatest shows to ever grace a television screen.  What a gem Firefly was, maybe it's best that Serenity tied it all together in the end instead of a series getting worn out.  It is what it is and it was great.
0307463745|4.0|I consumed this title as an audiobook and truly enjoyed it. I opted for the audiobook thanks to the other reviews here that have pointed out that much of the material in this book can be found in the authors blog, which I can use as reference for ideas that I want to focus on or even comment on.     My digital (mostly open source) career began in 1996 and can say that I have lived the benefits of some of the recommendations put forward in Rework. Businesses that hold on to the practices that Rework criticizes have alot to be wary of if more start-ups, medium or even larger businesses rework themselves.     It would be very interesting to hear if non-digital business have as much to gain from Reworking themselves according to Jason and DHH.
038560310X|3.0|It was definitely worth a read and I am glad that I read it, but after hearing it hyped up time after time I found the actual book to be less than epic.  Too much of the book was worthless filler and/or nonsense, like a box spanning multiple partial pages that contains nothing but a list of examples of architecture, or a page long list of fictional names.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love this product. When I got it,Everything was there in the right place and nothing was missing. I watch it all the time. The best part was that I got this for $99 dollars because of black friday!!!!! THATS ALMOST $200 dollars that I saved when I waited for this. This was one of my best purchases on Amazon ever. I hope that you will buy this set!!!!!!!
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Received this item very quick! Of course I was excited because it's one of my fav's!
B000002OX3|5.0|I have to be honest. Technically speaking, 'A Quick One (Happy Jack)' is not one of their best. 'Who's Next' and 'Tommy' are far better albums from a technical point. But 'A Quick One' has to be among my personal favorite Who albums. Here, The Who seem to have more fun than on any other record. The songs they write here have a much more fun and upbeat sound to them then other Who records (with the exception being 'The Who By Numbers,' another personal favorite).     'Whiskey Man' is probably in my top 5 favorite Who songs. John Entwistle takes the lead here; he sings about a man who is going to perhaps an insane asylum and has a \\"friend\\" who \\"joins him when he drinks,\\" the Whiskey Man. But sadly, the Whiskey Man can't go with him.     'Boris the Spider' is another Entwistle song that features his incredible bass playing talent. This song would be a concert staple for the band well into the 1990s and up until his death in 2002. This song is a mod classic, and Pete's guitar is also interesting, with some feedback and reverberation thrown into the mix. A very interesting song.    The Who took a lot of influence from American R&B. On their debut, 'The Who Sings My Generation' featured covers of James Brown tunes and songs heavily influenced by Brown. Here, they tackle a Holland-Dozier-Holland (in essence, Motown) standard with '(Love is Like a) Heat Wave.' This song is very interesting, and further proves their R&B influence. It actually might be as good as the original, the Martha Reeves & The Vandellas version. An impressive cover.    But, the highlight of this disc is their early years magnum opus. The title track. Clocking in at nine minutes and thirteen seconds, this song is a clear indication of things to come, with 'Tommy' and 'Quadrophenia.' Even in 1966, The Who were fascinated with concepts and (mini) rock operas. A better version of this track can be found on the soundtrack album, 'The Kids Are Alright,' which was recorded at The Rolling Stones' Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.    Overall, 'A Quick One' is a fascinating sophomore album by one of the world's finest groups. Of course it's no 'Who's Next,' but it doesn't need to be. It's a fun album that takes it a step further than their 1965 debut 'The Who Sings My Generation.' Here, The Who dabble in R&B, straightforward rock, and rock operas. All on one record.    I recommend this album. It's one of my personal favorites, and it's really enjoyable.     Highly, highly recommended for any Who, '60s rock or just any rock and roll fan in general.    ENJOY!!!
B002IYEQR4|5.0|This is an incredible movie. The Ultimate Cut is amazing for fans of The Watchmen. I have the directors cut as well as the ultimate cut and with the extra scenes put in, it truly is an \\"ultimate cut\\". I cannot fault this blu-ray for anything, it has every thing a fanboy of the Watchmen could want, well, except for the space squid. I'm not getting into reviewing the movie or anything like that. I'm just going to say that if you love the Watchmen, you'll love this version.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I think this is the best Radiohead since OK Computer (sorry Kid A).  They get back on track and actually sound like a band and not a computer/techno group.  Jigsaw Falling Into Place seriously rocks and it would be worth the album to score that track alone!  If you liked the Bends and OK Computer then this is recommended for you!
B002ZG9788|1.0|Yet again I ask myself: If they didn't like the story of Perseus and Andromeda why did they use these names in the movie? Why not call them Bilesus and Jaena who lived on the planet raxz, for example? It would still be an idiotic story but at least it would not give us the impression we know anything about Perseus or Greek mythology.<br /><br />I didn't know much about Perseus before tonight but the storyline was such an insult to common sense and general knowledge that I knew it could not be right. The so-called hero of the story needs to fight a monstrous creature protected by some god (why?). He is offered help from another god but he refuses (a very smart move!). Then he accept help when he sees he can't succeed otherwise (of course, he couldn't have foreseen this need because humans can typically kill 90 feet monsters protected by a god, just with the help of a few good friends!).  He hates the gods, but then he doesn't really, or does he?<br /><br />Well, I came home and read about Perseus. I came to the conclusion that the Ancient Greeks may not have known how to make 3D movies but they could tell a coherent and interesting story! Apparently, that is too difficult for these 21st century moviemakers.<br /><br />Even the special effects were poor. The special creatures as very sketchy and are shown very briefly so they would not have to do a lot of detailed CG on them. Save your money or go see \\"How to train your Dragon\\". If you just like to see violence for violence's sake why not watch some wrestling, it's cheaper and more amusing.<br /><br />And where were the Titans? I guess in all the rush to have yet another person stabbed, bitten or crushed they forgot the title of the movie!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Look no further.  This is probably one of the greatest albums ever produced. I admit there are a couple of 'odd' songs, but Karma Police and Paranoid Android were two of the best songs of the 90s.  I rank this along with The Bends and In Rainbows as far as quality and style (of Radiohead's albums).  The only other albums I dig this much from the 90s are Live Throwing Copper, STP Core, and Alice in Chains Dirt.  These are all different styles of rock, but oddly Radiohead seemed to find a place on the very edge of grunge, despite being a British rock band with heavy electronic influence.  Oh, Thom Yorke is freaking amazing.  Seriously, this album is amazing!
B000MTOKZ0|5.0|I must comment on another review- since there is only one other review!..I agree about the album replica problem.Or more specifically the Rhino problem.I always feel i may scratch the cd as i put it into the sleeve.Also,i think they could've made it 1/4 inch smaller,so it would fit in with the other cds.That said,it is a nearly perfect replica of the original 12\\"album cover -and inner sleeve(complete with tiny lyrics!) Regarding the music:Guitar riffs ARE deceptively simple- but not in that bland pop(new wave) way...And though i'd heard most of these songs before- a few, many times over 3 decades-i never fully appreciated those lyrics.I knew they were clever,but they,also,were deceptively simple.Now,for those not familiar with this band at all...Not to offend a fellow reviewer,but the only band of those named that i could categorize this with is the Ramones- and that not for musical similarities.Television was near the grass roots of punk rock in the u.s.,along with Patti Smith,the Ramones,New York Dolls,Blondie,Talking Heads,James Chance,etc...By the time of the first albums,Blondie was far more pop,Ramones were far more simple,the Cars & the Knack (aside from mostly sucking)were just jumping on the bandwagon,and had absolutely nothing to do with punk...Velvet Underground & Bowie being from a Different era altogether- V.U.being practically in a category by itself,and being done many years before Television hit the scene;and Bowie having decided to become a commercial product by the mid 70's...It's hard to compare this band with another.Maybe Patti Smith, though this sound is brighter,somewhat more pop than the Smith Group's straight ahead rock tendency- and rarely exceeds maybe 120 words in a song,as opposed to Patti's 1000 word ramblings...Let's just say this:There's A LOT of guitar here.The drums & bass are clean and clear.Tom Verlaine impresses me as a former kid in school who knew he was supposed to be a star,but the other kids didn't see it,and he made it justto spazz out on stage,spilling his poetic,insightful and sometimes agonized guts out for all to see...and guitars.
B002LL13AM|3.0|Pollini shows how perfectly WTC could be played with his virtuosic techniques, and the magic stops there.  Something is lacking here. I just don't feel the kind of excitement that I usually get from listening to others.    The sound from this piano is indeed avergage, dull and harsh. I even prefer the sound from the recent Chopin recording by Argerich made decades ago.     Call me crazy, but I like Barenboim's WTC better.
B000002I55|4.0|Complex and interesting.If you dont already Love free jazz(genre),dont start here.May i suggest \\"Ornette!\\";also \\"Ornette on Tenor\\"? and check out Cecil Taylor...Then,before or after you get into David S. Ware,get this album...It seems to me that-even if all 8 players were playing passionately,this music doesn't stir passion.I feel that each was listening to 7 other players -or at least 3,and thinking about what the other 4 were doing -and concerned with making it work...and so,there are moments when one can identify with what somebody's doing,but no building intensity,no beautiful tension...no crashing waves...Just an intricate audio-lace.I'm pretty sure this was approached as an experiment at the time.A necessary one,to be sure.But Coleman matured, with the inter-influence of Cecil,Sunny Murray,Cherry,Coltrane,Dolphy,Blackwell,La faro,Ayler,Braxton,(earlier,Tristano) etc.He remained a genius innovator,and-though maybe not reaching the levels of intense passion that are a standard for David Ware,or Rob Brown-i think by 1962 he was playing with much more feeling than before.Plus,on those later albums you dont have to listen so intently...It will come for you. . . A word to you fidelity snobs: dont buy this.You'll just complain.
B0026I4EU6|4.0|For me, \\"Lone Survivor,\\" was not just an excellent high paced story of an American war hero, it was also a beautiful story of how Marcus Luttrell came to realize that there can be such immense goodness and kindness in people regardless of their ethnic background or religion.  He would not be alive today if it were not for the people of the village of Sabray.  They rescued him, nursed his wounds, and brought him to safety, even though they had to stand up to death threats from the Taliban to do so.       Unfortunately, some of the villagers, especially the village elder's son, Mohammad Gulab, are still receiving death threats from the Taliban.  I truly hope and pray that Marcus Luttrell will help both Gulab's family and the villagers of Sabray (many children there live in abject poverty) with the proceeds from this book, for the same reason that they helped him:  because it was the right thing to do and for no other reason.
B002ZNJWI6|2.0|I do read books that I like.  I'm sure my reviewer history is strewn with average to negative reviews.  I wouldn't be reviewing this book if I didn't see that the majority of reviews were far out of line with my opinion.<br /><br />1.  If you're a fan of Alastair Reynolds, by all means buy the book and read it.  The impact of this book was nowhere like the impact of his earlier work.  But it's not unreadable.<br /><br />2.  If you like \\"hard\\" science fiction you may like this.  Really, though, I didn't see any new concepts showing up here.  The technology happens outside the scope of the narrative.  The characters use it and it works reliably.  The only interesting concept I found going on was with the Vigilance and how the members therein dealt with their extremely long lives.<br /><br />3.  What I object to most is the waste of opportunity for the author to explore what it would be like to be a person who had been in existence for millions of years (even if most of it was in stasis) and fully alive for thousands.  The Gentians of the story don't seem to know each other well at all or even approve of each other.  Maybe the author's point is that all families are the same (but is so, it's a long trip for a shallow point)  In the end all I got was that the Gentian's were victims of their own self-editing.<br /><br />4.  Many of the editorial reviews call this book thrilling and exciting.  I found it to be a rather drawn-out talker of a book.  The characters talk a lot and do little.  They philosophize, they ruminate, they solve the book's great mysteries by leaps of understanding brought out through exposition.  Many discoveries happen outside the narrative stream and are announced.  Not the best storytelling.<br /><br />5.  What I did find interesting was the Abigail Gentian parts of the story which led off each section of the book.  Her conflict (up to the point where it had to dovetail into the genesis of the rest of the novel) was the most interesting and engaging part of the book.<br /><br />In the end the book turns out to be a fairly ordinary who done it.  The who's and the whys are no great shocks.  There are no memorable villains in the book, and maybe that's its largest failing.he book turns out to be a fairly ordinary who done it.

B0033AGPF8|5.0|If you're scared about getting shafted on an audiophile pressing, don't worry. This delivers the goods. Blows the reprise tri color out of the water, creams the two tone and sounds as good if not better than the Track pressings. Dead quiet, straight, great music. Keep the 60's pressings around for nostalgia, have this for the sound.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've been using these headphones for years! As with all headphones, the wires are subject to breakage when pulled, so I keep an extra pair or two available. They last for 2-3 months of fairly heavy usage. I listen to audiobooks and music while I'm ironing, cooking, knitting and walking. I started using this brand and style of headphones when the children were infants because the earpieces do not block sound. They just sit comfortably in the outer part of my ear. I've tried earpieces that came with my mp3 player, but I can't tolerate the irritation from having them in my ears. Heavier headphones flatten my hair and block sound. These are definitely my favorite headphones!
B002UNMWAG|3.0|As a big fan of the original Boondock Saints, I was really excited for the sequel to come out.  I was wary about it being just as good only because sequels usually aren't.  But reviews for it were not terrible and I generally think better of movies than most reviewers.  However, All Saints Day did not live up to my expectations.  It was still a good film.  But it didn't have the same feel as the original.  First, I could wrap my head around the fact that Sean Patrick Flanery was reprising his role because he looked almost nothing like himself from the first movie.  Second, there seemed to be too many attempts at comedy that diluted the action-packed feel of the first.  The original had just the right balance of funny/ironic and badass action.  Third, the plot was not as intriguing as the original although the twists are at the very least interesting.    Overall, I would not say it was worth the money but a good movie nonetheless.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|He definitely points out the hypocracy of the \\"capitalism is always right\\" crowd.  As always he merely points out the obvious (in stark detail)and then  poses questions that should be asked - then he waits for the far right to   lambaste him (calling him a commie) for daring to be patriotic enough to ask  why we don't deserve better. He's a true \\"brave american\\".  I wouldn't say it was his best movie, but it should be shown in the public schools.

Predictible, uncreative, unresearched, inconsistent...  Kate Beckinsale IS hot, but her performance was unconvincing.  I'm a US Marshall, but every time I see a dead guy I have a flashback every five minutes - her character was sent to Antartica for a REASON -> that reason is because she's S-T-U-P-I-D. \\"Why are there bullet holes in the plane?\\"  \\"How come the pilots stopped breathing?\\"  \\"Why did the plane rittled with bullet holes and with both of it's pilots dead crash?\\" \\"Is it possible for ANY surgeon or medical person to have been trained to give stitches in the same manner?\\"  \\"Why does my kitties breath smell like kitty food?\\"  That's about the depth of the MYSTERY in this movie.    Tom Skerritt was actually the best performer in the film - and that says something.  Respect to Tom.  Infact, I'm tempted to end myself right now the same way Tom did...  by saying, \\"Duces to this lame movie!  I'm going outside to freeze to death rather than participate any further is this farce!!!!\\"

I picked it up in the book store a few weeks later to read and found it too good to put down. I ordered it the same day, feeling strongly that it belonged in my library.<br />This was, simply put, the first comic - or graphic novel, rather - that I have ever counted among the best literature I've read. It was engrossing, engaging, and thought provoking, with enough ambiguity to keep anyone interested for quite a length of time. If you only ever read one comic, make it this one.
0670021652|2.0|I was so excited to see that Gilbert had written another book, Committed, I couldn't wait to buy it and read it. Unfortunately I was totally disappointed. This one is certainly not Eat, Love, Pray! It is a monologue on marriage, but a very poor one at that. I was hoping that because Gilbert had spent so much time at the ashram as well as spending time with the wise man in Indonesia that it would have some depth and some spiritual leaning. It has neither. It certainly shows her thought processes about the pros and cons of marriage for her, but none of the meaningful elements that bring depth and sustenance to a marriage of meaning, which I believe she has or I thought she had. It is such a constrast to her first novel that it will take a lot of convincing to buy another of her books, if there is such a one in the future.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings

B003DRGWE0|4.0|This is a beautiful fable written in a simple manner as fables are. I feel all Paolo's works are written as fables to be able to access as many people as possible. Fables are stories with a message. This one has many messages,that are timeless, it just depends on how deeply you want to delve into the messages and relate them to your own world. It is ultimately about self discovery and a young boy going on a journey hoping to find himself, not some hidden material treasure. The only real treasure is the treasures that we carry within. It takes him a long time and many adventures to realise this. Isn't this what any self discovery path is about? And yet we have great difficulty delving within ourselves because we do not feel that we may have any treasures worth offering to ourselves and to the world.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings

There are so many thoughts in this book to prompt our own thoughts to look at life differently, to view forgiveness as a means of release for ourselves and then of course of the other. Beautifully written!<br />Dr Gunta Krumin-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Octavarium isn't one of my favorites but it's still a solid album. At first I didn't care for it but over the years it got better. It's a bit lighter and less complex than their last couple albums. Change is a good thing and it shows the band experimenting a bit. It's original and different from their last few albums. These Walls is one of my favorite DT songs of all time and The Root Of All Evil is one of the best opening tracks. Personally I don't care much for Sacrificed Sons, Panic Attack or Never Enough though. I'd recommend getting it, especially for the epic 27 minute long Octavarium title track.

0143038419|3.0|What a journey this lady took herself on! Doing all the things that she had wanted to do. She did them to her fill and then moved on. It is the only way any of us can discover and explore ourselves and come to let go of our yearnings. Call it self absorbed. I saw her journey as a journey of living life, her life to its fullest. It takes courage to immerse yourself in your dreams and live them. We should all do that! She started he life living a probable existence and ended up living her possibilities - her destiny. Does it get better than that?<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings

0062513346|4.0|How amazing that Coelho purposefully went looking for the challenge to find the light through his own darkness. Most people stumble on this journey because of some event in their lives. Paulo goes seeking this challenge and ends up with a group of bikies. He knows how to make a tale interesting and not too confronting. The messages are there if you wish to see them, otherwise it can be just an interesting story. I feel Paulo is always pushing his own boundaries to see what he will discover for himself about himself. It takes courage to do that and it takes conviction and belief in the Divine.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
B00284G2IA|5.0|I have been a nightwish fan for years and I have owned end of an era for several years now also,It's one of my favorite live concerts out there and the last with Tarja,I have seen a few nightwish concerts and this one is the best i have seen for sound and picture,The entire band is spot on;)And comparing this Blu-ray to the standard dvd,well The picture isn't a whole lot better than the standard being the standard had a sorta washed out color look and thats not the blu ray's fault its the way the original was shot but on a good note the picture is sharper and color is abit better its not anamorpic widescreen like the standard was so its nice to have a full picture on my bigscreen its still widescreen just not anamorpic so no zooming ect needed for a full image,Sound is standard 5.1 or 2.0 so its the same as the standard dvd was which isnt terrible unless you want lcpm lossless hdmi TrueHD ect...But as for sound of the concert it rocks evem in 5.1;)All nightwish fans need to have this concert its one of there best and one i can watch over and over i have watched it 1000x and never get tire of seeing it,and its still a slight Improvement over the standard dvd and one of my favorite live shows ever;)
B00000JLWW|5.0|I always say idea is 10 times more important than presentation, but I'll make an exception for Titanic.  Titanic may not have the most original script in all of history, but at least its plot is kept simple and easy to follow while visuals and performance are given all of the focus and treatment.  The romance is still presented in a marvelous way, and it's what I walk away from the film remembering, even though I went into it for the fancy 1900's era visuals.<br /><br />The only thing that bothers me about the success of Titanic is it gives Roger Corman more credit than he already has in the film industry for giving Cameron his big break.  And I still can't forgive Corman for Swamp Diamonds.
B00000K0DT|5.0|I have seen this movie a dozen times and never get tired of it.  I waited to get a copy at a good price and this answered that wait.  The service is great.  Delivery fast and the quality of the DVD is as if it was new (I purchased a used copy rated Very Good).  I have since purchased another movie from the same supplier and anticipate it being another good buy.
1595141715|5.0|When I first heard of Thirteen Reasons Why and its premise, I knew I had to read this book. I've seen nothing but outstanding reviews for this book, not to mention the countless awards it has received as well. And let me just say, bravo Mr. Asher, BRAVO!    We follow Clay Jensen from the moment he finds the box on his door step until he mails it onto the next person. Clay comes home from school and finds a package addressed to him at his door step. When he opens it up he finds a shoebox full of cassette tapes, seven tapes in all. He goes out to the garage and pops in the cassette labeled number one, side A:      Hello, boys and girls. Hannah Baker here. Live and in stereo. No return engagements. No encore. And this time, absolutely no requests. I hope you're ready, because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you're listening to these tapes, you're one of the reasons why.      Now can you see why this book caught my attention from the very beginning? Trust me, you'll swallow it in one sitting. You'll stay up all night to finish this book.    Hannah makes the disheartening decision to end her life. She committed suicide by way of swallowing pills and she has left a suicide note in the form of the cassette tape recordings. To me, this is completely eerie! Listening to someone's voice, someone who is no longer with us, is haunting and eerie. It gave me the sense of false hope and denial. Like she really isn't dead. But she is. You're a day late and a dollar short.    From the book: The rules are pretty simple. There are only two. Rule number one: You listen. Number two: You pass it on. Hopefully, neither one will be easy for you.      Hannah threatens to release a second set of the tapes in a very public manner if the package doesn't make it through all of the people it's intended for. And since Clay received the tapes, he's on one of them and therefore he's one of the reasons. So, why is Clay on the list? He's a goodguy. He liked Hannah. I mean he liked her. What could he have possibly done to make this girl want to end her life? As I read the parts of Hannah's recording, I couldn't help but feel so helpless. I wish someone would have paid closer attention to the signals Hannah was leaving.     Thirteen Reasons Why is a compelling look at how people's actions, even the smallest ones, can have an impact on others. And what we might not realize is that these actions and the impact they cause can snowball into so much more. Asher's riveting debut novel on such a morose subject matter captured my attention and my heart.     Asher is definitely an author to watch out for. He has the ability to grab the reader and pull them right into the heart and soul of the story. Thirteen Reasons Why was a thought-provoking, page-turning read full of suspense. I was instantly pulled into the story from page one. Check back tomorrow for my interview with Mr. Asher!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my most favored movies from Disney. I have seen it many times on TV but when i saw it on Blu-ray i knew i had to have it. The order time was estimated about a week and i recieved it in 5 days. The package consisted of a Blu-ray as well as a digital copy of the movie. On Blu-ray the movie was absolutley outstanding. The sound was crystal clear and graphics were beyond imagination. The digital copy also came in handy because I downloaded it to my ipod so I could enjoy this spectacular movie anywhere! Overal it was a great price for a great deal.
1400034205|5.0|It is a testament to W. Somerset Maugham's talent that The Razor's Edge, one of his best works, came out when he was seventy, an age when even the greatest artists have nearly always lost almost all their skill. However, it not only has prior strengths in full force but even brilliantly displays new ones. It is essential for anyone interested in Maugham and highly recommended for general twentieth century literature fans.    One returning strength is the strong, deceptively simple prose perfected in Of Human Bondage. Maugham is one of the great English stylists; the rare writer who truly understands Jonathan Swift's definition of good style (\\"Proper words in proper places\\"), he always seems to know exactly what word to use and does not need more. The Razor's is a consummate example, packing a deeply philosophical, intercontinental story with a wide variety of characters into little more than three hundred pages. Another strength is vivid depiction of daily European life; Maugham focuses on the little details most authors ignore - food and drink, the minutia of physical appearance, etc. -, giving incredible verisimilitude. The novel is set largely in France, but we get a whirlwind tour of other countries; they seem to come alive in a truly rare way, and our vicarious enjoyment is as great as with any travel book. This is no less true - and perhaps more so - because unlike most writers, Maugham focuses on the low and gritty as much as the highbrow; his writing is very visceral, bringing out the best - and worst - of both.     There are also many new strengths. Quite remarkably considering that Maugham began publishing in the nineteenth century, the novel is in many ways truly Modern, not least in how he brilliantly inserts himself. His thinly-veiled Ashenden stories had of course done so, but here he is not only the first-person narrator and a major character but even uses his own name. Those interested in Maugham himself will thus be particularly fascinated, as how one puts oneself forth fictionally arguably says at least as much about one as a real self-portrait. We can see Ashenden remnants, but the character is essentially a writer - aging and cynical but still quick-witted and able to enjoy life while well aware of its tragedy. Such a thing is among the hardest for a writer to pull off, but he does it with aplomb. On top of this, he accomplishes the almost equally hard task of pretending the book is memoir rather than fiction. The opening confession, though fictional, is one of the most disarmingly brilliant ever, and similar asides are made throughout; this is the rare book that actually makes authorial intrusiveness an asset. I make a point of not reading back covers or introductions until after finishing the text for fear of something being given away, and all that need be said of Maugham's success is that I was not sure if this were indeed a novel until I looked. His accomplishment is particularly subtle and admirable in that the artifice was likely the only way of masking some improbable elements, such as the character of Larry, whom most will find too good to be true, and some of the things Maugham seems to reveal about himself. Yet, unless we knew before, the device is never obvious, much less distracting. As with so many of Maugham's works, though, there actually are significant autobiographical elements, and character models have been debated since publication. This complex fact/fiction interplay is truly Modern. Also relatively new for Maugham was using a cast composed almost entirely of Americans and setting a substantial part of the story in America. He is upfront about limitations so yet does it quite plausibly. The picturesque India portrait is even more enchanting - evidence of how skillfully Maugham worked his world travel into his fiction.    What really makes the book work for most people, though, are the characters. The cast is small but has some of Maugham's most memorable personages - his alter ego notleast. Elliott, one of his greatest comic characters, supports Maugham's initially strange claim that The Razor's is mostly comedy. However, though we laugh at Elliott's truly absurd superficiality and childlike reaction to being snubbed, there is far more to him than it first seems. He has some truly noble - even admirable - qualities, and it would take a hard heart indeed not to feel for him toward the end; he is pathetic in all senses of the word. Isabel is another character with more angles than is first clear, as is Sophie, one of Maugham's truly tragic figures. Yet he is too intelligent to simply condemn her because she lacks all conventional morality. Much the same can after all be said of the calculatingly cynical Suzanne, but she ends up a great success by any standard, and it is hard not to admire her ability and perseverance whatever we think of her methods. Gray, the prototypical Regular Guy, throws all these into stark and sometimes comic contrast.    Then there is of course Larry, the character Maugham immediately says the book will be about though he mischievously delays revealing it or him. One of literature's most nuanced characters, Larry is absolutely fascinating; his essential mystery is of course much of the attraction, but so is his depth. He is many things:  part Jesus, part Dostoevsky's Idiot, part Hemingway/Fitzgerald Lost Generation archetype, part proto-hippie. Larry is in many ways what makes the book, which begins just after World War I and ends just before World War II, epitomize its era. Things were changing greatly; all the idols that had sustained Western society for centuries - Christianity, capitalism, optimism, nationalism, insularity, materialism, faith in technology, etc. - seemed woefully inadequate. Like so many young men of his generation, Larry was unable to resume pre-war life. Scarred by death, guilt, and other feelings too convoluted to name, he becomes obsessed with finding meaning. Sadly, many could identify with his yearning, doubt, and malaise, and his search entails several well-worn paths. However, he was in many ways ahead of his time, anticipating the Dharma Bum soon glorified by the Beats and embracing the Eastern religion that Beats and hippies soon brought into vogue.     Maugham uses Larry to explore a wealth of important philosophical questions. The Razor's is in many ways a reverse Henry James novel, and Maugham indeed mentions James almost immediately. James was an American living in Europe writing about Americans in Europe; Maugham was a European living in America writing about the same. Like James, he usefully shows how this group - so numerous and important at the time, especially among artists and intellectuals - acts in numerous situations and interestingly contrasts Americans and Europeans. His most valuable insights, though, come from a piercing examination of America's twin pillars:  capitalism and optimism. They got the country very far in an astonishingly short amount of time, but WWI badly damaged faith in them, and the Great Depression was near fatal. Thus, strange as Larry seems in some ways, he really only took to their logical conclusion impulses felt by nearly all Americans. Refusing to abide by the classic American formula of working hard at conventional jobs for upward mobility, he takes a very different path. Maugham knows better than to say if he is right and gives several contrasts:  honest, hard-working businessmen; social climbers; mercenary women; and even professional whores. Only we can decide who is right. Maugham also makes notable comments on a variety of side issues, from marriage, sexuality, and male/female relations generally to high and low society. As elsewhere with him, there is also a strong homo/bisexual subtext that is getting more and more attention.     All told, Maugham packs an astounding amount of thought-provoking material into what is basically a short novel. Combined with amazing psychological insight, deft characterization, and a healthy dose of humor, this makes a truly great work. The Razor's does not equal Of Human but is excellent in all respects and has its own strengths; relative brevity may even make it a better introduction, and it should certainly be one of the first Maugham books anyone reads.
B000E6EH1S|5.0|The \\"Symphonie Fantastique\\" still remains as a landmark into the classical universe. In many ways, it might be labeled the summit of the highest peak of an artistic expression.<br /><br />It is far beyond and behind a simple symphony. It contains many elements that make of it unique and inimitable. The concept of the fixed idea, the suggestive landscapes and the cornerstone of what would be to come. The raising of the Symphonic Poem, with Liszt and Strauss as its maxim exponents.<br /><br />That feature is at the same time, the most difficult obstacle to surpass at the moment to perform it. Because you have to take into account this is an incorporeal score, where the kaleidoscopic nature permeates the work from start to finish. That requires a vivid imagination as well as an exuberant melodic flight all the way through and obviously a first-order orchestra to materialize this ambitious project.<br /><br />There have been countless versions over he years but just a few have been capable to express with majestic intensity and radiant lyricism its portentous meaning. Moreover, it could be stated that to win with this Symphony you must be hovered by a special pathos. And you may be sure Colin Davis has a lot of it. Besides, if you consider the presence of The Concertgebouw, what else may be requested? .This version captures with all the possible spell this magic poem.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B000056NX5|5.0|This show is great - pity I cant see it with the new DVD i just purchased - it says 'wrong region' & wont play!! but glenn carter is brilliant in this production. thoroughly recommend it to everyone, even if you arent the type to watch musicals.
0553593544|5.0|Robert Ludlum died in 2001, and for that I am profoundly sorry. It means no more of his superb books will be coming our way. I saw all three Bourne movies before I started reading The Bourne Identity, and I definitely recommend the books over the movies.     The Bourne Identity is reminiscent of Dan Brown's Angels and Demons or The Da Vinci Code, in the way that Ludlum starts you out knowing nothing, then feeds you little tidbits that keep you wanting to read more. My only regret is that I saw the movie first, so I know what happens in the end. I would have loved to read the book and find everything out at a slower pace.    The story starts when a small fishing boat happens upon a man floating in the Mediterranean Sea, near Marseilles, France. The man has been shot multiple times, and when the doctor at a seaside town manages to fix him up, the man remembers nothing. He slowly recuperates, and when several belligerent fishermen attack him, he finds out he has incredible fighting skills. He also has an intimate knowledge of firearms, and his face has been altered by plastic surgery. But he still remembers nothing.     He sets out from the small fishing village after five months of healing, and manages to make it to Marseilles. Following an address implanted in his hip, he goes to Zurich, Switzerland. There, he finds a bank account with his name on it- Jason Charles Bourne. Eventually he gets a set of instructions and substantial information regarding who he was before he lost his memory. But you'll have read the book to find that out.    Jason Bourne is an incredibly well-developed character, with emotions and reactions that one would naturally expect from an amnesiac on the run from assassins. The relationship between Jason and Marie is so believable, Robert Ludlum either put a price on his own head to see what his reactions would be, or has an incredibly vivid imagination. (I don't know about you, but I'm going to go with the latter.) The European locales are bright and easy to see, and his furious action scenes are face-paced and intense.     If you like books by Tom Clancy, Dan Brown, or any good mystery-thriller, I definitely recommend this book to you. It'll satisfy any need you throw at it.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I first saw Evangelion 1 on DVD and was blown away by this retelling of an already epic anime. The blue ray is even better, but if you already have the DVD you really don't need to Blue Ray unless you want the HD. If you are new to Eva then definitely start with this it will get you through the first few episodes. Long story short, this movie is stellar from start to finish hold on to your seats, sit back, and enjoy, strongly recommended
0743464117|4.0|Good book. It does show how miserable is front soldier's life, regardless of what he is fighting for. Quite disturbing for me was looting issue. Russians did it, same applies to Americans and British. Civilians were always the victims.
B0038OY6DW|1.0|What a tedious movie - no plot, no character development, no drama, no entertainment. Just endless and unpleasant cartoonish violence, it seems to have been designed to appeal to 12 year old boys. The jumpy direction only added insult to injury. Despite the potential of the cast, a total waste of time and effort.
B001IF9WJ6|5.0|I purchased this blue ray DVD via Amazon with a complete satisfactory. It relfects not only a high qulaity but also the cheapest price without a tax and freight charge (if you purchase two DVD with a combined price of over $25). No retail stores or other on line competitors can offer such low price.  I am sure that I will buy more DVD via Amazon.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Great Movie! Follows in the fine tradition of Star Trek's past and provides a promising future for the continuation of the franchise! Great casting. Great effects. Great storyline. And of course, Blu-Ray \\"boldy goes where no one has gone before...\\"
B00000G3PA|1.0|Armageddon is in the running for worst sci-fi movie of all time, if not one of the top 10 worst movies in general.  There is SO much that is either factually wrong or just plain impossible here that this is ***fantasy*** -- NOT sci-fi!  You might as well be dealing with talking dragons and Vikings with ray guns.  Preposterous plot, trite dialogue, and not one credible performance, either, save for poor, struggling Liv Tyler (struggling against the lousy script, that is).  The *really* annoying thing about this film is that some people who have seen it think that any of this absurd plot can really work in space.  Sheesh!!!    If you want truly entertaining futuristic fantasy (that is, devoid of any attempt to even hint at reality), watch The Fifth Element instead:  at least that film can laugh at itself and has some good lines.  Armageddon is nothing but hackneyed melodrama that gets just about everything wrong, and its plot is based on an impossible 'solution' (and a really dumb one at that).  Only the completely scientifically illiterate wouldn't be disturbed by this flick.  Armageddon requires not just suspension of disbelief but complete suspension of taste, good sense, and the laws of physics, too.  It's no longer entertainment when you find yourself yelling at the screen because of the sheer stupidity you're forced to watch here.  Give yourself a break and instead of Armageddon, re-watch a really worthwhile film -- 2001: A Space Odyssey -- and leave *this* mishigas in the trash where it belongs.
0307463745|5.0|I've lived so much similar situations...!!! The book help a lot to decide what's important and not. I appreciate to how easy and fast to read it is. Absolutely recomendable por nano, micro, small, medium and largr sise companies.
B002RI9XOW|5.0|I finally got round to reading this having seen the film a couple of years ago. If you enjoyed the film then you will certainly love this book.     Set in Nick Hornby's native North London, it's seen through the eyes of Rob, a DJ and struggling record shop owner who's latest in a long line of girlfriends, Laura, has just moved out of their flat. In his quest to search for where it all went wrong, he revisits old girlfriends while pining for his latest one. The results are very funny while a being scarily accurate picture of many men. Perhaps that is what makes it such a good book - the fact that you see so much of yourself within Rob's character.
0307277453|4.0|A good book, and interesting too.  It is surprisingly quick to read, and moves fast. Had to read it for a class, but it was more enjoyable than I thought it would be.
B00328G4XY|3.0|Always fun to see if there's much new in a remastered record.  I love this album -- it's the best of Jimi's releases (IMO).  The DVD is short and doesn't really tell much.  I can't say the remastered copy is much different than the other CD I have.  Great record, not so great repackaging.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Who  cannot remember when they were 12 and the friends we all had back then? THis story will take you back to your preteen years. I been enjoying this movie since 1986 when it was released on VHS video. I always wanted to write a story  about my childhood years and this one would have come pretty close.Get the deluxe edition with the special features. Comes with a special featurette \\"Walking the tracks: The summer of stand by me\\" which interviews all the actors and director. Very insightful companion to the movie. Also includes the music video which was done a few years later with an older Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix (and Ben E. King). You can get this movie in the 5 dollar bin at Walmart.
B00383YC2S|3.0|I wish we could go back to a Gourmandises style Aliz&eacute;e.<br />This album is good, but not great.<br />I am not exactly a fan of techno, but at least it doesn't over power her voice.<br /><br />My hope for the next album, is to have the techno sound toned down.
B000Y7U98W|3.0|***spoiler****      I don't think I've ever written a review on a movie before on Amazon, but I just have to vent.  This movie is so incredibly amazing until the last 25 minutes.  Maybe a top 5 fave for me until they completely ruin the atmosphere, drama and story about people sacrificing for the greater good.  How do they do this?  By inexplicably going supernatural with the leader of the previous ship sent on the mission becoming some sort of sun burnt sun god or some crap.  What a joke.  WHY!!!  Why do this???  Couldn't he have still been himself, just warped in the mind?  Why make him a supernatural creature of some sort.  I have nothing more to say really, other than I feel so let down by such an incredible first few acts.      Definitely the most letdown I've ever been during the course of viewing a movie.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Very good price for the quality. Packaging has been redone and is shelf friendly with nice plastic slim cases for each DVD. There is a nice jacket for each dvd case an episode list on the back.  Razor is included as stand alone disc and case. The Plan is on its own disc hidden inside the case of 4.0 disc 4. Toy Cylon is not included!    Very happy with this purchase.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I noticed that a lot of the reviews from the old packaging were still showing up under this item.  I just got my set in the other day and wanted to throw in my two cents.<br /><br />Can't speak for the old packaging but the new one is darn near perfect.  Each season comes in it's own case just as if you were to buy a single season from the store.  All 4 seasons plus the movie \\"Plan\\" are packaged in the box that you see above.  It also contains an extended version of the episode Razor.<br /><br />Overall it's very nice and I have little to complain about.  The outer box is cardboard and got dinged up a little bit in shipping but other than that it's a fantastic set.<br /><br />I have only seen this show on blu-ray so I can't really comment on how it compares to unconverted DVD.  Since it was produced to have a grainy look to it anyways, you might be able to get away with saving some money and getting the DVD set. Even better if you buy the item from Amazon.ca (Canadian version of Amazon) it's listed as only $150.  I paid $10 for expedited shipping and ended up getting it the very next day!!! Amazing deal and I saved 50 some bucks!
0061438294|5.0|C'est difficile évaluer le livre étant donné que je n'ai pas une grosse base de connaisance sur le sujet. J'ai trouver qu'il explore le sujet vaguement comme s'il donnait son opinion par rapport à la signification du language non verbal. C'est sûr que le language est différent dans toutes les cultures, donc il faut en prendre et en laisser...  Malgré tout, je le conseille à tout le monde.
0307275639|1.0|Take a tip from Morrie and go live your life rather than waste it on this horribly written book.  To sum up the book...\\"I'm dying...this is what its like to die..dying...the end\\".   There is no substance to this book and nothing to learn. Nothing is learned from the dialogue and it makes me wonder if the author even learned anything from these Tuesdays sessions with Morrie.  I grew tired very quickly of reading about Morrie talking about not talking about death.  Save your time and your money by not reading this, and you will be living a better life.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|This is not about the book but about Amazon. I got a mail telling me it is a free download at 0.00 $, but then Amazon tries to pull 2.30 $ for this 'free' classic. Seems they need every cent now to survive the iPad threat.
6305537321|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is one of the classic films that every other girl has in her movie collection. I admire Audrey Hepburn in the film. Her ability to play a nonchalant, confident lady speaks for itself. I like to take note of the fashion choices such as the timeless Givenchy dress she wears in the beginning and her cozy orange coat later on. George Peppard is not too hard on the eyes either.     There's a certain depth to this film. It captures subtle nostalgic moments such as when Hepburn encounters the salesman at Tiffany's, and he notes that it gives him a \\"sense of solidarity, a continuity with the past\\" to know that Cracker Jacks still puts prizes in their snacks. Or even the music choices in the various scenes give a richness to the mood. This film is not a clear romantic comedy; it tugs at the soul and hints at the cracks of humanity. Some people may pass this film as an overrated film, but there is a reason why it's a classic. Or many reasons.

After watching her concert and had listened to her songs, I felt so relaxed and calmed, at the same time dazzled by her voice.

I admire Amelie's brave endeavors to bring positive changes into her friends' and families' lives. She reminds me of me, but even better. I like how Amelie thinks of clever ways to help her friends notice the small pleasures. Her shyness is not weakness but her greatest strength. Amelie: she'll change your life.

B001OQCV2E|2.0|This movie is a silly adventure flick.  I had to laugh at how the family was escaping in California as it was going into the sea (I kept thinking \\"only in the movies\\").  This was a very disappointing movie and far too long at 2 hours, 39 minutes.  I really expected it to be more realistic and true to what is going to really happen.  It is true that our politicians have made amenities for themselves in mountains, etc, but to think they'll let the common folk on an \\"ark\\" and then we can start over, well first of all, they will only attempt to save themselves and secondly, there will be no ark in any case.  Well like I said, it's not realistic.  If you like fun and sci-fi, I guess this movie is for you.  If you are looking for something more like what's really ahead for the earth, you will be very disappointed.  I was generous in giving it two stars.
B002S0OBN2|3.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber is cursed by his original creation.  So is his sequel--or so it seems.  At unexpected places in the CD, the music halts for a second or so, then just as abruptly begins again.  Is it bad recording studio work, a misguided attempt to capture physical time lapses between scenes, or an over-excited troupe of Webber employees having too much fun at Coney Island?      Whatever the reason, these sudden and unexpected drop-offs in sound are most annoying to a CD listener who longs as much as anyone to enjoy the magnificant musical and theatrical skills of Webber and his troupe.     Coney Island is no place for the Phantom.  The enduring horror of his true character is diminished into spoiled brat antics within misquided screams of weary adults trying to drown out the sounds of failed freedoms.       Both the recording and the musical seem haunted by the real Phantom.  Can they overcome?  The real question is, can Webber and the Phantom?

The caldera is being watched and monitored everyday, but don't expect it to erupt like an atomic bomb in our lifetime. It is very safe to visit Yellowstone Park.<br /><br />  Will Hawaii be overcome by a volcano and lava flows?  Not all of Hawaii. Only The Big Island has currently 3 \\"active\\" volcanoes.

1594132666|5.0|I just ordered the book and look forward to reading it.  I have read some of the reviews.  I think it must be a good book for the publisher because it got so many reviews up and down.

0515142247|5.0|\\"Die Trying\\" by Lee Child is his second Jack Reacher novel, and it's a fast paced, tough, entertaining story of the capable hero who just happens to be at the wrong place at the right time.  Or maybe he was in the right place at the right time to become entangled in an adventure as he is kidnapped with an attractive female FBI agent.<br /><br />The tale has enough twists and turns along with good action sequences to keep you entertained and engaged throughout the book.  Former Army MP, Jack Reacher, is definitely a tough guy, and he definitely has a knack for getting involved when he senses something isn't right.  Fortunately, he has the strength, brains, and skills to make things right - his way.  A way that often leaves bodies laying cold on the ground.  Naturally the kidnapping is much more than a simple kidnap for ransom demand.  The plot twists around to a much larger conspiracy.<br /><br />Coming from Montana, I enjoyed some of the local references, just as I enjoyed the entire book.  I like Child's writing and the Jack Reacher series is a fun action filled escapism type of read.  I don't analyze each and every tactic, nor do I look for inaccuracies and so forth.  I read Child's Jack Reacher books for one reason, and that's because they are fun tough guy stories.  Reacher is tough and his adventures are entertaining.  I liked this one a bit more than the first, probably because of the Montana setting and the use of the sniper rifles.  Good, fun, action tale for some tough guy escapism reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks.

B002C6K7N0|2.0|Now that libertarianism and teabagging are the favorite political activities of the modern American slackjaw, it makes sense that Mustaine has flipped his typically aggressive political rhetoric again.  This is the thrash version of those obnoxious emails your aunt won't stop forwarding to you.  That said, the musicianship is definitely top notch: Chris Broderick can definitely rip, the album is full of shifting tempos and insane stop-start madness, etc. and so on.  That's the exact problem, though: it's just musicianship.  This band hasn't had any swagger or swing in years.  The undynamic, heavily compressed production style that's been such a blight on the majority of mainstream music for years is on full display here, too.    This record is just another yawner from Megadeth's twilight years.  People are enthralled with it and are calling it a \\"return to form\\" because it's full of speed-of-light guitar solos and Mustaine's tiresome howling and snarling about modern politics.  It's too bad that what made certain Megadeth albums special-Mustaine surrounded by musicians that were often at home worlds apart from thrash-is long gone.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I was skeptical when I ordered this version of the original Trek, but after only watching a few episodes I'm so happy with my purchase. The transfer is so clear you can actually see the stitching on Kirk's uniform in some shots. I'm seeing things from the show I've never seen before and this is coming from a Trekkie who's watched all TOS episodes dozens of times. There's a shot in Shore Leave when Kirk's talking to Ruth (near Vazquez Rocks) and you can see insects buzzing around the actress' head. This is something I've never see ever before and pretty funny when you consider the planet in the episode isn't supposed to have even insect life.<br /><br />The only down side is I wish more episodes had commentary or extra information. As it is only 1 episode per disk has such extras. The extras themselves are really well done and give info that even the most die-hard Trekkie will find new and fun. Also, these episodes are not edited in any way. Unlike when they originally aired on CBS with the revised special effects, the complete running time for each episode is here which I was SO looking forward to.<br /><br />In short, if you love Star Trek, you won't regret this purchase.

0307463745|3.0|I was hoping to get some insights from this book into how 37signals has achieved so much success. I wanted stories and details. Unfortunately, Rework consists mainly of aphorisms (\\"Don't be a hero,\\" \\"Ignore the real world,\\" \\"No time is no excuse\\") followed by a couple of pages of elaboration. In other words, the purpose of the book is to inspire, not to inform.<br /><br />That's a pity, because Fried and Hansson are smart, knowledgeable designers/developers. They do really good work. I wanted to know more about their process. For instance, Rework advises you to \\"start at the epicenter\\" on a new project. But the question is, where is the epicenter? How does 37signals decide to start a new project, and how do they identify the epicenter? How do they divide up the work? Those are the kinds of details I'd love to know (and which they go into sometimes on the excellent Signal vs. Noise blog). Advice is best transmitted by describing experiences, not by distilling those experiences into a few words.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These triggers are great. I always wanted to buy them and I finally came across them an picked them up for $5.00.<br />Theres really nothing to them.

There cheap and there great for first person shooters. I recommend them.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|This review was originally written for the SNK803K2.  The only difference is the color of the dial. But I bought this on too.<br /><br />For me this watch is fantastic.  If you know auto-winds (automatics), then you know their little idiosyncrasies.  So let's start there...<br /><br />Timing:<br />It's not a chronometer, it does gain (or lose) more than 0.5 seconds/day.  In fact, on some days it seems to gain as much as a minute.  Gaining time seems to be a common observation with other owners and reviewers.  My guess is that it is \\"set fast\\" at the factory, with the idea that \\"if we can't get it perfect out of the box, then it's better to be early than be late.\\"  For this, you could probably go down to your local watch repair and get the timing set.  Having said that, My watch normally runs about a minute fast over the course of a month and that doesn't bother me.  In fact, true to all automatics, it gains and loses a little time each day or so and it is generally the same \\"one minute\\" ahead of the current time for several months.<br /><br />Quality:<br />The watch is obvious quality.  Seiko is quality and they obviously get a great job on this one too.  It's quite rugged.  I regularly ride a both a mountain bike and road bike to work, which is 12 miles in one direction.  The watch take a vibrational beating, but never really misses a beat (outside of the range mentioned in the previous paragraph).<br /><br />Looks:<br />I wasn't keen on the style of the band that came with the watch, although it is tough and will probably never come apart.  I went a got a leather band, and this thing is beautiful.

Okay - but is a great way to help little kids to tell analog time, \\"The little hand tells you the hours and the big hand tells you the minutes.\\"  Was it planned?<br /><br />Recommendations:<br />I went out and got two more.  Another for myself, with a green dial (that my oldest son commandeered) and another with a blue dial for my daughter in the Coast Guard.  I was able to spend $64 a piece for these, so really, I think they were a great deal.<br /><br />I have an older, beautiful Omega Deville that I wear when the occasion arises, but to tell you the truth, I end up feeling just a little guilty leaving this watch behind for some event, when it really is my trusted time piece.<br /><br />However, after this...

B002VKE1K2|5.0|** Spoiler Free **<br /><br />You're either going to love or hate this movie.  I absolutely hated Blair Witch and never thought I would get into these types of movies.  For instance, I watched Quarantine and besides a couple \\"boo\\" moments I really never thought it was anything more than just another movie.  In twenty years, probably the only horror movie to scare me in any way was \\"The Ring\\".  I feel no shame in admitting Paranormal Activity did also.<br /><br />I suppose your enjoyment of this film will be highly dependent on how you view it.  For instance, if you're watching this movie on a standard television with a group of friends and everyone's joking about the movie and pulling pranks (normal horror movie stuff) then you will not get much out of this film.<br /><br />On the other hand, you can do like I did and watch this movie alone right when the day turns into twilight and slips into darkness.  In spite of the intentionally low budget feel to the movie, I also believe it is essential you have at least a half-decent surround sound system in order to maximize your enjoyment.  I left all the shades up to let the night in and by the time the movie ended, the house was pitch black and I found myself absolutely terrified.<br /><br />I'm a big-time horror movie buff and don't scare easily.  Try as I might to rationalize the dumb things the characters were doing, I couldn't keep the intense feeling of unease from creeping into me, like a spider crawling up my back.  Even after the movie ended, the frequent noises in my house started to take on an entirely new meaning and sleep was very difficult.  To the director, Oren Peli, I salute you!<br /><br />Yes, it's true you'll either love it or hate it, but if you're going to watch this movie, be a man and watch it alone; and definitely watch it in the dark.

It was a little bit disturbing at the beginning, but that was mostly because I was the same age as the main character, Susie Salmon. I can honestly say that I have never read anything like it and I probably never will, unless, of course, Alice Seabold writes any other books for people my age. It is full of sorrow and revenge and betrayal and romance. It ends in the most amazing way, so amazing it was almost beautiful. It was also really interesting because of the point of view, or at least the state of the main character. It begins like so: \\" My name was Salmon, like the fish....\\"As it clarifies in the sentences that follow, the main character is deceased and throughout the entire book she is watching over all of the people she grew up with from a distance.

B0036EBARO|2.0|Goldfrapp have always been derivative, their specialty \\"retro\\" -- albeit a look back at a different era or medium with each new incarnation. But no matter how you classify their shtick, there is no doubt that they have always done it superbly.   And no doubt their new effort, Head First, will find a large audience, new or old, that will find it just as superb. It isn't, however.  Their first album, Felt Mountain, was their absolute masterpiece, never to be equaled in terms of craftsmanship, elegance, and overwhelming melancholia. It was a nod to an old, bygone Europe, and one could practically picture Alison Goldfrapp as a happy, blond German Heidi of the hills, who is full of wretched abnegation and sexual frustration on the inside -- a perfect symbol of a dying continent between the wars. Where others have tried to convey that image by referring to Berlin's dens of iniquity, Godlfrapp were much more sophisticated: there was a brass-heavy polka, there were snippets of Jacques Brel, bits from different moments of history. The impression was even stronger in concert, where the atmosphere was largely produced by a violinist in lederhosen and a Tyrolean hat. Ironically, the album became a cult favorite but did not sell all that well.  The follow-up, Black Cherry, caught everyone by surprise: although it still carried several lovely ballads that seemed to come from Felt Mountain, it was primarily a dance effort that harkened to the early seventies and channeled Norman Greenbaum, of all people, along with primitive synthesizer sounds. It sold extremely well, and was a dollar sign that the band could not ignore. Sure enough, their next effort, Supernature, was an all-out glam disco concoction, meticulous in its detail to the genre's conventions and to Alison's disco-diva costumes. It was also just like old disco albums in one other respect: it was actually a bad album from a purely creative viewpoint, but it was immensely enjoyable. It sold in the millions, spawned threesingle hits, and packed the concert venues across the world.  Seventh Tree was a surprise again, a delightful one. It was a collection of unpretentious and very well written songs that used an overarching acoustic approach, almost folky in places, as if the band (Alison and her synthesizer man, Will Gregory) wanted to assert that simplistic disco aside, they could still produce something memorable and worthy of attention. Not only was the album good musicianship, it allowed Alison to step down from the exhausting podium of disco glamour and be a much simpler character.  In all cases, Goldfrapp had successfully reinvented themselves. With Head First, they take a \\"retro\\" look to their own past -- already? Head First is another dance album, harkening back to Supernature, only this time without the mature, sensual diva; instead, we have cheerleader pop. While it should be the privilege of any artist to present his or her work to the world forever, it's a bit cringeworthy when a forty-four year old (per Wikipedia) avatar of Donna Summer or Gloria Gaynor decides to be a teenager.   Head First is not exactly bad, it's just wholly insipid. Compositionally and lyrically, it has no discernible merit. Even the enjoyment that Supernature provided is much less here. The album seems hurried, as if for some reason they had to produce a hit single really fast, then threw in all manner of filler and called it an album. The first song, Rocket, is already a major single climbing the charts, and with its infectious chorus, it's no wonder. Soon thereafter, though, the music becomes wallpaper and it's hard to focus on it -- there's nothing there, just cutesy noise, the kind that makes you get off of the sofa and feel an urgency to fix the leaky faucet in the kitchen while listening. It just isn't riveting on its own. A description of each song following Rocket would be superfluous, they are all pretty much the same. There is a sneaking dark impression that if this music followed its logical path, it would land squarely in Lady Gaga's territory, minus the vulgarity. The closer, Voicething, is exactly that: a series of processed vocalizations and isolated sounds made with the voice against the usual synth backdrop, not nearly as experimental as it sounds in this description, and absolutely unmemorable. The fact that the album is mercifully short (under 40 minutes) and ends with this non-song, reinforces the feeling that it was patched together really fast for no particular reason. Oh, and you don't really need to know about the lyrics, do you? With poetic jewels such as \\"A Cupid on the go, no arrow and no bow, yeah yeah yeah\\" and \\"I wanna life, I want it now forever, I wanna life, I wanna know, I wanna life, I wanna be together, I wanna life, I wanna know\\" -- surely you don't want to tire your mind with such heavy thoughts.  Considering how talented the duo is, I am happy to wait for their next effort. Until then, I can always listen to Felt Mountain.

The Picture Quality is nice, better than than DVD, but not HD quality of course. The sound dissapointed me and perhaps using DTS-HD would have been better. Dolby TrueHD was not as clear and it can get loud, but not as defined as DTS-HD. Otherwise, a good transfer to have in your collection.
006074748X|5.0|Airs Above The Ground is one of Mary Stewart's best and is well worth reading for several reasons.  Ms. Stewart's heyday was in the 1960s, yet her heroines were all take charge types with careers.  In this book, Vanessa March is a veterinarian though she stopped practicing when she married Lewis.  The plot requires her expertise and it is the reason for the best part of the book, the story of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and its Lippizaner stallions. There is a wealth of fascinating information in this book, though it's well integrated into an exciting story and never reads like a history lesson.  Ms. Stewart's description of the 'airs above the ground' in which the horses perform incredibly difficult dance-like moves in perfect precision to music is worth picking up the book alone, and she makes the horses' performances sound magical--which of course, they are.<br /><br />There's plenty of action in this one; there's a thrilling moonlit chase over and through a castle, a race with a train, and a parrot who says rude things.  There's a circus and a mystery and romance, and horses.  As always, Ms. Stewart writes smart, for educated people.  Each chapter begins with a classical quotation that relates to its contents, and there are plenty of cultural allusions, like when the charming young man Vanessa is escorting to meet his father in Vienna refers to a circus performer as the 'Hungarian Rhapsody'.<br /><br />I've been revisiting a lot of the books I read from when I first ventured out of the children's section of the library. Mary Stewart was one of the first 'grown up' authors I discovered and I devoured every one of her books I could find.  How disappointed I was to find that not every book was as exciting or as well written as Ms. Stewart's and how thrilled I am to find that they are just as wonderful in 2010 as they were in 1970.
0385523386|5.0|Piper Kerman's honest account of her life in prison should be read by anyone who condones the inhumane treatment that so many  of our citizens in jails and holding institutions have to endure.  There are so many ways that none of it makes any sense and she shows how it all  leads to nothing but misery for inmates, jailers and society at large.  America has become a society that abdicates it's own humanity when it condones a system that does nothing to help inmates to  regain their innate right to human dignity.  Our democratic ideals are pure fiction as soon as one enters the world of the incarcerated.  We are neither safer nor saner for treating people the way that Ms. Kerman describes in her memoir.  Read it and weep and laugh and shake your heads, but hats off to Piper and to all the women (and men) who endure under the judicial system's preposterously ugly and mean spirited institutions.    We need more stories like Piper Kerman's to remind us to wake up and stop punishing those we wish to rehabilitate.  The war on drugs and mandatory sentencing reflect our own self loathing and feelings of powerlessness.  Punishment and jail time are the laziest and most debilitating non-solution to our judicial problems as a nation. Wasted lives and dead time are overwhelmingly the result and it's just plain stupid.    This book should be mandatory reading for all those who think that they're different from anyone who is incarcerated.       Thank you Piper and I hope you are well.
1439153663|3.0|This novel is a well written look at race relations in the South during the slavery period.  It held my attention from the beginning.  But I was disappointed by the ending thus I only gave it three stars.  I know that this is listed as a novel and not a romance; however I prefer that the books I read give me some sense of hope of happiness for the main characters.  When this novel ended I was not left with a feeling of a happy future for Lavinia.  What a  shame.  She was such an interesting main character. I would have loved an ending that gave her a bit of happiness and true love. Her entire life as written was difficult and filled with pain.  The ending only offered her years of hard work and loneliness.  I was let down when I finished.

For example, the best scene in part one is when they fight in the air-duct pipe and fall down hanging from the ropes. Part two, they fight in a wooden crate, it falls down and breaks open.   Then they had the dumb corny characters like the guy sunbathing in speedos, just stupid.   They tried to force us to love the characters, e.g. Detective Greenly, he's just annoying, very unlikeable character, when he died the other characters cried to a dramatic effect to make us love the character. It didn't work.   This was obvious when watching the extras, Troy Duffy talks about how he's buddies with the actor that played Greenly, so basically, he adapted the script to please his buddies. It's like he wrote the script with one purpose, to get-together, have fun and reminice over the first movie instead of focusing on a script that takes the second movie to another level. I honestly cannot believe the same writer wrote both movies.   Don't bother buying the movie, rent it watch it once and see what you think.   Troy Duffy you have murdered one of the greatest movies of all time.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Avatar is a great Movie.  Yes, it has elements from many other stories that were told before, but every movie has elements of a story that has been told before, so I don't see this as a negative.  It is absolutely fantastic.  My one star rating is not for the MOVIE, it is for this edition of the BLURAY, as I don't support the double selling tactics of manufacturers.     With that said, this is a review with regard to this BLU-RAY edition, and this blu-ray edition is BAREBONES!!!!!!  I repeat, BAREBONES!!!    No 3D (the way it was meant to be seen), no Behind the scenes specials, and no EXTENDED versions, as what will be released later this year.  If you don't want to wait, and buy this version, you will only encourage the producers to keep releasing films in BAREBONES fashion, and then later again as a Special Edition, instead of just releasing a SPECIAL EDITION with everything now.  I could live without the 3D, but I don't want to buy this movie twice.    I love Avatar, as well as The Lord of the Ring Trilogy, but I will not support BAREBONES versions of Blu-ray Discs, knowing full well that they intend to sell a better version later on.  I fell for this trick when I bought the DVDs, I will no longer fall for it now.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent acting, excellent storyline, excellent dialogue! A true classic.   The Bluray comes with the theatrical and extended version. The extended version is amazing.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I was very pleased with the dvd that I received and with the service at Amazon. Thank you!
B000OPOAJS|4.0|Fantastic movie. Watching the car chase scenes on HD keeps you on the edge of your seats. A must have for Bluray collectors.
B0037AGASG|5.0|Certainly no one will argue that this is \\"great music\\", but it is what it is. He is 16 - his audience is the 8-15 year old female, what can't people get through their heads? If you like punk or grunge or alternative, this is certainly not the CD for you and I would have to question why you have even listened to the CD in the first place in order to review it. Are these people just defensive because they secretly like Justin? I'm a 37 year old mom and all I know is the kid is cute, his music isn't offensive and my two oldest daughters (13 and 11) think he is awesome (posters everywhere). They have really enjoyed this CD and that is where my 5 star rating comes from. I have to admit that even I have walked around at work humming \\"Baby\\". I don't get why there always has to be that group of nay- sayers who want to criticize that which is not to their taste. If you don't like the kid, just don't listen to him.
B00275EGWY|4.0|When we feel everything is under control, we can be a leader, a professional.  But sometimes it's not. At that time we have to find out our believing, our faith and the reason why we have to be, that's the only power source we have. When all of these have gone, we don't have to stick at that. Just let it go.  This is a very good movie, but just like other war movies, full of depression. Watching once is enough for me.
0061914177|1.0|If you want to read a book about how great gary vaynerchuck is - read this book.  According to him, he's totally amazing.  And if you just try to be like him maybe you can be amazing too.  This wine salesman has become a celebrity, according to him, by relentlessly devoting his life to selling selling selling.  Every waking second. And especially by using facebook to sell sell sell.  Maybe if you do the same you can be a celebrity too.
B002E01LL6|3.0|Fighting was the first good Hollywood movie of 2009.  As director Dito Montiel revealed once the movie was in the can, Fighting was originally pitched to him as a street basketball movie.  Dito decided to darken it and make it an underground fighting movie, and amazingly the studio approved it.  Fighting has a familiar plot, familiar twists, and a satisfying ending.  But it is executed very well, has some pretty good fighting scenes, above-average acting (yes, even Tatum is good here), and a slight homage to the New York noirs of the 1970s (think Panic in Needle Park or Dog Day Afternoon).  And to my surprise, women really like this movie.  Not just because of Channing Tatum, but also because of the oddball Terrence Howard, the pacing of the movie, and the not-too-graphic fighting scenes.  Give it a shot.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This release of AVATAR is a complete rip-off and waste of time. James Cameron has already said that this version will be a barebones (movie only) release. He has already said that no earlier than Thanksgiving he will release an ultra version:    *3-D  *All deleted scenes reinserted into the movie, including, supposedly, the sex scene  *Tons of bonus features and extras    He also went on to say that just before this bluray release, he will rerelease this version into the theaters for a limited engagement.    Save you money. Buy the better version when it comes out.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|Wow, it's got everything:    1. Clean, brilliant sound. Excellent engineering. I hate muffled sound and static. This CD delivers great sound.  2. Giles at his best!  3. Beethoven has come back from the grave through Emil and the fidelity of the recording process.    If I were going to spend eternity with only one 9-CD box set, this would be the one.     Bravo!!
B002KSPKRS|1.0|20-30 feet range? Try like 1 foot range. Anything more and you hear loud clicks and pops, which you'll hear anyway. Ever seen that Mr Bean episode where he had to get in those weird poses holding an RF antenna so he can get a signal on his tv? That's what you'll be doing if you want to use these awful things. I can't believe they released this thing. It's absolutely terrible. Nothing but clicks and pops, sometimes you get surround sound, sometimes you don't. The clicks and pops by the way? They ignore your volume setting, get ready to have your ear drums blown out whenever you turn your head slightly or scratch your head (your arm will block the RF signal). I wont be getting my $220 back because I threw these things against the wall out of frustration.     This is one of the worst products I have ever bought in my life.
1400049628|5.0|Bought this after reading World War Z. Max Brooks has his father's gift for humor. This book is an easy read and the author does such a good job of making the subject seem believable, I was actually arguing with some of his conclusions (the AK-47 is not a better choice than an AR-15, the AK-47 has a horrible sight radius and cannot make medium or long range head shots necessarry to take out the zombie horde).    If you like a fun, yet semi serious discussion on how to survive fictional events, this is the book for you.
B0000025T6|4.0|Great work by the boss. I've listened to most of his albums but Nebraska strikes me, while being his most artful, seems to emit frustration and disregard. That said it is one of his best albums. It is truthful and poignant and not without moments of real profundity. If you like pop Bruce, The river, Born to Run, then this album may be chancy. If you are into hearing music that has covertly inspired a lot of artists and an entire genre of music (lo fi) then this is the kind of album you'll enjoy.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I admit I am saving the Crystal Skull for a while, so I can watch it. The other three were a part of an Indy weekend. They are as first rate on DVD as they were before.     Doctor Jones is a kind of character that fits the mold of the adventurer of the films of the thirties and forties. I had seen Raiders when it came out in the theater, and at that time each Saturday on our local PBS station had a program called Matinee at the Bijou, which showed a feature, a serial, and a cartoon, just as they were shown in theaters for a nickel during the thirties. Raiders could have been cut up into scenes and shown as a serial. It has that 'cliff hanging' feel to it. The other films are similar, though I think Raiders still holds the tone of things like Flash Gordon, Superman, and Gene Autry and the gang at Radio Ranch.     I had seen Crystal Skull in the theater the first weekend, but I'm still saving that, perhaps to pair up with Raiders, a sort of Marion then, and Marion later.
B001OQCV6K|3.0|The video quality is some of the best I've seen on Blu-Ray, but seriously? 16x9?  Will we get the original theatrical aspect ratio in a special edition later, WB?  (I can't wait to pay ~$30 for it all over again!)  Maybe you were trying to give me the most pixels for my money, but I don't mind a pair of black bars if it lets me see the whole frame.  Fix this nonsense and try again.  Anyway it's a great movie, it'll be well worth the cash when WB gets its priorities straight.  For now, I feel more than a bit ripped off.    Cinema and videophiles are the ones buying Blu-Rays, and they are paying these premium prices expecting the definitive versions of the films.  When are these companies going to acknowledge this?
B001FB55L2|2.0|This movie simply ran out of steam when it should have been revving it up.  It lost me at the point where Brother Tom kissed the wife, and then went ..... where?  Really seemed like the screenwriters didn't know how to imbue the story with the kind of conflict and emotion it needed.
B001HN694K|5.0|This version of Alice was, indeed, a pleasant take on the whole story that we all know so well.  My wife and I found it to be one of those flicks that stick with you for a few days.  In the deft hands of Tim Burton, the entire experience was delightful and nothing below outstanding.  It was clear that he had full control over all aspects of the filming process.  The acting was superb, and the story was very well-written.  The visual stimulation was enough on its own without the story.  Great job and thumbs up all around!!!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Wow ! What a deal Four discs for the same price as one. Great movie too by the way
B0026RHR6K|5.0|This TV show is amazing to say the least.  Gripping plot and suspenseful cliffhangers will definitely get you glued to the screen hours on end.  The first SciFi work that in my opinion feels \\"real\\".  highly recommended to watch.  However, as almost everyone here, I also find the packaging a bit mediocre.  However, the Cylon figurine rocks!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of my favorite books. I have read it many times in print form. The dialogue between the characters is fabulous. The exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are spicy and clever. The book really illustrates the class issues of England at the time. It really sheds a harsh light on the opportunities or lack thereof for women. Even Jane Austen's personal story is a classic one for that time. Now I have it in the kindle format and can carry it with me wherever I go.
B002VECLVY|5.0|So much has been written of A Single Man.<br /><br />The film is brilliant, as a directorial debut for Tom Ford and a star acting vehicle for Colin Firth.<br /><br />Tom Ford found his niche for A Single Man can almost qualify for a non-mainstream art house movie with its splendid shots, flashbacks and occasionally black-and-white retellings. Notwithstanding the fact that there were several model-quality actors in a few scenes, the casting was impeccable, Colin Firth as the emotionally-wrecked George Falconer putting on a false front living his day mourning for his dead lover; a vulnerable and empty Julianne Moore as Charly and Nicholas Hoult as a seemingly precocious youth tempting his professor.<br /><br />The screen adaptation was well-written. The book, as I have read it, was ponderous at times. It would have been a great challenge to move it to screen since much of the film relied on the strength of its cast and in this case, the marriage of screenplay and acting prowess was sweet. The film depended mostly on Colin Firth, his facial expressions, sometimes almost stoic, still betrayed a sense of neediness, something his young student picked up almost readily. His long-time best pal, once ex-lover, Charly, is a middle-aged woman who's bent on refusing to pick up the pieces of a broken marriage and a grown-up child, choosing to wallow in self-pity while still somewhat pining for the lost love she had with George. In that, Julianne Moore's screen time brings out the best performance in Firth. For that, Julianne Moore is no longer acting. She just is Charly (see her in a 10-min turn in The Secret Life of Pippa Lee). And I will certainly say that she is as good as my other favourite, Meryl Streep.<br /><br />The dialog is memorable and gripping. Jim said while on the couch chilling with George, \\"If I die now, I'd be happy.\\" How many of us think of such simple pleasures in life, just being next to the person we love? I think.<br /><br />The film is ultimately all about living a life of love, loss and hope.<br /><br />\\"The few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh. I can never make these moments last. I cling to them, but like everything, they fade. I have lived my life on these moments. They pull me back to the present, and I realize that everything is exactly the way it was meant to be. \\"\\"The few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh.

B002QW7ALM|2.0|This movie sucked it was really hard to follow what was going on at times and I am still confused. It starts off on a space craft head to Tilha a new planet carrying lots of people but something has went terribly wrong and people began waking up in a nightmare.One astronaunt wakes up and has lost of memory and is disoriented after coming to on board the space craft. Soon another person awakes and they try and figure out whats going on and what has happened to all the crew and people aboard the craft. When they finally realize whats happening on board the craft and whats on board with them the movie starts to get really creepy. The creatures look a lot like the creatures in (The Descent) 2005 one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately this move did not make it.
B002S0OBN2|2.0|The score to Andrew Lloyd Webber's newest musical LOVE NEVER DIES is a Major Disappointment.  It is bland and repetitive.  We have heard the majority of the music before from his other scores.  The lyrics by Glenn Slater are amaturish at best. I found it quite difficult to get through the first act. The rock or electric sound that ends the first act, which did that come from.  It is so out of place, I think they added that to keep us awake.  When I returned to the second act, just lets say I wish I didn't.   But, there is hope at the end of this awful disappointing score, that the majority of the music heard in ths album is no longer in the show.  The show went through a lot of reworking and rewriting after this fiasco.  But, from my friends, who have this show, say it's not much better.  If Andrew Lloyd Webber had been writing in the 50's and 60's, he could have been one of the greatest scoring writers Hollywood has ever seen or heard.    LOVE NEVER DIES the latest from Andrew Lloyd Webber  2 stars thats' being kind after the some of the fine scores he has written.
0552998087|5.0|Unless you're one of those truely pathetic types who cannot stomach ANY criticism of America and Americans, you'll love 'The Lost Continent'. It is probably Bill Bryson's finest work, which is really saying something, since he is one of the finest writers around today.    And fair's fair: We thoroughly enjoyed reading Bryson's hysterically ascerbic and witty comments about Europe, Europeans and other people and places, so we ought to love it when he gives us the very same treatment, and the fact is he does it so much better than anybody else!    *** SPOILER ALERT ***    But here's a tip for you sad types who would call French Fries \\"Freedom Fries\\": At the end of 'The Lost Continent', in the last few pages -- the ones you didn't see because you had a tantrum and threw the book down after only making it to around page 7 -- Bryson recants, and expresses his undying admiration and love for America and Americans.
B0011FTQ4O|3.0|REVIEW OF THE UK BLU-RAY IMPORT -- \\"Almost Famous\\" is a terrific movie that plays almost like a fan's love-letter to Rock N'Roll - this and \\"High Fidelity\\" are probably two of the best films that will remind you of why you love rock music so much (and both rank in my personal favorites for both films of the last 10 years or so, as well as rock n roll films).  I'll assume that if you've searched for \\"Almost Famous\\"'s Blu-Ray version, you're probably already familiar with the movie (and like me, might be looking to upgrade), so i'll cut to the chase on the Blu-Ray version:  Overall, it's a good transfer, though i don't know that i'd say it's a spectacular transfer to the point of being revelatory in the visual sense.  The version of the film presented here is the 'Untitled' cut, which runs around 2 hours 40 min or so, and sound quality is very good.  This pressing is actually a UK pressing, though (as i learned) there doesn't seem to be regional-coding protections on Blu-Ray (as there are on DVD's) and this disc played fine in my US machine (no artifacts, etc).  There are very few extras: only a 2 minute Lester Bangs interview plus around 10 min of table readings/set rehearsal footage.  So if you popped for the 2 DVD/1CD \\"Almost Famous\\" so-called 'bootleg' edition, i'd recommend hanging onto that set (which is now out of print, i believe), if only for the extras, the audio CD, etc.  Overall, i guess i'm happy to have it on Blu-Ray, though the skimpy extras and the almost-negligible improvement in picture quality somewhat temper my satisfaction with this purchase.
1401307450|5.0|I had this book recommended to me by some friends, and was pleasantly surprised when I read it.  Not only could I not put it down (neither in the airport nor the beaches of Costa Rica), but I fell in love with Anthony Kiedis.  I'm not one to obsess over celebrities, but Kiedis' words are heartbreakingly relatable and exciting.  This is great for boys, girls, adults, and teenagers.  It leaves a lasting impression and of course glorifies the great state of California.  By far my favorite book!!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|loved the movie and bought it promptly. Sceneries  beautiful and very interesting! The personal relationships are fun and great to watch. My grandchildren and \\"children\\" loved it and we all were fascinated by the movie.
B0000013GT|5.0|This is a must have for the true hip hop fan! It is not watered down radio-ready crap! It is the real deal...the best of the best from the golden age of hip hop!
0143113100|5.0|This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read and surely the most accessible neuroscience book on the shelves that I have yet encountered. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities for people who have suffered brain injuries or who have learning disabilities or psychiatric illnesses. I have been using the principles of neural pathway creation for new behaviors for several years now with counseling clients, and it is just further proof that this is only about 10% of the potential for change that exists in the field of psychology. The book is a triumph!
0307463745|5.0|Fast read with a lot of great tips and food for thought. Would recommend to anyone interested in working more efficiently.
0517223546|4.0|Being a fan of sagas written in a \\"Michener-esque\\" style, I found this book to be a very entertaining, pleasurable read.  It appeared to be well researched for the historical landscape of the region around Winchester, England.<br /><br />However, it also appeared that the author may have been wanting to end the novel rather quickly once the story had progressed to the  16th century, after which the story raced rather abruptly to World War II.  The presence of such a gap was somewhat disappointing for a book that I otherwise could very easily given top marks.
0385504225|2.0|I hate when authors stop writing novels and start writing 'direct to movie, here's the screenplay' BAH. Brown has unfortunately done this with The Lost Symbol. His previous works were good reads but this one is purely lazy writing, knowing that it's going to be made into a movie. If you were to take out the blank spaces at the end and at the beginning of each chapter, the book would shrink to half its size. This is one of the measures I use when determining quality writing. More blank space = lower quality. I found the writing to be plain, boring and utterly predicable. At least in his other novels, I actually felt like I learned a bit of history. This one? No. As I was reading it, I felt like Brown could have gone FARTHER explaining almost everything in this book, but instead, just glossed over points to make it \\"easier\\" to understand. I liked the complexity of his other novels, I liked the history. The Lost Symbol was a watered down version of what could have been an excellent book. I was very disappointed.
0393072231|5.0|A book about finance so craftily written that I stayed up late to read it, spellbound.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Fast delivery...item received just as described. Purchased this CD to review for my grand daughter. Most songs are OK for 8-10 yr. olds (I enjoy them too, as they remind me of how I felt as a young girl in school).
B001OQCV6K|5.0|With pure curiosity I read the reviews with one star. I wondered how this movie would get just one star. My parents have been long fans of Sherlock Holmes so it is a character I grew up with. My Father was big in to the original Literary novels and my Mother loved the Jeremy Brett television version. I have seen that and the Basil Rathbone version and I loved this. The literary Character was troubled with a drug addiction and still was able to use such an amazing mind to figure out the most minute details. I feel that this movie gave a fair representation of the character even though there are several who will disagree. Robert Downey Jr's Sherlock is more into the drugs than Sir Conan Doyle's but it still leaves you in awe that a Character so blitzed out of his mind has the most impressive deductive reasoning.     The movie was in my opinion very well written and the Plot was one that pulls you in form the beginning and doesn't let go till the very end. The ending even left it open for a sequel that I can't wait for and I have heard nothing to the sort that they are even going to do a sequel. Some may disagree with this statement and to each his own, but I was happy to see a more literary Sherlock Holmes when I was expecting a more modern action hero from what the previews led on. That being said the fight scenes are a bit comical at times but a bit of light hearted humor is always welcome in such a serious setting. What interested me in these scenes was that you get to watch it play out in Holmes' head and he will voice over the reason for his choice of attacks. He even explains the duration of recovery time the attack will take.     To anyone who has enjoyed Sherlock Holmes I recommend this movie and to those who have not heard of the character or know little about him, this is a great opportunity to be introduced to some of the best Literature ever. If seeing this movie gets some one to pick up a book it has more that done its job.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Haven't Met You Yet is a wonderfully fresh sounding tune! I'd love more of that from him!!
B002ZFQD04|5.0|They have been with Madonna since the Whos That Girl tour.  I started noticing them since the Truth or Dare movie and they are wonderful-they appear in several of her videos, sing backup and dance with her.  I like when you see Madonna being faithful to the dancers and singers.  There were 3 or 4 from the Confessions tour on this tour all of them men.<br /><br />It is always disappointing to see other concerts when Madoona puts on such a great show. And this is no exception.  I did not think anything could outdo the Confessions tour but this did.<br /><br />It is nice seeing her doing some slow music also-Dont Cry For Me Argentina/You Must Love Me-they were fabulous!  I wish she would perform Take A Bow/You'll See live.<br /><br />I liked that she communicated with the crowd more than any of her other concerts.  I wonder if the guy she picked from the audience to chose a song was a plant and she knew what song he was going to say?<br /><br />Doesnt matter it was excellent-great to workout to.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|I love the classic sound of George Strait, Alan Jackson. This guy is like Brad Paisley and Joe Nichols, too. Great stuff!!
B00275EGWY|1.0|Although I don't usually review movies on Amazon, this one was so monotonous, I just had to warn others. It was 131 minutes long, but I felt like I watched the same 10 minutes over and over again 13 times.

0143038583|5.0|This book is about where your food comes from. It is the personal search by the author to trace the origins of everything he eats. But this is a personal search that evolves into a vision of how everthing is connected to everything else, and how ultimately food is one pathway into our relationship to all of life and the nature of our planet. It is this extraordinary skill of going from the particulars of one person's romance with food, to the generalities of our behavior in relationship to everything else, that makes this book so informative. In this respect, the book is about the ethical nature of behavior that derives from seeing the connections at a higher level than one's individual daily rituals of eating. This is an insightful, compelling, and informative narrative of the highest order, factual, but skillfully written and as readable as a fine novel.
B001KR0BDI|5.0|i was not dissapointed in any aspect with this book.  it was funny entertaining, exciting and romantic all at the same tme.  three cheers for Katsa and Po!
B00275EGWY|4.0|When it comes to war movies, alot of the good ones are about WWII and Vietnam. \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is the first good war movie that is about \\"The War on Terror\\".     \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is about bomb squad unit that deals with roadside bombs, car bombs, ect. This is a very realistic, because as we all know, the suicided bombings are a big issue for the war.    \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is a very realistic and entertaining film. Also, you don't have to be a huge war movie fan to enjoy this film.
B0026WNGBA|1.0|This review is for the sample only.  The sample for kindle eddition only gives you a bunch of reviews and the table of content.  One can NOT decide if the writers style or apporach is any good from this.  It is more like getting a sales letter instead of a sample.  I for one will Not waste my money without being able to review some of the actual book which MAY actually be good or even great but how could we tell?
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I listen only to jazz and did my dull-diligence and found this is probably the best pair of jazz headphones you can get.  I'm actually kinda happy it's also one of the most affordable high-end headphones out there.  I might try Grado one day just to compare because I hear really good stuff about them as well and they might sound clearer and maybe even Sennheiser?  But these seem to be the top 3 brands.  The problem with these headphones is they sound too good.  When I go out and listen with my buds or portable headphones, it becomes a really bad experience :(  Basically, you become too spoiled by these guys.  I listen to my mp3 player at home with these and they sound just as great.  No amp really required but may help.  You could probably wear these outside but they are big.  Frankly, I keep mine in its original box at home until I want to use them - they're my babies.  I highly recommend this over 701 because 1) color is more classic 2) detachable cord makes sense - if you tug it and it breaks, you can replace just the cord instead of entire headphones!
B002436WJE|5.0|Taken is a movie that takes no prisoners -- yes there are holes in the plot, yes some of it is predictable, yes it is not very deep.  But this movie doesn't pretend to be any of those things.  The charisma of this film lies in it's willingness to be a bit over the top and keep the suspense ratcheted up.  That's it.  And this movie does that.  Liam Neeson plays a terrific role in this film.  5 stars was an easy decision for me quite simply because I really enjoyed watching it.  Side note to those who buy the \\"2-disc extended edition\\":  the second disc is merely a digital copy of the movie.  It doesn't contain any extras from the first disc.  The 2-disc set is a ripoff for that reason, but I didn't want that piece of shady advertising to detract from my review of the movie itself.
B000059GEH|5.0|I think its one of the better Monroe films though she isnt the main character.  Great story with a cute plot.  Definitely a movie to grab if you want to watch the one of the better old comedies.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Just a heads up, this version has IMAX sequences that are filmed (or edited) at a different aspect ratio. So watching on a 16:9 (widescreen) TV, sometimes there's bars on the top and bottom of the movie, and sometimes the movie fills the whole screen. It's definitely a little weird. And it switches back and forth during a scene change. Some may not notice it, and I didn't get too distracted, but it was a little odd and I could see some people getting annoyed with it.  I'm not sure if the one you'd buy at the store would be the same or not.

B0035V35P8|5.0|Just got through watching this. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Reminds me of the Canon Ninja flicks that dominated much of the '80s! As did one man in particular, the great Sho Kosugi! Unfortunately, time has not been very kind to him, but he still has the moves!<br />If you love Ninja flicks &/or Sho Kosugi, get this. Yes, I know Rain is the feature star, but he is not Sho Kosugi!!!<br />The dvd contains a bunch of trailers which can be only viewed when you load the disc initially. Did not really care for the Nightmare on Elm Street Trailer though!<br />Also, there are deleted scenes. It is truly unfortunate that we did not get any of the features that are exclusively on the Bluray!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|\\"Moon\\" was directed by Duncan Jones based on his original story with screenwriter Nathan Parker. It stars Sam Rockwell as astronaut Sam Bell who is near the end of a three year stint as the sole employee on a lunar base on the moon gathering a clean energy resource that helps Earth's fuel problems. With only the company of a robot GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey, Sam's loneliness has gotten to him and he begins to hallucinate.<br /><br />This movie rests almost entirely on Sam Rockwell and boils down to a one-man show. His character is isolated in this moon base and after a discovery, he begins to doubt everything he has believed to be true in his time there. He plays multiple versions of himself overtime with and without facial hair and injuries and somehow keeps it all straight.<br /><br />Rockwell's performance as Sam Bell is masterfully done in a way that few people could ever accomplish. I am in shock that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this film. It is a true test to his power of endurance, skill, nuance, subtlety, and raw emotion and he carries it through with flying colors. Bell's biggest goal is just to get back to his infant daughter and his wife whom he left back on Earth. With two weeks to go, every event seems blown up in scale to hindering his return. Their presence is always in the back of his mind and he is often reviewing time delayed tapes sent from his wife and dreams about her as extra motivation to persevere.<br /><br />This story feels like a blend of the claustrophobia and psychological mind games found in \\"Sphere\\" (especially with the added element of Kevin Spacey's voice) with the extra isolation of space like in many movies like \\"Apollo 13\\" and even \\"Alien\\".<br /><br />Kevin Spacey's GERTY has a smiley face icon on one of its panels that changes expression to try and interact with and take care of Sam Bell. It walks the fine line between being suspiciously enigmatic and occasionally sweet as Sam's company. Spacey's dry, comforting, and emotionally even tone really builds suspense as the audience tries to figure out what the robot's true agenda might be.<br /><br />Visually, the moon looks amazing, almost as if it could have been shot on location. The design of the stations and vehicles seems very realistic. This science fiction is a well-thought out puzzle that unfolds slowly over time. It has an older feel with the pacing and themes and as always, sometimes technology can get the better of us. The transitions are seamless and the story amazingly well told and engaging. Some of it is heartwarming, some is disturbing, but all the ups and downs are worth it. I really can't go into it any further without giving away major spoilers suffice to say this is one of the BEST movies of 2009 by far and I am so glad I finally got to see it.

0525421580|5.0|When I heard that John Green and David Levithan, arguably two of the most defined voices in today's young adult literature generation, were teaming up to write a novel, I knew the product would be memorable, but I surely wasn't ready for the story they were presenting.     WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRASYON is ostensibly about love and friendship. It's about accepting what you're given and breaking those boundaries you set up to keep others out. It's about following your heart and letting yourself fall, without fearing the landing.     The book was written in an interesting way. About two characters named Will Grayson (one straight, one gay), their stories are told separately in alternating chapters until, by miracle or fate, they finally meet.     Will Grayon #1 (numbers for ease of understanding in this review), written by Green, has two simple rules: 1. Don't' care too much, 2. Shut up. These rules have seemingly gotten him through life unscarred. He doesn't accept girlfriends, in fear of hurt and blends in behind his best friend. Will Grayson #2, written by Levithan, is in a perpetual state of depression, due in part to his family's situation (his father left, and his mother can barely afford dinner, causing him to pick up a weekend job), and in part to his blossoming sexuality (wherein, he learns that he prefers guys by becoming friends with one online).     In the center lies Tiny Cooper (who I love and want to be friends with), WG1's best friend, who, as Green puts it, isn't the world's gayest person, nor the world's largest person, but surely the world's gayest large person, or largest gay person. Through raw determination, passion, and, yes, song and dance sometimes, he helps both Graysons realize who they are, and what, ultimately, they need to overcome.     During one cold night in the midst of Chicago, the two teenage Graysons meet, unplanned and unpredicted. Through this chance crossing of paths, they find themselves watching their lives go in new and unexpected directions, all culminating with ultimate realizations and the history's most fabulous musical ever.     Both Green and Levithan do an incredibly job at giving their respective Will Grayson a voice. Observant and an over-thinker, Green's Grayson is the confused high school student just trying to get by unseen. Similarly, Levithan's Grayson is also trying to get by unnoticed, but as he does this, he creates this inner monologue devoid of happiness in order to illustrate his feelings. Both liars in their own sense, both refuse to listen to what they want and, ultimately, need. Both characters are extremely likable, regardless of their flaws and times you want to slap sense into them, - to the point of wanting them as friends of your own. They feel real and, in a way, raw.     In the heart of the story is acceptance. As Tiny plans his ultimate high school musical, he lets both characters in on a little secret: you're only as insecure as you let on. The book shows that it's okay to be gay, or fat, or ugly, or a dork. It's okay to be who you are, because people will eventually like you for it, or regardless of it. And it's this powerful message that shines through far after the last page is turned. Through Tiny, readers see that everything will be okay.     Gripping, powerful, and overwhelmingly heartfelt, WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON shows the reader that it's okay to be who you are, even if that person is incredibly large, incredibly gay, and always full of song.
B000UPGQQW|3.0|Since I was four years old when it came out in 1987, I had never seen \\"The Lost Boys\\" till now. It was directed by Joel Schumacher who would later direct \\"Batman Forever\\", \\"Batman & Robin\\", \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", and John Grisham stories \\"A Time to Kill\\" and \\"The Client\\" among others. To say this man has had a varied career would be an understatement. This was one of his earliest directing projects and it has scores of 80s camp and vampire cliches freaky enough to make the Cullen vamps from \\"Twilight\\" shake in their boots and lose their sparkle. A mother and her two sons move to a beach vacation town with the country's highest murder rate. One of the sons, Michael befriends a rowdy gang out of interest for a girl and his life will never be the same.<br /><br />Michael, played by Jason Patric, is a moody teen upset with the move but like in all beach towns, he sees a pretty girl and is instantly smitten and ready to do anything to impress her. Anything including riding off into the night with her and a scary gang of guys who issue him dares and trick him into drinking wine laced with blood. His brother, Sam played by Corey Haim is suspicious of Michael's new strange behaviors especially since he has been brought up to date on what this town is all about by the Frog brothers at the local comic book store played by Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander.<br /><br />Surprise, surprise, they are a bunch of vampires with Kiefer Sutherland at the helm as David. Kiefer looks majorly young still fourteen years away from becoming Jack Bauer but the grittiness in his voice never changes just like his powers of intimidation. I think Michael should be thankful that he got off so easy because Kiefer could have just beheaded him Bauer-style from the beginning! Easily the best part of the film, Kiefer is ultra creepy especially when his voice keeps whispering \\"Michael....Michael....\\"<br /><br />There are fun flying stunts and crazy vamp eyes. This movie goes old-school with vamps hanging upside down like bats. It has all the old school 80s spirit of kids taking matters into their own hands like \\"The Goonies\\" by trying to bring down the whole vampire clan in hopes of saving Michael and his new girlfriend, Star played by Jami Gertz.<br /><br />I enjoyed feeling the classic flavor and the old school vampire vibe, but all together, I didn't like it that much, it was just ok. I think this is one of those classics that gains power and popularity over time, especially if you were of the original generation that viewed it but I don't have any plans to watch it again any time soon unless it's Halloween.ts.

0060751967|3.0|I want to say that you should not judge a book by it's cover.  I am guilty of this one.  But lets face it, the cover is the first thing you see, if you like the front, you look to the back, and then if it passes your inspection, you bring it home.  It obviously passed for me.  It's a quick read.  It's not entirely unpleasant, in fact, the bones of the story are quite good.  It's just that the writing is so dry.  I have read many vampire romance novels, and if you compare it to the whole, it will fall flat.  If you don't compare it to anything, I would probable like it more.  So as long as you're not a big vampire romance fan, I would buy it, and enjoy it.  I would think twice before buying this one if you're a big fan of the genre.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1CZWPSJUYQTG6]]The remake of the 1981 classic, \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was directed by Louis Leterrier, director of \\"Transporter 2\\" and \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" (the Edward Norton one). It stars Sam Worthington as Perseus, son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) whose entire human family has been killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and with the help of Io (Gemma Arterton) he is seeking his revenge and attempting to save Argos and the Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalvos).<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition is the best way to experience this epic movie heavily based in green screen CGI technology. The most amazing aspect is a feature I've never seen before but think should be in ALL Blu-Ray movies is the Maximum Movie Mode which is a complex picture-in-picture way of watching the film where it will zoom out from the movie itself and put it aside where you can still see it while bringing up another box with scene breakdowns, effects breakdowns, and on-the-spot vignettes all the while you are watching the movie! For example, in one of the beginning scenes you are watching Perseus and his father talking on the fishing boat and at the same time you can see how the boat was built, complications the crew faced in getting it to work, and other behind the scenes moments.<br /><br />Many of my main complaints about the film are recognized in deleted scenes and the alternate ending. For example, I disliked how after all the set-up for Perseus not wanting the gods help that he just got this easy going peace with Zeus at the end. The alternate ending was preferable for me because Perseus goes all the way up to Mount Olympus on his Pegasus to face Zeus in a manly way shrugging him off once and for all. My biggest problem with the movie was that we only focused on two of the gods: Zeus and Hades while all the others stood around and never got to talk. In the deleted scenes, you will find much more character development and dialogue from all the other gods getting involved, having opinions on Zeus's actions, and even one going down to Earth to talk to Perseus and give him the gold coin. At some point in the process, a decision was made to go in the other direction but I think the original idea of having all the others involved was a stronger choice. Another nice thing about getting to see these deleted scenes that aren't completely up to par with the special effects is that you get a chance to admire the shiny, metallic costumes the gods wear that you can barely see with all the glowy effects bling added post production during the film.<br /><br />Another feature praises Sam Worthington as being an \\"action hero for the ages\\" mainly highlighting his willingness to do his own stunt work as much as possible. There are many small featurettes on individual aspects of production, but the best way to get that full experience I think is to watch that Maximum Movie Mode which is very thorough and if there's a boring moment, you have the option of going back to watching the movie and ignoring it.

B002VECM4A|5.0|Gabourey Sidibe was robbed of the Oscar. I finally got to watch this movie and I have to say while I liked Meryl Streep in \\"Julie and Julia\\" and Sandra Bullock in \\"The Blind Side\\", neither role was as challenging or over such an emotional range as the load of this role of Precious was for this young actress and she handled it amazingly well.<br /><br />\\"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire\\" was directed by Lee Daniels and stars Gabourey Sidibe as Precious, a young illiterate, overweight teen living in Harlem who is pregnant with her second child by her father and has been kicked out of school. She is given a second chance at life in an alternative school to work towards earning her G.E.D. It was no shock at all to see Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry as producers on this film.<br /><br />Precious is doomed from the start by Mary played by Mo'Nique in the role that won her an Academy Award this year. This mother is so selfish that she can't even protect her daughter from being sexually abused and as she grows older, Mary grows jealous and resentful of Precious and abuses her physically and emotionally. Mo'Nique's Mary is frightening and shocking and in many sad ways, pathetic. Mo'Nique and Gabourey both ran the gauntlet of emotions in their roles and probably both should have won Academy Awards.<br /><br />Gabourey Sidibe's Precious deals with serious hardships beyond what any person should ever have to face every single day between being mistreated by classmates, kids on the street, and her own family. Her weight issues result from a combination of starving when they don't have money to buy food and being forced to eat as punishment by Mary when she is told she doesn't cook the food right. Mary's complete dependence on her daughter and treatment of her as property creates a hold over Precious that is very difficult to break, especially when Precious wants to imagine Mary as a more caring mother in her dream world. What is most amazing to me with all the burdens of Precious' life with her education, her children, and her health is that she gets though the movie without ever giving up completely. She works really hard to learn to read and improve her situation and break out of the cycle of abuse. She goes through anger, bawling her eyes out despair, and the happiness that comes with having hope.<br /><br />The teacher at the alternative school, Ms. Rain is played by Paula Patton. She is beautiful and handles the burden of helping these kids with grace and realism not often seen in typical movies about helping underprivileged kids. She genuinely cares and tries to connect without letting them walk all over her. This part of the story I've seen a ton of times with a teacher helping underprivileged kids but this is the best version I've seen since it didn't fall into cliches the way they usually do so easily. Mariah Carey takes on the best role I've ever seen from her by letting herself be completely real in appearance as a welfare worker, Mrs. Weiss. That kind of honesty combined with such a genuine performance really helped bring this movie together.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the directing style and editing on this film. Precious often jumps into a fantasy of modeling or performing when she is in a difficult situation she wants to escape. I loved the way the film styles of glamor, photoshop, still images, and sparkle were split with gritty, dark, fluorescent lit reality.<br /><br />Everything that could go wrong pretty much went wrong in this character's life so keep in mind when you consider watching this film that it is HEAVY in drama and sadness and a bad situation that keeps seeming to get worse. If you have a lot of trouble watching really down, depressing movies, you'll want to avoid this, but if you like crazy emotional rides than this is for you.<br /><br />This story is often sad, shocking, depressing, uplifting, and always....precious.her education, her children, and her health is that she gets though the movie without ever giving up completely.

B002NXSRVG|4.0|I had LOW expectations for this movie. i did ask for and got it for christmas 2009 and waited until today to watch it because i didn' want to be disapointed.<br /><br />I WASN'T<br /><br />The movie got right into the action. even though it was mostly CGI i didn't care. this was a faily decent movie with a decent plot. could this happen for real? hell no. A terrorist making a dooms day bomb and then going to the UN to ask for more funding? laughable....but it got better from there.<br /><br />Compare this to other 80's cartoons that became live action movies (transformers comes to mind) this should have won an acadamy award. (no i am not saying it really should have, i am saying it was better.<br /><br />if you watched and liked the GI Joe cartoons this will fill an emprty spot. If action and shoot em ups are not your thing, stay away, there is plent \\"speghetti sauce\\" to go around here
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|1 Disc Widescreen Edition (2007)<br /><br />The original \\"Death at a Funeral\\" was directed by Frank Oz and written by Dean Craig. This story has the feel of a great play where an ensemble cast of ridiculous Brits try to make the best of a bad situation at their patriarch's funeral when many things go awry and a midget attempts to blackmail them.<br /><br />This is a zany farce for certain. There are many familiar British faces and the situations just go from bad to worse and from worse to horrifyingly funny. A comedy of manners combined with pure slapstick in a funeral that seems unable to be completed between fighting and public nudity and mixed up corpses. There's a great build in exposition in the first act, an increase in action in the second, and then all out looney by the third with nice closure. It really reminds me of a great ensemble farce play like \\"Noises Off\\" that was made into a movie in 1992 featuring Michael Caine, Carol Burnett, and Christopher Reeve (but I recommend seeing that live if you can because it's a lot funnier that way).<br /><br />The best stand-out performance is by Alan Tudyk whom you might remember as the pirate in \\"Dodgeball\\" and he plays Simon. His English accent is wonderful, so convincing that I didn't know he was actually American till I listened to the commentary. His character is trying really hard to impress his girlfriend's father and is so nervous going to this funeral that he takes Valium to calm down.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is not Valium but a hallucinogenic drug and he spends the entire day getting progressively more spaced out and behaving ridiculously until he ends up naked on the roof! His facial expressions are so well done that you can almost imagine what his character is seeing when he is staring at the widow's hat. He does lots of great little bits ranging from subtle to very intense and it sells the situation really well.<br /><br />Matthew Macfadyen plays Daniel, the responsible brother who stayed home and took care of their father before he passed. He is trying so hard to stay respectful and calm throughout the day and it's a big chore to be one of the few straight characters amongst a bunch of looneys including Peter Dinklage, the dwarf attempting to blackmail the family and Andy Nyman, an insecure hypochondriac care taking for Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan) while general screwing things up for the others with pettiness.<br /><br />It also has one of the English fellows from \\"Love Actually\\" Kris Marshall so a friend and I kept quoting back and forth whenever he came onscreen, \\"You do not have a cute British accent!\\" \\"Yes I DO!\\" There are many great characters and performances, but it's really the group working together that makes it work so well. A pure delight with lots of laughs and a bit of heart and I highly recommend seeing it BEFORE the remake version because from what I've seen of the trailer, they are using the same jokes almost word for word with an urban flair and if it doesn't work out well, I'd rather you see this one to begin with.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />There is audio commentary with director Frank Oz. The director alone speaks a lot about how it was difficult to even out the weather over different scenes and how the indoor shoot and outdoor shoot were an hour away so someone running indoors really did the second part of the scene five weeks later. It is a love fest about the actors, but he really focuses on the talent of Peter Dinklage and his deliberate choice to only mention his height in dialogue once. It's a bit stiff but if you enjoy hearing about how many cameras were used in certain shots and why and how an actress' pregnancy was covered up, then by all means listen.<br /><br />There is also audio commentary with screenwriter Dean Craig and actors Alan Tudyk who played Simon and Andy Nyman who played Howard. Of the two commentaries, this is the more entertaining, mostly because it's a group of people chattering back and forth, two of whom are funny actors and the other being the source of the funny material for the film. Alan is American and talks about the joys of learning to drive sitting on the right side on the other side of the road. There is a lot of talk about how certain jokes came about and what was written and what was improvised on the day.<br /><br />He mentions one scene where he actually was high because he was experimenting for research for the role and didn't know he would be filming on that day. The difficulties of making it through certain scenes with a straight face and unconscious hand movements are explored in more depth and it's a pretty fun listen. It is also verified that yes, Alan was completely and utterly naked for the shoot and actually grew accustomed to it and bored after a while.<br /><br />The gag reel is very funny, lots of line flubs and inability to keep the crazy grin on or talk about the parking space without laughing. You get to see extended takes of Alan Tudyk's performance of being drugged out which are very funny as well. As with all gag reels, it clearly demonstrates how much fun the movie was to make and as a result, makes you feel included in the fun.for the film.

1416550550|5.0|After reading Kate Morton's debut novel, The House at Riverton, I knew I had to read The Forgotten Garden. I was not disappointed! The author has such a way of allowing you to connect with the characters that you truly feel like you know them. As with her first novel, it does get off to a slow start. This is what makes the ending so satisfying. You are given time to bond with the characters, to know what has led them on this journey & as the story progresses everything you have been waiting for starts to happen. The result is a hammering heart, gasps of surprise & an emotional and incredible ending. I don't usually get emotional when reading a book but with both of Kate Morton's I had tears in my eyes at the end. I will read every book that is published by this author! Can't wait for the next one!!
B002ONC9NC|5.0|This movie was one of the best stories I've seen in a movie in a while. \\"An Education\\" was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars this year and was directed by Lone Scherfig based on a memoir by Lynn Barber and adapted for the screen by writer, Nick Hornby who wrote \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About a Boy\\". Hornby's story-telling skills are tip-top and it showed here in this coming-of-age story of a young woman in the 1960s trying to get into Oxford University when her life changes with the distraction of an older man and his free-spirited life of concerts, art, and trips to Paris.<br /><br />Carey Mulligan was nominated for Best Actress for her role as Jenny and she deserves it. She has all the charm and energy of a young Audrey Hepburn and even styles her hair like her. (Coincidentally, I just noticed on IMDB that Mulligan is slated to be Eliza Doolittle in a remake of \\"My Fair Lady\\" for 2012!) Mulligan is so easy to empathize with as Jenny and really wears her heart on her sleeve. It reminds me in some ways of another story, \\"Sabrina\\" which the older version ALSO had Audrey Hepburn. She seems to embody that youthful spirit with a depth of maturity that is just a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Besides looks, Jenny is fiercely clever and curious about all manner of things French and is eager to learn anything she can about the lifestyle. Jenny's upbringing by her parents played by Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour stresses the importance of study and a good education, hence her goal of Oxford.<br /><br />But women are not taken seriously in this time and even if you study, you might end up as a teacher or in some public service role. Schooling is just another venue to finding an ideal mate to support you the rest of your life. The very idea is frustrating to Jenny when she is so intensely intelligent, but even her women's liberation attitude can be swept away by Peter Sarsgaard's charm.<br /><br />David played by Peter Sarsgaard is something of a playboy who plays very hard all the time and sweeps Jenny into his world of exciting auctions, racetracks, and clubs. David has a way with words and delivery that seems to make everyone including Jenny's parents eat out of the palm of his hand.<br /><br />David's clever words do not last forever as Jenny starts to uncover some secrets about him he was not forthcoming with. Sarsgaard's English accent is deceptively good for someone born in Illinois. It has a very light touch so that it is harder to catch any flubs but seems quiet natural. At first the age difference seems a bit creepy but what wins the audience over into belief is not Sarsgaard's performance by Mulligan's commitment to the mutual attraction.<br /><br />David hangs out with another couple - Danny and Helen played by Dominic Cooper and Rosamund Pike. Rosamund Pike is delightful as the opposite of everything Jenny is but the foreshadowing of everything she could become if she changed her path. Helen is a ditzy-type mainly in the group for her attractiveness but prone to making flighty statements like, \\"No one will be speaking Latin in five years, not even Latin people.\\" She makes it completely believable that someone could be content with their low level of knowledge and just play and be arm candy. Her example is the only way for Jenny's character to really make comparisons and decisions about whom she wants to be.<br /><br />I also have to mention the lovely Emma Thompson whom I adore made an appearance as a strict head mistress of Jenny's school who gives a realistic portrayal of the arguments put into motion about the education process. Also Olivia Williams as Miss Stubbs gives another fantastic performance as a teacher who is disillusioned with the education process short of the few brilliant students like Jenny who make it worthwhile again.<br /><br />I can't express properly would an enjoyable story this was and what a great journey. Women did not have as many options in those days as we do now and seeing the comparisons isawakening. This is the best and most subtle romance story that I saw from 2009 as well in a time when everything is a rom-com or a Nicholas Sparks overboard of tears, this one blends the romance with the story of a young woman's search for identity and deciding her future. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.hat I saw from 2009 as well in a time when everything is a rom-com or a Nicholas Sparks overboard of tears, this one blends the romance with the story of a young woman's search for identity and deciding her future.

B002BWP3XO|5.0|\\"Fish Tank\\" was written and directed by Andrea Arnold. It is a gritty, disturbing coming-of-age story for Mia played by Katie Jarvis, a fifteen year old girl who wishes to be a dancer but lacks raw talent and makes up for it with raw attitude against everyone in her life until the introduction of her mother's new boyfriend, Connor played by Michael Fassbender makes a major impact on her life.<br /><br />First off, I never deciphered the title. Why Fish Tank? There is a fish in it and some swimming in the water but at no point did I feel this girl was trapped in her life and while she maintained a bit of routine aka swimming in circles, I felt she went through a great deal of journey and changing up of her habits due to new circumstances introduced into her environment so....why?<br /><br />Next, the main character Mia is almost impossible to like. The biggest problem is that she is difficult to understand when she is speaking and at least 25% of her lines were lost. She is hostile and spews bile out of her mouth at anyone who even glances at her the wrong way. The littlest thing sets her off and even when someone takes a chance on her and shows her attention, tries to get her to smile and encourages her to pursue her goals, she'll turn on them in a heartbeat. Granted, not everyone here is deserving of good behavior, in fact all the characters have a dark streak in them and rub each other the wrong way, but her temper is so explosive that it becomes difficult to make excuses for her purely based on environment and genetics. She has a few fleeting moments of happiness and has a very pretty smile in those rare moments but she never holds on to it and pushes it away as if it makes her vulnerable. This is one tough cookies, almost inaccessible to anyone who speaks to her until a particularly hot older man breaks her down.<br /><br />All that being said, Katie Jarvis' first movie role as Mia was pretty amazing. The unsentimental presence that she stays guarded with throughout is consistent and compelling for a new performer. Her own dream is to be able to dance but her stiff movements and lack of a gift for rhythm makes all of her moves, no matter how rehearsed seem forced and unnatural. She is extremely defensive and secretive about her dream until she lets another character deeper into her life. The peeling away of the layers and slowly exposing the depths of her character also reveals ulterior motivations of the others in her family. Jarvis' talent is proven in how unsettling the movie feels until the eventual mild, calm ending.<br /><br />The most enjoyable (if there is something to enjoy here) part of the movie was Michael Fassbender as Connor. Obviously he is an attractive man shirtless but he has an effortless charm and walks the line perfectly between responsible adult and possible lech for a minor. You can't tell what side he is leaning towards because all of his actions and remarks can be seen in both lights and it really keeps you guessing throughout. Either way, the impression is given that he cares about Mia for some reason and encourages her to help her succeed and perhaps the factor that he might be the only person to do that for her wrapped up in a sexy package feeds Mia's hidden desire for him.<br /><br />The story was riveting and difficult to look away from. It ties your insides up into a knot and stays that way for the two hour duration and is so disturbing that it sticks with you and I have a stomach ache sitting here immediately afterward. The acts were well set up gradually increasing the stakes and suspense and a few scenes I couldn't look away even if I wanted to! The shaky cam was only occasionally distracting and overall served the movie well for realism. The lighting was not always lit in such a way that you could see the characters and the experimentation with light and shadow and focus made the reality take on a different feel adding suspense and confusion. Using these techniques, the film takes on thefeel of a waking nightmare while displaying a window into British lower-class.ing a window into British lower-class.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I did not think I was going to like it when I sat down toread it. I was wrong. I do not usually write reviews, but this book touched me in such a profound way that I felt compelled to write this directly after I finished. This is the best book I have read in a long time. It is one that drags you into the pages where you will endure the hardships and tradgedies and be consumed by the raw emotions of loss and love that these women feel. An amazing book that will leave you thinking about the characters long after you read the last page.

B002N8A14M|1.0|I thought that this armband and case was great, until I tried to plug in any earphones that I had (3 different types) into the Nano in the hard case, all of which would not fully plug into the Nano, due to the hard case being in the way.    This is a major problem for me, as I got this armband/case to listen to my ipod while I drive very, very loud machinery and have to use earphones. I can't use the measly little speakers that the ipod comes with. Also, there is no way to attach the ipod to the armband without the case. This makes this product totally useless to me.

B002N5N5M0|1.0|After brining in Jimmy Smits for season 3, producers informed us that John Lithgow would be joining the cast for season 4.    Knowing this immediately took most of the suspense out of season 4.  We knew right away that John Lithgow would die at the hand of Dexter during the last episode.  So we are left to watch as Dexter and Trinity connect and await Trinity's inevitable death.    The supporting cast was left on the sidelines this season.  They were forced to endure a pathetic storyline of romance problems that are painful to watch.    There were a couple of key characters which were killed off this season so hopefully Dexter can get back to business in season 5.

B0031ZWZR2|3.0|This series seems identical to Robert Sawyer's novel of the same name. As in the novel, most of the planet loses consciousness. While \\"out\\", they see what will happen to them in six months. There is, of course, a law and order aspect to the show with chiefly Joseph Fiennes and John Cho playing two FBI agents and their attempts to solve the mystery behind the flashforward. This was absent from the Sawyer work and is the least interesting aspect of the show. The most interesting aspect of the show is the individual stories of the people who experienced it and their lives unfolding after the experience. Number One story is a young surgeon who has advanced cancer yet sees himself in the flashforward falling for a young Japanese woman in a Japanese restaurant. Another story is of the scientist who comes forward to claim responsibility for the flashforward even while his autistic son is in the hospital. There he meets the married woman he saw himself being with six months from now, his son's doctor. Then there are the people who saw themselves nowhere doing nothing--presumably they are dead six months from now. These stories are very compelling, just like the novel was. I wish the whole law enforcement aspect of this could be jettisoned as it is such a cliche. I can see why Sawyer left it out of the novel. It was something that happened to the whole planet in the novel which had no law enforcement overtones. NO ONE could explain it in any way. If you want a real treat, READ Robert Sawyer's novel FLASHFORWARD. Note: I am still watching this show, after the episodes in this DVD and I am sad to report that the FBI aspect of the show has just about totally taken it over.  I am probably going to stop watching this show.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|An Education is a coming of age tale about a sixteen-year-old girl who falls in love with a man twice her age. Relatively unknown Danish director Lone Scherfig has created a film that truly captures the innocence of youth. The script itself is based upon the memoirs of British journalist Lynn Barber who didn't originally publish her story until this year. There was an essay written in the \\"Granta\\", a student publication at Cambridge University, which featured Barber's personal story. Screenwriter Nick Hornby read this and immediately was draw to the story. He states that what appealed to him most was this \\"suburban girl who's frightened that she's going to get cut out of everything good that happens in the city. That, to me, is a big story in popular culture. It's the story of pretty much every rock 'n' roll band.\\" Hornby, a novelist himself, also wrote the screen adaptation for such popular films as High Fidelity and About a Boy, and applies his usual shrewd understanding of pop palatability again here.<br /><br />Production designer Andrew McAlpine masterfully constructs a somber setting of post-World War II London. A feeling of repression lingers in each scene which so eloquently demonstrate what the city was like before the huge artistic counterculture of the 1960s. The period itself plays into the characters a great deal, because it is the foundation for so much of who they are and how they approach the circumstances before them. There is a vast contrast of moods created by the littlest things like a rainstorm or a costume change. Scherfig keeps the visual angels on screen low and close to the actors throughout the entire film. For such a character driven piece, this is a brilliant tactic by the director because it creates an intimacy where empathy otherwise might not readily lend to the audience. But ultimately, it is the performances that truly bring this story and this film to the limelight.<br /><br />Young British actress Carey Mulligan astutely portrays the main character of Jenny. Up until now, she has been widely under the radar, appearing mainly on British television and in supporting roles in such films as Pride & Prejudice and Public Enemies. Scherfig had auditioned many girls for the part, but something about Mulligan captivated her. \\"Carey was always the one I liked best,\\" she says. \\"We adjusted the part a little bit to her.\\" She is attractive without being too glamorous and captures the essence of Jenny by fostering an intelligent yet idealistic adolescent. The way Mulligan interacts with her costars conveys an actress well beyond her years. Many have justfully compared her to screen legend Audrey Hepburn. But will Mulligan have the same kind of golden appeal to excite an Academy Award? Most critics have already deemed her as a lock for a nomination, if not the current front-runner, and I am most certainly in agreement. Mulligan's performance clearly registers as one of the best of the year. You can see the determination and ambition in her eyes, while still maintaining a demonstrative sense of naivet&eacute;.<br /><br />\\"Carey has a sweetness to her that suits the film. If we had written it that way, I would worry the film was overly cute. But she is really like that, it comes to her naturally. I chose to risk a little more of that rather than focus on Jenny's lippiness and fighting with her father.\\" proclaims Scherfig. Jenny is the victim of her parent's expectations. They seek to mold her into being an accomplished student and ultimately gain acceptance into the prestigious Oxford University. This is obviously more of her father's notion than her own. Jenny herself fantasizes of a cigarette-smoking, music embellishing, French culture driven world that she has only read about. As naturally expected of most all suppressed individuals, Jenny seeks to rebel, but only subtly at first. She sneaks around with her girlfriends, smoking and gossiping, as any normal teenage girl might. She even has captured the fancy of a young boy, played by Matthew Beard, who courts Jenny early in the film under the surveillance of her parents. Until this point, it seems like Jenny's life is pretty atypical. This all changes once she meets David.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard plays the part of David Goldman, an eccentric thirty-something year old who divides his time between extravagant outings and his so-called business endeavors. Sarsgaard reminds me a great deal of a friend of mine (Benji) who not only looks a lot like him, but has the same kind of restless ambition that is easily alluring. David not only manages to charm Jenny with his debonair style and whirlwind ideals of romance, but everyone else he encounters as well. David inadvertently stumbles upon Jenny in a chance meeting while he is driving by in his maroon colored Bristol, amidst a torrential downpour outside the studio where she has cello rehearsals. He implores her to save her instrument from water damage by allowing him to chauffer it to her destination. He assures her that he's merely interested in rescuing her cello and suggests that she just walks along side the car as he drives. Jenny succumbs and soon enough, she too is being driven home by this perfectly charming stranger. So begins Jenny's relationship with David, and the heart of the story.<br /><br />By today's standards, it would be easy to dismiss this courtship as immoral and inappropriate, considering their age difference. But that instinctive reaction is easily dismissed after it becomes very apparent that Jenny is courting David just as much. The encounters she has as a direct result of dating David force a sophistication upon her that she questionably may not be ready to coop with. Sarsgaard is both appealing and devious all at once. He certainly knows that Jenny is far younger than him, but asks her out just the same, \\"Do you go to concerts?\\" Jenny responds, \\"No, we don't believe in concerts.\\" \\"Oh, I assure you, they're real.\\" She accepts his invitation under the condition that he is able to gain her parent's permission. No easy feat considering just how controlling her they are, particularly her father Jack, played by Alfred Molina. But his suave tactics prevail, as David showers Jenny's mother Marjorie (Cara Seymour) with compliments and manages to relate to Jack on his level. All of a sudden, Jenny is catapulted into a world where she no longer is just imagining this extravagant lifestyle; she is actually living in it.<br /><br />Molina's performance as Jenny's overbearing yet sincere father is nothing short of brilliant. He adds depth and persona to an otherwise annoying character, by conveying true sincerity while still communal. His yelling and commanding tone reaches beyond just maintaining control of his household. Jack seeks to guide his only child to a path of certainty and security. And even though his constant bellowing may seem like him just being an overprotective father, Molina reveals himself to be much more, as a genuinely concerned guardian. Himself, a vastly underrated actor, Molina has finally garnished the kind of praise that may grant him an Oscar nomination next February. I think he deserved more attention for his turn as Diego Rivera in Frida, but it is better late than never.<br /><br />Jenny can be categorized as the classic overachiever. She is studious, yet still popular among her peers. She romanticizes about exploring worlds beyond the realm of London and goes to great extent to study neighboring cultures, particularly French. There are a few key figures in her life, outside of her parents, who have the most influence on her. Well at least until David comes along. First, there is her Literature teacher Miss Stubbs, played by Olivia Williams. She regards Jenny as her prized pupil, one who she holds to the highest expectations. She imposes this ideal upon Jenny that students like her are \\"the reason\\" why she is teacher. And that concept is what weighs on Jenny's mind throughout all of her explorations. Emma Thompson also bears some significance on her as the Headmistress of Jenny's school. She often is tasked with grounding Jenny's whims and continuously reminds her of the importance of being an accomplished, educated young woman. It is these educators who serve Jenny in the most practical of ways, and remind us all of how underrated and unappreciated teachers often are.<br /><br />There are a number of things that come to mind when you think about coming of age stories. And while this may fall under such a story category, it most certainly is not stereotypical. There is so much simplistic beauty in An Education, but the film is nonetheless palletized with complex situations and characters. As we watch Jenny grow before our eyes, our appreciation for our own life trials is heightened. Most everyone can remember what it was like to be sixteen. For some, it was a time for exploration, and for others, a time for establishment. But not many of us truly experience such a worldly erudition as Jenny does at that age. The lessons that she finds herself engulfed in cannot be found in any book or taught in any classroom. Both Scherfig and Hornby must have carefully considered this in their creative processes. Carey Mulligan's turn as this impressionable and bewildered girl with this undeniable thirst for culture and knowledge is nothing short of remarkable. She absolutely blossoms on the screen. Mulligan embraces an image of innocence while flourishing in the circumstances of her new found \\"education\\". And as we watch Jenny out on the town, attending concerts and going to fine restaurants rather than merely dreaming of it all from her bedroom floor whilst listening to Juliette Greco records, we too are educated.

B003CN5SAY|4.0|Throughout this final season, our two doctors begin to see signs that they may be redundant in a financial world which crashed.  Their success was largely dependent on lots of cash being available for elective cosmetic surgery. Also, Sean's and Christian's relationship becomes the pivotal aspect of the show, not any other relationship. This sets off the best episode in the entire five seasons when the two of them start going to couples psychotherapy with a psychiatrist.  I have never laughed so hard as I did through that episode.  That was pure five stars all the way.  However, the way the series winds down with the final handling of all the characters is what pushes it down to four stars.  Many of the characters you've grown to love or hate are brought to conclusions which strain credulity, even in a show which was always campy and over the top. I'm reluctant to say more about how anyone ends up as that will ruin it for viewers.  Let me concentrate on the highlights instead: Julia's mother tries to wrest custody away of the children with Julia planning and achieving ultimate comeuppance for her mother at long last.  Sean gets involved with a woman who is a black widow style killer who in turn meets a serial killer, which ironically saves Sean.  Sean going ballistic with the serial killer in the police station is the ultimate in camp hilarity. Matt tries to find himself as a boardwalk Mime (he's a very good mime) which leads to a massive criminal law mess which presents several way, way over the top resolutions.  If your sense of hilarity and absurdity are well in place, you will enjoy this final season.

B001FB55L2|3.0|This movie was a little bit better than I expected, but I probably won't watch it again for quite a while. Some scenes were tense and suspenseful. Everybody did an awesome job. Gyllenhaal and Maguire play two brothers named Tommy and Sam Cahill. When Sam goes missing in action, Tommy spends more time with Sam's wife, Grace and his two little girls. After a few months, Sam is found and is traumatized. He starts accusing Tommy of sleeping with his wife and becomes angry very easily. I'd probably recommend BROTHERS!!!

The ending has one gem of interest, which I enjoyed, however, I would not recommend this book.    I have now seen the movie, The Lovely Bones, and enjoyed that much more than the book.

B000001FN8|5.0|After [[ASIN:B000001EUP Blackout]] and [[ASIN:B000001EUR Love at First Sting]], everyone was expecting miracles from the Scorpions - they had become one of the best known, best selling metal groups of the 80's. This album answered that - it was just slightly off the frenetic pace of the previous two albums, but it still had a lot to offer, most of it loud.<br /><br />It opens with \\"Don't Stop At The Top\\", which is still one of my favorite Scorps tunes to date - classic twin guitars with their own style. \\"Rhythm Of Love\\" is next, slightly quieter, but the song that made the Billboard charts with good reason. \\"Passion Rules the Game\\", \\"Media Overkill\\", and \\"Every Minute Every Day\\" are also good solid rockers, and will probably catch your attention.<br /><br />\\"Walking On The Edge\\" and \\"Believe In Love\\" are the two quietest songs on the album, and depending on your tastes, may actually be some of the best. \\"We Let It Rock...\\" is a definite party song (much like \\"The Same Thrill\\" from [[ASIN:B000001EUR Love at First Sting]]).<br /><br />\\"Love On The Run\\" is the fastest, loudest, heaviest song on the album, solid rock guaranteed to do some damage to your speakers.<br /><br />Overall, it's just a hair under the manic efforts of the previous two albums, but it's definitely worth getting for any rock / metal / Scorpions collection.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Daft Punk's Interstella 5555 is a movie that rekindled my interest in the French electronic music duo after 10 years of estrangement.  I first bought the album [[ASIN:B000000WCV Homework]] after hearing \\"Around the World\\" and \\"Da Funk.\\"  Shortly after my purchase I lost interest in the songs and musical genre... that is until I listened to [[ASIN:B000059MEK Discovery]] (every track from the album is animated in continuous chapters of a story betrayed in the movie Interstella 5555, with no dialogue and minimal sound effects).  Daft punk teamed up with legendary Leiji Matsumoto to combine their electronic music recordings with his classic Japanese animation.    I've listened to any random selection of songs from the \\"Discovery\\" album multiple days of every week since first being introduced to it almost a year ago, and it hasn't gotten old due in part to the creative genius of Daft Punk and Matsumoto.  Interstella 5555 gives visual enjoyment to the distinctive sounds of each track.  While I listen to the music I can picture every scene from the movie with a continued appreciation of the hard work and talent that went into creating it.  I eventually had to go out and buy this movie because it has such an emotional draw on my conscious.    Don't buy this movie if you're looking for a something with dialogue.  On the other hand, if you're looking to let go and let a movie's craft, similar to watching \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" while listening to Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" take over... this is a perfect fit.  Interstella 5555 is definitely not the end of the yellow brick road for Daft Punk.    I am now an avid junkie of their music.  Buy this DVD, the Discovery CD and keep your eyes open for anything Daft Punk!
B000001EUR|5.0|If you know any song from this album, it's \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" - that song hit #25 on Billboard's 'Hot 100' list, and the album itself went platinum the year it was released.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a good song - loud, rocking, easy to remember, with a weird video to go with it (the band members in a cage). Overall, it's one of the better songs on the album - but there's (almost) nothing on this album that's quiet; there's nothing on here that doesn't rock.<br /><br />It's an excellent, hard rocking follow-up to [[ASIN:B000001EUP Blackout]] - everything on this album is good or even great. It opens with \\"Bad Boys Running Wild\\", which is the classic Scorpions sound, and was actually the first song from the album to start getting airplay. That's followed by \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\", nice loud and rocking. Next is \\"I'm Leaving You\\", which reminds you of earlier songs like \\"No One Like You\\" or \\"Can't Live Without You\\", quite good.<br /><br />The fourth song in the lineup - \\"Coming Home\\" - starts out quiet, but quickly kicks into the loudest, hardest song on the album... the transition from quiet to loud will make your heart slam through a few stops.<br /><br />\\"The Same Thrill\\" is a party song, loud and blazing, though with slightly repitious lyrics. \\"Big City Nights\\" is in the same vein as \\"Bad Boys Running Wild\\", and got lots of airplay out of Boston because the initials matched a radio station's call sign. \\"As Soon As The Good Times Roll\\" is a little quieter, but just like everything else on this album, it rocks nicely. \\"Crossfire\\" is a little odd, a percursor to their 'peace' songs, which culminated with \\"Wind of Change\\" from [[ASIN:B000001FYZ Crazy World]] - the drum work is crisp and sharp, and works very well with the guitars to create a militaristic sound. The final song is \\"Still Loving You\\", the only real ballad on the album, with vocalist Klaus Meine putting everything into it.<br /><br />If you like the Scorpions, if you like their 80's sound, if you like metal and rock, then you need to grab this album - along with \\"Blackout\\", it's one of the best they've ever done.grab this album - along with \\"Blackout\\", it's one of the best they've ever done.
B002RAREAK|2.0|There are not too many words to say about that CD, there are only 2 songs that sound like anything and the rest is \\"I don't know what it is\\", I feel that Usher is fighting against himself because that Cd was all over the place, personally I feel that ex wife of his done took something from him because he's not that R&B artist that we all are use to, the CD was very immature on some songs and the others should not have been a thought, \\"There goes my baby\\" and \\"Daddy home\\" to me are the only songs that give me any notion that that was Usher.  Now if you really listen to some of the words of them songs you might just think twice, he really need to grow it up a little more because he is really \\"slacking\\" lately.  Me, myself blames Ms. ex wifey.
B000002VBY|5.0|Every metalhead knows this album - and for good reason.<br /><br />\\"Screaming In The Night\\" was actually the song that got the most radio play from this album, and it's good - if a bit quiet. Nothing else from the album is quiet, that's for sure.<br /><br />\\"Headhunter\\", \\"Eat the Rich\\", \\"Night Wolf\\" (where I get my name), \\"Ready to Burn\\"... those and others are solid metal, ripping through the guitars and bass and drums, blowing out speakers. Metal and rock that anyone can appreciate.<br /><br />\\"Stayed Awake All Night\\" is a remake of an old [[ASIN:B000B8I8IM BTO]] hit, well done. Everything else is original Krokus, loud and nasty.<br /><br />This was /the/ album of 1983, and you only have to listen to it to know why. Solid loud rock, metal... trash your stereo with this one. Definitely a must-have in any metal collection.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|When my dad asked me to order this DVD for him, I didn't know what to expect.  When I ordered the DVD, I was allowed to watch it instantly online as well, so I did, and wow! What can I say?  I've known for a long time that there were problems with the way food is produced in this country--the increasingly frequent outbreaks of e. coli and salmonella are indication enough of that--but this documentary revealed things that were surprising even to me.  Yet, even as the documentary shows you the good, the bad, and the ugly of our food industry, they manage to do so in a way that doesn't come off as preachy or condescending.  You journey through several different farms, from huge, stifling factory farms to an \\"old-fashioned\\" farm where cattle still eat grass and the chickens still see sunlight.  You meet farmers that have been put impossibly deep in debt by the demands of the industry that contracted them, honest people that were prosecuted and denied their livelihood when they committed no crime, and a mother who lost her son to tainted meat and continues to fight for stronger regulation of the industry.  You're shown the facts about where our food comes from, how it's made, and how it reaches us, and at the end there is a very simple message--by shopping smarter and choosing food that has been produced humanely and sustainably, we have the power to change the food industry for the better.    I highly recommend this documentary.

0061849928|5.0|`The Crying of Lot 49' takes us on a winding, convoluted, terrifying roller coaster through a world that seems to be a few steps closer to that of Lewis Carroll's `Alice in Wonderland' than our own. The work itself refuses to be read at a pace any less than how it intends, and that often crazed pace creates a response within the reader of confusion, urgency, and uncertainty, all driven by a maddening obsession that ultimately leads the reader on a journey to search for the truth.<br /><br />This piece has a tendency to observe the reader, as if it were self-aware. It sits, patiently knowing it will soon be picked up; it waits to be read through from start to finish in a few short days (or sittings); it waits for the reader to set down the recently pristine paperback. Now riddled with creases and slick with the grime of sweaty palms, it begins to grin as the telltale look of consternation and disbelief cross the reader's face, and, with maniacal glee, for their lips to part and the words to escape, giving voice to all the thoughts you will surely be left with after this book is done.<br /><br />'Lot 49' singlehandedly explained a semesters Literary Theory course to me. While I had a lot of trouble specifically defining the purpose of literary criticism most of the course, the amazingly poignant truths that shine through the maddening uncertainty made a very lasting impact on me, and I think they will do so for many people to come.

0385342039|5.0|Reading a Sophie Kinsella book is one of my guilty pleasures. All of her novels are light weight reads that don't require a whole lot of thought. I am surprised to see that so many people on here find the premise of this book \\"unbelievable\\".     Really? Are ANY of her books \\"believable\\"? If so, then I guess it IS possible that a high powered lawyer can run out of  a meeting after discovering she made a huge mistake. Get on a train and wind up in a village, knock on the door of some random house, and end up becoming the house-keeper/cook for the rich owners that live there.     Oh yeah, I remember the time that I got VERY drunk on a plane, and confessed every one of my deepest secrets to a complete stranger. Know what happened then? That very same stranger became my new boss. I was soooo humiliated.    Sure. These things happen every day.     This book is actually different in the fact that the heroine, Lara, is actually very level headed and down to earth. While attending the funeral of her great aunt Sadie, the spirit of the aunt begins to haunt Lara, demanding she find some way to stop the funeral and help Sadie get back a necklace that means a great deal to her. In doing this, Lara discovers some shocking secrets about her family. Along the way, Lara meets a handsome American and finds out her best friend a business partner is a total fraud.     Read this book. It will not disappoint. Sophie Kinsella is a genius.     Maybe her next book will be more believable to some. It's about a two year old shopaholic. Seriously.
B0000004F9|4.0|Update- April 29, 2011    Alright, I have some good news.  Volume One has actually grown on me a little bit.  The weaker moments have grown on me enough to help the overall album score go up to a 4 out of 5.      I'm still a strong believer that their jazzier period is significantly better, and this is just a nice introduction to what would become a more interesting career a couple years later, but some of the organ work in particular, for whatever reason, just seems better to me *now* compared to the last time I listened to it.   I can't explain how such an improvement is possible (because I do recall giving the album a couple very close listens) but there you have it.  Perhaps I'm just a more content listener now.    \\"So Boot If At All\\" has really won me over as well.  It's not quite the Deep Purple ripoff like I initially believed.  It's probably more like a cross between early Deep Purple and moments of avant garde King Crimson.  It's actually a pretty good jam after all.  Even the drumming catches my attention and honestly most of the time the drum work is my least favorite aspect of a song because I've heard an astonishing number of drum jams over the years.  Not that this is necessarily entirely a drum jam, mind you.     My one complaint (and the reason I refuse to give the album a perfect 5 star rating) is because there's some seriously repetitive moments on side two, such as \\"We Did It Again\\" and \\"Why Are We Sleeping?\\".  At least on the latter the female vocals really appeal to me because, well, I just love the late 60's rock scene and those vocals do a perfect job capturing the time period.    I'm also STILL not particularly fond of the vocals in \\"Hope for Happiness\\".  The way the vocal melody is delivered sounds forced and awkward, especially when the lead singer repeats the line \\"happiness, happiness, happiness\\" three times in a row.   It's a minor complaint though because other aspects of the song have finally become appealing to me (and therefore, I'msatisfied with it).  It's just that one specific part that doesn't sound right to me.    Overall, I'm glad I gave Volume One another careful listen because the Soft Machine is one band that really deserves the attention.    Anyway, here's my old review which I'll leave up because I feel some of my opinions still hold true.        This is a review for Volume One.    Let's be honest guys- Soft Machine is mostly incredible because of their Third album, and for the few albums they released after that one (which is based almost entirely in a jazzy style- something the Soft Machine were the masters of).    The very first album is, quite frankly, *extremely* underwhelming.  First of all, the sound quality is atrociously dated.  People complain about the sound quality in Third, but I'd gladly take THAT over what's presented here.      This album doesn't prove to me anything about the bands potential other than the band members were big Deep Purple fans back in the beginning.      \\"So Boot If At All\\" is seriously just an overlong, amateur Deep Purple-inspired jam.  It does nothing to blow me away, and that's why Deep Purple is remembered these days over what the Soft Machine were attempting here.  This jam only perks my interest when the drum solo comes in later on.  The rest of it is obviously ripped off directly from the revolutionary style of Deep Purple.    \\"Hope for Happiness\\" is almost unbearable thanks to both the sound quality and the songwriting.  This song sounds a LOT like early Caravan, except Caravan wouldn't have written something so unmemorable and forgettable.  The vocals are quite messy and unorganized too.  The minute long keyboard jam is nice though.  I had to listen to this song about 10 times just to remember it.  I shouldn't have to do that when it comes to pop music.    \\"Joy of a Toy\\" is a Jimi Hendrix inspiration... do you see where I'm going here?  There's nothing groundbreaking about this album like other people have tried telling me.  Check out theThird, Fourth and Fifth albums for a style of rock/jazz fusion that *definitely* doesn't sound like anyone else out there.      The rest of the album contains more dated and forgettable songwriting.  This is definitely a must-skip album.  I'm surprised because I went in expecting a lost classic from the late 60's and instead got a somewhat overrated album instead.    \\"A Certain Kind\\" contains some gorgeous vocals.  This is easily the best song on the album.    The Soft Machine is such a great band, and thankfully they progressed past the forgettable early days and made a name for themselves with some of the finest jazz rock I've honestly ever heard.  Stick with those albums.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I loved this movie...it is funny, sad, great!  A must see in my book..
B000H8RWEM|5.0|What makes Soft Machine's Six much different from the previous two albums is how the band returned to their melodic, jazzier ways that made them successful on their Third album.      Six actually sounds like a continuation of Third and that's a *great* thing.  These jams are much easier to get into (in other words, less challenging) not to mention quite melodic and exciting for the most part, compared to the Fourth and Fifth albums.      This is definitely an album that wasn't given enough credit back in the day, and apparently that still holds true in todays world since only 12 people here on amazon have reviewed this album so far.      Seriously, if you're someone who likes lots of jazzy jams combined with rock and done so in a tasteful and melodic way with saxophones, keyboards and drums played in a distinctly creative and moody kind of way, I highly recommend Six.   However, for more challenging and straight up jazz albums (with very little connection to rock) Fourth and Fifth are worth exploring as well.    There are a couple flaws though.  A couple songs that shouldn't have been included on the album.  Those would be \\"5 From 13\\" which is a very unnecessary drum solo (come on, I've had to experience WAY too many of these over the years) and \\"Lefty\\" which I guess is supposed to be some kind of experimental mood piece but ends up sounding like noodling during a rehearsal.     As far as the second disc is concerned, well truth be told, it's not as good as the first one.  The best song is unquestionably \\"Stanley Stamps Gibbon Album\\" because it's another solid Soft Machine jam.  I believe some of the saxophone notes from \\"Chloe and the Pirates\\" were lifted directly from \\"37 1/2\\".  It's still a GREAT song though, with lots of atmosphere.  The biggest disappointment is definitely \\"1983\\".  It consists of one ominous-sounding piano riff repeating for several minutes on end, never really changing until the final minute.  Of course by then it's too late to capture my interest.    But the one thing that's still a mystery is just what IS the picture on the album cover supposed to be?  It looks gross, whatever it is!

0061876747|3.0|A promising premise: 21st century man alone in a large city (he DOES speak the language) hiding from both the police, who want him for a murder he didn't commit, as well as the evil forces who really did it (and if that doesn't sound Kafkaesque, the author throws in a reference early on to make sure you think about it--should have thrown in a Hitchcock reference as well).  As I remembered liking one his earlier books (Brazzaville Beach), I looked forward to it.  Unfortunately the promise disappointed me:  First of all, the setup was a clumsy deus-ex-machina, based on incredible coincidence and some unbelievably stupid acts by a highly intelligent man.  If the plot was focused on the protagonist's experiences on hiding out and figuring out the truth, it still might have worked well.  But it was overly embellished by the excessively evil actions of the bad folks' agent, and way too many details about the unbelievably clueless CEO of the EVIL pharmaceutical company (also unbelievable; any Pharma that tried to put profits ahead of patients' well being in this fashion wouldn't be making profits for long).  After the fall of the Soviet Union, LeCarre resorted to this evil empire in The Constant Gardener.  You'd think thriller writers would have found a more believable bad guy--if you're anti-corporate, how about an oil or mining company??  In addition, the various subplots just added bulk without any extra nourishment.
B001B223TW|1.0|STOP!  Thank goodness I caught you before you clicked on \\"Proceed to Checkout.\\"  It pains me to give this such a bad review as I love opera on Blu-ray and would like to do everything I can to encourage their sales; but there is simply no reason to preserve such a dismal performance.    I think it was Caruso that said all this opera requires is the five best singers in the world.  Only Hvorostovsky comes close.  Though still somewhat light in timbre he seems to have developed into a true Verdian baritone.  Azucena is passable.  This is my first exposure to the Manrico, Jose Cura. He essentially has a baritonal timbre with no \\"squillo\\" in his high notes.  To me he lacked the finesse and the vocal splendor needed.  Villoreal as Leonora lacked the richness in tone and fluidity of line the part requires.  The conducting was slow and robbed the music of its drama.    In terms of staging, the concepts ranged from bizzare (the Count's soldiers doing a silly dance with swords while wearing aviator glasses) to offensive (the Count's soldiers raping Azucena).    The stage director seemed to want an intimate affair in which the principals get six inches from each other's face and whisper to each other.  Come on, guys--there's nothing subtle about Trovatore.  You want some great voices to plant their feet and give us some \\"can belto\\" singing.  This just doesn't deliver.  And someone needs to take Manrico out and give him a good scrubbing--would a lady like Leonora fall for a guy who is perpetually caked with mud?  The video was dark and the sound quality muffled.    I am not familiar with other DVD's of this opera to offer an alternative.  However, I will recommend three wonderful audio CD sets:  Bjoerling, Milanov, Warren on RCA  Domingo, Price, Milnes on RCA  Corelli, Price, Bastiannini on DGG.    For examples of how wonderful opera can be on Blu-ray, try Manon with Netrebko, Eugene Onegin with Hvorostovsky and Flemming, or Traviata with Gheorghiu.

There are these new Star Wars prequel video reviews for The Phantom Movie and Attack of the Clowns.

0618918248|1.0|A book designed to convince only Empiricists who know next to nothing about epistemology, theology, and moral philosophy. Logical fallacies abound in this book. If this is the strongest the New Atheists have against the claims of Scripture, I have nothing to worry about.<br /><br />An example of one such fallacy occurs with Dawkins' attempted defence of morality. After meandering around in statistics, which prove little about religion and can be manipulated in the case of peoples (ie. Lies, Lies, and Statistics), Dawkins pulls out his argument against religion according to morality by toying with the idea of Kant's Categorical Imperatives. It would have been laugheable if it was not serious, since Dawkins proved he is way out of his depth by not even interacting with the problems with Kantian ethics. Instead, Dawkins decided that the best way to attack religion in the are of morality is to point out how he thinks the Bible promotes atrocities. Of couse, it is simply sadly amusing to see Dawkins pontificate about the interpretation of biblical events and show his utter ignorance of theology in the process, as if his eisegetical interpretations are embraced by anyone at all.<br /><br />Throughout that section, Dawkins assumed the categories of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" without even defining how these categories could exist at all in his worldview consistently. Instead, he engages in circular reasoning whereby what is right is defined by Darwinian social conventions. So what we know what is right is because \\"right\\" has been defined by social conventions which evolved in a Darwinian fashion. However, we know that these social conventions which evolved in a Darwinian fashion are right because we have just said that they are right.<br /><br />This totally subjectivist view of ethics is logically incompatible with the absolutist stance of Dawkins on various issues like his insistance that is is absolutely wrong for \\"children to be indoctrinated\\". Perhaps it is the case that our \\"evolved Darwinian social conventions\\" actually say that it is right for \\"children to be indoctrinated\\", in which case Dawkins is wrong. Judging by the numerical superiority of those who are religious compared to those who are not, Dawkins' absolutist stance on this issue is contradictory with his supposed \\"embrace\\" of Darwinian social conventions defining what is and is not right. After all, if what is \\"right\\" is defined by Darwianin evolution of our social norms, then what is \\"right\\" is defined by the majority of society. Therefore, not only on the issue of \\"indoctrination of children\\", but also on whether religion is good etc, Dawkins is wrong on these issues according to his own subjectivist system of ethics.<br /><br />If Dawkins truly believes that what is \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" is defined by Darwinian evolution of social norms, let him stop his anti-theistic and anti-Christian screed and follow the norms regarding the rightness and wrongness of religious behavior held by the majority of the people in the world. Otherwise, we have the opportunity to see a visible display of Ps. 14:1 - \\"The fool says in his heart: there is no God &c\\"l conventions\\" actually say that it is right for \\"children to be indoctrinated\\", in which case Dawkins is wrong. Judging by the numerical superiority of those who are religious compared to those who are not, Dawkins' absolutist stance on this issue is contradictory with his supposed \\"embrace\\" of Darwinian social conventions defining what is and is not right. After all, if what is \\"right\\" is defined by Darwianin evolution of our social norms, then what is \\"right\\" is defined by the majority of society.

For example, in one passage, the authors contend that meetings and detailed procedures often waste time and don't yield that much value.    You may not agree with everything in Rework and possibly find parts of it reductive or even discomforting. But it's worth reading and, at its best, inspiring. It's also hard not to appreciate the authors' openness and willingness to reveal what's worked for them, personally and in their business.

0307271862|3.0|The first half of this book is nice and catched my attention really well. The part in Sweden is cool and misterious. By 1/3 of the book, the reason of the crimes is revealed (and it is a pretty silly and not well explained thing) then the next 2/3 of the books, just turn into a bad Sidney Sheldon kind of novel - without any mistery, any interesting happenings... In the beginning, you might thing that Brigitta - the main character - will be developed, but no. We don't get to know much about her and she is the main character. The characters are not deep in general and their motivation for doing what they do is not present (well, if it is there, it is very well hidden). That is not a bad reading, but it is far from being a great thriller.
1416583408|2.0|Initially I thought I might get some great insight into canine behavior based on what I have heard on interview programs with and about the author. But I found that although she occasionally will point out something informative, the reader gets lost in the volumous verbage employed by the author. It is as if she is trying to impress with her command of the English language and the usage of words many of us common folk have never heard of and therefore do not truly understand without going to a dictionary. I found that in just a few short sentences I had totally lost what the intent of the chapter or paragraphs were supposed to be about. Adorable quips about her experiences, but completely lacking in real informative material due to her rambling format. I give it 2 stars---sorry.

They are different in some sense: Dan Ariely defends the ideas of behavioral economics and justifies this theories based on lab experiments (that I sometimes find somewhat artificial) - Levitt from Freakonomics is a more like a classical kind of economist and he justifies based on analysis of real data. Although I agree more with Levitt kind of explanations, I enjoyed Dan Ariely's book quite a lot. He is an amazing writer and the book is full of brilliant insights. I definitely recommend.

1847242537|3.0|I read this very quickly because I found it gripping, interesting and well paced. However, I did not like the excessive sexual violence. I do not think the author prepared enough argument or character build out to justify it. I think the publishers should have some \\"heads up\\" for appropriateness of the maturity of readers due to the theme and graphic details.<br /><br />If there was weakness it would be that one character in particular gets over a very viscous attack without much reflection or anywhere near the damage that I would have thought it would cause. Perhaps that is more addressed in later books but seems to me that her ability to continue to think clearly and strategically should have been much more impaired.<br /><br />I always enjoy well translated foreign writers. You generally capture more natural atmosphere and relationships between the characters than a foreign writer trying to describe a culture to you.  I don't know much about Sweden but I do feel now more curious to learn about the country. For example I had not spent much time understanding their fascist past because they seem so extreme in the other direction with super high taxes and generous social benefits.<br /><br />Three stars because it's a great read but not five because it's too violent without being warranted.<br /><br />By the way, on Kindle the graphics are weak which make it hard to consult the chart of the family. Considering the number of characters it is hard to follow without consulting that family tree.
1400063515|5.0|\\"The Black Swan\\" is one of the most thought-provoking books I've read (or almost read -- I'm 3/4 through). Yes, we all know that large unexpected events can change everything. But do we act like we know it? Do we insure ourselves in some way against 1929-type crashes? Few do. Why? Because we don't fully understand and take seriously the nature of the Black Swan -- the large, unexpected event.<br /><br />Thus, the market crash of 2008. We are swayed by a number of fallacies that human thinking is subject to, like buying the \\"story\\" (the latest fad in thinking like \\"Nobel Prize winners have developed the math model that shows sub-prime mortgages are safe.\\")<br /><br />Yes, the book could have been written more clearly and in a more neutral style. True, one must take action when faced with uncertainty, something Taleb doesn't focus a great deal on. And I've not read \\"Fooled by Randomness,\\" so can't judge the amount of overlap. But developing deep understanding of common fallacious lines of thought is priceless. That's what \\"The Black Swan\\" helps one with. Yey, Taleb! Your excessive ego is totally justified!

031606792X|4.0|I think this is the best of the Twilight series. Jacob has gone through a wonderful character arc of growing up and learning to have a tremendous amount of empathy for others. Bella has become much more active and mature in her self-determination. The plot flows very well while still keeping the reader's interest too. Additionally, I think Stephenie Meyer has improved a lot as a writer. It would be worth reading the rest of the series just to get to this book.
B00026WU82|5.0|It's almost like every song out'does the previous song ... and that is saying a lot, because the album kicks off with Like A Rolling Stone, an unbievalably great track. This man was in a League of his own. And how did he follow up this album? ... with Blonde on Blonde.
0439023491|4.0|As much as I enjoyed discovering and exploring the world of The Hunger Games in the first novel, I think I enjoyed this 2nd book in the trilogy more. I was more invested in the characters, and I liked seeing a shift in Katniss, the main character, as she becomes more compassionate and more aware of others as more than possible sources of competition. It's almost 400 pages long, but I found it a fast and fun read.

B0036B8MXC|5.0|I can't wait for the new episodes to come out on Friday nights. I love the story,( it is not for persons with a weak stomach,or prefer not to watch nudity) your heart will go out to Spartacus. He is forced into being a gladiator and his driving force is his hope to see his wife. This is a must get series. you will not be disappointed.
B002VPEAOE|3.0|After reading The Thirteenth Tale, I was craving something just like it. I was glad I picked up this book. I am one that likes books with a deep plot and a good amount of description, but still allow me to read quickly and lightly. The pace was just right for me.  Morton has yet to master the art of foreshadowing. From the first few pages we are told of the huge surprise at the end, which didn't show up for the last 20 pages of the book, and wasn't all that thrilling. This overly exiting foreshadowing happened many times in the book.  Despite this, and some cliches, lame phrases, it was still an enjoyable read, one I'll probably pick up again in another couple of years.
0316069906|5.0|This is a deeply philosophical, powerfully reflective and illuminating book. Having read tons of literature on this topic, I never thought there'd be so much to learn from this book... I was profoundly moved on all levels - intellectually, emotionally and spiritually. I seldom read fictions and was therefore not familiar with Foer until now, but I'm really glad he's chosen to write on this  topic (thanks to his baby boy!) because he is gifted with a writing style that is able to convey a highly important message in a most engaging and impactful way. Much unlike the more preachy and authoritative styles of most other authors on the same subject. I just couldn't put it down. Would give it SIX STARS if I could!
0061703257|3.0|I read the book after I saw the movie. Mistake. The movie provides too much of the plot, more interesting visuals, and a very handsome male lead to make the book worthwhile afterward.<br />I do applaud Lehane for his book, I'm sure if I had read it before I saw the movie I would have been completely enthralled with it.

B002VECM4K|5.0|Hype is often undeserved, especially when it comes to films. Add to the fact that PRECIOUS had Oprah attached to it and you might back off even further. But there's no need. This film, for all intents and purposes, is a phenomenon that deserves your attention.<br /><br />Garnering two Academy Award wins and multiple, smaller award show prizes, Precious is ...well ...precious. The story could've gotten dark and downright depressing. I mean, we're talking about an abused, overweight teenager who's now into her second pregnancy (incestuous pregnancy, I might add), and one can see where you could surmise this to be a gloom-and-doom movie. It isn't. It's hopeful and surprisingly upbeat. And it's well-acted by a veritable group of unknowns.<br /><br />In the prime role of Precious we have Gabby Sidibe, a first time wannabe actress who serendipitously found the casting location and locked in the role. She was the perfect choice, and gave off a sense of foreboding and hope throughout the film's length. Her flattened emotional state at home, where she's abused by her mother, contrasts perfectly with her life outside where she's trying to better herself against tremendous odds.<br /><br />But if Gabby was perfect, the woman who played Mary (her Mother) was ...beyond perfection. Mo'Nique ([[ASIN:B000MEYFXW Beerfest]]) pulls in the performance of a lifetime. Uneducated, uninspired, confused, and ill-equipped to deal with just about anything, Mo'Nique played the part so beastfully that it was sometimes hard to watch what she might do next. She was the perfect manipulator.<br /><br />Director Lee Daniels is one of those people who aren't afraid to steer directly into the path of controversy, and does so here with an able hand. You may have heard of his other successes; things like [[ASIN:B001EKGQX0 Monster's Ball]] and [[ASIN:B0007PID84 The Woodsman]]. No? Then I highly recommend you check them out if you enjoyed Precious.<br /><br />I would warn parents, though, that Precious has a very appropriate R rating attached. The scenes of incest (although short-lived) are vivid, and there's liberal use of violence against infants and teens, as well as language that'd make a p0rn-star blush. But all of it is done in an appropriate context, never for shock value.<br /><br />Precious deserves your attention. Not because it won an award, or because Oprah's attached to it. It deserves to be watched because there are too many kids out there going through this very same ordeal in social silence. Shame, despair, and anger eat at these kids. It's a miracle any of them come out the other side in a functional manner. Which is why Precious will inspire you.ed.

B00005JO9J|4.0|It's been years since I've seen these episodes, and I have to say that I didn't like them as much as I did when they aired. I can't really pinpoint what now I don't like, but I just didn't enjoy them as much. Even though I had forgotten most of the patients I still didn't feel like I cared if they lived or died. Another problem with this season is that it is only nine episodes. Grey's was a mid season replacement in 2005 and only nine were made. Nine hours doesn't give the show a lot of time to expand it's plot lines. There are some nice plots that are introduced though, but you won't see them blossom until season 2. The actors are all excellent. They really show the pain and frustration of doctors very well. Like I said before I loved these episodes when they aired so maybe my enjoyment of the episodes is ruined because I know how these doctors are going to end up in later seasons. Maybe some of the suspense is taken away. One thing that this show is good at is showing how death is just as potent as life. There is a lot of death in this show. Sometimes a depressing amount, but it is rather riveting if you don't know what's coming. The special features are messed up on this release. All of them are on the second disc. Even the deleted scenes from episodes on the first disc are on disc two. This led me to just ignore them all together. Overall this is a nice introduction to a great series. I recommend renting this season, because as I said they were not as enjoyable the second time around. Also there are only nine episodes and [...] bucks seems a little high, even though I paid forty when they came out in 2005. I hope that the re watch of season 2 is a little more enjoyable. I will be reviewing that as well later. If you like medical dramas with some soap opera relationships, then Grey's Anatomy should be playing in your DVD player in the near future.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|And once again Hollywood proves it has run out of original ideas. Why else would they remake this movie?<br /><br />Back in 1981, when special effects were beginning to take serious root in films, we had the original [[ASIN:B000Q7ZOL2 Clash of the Titans]]. It had some cheesy claymation mixed with some less cheesy special effects. But it did have a story. A damn good one. Sure there were action sequences, especially when Perseus (Harry Hamlin) met up with Medusa. But these action scenes were barely a few minutes long. The story of the gods, how they felt about humanity (and how humanity felt about them) dominated the storyline. Yes, there was an ACTUAL story.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2010 and you get this ...this ...this mess-of-a-remake that relies almost solely on CGI and, well, basically nothing else.<br /><br />The brief understanding of the god/human relationship is thrust aside in favor of action scenes galore which have squat to do with the story. There are so many throwaway characters as to be laughable. And 3-D? For marketing purposes only. Save yourself some cash and see it in 2-D ...if at all.<br /><br />My son went with me to see it (he's as much of a movie junky as I am) and we both nearly fell asleep for lack of anything approaching a viable understanding of who was carrying the storyline. We still ask each other, \\"What was the point, again?\\"<br /><br />Sam Worthington seems to be a hot commodity in today's movie market. [[ASIN:B001FB55I0 Terminator Salvation]] and [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar]] are two of his more recent accomplishment. And although I found those two to be lukewarm in terms of story, they at least kept me engaged enough not to yawn. And Liam Neeson has also been splattered all over film posters (from [[ASIN:B001GCUNYO Taken]] to [[ASIN:B000ICLRIE Kingdom of Heaven]]). But a god? And Zeus for that matter? Not the best casting choice. He just didn't have the presence I was expecting. Perhaps the story (or lack thereof) stifled his performance. Probably.<br /><br />I also MUST caution women against seeing this if they enjoyed the strong roles in the 1981 original. You'll find no such comparisons here. There's really no good female character to be found. The closest was Alexa Davalos ([[ASIN:B001FB55JO Defiance]]) as Perseus' love interest, Andromeda. But her role is so laughably short and misunderstood that you won't care what happens to her (and things do happen).<br /><br />My final word of caution comes to those of us (all of us) struggling in today's economy. We need our escapism, and sometimes (occasionally) Hollywood allows us to have it.  But not here. You might as well sit on the toilet and release the crappen!on women against seeing this if they enjoyed the strong roles in the 1981 original. You'll find no such comparisons here.

B000UX6THK|5.0|I finally saw this after hearing years of bad press. Don't believe it. This is an exceptional journey into the weird via pure Americana. While the series conclusion is open-ended, I found it satisfying in keeping with the horror genre.  Very much worth your time.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|This album will knock your socks off if you are a big fan of 70s progressive rock.      Alan Parsons, the man who engineered Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" proves to be a fantastic songwriter/musician in his own right.  More than any other AP album, this one proves it.      It's not a record you should hear on anything other than an outstanding stereo system.  Turn it UP, too.      Not a weak song on here.  Fantastic keyboards, synths, and vocals make themselves known all over the record.      My highest recommendations go to this album!
0765350386|5.0|After so many reviews, there is no need for details, so I will just say-- It was a great story! Mistborn was engaging from the start and kept me reading with interest. I love Brandon Sanderson's writing style (although throughout the series he used \\"maladroit\\" a bit to often-- but I've noticed that quite a few authors have certain words that they use a bit to much --Robert Jordan with \\"obsequious\\" and Stephanie Meyer with \\"Chagrin\\"... just to name a few).  I would definitely recommend these books (all 3 of the series) and may read them again if I run out of new reading material.

B001NESPHC|5.0|This is great IMHO. It's too bad more of the younger gen. doesn't listen to talent like this. This girl is one and a million. She's got more talent than 99.999% of any garbage you'd hear on the radio. She's no doubt confident in her ability to perform. I get really excited when a musician writes and performs for the love of music and nothing else. I can't wait to break this out in 5 years and say to my wife \\"remember how  great this is?\\" It's one of those to us. This and Led Zeppelin's Presence lp.

B0039OGGVQ|3.0|Slash has 2 CDs prior to this one that rock like Slash is meant to rock. You can tell it is him and all the songs are great. This CD is like a Slash that decided to do the whole Santana thing to try and make some money. The songs on here are entirely generic and do not have any of Slash's edge to them. There are 2 or 3 songs that are really good...the one with Ian Astbury, Lemme and Iggy Pop. Those are rock songs that kick some butt! The other songs sound like the other singers wrote them and Slash is merely a guest to their B-side songs they didnt want to put on on of their albums. I really expected more from this CD. I have listened to it over 20 times and just still cant find the Slash in it.  Come on Slash!!!! What happened to you? I mean, Fergie??? really?

0143038419|3.0|I was taken aback by the judgmental tone of so many reviewers...saying things like our author is/was self-absorbed.  Perhaps she is/was.  But if you've ever gone through anything like divorce (regardless of the circumstances and who was to blame), it is an excruciating process during which a person can be hardly anything except self-absorbed in trying to figure out what happened and who they are after the fact.  Perhaps we could demonstrate a little compassion and understand that this is a *memoir* and a documentation of this woman's personal journey.  Further, who she is in this book is not necessarily who she will end up being.  Life is a journey.  Let's show some grace to people.  God knows we *all* need it in some way or another.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|Great concert by a great performer. George Michael performs all his hits and some Wham! classics too. Bonus disc includes a documentary...which was previously sold separately at his concert...so the fact that it's now combined with the actual concert DVD in one package is a great deal.

I think this musical is timeless and will be enjoyed by adults and children for a long time to come.

The relationship between the little boy and Ponyo are so sweet.  The little boy and his mother have a great relationship.  Ponyo's mother (Mother Goddess Ocean?) is beautiful and trusting of her daughter.  Ponyo's father is eccentric and strange, but truly cares for his daughter.  The little boy has a great relationship with the older women at the retirement center.      Great life lessons and multigenerational interacting.  Wonderful story!
0385737947|1.0|I know there are a lot of positive reviews for this book -- so maybe I'm the one up in the night -- but this book was, by and large, VERY poorly written.    Reading The Maze Runner by James Dashner is actually a somewhat strange experience. What I mean by that is usually when an author can't write well, the book -- as a product of that writing -- is simply bad. Period. But in this case, Dashner's story is actually a bit intriguing (though it's the same story device -- \\"Who am I?\\" -- found in countless videos games), and his plotting is serviceable (though he uses some weasel techniques in the plotting, especially at first, like having characters deliberately withhold information from the protagonist for no story-driven reason). So in spite of how poorly this book is written, I stuck it out to the end (only to find it's the first book in a series <sigh> -- alas, I won't be able to force myself through a second book).    One of the main problems (but by no means the only problem) is that Dashner is constantly \\"telling\\" instead of \\"showing,\\" which is a violation of one of the first rules of good writing. Indeed, even when he \\"shows\\" something, he usually feels compelled to \\"tell\\" the reader too (often at the very same time).    The characters are inconsistent. In fact they are almost schizophrenic at times (though it's not character development, just poor writing). They don't feel remotely like \\"real\\" people. Even in a fantasy -- perhaps ESPECIALLY in a fantasy -- the principle of verisimilitude is an absolute must. Unfortunately, there is a severe lack of the application of that principle in this book.    Along those lines, the \\"voice\\" of the protagonist is downright awful. It's not so much stream-of-consciousness (which at least is a real technique, if an unpleasant one) but the fact that the character's thoughts are simply a jumble (though this is also mostly not character development). His emotions bounce around in odd ways. And he repeats himself, well, repeatedly.    Perhaps the problems with this book can be summed by saying the writing itself constantly gets in the way of the storytelling, which is never a good thing.    The \\"idea\\" of The Maze Runner is okay, but unlike -- say -- an Isaac Asimov, who was an \\"idea\\" writer, and whose characters are -- by and large -- cardboard, this whole mangled mess of writing makes the characters just feel like they are the product of someone who doesn't yet know how to write very well. Almost like a bright high school kid (though Dashner is not) who has yet to come up against a skilled teacher/editor (and thus get schooled in proper technique).    Which brings up another point. In his acknowledgments Dashner mentions how one particular editor really helped him and should have co-credit on the cover of the book. Well, I don't know what exactly she did to help (or how bad the manuscript was to begin with), but I kept thinking the whole time I was reading (before I even read the acknowledgments) that what this book really needed was a strong editor to basically teach Dashner how to write competently.    This is a book from a New York publisher (and Dashner is a best-selling author of the 13th Reality Series, which I have not read). Has the skill level of those working in the publishing business truly fallen so far?    A strong editor could have done a lot with this book and with this writer. It's not that Dashner doesn't have potential. But in the end, reading The Maze Runner was a painful experience and a waste of time.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|I have never, ever felt the need so desperately to write a review on a film until I saw this one.  Sherlock Holmes is quite simply abysmal.  Everything about it is an insult to anything that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle depicted in his novels.  Anyone who has seen the UK TV series,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes starring the inimitable Jeremy Brett, will appreciate that this adaptation is utter garbage.  To feel the need to bring a classic such as Sherlock Holmes into the 21st century by totally dumbing down the plot and the characters with a totally incredulous story line is akin to remaking Gone With The Wind starring Eminem.  Right from the start, the irritating, grainy, colour-washed graphics and overcooked CGI, the mumbling dialogue and slapstick fight scenes make this a truly laughable (in a truly pathetic sense) production.  One of the most amazing features of this film is the total inability of the director to generate any sort of rapport with any of the characters!!  Genius!!  How did he do it?  My biggest regret about renting this movie was my failure to check my diary before renting this complete hogwash, as I see that I was in fact pencilled in for defuzzing my sweater collection; on reflection, an infinitely more enjoyable and rewarding experience.  I have never, ever (with the exception of suffering through another classic, Stealth) felt so cheated at the thought that I have in fact wasted 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.  If you have read any Sherlock Holmes, please take my advice, you need this film like a woodpecker needs a hangover.
B0011400OA|5.0|I have to say that I came across this book by mere chance & I'm so glad that I made the decision to buy it. For me I had alot of aha moments that I was shocked at how I was damaging my financial situation myself. the book does not only give you the know-how but it gives solutions & a brief saving plan that works so well. It delivers alot & I remember reading it like a curious child, that I finished the whole book in only 3 days & never got bored!! I'm even planning on reading it again.    I say go ahead & buy it coz its worth every penny & ur gonna love it  :)  Harv has a very unique way of writing that is so humble yet straight to the point..Its one of the best books I ever read.
B001QOGYFO|2.0|We normally like Kate Beckinsale very much .... having followed her career since HAUNTED.<br /><br />But in WHITEOUT, she seems detached and uninterested like she really did not want to make this movie.<br /><br />The scenery was very nice and the set-up to the story was well done.<br /><br />But 20 minutes into the movie, something falls apart.<br /><br />The whole plot reveals itself and they pretty much give away the whole scheme and the principle players behind it.... so for the rest of the movie you are sitting waiting for the ending that you already know is coming.<br /><br />As a result the movie has no life or energy, it just plods along and goes thru the motions.<br /><br />This happens every so often.  You have a healthy budget, good location, a good basic premise for a story and a collection of fine actors ........ all great ingredients ............ but sometimes the ingredients don't result in a satisfying dish.<br /><br />Certainly worth watching once for entertainment, but I doubt this movie will be added to many private home DVD collections and will soon be totally forgotten.

B001NXDIMK|5.0|\\"Damages\\" is one of the most creative and captivating shows on television.  The acting is outstanding, the plotting is complex and imaginative, and the characters practically leap off the screen.  Season Two is every bit as good as Season One, and the continuing appearances by William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, and Timothy Oliphant enhance the outstanding performances of the series regulars.  In a medium dominated by reality show junk and cable series, FX has hit a home run.

B002QXI2L8|5.0|The German choreographer Pina Bausch seeks to combine elements in their work. Theater, music and modern dance reflecting human feelings. This was attempted by many, but few can have a unique style. His trademark is the stage dance, several times turned to popular music, text, extreme creativity. The risk is part of your DNA, never settled, always sought innovation. His work combines despair, suffering and sorrow with the \\"warm expression of love for life.\\"     Often draws on personal biography of his dancers, forget the plot and makes the individual the center of attention. His body language is unique, incisive, provocative. This is the differential, the peculiar and creative choreographer found to produce.     Orpheus und Eurydike is your personal reading of Greek myth. Transforms the music of Christoph W. Gluck in dance, but not forget the roots of the work. The song is present in three characters, recounting the joys and anxieties of the Greek god of music in search of his beloved deceased. Each character has his double, a dancer and a singer. The singers are outstanding: Maria Ricarda Wesseling (Orpheus), Julia Kleiter (Euridike) and Im Sunhae (Love), play their characters just right. Accompany the dancers and interact with them.     The dance is the central theme, the music flows to the plot, but the steps tell the story. The distribution of the dancers on the stage is differentiated scenic. Width, depth and subgroups show the unique style of the choreographer.     Orpheus is played by Yann Bridard: the Greek god is naked, desperate search for his beloved, his lyre is the weapon. Enthralls all who are on their way with agile steps, deep, dramatic. Never expressed much smaller movements.     Love, Mitek Kudo, allows the descent into hell, a lyrical passage persongem trying to join. But the fate of man and even the gods is sealed.     Marie-Agnès Gillot is étoile dancer. His final scene shows the weaknesses and rediscover the joys of her lover, but this doesnot look for it. Dismayed, she provokes, irritates. Its motion-sensitive, sometimes brusque, sometimes fast, feminine feelings show.     Pina Bausch knows combine modern dance with traditional opera. The choreography is essential in his work, but his theatrical concept is not restricted. The light, the scenarios mirrored the colors of the costumes and silence are important in driving the plot. Choreography that creatively tells the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, without exaggerations or fabrications. The only flaw is in the subtitle: it often does not translate the text, leaving much of the work without subtitles.           PORTUGUESE:        A coreógrafa alemã Pina Bausch busca a junção de elementos em seu trabalho. Teatro, música e dança moderna refletindo os sentimentos humanos. Isso já foi tentado por muitos, mas poucos conseguem ter um estilo próprio. Sua marca registrada está na dança cênica, diversas vezes ligada à música popular, ao texto, à criatividade extrema. O risco faz parte de seu DNA, nunca se acomodou, sempre buscou a inovação. Seu trabalho combina desespero, sofrimento e tristeza com a \\"expressão calorosa de amor à vida\\".    Muitas vezes se inspira na biografia pessoal de seus bailarinos, esquece o enredo e torna o indivíduo o centro das atenções. Sua linguagem corporal é única, contundente, provocativa. Esse é o diferencial, a maneira peculiar e criativa que a coreógrafa encontrou para produzir.       Orpheus und Eurydike é sua leitura pessoal  do mito grego. Transforma a música de Christoph W. Gluck em dança, mas não esquece as raízes da obra. O canto está presente em três personagens, relatando as angústias e alegrias do deus da música grega em busca de sua amada falecida. Cada personagem tem seu duplo, um bailarino e um cantor. O cantores são exímios:  Maria Ricarda Wesseling (Orpheus), Julia Kleiter (Euridike) e Sunhae Im (Amor),  desempenham seus personagens na medida certa. Acompanham os dançarinos e  interagem com eles.    A dança é o tema central, a música flui o enredo, mas os passos contam a história. A distribuição dos  dançarinos pelo palco cênico é diferenciada. Largura, profundidade e subgrupos mostram o estílo único da coreógrafa.    Orpheus é interpretado por Yann Bridard:  o deus grego está nu, desesperado em busca de sua amada, sua lira é a arma . Enfeitiça todos que estão no seu caminho com passos ágeis, profundos, dramáticos. Nunca pequenos movimentos expressaram tanto.    Amor,  de Miteki Kudo,  permite a descida aos infernos, passagem lírica de uma persongem que tenta unir. Mas o destino do homem e até o dos deuses está selado.    Marie-Agnes Gillot é bailarina étoile.  Sua cena final mostra as fraquezas e alegrias de reencontrar seu amado,  mas este não olha para ela.  Consternada, ela provoca, irrita. Seus movimentos sensíveis, ora bruscos, ora rápidos,  demonstram sentimentos femininos.    Pina Bausch sabe conciliar dança moderna com ópera tradicional. A coreografia é essencial na sua obra, mas sua noção teatral não é restrita . A luz, os cenários espelhados, as cores dos figurinos e o silêncio são importantes na condução do enredo. Coreografia que relata com criatividade o mito de Orfeu e Eurídice, sem exageros ou invencionices. A única falha está na legendagem:  muitas vezes ela não traduz o texto, ficando boa parte da obra sem legendas.      Ali Hassan Ayache
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I come from a time when Seinfeld, Everbody Loves Raymond, and Frasier swept the Emmy's for comedy awards. Recently I was depressed by the horrible comedies on TV and was kept in the dumps watching reruns of these great oldies. Two new shows have become the new Seinfeld/ELR/Frasier: Community and Modern Family. These two shows surprise me every week with how absolutely hilarious they are! This one is for slightly older people (teen and up) mainly because younger ones won't be able to keep up with the jokes. Modern Family is the choice for a show you can watch with, well, the whole [modern] family. This is an early review so if they end up releasing this set with all 20 episodes of season one you SHOULD DEFINITELY buy it from Amazon.com. HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Okay, so I am one of the five people on the planet who has not seen the movie yet...however, I am a James Horner fan...I found out he composed the music to Avatar and I had to buy the soundtrack.<br /><br />I'll just say that this album is definitely worth getting. Horner does not use a basic ongoing theme throughout the score; rather, he uses instruments and vocals (exotic drums, tribal singing) to tie the score together - and it works fantastically.<br /><br />This album has its relaxing moments (Becoming One Of The \\"People\\") its action moments (War) and its 'Horner is a flipping genius' moments (Jake's First Flight). Crank up 'Jake's First Flight' on a stereo system and tell me you wasted money on this album. 'Jake's First Flight' is the greatest movie composition I have ever heard...I am not exaggerating when I write this - listen to it and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />This album is simply amazing. It ties together Horner's trademark sound with an exotic twist - creating a masterpiece of a score.<br /><br />5/5
1596063009|3.0|I heard so much praise for this book/series that I figured I had to give it a try.  Given that I'm a big fan of solid character building and realistically dreary storyline, I thought this would be right up my alley.    In all aspects that I heard were so great, this book was just okay.  The characters seemed to be anti-cliche', or different for the sake of being different.  They were interesting to a point, but the characterization was nothing next to what I was led to expect.  Truly great authors (Martin, Hobb) know how to build a character from scratch, Abercrombie seems to only be able to turn an existing character on their head.  The only one that really captured my attention was the first of the Magi, but he didn't have a huge role.    The action was solid, but a lot of it felt forced.  This is especially true of the climax, which seemed to only have happened because Abercrombie thought the ending needed an excessively long, excessively violent action scene.  I felt the entire sequence could have been skipped and nothing would be lost from the story.      In the end, I suppose this is an entertaining enough story, but nothing about it impressed me.  Perhaps I came in with too-high hopes, but I was disappointed.

B002S0OBMS|1.0|**SOME SPOILERS**    This idea came more from the book Phantom of Manhattan. If they wanted to make a sequel, they should have had the phantom get over Christine and find someone else. In POTO, Christine is more afraid and repulsed by what he looks like underneath the mask. Raoul loved Christine very much and rescued her in POTO. Why they made him into a drunk and uncaring father for Gustav is beyond me. When did the Phantom and Christine get together? This whole idea of Gustav being the Phantom's son just doesn't fit. Many things about the sequel do not fit and why turn Meg Giry into something so wrong at the end? It seems to me that this would fit more with the Gerard Butler film than the broadway show. I just can't love this sequel the way I love the original.

B00004Y6NU|5.0|'Love Over Gold', the fourth album from Dire Straits, is unquestionably one of the band's strongest efforts.  It is easily on a par with 'Brothers In Arms' and is slightly superior to its predecessor 'Making Movies' and also the live set 'Alchemy' which followed it.    Excellent instrumentals and very strong lyrics are present throughout 'Love Over Gold'.  Produced by Mark Knopfler whose guitar playing is superb throughout, and  drummer Pick Withers is also on top form (this was his last album with the group).     There is not a weak moment on the album and every track rates a mention.  The album opens with what is one of the band's best songs of all time, the epic 'Telegraph Road', the lyrics of which tell the sad story of the decline of an industrial town.  'Private Investigations' was the big hit of the album, at least in the UK where it hit # 2 in the charts, regardless of its 7 minute length (the highest position Dire Straits ever achieved in the singles charts in their home country).  'Industrial Disease' was a hit in Canada, and Knopfler's lyrics are witty.  Next is the title track of the album, the definitive version being the original 6 minute track found here with a solo performance by Knopfler on acoustic guitar at the end (a rather inferior live version unfortunately found its way onto most Dire Straits compilations apart from the most recent one, 'The Best of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations' released in 2005). The last track 'It Never Rains' is another masterpiece. Clocking in at almost 8 minutes, it starts off fairly quietly, before becoming more dramatic midway through, and toward the end it really takes off with a superb guitar solo from Knopfler.    Although there are only five tracks on the album there is over 41 minutes of playing time. This is almost as progressive rock as Dire Straits ever got.  The album is sometimes dark, but is easily up there with their best.  Thoroughly recommended.
0805091742|4.0|The Checklist Manifesto examines how a group of people, each skilled in their area, can work together to create a good outcome at a complex task. Modern medicine is one such complex area. Many patients are treated by multiple specialists. Operations performed by skill teams sometimes fail for seemingly trivial reasons. One possible solution is to use checklists. Apparently doctors need convincing of this.    The Checklist Manifesto is well written. Gawande smoothly moves from medical anecdotes to examples from other fields. He incorporates several examples from construction and aviation.    The construction examples show how disparate teams with related skills can coordinate. The aviation examples show how checklist can be used by skill practitioners to do the right thing in a crisis. Both show how a huge number of details can be tracked accurately. Aviation and medical examples are used to show how difficult it is to get the checklists right.    In the end the thesis seems rather obvious to me, but perhaps that is because I am not a doctor. Gawande seems to be trying to convince a skeptical audience of something that should be beyond question. I hope he succeeds.

0316010669|5.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Blink\\".  The whole issue as to whether or not we are \\"robots\\", and the nature of our \\"programming\\" and \\"input-output behavior\\", can be seen very starkly in sitting at the \\"closed door\\", as Gladwell describes the interface between environment and brain.  One can illuminate much in considering the \\"trendy\\" subjects that occupy us:  science, technology, war, politics, racism and sexism.  I like the manner in which he criticizes, with an edge of objectivity, and appears to expose weakness, and yet displays a balancing compassion.  He handled the case of the autistic person in a particularly sensitive manner which I appreciated, as a mathematician, since so many good mathematicians seem to be at least borderline autistic.  Having myself been mistaken sometimes as having Asperger's syndrome, I could relate quite personally to what he described.  Ultimately, we do not currently understand how to open that \\"closed door\\", but it is quite fascinating to sit at that edge that separates us from the inner life of the brain and the rest of the world.<br />Much of the work seemed to be speculative, without a focused scientific basis, or rigorous theory.  I can see that the numerous connections drawn in the course of developing these ideas could seem tenuous or superficial.  One sees the overall connection converging on the \\"closed door\\" (more a metaphor than a true dichotomy between the inner workings of the mind and the external world), and just as with contemplating the significance of the event horizon of a black hole, one is aware that this is a crucial meeting point of disparate theories.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|I was pleased with the process of purchasing this product until my daughter opened the sealed package for her birthday.  I guess I should have realized when I wrapped it that there was no stickers to remove as usual on the Disney movies.  This seems like a copy instead of an actual new dvd.  The booklet was in pieces inside and although the dvd looks good on the surface when we played it our player was acting like it does when we watch a burned dvd.  All in all our daughter loves the movie so it works out for us...not what I thought I was purchasing though.
B0035G9ABG|3.0|When I first got this CD and popped it into my computer to give it a listen, I wasn't impressed. The songs seemed forgettable, repetitive, and it just seemed like a just above mediocre CD. In a state of shock, I listened to it again on my iPod, and while it still wasn't my favorite CD, I found more little things I liked about it. I just kept listening to it to find more things that they put in there, and after a while, it became brilliant in my mind. Now, before I begin my analysis, I think you should know what the Gorillaz are. I'm not going to put a big description and waste space here, so just look them up on Wikipedia. Here we go!    1. Orchestral Intro: This is a nice little tune, I felt kind of like I was looking at a beach covered in syringes, plastic bags and other crap. Good show, Jamie/Damon.  2. Welcome to The World of The Plastic Beach: This is not a good way to start out the vocal songs. I guess the melody is fine, just really sleepy. And that seemed to have an effect on Snoop Doggy Dawg. I have a feeling he just crashed on the studio doorstep, and Damon Albarn just but him front of a mic with a lyric sheet, for him to speak at whatever point he wanted. Maybe I'm going a little harsh on him, but I'm just not fond of the track.  3. White Flag: I like this song. The rapping is really entertaining, and the flute(?) section sounds really cool. The backing beat, I could like more. It sounded like a drum looping machine. Still a very cool track, though.  4. Rhinestone Eyes: The first track with 2D/Damon's vocals. Finally! If you think he speak-sings in his other songs, you'll think he's just talking in this one. Frankly, I thought that it was a very good choice. A beautiful, calming song.  5. Stylo: There is some Controversy about this track. They have been accused of stealing the beginning of the song from Eddy Grant's 'Time Warp'. The tracks are similar for that part, although I'm not sure that 3 notes warrant a lawsuit. Regardless, I thought this was probably the best track all around, but the vocals were absolutely outstanding. Bobby Womack, Mos Def, and of course Damon were all really into the song. Also, the music video is quite nice. Shame it did not come with the 'Experience' edition.  6. Superfast Jellyfish: THis is the Weirdest track, and you can decide for yourself if that's good or not. I loved it, starting out like a breakfast commercial, and then getting deep-voiced rappers to sing about how much they love this treat for breakfast, and the little toys that come with it. Genius!  7. Empire Ants: This track starts out about as excited as a nerd having to sit through Batman and Robin. It starts off like another 'WTTWOTPB', but it gets better when Little Dragon joins in. Still a sleepy track, but ore interesting. At this point I realized the album had a recurring theme of a 'system', or 'machine'. Possibly representing an independent government being established? I don't know, all I know that this is just a fair track.  8. Glitter Freeze: This was my favorite track when I first heard the CD online (legally, mind you). But now it just sound like a lot of sirens. Bland.  9. Some Kind of Nature: People already seem to loving this one. And it's certainly a great song. It's another weird one like Jellyfish, but it fits in with the calm and worried feel of the other songs.  10. On Melancholy Hill: THis is another popular one, but I don't really understand what instruments they used for that warping sound that would be in teen pop songs back around 2000-2004. That doesn't make it a bad song, it just makes me think about listening to the radio back then.  11. Broken: This one sticks in my head sometimes, but there's nothing much to say. It's a good, but not great song.  12. Sweepstakes: I liked this song on my initial listening too, but I don't resent it as much as Glitter Freeze. It's pretty much just Mos Def chanting/rapping to a drum-machine, and unlike most Gorillaz songs it feels like you're not gaining anythingfrom it. It just doesn't work.  13. Plastic Beach: Ah, the title song. The one that is expected to be a hit by piggybacking off of he CD's name, but really just ends up being a B-Side. THis is no exception to that. 'Casio on the Plastic Beach'? Really? That's the chorus?  14. To Binge: Sounds like we're getting back on track! How many songs are left? ...2? Whatever. I enjoy this track. While the 'drum machine' songs suffered from their simplicity, this one actually exceeds expectations from it. It's like a folk song, and Little Dragon is fantastic again. I'll have to see what they've released.  15. Cloud of Unknowing: Bobby Womack, you seem really talented. But I'm not sure that this is the best song for you. It's not that you're bad! It's just that this sounds kind of like an old man reminiscing about a song from his youth. You're still great.  16. Pirate Jet: This one sounds more like the Gorillaz from Demon Days. It's a nice way to end the CD, but I'm not sure how I would have felt if it was placed somewhere else.    So there you have it! A solid effort from Gorillaz, if not as good as Demon Days. Looking forward to the music videos!    EDIT: I've spent even more time with this, and I have to say, it's not worth the money to buy the \\"Experience\\" version. I expected to get exclusive streaming events, but all I got was a digital booklets, some desktops, and a cool screensaver. Album gets an 8.5, the DVD and experience drag it down to a 6.

055380684X|4.0|I had always heard that lots of practice is required to be good at anything. Now neuroscientists have used Functional magnetic resonance imaging to show how the brain changes when we practice. A substance called Myelin coats neurons that are used for a particular task. The more you practice the thicker that coat gets. This increases performance at that task.     The Talent Code is one of a recent spate of books that basically explicate the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson's work on expertise. He is the source of the idea that it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at anything. [[ASIN:1591842948 Talent Is Overrated]] is another in this genre.    The Talent Code is the best written of the books and articles I have read in this vein. It is very well written and his large selection of examples and anecdotes are entertaining and enlightening.    Coyle focuses more on the need for good mentors and coaches. He looks for what ignites the passion which causes someone to persist with the deliberate practice that is necessary to make talent bloom and become an expert.    This book may not help you become great at anything, but it might help you recognize talent in your children. It is also worth reading to understand what creates the talent and greatness we sometime see in others.

0307454541|3.0|To this book, I want to say, \\"Enough already!\\"  I've been intrigued by this book for a long time.  It's been at the front of every book story, has an interesting title and a hip and inticing cover.  I resisted buying it.  A few months ago the paperback version turned up in the clubhouse library and I snapped it up before anyone else could have it.  Selfishly it sat on my shelf until now.<br /><br />The story of Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist and his unlikely assistant Lisbeth Salander made for an interesting tale.  Coupled with a wealthy and reclusive family headed by Henrik Vanger.  Henrik hires Mikael to solve a forty year old murder of his niece, Harriet.  In doing so Mikael and Lisbeth reveal vile and repulsive family secrets.<br /><br />I finished this book at about page 450.  The remaining 150 pages were unnecessary and didn't add, in my mind, to the story.  The entire part about Blomkvist getting revenge on his rival had no meaning in the context of the rest of the story.  Lisbeth had so many unfinished parts to her life story, I was left unfulfilled.<br /><br />Now I know the author has written sequels to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but these characters didn't thrill me enough to drool over the titles the next time I visit the bookstore.  I rate this book 3 out of 4.  I'll return it to the clubhouse library where it belongs.<br /><br />Linda C. Wright<br />Author, One Clown Short<br />[[ASIN:1439249563 One Clown Short]]

B000K4WPCM|3.0|This gothic overtoned movie is first and foremost a teen movie, and then secondly has some supernatural thriller elements.  If approached on that basis, it's quite passable and indeed quite slick in it's production.  The story is Twilight - lite, but transposed to the world of witches rather than vampires, and with far less teen-angst.  Four teenage friends in Ipswich hold a secret - they are actually descendents of witches, and have special powers.. powers which are magnified when they reach their 18th birthday.  However, the powers come at a terrible cost.  Two newcomers to the private school they attend make things complicated - a beautiful woman (mmhh.. wonder what happens there, then...) and another schoolboy - who turns out to have a link to the other 4.  The hero finds himself having to choose what to tell the lady about his secret - and just maybe he will have to make a decision... his powers, or the girl.  It's not rocket science, and holds few surprises.   The cast are all standard eye candy Hollywood teens, the school seemingly entirely populated by perfect specimens.  The production looks glossy but is brilliantly clear in this bluray transfer - The dark scenes (and there are plenty of those) are crystal clear, the condensation in the obligatory \\"woman-feels-like-she-is-being-watched-in-the-shower\\" scene actually feels real, and the few special effects scenes - the car crashing into the truck, for example, are just vivid enough in HD in sight and sound to help wake you up just when you are getting bored with the dragging plot.  Watch out for the surprisingly convincing cgi spider.  The ending feels more like a set up for a sequel than a satisfying resolution in itself, but overall if you're not expecting much - there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours.  Movie making by numbers, perhaps - but the numbers add up to passable if unsurprising entertainment.

B0000033IR|5.0|\\"Lady Soul\\" is a high-quality reissue of one of Aretha Franklin's greatest, most important records, dating from 1968, the midst of the most hit-filled period of her career. It was her third highly successful, gritty album for Atlantic: She had ten Top Ten hits in eighteen months of 1967-68.  \\"Lady Soul\\" peaked at #1, #2 and #3 on Billboard's Black Albums, Pop Albums and Jazz Albums charts respectively.<br /><br />Franklin is the daughter of an influential Detroit preacher and her talent was recognized early; she cut her first record at 14. She was later signed to Columbia, a find of their legendary talent scout John Hammond, but the label didn't seem to know what to do with her. However, Atlantic waited in the wings. Once signed by their chief Ahmet Ertegun, producers Jerry Wexler and Arif Mardin, and engineer Tom Dowd put her together with a repertory better suited to her soulful talents, and backed her explosive song stylings with the equally explosive Muscle Shoals studio players (though they were then feuding with that studio's management, and had to bring the musicians to New York to record). And they all made music history. Franklin almost immediately burst onto the Rhythm and Blues charts with Otis Redding's \\"Respect,\\" still her biggest hit, though she was to have 20 R&B #1 singles.<br /><br />This album is a no-brainer purchase, containing her mega hits \\"Chain of Fools,\\" \\"People Get Ready,\\" and \\"You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman,\\" plus several more memorable takes that show her at her very best.<br /><br />But Franklin, also honored as the Queen of Soul, is a triple-threat singer-songwriter-pianist, and she isn't limited to soul and R&B; she can also do gospel, for sure, jazz, and even, memorably, opera. There was the night she stepped in for the ailing Luciano Pavarotti at the live Grammy Awards, and, without rehearsal time, nor even time to get the aria transposed to her key, she delivered a version of the opera singer's signature aria, \\"Nessun Dorma,\\" from \\"Turandot,\\" that brought the jaded music crowd to its feet. She's won awards and honors too numerous to mention, including an unprecedented eight consecutive Grammies for Best Female R&B vocal performance from 1967-1974-- there were people jokingly referring to it, finally, as Grammy's Aretha Award. She does sometimes remind me of something a choir master supposedly once said to a little girl: you don't have to sing so loud, God can always hear you. But this woman deserves all our R-E-S-P-E-C-T, and this album dates from her never quite equaled early burst of creativity. It belongs on the shelf of her serious fans.brought the jaded music crowd to its feet.

0452284392|4.0|Linked is a fascinating introduction to graph theory and power of network analysis.<br />Repetitive sometimes, self aggrandizing in parts, but a very interesting book nonetheless.<br /><br />There are several 1-star reviews from people who seem to intensely dislike the author. While they are right (about the book lacking in technical detail) or being too focused on author's own studies, the book still serves as a really exciting introduction to graph theory/network theory/power laws in networks.<br /><br />I particularly like chapter 14 (which shows how we can be prone to a financial crisis because of cascading failures) and Chapter 9 (which is a basic introduction to how networks can be vulnerable to attacks). The book is clearly ahead of its times and, in a way, predicts attacks by Chinese hackers on Google (and many other countries/companies) and financial crisis of 2008.<br /><br />My bottom line - It worked for me despite my Electrical Engineering degree (and the courses I took on Graph Theory) and my understanding of power laws and statistics.

This is the story of a small fish who escapes from the submarine of her father (a sea-wizard) and happens to taste a drop of blood from a young boy and becomes human-like for a while. The boy, Sosuke, names her Ponyo, and the main story is all about the friendship and love that develops between the two of them (and Ponyo's fondness of all things human, like ham sandwiches, of all things). But their relationship also disrupts the natural balance between sea and land, and disasters in the form of floods and a typhoon loom to threaten everyone, not just the innocent friends. So the story is not just about a developing friendship, but the responsibilities that come along with that, to the people in the fishing village, to the elderly people in the retirement home (where Sosuke's mother works), to the creatures in the ocean, and beyond that to the planet itself. All, of course, is resolved in the end.    Beyond the story, however, Ponyo has some of the most amazing animation scenes, especially of the raging waves that lash the shore in a typhoon, coming alive into wild creatures of fury. I thought this might not translate so well to a smaller screen, but I was not disappointed. The disc is really a beautiful rendering. You can turn down the sound and still have a fine time simply viewing the animation, one beautiful image after the other.     Some who've seen Miyazaki movies before may get a sense of deja vu - Ponyo seems a lot like Mai from Totoro,  the Sea Wizard seems a lot like Miyazaki's other long-nosed European-ish characters in Howl's Moving Castle, and there are many other similarities too numerous to mention. But what do you expect - it's the same artists doing the drawing (and yes, this is hand drawn animation at its best), so you'd expect some stylistic similarities. But there is enough new here to surprise and delight, and if you've neverseen a Miyazaki movie before, then it will all be new.     The one thing I dislike is the silly English translation of the theme song at the end, so I greatly appreciate that the disc retains the original Japanese soundtrack, where the original is much more appropriate.  The extras on the 2nd disc are nice for Miyazaki fans, but it's the movie itself that is the real value here.
B00003CXXS|1.0|This review is from: Jurassic Park Adventure Pack (Jurassic Park/ The Lost World: Jurassic Park/ Jurassic Park III) (DVD)  - I do NOT \\"recommend\\" the Jurassic Park III DVD 2001, collector's Edition.     My friend 1st bought me the Package Edition, but I discovered in JP III some IDIOT played sound god & turned the action up & down.    So, I bought the original 2001 version.  Same thing!!!  In Jurassic Park III the Sound in a LOT of scenes of the DVD is LOUSY!   The VHS of it was FINE. When the sound gets LOUD in the DVD of JP III some idiot sound god turns it down.  When Tea Leoni screams, some idiot sound god turns it down.  After that they turn it back up.  Up, down, up, down.  VERY ANOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      This TOTALLY ruined Jurassic Park III DVD that I got for my birthday! I'll go back to my VHS of it. IT was FINE!     LEAVE THE DAMN SOUND ALONE WHEN YOU MAKE ANYTHING! WE have fingers that can turn it down on OUR controller if it's too loud!!!!!!!!!!    What's the matter with you idiots, anyway.  In car crash, vampire, alien, etc. movies you leave it just fine. Well, LEAVE MY JURASSIC PARK III DVD'S ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1572705329|5.0|One of the better audiobook readings of any Austen novel. Prunella Scales is particularly fine at delineating the voices of the various characters: the forthright and sensible Mr Knightley, the self-satisfaction of Emma, the tremulous old-womanish Mr Woodhouse, and the silliness of Harriet Smith, are all definitely and exactly given utterance. The dialogue has all the crack and vivacity you could ask for.    However, Scales is slightly less convincing in the author's own voice. She doesn't always fully characterize the many distinctions the author makes but her reading still remains on the happy side of neutrality because it never intrudes: it understates rather than obscures the point of Austen's writing. Even so, delicate reticence is always more welcome than brazen misreading of which, alas, many examples abound.
B000AP04OM|5.0|\\"The Sound of Music\\" is rightly a perpetual favorite among movie fans.  It took home five Academy Awards after its 1965 release, and continues to thrill audiences today with its superb musical performances, its touching story, and its fabulous location shooting in Austria.  This 40th anniversary two-disk edition offers a sharp, beautiful digitally remastered presentation, and loads of extras.<br /><br />The story is familiar to fans.  Once upon a time (in 1938), in the City of Salzberg deep in the Austrian Alps, a spirited young postulate named Maria is sent from her covent to be governess to the seven unruly children of a widowed and very strict Captain Von Trapp. Through pluck, compassion, and her ability to share her music, she captures the hearts of the children and enables them to re-capture the heart of their father.<br /><br />The movie has two climaxes.  The first comes when Maria and Captain Von Trapp must confront their unexpected feelings for each other.  The second comes when the Nazi take-over of Austria puts the Von Trapp family at risk.  In a thrilling conclusion, the family must dodge a Nazi dragnet and flee for their lives.<br /><br />The extras for this edition are quite remarkable, including the usual \\"making of\\" features that detail the lengthy backstory of the movie and the musical stage production that preceded it.  Co-stars Jule Andrews (Maria) and Christopher Plummer (Captain Von Trapp) provide delightful commentary.  Perhaps most interesting to this reviewer was the reunion of the actors who played the seven Von Trapp children.  They have some interesting stories about the long production of the movie in California and Austria.  Rehearsals and filming ran for months, during which the two boys grew several inches, two of the younger girls shed teeth, and all contributed to pranks and gaffs on and off set.<br /><br />\\"The Sound of Music\\" is very highly recommended as superb family entertainment that has stood the test of time and is even better in this refurbished edition.
B000MLNUBI|2.0|Bought a Body and Soul \\"special\\" edition, of course more expensive and in Europe. Lasted about 2 years.  It says 30 meters, but the crown is not screwed down.  Once in a while there is rain.  The crown eventually froze and when trying to turn it broke off.  I loved my swatch, it was beautiful, wouldn't have traded it for the more expensive automatics.  Tried to get it fixed by Swatch USA in New Jersey; they would not help me because I bought it from a dealer and not from Swatch.  Tried to get it fixed at Tourneau in NYC, they won't touch it but did not tell me why.  Tried to fix it at a nice shop recommended by Tourneau but it would cost about $500 to fix.  Sorry, this swatch is not even rain resistant.  It is beautiful though.

B000W07EKW|5.0|Of course they're great movies, everyone knows that.  But what i thought is more important for people to know is that anyone you write a check to can use your routing and account numbers to charge things on Amazon.  This happened to me twice a couple years ago, and since I did not have an Amazon account at the time, they didn't care at all.  So now I have an Amazon account just to make sure I can talk to someone at Amazon if this happens again.  And I figured since they want to clutter up my mailbox begging for a review, I'd speak my mind.  And going farther into this review process, I see they want to make sure I sign with more personal information.  Beware of these people.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is the \\"movie\\" of all time; the grandaddy of all! The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Avitar, and Dr. Strangelove( I am sure there are others) all copied from Metropolis, the end result is that Metropolis uses intelect, not science and technology to prove it's greatness. What you have is around 25 minutes of restored footage, which is in 16 MM print. Fritz Lang wanted the movie uncut, and except for about five minutes stil missing; you have a mastrpiece ful of intellect and genius. The musical score is what Fiz Lang wanted not a different musical score but what is presented as a \\"close to finished product\\"<br />This is a wondrful masterpiece and perhaps the finest movie ever made! This review is for the \\"Complete Meropolis\\" not the restored version which while great is missing the 25 minutes of restored footage in 16 MM print!

B002VECMAO|5.0|THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS<br /><br />STARRING: Ewan McGregor, George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Lang, Robert Patrick, Waleed Zuaiter, Stephen Root, Glenn Morshower, Tim Griffin, Jacob Browne and Rebecca Mader<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Peter Straughan; based on the book by Jon Ronson<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Grant Heslov<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Comedy<br />Release Date: 06 November 2009<br /><br />Although I enjoyed it a great deal, the initial feeling I was left with after seeing The Men Who Stare at Goats was a negative one. As did I, one could very easily mistake the point of the film to be anti-American or anti-Military. DON'T. After a joyous second viewing, I was pleased to discover that I was wrong. The film is a ridiculous satire. If anything, it's poking fun at the book on which it's based.<br /><br />George Clooney has delivered yet another outstanding performance in one of three of 2009's best films. I like the man more and more with everything I see him do. All three of his films from `09 (Up in the Air, Fantastic Mr. Fox and of course this one) were hilarious comedies; but they differ from one another in vast proportions. If you haven't, make an effort to see them all!<br /><br />Here Clooney plays my favorite character in the film, Lyn Cassady. Lyn honestly believes with all his heart that he has psychic powers and capabilities to do the unthinkable on numerous levels. This is all explained to us and to Ewan McGregor's character, Bob Wilton, early on in a hotel room in Kuwait back in 2003.<br /><br />Bob is a reporter who has just been left by his wife for his one-armed editor. He flees to Kuwait with high hopes of crossing the border into Iraq after the war has just kicked off, for a chance at a big story. Lyn is his golden ticket. After hearing about Lyn via an even nuttier source, (if that's even possible), Bob is ecstatic when he runs into Lyn. Bob's fruit-loop of a source explained that he and Lyn had been trained to kill animals via staring at them for prolonged periods of time. The United States Army had trained them to do so, and Lyn Cassady was the best there ever was at performing this preposterous endeavor.<br /><br />In addition to killing animals with hours on end of staring, Lyn explains that he was a member of `The New Earth Army.' According to the book and the audio commentaries on the DVD, there is some truth to this group existing, although it was in fact titled something slightly less interesting. Mainly other than this, and a few of the conversations that take place between Bob and Lyn being portrayed word for word; most of the film is strictly Hollywood's innovative twist on the truth.<br /><br />Lyn further explains to Bob, that while enrolled in The New Earth Army, he was also trained how to interrupt someone's thought pattern; telekinetically of course.<br /><br />The film takes Bob, and cleverly makes that character us as audience members. More than anything else, it's out of sheer bewildered curiosity that Bob wants to tag along with Lyn, into Iraq. Lyn allows him to do so, after he sees some of the `Jedi' in Bob. The Jedi is what those of The New Earth Army would often refer to themselves as. The term Jedi as you may recall, stems from the Star Wars franchise, which evidently Bob has never seen, as Ewan McGregor appeared in the first three episodes. Contrary to popular belief, this was coincidental according to the filmmakers. But it provides us with a warm laugh when we see the scene, nonetheless.<br /><br />There is a segment in the film that will cause you to uncontrollably fill your shoes with urine, due to a fit of insane laughter. Clooney's facial expressions are a riot, as he attempts to `cloud burst' some clouds while driving. Bob stares at him wide eyed, as he explains that by using his mind, he can cause clouds to burst into bits of clouds. One such cloud just so happens to do so and `there you have it', says Clooney's expression. The purpose of this technique is never revealed by Lyn.<br /><br />One of the things that makes the film so gut-wrenchingly funny, is that Lyn is often so satisfied that he has proven his powers to  Bob, when he has in fact done no such thing. For instance, there is a scene where he attempts to show Bob that he can get inside his head and mentally disarm Bob from causing harm to him. He physically knocks Bob down and then triumphantly says, \\"See? I barely moved. Physics wise not much going on here. It's the psychic energy that's important.\\" If you have ever met someone like Lyn, the film will be an entertaining reminder of such an exhilaratingly bizarre encounter.<br /><br />The third act has our adventures with Bob and Lyn, eventually lead to interactions with two more appreciated characters that we hear much about and see in a few flashbacks throughout the film. Jeff Bridges plays the hippie-ish originator of The New Earth Army, Bill Django; and Kevin Spacey is the envy-fuelled villain, as Larry Hooper. Somehow, things get even more hysterical and out of control when these two outlandish beings are thrown into the mix. Hallucinogenic drugs, tanks, childish revenge, semi-automatic rifles, an act of heroic courage, and helicopters are involved, and it couldn't have been any more amusing.<br /><br />Bob's character is based on the writer of the book, Jon Ronson. Having listened to this man on one of the commentary tracks, I can tell you that much like his characters; he's a little out there to say the least. The filmmakers obviously didn't take him too seriously either, as they miss-spelled his name on the end credits, which he points out at the end of the commentary track. Another appealing element to the film is the fact that Jon Ronson doesn't seem to be aware that the film is basically a mockery of his book. At least it was in my eyes.<br /><br />There are several more Jedi `powers' that I didn't mention; a major one in particular that I'll leave for you to find. Just don't take the ending to mean that Bob literally performs it.so gut-wrenchingly funny, is that Lyn is often so satisfied that he has proven his powers to  Bob, when he has in fact done no such thing.

B0000E6I1J|5.0|Outstanding is all I can say. Never realized how talent George Harrison was until I saw the DVD. Recommend it to everyone!
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I took my children to see this movie on the big screen and worried that it might not hold the attention of my 7 and 11 year old children.  It seems suitable for younger kids, on par with My Neighbor Totoro.  It is about a little boy who befriends a sea princess.  In Little Mermaid fashion, her desire to stay on land leads to danger and peril.  Ultimately there is a happy ending.  However both of my girls were entranced and begged me to purchase the DVD, which I did.  I sprung for the Blu-Ray because the visuals are gorgeous, especially scenes of the sea - both underwater and churning over the land.  This is a worthy addition to the Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli line.  Thoroughly enjoyable for children and adults.

B002N1AF7C|5.0|Kraftwerks, \\"Autobahn\\", is one of the first of its kind being one of the first albums by a group of muscisan to employ electronic elements some of which they pioneered themselves and made the use of other electrnoic instruments that werent even availible to the public yet. Containing vocoded vocals, minimoogs and more this albums contained sound which up to its release had not been heard before and was way, way ahead of its time back in 1974 making something that was a true innovation in music and the impact of this album and others by Kraftwerk is still being experienced today. But, for all the new sounds that this album contains it is not an entirely electronic album since it still contains insruments like the flute, guitar and piano but nonetheless a maijor innovation and Kraftwerks first concept album that of being the experience of the autobahn and so forth.<br /><br />Autobah: Spanning at a length of over 22 minutes long the influence for this first track and was intened to recreate the experience they felt when driving on the autobahn. The rhythym of this song is actullay based on the rhythyms they heard from cars in motion. The centerpoint of this album the only non electronic instrument this song employs is a flute which fits in amazingly with the other electronic instruments. It is also the first Kraftwerk track to contain vocals as well but is mainly instrumental. It contains an array of electronic instruments from distorted magnificent sweeps of synthesizers to blissful waves of flute all the way to rhythmic patterns of electrnoic drums the sounds of which had never been heard before whatsoever all in all this song was a maijor leap in the bounds of sound and the realm of popular music and simply music in general.<br /><br />Kometen Melodie 1: Running at a seemingly short length of 6 minutes long this song is a very ambient texture of synthesizer not really containing to much of a melody as the title insists but could possibly one of the first songs recorded that could be called ambient or be considered to contain an ambience of sorts.<br /><br />Kometen Melodie 2: Now this track is much more of a melody than the previous one. At first it starts off the same way but then launches into a bright synthesizer melody with an upbeat drum beat that sort of sounds like the Beach Boys except without vocals or guitar and the guitar being transformed into a synthesizer melody.<br /><br />Mitternacht: This track unlike the previous two doesent follow any musical thing whatsoever and even though it only spans at being 3 or so minutes in length is a complete distortion and experimentation in sound the likes of which could of possibly came from the so called electronic symphonies of Stockhaussen<br /><br />Morgenspaziergang: Employing the full use of guitar, piano, and flute and is almost all non electrnoic except for the fact it contains a sort of backtrack that seems to of been some sort of synthesizer or tape effect but either way it gives this track a very sort of surrealistic blissful feeling to it and almost sounds like the rising of the sun in the early hours of the morning. It contains very light strums of a guitar that sound sort of Asian combined with a mellow piano melody being playing while flourishes of flute spread amongst these sounds in a way that is great.<br /><br />Though Kraftwerk are not the first artists to ever employ electronic sounds before they are one of the first ever to combine it with music and realease it in album format causing reprecussions on popular music that are still being felt today.d be called ambient or be considered to contain an ambience of sorts.

B00337KM2S|4.0|Ryan Bingham is a man who lives in a `cocoon of self banishment' as he is described by a fellow worker. He is away on the road for about 322 days of the year working for a company that is hired to tell people that they have lost their jobs and helping them with the transition. Such is his isolation that he does not believe in marriage or love and is becoming alienated from his family of siblings. He is also a motivational speaker who travels on various speaking engagements and goads people to consider what is important to them. Life is smooth for the solitary man. Until.....<br />He meets Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) who is road warrior like him. They meet and both become attracted to each other. On the professional front, Bingham's company has just hired a grad school rookie who wants to embark on some cost cutting and do the work of firing people by teleconferencing. Ryan realizes that his dream of attaining a million frequent flier miles will be broken, so he takes this upstart Natalie on a cross country jaunt to teach her the ropes with the intention of showing her that firing people in person is better than through the internet. On this journey Ryan learns some important lessons about life, love and family<br />Jason Reitman directs this great film and I think this one is his best after Thank you for smoking and Juno. George Clooney is great, I loved him in the scene when he discovers Alex's true colors  and his advice to his to be brother in law on his sister's wedding day.<br />Vera Farmiga and Clooney have great chemistry together and they are ably supported by Anna Kendrick. I loved this movie and gave it four stars. 4/7/10

B002O4J4DO|5.0|I have all these tracks in storage (all my 45rpms)& glad to see the singles released exactly the way they were without being common stereo versions. Every number is a classic except the two oddball tracks that I have as well in my collection. This one like the Three Dog Night mono mixes sound absolutely great!(those are found on a few releases as well) this is the way I grew up hearing and buying records. I know, why not stereo, get the albums or the many \\"Best Of\\" collections if your looking for the album versions heard on FM radio. What I really liked was the fact that the \\"B\\" sides were sometimes every bit as good as the \\"A\\" side of the single. So if you have the cash and really want to hear the band like I did when they were together, then this is the ticket. Remember though, being in mono they will sound better playing in your car or a small portable stereo. My high end system is better playing the stereo recording from the albums. Anyone over 40 I highly recommend this collection, if you like the band and are under 30, it might be a disappointment because of the mono format. Anyway, I am happy with it as other reviewers.<br />Check my website out sometime and say \\"Hi\\" at \\"Judemac Forever\\" Google it.
075640407X|4.0|I found the book to be a good read- with an engaging storyline and quite well written, if you enjoy Robin Hobb's books, especially the Assasin's Apprentice series, I think you would like this. I am not usually a big Fantasy novel fan, but I really enjoyed this story and thought it was a lot less \\"scenery chewy\\" than a lot of fantasy type novels. Can't wait for the next one!
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I was fortunate to have received the right copy on my first buy. Watched both versions (blu-ray) and must admit I do like the Swedish version better. Both need to be viewed to see how some of the translation was changed in the English/Swedish version. One part when playing it in English in the beginning of the movie Eli enters her appt. and mentions that it is too bright and Hakan says he will cover the window where as the Swedish you just see Oscar listening w/no subtitles showing what was said. Not a major flaw but you can see the little differences both versions have. Purchased the novel after reading some of the reviews stating what was left out in the movie although there are hints in the movie pointing some of those out. This movie is a coming of age,romance,revenge thriller you won't soon forget. A must have in any dvd library.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Highly recommend!! This book was very well-written and informative without being \\"overly scientific\\".  I say that because judging from the author's high level of education in this field, I was concerned that there would be more of a research/fact focus.  I was very happy to be so wrong. It was a wonderful book that I could not put down. Telling the story from the patient's viewpoint was brilliant.  That approach made me feel the urgency of the need for research and treatment in early-onset alzheimer's.  Poignant, touching, profound...I was sad when the book ended.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Sherlock Holmes was a very entertaining film for the end of 2009. Guy Ritchie directed a very good cast that worked well together and made the story more fun. Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. were a good Holmes & Watson but definitely not the all time best. The film was fun and engaging just as I expected a Sherlock Homes film to be. The film is a solid 3.5/4 Stars out of 5.    Now for the blu ray, the disc comes with a digital copy which is a plus, for at the time where almost every new film to blu ray/dvd was using the bonus digital copy I have noticed that not all newer releases are coming with the digital copy. Not sure if many people use the added bonus, but I personally use most digital copies that come with blu rays. So I was glad to see Warner Bros. continuing this with new releases. I haven't viewed the special features but from what I have seen, it is the usuals which again is good.    Overall this was a very enjoyable film that I would watch again some other time in the future. From the ending, there was a lot of hinting at a sequel which should be another great film with the \\"new\\" Holmes & Watson duo. I recommend this blu-ray/dvd for it was a good package.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|I love all things Madonna, and this CD/DVD combo is no exception. The CD only contains 13 songs, which is a bit disappointing. They're all great tunes (\\"Vogue 2008\\" is my fave), but I just wish there were more of them, as I'm not really into music DVDs. However, that being said, the DVD is awesome. It contains the ENTIRE tour performance from Buenos Aries and exclusive behind-the-scenes footage, which Madonna fans will drool over. I saw the Sticky & Sweet tour in Chicago, and this music set is a great way to relive the magic. I love you, Madonna! Please tour again soon!
B002ZMZBD2|4.0|Hans Zimmer has crafted a great score for the film, Sherlock Holmes. The continuous theme that plays throughout the entire film really helps set the mood of the story and setting. Just like the great job Zimmer has done for The Dark Knight, the score for Sherlock Holmes is just as good. I was glad to see that it got an Oscar nomination for it deserves it. Great job overall check this one out.

0307454541|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of those highly touted books that, for the first several chapters, makes you wonder what all the hoopla is about. But once the set up is done, all those early doubts dissipate. Stieg Larsson's characters are gritty and real. This story, first in a trilogy, introduces brilliant but disgraced journalist Mikael Blonkvist and emotionally disturbed ward of the state Lisbeth Salander, a pairing so unlikely that it is at first unbelievable. But have faith. This unusual twosome pools their not inconsiderable mental resources and manages to crack a cold case with unforeseeable repercussions.<br /><br />This is a dark story concerned with victimization and concealment, the debasement of the powerless by the powerful, and the indifference of government. Nazi-ism rears its ugly head, a full half century after its defeat. This book also deals with the more personal issues surrounding personal relationships, especially those of trust and integrity.  Some sections are truly the stuff of nightmare. But Girl/Tattoo is also concerned with the power of motivation and determination. Serial murder, rape, high tech trickery, corporate corruption, family secrets, all combine to make this thriller un-put-down-able.<br /><br />It's truly lamentable that author Larsson did not live to see the incredible reception his novel has received. Recognition should also be granted to Reg Keeland for his stellar translation from Swedish to English.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Watching the Johnny Cash Show video brought back so many memories of him and his performances in the late '60's and early '70's. I grew up watching Johnny on Hootenanny, Jimmy Dean's show and later his own TV show.  There is no one who compares with Cash.  I enjoyed the variety of guests he had on his program and it showed a wide range of talent during that time period. I'm so glad to add this DVD to my collection of Cash music and videos.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|The first half of the movie is one spectacular disaster after another. Lots of falling buildings, explosions, hairbreadth escapes; a really good popcorn movie. Then they had to go and ruin it in the second half with moronic characters, machinery designed to fail and a fake politically-correct morality that covers the second half of the movie like decayed mayonnaise. Please.
B0035G9ABG|4.0|In a few words: If you want [[ASIN:B00082IJ08 Demon Days]] or [[ASIN:B00005LMBK Gorillaz]] pass this up. If you want to hear the next phase of Gorillaz' musical adventure, as well as a solid, Earth conscience, electropop album, go out right now and get this. For what it's worth, I'd say get it either way. But the slow, melancholy hip-hop swagger of Demon Days is traded in here for a upbeat (if ironic) electronic sound. Damon Albarn's vocals are sounding more and more... well, like Damon Albarn's and less like 2-D's lately. But this was already happening In Demon Days when the falsetto was ditched nearly completely. The falsetto makes a return here, but with a different vibe. More like Albarn on \\"The Universal.\\"     The guests are prominent on this album, but I feel they're not a main feature. While I feel that the guest heavy tracks in Demon Days are some of the best (\\"November Has Come,\\" \\"Feel Good Inc.,\\" \\"DARE,\\" \\"All Alone\\",) \\"Rhinestone Eyes,\\" \\"Broken,\\" and \\"On Melancholy Hill\\" may be some of the best Gorillaz tunes in quite some time that do not feature guests. However, while many of the guests on this album manage to sound a little out of place (like Snoop Dogg on \\"Welcome to the Plastic Beach,\\" and Marky Smith on \\"Glitter Freeze\\") many of them help to paint an amazing musical palette of nearly epic proportions. Little Dragon does a fantastic job of covering female vocals on this album, presumably playing the role of Noodle for this phase with songs like \\"To Binge\\" and \\"Empire Ants,\\" the former containing some of the most emotional lyrics yet in a Gorillaz tune. Likewise, Mos Def and Bobby Womack electrify \\"Stylo,\\" and Lou Reed (a pairing I thought I'd never see) sprinkles \\"Some Kind of Nature\\" with his usual sarcasm and dry wit. Of course, Gorillaz pair up with my favorite hip hop group De La Soul once again on \\"Superfast Jellyfish,\\" a quirky tune if a bit disappointing in concept (it's a commercial for Superfast Jellyfish, a conceptual food of the future whenthe polar ice caps melt and the Earth is mostly water.) The album closes with a mysterious, airy tune by Bobby Womack, \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\" and the soul-inspired green tune \\"Pirate Jet\\" (contains my favorite line in the album \\"It's all good news now, because we left the taps running for a hundred years\\") which brings the album to a faded close, but leaves a bit to be desired. All-in-all the track listing in massive in its scale but leaves you wanting for more. It almost doesn't feel as much like a Gorillaz album, but rather like a mixtape of some kind. And the extra tracks included with the iTunes Deluxe edition are no more than instrumentals, including an extended version of the Orchestral Intro. So, while the music is outstanding, the album as a whole suffers from a lack of... well, Gorillaz. There are around five tracks on this album that don't feature Albarn's vocals at all, concentrating on the guests instead, unless you count Damon's looped line \\"Just like that\\" in \\"Welcome to the Plastic Beach.\\"     Taking a step back outside the music for a moment, the storyline of Gorillaz continues to be interesting, saving much of this phase's intrigue for after the album's release instead of before, like in Demon Days or Gorillaz. There are many mysteries to be solved, and even the new Gorillaz website is going to be opened piece by piece to allow for exploration of the storyline and to add some anticipation to figuring out the puzzle contained within Plastic Beach's history. Many fans complain of a lack of Russel or Noodle (both having been ditched by Murdoc... sort of,) but I remain faithful that Cass and Jamie have many creative twists and turns in store for us yet. It should be noted that the idea of a movie has not been nixed, and the idea that this is Gorillaz' last album has been walked back quite a bit. To add to that, the artwork this phase has been taken a step up. It's some of the best, most vibrant Gorillaz artwork I've ever seen from Mr. Hewlett. He opted to breathe new life into the design of the characters this time around by redesigning them almost completely (especially with Murdoc) and straying from old conventions on their stylings. The packaging is absolutely beautiful, which is why I remain hopeful for a vinyl release.    All-in-all, another fantastic album from Gorillaz. It's always hard for me to place which one is my favorite because it seems like each album is a new experience on its own, rather than a continuation of the same thing. I would suggest going into this album with an open mind, and an open heart.    Standout Tracks: \\"Rhinestone Eyes,\\" \\"Stylo,\\" \\"Superfast Jellyfish,\\" \\"Some Kind of Nature,\\" and \\"To Binge\\"
B0039UTDA6|2.0|I am such a huge fan of Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Blue Pacific and so many of the Discovery Channel's mini-series.  However, Oprah's narration of Life is just awful.  It is so dumbed down---I felt like my granny was talking to me--when I was 4.  Its just too put on, too preschool teacher-esque.  I loved the video and pictures--they are absolutely incredible, as would be expected, but I cannot figure out why the Discovery Channel would seek out a pop celeb to narrate this great show.  Why change it from the original?  I am so tired of Hollywood permeating every facet of media.  Just b/c you're good at one thing does not make you stellar at it all.  I'm buying the BBC version.
6304711905|5.0|Kevin Costner's WYATT EARP never stood a chance, did it? Its theatrical release came six months on the heels of TOMBSTONE, which is hands down better and my favorite film featuring lawman Wyatt Earp. TOMBSTONE is not as contemplative as MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or HOUR OF THE GUN or GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, but its sheer bravado and energy kept my eyeballs glued to the screen. TOMBSTONE breathes thunder and swagger into an old western legend.<br /><br />Tombstone, Arizona in 1879, and the territory is lorded over by over 100 exiled Texas outlaws calling themselves the Cowboys, identified by their red sashes and led by Curly Bill Brocius and the fast-draw killer Johnny Ringo and numbering the Clantons in its roster. And then Wyatt Earp came to Tombstone, retired from his days as a Kansas peace officer and intent only on a fresh start as an entrepreneur with his brothers. Except that Wyatt Earp was never meant to go down in the history books as a businessman.<br /><br />Who knows how accurate this adaptation is? I don't know. Word is the first half of TOMBSTONE is more or less true to the real life account, is fairly faithful to what led up to the blood feud between the Earps and the Clanton gang, but that the second half deals in sprawling malarkey. All I know is that I'm always hugely entertained when I see this movie. History buffs of the Old West may beg to differ. I just like to see bullets fly with impunity.<br /><br />I am bowled over by the bristling machismo and attitude. If nothing else, TOMBSTONE pound for pound has to boast more aggressive facial hair than any other film in recent memory. Familiar faces dot this landscape, quite a bit of these actors being of the manly persuasion: Sam Elliot, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Charlton Heston, Michael Rooker, Billy Bob Thornton, and even Robert Mitchum drops by to do some narrative voice-over. But Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer carry this baby. Russell is bedrock solid as the centerpiece, playing Wyatt Earp with unrelenting intensity and boring holes with his icy stare. His brooding interpretation easily dismisses Kevin Costner's own take as inferior stuff. Russell's defining moment comes early when he braces the bullying faro dealer at the Oriental bar casino. \\"Skin that smoke wagon and see what happens,\\" he ominously dares the bully, and we immediately know this cat is not to be effed with. The faro dealer is properly cowed, and keep in mind that this is Billy Bob Thornton playing the faro dealer.<br /><br />It's Kilmer, though, in his best role ever, who walks away with the universal plaudits. Val Kilmer is magnificent and magnificently sly in a performance that manages to simultaneously convey terminal sickliness and a detached, reckless flair. Doc Holliday, unrepentant sinner and cough-ridden, cuts a tragic figure, and yet he delivers the most memorable lines, cool customer that he is. I really don't know how many times I've quoted \\"I'm your huckleberry\\" or \\"You're no daisy\\" to friends, but I'm now pretty much hated for it. A marvelous bit of cinema surfaces when Doc Holliday and Johnny Ringo (a mad dog Michael Biehn) bait each other in Latin and then there's that inspired contest of braggadocio immediately following. No man could've ever struck down THIS Doc Holliday. Only tuberculosis could fit him for a casket.<br /><br />Did we need to see Wyatt Earp's floundering marriage and his subsequent romance with the stage actress? Not really, not in a testosterone-driven revenge movie like this. TOMBSTONE is all about slick black coats and lawlessness being tamed, about Russell's fierceness and his handlebar 'stache, and Val Kilmer looking like death warmed over and yet still expertly dealing in lead. Law comes to Tombstone and it's keeping an eye out for red sashes, mustache combs, and maybe some cough drops.unrelenting intensity and boring holes with his icy stare.

030726999X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander, the girl of the title, is being hunted as a suspect in a triple murder when a police officer is killed.  She arrives in the emergency room with a piece of lead in her brain.  The ER is efficient chaos.  The cop killer is identified.  It is Niedermann, one of the people Salander has encountered.  Blomkvist persuades his sister, a women's rights attorney, to represent Salander.<br /><br />The Section for Special Analysis of the Security Police used to be an eleven person office situated at a secret location.  It was headed by Evert Gullberg.  In 1976 Zalachenko, Salander's father, was a defector from the Soviet Union.  When the unit was disbanded after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Zalachenko was sent to Spain.  Gullberg retired.  Blomkvist, the journalist, has a theory that the security services conspired against the well-being of Salander.  He plans to write an expose.<br /><br />The distinctive practices of journalism and medicine are covered in detailed ways.  Of great interest are the descriptions of police and justice agencies in Sweden.  I haven't read both of the previous books in this trilogy, just the first.  I like this better than THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  It is more exciting and has amplitude.<br /><br />Salander's group of hackers is fascinating.  Also fascinating is Salander, someone with Asperger-like characteristics and abilities.  She is not the only amazonian presence considered by the author.  There are others.  Seldom have so many strong female characters driven a plot.<br /><br />The plot is clever, compelling.  This is excellent.  There are notes at the end.
0780624890|4.0|Before the bubblegum age of PG-13 comic book films kicked in with the debut of SPIDER-MAN and others, New Line made the bold move in releasing the BLADE vampire series with a Hard-R rating geared directly towards the Horror movie crowd. It not only proved to be a great success, but Stephen Norrington's bloody and ultra-violent film also managed to jettison the B-list hero into super stardom. Much of the credit is also due to Wesley Snipes winning performance as the pompous slayer, and while the character is often taken far over the top, his dead serious demeanor and high-powered action kept him grounded without ever becoming goofy. Norrington brings a fresh, clean filming style to Goyer's script, balancing the many fight scenes with enough character and plot structure to keep the audience engaged from start to finish. Where the film does take a hit is in some of the ridiculous comic book logic, where Blade is able to walk through the streets in full regalia, beating up cops and killing vampires while remaining completely unnoticed by the crowds of onlookers. With enough action, violence, and gore to quench the thirst of any average Horror fan, BLADE proves to be a welcome addition to the genre, though it can often be argued that it is more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B001GCUO5M|5.0|It is in many ways a great film. It questions the \\"heritage\\" of the Second World War and the horror the American soldiers discovered in the camps, in this case here Dachau. It is also more than clear on the passage of some of the researchers of Nazi Germany to the US to continue their research in peace, including if necessary with human experiments when dealing with medical research. It is unluckily well-known that prisons and orphanages were places of hellish torturing and violence in the name of research or reform. That's the first level of the film. The second level is: what can society do with the few human beings who are so bad that they can't be reformed? Various solutions are available: lobotomizing them to turn them into docile pets, pharmaceuticalizing their cases so that they become chemical zombies, or manipulating their minds to make them convinced of what they have done and of the necessary punishment called treatment they are receiving. The film goes even as far as imagining the production of human killing tools that could be used in wars. Surgery, drugs or mental manipulation, that's the choices envisaged here. The three of them are all just fully wrong. But the film is a lot more disquieting than that if we deal with the simple fact that the decision of a psychiatrist to classify you as anything psychic or psychological is absolutely irreversible and everything you may say or do to prove you are not will be turned into the evidence that you are and will be used against you. In other words the lady always protests too much. That's the Kafka aspect of the tale. But the film is even better than all that because Scorsese in his personal style builds a story in which we do not know at all at the end if the two cops were really what they pretended to be at the beginning and thus were kidnapped by the doctors to make sure nothing will seep out of their concentration camp, or if it is the doctors who are right at the end and that the two cops are what these doctors pretend, one is a killer and the other his doctor and that the whole tale was a medical procedure to reach treatment. At the end there is only one choice left: to live as a monster or to die in dignity. But what is dignity in such an environment? We are happily doubting everything at the end, which may create a feeling of frustration in the audience.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDdoctors pretend, one is a killer and the other his doctor and that the whole tale was a medical procedure to reach treatment.

0385523386|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I picked up this book last night, but I most certainly did not expect that I would be unable to put it down. I read the book cover to cover and found that I was so attached to the strong, compassionate and in many instances unlucky women the author met in prison that I couldn't help but wonder how they are all doing today. This story is yet another real example of how resilient people can be and the power of love.  For many American's, it is easy to forget about the large number of people in prisons across the country, especially the women. This book is an excellent reminder.   I haven't had Ms. Kerman's book for 24 hours yet, and I have already recommended it to friends and family. Amazing!
B001HN694K|5.0|This film is the most surprising adaptation of this typically Victorian novel for children written by Lewis Carroll and published in 1865, one hundred and fifty years ago. Centered on a woman, Alice, it is a memento about the role of women in society and their necessary liberation. The queen was Victoria and as such was setting an example, and in 1865 she was still young. Lewis Carroll with his two queens fighting for supremacy and the crown is providing a caricature of what the world would be if only women were at the top and that is a direct allusion to the debate of the time when Queen Victoria became a widow and refused to remarry. Behind this discourse about the liberation of women, or rather the promotion of women into responsible positions in the world, there is the discourse that they need men to stabilize and balance their government, their authority. It is obvious that Alice ending up as the captain (really?) of a colonial ship is the modern addition to the tale.<br /><br />But this story is of course the matrix of a tremendous amount of children’s literature in England, though rarely so much oriented on women. We can think of The Chronicles of Narnia by another Lewis, C.S. this one, where girls and boys are more equally balanced. And in this case there is also at the beginning a tyrannical queen. We could on the other hand think of Tolkien and his Hobbit or his Lord of the Ring and there men and boys, all males of course, are vastly dominant and we go back to the plain old pattern. This being said what is the creative dimension of this particularly adaptation?<br /><br />First of all the technique is using all kinds of tricks to manipulate the pictures and make people disappear or appear, the cat particularly. Along the same line it uses monstrous beings like the Jabberwocky, or distorted beings like the two fat boys. On the other hand some are supremely realistic like the dogs. He is also able to use a mixture of digitally mastered beings like the card soldiers within a “natural” setting and with human actors. But those techniques are now very standardized in the cinema with Dreamworks Studios for example or the various Star Wars films.<br /><br />The second originality of this film is that it is entirely in full colors, and the dark scenes are rare, in the forest a little bit and a couple of night scenes. But otherwise it is luxuriant in colors, both the real world and Wonderland, called Underland or not. I must admit too that the fall in the dark hole is extravagant and brilliantly composed.<br /><br />The third element is of course the use of the strange mysterious language the hatter and some others practice. That language is typical of Lewis Carroll who has been using that type of meaningless gibberish language in many poems too, like The Hunting of the Snark. Lewis Carroll was a mathematical mind in a way and he considered that what Saussure was going to call the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign was absolute and thus anyone could invent new signs, meaning words, as long as the syntax, the formal rules associating these words, and the intonation were respected. So in his world “Fridig imeas man flowbaster fluously akum spoul midsten spoof,” as long as the intonation centers properly on the modal “man” and the verb “flowbaster.” We understand the intonation of what the hatter says not the words but that does not matter because it is the Hatter and he is there to make us believe we are in another universe.<br /><br />The fourth element is the overflowing of all kinds of feelings and emotions in this film. The characters are suffering, crying, getting angry, fearful and frightened, they start running away and hiding and yet are captured and beheaded while one queen is enjoying such torturing and capital punishment and at the same time the other queen seems to be weak and maybe even impotent. And what is that queen who has taken vows that prevent her from defending her own country and people?That’s the aristocratic superiority wrapped up in vows that sound kind of religious. Is she a nun or something? She does not sound very pleasant.<br /><br />The fifth element I like and dislike at the same time is the forced cohabitation of the red queen and her knight in exile tied up one to the other. That’s cruel and useless. Why didn’t Tim Burton put them to work at some useful task, not useful for them but useful for the people, like cleaning up their mess and rebuilding the ruins? In other words Tim Burton did not modernize the tale entirely, certainly not enough.<br /><br />The sixth point is the Hatter. He was of course expected to be great and Johnny Depp makes it outstanding, outscoring, outreaching in all directions and he is really superb, except his last dance, a fudderwupping that looks like no whipping no feathers not at all and which could sound OK on paper but does not look that realistic nor attractive, like some kind of extravaganza by some contorsionist, though I would prefer it here in German, ein Schlangenmensch or eine Schlangenfrau or even why not ein Schlangenweib. But that sounds and looks barbaric. I am sure Tim Burton could have thought of something more realistic that children could have imitated like some voodoo trance extreme dancing. That’s Tim Burton’s problem: at times he overuses his technology and seems to think a technical prank has to be artistically good. But it is not always the case.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUup in vows that sound kind of religious. Is she a nun or something? She does not sound very pleasant.

B003EM54IE|4.0|I suppose it will be debated into eternity whether The Doors were truly an awesome blend of rock and jazz. Just as the \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" album, Chicago's first and also their full name, The Doors creatively interspersed jazz leanings into their rock sensibilities. Anytime you challenge the conventional, there is usually a rather abrupt counter challenge from the other side. The lyrics to \\"Light My Fire\\", \\"wallow in the mire\\" and \\"our love becomes a funeral pyre\\" captivated my 14 years old ears. I somehow knew this band could not survive on the light and bright sounds of AM radio. There was Morrison's dark and distinctive baritone echoing his dark and forbidding poetry. The 60s defied the conventional neatness of the preceding disingenuous 50s. Thanks, in part, to the sophistication of advertising coming of age during the television era, the picture was drilled into our heads via the perfect white worlds of \\"Leave it to Beaver\\", \\"I Love Lucy\\" and \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\". The view was devoid of diversity that characters could live in New York City and never once see a black or hispanic person, unless they were maids or menial task workers. So as the hippie culture pushed hard against these false images, a band like The Doors comes to fruition right before the fabled \\"Summer of Love-1968\\".     With lyrics that would challenge the average AM radio listener, the band still knew how to craft neat pop songs enough to garner several #1 singles and Top 10 smashes.    But it was the deep album tracks like \\"The End\\" and \\"Break on (Through to the Other Side) that would command a different ear.    So for those new to the greatness of Jim Morrison, \\"When You're Strange\\" is a respectable slice of this very unique band.     The movie, documentary, like \\"Single Man\\" shows a side of Los Angeles that was once a creative hotbed and not an aviary for dead philistines circling the city of Lost Angels. For those who really could only muster 1 star, then clearly you came to thisreview with an intended agenda......because, even if you find Johnny Depp's spoken words unnecessary, how could you honestly deny \\"Love Her Madly\\" or \\"Love Me Two Times\\" or \\"Hello, I Love You\\" as great pop singles?

B00008972S|2.0|This musical works with the Shakespeare play, Romeo and Juliet, but the ending is absurd. Juliet lives. Both have to die in their love for each other, as the mortal world cannot contain their relationship. Also, as Maria walks away, it looks like all is resolved; it cannot be the case.Their deaths dispel the warring gangs; the temptation to violence is over as these two lovers become the sacrificial figures that stop the hatred and violence for good. It has to be both.    Their mutual deaths erase for a time, the terrible racist conflicts that typify the two gangs. The degrading feud has a wide effect, and that is why it is called, this musiocal, WEst Side Story, and not Maria and Tony or whatever.    The tragedy is missing, and the loose ends are too awkward to ignore. A real failure in plot, and, in this musical version, in the castin as well.    Elvis Presley was supposed to be Tony at one point, and Anna Maria Alberghetti Maria. Talent went out the window, with the present cast, and so did verisimilitude.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|For lack of better comparison, it seems that the Gorillaz have crafted their \\"OK Computer\\". I'm not actually COMPARING Gorillaz to Radiohead, but lets look at the similarities, here: Way back in 2001 the Gorillaz put out their self titled debut. It boasted a very \\"anything-goes\\" mentality which yielded mixed results. Some tracks were fantastic, (\\"Tomorrow Comes Today\\", \\"New Genious\\", \\"Sound Check\\" and the amazing instrumental, \\"Double Bass\\") yet others flopped. This seems to mirror Radiohead's first release, \\"Pablo Honey\\". Then, in 2005, Gorillaz released \\"Demon Days\\". It was far more focused and had a very conceptual feel. The almost constant serious tone it held throughout sort of weighed it down, though. This, again, mirrors Radiohead's second release, \\"The Bends\\".    Now we get to \\"Plastic Beach\\". Much like Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", they let everything out of their creative box. Whereas OK Computer focused on how the advancement of technology was dehumanizing society, Plastic Beach focuses on how everything in the world has began to revolve around all of this \\"plastic-imagery\\" and, because of this, we have all become detached from real-world issues. The Gorillaz have truly crafted something that is not only relative to the times in subject matter, but also in sound.    Lets get to the main point, though: This is the Gorillaz best album to date. Albarn has created an album of excellently crafted music that can be fun, yet still be taken seriously. After a brief intro, the album kicks of with \\"Welcome To The World Of The Plastic Beach\\". Oddly, Albarn recruited Snoop Dogg (of all artists) to do all of the vocals for the song. At first this may sound odd, but it's got a really solid groove and sets the tone of the album well. After that, we fly headlong into a full array of hand drums, flutes and a string section that introduces \\"White Flag\\". But after the intro it turns into a full on experimental hip-hop song with vocals exclusively from the British artists Bashyand Kano. What I like about these two tracks is that they display that not all hip-hop has to be self-indulgent and unintelligent. Basically they are the best examples of American and British hip-hop done right.    After all of that we get treated to \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\", the first track to feature Albarn on vocals. It's got a really classic Gorillaz feel to it. We also see here how much better Albarn has gotten at actually producing MUSIC. All of the little blips and bleeps blend perfectly with the synth and create a really melancholy soundscape that the Gorillaz have always been known for. But here, it's done better than on all of their previous albums. \\"Stylo\\" is the albums first single, and for good reason. If you want catchy, look no further. But here's where it gets interesting...it's also one of the most atmospheric songs they have put out. Almost conjuring up Violator-era Depeche Mode in the verses. It also boasts Albarn's best vocals to date. Did I also mention it includes guest vocals from BOBBY WOMACK?    \\"Superfast Jellyfish\\" is the funnest and most light-hearted song on the album, musically. That being said, it also really brings up some great points about how our over-consumption is blinding us. The contrast works really well. \\"Empire Ants\\" is the song that really sold me on the album. It's the first of two songs that Albarn co-wrote with Yukimi Nagano. It's starts with very slow-burning and contemplative atmospherics and then builds to a shimmering climax. Here is where we see that Albarn has gotten leaps and bounds better as a producer. The studio-trickery used in the song is nothing short of phenomenal. Sadly, after such a great song the only real stinker pops it's head up. \\"Glitter Freeze\\" isn't technically a bad song, but it just lacks that special something that the majority of the rest of the tracks seem to have. It works well as an interlude, though.    Next, comes one of the best collaborations Albarn has ever done. Recruiting Lou Reed was an amazing idea. His mono-tone crooning flows superbly with Albarn's more processed and falsetto-laden delivery and makes \\"Some Kind Of Nature\\" one of the true standouts on the album. But the real reason to check out the album comes next. \\"Melancholy Hill\\" is not only the best song on the album, but also the greatest song Albarn and company have ever created. It's a relaxing little piece about daydreaming and reminiscing. It somehow manages to be uplifting, contemplative, soothing and heartbreaking all at the same time. This song alone is reason enough to purchase this album.    \\"Broken\\" is a traditional Gorillaz track that fits well with the flow of the album. It's got some really well-done atmospherics and a solid vocal delivery. It works best in the context of the album, though. \\"Sweepstakes\\" took me a long time to warm up to. At first I hated it, but with time, it kept growing on me. It features De La Soul exclusively on vocals and his abilities as an MC shine, here. It's hard to really explain the song, because it all seems sort of contradictory when talked about. It's both the most repetitive, yet progressive and ever-changing song on the album. Just listen and you'll understand.    The title track opens with a guitar intro that I could imagine being played during a pivotal scene in a Tarantino flick. It then evolves into a spiraling keyboard line complete with some classic Albarn vocals. It also sports the catchiest chorus on the album and a cool little breakdown before the end. A solid track. \\"To Binge\\" is the second song co-wrote by Yukimi Nagano. It features a pass-the-baton vocal delivery from her and Albarn and it works surprisingly well. It almost feels like the Gorillaz take on the Cohen classic, \\"Hallelujah\\" in some ways. Musically it actually reminds me of Vampire Weekend on their more mellow-days.    The album closes with \\"Cloud Of Unknowing\\" and \\"Pirate Jet\\". Womack reprises his role on Cloud Of Unknowing, and the outcome is fantastic. All the song is is swelling atmospherics and Womack's heartfelt vocals. Never before has his voice felt better suited for anything. It's stirring, to say the least. \\"Pirate Jet\\" works mostly as a short and playful little outro. But it sums up the point of the album perfectly.    \\"Its all good news now  Because we left the taps  Running for a hundred years  So drink into the drink    A plastic cup of drink  Drink with the purple  The people, the plastic eating people    Still connected  to the moment it began.\\"      In short, if this is truly the Gorillaz \\"OK Computer\\", then their \\"Kid A\\" will be something that will go down in the history books as a new turning-point for music.
0545123267|5.0|I just got through reading Shiver and I thought it was a fantastic book. The last books I read was the Twilight Saga and I thought nothing would ever come close. This series will be the next Twilight Saga I am sure of it. It was a very moving story and the way it was written, I thought was quite clever. If you are unsure about reading it I say it's defiantely worth it. I feel it will be another one of the greatest love stories of our time. I really can not wait until the next book of the series \\"Linger\\" is released so I can continue my journey with the characters.    [[ASIN:0545123267 Shiver]]
B000AOEMXM|4.0|For the record.  I've watched every single Star Trek there has been.  The Original Series (TOS), The Next Generation (TNG), Deep Space Nine (DS9), Voyager (VOY), and now, Enterprise (ENT).  I've watched, and own, all of the various Star Trek movies that have been released to date.  I like to consider myself a resident expert on all of the characters and the branching story behind the series thus far, with the exception of Enterprise.  That's not for lack of trying - I did watch the episodes, many times.  The problem is the show itself.  Let me explain.    I remember when Enterprise was first announced.  It was shortly after Gene Roddenberry left us, at a time we still had shows such as Earth: Final Conflict, Babylon 5, Farscape, Stargate, even the absolutely horrific Cleopatra 2525.  In those days sci-fi shows were a dime a dozen, and it seemed as though everyone was trying to copy everyone else.  Enterprise was touted with a dramatic commercial that said, \\"Before Janeway...Before Picard...Before Kirk...\\" and showed snippets of the crew experiencing such things as Klingons for the first time.  Archer, the captain of the Enterprise, had an edge to him as he was shown in verbal altercations with his Vulcan first officer.  It seemed like they had some decent ideas.  The problem was the presentation of the show; it was doomed from the start.    First, and most notably, the Enterprise in ENT was noticeably more advanced than the one in TOS.  A lot of people commented on this from the very start: If this was supposed to be one of the first warp-capable ships to go out beyond Earth, why was the ship so much cleaner and advanced than Kirk's ship?  It was explained that going with older technology wouldn't have come across well on the screen, but I wholeheartedly disagree.  The reason they did what they did was to bring in new viewers who'd never watched a Star Trek in their life.  From the moment Roddenberry died, those who are in control of the franchise have done their worst to get new fans, instead of keeping what made the series popular in the first place.  People were watching Kirk battling aliens as far back as the 60's yet stopped watching sometime after DS9 because of this dynamic.    Secondly, Season 1.  It was riddled with incidents that were absolutely unnecessary; times when the crew were experiencing things for the first time, i.e. Klingons, phasers, photon torpedoes, the transporter...it was like at first they tried their best to appeal to Star Trek fans, but it felt overdone and overemphasized.  The attempt was novel, the approach was wrong.      Third, and maybe this is just me, but Johnathan Archer got on my nerves.  Scott Bakula is a good actor when he wants to be.  The problem is that he was too good an actor in Quantum Leap: it was hard not to imagine the blue flashing light and him leaping out of there, into someone else's life.  This feeling never once went away the entire time I watched, and usually that's an indicator that their acting in the present show is not nearly as good as their acting in the previous show.  I don't blame Bakula.  He did the best he could with what he was handed.  However, I don't think using him for this show was a good idea at all.  A distant descendant of Christopher Pike would have been better suited; someone serious and up to the task, because that's what all of the other captains essentially were.  Bakula's notoriety from Quantum Leap hurt his credibility in ENT; even more so when they had Dean Stockwell (Al, from Quantum Leap) guest starred in an episode in Season 2.  Archer's seriousness and fits of anger felt forced and contrived, rather than genuinely heartfelt.  It was just all around bad, in my humble opinion.  What's worse, the writers made him seem invincible.  Numerous times he is either killed, nearly killed or should have been killed, yet manages to not only survive, but pull off impossible feats: pilot ships from foreign worlds without issue, survive many hours of torture and pain, go days without eating, even make a time travel device MacGuyver-style from a desolate wasteland.  The show centers around him, and it hurt the show severely.      Fourth, and I won't spoil it, but suffice to say that Johnathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis should be ashamed of themselves for what they did.  I think they are now, but it's too little too late.        I could go on and on, but those are the major ones.  Now I'll give you a brief rundown of the various seasons.    SEASON 1: The pilot.  This is where most of the Human/Vulcan antagonism is felt, as well as the crew's curiosity and desire to visit new worlds and make first contact with other species.  Some of these are from the Star Trek canon: Vulcans, Andorians, etc.  All of the crew are briefly introduced, and some background is given about each, with the exception of two.  Hoshi Sato is a language specialist that is teaching in Brazil.  She is acquainted with Archer, and her presence is requested on the ship.  T'Pol is assigned to Enterprise by the Vulcan High Command to evaluate the progress of their mission.   Charles \\"Trip\\" Tucker is the chief engineer and a long time friend of Archer.  Malcolm Reed is the tactical officer, but he's not introduced (there's a good reason for this though, revealed in Season 4.  See more there), and nobody knows much about him, not even his parents.  Travis Mayweather is the primary helmsman, and a former cargo runner from a family business.  Phlox, one of only two aliens on Enterprise, is a noted Denobulan physician.      The good thing about Season 1 is the drama.  The exchanges between T'Pol and Archer were good, and it felt as though the two had a opposing magnetism that would prove to be entertaining.  Sadly this antagonism would dwindle by Season 2, never to be seen again, and would prove detrimental to the overall story.  Also, T'Pol never came across truly \\"Vulcan\\" in the vein of Spock (who ironically was half human unlike T'Pol).  Every Vulcan had a presence about him, an air of superiority and leadership.  T'Pol showed neither trait anytime during Season 1, which in my opinion hurt her character.      SEASON 2: There was a much stronger focus on shock value.  Here, there are more interactions with alien worlds, as well as the attack on Earth that led to the Delphic Expanse.  Archer finds out that one of his crewmen is actually a time traveller, the battles with the Suliban begin to take shape, and it is here that Archer turns into Mr. Unstoppable.  There is a little sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol, but nothing too compelling; the crew are adjusting to life on the ship.  Tucker and Reed are improving the ship's systems.  T'Pol is subjected to her first mind meld and contracts a disease that affects her ability to suppress emotions.  Ferengi are introduced here.      Season 2 was the slowest of the four; it didn't really do much to advance the story until the final episodes, when the Xindi storyline began, and another episode that dealt with the destruction of the colony and more time travel events.      SEASON 3: Might as well refer to this as the \\"Xindi Season\\", since that's really all it dealt with.  The Xindi launched an attack on Earth, killing over 7 million, including Trip's sister.  Trip, in his grief, is having trouble sleeping.  Meanwhile, there is friction between the Vulcan High Command and Archer over going after the Xindi, which leads to Archer going anyway, and T'Pol dropping her commission to join them.  They encounter a Vulcan ship that was lost years prior, filled with Vulcans that had been subverted by an ore.  T'Pol is affected during this, and later develops an addiction that, in conjunction with the mind meld disease, causes negative effects.  She and Tucker undergo a relaxation massage ritual to help Tucker sleep which eventually leads into more intimacy between them.    Enterprise encounters many different types of Xindi and other races in the Expanse, and with the aid of some of the Xindi, manages to stop the attack on Earth, but again, Mr. Unstoppable strikes again as he escapes certain death effortlessly.    Season 3 felt like Star Trek: Nemesis in a way and that's not a compliment.  The T'Pol/Tucker angle was well done, and the Xindi storyline added some much-needed beef to a show that had so far been underwhelming.  If it weren't for the fact that Archer managed to yet again overcome impossible odds, and the fact that Enterprise, a ship based on technology that should have been light years behind the Xindi, managed to survive everything the Xindi and other races threw at it, it might have been a decent season, but there were too many things that just didn't make sense.      SEASON 4: After the peace with the remaining Xindi, the Enterprise returns home, only to find that the humans are no longer comfortable with non-humans.  This kicks off a rebel faction called Terra Prime that is out to cleanse Earth of non-humans.  Phlox encounters racism, Vulcans are attacked and threatened, a Mars colony is taken over and used to threaten the planet, and other events that are reminiscent of Babylon 5's later events with Edgar Industries and their attempt to eradicate telepaths.  Various TOS, TNG and DS9 references are explained here, such as the Gorn, Soong's androids (Data, Lore, B-4), Khan and the other superhumans, and the Tholian Web.  This is also supposed to introduce the alternate universe, first seen in TOS and later in DS9.  It ends with the signing of the Federation Charter by Archer, and the death of a central crew member.  It also marked the apparent first introduction of Section 31, which Reed had been a member of (thus explaining why nobody knew anything about him when he came aboard.  He was sent to be their eyes and ears, though there was no evidence of this in any of the seasons).  We are introduced to T'Pau, the one who would go on to become a high ranking Vulcan official, overseeing the pon farr battle ritual between Spock and Kirk.    You know, Season 4 had its moments.  It quite possibly was the most exciting of all of the seasons in terms of its presentation, but the problem is that it did way too much, wrong.  The way it handled the alternate universe was so haphazard that it negated any potential value of explaining it.  The death of the crewmember was absolutely pointless and never would have happened otherwise; there was no logic to doing it, and said person was a lot more resourceful and collected than they portrayed them to be.  The Terra Prime Incident had potential that was unrealized by the writers; instead of a rogue mining colony and spies all over the place (it was also a mistake to not have subtle activities by Reed to show that he was doing covert operations for Section 31, starting with Season 1 when he first came aboard.  Show him saying vague statements on encrypted channels to someone, keep the watchers guessing as to what he's doing.  This was a missed opportunity).  The episode with the Orion slave girls made absolutely no sense; there was no evidence in any of the other Star Trek series that the slave girls had pheromone-based mind control powers over men.  The Defiant destroying the Tholian Web also made no sense, as TOS made it quite clear that the web was incapacitating to a ship from that era, and it took essentially a subspace anomaly to get Enterprise free.  The alternate universe episodes were the most entertaining of all of the episodes in the series, but they were harmed by one small factoid: They should have been an Enterprise movie.  Period.  Even the entrance theme had been changed to show the darkness of this new showing, and such a thing might have garnered interest.  It wouldn't have hurt to add more to it as well...it ended abruptly with Empress Sato without explaining her significance to anything.    The worst thing about Season 4 was the series finale, for sure.  I won't spoil that, but again, Frakes and Sirtis should be ashamed of themselves.  Theybasically gave a big middle finger to all of the actors in this series, especially with the way it ended.        So...do I recommend buying this?  Only if you just want to know all there is about Star Trek and want to add this to the collection.  I agree the price is steep; don't buy it new.  Look for Warehouse Deals, they usually have a good price on this set.  As a Star Trek series, it's last in the bunch for sure.

0743455967|5.0|I was totally smitten by the writing of Stephen King in this book, and wanted to read more of his work.  I'd never read him before, and was compelled to find a title I could tolerate. I'm not into blood and guts or eeriness or weirdness - but I truly admire King's use of language and his ability to create characters and the consistency of plotting he discusses in On Writing. It's so simple, but \\"What would happen if...\\" is a fine hook! I'm now deeply enjoying The Dome, but I can't imagine reading it again. Once I know the answer, that'll be that.<br /><br />I hope one of these days he abandons his usual stripes, and writes The Great American Novel. He's got what it takes to produce something that benefits from many runs through, like Jane Austen, say, where what happens is secondary to the characters.  I'm ready, and so is he!<br /><br />I may well re-read On Writing, though. There's a lot of meat, and brilliantly presented, in that little book.
1439153663|5.0|This is a wonderful story about slavery in the 1790's to the early 1800's.  Lavinia is a young Irish girl coming to America with her parents and brother. Her parents die during the voyage and are buried at sea.  Lavinia, a small white girl with red air and blue eyes, is taken to the ship captain's plantation in Virginia.  She is placed in  the care of Belle, a black slave who is the illegimate daughter of the ship's captain. The story is told by Belle and Lavinia. The story follows Belle and Lavinia for many years. I found the characters to be very real and I soon cared for them and what happened to them. I highly recommend this book.

B002U33GUQ|2.0|Brad Mehldau, a wonderfully accomplished pianist and famous for his \\"Art of the Trio\\" discs, has dropped the ball. I can only hope it bounces back to him. Jazz with strings, a la Tommy LaPuma and others, is bad enough to begin with, but in this case one cannot decide if they're in the dentist's chair or an elevator. Slow moving, going nowhere in particular and just plain, old-fashioned dullsville. Brad has the talent, and he has the knowhow, but someone or some production force steered him down an awful path here. Please, Brad, don't disappoint us like this again!
B001OQCV6A|1.0|There is no point to his movie.  No story, no reason for being.  I thought that with Robert Downey Jr. in the cast it would be watchable.  The movie is totally lacking in atmosphere, casting, and storyline.  It, utterly, makes no sense.  I really like Robert Downey, but he wasted his time on this flix.
B003274QH6|5.0|Re: to those that whinge about the price for 7 episodes, what do these people want, 22 episodes of Cr*p, or 7 of quality?    This is amongst the finest TV that I've seen.    I've got the Blu-ray version, which is grainy compared to all the other Blu-ray and HDDVDs that I own, but in spite of that, I still gave it 5 stars.  Before anyone buys the Blu-ray version, I would advise them to compare the picture quality for the DVD and Blu-ray versions, and then decide which to buy.    The Blu-ray disc case is marked as suitable for regions ABC, but is in fact the discs are region A.
B0037AGASG|5.0|Some of you are judging this kid like he's an ADULT. Of COURSE his lyrics are going to be immature, his target audience is 8-16 year old GIRLS! And not to mention he's only a child himself! First some of you worry that kids today are growing up too fast, singing about sex, and when the ONE child pop star sings about things he's supposed to, you STILL judge him. I thought the album was very good. I'm 20 years old and I think Justin Bieber's music is very age appropriate for the audience that the music is being sold to. Some of you really need to get a grip.
006135323X|5.0|I watched a TED talk that Dan Ariely gave (which you can easily find on Google, if you're interested), and I immediately decided that I had to read this book. It's full of interesting examples that demonstrate how, contrary to common economic belief, humans actually don't make decisions in a rational way.<br /><br />Some points that stuck in my mind: we value things relatively rather than objectively; if we were in a store that sold a pen for $10, and we knew that we could walk a few blocks to get it for only $5, we would probably do that; but if we were buying a suit for $500, and knew that we could walk a few blocks to get it for only $495, we'd be much less likely to bother even though the effort required and the money saved is exactly the same in both cases.<br /><br />I was also intrigued by the chapter on social norms vs. market norms; people will often do something for free that they wouldn't do for a small amount of money, because in the first case it's a social thing while in the second case it's a market-value thing. So your neighbour will agree to help move your couch for nothing, but not if you offer to give him a dollar for it.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very intriguing book and I would definitely recommend it.
B001CTDH76|4.0|We loved the packaging and the DVDs. The case came with the interior pegs that hold the DVDs to the case broken so when we open the case the DVDs fall out. Shipping problem?? But the Mentalist was great.

B002N5N5M0|4.0|In Season 4 Dexter begins to take several risks with exposing his true identity.  He gets arrested, gets into a few really good fights. In my opinion, Season 1 was the best season followed by Season 2. I did not care for season 3 at all.  Season four, Dexter begins married life with Rita, her kids, and their new son.  There is also a return of FBI agent Lundy.<br /><br />The last five minutes of this season's series will leave you SHOCKED; and wanting to replay the whole episode to be sure you are really seeing the horrific scene that you are.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|This is what the FANS were expecting:    (1- NO we don't need the original version CD, we already HAVE that;)  2- A CD of the full original concert set list. Better still: two or three CD's with ALL material on it, from the four shows they taped for Ya-Ya's.  3- A booklet with interviews of people from the band. How about interviewing Mick Taylor? He's alive, findable, knowledgeable. His playing on these shows is nothing short of FORMIDABLE.  4- A DVD of the songs missing from the movie Gimme Shelter.    What we got was SOME more ammunition to put together the above listed.    It's OK. The people who COULD have done this right, may not have the same interest as we do. I'm sure the Stones themselves, IF they can be moved to enter a studio, want to record new material: they may not share the fans' obsession with the 'Mick Taylor period' (where the Stones IMHO found their sound).    I give this thing 5 stars nonetheless. I've got two Ya-Ya's LP's (worn out), a CD, a remastered CD, and now this. Add it to the bootlegs of most of the shows of this tour... This was musically just such a formidable time: Mick Taylor joined, and he and Keith really play together great (Keith plays about half the solos so his later complaint on the division of lead/rhythm guitar w Mick T is not yet valid here). The SOUNDS are so great too. And finally we get to hear the original second disc of Ya-Ya's, w material from Ike&Tina and BB, that well-intended plan back from when plans still were well-intended.    And it is with a smile that I see that the original title goes uncensored even in this age of newfound dam puritanism and censorship... ;-)
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I'm not going to pay this kind of money for something that I won't even own a hard copy of. Kindle books work, but only if the publisher realizes they have very little overhead and therefore need to pass along the savings (again, especially since we, the customer, won't even \\"own\\" the book).
B002UZCJP2|4.0|In a world of surrogates (high performance machines controlled by people). Looks like a bad guy found a way to bump of surrogates and their controllers.  Who is this perpetrator and why is he dispatching certain surrogates? Agent Greer (Bruce Willis) and his FBI partner (Radha Mitchell) Peters have to track down what appears to be a renegade until it looks like he is up against and internal cabal.<br /><br />Even though the director thinks that, he made some sort of unique story or used unique methods of photography like Panavision lenses. I hate to tell him but it has all been done before.<br /><br />After watching the coming attractions for this movie we get the while story before we start watching. Also based on a graphic novel again we just about get the whole story ahead of the film. What makes the film is the action and seeing how the novel will be adapted or ignored. The Director Jonathan Mostow is an action person so even though he claims that he is a character [person we know what he really is.<br /><br />I had fun with the story and think you will.  Now you can go two ways form here. For the techno-thriller, watch \\"I Robot\\" (2004). For the more human aspect of surrogates, watch \\"Sleep Dealer\\" (2008)

B0015XHP3G|5.0|To me, I can't enjoy just one part of Rambo - First Blood.  I've gotta see both!<br />The video was excellent, the audio was excellent, and the story is only topped by the 1st.  Where the 1st part identifies Rambo and builds character, it seems it's all to make this part happen.  This movie defines Rambo.  If you're a Rambo fan, you already know all of that.
B00337KM2S|5.0|THIS DVD worked beautifully.  It played!! And no stopping and starting in the previous DVD.  Really enjoyed the movie a lot.
B002VECM6S|2.0|The best thing in this movie is Sandra Bullock.. and it wasn't for her acting.  The movie was predictable, simple, not particularly believable (I know it's based on a true story), and Michael Oher is likely a little embarassed by how the writers/director decided to portray him in this movie.<br />I can't take away from the true story which I am deeply encouraged by.  Remember that Hollywood is extremely biased.  The people who rate movies and hand out awards are all hand-selected old rich liberals from CA, far off from mainstream.
0307266303|5.0|It's a fascinating story told in such a way that you can't wait for more.  The characters and the races are amazing (and insane!).  More importantly, the book is inspiring; it changes your entire perspective on running.  I'd swear that I can instantly run farther because I'm running for fun instead of for exercise.  Suddenly, I want to go run.  When I'm feeling tired or restless or I'm worried about something or just need to clear my head, I want to go run, and it feels great.  Best of all, for me, is that I'm now running barefoot (I wear FiveFingers; it's close to barefoot) and I have no knee pain anymore.  I've had knee surgery and it shut down nearly all exercise for me because my knee would ache.  But, running barefoot leaves me with no pain at all - not even a hint of discomfort.  It seems pretty obvious once someone says it - whether you ascribe to evolution or to a designer, surely either process engineered a foot that works without the need of artificial support.
B002KREVCO|4.0|Backtracks. I've been an AC/DC fan for a long time. I've got just about everything they've released. All except for the majority of what's on the CDs in this box set. There are some songs here, like Fling Thing, that might seem pointless, but, you know what, who cares. There are some really great early songs on here--as well as some from the late the eighties. Examples: Cold Hearted Man (excellent early song that rocks all the way), Crabsody In Blue (awesome blues-based tune that'll have you grinning as it rocks your socks off), Borrowed Time, Down on the Borderline (I've run these two eighties rockers into the ground), Big Gun (if you've never heard it before, and you're a big AC/DC fan, this is a treat), and, finally, Cyberspace. Just a great song that closes out the first disc. The second disc is all supposedly rare live stuff--and maybe that's the case on CD, but, I think, some of it was on Plug Me In (of course, the video portion of it). The DVD included with this particular version of Backtracks contains the various music videos the band has done over the years. Over all, if anything, this set is worth it for the studio rarities disc. The DVD is just a nice added bonus.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|An excellent film, I recommened for all generations. We need more such lessons learned, reflections from lived lives. It's honest, factual, and a dgood history prestentation in retrospective.
0743243153|4.0|This is a classic and a book everyone should read who is embarking on a road of self discovery. It was written over 20 years ago but still is a great introduction to how to start to explore the meaning of your life and the relationships around you. Peck has a pragmatic approach and when I first read this book it gave me insights that I had never been exposed to. This is the type of reading that should be presented in schools so that the next generation is exposed to a broader pespective of life. We are brought up in a certain reality and unless we are exposed to other realities we cannot expect to view life any differently than the previous generation.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings

0452295548|5.0|Not only have I read this lady's brave story, I have heard her speak. She has such passion, for life for living, that she just about didn't draw breath for the 2 and a half hours that she spoke! The way she describes her experiences, the honesty with which she relates the long journey is really remarkable. I feel it gives the lay person a wonderful insight into how the brain works from first hand experience, which I feel makes it a lot more accessable for people to get an understanding of our very complex brain. There is a spiritual element but it is very pragmatic and still in the context of her scientific background. It also shows how with determination and willpower a recovery can be achieved, and that was no easy journey as it took her 8 years to fully recover and be able to resume her profession. Many times we are not encouraged to seek this path of recovery because it all seems too hard, yet we don't realize that the lessons we learn along the way are invaluable.<br />Dr Gunts Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
B002AOWXO0|5.0|I had this album on mp3 format before purchasing the actual CD, and I have to admit, the CD sounds EVEN BETTER !  Breakup is not your average actress slash singer - pop star collaboration. Pete and Scarlett make a beautiful couple soundwise as well. I love this CD.
0060832819|5.0|I loved the Zahir. In the process of finding your soulmate you find yourself. Here is a woman who is prepared to lose her relationship to the man she loves because the relationship has reached its end - it has nowhere to go. In order for the relationship to move to a deeper more meaningful level a deepening of self is needed by the husband. It takes courage on the part of the woman not knowing whether she will as a result of leaving gain eventually a deepened relationship. In the meantime her husband finds many means of distraction as he is resisting the calling. Marvellous.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
0375413405|2.0|I bought this book because I was a big fan of Julia Child's cooking show and because of the movie Julie/Julia. I haven't cooked anything yet, but I feel like I am getting a good education in how to proceed in the right direction. One of my friends made a fish dish from this cookbook and I loved it. The thing is that I do not like fish and here I was enjoying a delicious fish dish. He made a six course dinner, and when I asked how he became such a good cook he recommended this book. If I can become a good cook like he is then it was worth buying this book.
0060589280|4.0|Even though the story may be about love, sex and desire, that is just the story. Read it on that level and it is enjoyable, but read it on the level of growth and it becomes a different novel. This is the challenge of taking risks, of daring to live differently and accepting the consequences. It takes courage to do that and it may not always work out how we would wish it to. Yet does that matter? Along the way we have learnt a great deal about ourselves and the world around us. Coelho is challenging us , asking us - do we have the courage to say yes to life or do we wish to live our fate? Excellent reading.<br />Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a really great movie. After watching so many so so movies lately, it was great to finally watch one worth the while. Be prepared it is a tear jerker. We watched it last night & I was still crying this a.m. when I thought about it. Definately recommended.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the 30 Day Shred a while back.  Last week I got it out because I am taking a trip and wanted to get rid of a little weight! Of course with just a month away I figured let's get the workout out.  How hard can it be?  Just 25 minutes right?  Boy, was I wrong.  I started it a week ago today, just one week ago.  I have lost 6lbs and 2 inches (yes, that is 2 inches) on my waist.  I still haven't moved up to level 2 even though I thought I was in decent shape aerobically.  Needless to say she kicks my butt!  I am sore and feel incredible.  On top of that you get 30 days free at her online site!  Her menu's rock and she really does give \\"sound\\" advice, hard work, but great!  If you want to feel good, get in shape and eat healthy, this is the trainer to look up!  Just be prepared this workout really works you out!!  Down 30lbs and 4 sizes after 3 months.  I am going to continue.  I love it and rotate with the Biggest Loser Cardio Max and The Firm Wave.  I also do Weight Watchers, no sense working out so hard if I am not watching what I eat or watching my portions!!  The two work great hand-in-hand.  Spend the few dollars, you will be thrilled you did!!
B00275EGWY|1.0|I am amazed to see how many people thought this was a good movie...poor plot, predictable, bad acting, bad directing, and super boring. This movie must have some weird hypnotic powers to control people's minds into believing it is great! Poor James Cameron who got screwed by his ex-wife with this crappy movie. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!
B0012Q732O|4.0|If you liked the prehistoric movies of the past, this one will fit just right.  Using modern animation, effects and sound, this one is a cut above many in this genre.  The quest for the love of his life is the thread in this action adventure.  But always remember the last line in \\"King Kong\\" - \\"It was beauty that killed the beast\\".  Even though it was rated PG13, you could definitely let the kids see this one.  It is rather tame for today's standards...and it is filled with devotion to family, friends and animals.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. Top notch acting (except for Brad Pitt) and edge of your seat action and drama. This movie should have won for the best film. Hurt Locker on the other hand was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|We love this one!  Tiana is the best princess ever.  And Ray, the lightening bug stole the show.  It is a must see.
0743298039|5.0|Very good book.  The author's word just flowed perfectly throughout the book.  Keeps you guessing the entire time.  It normally wouldn't be a book I would be interested in, but I am glad I read it.  I would definately recommend.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|Like many of us we have blu ray or soon will be. If you have a ps3 or a blu ray and needing to add to our library. If you have surround sound, this is a must. It's one of those movies that on blu ray the pq is great, but the sound is this film. Sit back and enjoy. If you live in an apt, you might want to get some headphones...if you live in a house....when you hear the opening theme you will know blu ray.

B002WCLG48|4.0|The product came in the expected condition. It was a little scratched, but then it wasn't listed as \\"like new\\" and it plays well, that's what really matters.

B00328G4V6|4.0|I am a true Hendrix fan! I bought the CD and I was lucky enough to have bought two of the 1st run limited edition vinyl copies (3134/5000 and 3135/5000), and now the 1st runs are all SOLD OUT.     When you buy 3 copies of the same album of an artist, you a true fan!    I can only mimic what someone else said in a recent review-this is STILL HENDRIX, and it's great to hear him wail again-there is some really good stuff on here!
0316172324|4.0|The individual chapters in this book sparkle, like everything Gladwell writes, but the book isn't a coherent whole.  We get the idea that we're better off being able instantaneously to \\"mind read\\" (i.e., read someone's intentions or emotions from their faces) than being like the autistic person who can't process these signals, and that those few of us who must make split second decisions like the police need to have such skills, but would we truly be better off in a universe where all of our thoughts and emotions could be read by others like an open book? If we had such a society wouldn't we all just have to spend time learning how to mask our emotions?  A trope through the book is the fact that a couple of art experts knew \\"right away\\" that the Getty kouros was a fake, but Gladwell doesn't mention the fact that other art experts equally well respected thought that it was not a fake.  (He sets up a dichotomy only between the one group of art experts and the science expert, ignoring the other group of art experts and making this seem like an open and shut case when it clearly wasn't.)  Gladwell gives us no clues as to how we are to choose between competing groups of experts each relying on both their intuition and expertise.  He raises the situation of medical experts having to triage patients coming to a hospital with chest pain (\\"too much information that we attempt to analyze rationally leads to error\\") but it turns out that analysis of vast amounts of objective data yields four factors that alone have virtually certain predictive factor as to whether a patient with chest pain needs to be admitted to a hospital.  It is true that physicians were getting distracted by too much information and also true that the Getty curators were getting a lot of scientific information that turned out to be irrelevant.  But beyond this similarity, the chest pain problem could be resolved only by close examination of the relevant data which turned out to be counter-intuitive, not byintuition.  In the case of the kouros, Gladwell is making the opposite point that the \\"real\\" art experts can't really say how they knew it was a fake and therefore intuition, based on experience, should properly rule in these sorts of cases.  Some fakes, however, will fool virtually everyone, and given that such an approach yields no method of resolving honest disagreements among experts with equivalent credentials, a modern society must reject it.  In both cases the actual issue is the same:  how to determine what we should measure, how to measure something in a way that will produce \\"real,\\" objective, verifiable data, what weight to give to each piece of data, etc.  The problem with the kouros was that some of the information that the Getty was relying on was fake and that there was no agreement on what factors to analyze or measure and what weight should be given to those factors.  The fact that the art experts who, in hindsight, turned out to be right can't articulate what led them to conclude that it was a fake does not prove, as Gladwell argues, that such determinations should properly be deemed to be forever beyond our reach.
B002O4J4DO|1.0|This collection is essential to any 60s, mono singles, music lover. One of the best ever. So it galls me that I have now ordered 2 copies from 2 different dealers that both proved defective. If you get a copy where one song sticks, return this to your dealer. Do not put up with it because it's only one song and you can download that one or something. I have informed concordmusicgroup of their manufacturing problem. I have never heard of concordmusicgroup, but I assume Fantasy has outsourced to them. It is really sad that all these beautiful packages with amazing sounding music are going to end up in a landfill. I am going to keep on trying until I get a good set. Unbelievable....AND EVEN MORE UNBELIVEABLE....I just got my third defective copy. Concordmusicgroup told me their CDs are not all made at the same plant. I have ordered one from the midwest, east coast, and now down south and they were all defective....
B001OQCV6K|4.0|The first thing to say is that I really did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did. However, there are points this review will touch on which I just didn't find fit in with the Sherlock Holmes universe. To take such an iconic character, and put a modern Hollywood twist to it, would undoubtedly generate some criticism from those who have read the original stories and are fans of the traditional Arthur Conan Doyle creation. Although there have been many incarnations of Sherlock Holmes in the cinema, this is the first to give Sherlock Holmes the big budget blockbuster panache that some thought would work well. As a stand-alone, the film worked well, but in comparison to one of literatures greatest creations, it just didn't work.<br /><br />The film naturally focuses on Holmes and his companion, Dr. Watson who are faced with possibly their most challenging investigation ever. Lord Blackwood, a serial killer who is executed for his crimes rises from the grave and is determined to use his supernatural powers to become leader of the British Empire and inevitably the world. Holmes has to use every facet of his talents to solve this mystery as he is faced with the supernatural, which he deems to be irrational. With the help of his friend Dr. Watson and a supporting cast of other great names in the novels such as Irene Adler and Inspector Letrade, Holmes works to solve one of the greatest mysteries he has undoubtedly ever faced.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed this film, but I felt it was too much and diverged too far away from the character in the books to the point it felt that the film was just capitalising on a familiar name. Guy Ritchie has accomplished something of worth, however, in that he has put one of my favourite literary characters on the silver screen and managed to make him cool. One thing I will point out which, although insignificant, makes all the difference to fans of the novels perceptions of the film. The very appearance of Holmes is something out of place with the era that he is meant to be representing. The absence of the deerstalker hat in favour of a fedora, although a small difference is something that I thought looked too contrived. An attempt to make the character look cool to draw favour from the image obsessed modern culture whilst insulting the fans of the novels who took the time to get to know the characters traits and his appearance.<br /><br />The actors for their respective roles did well. Mark Strong as the antagonist, Lord Blackwood made for a very intimidating foe. His mannerisms, appearance and dialogue formed a very definite character in considering his purpose and mission in the film. Not being much of a fan of Jude Law in general, I was critical of the man going into this film, but I found myself enjoying his performance and appreciating the fact that he makes the perfect on screen Dr. Watson. The big discussion though is about whether or not Downey Jr. performed well in the role as Sherlock Holmes. In a lot of ways, he did really well. Some of the characters mannerisms we performed as you'd expect them and he just presented an all round realistic portrayal of Holmes, however, the accent didn't really work for me as it appeared as the typical way the British accent would be portrayed in a Hollywood blockbuster.<br /><br />The setting of 19th century London was superb and overall, as I mentioned above, on its own, the film did a great job of providing two hours of good entertainment. I think a worthy alternative for Downey Jr. would have been Hugh Laurie taking on the iconic role. He is both experienced in playing a character based on Holmes, has a superb, natural British accent and is also known worldwide in one way or another whether that be for his work on House or his other work on UK TV. I would recommend this as a decent bit of light entertainment and the nods to the book are a welcome wink to fans of Conan Doyles literary creation.ith the era that he is meant to be representing.
